The Suppression of Science: The Case of Jeffrey MacDonald

A case in which science has not yet produced a victory—or, in my view, justice—is the 40 year
old “whodunit” involving the murder of the family of Jeffrey MacDonald. Science could perhaps
provide a definitive answer to this highly publicized case, but so far the doors of the courtroom
have been shut to newly discovered scientific and other evidence that was suppressed by the
prosecution. The courts in this case have placed the alleged need for “finality” above the search
for truth. But history and science knows no finality. Nor should finality trump the desire for
closure in a court of law, as long as a possibly innocent defendant remains convicted of a crime
that science can prove he may not have committed.

I had followed the Jeffrey MacDonald case in the media from its grisly inception on February 17,
1970, when the wounded Green Beret doctor told authorities that his pregnant wife, Colette, and
his daughters, Kimberly, five, and Kristen, two, had been murdered by drug-crazed intruders. Like
most Americans, I had my doubts about his story. It seemed so conveniently modeled on the
notorious Manson murders that had occurred just __ years earlier. I knew that the statistics
showed that wives are more likely to be killed by husbands than by strangers. I wondered why
there was no hard evidence—no fibers, hairs, or fingerprints—left by the alleged intruders. My
doubts were confirmed by reading Joe McGinniss's best-seller Fatal Vision, which concluded that
MacDonald was indeed guilty, or by seeing the TV movie, which was even more persuasive of his
guilt.

Several times during the course of the lengthy legal proceedings, Jeffrey MacDonald had written
and called me, pleading with me to help him. Each time I declined. But then, in 19 __, I went to
Terminal Island Federal Prison in California to visit another inmate, and as I left the room in
which lawyers confer with prisoners, a graying man quietly introduced himself. He was Jeffrey
MacDonald, and he asked if he could have five minutes of my time to show me some documents.
I agreed. What I learned that day—and afterward—convinced me that I had to try to help him.

In one of the most dramatic scenes in the TV movie Fatal Vision, investigators dig up the graves
of Colette, Kimberly, and Kristen MacDonald. The government's chief lawyer (played by Andy
Griffith) explains to the grieving Freddie Kassab (played by Karl Maiden) why the bodies of his
stepdaughter and grandchildren must be exhumed:

We've got to know if the hair found in Colette's hand was her own, Jeff's,
the kids’...
[Freddie Kassab interjects] . . . or someone with a floppy hat.

In the actual trial conducted in 1979, the prosecution's case against Jeffrey MacDonald relied
heavily on this evidence: blonde hair found in the murdered Colette MacDonald's hand. It had
already been found not to match Jeffrey MacDonald's hair. Thus, if it did not match Colette's own
hair or the hair of the children, that finding would lend support to MacDonald's claim that there
had been intruders - - including a woman with long, blonde hair who was wearing a floppy hat
and boots - - in his home on the night of the attack. It would also indicate that at least one of
these intruders had come in contact with Colette.

I argued that the prosecutors had deliberately “thrown a skunk into the jury box” when they
introduced irrelevant evidence that Swami had engaged in a homosexual relationship with a
follower. To a West Virginia jury back then, this could be massively prejudicial.

In addition, the prosecution introduced evidence that teachers at the community school had
molested children and that Swami was aware of this but did nothing. Finally, they introduced:

“a videotape segment from the television program West 57th Street (a news exposé
program). The videotape showed a child of the New Vrindaban community stating that he
prayed to Swami, a statement generally offensive to the religious sensitivities of typical
jurors. More inflammatory was a statement by Swami comparing women to dogs and
condoning lightly slapping one's wife for disciplinary reasons.”

I argued the appeal before a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit consisting
of three elderly conservative judges in Charleston, South Carolina. I could not imagine a group
that would be less sympathetic to a Hare Krishna guru accused of the horrendous crimes of which
my client stood convicted. But my wife’s older cousin, Morris Rosen, an experienced lawyer
from Charleston, cautioned me not to give up. “These old-line Southerners care about justice,
and they don’t have ambitions beyond their current job. They’ll give your client a fair shake as
long as you don’t overstate your case. Be straight with them and they’ll be straight with you.”

My cousin, who was himself “a good ol’ boy,” was absolutely on target. I argued in a low key
manner, focusing on precedents from the court, and especially from the three judges. In their
decision, they followed the law, concluding as follows:

“We accept without need of extensive argument that implications of child molestation,
homosexuality, and abuse of women unfairly prejudice a defendant. Indeed, no evidence
could be more inflammatory or more prejudicial than allegations of child molestation.
When evidence of a defendant's involvement in several of these activities is presented to
the jury, the risk of unfair prejudice is compounded. In such a case, we fear that jurors will
convict a defendant based on the jurors' disdain or their belief that the defendant's prior
bad acts make guilt more likely. Furthermore, we are especially sensitive to prejudice in a
trial where defendants are members of an unpopular religion.”

The court in a 2-1 decision reversed the convictions. The rule of law prevailed over the
prejudices of men and women.

credit versus investment grade fixed income and by
funding various tactical tilts from their high-quality
bond allocation. While most investment grade
bonds may have uninspiring tactical prospects, we
emphasize that investors should not completely
abandon their bond allocation in search of higher
yields. As the last several years have reminded
us, investment grade fixed income serves a vital
strategic role in the portfolio, due to its ability to
hedge against deflation, reduce portfolio volatility
and generate income.

In the sections that follow, we review the
specifics of each fixed income market.

US Treasuries

While 2016 began as a bumper year for US
Treasuries, it ended in a rout. The yield on 10-year
Treasury bonds, for example, reached an all-time
low of just 1.36% by the middle of last year before
jolting higher by more than one percentage point
by year-end. As a result, investors’ nearly double-
digit gains devolved into a small loss. Even worse,
the bulk of the rate increase occurred in just the
last three months of 2016, generating a 7% loss for
the quarter that has been exceeded less than 1% of
the time historically since 1981.

We expect rates to continue to increase, albeit
at a slower pace in 2017, as many of the forces
that have restrained yields are slowly fading.
Inflation, in particular, has been a persistent drag,
reflecting a toxic combination of excess labor slack
that depressed wages, a strong dollar that lowered
import prices and a significant decline in oil prices
that weighed on breakeven inflation rates. But
as we begin the eighth year of the US expansion,
labor slack has been largely absorbed, evident in
today’s firming wages. Moreover, the impact of the
dollar is diminishing as its pace of ascent slows,
while the recovery in oil is boosting breakeven
inflation rates.

Other headwinds are also receding. The fiscal
austerity among the advanced economies that
has dampened economic growth and decreased
sovereign bond issuance—both of which depress
interest rates—is now reversing (see Exhibit 78).
Indeed, US fiscal spending is expected to add
0.3-0.5 percentage points to GDP growth in each
of the next two years.!4

At the same time, there is reduced demand
for risk-free assets, like US Treasuries, given
the unexpectedly sanguine reaction to negative

geopolitical events—such as the UK and Italian
referenda—and the results of the US election.
Finally, the deleterious impact of depressed interest
rates on banking sector profitability has raised the
hurdle for global central banks to cut interest rates
further and/or increase the scale of QE programs. In
turn, market focus has shifted toward the eventual
tapering of BOJ, ECB and BOE accommodation,
which has helped lift bond term premiums and
boosted long-term yields (see Exhibit 79).

In light of these waning headwinds, the Federal
Reserve is likely to hike two or three times in 2017,
with upside risks from a larger-than-anticipated
fiscal expansion. Combined with some further
normalization in the term premium, we expect 10-
year rates to increase to 2.50-3.00% by year-end.
Given the balance of risks, we remain comfortable
funding tactical tilts out of investment grade
fixed income.

Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)
TIPS fared better than nominal bonds in 2016,
delivering a positive mid-single-digit return. Their
outperformance was driven by the recovery in
breakeven inflation rates, which began the year at
very depressed levels consistent with only 1.5%
annual inflation over the next 10 years—well
below long-run forecasts (see Exhibit 80). In fact,
our work suggests that breakeven inflation rates
were reflecting high odds of a deep recession over
the course of 2016, well above the risk suggested
by our recession models.

you receive the bulk of e-mail from your most important contacts. These “hotspots” are batching times
that will enable you to keep critical contacts (clients, bosses, etc.) smiling even while you reduce
checking e-mail to 1-3 times per day. It will also populate your contacts automatically by pulling phone
numbers, addresses, etc., from separate e-mail buried in the inbox.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020073.txt,"“Mika and Joe totally love this. It’s big ratings for them,” said the president, with
certain satisfaction and obvious truth.

OOK Ok

Ten days later, a large table of Bannonites was having dinner at the Bombay Club, a high-
end Indian restaurant two blocks from the White House. One of the group—Arthur
Schwartz, a PR consultant—asked a question about the Mika and Joe affair.

Perhaps it was the noise, but it was also a fitting measure of the speed of events in the
Trump era: Bannon lieutenant Alexandra Preate replied, with genuine fogginess, “Who?”

The operetta of the Mika tweets—the uncouthness and verbal abuse demonstrated by
the president, his serious lack of control and judgment, and the worldwide censure heaped
upon him for it—had already far receded, wholly overshadowed by more Trump eruptions
and controversy.

But before moving on to the next episode of ohmygodness, it is worth considering the
possibility that this constant, daily, often more than once-a-day, pileup of events—each
one canceling out the one before—is the true aberration and novelty at the heart of the
Trump presidency.

Perhaps never before in history—not through world wars, the overthrow of empires,
periods of extraordinary social transformation, or episodes of government-shaking scandal
—have real-life events unfolded with such emotional and plot-thickening impact. In the
fashion of binge-watching a television show, one’s real life became quite secondary to the
public drama. It was not unreasonable to say Whoa, wait just a minute: public life doesnt
happen like this. Public life in fact lacks coherence and drama. (History, by contrast,
attains coherence and drama only in hindsight.)

The process of accomplishing the smallest set of tasks within the sprawling and
resistant executive branch is a turtle process. The burden of the White House is the
boredom of bureaucracy. All White Houses struggle to rise above that, and they succeed
only on occasion. In the age of hypermedia, this has not gotten easier for the White House,
it’s gotten harder.

It’s a distracted nation, fragmented and preoccupied. It was, arguably, the peculiar
tragedy of Barack Obama that even as a transformational figure—and inspirational
communicator—he couldn’t really command much interest. As well, it might be a central
tragedy of the news media that its old-fashioned and even benighted civic-minded belief
that politics is the highest form of news has helped transform it from a mass business to a
narrow-cast one. Alas, politics itself has more and more become a discrete business. Its
appeal is B-to-B—business-to-business. The real swamp is the swamp of insular, inbred,
incestuous interests. This isn’t corruption so much as overspecialization. It’s a wonk’s life.
Politics has gone one way, the culture another. The left-right junkies might pretend
otherwise, but the great middle doesn’t put political concerns at the top of their minds.

were going to be a lot tougher. Israel now had control of the entire Sinai and the
Golan. To tap into enemy communications, we would have to push deeper
inside Egypt and Syria.

Soon after my return, we began planning the sayeret’s most ambitious
mission so far: targeting the main communications system between Suez City,
at the southern end of the canal, and Egyptian military headquarters in Cairo.
We were obviously going to have to go in by helicopter. But we faced not just
the risk of being spotted on the way in. The buildup of Egyptian forces along
the canal now included Soviet-made anti-aircraft missile batteries. We might
easily get shot down.

The mission struck the generals in the kirya as so risky as to border on the
insane. But I was confident that we could make it work. I began talking to the
few senior air force officers who seemed more receptive, as well as to officers
in the helicopter units. Not only had I flown into the Sinai on earlier missions. I
now also had a physics degree. Together, we developed a plan — using the desert
terrain, and drawing on the helicopters’ maneuverability — to calculate a flight
route that could avoid detection by Egyptian radar. As an extra fail-sale, I
proposed using three helicopters, and three sayeret teams. Two would fly
slightly higher, with the express aim of getting spotted, but still evading missile
fire. They would land far away from the real target of the operation. The main
team, with me in command, would also stage a pair of diversionary attacks:
planting explosives on a high-voltage electricity cable, and on the main oil
pipeline from Suez City to Cairo.

Still, for many weeks, the answer from the Airya was no. The man who had
succeeded Rabin as chief-of-staff after the war, Chaim Bar-Lev, dismissed it as
“a plan built on chicken legs.” In the end, what got us the green light was a
further escalation, on both sides, in the War of Attrition. In January 1970, Israeli
warplanes began a series of deep-penetration bombing raids, for the first time
striking targets dozens of miles, in some case hundreds of miles, back from the
canal. The Israeli bombing campaign reduced the chance we’d get shot down and
provided cover for our operation.

Our helicopters took off after sunset, nearly skimming the water and peeling
off in separate directions on the far shore. The other two aircraft headed 120
miles to the south. I led the main team of ten men. We set down a few miles
south of the road from Suez City to Cairo. We unloaded a pair of Jeeps, drove
off, and within an hour had placed our time-delay explosives on the electricity

building a waste water treatment plant or

he told me. Unfortunately we have to do
that because the Palestinian Authority does
not have the funding and the donors let [the
PA] down.

There might be a political calculation
behind Qatar's decision to throw an amount
of money equivalent to two years of U.S.
financial aid to the PA behind a single
private-sector figure like Masri. Qatar
recently announced plans to invest nearly
$400 million in the Hamas-controlled Gaza
Strip, and in October of 2012, Qatari Emir
Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani
became the first head of state to visit the
Strip after the Islamist militant group's
2007 takeover. Hamas politburo chief
Khaled Meshaal lives in Doha, and Qatar
Diar is financing a major development in
Sudan, whose cash-strapped government
enjoys close relations with Iran, and has
facilitated the transfer of long-range
rockets to Hamas. In short, Qatar supports
an E.U. and U.S. listed terrorist
organization bitterly opposed to both Israel
and the current PA leadership. And it also
has no problem investing in Rawabi.
According to Kamran Bokhari, vice
president of Middle Eastern and South
Asian affairs for Stratfor, Qatari support for
Hamas is part of the sheikhdom's larger,

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016836.txt,"whereas the iron-eating bactertum Thiobacillus ferrooxidans 1s thrilled. Who’s to
say the bacterium is wrong? The fact that a machine has been given a fixed
objective by humans doesn’t mean that it will automatically recognize the
importance to humans of things that aren’t part of the objective. Maximizing the
objective may well cause problems for humans, but, by definition, the machine
will not recognize those problems as problematic.

e Intelligence is multidimensional, “so ‘smarter than humans’ is a meaningless
concept.”® It is a staple of modern psychology that IQ doesn’t do justice to the
full range of cognitive skills that humans possess to varying degrees. IQ is indeed
a crude measure of human intelligence, but it is utterly meaningless for current AI
systems, because their capabilities across different areas are uncorrelated. How
do we compare the IQ of Google’s search engine, which cannot play chess, with
that of DeepBlue, which cannot answer search queries?

None of this supports the argument that because intelligence is multifaceted,
we can ignore the risk from superintelligent machines. If “smarter than humans”
is a meaningless concept, then “smarter than gorillas” is also meaningless, and
gorillas therefore have nothing to fear from humans; clearly, that argument
doesn’t hold water. Not only is it logically possible for one entity to be more
capable than another across all the relevant dimensions of intelligence, it is also
possible for one species to represent an existential threat to another even if the
former lacks an appreciation for music and literature.

Solutions

Can we tackle Wiener’s warning head-on? Can we design AI systems whose purposes
don’t conflict with ours, so that we’re sure to be happy with how they behave? On the
face of it, this seems hopeless, because it will doubtless prove infeasible to write down
our purposes correctly or imagine all the counterintuitive ways a superintelligent entity
might fulfill them.

If we treat superintelligent AI systems as if they were black boxes from outer
space, then indeed we have no hope. Instead, the approach we seem obliged to take, if
we are to have any confidence in the outcome, is to define some formal problem /’, and
design AI systems to be F-solvers, such that no matter how perfectly a system solves F,
we're guaranteed to be happy with the solution. If we can work out an appropriate F' that
has this property, we’ll be able to create provably beneficial AI.

Here’s an example of how nof to do it: Let a reward be a scalar value provided
periodically by a human to the machine, corresponding to how well the machine has
behaved during each period, and let F' be the problem of maximizing the expected sum of
rewards obtained by the machine. The optimal solution to this problem is not, as one
might hope, to behave well, but instead to take control of the human and force him or her
to provide a stream of maximal rewards. This is known as the wireheading problem,
based on observations that humans themselves are susceptible to the same problem if
given a means to electronically stimulate their own pleasure centers.

There is, I believe, an approach that may work. Humans can reasonably be
described as having (mostly implicit) preferences over their future lives—that is, given

One of the most important questions we must address is just when our Club might open again. The
Club is closed through October 7 and Member Services is not presently taking any reservations through
December 17. There is a strong possibility that our re-start date could hinge on when the rest of St.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013046.txt,"130 7 A Formal Model of Intelligent Agents

about the dynamics of general intelligence, which has been useful in guiding development of the
ECAN component of CogPrime, and we expect will have more general value in future.

Despite the intermittent use of mathematical formalism, the ideas presented in this section
are fairly speculative, and we do not propose them as constituting a well-demonstrated theory
of general intelligence. Rather, we propose them as an interesting way of thinking about general
intelligence, which appears to be consistent with available data, and which has proved inspira-
tional to us in conceiving concrete structures and dynamics for AGI, as manifested for example
in the CogPrime design. Understanding the way of thinking described in these chapters is valu-
able for understanding why the CogPrime design is the way it is, and for relating CogPrime to
other practical and intellectual systems, and extending and improving CogPrime.

7.2 A Simple Formal Agents Model (SRAM)

We now present a formalization of the concept of “intelligent agents” — beginning with a for-
malization of “agents” in general.

Drawing on [Iut05, LM07a], we consider a class of active agents which observe and explore
their environment and also take actions in it, which may affect the environment. Formally,
the agent sends information to the environment by sending symbols from some finite alphabet
called the action space 7; and the environment sends signals to the agent with symbols from
an alphabet called the perception space, denoted P. Agents can also experience rewards, which
lie in the reward space, denoted R, which for each agent is a subset of the rational unit interval.

The agent and environment are understood to take turns sending signals back and forth,
yielding a history of actions, observations and rewards, which may be denoted

a1,0171aA909Pr9...

or else

A,X AQX)...

if a is introduced as a single symbol to denote both an observation and a reward. The
complete interaction history up to and including cycle t is denoted aa1..; and the history before
cycle t is denoted ave, = ax14_1.

The agent is represented as a function 7 which takes the current history as input, and pro-
duces an action as output. Agents need not be deterministic, an agent may for instance induce a
probability distribution over the space of possible actions, conditioned on the current history. In
this case we may characterize the agent by a probability distribution 7(a:|av<¢). Similarly, the
environment may be characterized by a probability distribution (7, lav <,ax). Taken together,
the distributions 7 and y define a probability measure over the space of interaction sequences.

Next, we extend this model in a few ways, intended to make it better reflect the realities of
intelligent computational agents. The first modification is to allow agents to maintain memories
(of finite size), via adding memory actions drawn from a set M into the history of actions,
observations and rewards. The second modification is to introduce the notion of goals.

Do You Know This Guy? 
He is Edward Ed Mezvinsky, born January 17, 1937. And so who is 
Ed Mezvinsky? 
Well, he is a former Democrat congressman who represented Iowa's 
1st congressional district in the United States House of 
Representatives for two terms, from 1973 to 1977. 
He sat on the House Judiciary Committee that decided the fate of 
Richard Nixon. 
He was outspoken saying that Nixon was a crook and a disgrace to 
politics and the nation and should be impeached. 
He and the Clintons were friends and very politically intertwined for 
many years. 
Ed Mezvinsky had an affair with NBC News reporter Marjorie Sue 
Margolies and later married her after his wife divorced him. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026613 
In 1993, Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, then a freshman Democrat in 
Congress, cast the deciding vote that got President Bill Clinton's 
controversial tax package through the House of Representatives. 
In March 2001, Mezvinsky was indicted and later pleaded guilty to 31 
of 69 counts of federal criminal bank fraud, mail fraud, and wire fraud. 
Ed Mezvinsky embezzled more than $10 million dollars from people 
via both a Ponzi scheme and the notorious Nigerian e-mail scams. 
He was found guilty and sentenced to 80 months in federal prison. 
After serving less than five years in federal prison, he was released in 
April 2008 and remains on federal probation. 
To this day, he still owes $9.4 million in restitution to his many 
victims. 
About now you are saying, So what! 
Well, this is Marc and Chelsea Mezvinsky. 
That's right; Ed Mezvinsky is Chelsea Clinton's father-in law. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026614 
Now Marc and Chelsea are in their early thirties and purchased a $10.5 
million NYC apartment. 
Has anyone heard mention of any of this in any of the media? 
If this guy was Jenna or Barbara Bush's, or better yet, Sarah Palin's 
daughter's father-in- law, the news would be an everyday headline and 
every detail would be reported over and over and over. 
And yet liberals say there are no double standards in political 
reporting. 
And people are already talking about Hillary as our next 
President! 
And then there is possibly Chelsea for president in our 
future! 
The cycle never ends! 
Lying and corruption seem to make Democrat 
candidates more popular.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013720.txt,"The number and variety of algorithmic strategies for computing Lyapounov
exponents that are applicable to real data divide naturally into those that compute

directly the average rate of separation of neighboring points from the “fiduciary”

orbit, as observed on the reconstructed attractor, from which only the largest 2can
be obtained (Wolf et al, 1985), and a variety of techniques based on assumed
model maps of the unknown flow along which the sequential products of the local
derivatives are computed. The logarithms of the straight line slopes of the sequence
of directionally decomposed local tangent vectors multiplied, yield as many
Lyapounov exponents as directions (Sano and Sawaka, 1985; Eckmann et al, 1986;
Geist et al, 1990). The techniques of regularization by which these model processes
approximate the unknown flow include those with least squares, linear fit
assumptions (Eckmann et al, 1986; Sato et al, 1987; Buzug et al, 1990), more
detailed fits involving polynomial expressions in higher powers (Briggs, 1990; Brown
et al, 1991; Bryant et al, 1991) and techniques such as “singular value
decomposition” which decomposes the flow into orthogonal components before
computing the logarithmic rate of divergence of nearby points on each of them
(Stoop and Parisi, 1991). A clever check on the Lyapounov number obtained is to
study the flow backwards so that, for example, some rate of separation of points in
the forward direction would approximate the rate of convergence in the time
reversed data (Parlitz, 1992).

Among the sources of spurious Lyapounov exponents are sample lengths
that are too short and/or too measurement-noisy to compute a statistically stable
average, embedding dimensions that are too high or low and attractors (many of
physiological relevance) that have geometric features such as sharp corners or tight
folds as in the Réssler (where points gather) or delicate boundary points such as
those on the body on the Lorenz butterfly (see above) where very small distances
determine whether the orbit makes big jumps to the right or left wing leading to
uncharacteristically large separations. This “nonuniformity” in the rates of expansion
and contraction in the dynamics over the attractor, a source of error in computations
of statistical indices of the average behavior, becomes a _ useful tool in

characterizing individual differences in sets of neurobiological data ranging from

I have mixed emotions about what transpired today. really, You saw first hand in nauseating detail
what i have been saying to you for quite a while now. —_Joslins answers were totally incomprehensible.
the charts he prepared unreadable. Brads defensive posture was at a minum very surprising . He and I
have recently gotten along quite well , I thought . Neither Joslin or Brad understood a 180 million dollar

emblematic of a sloppy office , brad said lets not talk about emblems??! bill pay , admittedly no change

Im aware that seeing what you saw frustrated you. I felt badly for you.

not for this year. for next year its the same 40 m as always, paid 20 in jan and 20 in july, and then we are
done. I will give you advice and counsel but new people will be running your operating machine. _I will
oversee all the work that needs to be done you and I will hire new people , and it will be self running. ( it
was may in my house when you told brad it had been 5 months and you were getting fed up ) I will set up
a parallel . office , somenoe like wendy dolman or her quality is paramount. two accountants two
bookeepers and two office admins. . alan and zoe will handle trusts and grats. heatehr diana george will
be incolved in art partnership. if you want brad, analysts etc. and kids to do investments I have little to
add in that regard ,except to be able to account for things properly. I suggest that the kids must have skin
in any deal.

Alternatively , we can continue to focus on fun and let someone else do the things that you want done.

life or death. In Atkins v. Virginia, the US Supreme Court found a person
with mental disability, defined as having an IQ of less than 80, cannot be
executed.

IQ is not really a measurement, in the normal sense. Most
measurements in life are absolute, for example, distance, weight, and time.
I can prove my house is bigger than yours using a tape measure. We each
ensure our measures are the same by calibrating them against a common
reference. In the 1900s we could have walked down to the local town hall
and checked our measurements against a ‘yardstick. As measurements
became standardized, these sticks were compared with a common central
reference. For example, the metre was a platinum-iridium bar kept at the
Pavillon de Breteuil near Paris. In the 1960s, a laser superseded the metal
reference, and today a metre is defined as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of the
orange-red emission line in the electromagnetic spectrum of krypton-86
in a vacuum. Measurement has become very precise!

Intelligence is different. It has no yardstick. If I were to ask, “How
much intelligence does it take to design a building?” there’s no simple
answer. IQ is not an absolute measurement - it’s a relative score. Test
100 people and list their scores in order. The ones in the middle get a
score of 100; the top 5 a score of at least 130 and the top person a score
of 140. Similarly at the lower end. A person with a high IQ is probably
smarter than one with a low IQ, but it doesn’t tell you if the building
they designed will stand up. It’s rather like quoting the odds of a horse
winning the Derby. Quoting the odds does not give the speed of the
horse, nor often the winner of the race!

Despite attempts by test creators to remove cultural bias, it can
never be completely eliminated. Certain Amazonian tribes have no
concept of counting above five. For them, numbers are an alien idea and
serve no useful purpose in their habitat. In the jungle there are always
enough trees to make spears, and as a hunter-gatherer you simply need
to know where to find your prey. There is no need to count animals into
an enclosure at night. Another interesting environment is the Australian
Outback. Aboriginal Australians appear to have a remarkable aptitude for
visio-spatial memory and can remember maps or collections of objects
much better than you or I. Tests for this skill involve playing a variant
of Pelmanism. A collection of objects is placed on a tray and covered
with a cloth. The cloth is lifted for 60 seconds to reveal the location and
type of objects and then replaced. Subjects are then given a bucket full of
objects and asked to recreate the tray. You and I do a modest job. Native
Australians do this almost perfectly. Why?

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025152.txt,"ENDURANCE

A Natural History of Exercise and Health
By Daniel Lieberman
[Proposal; Delivery: April 2019; 120,000 words]

Endurance is the new book from Daniel Lieberman, Chair of the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at
Harvard, and author of The Story of the Human Body, a New York Times bestseller. Lieberman is well known for
his unique and unusually integrative approach to research, which combines paleontology, anatomy, physiology
and experimental biomechanics.

Endurance, Lieberman writes, argues that we need to rethink how we think about exercise using the dual
lenses of anthropology and evolutionary biology. As the modern word ‘exercise’ itself implies, people today
generally think of physical activity as a pastime or a form of medicine. Most of us spend the majority of the day
sitting and then we briefly exercise in our spare time, sometimes for fun, but increasingly to ward off ill health.
Yet, until very recently, physical activity was a paradoxically fundamental part of being human: utterly
necessary but instinctively avoided. Put simply, we evolved to be reluctant endurance athletes.

This legacy underlies and points to urgently needed solutions for today’s exercise dilemma. Everyone knows
that exercise is vital for good health, yet the vast majority of Americans and others in the developed world are
unable to exercise enough. Our species endured because we had no choice but to be athletes, and if we wish our
health to endure as individuals, then we still need to make exercise indispensable today. Rather than thinking of
exercise as a ‘magic pill' for good health, it is the absence of physical activity, primarily endurance exercise, that
accelerates aging and hastens death. Endurance points to a new way of understanding and solving this global
problem.

Endurance is the product of a long journey, part intellectual, part physical. Over the last decade I have
traversed the globe to observe, often as a participant, how humans are physically active in different traditional
cultures from Africa to Greenland to India. Among other experiences, I’ve run barefoot and carried water on my
head in Kenya, tracked muskoxen and kudu with indigenous hunters in Greenland and Tanzania, participated in
the ancient Tarahumara ballgame under the stars in Mexico, dug millet fields in Rwanda, played barefoot cricket
in rural India, and raced on foot against horses in the mountains of Arizona. Back in my lab at Harvard, my
students and IJ have intensively studied the evolution, biomechanics and physiology of key human physical
activities, including how we walk, run, throw, dig, climb and even chew.

Endurance weaves together these experiences, perspectives and insights into the form of a highly personal
natural history of first rest, then strength, and finally endurance.

DANIEL LIEBERMAN 1s a professor and chair of the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard.
A leader in the field of human evolutionary biology, Lieberman’s research asks how and why evolution made the
human body the way it is. He is the author of The Story of the Human Body (Pantheon, 2013) and has been
published in such journals as Nature, Science, and The Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, among
others. Lieberman has been interviewed by PBS, The History Channel, NPR, BBC, Horizon, and elsewhere.
His research and discoveries have been highlighted in the New York Times, Discover, National Geographic,
Runners World, Running Times, and numerous other journals and newspapers.

Edwards vs Mr Jeffrey Epstein 
Dear Sirs: 
We are preparing an article about the calendaring today of Mr Edwards' claim against Mr Epstein for jury trial 
and the witness list which names 
victims of Mr Epstein. 
and other young women who allege they were underage 
Mr Edwards claims that Mr Epstein maliciously attempted to intimidate him and his clients into retracting their 
claims. 
further has stated to us that she intends to testify that she was flown to London by Mr Epstein and 
instructed to have sex at age 17 with Prince Andrew. She alleges that she was paid $15k for this encounter. 
She claims that on another occasion, Mr Epstein flew two young women to a dinner for the purpose of 
entertaining President Clinton. She claims she herself was sex trafficked to several other men, whose contact 
information is contained in an address book of Mr Epstein's filed in court records. 
May we have a comment please? Our deadline is 1pm tomorrow (SATURDAY) ET. 
Yours sincerely,

Dear Jeffrey, 
My name is Leah Reis-Dennis, and I'll be heading operations for Lisa's new non-profit, Verse Video 
Education. She's asked me to be in touch with you about helping us get a release from Woody Allen. 
First, I wanted to send along the rough stringout of footage from the conversation with Woody a couple of 
years ago on This is Just to Say by William Carlos Williams. This is totally unedited and uncut footage, but 
we would love the opportunity to turn it into something great. 
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cObnlii xeo0654g/uWZ6KBVbLS?preview=WoodyAllen+Basic+Clip+for+Viewing.mov  
If Woody Allen agrees to let us use the footage, he will be in distinguished company. To date, we have filmed 
conversations about poetry with dozens of distinguished Americans including: 
Bill Clinton 
Al Gore 
John McCain 
Mayor Rahm Emanuel 
Mayor Tom Menino 
Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan 
Sir Mervyn King 
Former Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers 
The conversation would be part of a large multiplatform initiative that Harvard Professor Lisa New has under 
way to bring poetry into the mainstream, and, especially, into English Language Arts classrooms in the United 
States and around the world. The initiative, Poetry in America, includes a HarvardX online course, a television 
series we're creating with WGBH to be paired with PBS LearningMedia segments for the classroom, and, a 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029253 
series of online professional development courses we're creating for ELA Middle and High School teachers 
and for their students. 
Let us know if Woody Allen might be open to our sending another release form his way. Of course, if he's 
interested in releasing the footage for only certain parts of our project, we're open to having a conversation 
about that, too. 
Thank you, and I hope to meet you soon. 
Best, Leah

decreasing with muscle fatigue (Rapp et al, 1993; Nieminen and Takala, 1996;

acromegalic patients with functioning pituitary adenomas manifested a statistically
significant increase in Do when compared with age-matched controls (Mandell and
Selz, 1997) which corresponded nicely to the reduction in “approximate entropy”
(Pincus, 1991a) computed on this same data set (Hartman et al, 1994). On the
other hand, comparative in vitro studies of growth hormone release patterns in
normal rat pituitary cells and their neoplastically transformed relatives, the GH3
strain, demonstrate a decrease in Do in the latter (Guillemin et al, 1983; Mandell,
1986).

The “War on Terror” After Snowden

Because of a number of unauthorized disclosures and a lot of
hand-wringing over the government's role in the effort to try to
uncover these terrorists, there have been some policy and legal
and other actions that make our ability collectively, internation-
ally, to find these terrorists much more challenging.

—CIA DIRECTOR JOHN BRENNAN,

in response to the Paris terrorist attack, November 2015

Ox THE EVENING of November 13, 2015, nine jihadist terror-
ists acting on behalf of ISIS brought normal life in Paris to a
screeching halt. Three suicide bombers blew themselves up at the
stadium at Saint-Denis while President Hollande was inside attend-
ing a match between France and Germany. Other terrorists that
night killed 130 people at cafés, restaurants, and a theater. Three
hundred and eighty-eight others were wounded in the carnage.
Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a twenty-cight-year-old Belgian citizen of
Moroccan origins who served ISIS as a logistics officer in Syria in
2014, planned the attack over many months with the help of others
in Syria. To organize it, they smuggled three suicide bombers into
Europe through Greece, raised financing, set up a base in the Molen-
beek section of Brussels, imported deactivated assault weapons from
Slovenia that were restored by a technician, bought ammunition,
acquired suicide vests, obtained “burner” cell phones, rented cars,
and, two months before the attack, rented three additional apart-
ments under fake identities to conceal the operation. Finally, in

The bots did the sweep. Here are the new results taken as of a minute ago. You have only one negative article
left on front page of google, which is the Huffington Post article. The Huffington Post is extremely hard to
move, because it is so powerful, has millions of links to it, and uploads massive new and original content it on
a daily basis with posting from out side readers. We managed to push it down the page, as it used to be at the
top. If we were able to post original content to both the science and the org site (absolutely not a single word
to this day by Jessica, just talk), we would have been able to push it down even further, and off the page. WE
did manage to get rid of the daily beast article, which is now far removed, inspite of their own efforts to keep
it prominent.

Toxic suggested search engine terms that popped up automatically when you typed in your name are also now
removed.

Wikipedia was an important victory, as it will always be at the top of the search engine results. ow the head
lines do not mention convicted sex offender or pedophile. Instead, Philanthrophic work, Epstein Foundation,
Promotion of Scientists. We have stopped the hacking on your wiki site, and that was a major effor. Your
wiki entry now is pretty tame, and bad stuff has been muted, bowlerized, and pused to the bottom. Careful
editing and wording has muted the effect immensely. We hacked the site to replace the mug shot and caption,
and now has an entirely different photo and caption. This was a big success.

We pushed the Edge all the way up to the front page, where it was previously buried on page 5 of google
search.

We have promoted the other jeffrey epsteins, and other pages are also filled with your material.

And, while the sites are up, and in the direction we hoped, they are still new, and subject to volitility,
especially if new original content is not added on a minimum of a weekly basis. I have been forbideen to add
new content to the philanthrophic site as well as the science site, and therefore, as a result our rating slipped
down (still on the first page, but would have liked them (and some of the articles to been able to push
Huffington off page). We also helped with you images, and the first images that come of you on a google
search are not of your mug shot, etc.

Your daily beast foe is still at it, and trying to promote her sites against you in the same way that we try to
depromote you.

As far as this site is concerned, and the continuation of this, I do not know what you wish to do. Clearly, you
have no interest in my continuing. And, I am not sure if you want to continue the project at all. If the latter,
and you stop, eventually it will just go into the way of entropy, and it will return to the old form. The major
work has been done, but it needs to be maintained. For it to get better results, it needs to have constant input
and supervision, and that means generating proper content, not just editing and grammatical fixes. Writers
need to know what to write. THe philanthrophy site is at the bottom of the page precisely because you have
not allowed us to add any content to it, and as a result it suffers.

You paid Mike $2500, which he applied for the purchasing of his replacement servers, but his fee of $7500

balance is now due if you want to continue. Please let me know what you want to do. I need to inform him,
and if you are not going to use him, he needs to take on his other clients and devote his time there.

This needs to be contrasted with what we started with, which was a search on your name, which had nine/10
very toxic prominent stories, and toxic Wiki article and headline.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013052.txt,"136 7 A Formal Model of Intelligent Agents

weight to a situation S based on the ease with which one agent in a society can communicate
S to another agent in that society, using multimodal communication (including verbalization,
demonstration, dramatic and pictorial depiction, etc.).

Finally, we present a formal measure of the “generality” of an intelligence, which precisiates
the informal distinction between “general AT’ and “narrow AI.”

7.3.1 Biased Universal Intelligence

To define universal intelligence, Legg and Hutter consider the class of environments that are
reward-summable, meaning that the total amount of reward they return to any agent is bounded
by 1. Where 7; denotes the reward experienced by the agent from the environment at time i,
the expected total reward for the agent 7 from the environment j: is defined as

Vr=B(S ori) <1
1

To extend their definition in the direction of greater realism, we first introduce a second-order
probability distribution v, which is a probability distribution over the space of environments
u. The distribution v assigns each environment a probability. One such distribution v is the
Solomonoff-Levin universal distribution in which one sets v = 2-*; but this is not the only
distribution v of interest. In fact a great deal of real-world general intelligence consists of the
adaptation of intelligent systems to particular distributions v over environment-space, differing
from the universal distribution.

We then define

Definition 4 The biased universal intelligence of an agent a is its expected performance
with respect to the distribution v over the space of all computable reward-summable environ-
ments, E, that is,

Y(m) = SO vr

pew

Legg and Hutter’s universal intelligence is obtained by setting v equal to the universal
distribution.

This framework is more flexible than it might seem. E.g. suppose one wants to incorporate
agents that die. Then one may create a special action, say agge, corresponding to the state of
death, to create agents that

e in certain circumstances output action ages
e have the property that if their previous action was ageg, then all of their subsequent actions
must be ages

and to define a reward structure so that actions aggg always bring zero reward. It then follows
that death is generally a bad thing if one wants to maximize intelligence. Agents that die will
not get rewarded after they’re dead; and agents that live only 70 years, say, will be restricted
from getting rewards involving long-term patterns and will hence have specific limits on their
intelligence.

FOR ALF

SSSEEESESELEEL

Palm Beach County Court

Epstein, in his Florida sex offender photo; at right, a phone message to Epstein from a modeling agent offering Russian lessons from a

“2x8” year old girl.

In 2006, that reputation caught up with him, when he was arrested by the Palm Beach Police on charges of sexually molesting
numerous underage girls. Police reports in the court record show that detectives found Epstein regularly paid very young women to
give him massages that he turned into sexual encounters. He allegedly had a preference for very young women, whom he carefully

groomed into increasingly extreme situations, including what some, including Roberts, allege to be sexual slavery.

In total, 40 women were identified as possible victims of sexual abuse by Epstein, many of them teenagers at the time, including some
younger than 14 years old. Epstein was originally charged with a variety of crimes, including sexual assault, rape, and witness

tampering.

He avoided most of those charges as well as federal prosecution in late 2007 by agreeing to plead guilty in Florida court, a deal that
Dershowitz, who was one of Epstein’s lawyers, helped negotiate along with an all-star legal lineup that interestingly also included

famed Clinton-hunter Ken Starr.

In the end, Epstein got 18 months in prison for a single count of soliciting an underage prostitute, of which he served 13 months. He is

now a registered sex offender who lists his primary residence as the U.S. Virgin Islands.

In a pleading late last month in federal court, attorneys for Roberts allege that “Dershowitz helped negotiate an agreement with a
provision that provided protection for himself against criminal prosecution.” Dershowitz has denied these charges vigorously, calling

them “salacious and false” and, possibly more importantly, “completely irrelevant” in a Jan. 12 filing.

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021738.txt,"“Are there more than one victim?” Circuit Court Judge Deborah Dale Pucillo asked
Belohlavek at the June 30, 2008 sentencing.

“There’s several,” Belohlavek replied.

“Are all the victims in both these cases in agreement with the terms of the plea?” the
judge asked.

“Yes,” Belohlavek said.

Coincidentally, the lawyer representing one of the victims was in the courtroom that
day. He told the Herald that neither he, nor his client, was told about the agreement.

Acosta has not responded to the Herald’s repeated requests for comment. A
spokesman at the Labor Department told the Washington Post last month: “The
office’s decisions were approved by departmental leadership and followed
departmental procedures.”

In the past, Acosta has said that he believed the deal was the best chance
prosecutors had of ensuring that Epstein spent some time behind bars and was
required to register as a sex offender. Epstein served 13 months in the Palm Beach
County jail — but he was allowed to leave for up to 12 hours a day as part of a work
release program not normally offered to convicted sex offenders.

Epstein’s victims, now in their late 20s and 30s, are fighting to have his deal
overturned and Epstein sent to prison.

Bradley Edwards, who represents several of Epstein’s victims, defended Villafana,
saying he believed that she was directed to settle the case and not inform Epstein’s
victims about the deal.

“In my conversations with her, I came to believe that she was in a difficult position.
She never came out and said this, but I suspected that someone above her directed
her to do what she did,” Edwards said.

° In 2008, you founded the Origins Project at Arizona State University in Tempe, a multidisciplinary effort
to understand the origins of the universe, life, and social systems. You have led that effort ever since.

e Thanks to best-selling books like The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe From Nothing, frequent
essays in publications including the New Yorker and the New York Times, and the documentary you made with
biologist Richard Dawkins, called The Unbelievers, you are celebrated as one of America’s leading public
intellectuals.

° You served on the science policy committee for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign and are a
vocal critic of President Donald Trump.

° You also make regular public appearances across the world, often at gatherings of skeptics and
atheists.

° At CSICon in Las Vegas in October, a few dozen fans paid $500 per head to attend a VIP luncheon
with you and Dawkins.

° Many more lined up to get you to sign their copy of your latest book, The Greatest Story Ever Told —
So Far.

° Online, people can buy T-shirts emblazoned “Lawrence Krauss for President.”

° In talks and interviews, you have argued that our universe arose without divine intervention, that

religion drives xenophobia, and that our brains are hardwired to believe.

° You have stated that science provides answers to many of life’s biggest questions, and can even fix
great societal injustices.

° Earlier this year, at a Q&A event to promote your new book, the conversation came around to the
dearth of women and minorities in science. “Science itself overcomes misogyny and prejudice and bias,” you
said. “It’s built in: Questioning yourself, always questioning results, questioning others, relying on empirical
evidence.”

° You have clashed with some skeptics over your defense of Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire financier who in
2008 was convicted for soliciting prostitution from underage girls, and spent 13 months in a Florida jail.

° Through his private foundation, Epstein has funded the work of several prominent scientists. He has
provided funding for your Origins Project, supporting lectureship and scholarship programs, most recently
pledging $100,000 in 2014.

° In April 2011, you told the Daily Beast: “As a scientist | always judge things on empirical evidence and
he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I’ve never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my
presumption is that whatever the problems were | would believe him over other people.”

° In a blog comment about the Epstein controversy, you wrote: “I remain skeptical, and | support a man
whose character | believe I know...If you want to condemn me for that, so be it.”

° You were made an honorary member of CFI’s board of directors in December 2011.

° A blog post published in August 2013 described incidents #1 and #4, naming you. Another post,

published at around the same time, described incident #5.

° The first post was edited to remove your name after you had commented that the allegations of assault
were “potentially illegal.” The second post was quickly taken down.

Again, if you wish to comment on or clarify any of these points, please get in touch with us as soon as possible.
If | do not respond immediately it is because | am on another call, so please leave the best phone number to

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010913.txt,"FOREWORD BY THE AUTHOR

How Come This Book?

A few months ago, Robert Trivers was kind enough to send me his new book. The
title is “Wild Life”. Perfect two ways. Bob is a world authority on wildlife, to wit
evolutionary biology. But his books and papers about that are already well known.

His new one is about his own wild life, with his ideas in the background.

I’ve started my own book three for four times over the past decade. Bob’s got me
started again. Try it. It’s Bob’s real voice. One of his papers, co-authored by Huey
Newton(!), is about deception and self-deception. I never saw much of either in Bob.
I] never saw a guy less anxious to impress. Fine if you knew his achievements, and
fine if you didn’t. What he wanted to talk about was great new ideas by others. It
was from him that I first heard about the Hamilton-Zuk parasite theory, and Paul
Ewald’s complementary one about parasites stabilizing population density of hosts.

Both are beautiful examples of the obvious-in-hindsight.

| realized that my book could take a cue from his. My own life hasn’t been wild. It
has been interesting because the genius of my father gave me interesting places to

be and things to do. I could say something about that.

But the book would be mostly about my ideas in economics. Bob’s ideas are well
known to anyone in his field. Mine aren't. I’m ten years older than Bob, without
much to show for it except in composition. (My last two operas have been getting
some traction, and my SACDs get pretty good radio time.) So I’ll run my economic
ideas up the flagpole, in my real voice, and see if they prove deception or self-

deception or something worth the time.

Declaring My Biases

I’m a big free market fan. | would love it even if | agreed with socialists that there is

something inherently iniquitous about it. There are bad guys and conflicted motives

money, and craves power and access.”

Bannon made an early-morning beeline to Epstein, even though Bannon may have
burned bridges when he savaged Ivanka Trump over her criticism of Roy Moore, whom
Bannon backed despite claims the candidate had sexually harassed teens. Citing an
allegation in -legal papers from a woman (who later dropped her lawsuit) that Donald
Trump and Epstein had raped her when she was 13, Bannon said in response to Ivanka,
“What about the allegations about her dad and that 13-year-old?”

Epstein has previously used his millions to cultivate the world’s most powerful — but has

mostly given money to Democrats.

From 2001 to 2003, Bill Clinton flew on Epstein’s private plane, dubbed “The Lolita
Express,” 26 times. Epstein is close to Prince Andrew and was a regular at Trump’s Mar-

a-Lago.

Trump told New York magazine of Epstein in 2002, “Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be
with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are

on the younger side.”

Epstein, 65, pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from a teen and served 13

months in jail.

Last year, he reportedly paid millions to settle three lawsuits filed against him by teens.
Bannon’s rep didn’t comment. A lawyer for Epstein said, “Let me ask him,” but didn’t

respond by deadline.

Seizing the Nuclear High Road with Little
to Lose

Even as he confronts a real bomb in North
Korea (very bad options there) and a
potential one in Iran (bad options there
too), Obama is trying to make good ona
longstanding commitment to reduce
America's own nuclear arsenal. Backed by
the military chiefs and likely by the public
too (getting rid of nukes equals saving
money), but opposed by Republicans in
Congress, Obama will try to work around
the political obstacles by seeking a deal
with yes ... you got it ... his old friend Vlad
Putin. It's worth a try. If Putin balks or
Republicans get in the way, the president
can always advocate unilateral cuts -- not
something he wants to do. But if he can't
have his way on nukes, he can always
blame it on the Russians and the
Republicans with little to lose. The road to
getting rid of nukes is a long one. Let the
next guy (or gal) worry about it.

A Little Leg on Palestine?

Obama hasn't mentioned the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict ina SOTU speech since
2009. And that's no coincidence. His own
poorly thought-through initial effort

Supplementary Education Market. For parents who continue to enroll their children in traditional public
and private schools, there is a growing demand for supplemental education services. According to the
U.S. Department of Education, 31% of elementary school children, or more than 10 million students
nationwide, are enrolled in after-school programs. According to Eduventures, the U.S. supplementary
education market was estimated to be approximately $8.1 billion in 2003. Additionally, under the No
Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act, some children in poorly performing schools will be eligible for taxpayer-
financed supplemental educational services. These supplemental educational services can be provided
by state-approved non-profit or for-profit entities as well as private schools and public schools (including
public charter schools). More parents want to spend educational time with their children, but lack access
to high quality supplemental material that is effective and integrated into a comprehensive plan that is
easy for a parent to deliver and manage.

The virtual school market is a relatively new area within the broader K-12 education market. As a result,
there is a growing need for a high quality, trusted, national education offering for this demographic.
Furthermore, parents are seeking much more robust and comprehensive ongoing assessments than is
currently offered in the public schools, in order to assess their children’s progress both on a relative and
an absolute basis.

8.5. The International Education Industry

The leading authority on the worldwide education industry, the United Nations Educational Scientific and
Cultural Organization (“UNESCO”), estimates that average public expenditures on education across the
world increased from 4.1% of GNP in 1990 to 4.5% in 2000. In developing countries the increased
government focus on education is more pronounced as public education expenditures rose to 4.1% in
2000 from 3.5% in 1990. Based on global gross national income of $48 trillion, KUE estimates that the
global education market opportunity is greater than $2.4 trillion driven by the following factors:

@ Large population of school-aged children in parts of the world. The opportunity for pre-K-12 education
is particularly strong in certain countries with high fertility rates. Examples of such opportunities

include India, where mothers give birth to an average of 2.78 children. Increases in the population of
children coupled with an increased awareness of the economic and social benefits of education are
expected to lead to significant growth in the global ECE market.

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024221.txt,"Global Utility White Paper CONFIDENTIAL

Appendix 1: The Team and Our Process
e Electron Focus

Electron’s universe of utility and infrastructure stocks is deep, comprising 375 companies with a market
cap of $2.8 trillion. Stocks covered include the electric, gas, water and waste utilities in addition to
infrastructure companies (defined as those levered to utilities or utility-like). Our approach is truly global
as 40-60% of the portfolio’s historical gross has been allocated outside the US.

e Electron Team

Electron’s cohesive, long-standing team consists of 8 members, including 5 investment professionals who
have worked (with Jos Shaver as Portfolio Manager) at SAC Capital and the original Electron Capital for an
average of 6 years. In addition, 4 of the 5 investment professionals have lived outside the US, a distinct
competitive advantage given our global approach. Each investment professional brings his/her own
specific expertise and diligent research to our process, working collaboratively across regions to conduct
deep-dive research on the most compelling opportunities in the global utility sector.

The other members of Electron complement the skills and experience of the investment team. Electron’s
experienced operations/investor relations professionals are former Intrepid Capital employees who
worked with the Electron team during the first iteration of Electron (2005-2008) when the firm had a
services agreement with Intrepid Capital.

Finally, a Senior Advisory Board consisting of former C-level utility executives from around the globe has
been with the team since the launch of the original Electron Capital in 2005, and all have rejoined for
Electron’s re-launch.

As Portfolio Manager, Jos Shaver has covered the global utility and infrastructure sectors for the past 21
years, and his sector perspective benefits from his having lived 10 years abroad (5 years in Asia covering
the Asian utilities and 5 years in Europe covering European utilities) and 11 years in the US. In addition, as
Managing Partner, Jos controls all major decisions at Electron.

e Track Record (7 years)

Electron’s 7-year track record (3 years audited from the original Electron and 4 years from SAC Capital)
has annualized 10.3% since inception and has been characterized by strong alpha generation on both the
long and short side (80% of returns, based on Jensen’s alpha calculation). Electron generated this 7-year
track record during an exceptionally challenging period for global utilities — the MSCI World Utility Index
has been the worst-performing MSCI Global Sector ex-financials over the track record period, down -0.2%.
Notwithstanding, Electron’s track record has bested the MSCI World Utility, S&P 500 and HFRI indices by
91%, 67% and 61%, respectively.

e Process

First, given Electron’s global approach to utility research, we tend to have a clear competitive advantage
with respect to early recognition of cross-border structural change (e.g., how a change in Asian seaborne
coal market might affect off-peak power prices and thus earnings for a Midwest US utility). Moreover,
our global research approach allows us to gain perspective on structural change outcomes given our
knowledge of global precedents and the likely reaction from various interested parties (e.g., governments,
regulators, managements, customers, consumer groups, rating agencies, shareholders, debt holders, et
al.) We analyze other global precedents, develop a thesis and then conduct deep-dive research to gain
conviction. Once we have developed a structural change thesis, we proceed to a full bottoms-up analysis

This brainlike neural network was produced by the long history of civilization, whereas
the cellular automaton was created by my computer in the last microsecond.

The problem of abstract AI is similar to the problem of recognizing
extraterrestrial intelligence: How do you determine whether or not it has a purpose? This
is a question I don’t consider answered. We’ll say things like, “Well, AI will be
intelligent when it can do blah-blah-blah. ” When it can find primes. When it can
produce this and that and the other. But there are many other ways to get to those results.
Again, there is no bright line between intelligence and mere computation.

It’s another part of the Copernican story: We used to think Earth was the center of
the universe. Now we think we’re special because we have intelligence and nothing else
does. I’m afraid the bad news is that that isn’t a distinction.

Here’s one of my scenarios. Let’s say there comes a time when human
consciousness 1s readily uploadable into digital form, virtualized and so on, and pretty
soon we have a box of a trillion souls. There are a trillion souls in the box, all virtualized.
In the box, there will be molecular computing going on—maybe derived from biology,
maybe not. But the box will be doing all kinds of elaborate stuff. And there’s a rock
sitting next to the box. Inside a rock, there are always all kinds of elaborate stuff going
on, all kinds of subatomic particles doing all kinds of things. What’s the difference
between the rock and the box of a trillion souls? The answer is that the details of what’s
happening in the box were derived from the long history of human civilization, including
whatever people watched on YouTube the day before. Whereas the rock has its long
geological history but not the particular history of our civilization.

Realizing that there isn’t a genuine distinction between intelligence and mere
computation leads you to imagine that future—the endpoint of our civilization as a box of
trillion souls, each of them essentially playing a video game, forever. What is the
“purpose” of that?

Epstein might have just been hit with solicitation
charges and paid a fine even though some of the girls
were underage; prostitution charges in Florida (as in
most places) have no age limits and the Palm Beach
grand jury proposed solely a solicitation charge. But
Epstein’s flamboyance and his friendship with Clinton
invited the scrutiny of the Bush FBI, and ultimately
Epstein and his legal team decided to go for a plea deal.
The result was a baroque set of agreements with both
the Feds and Palm Beach county, which mandated jail
time (Epstein was sentenced to 18 months, of which he
served 13—nearly all Florida prisoners serve only 70%
of their officially sentenced time) and sex offender

U.S. Hones Warnings to Egypt as
Military Stalls Transition

David D. Kirkpatrick and Steven Lee Myers

November 16, 2011 -- CAIRO — Brazen attempts by Egypt’s interim
military rulers to hold on to power long after elections have elicited a
sharp reaction domestically and for the first time have prompted
Washington to warn about the potential for new unrest.

After months of mixing gentle pressure with broad support for the
ruling military council, the Obama administration has sharpened its
tone, senior administration officials say, expressing concern that the
failure to move to civilian control could undermine the defining
revolt of the Arab Spring.

The shift in tone is part of a difficult balancing act for Washington,
which is keen to preserve its ties to the military and its interests in the
region, chiefly Egypt’s role in maintaining peace with Israel. But
Washington also hopes to win favor with Egypt’s newly empowered
political opposition while avoiding the appearance of endorsing the
military’s stalled transition to democracy. All things considered,
some here have suggested, the change in tone may be intended to
placate Egyptian public opinion rather than actually press the military
to give up power.

“T think they are working for their own interests, particularly
regarding the slow transition of power,” said Shady el-Ghazaly Harb,
a prominent liberal activist who was among the leaders of the
Egyptian revolution. “The U.S. wants to guarantee that the coming
government will be on good terms — I won’t say loyal, but friendly —

Getting back to my invitation to President Clinton to attend Rosh Hashanah services, this was not
the first such invitation I had extended to a head of state. In 1990, I had invited Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev to join me at Rosh Hashanah services in Moscow, where I had been invited to
the Kremlin to speak at a conference on law and bilateral economic relations in September of
1990. It was a time of transition, but the Soviet Union was still in existence and Gorbachev was
still running it.

Gorbachev attended the closing dinner, having just come from an emotional meeting of the
Supreme Soviet at which he had sought emergency powers to confront the ongoing crisis. I
introduced myself to him as he was eating dinner and we had a lengthy conversation in which I
asked him to come with me to the synagogue and denounce anti-Semitism as Pope Paul had done
when he appeared at the Rome Synagogue and deplored “the hatred, persecutions, and displays of
anti-Semitism directed against the Jews at any time and by anyone.”

Gorbachev smiled and asked me rhetorically, “Are you here to help bring down my government
?” He said he could not go to the synagogue but he promised me that he would condemn anti-
Semitism. Shortly thereafter, he announced that “the Democratic Russian public denounces anti-
Semitism and will do everything in its power to uproot the phenomenon from our society.”

In 2008, I met Gorbachev again. This time, under the most unusual of circumstances. He was in
Israel at the invitation of President Shimon Peres to help celebrate Israel’s 60 birthday. I was
there for the same reason. I had just appeared on a panel with Vaclav Havel and with Natan
Sharansky, both of whom who had been imprisoned by Communist regimes, and both of whose
cases I had worked on as a defense attorney. After the completion of the panel, in a remarkable
turn of fate, the four of us ended up in the same elevator. (Sounds like the beginning of a bad
joke: Gorbachev, Havel, Sharansky and Dershowitz meet in an elevator in Jerusalem...)
Gorbachev recognized the three of us and turning to me said, “You’re the big shot lawyer for all
the dissidents.” I extended my hand to him and reminded him of our meeting in Moscow. He
then turned to Havel and Sharansky and said, “He may be a good lawyer but it was I who got you
out of prison.” I smiled and replied, “It’s always more important to have a good judge than a
good lawyer.” Sharanky turned to Gorbachev and said, “Why didn’t you let us out sooner?” to
which Gorbachev responded, “You overrate my power.” We all had a good laugh.

He was also not above entering into risky, tax-sheltered oil and gas deals with much smaller
investors. A lawsuit that Michael Stroll, the former head of Williams Electronics Inc., filed
against Epstein shows that in 1982 I.A.G. received an investment from Stroll of $450,000, which
Epstein put into oil. In 1984 Stroll asked for his money back; four years later he had received
only $10,000. Stroll lost the suit, after Epstein claimed in court, among other things, that the
check for $10,000 was for a horse he’d bought from Stroll. “My net worth never exceeded four
and a half million dollars,” Stroll has said.

Hoffenberg, says a close friend, “really liked Jeffrey.... Jeffrey has a way of getting under your
skin, and he was under Hoffenberg’s.” Also appealing to Hoffenberg were Epstein’s social
connections; they included oil mogul Cece Wang (father of the designer Vera) and Mohan
Murjani, whose clothing company grew into Gloria Vanderbilt Jeans. Epstein lived large even
then. One friend recalls that when he took Canadian heiress Wendy Belzberg on a date he hired a
Rolls-Royce especially for the occasion. (Epstein has claimed he owned it.)

In 1987, Hoffenberg, according to sources, set Epstein up in the offices he still occupies in the
Villard House, on Madison Avenue, across a courtyard from the restaurant Le Cirque.
Hoffenberg hired his new protégé as a consultant at $25,000 a month, and the relationship
flourished. “They traveled everywhere together—on Hoffenberg’s plane, all around the world,
they were always together,” says a source. Hoffenberg has claimed that Epstein confided in him,
saying, for example, that he had left Bear Stearns in 1981 after he was discovered executing
“illegal operations.”

Several of Epstein’s Bear Stearns contemporaries recall that Epstein left the company very
suddenly. Within the company there were rumors also that he was involved in a technical
infringement, and it was thought that the executive committee asked that he resign after his two
supporters, Ace Greenberg and Jimmy Cayne, were outnumbered. Greenberg says he can’t recall
this; Cayne denies it happened, and Epstein has denied it as well. “Jeffrey Epstein left Bear
Stearns of his own volition,” says Cayne. “It was never suggested that he leave by any member
of management, and management never looked into any improprieties by him. Jeffrey said
specifically, ‘I don’t want to work for anybody else. I want to work for myself.’” Yet, this is not
the story that Epstein told to the S.E.C. in 1981 and to lawyers in a 1989 deposition involving a
civil business case in Philadelphia.

In 1981 the S.E.C.’s Jonathan Harris and Robert Blackburn took Epstein’s testimony and that of
other Bear Stearns employees in part of what became a protracted case about insider trading
around a tender offer placed on March 11, 1981, by the Seagram Company Ltd. for St. Joe
Minerals Corp. Ultimately several Italian and Swiss investors were found guilty, including
Italian financier Giuseppe Tome, who had used his relationship with Seagram owner Edgar
Bronfman Sr. to obtain information about the tender offer.

After the tender offer was announced, the S.E.C. began investigating trades involving St. Joe at
Bear Stearns and other firms. Epstein resigned from Bear Stearns on March 12. The S.E.C. was
tipped off that Epstein had information on insider trading at Bear Stearns, and it was therefore
obliged to question him. In his S.E.C. testimony, given on April 1, 1981, Epstein claimed that he
had found “offensive” the way Bear Stearns management had handled a disciplinary action

From day zero I proposed to discount to 50 - 60 million the fair price of the transaction just completed .
including Phaidon. . though this amount was already substantially less than our agreed and negotiated
formula.- Iwas never told that this was out of range. in fact, alternative methods of payment .

till March ) ,I provided as you specifically requested a detailed step by step execution plan and reviewed
all documents that i was given access to. ( Phaidon was not forthcoming ) in order to make my many

whether brad even knew of our prior agreement.? I called him and he said he was never told.?, I would
ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it would be helpful. . I would like to send him this

“The alleged victim in this case says she was forced by DSK to give him oral sex. His
defense counsel have argued in the press, and in their briefs and in their opining statements
that the oral sex was entirely consensual.

In deciding which version is true and which false, I want you to accept the fact that the
alleged victim has told many lies in the past and can’t be completely trusted. In other
words, if there were no other evidence or arguments beyond the uncorroborated word of
the victim, there would be a reasonable doubt of DSK’s guilt. But the totality of the
evidence and arguments in this case establish that it is far more likely that the oral sex in
this case was forced rather than consensual.

First, I want you to look at the participants. She is an attractive young woman who was
wearing two pair of pantyhose and an additional undergarment. The defendant’s DNA
was found on the elastic of her undergarments, strongly suggesting that he was trying to
pull them off.

You have seen the naked photograph taken of the defendant following his arrest, when he
was examined by doctors for bruises. Look at that photograph and imagine what the
alleged victim in this case saw, when DSK walked out of the shower and into the bedroom
naked, as his lawyers acknowledge he did.

In order to accept the defense theory of consensual oral sex, this is what you have to
believe.

The alleged victim looked at this overweight, out of shape, 6 __ year old man and decided,
without any words spoken, that she was so sexually attracted to him, that she simply had
to give him seven minutes of oral gratification in the corner of the bedroom. What was in
it for her? According to the defense theory, only the sexual pleasure of giving a short, fat,
old man oral sex.

That, in essence, is the defense lawyers’ version of what took place. Now, we all know
that the burden of proof is on the prosecution to prove our case beyond a reasonable
doubt, and that the defendant need not take the witness stand nor offer any proof of
innocence. But in this case, the defendant, because he is a public figure, has put forward a
defense—actually two defenses—though his lawyers in the courtroom and in the court of
public opinion. The first—that he wasn’t even there at the time because he was lunching
with his daughter—has been withdrawn. His current defense—his theory of
innocence—is that she wanted to give him oral sex, that it was entirely consensual. If you
believe that—or even if you have a reasonable believe that she might have offered him oral
sex because she was so attracted to him—you should acquit. But if you believe, beyond a
reasonable doubt, that the defense theory of consensual oral sex is utterly implausible, then
you should look at the totality of the evidence corroborating the alleged victim’s
account—that he forced her to give him oral sex—and decide whether it establishes
beyond a reasonable doubt that her account is true.

a useful but dangerous diagnostic tool for educators. One of the worst

bit like the initial option for the Rue Verdun raid Dado had rejected: a classic
ground assault which, in addition to eliminating any chance of surprise,
obviously ran the risk of igniting a small ground war. But I did think that some
combination of Peled’s idea and the surprise commando strike we’d been
looking at might provide an answer.

A few hours later, the hostages’ ordeal took a chilling turn, which soon also
provided us with our first real detailed picture of the scale of the challenge we
faced. In a haunting echo of the Nazis’ “selection” process in the Holocaust, the
terrorists separated all the passengers with Israeli passports or Jewish names.
They let the rest of them go, and allowed them to board a special Air France
flight back to Paris. We immediately dispatched Amiram Levin to debrief the
freed passengers. On a scrambled teleprinter line Wednesday night, Amiram
came up with far more than we could have hoped for. One of released
passengers was a French woman who had managed to hide the fact she was
Jewish. She confirmed reports we had been getting that the hostages were being
held in the airport’s former terminal building, about a mile from its newer
terminal and the main runways. Other passengers revealed that the hijackers had
placed explosives around the old terminal building. And that, despite my hope
that Idi Amin would stand aside if we did decide to go in and rescue the
hostages, his troops were helping to guard the area.

So in addition to taking on the hijackers, we’d have to find a way to deal
with Ugandan soldiers. In another round of discussions in my office through the
late hours of Wednesday night, we finally settled on our plan: Peled’s major
airborne operation, but with a Sayeret Matkal strike force, with its “Ugandan”
motorcade, spearheading it. Minutes later, three other C-130s would fly in
additional troops to secure the rest of the airport, deal with any Ugandan army
resistance, and fly out the Israeli soldiers and the hostages.

An operation on that scale naturally meant bringing in Dan Shomron. After
I’d taken the plan to Kuti Adam, he briefed Dan on the full detail and called me
down to see him again. Dan had left to start preparations for the operation. He’d
made just one request, Kuti said: that I be in command of the sayeret force.

Accountable Care Organization (ACO) -
A health system model with the ability to
provide, and manage with patients, the
continuum of care across different
institutional settings, including at least
ambulatory (outpatient) and inpatient
hospital care and possibly post acute care.
ACOs have the capability of planning
budgets and resources and are of sufficient
size to support comprehensive, valid, and
reliable performance measurement. The
ACO model is one of the latest designs for
managing healthcare costs and especially
Medicare costs, and is gaining traction
among policymakers desperate to control
costs and boost quality in healthcare.

Accrual accounting - A system of
accounting in which revenues are recorded
when they are earned and outlays are
recorded when goods are received or
services are performed, even though the
actual receipt of revenues and payment for
goods or services may occur, in whole or in
part, at a different time. Compare with cash
accounting.

Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) - All income
that is subject to taxation under the
individual income tax after above-the-line
deductions for such things as alimony
payments and certain contributions to
individual retirement accounts. Personal
exemptions and the standard or itemized
deductions are subtracted from AGI to
determine taxable income

Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) - A tax
intended to limit the extent to which higher-
income people can reduce their tax liability
(the amount they owe) through the use of
preferences in the tax code. Taxpayers
subject to the AMT are required to
recalculate their tax liability on the basis of a
more limited set of exemptions, deductions,
and tax credits than would normally apply.
The amount by which a taxpayer’s AMT
calculation exceeds his or her regular tax
calculation is that person’s AMT liability.

Act of 2009 (ARRA) - This act provided
appropriations for several federal programs
and increased or extended some benefits
payable under Medicaid, unemployment
compensation, and nutrition assistance,
among others. ARRA also reduced
individual and corporate income taxes and
made other changes to tax laws.

Asset-Backed Security - Security backed
by real estate or another type of asset; a
claim on an income flow, such as expected
interest payments on loans, payments on
leases, royalty payments, or receivables; a
claim on the principal of a loan; or a claim on
the expected appreciation of an asset.

Automatic Stabilizers - Taxes that
decrease and expenditures that increase
when the economy goes into a recession
(and vice-versa when the economy booms)
without requiring any action on the part of
the government. Stabilizers tend to reduce
the depth of recessions and dampen booms.

interstate communication in connection with sex offenses and traveling in
interstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct
with minors.'°’ The local police provided the FBI with information, which
the FBI then investigated. Following an investigation, the FBI determined
that the allegations of abuse against Epstein were credible, and it presented
the case to the U.S. Attomey’s Office for the Southern District of Florida.
In 2007, the Office contacted counsel for Jeffrey Epstein and began
negotiating a resolution of the case against him.'”°

Under our proposed test, the victims would not have had CVRA rights
the first moment that the FBI became aware of Epstein’s possible
commission of sex offenses. But after the FBI developed substantial
evidence of those sex offenses, identified victims of those offenses, and
presented the case to the appropriate U.S. Attorney’s Office for prosecution,
CVRA rights would have attached. Accordingly, the FBI would have been
required to notify the identified victims of their rights under the CVRA (as
well as under the VRRA). From that point forward in the case, the victims
would have had CVRA rights, such as the right to fair treatment and the
right to confer with prosecutors. In this case, the victims would have had
the right to confer with prosecutors about the nonprosecution agreement
that they ultimately reached with Epstein.’

C. CURRENT DEPARTMENT POLICY ON PRE-CHARGING RIGHTS

One objection that might be made to the formulation offered above is
that it might unduly burden federal law enforcement officers and
prosecutors, who would need to make judgment calls about when an
investigation has coalesced to the point where “victims” are in existence,
“substantial evidence” has been collected, and notice of rights has to be
provided. Any such objection would be ill-founded, though, as it does not
appear that implementing such an approach would be difficult.*”
Presumably the Justice Department has already been providing such rights
in at least Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi to comply with the Fifth

197 See 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422(b), 2423(b), (e) (2012).

198 A more substantial summary of the case is available in case filings. See Jane Doe
Motion, supra note 40.

199 See supra Part II.

200 This Article does not discuss mass victim cases in which notice needs to be provided
to hundreds of victims. But in such situations, the CVRA already provides for “reasonable”
alternative procedures. 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)\(2) (2012). The Department of Justice, for
example, has used websites to provide notice in terrorism cases to large numbers of victims.

Pelton debriefings. The debriefing sessions, which went on for fifteen
days, were from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. In them, Pelton managed to
recall Project A, a joint NSA-CIA-navy operation in which subma-
rines surreptitiously tapped into Soviet undersea cables in the Sea
of Okhotsk, which connected to the Soviet Pacific Fleet’s mainland
headquarters at Vladivostok. Pelton received another $30,000 from
the KGB.

“Did the information in his head prove valuable?” I asked.

“As long as the NSA didn’t know the tap was compromised by
Pelton, we could use the cable to send the NSA the information we
wanted it to intercept.” He said that while actual NSA documents
would have proved more useful than someone’s memories, “Our job
is to take advantage of whatever we can get.”

Two years later, Pelton was again flown to Vienna for another
debriefing to see if he could recall any further details. According to
Cherkashin, the KGB’s job was to leave no stone unturned when
it came to the NSA’s sources. In 1985, the KGB’s task ended when
Pelton was arrested by the FBI. Like Ames and Hanssen, Pelton was

© sentenced to life imprisonment. ©

Looking at his watch, Cherkashin politely excused himself.

I subsequently spoke to Colonel Oleg Nechiporenko, who had
been a foreign intelligence officer in the KGB between 1958 and
1985 and continued his intelligence work until recently as chief
counterterrorism expert of the Russian-led Collective Security
Treaty Organization. Over a leisurely coffee in the bar of the Hotel
National, he told me that many “walk-ins” who contacted Soviet
officials in his time were emotionally disturbed, but all of them had
to be assessed for possible intelligence value. “Our job was to find
espionage sources,” he said with a twinkle in his eye. “The Internet
has changed the espionage business since secret documents can be
massively downloaded by an unhappy employee,” he said, “but they
still need to be assessed by a professional.”

Through the eyes of the KGB, a penetration of American intel-
ligence was clearly opportunistic. If these practices continued, they
put Snowden’s situation in a new light for me. If Russian intelli-
gence considered it worthwhile to send a former civilian worker at
the NSA, such as Ronald Pelton, two thousand miles from Washing-

he Jarvanka side of the White House increasingly felt that rumors leaked by Bannon
| and his allies were undermining them. Jared and Ivanka, ever eager to enhance their
status as the adults in the room, felt personally wounded by these backdoor attacks.
Kushner, in fact, now believed Bannon would do anything to destroy them. This was
personal. After months of defending Bannon against liberal media innuendo, Kushner had
concluded that Bannon was an anti-Semite. That was the bottom-line issue. This was a
complicated and frustrating business—and quite hard to communicate to his father-in-law
—hbecause one of Bannon’s accusations against Kushner, the administration’s point person
on the Middle East, was that he was not nearly tough enough in his defense of Israel.

After the election, the Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson with sly jocularity privately
pointed out to the president that by offhandedly giving the Israel portfolio to his son-in-
law—who would, Trump said, make peace in the Middle East—he hadn’t really done
Kushner any favors.

“IT know,” replied Trump, quite enjoying the joke.

Jews and Israel were a curious Trump subtext. Trump’s brutish father was an often
vocal anti-Semite. In the split in New York real estate between the Jews and non-Jews, the
Trumps were clearly on the lesser side. The Jews were white shoe, and Donald Trump,
even more than his father, was perceived as a vulgarian—after all, he put his name on his
buildings, quite a déclassé thing to do. (Ironically, this proved to be a significant advance
in real estate marketing and, arguably, Trump’s greatest accomplishment as a developer—
branding buildings.) But Trump had grown up and built his business in New York, the
world’s largest Jewish city. He had made his reputation in the media, that most Jewish of
industries, with some keen understanding of media tribal dynamics. His mentor, Roy
Cohn, was a demimonde, semiunderworld, tough-guy Jew. He courted other figures he
considered “tough-guy Jews” (one of his accolades): Carl Icahn, the billionaire hedge
funder; Ike Perlmutter, the billionaire investor who had bought and sold Marvel Comics;
Ronald Perelman, the billionaire Revlon chairman; Steven Roth, the New York billionaire
real estate tycoon; and Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate. Trump had

crime victims to assert CVRA rights “in the district court in which a
defendant is being prosecuted for the crime or, if no prosecution is
underway, in the district court in the district in which the crime
occurred.”'® The Department contends that this language refers quite
narrowly to the “period of time between the filing of a complaint and the
initiation of formal charges.”'®° In support of its position, the Department
cites a Fourth Circuit case interpreting the Sixth Amendment right to
counsel, which held that a “prosecution” for purposes of that Amendment
does not begin when a criminal complaint is filed.'!°? In OLC’s view, the
venue provision’s direction that victims should assert nghts when “no
prosecution is underway” applies only to the limited time between when the
Government files a complaint against a defendant and some later point
when the “prosecution” actually begins. OLC notes that the filing of a
complaint triggers an initial appearance, where crime victims can have
important interests at stake, such as the right to be heard about a
defendant’s release on bail. OLC believes it is only to such post-complaint,
yet pre-indictment, proceedings (i.c., the initial appearance) that the venue
provision’s “no-prosecution-underway” language covers.

As a preliminary matter, OLC’s interpretation of the word
“prosecution” in the Department’s narrow construction of the venue
provision is a twisted one, at odds with the way that term is conventionally
used. The filing of a complaint is typically viewed as the start of a criminal
prosecution. For example, the leading criminal procedure hombook states
that “[wlith the filing of the complaint, the arrestee officially becomes a
‘defendant’ in a criminal prosecution.

Moreover, having specifically rejected the filing of the criminal
complaint as the starting point for a “prosecution” within the CVRA’s
venue provision, OLC refuses to consider the implications of its alterative
starting point: the formal filing of an indictment. OLC states that “a
prosecution of a felony must commence with the retum of an indictment by
a grand jury,” citing the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.’ Yet OLC
does not pause to recognize that, while felonies proceed by way of
indictment, misdemeanors can proceed not only by indictment but also by
complaint.'” The CVRA draws no distinction between misdemeanor and

dynamical state to another (1997). This suggests that meaningful tension between
experimental sample lengths long enough to minimize statistical error and short
enough to be stationary may be, for the biological sciences, more apparent than

relevant.

The studies reviewed below exploit measures arising from the view that the
noisy statistics of nonstationarity in biological processes are not a sign of
measurement error, but rather evidence consonant with the statistical physics of
nonequilibrium states and phase transitions (Stanley, 1971; Stauffer, 1985;
Yeomans, 1993). Very high amplitude fluctuations and multiple, up to infinite,
correlation lengths are characteristic of the normal, on-going biological dynamical
behaviors, which are apparently without characteristic amplitude and time scales.
From this point of view, if most or all information is widely distributed in the brain
(e.g., serial order of visual tasks involving motor cortical neurons, Carpenter et al,
1999) ) then the “binding problem” (see above) could also be solved by multiple, up
to infinite spatial and temporal correlation lengths in place of the current theories of
monofrequency resonances (Singer, 1993). Hierarchical neurodynamical
mechanisms communicating across many mechanistic temporal and spatial scales,
brain information transport analogous to the energy cascade of hydrodynamic
turbulent velocities (Tennekes and Lumley, 1972), would be likely in the parametric

vicinity of incipient bifurcations and phase transitions.

Three closely related techniques for quantifying the systematic changes in
average fluctuation amplitudes with n (scale, sample length) involve a “power law,”
linear slope relationship between the logarithm of an index of variability and the
logarithm of sample segment sizes. These easy, yet powerful methods were
brought to experimentalists’ attention by Benoit Mandelbrot (Montroll and Badger,
1974; Mandelbrot, 1983; Fedor, 1988; Bassingthwaighte et al, 1994; Liebovitch,
1998). To estimate the exponent in Hurst rescaled range analysis, we compute the
standard deviation and the range of the deviation of the running sum from the mean
on sequential subsamples of increasing size. The Hurst power law exponent is the

slope of the straight line formed by graphing the logarithm of the subsample length

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016239.txt,"But Wiener failed to foresee crucial technological developments. Like pretty
much all technologists of the 1950s, he failed to predict the computer revolution.
Computers, he thought, would eventually fall in price from hundreds of thousands of
(1950s) dollars to tens of thousands; neither he nor his compeers anticipated the
tremendous explosion of computer power that would follow the development of the
transistor and the integrated circuit. Finally, because of his emphasis on control, Wiener
could not foresee a technological world in which innovation and self-organization bubble
up from the bottom rather than being imposed from the top.

Focusing on the evils of totalitarianism (political, scientific, and religious),
Wiener saw the world in a deeply pessimistic light. His book warned of the catastrophe
that awaited us if we didn’t mend our ways, fast. The current world of human beings and
machines, more than a half century after its publication, is much more complex, richer,
and contains a much wider variety of political, social, and scientific systems than he was
able to envisage. The warnings of what will happen if we get it wrong, however—for
example, control of the entire Internet by a global totalitarian regime—remain as relevant
and pressing today as they were in 1950.

What Wiener Got Right

Wiener’s most famous mathematical works focused on problems of signal analysis and
the effects of noise. During World War II, he developed techniques for aiming anti-
aircraft fire by making models that could predict the future trajectory of an airplane by
extrapolating from its past behavior. In Cybernetics and in The Human Use of Human
Beings, Wiener notes that this past behavior includes quirks and habits of the human
pilot, thus a mechanized device can predict the behavior of humans. Like Alan Turing,
whose Turing Test suggested that computing machines could give responses to questions
which were indistinguishable from human responses, Wiener was fascinated by the
notion of capturing human behavior by mathematical description. In the 1940s, he
applied his knowledge of control and feedback loops to neuro-muscular feedback in
living systems, and was responsible for bringing Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts to
MIT, where they did their pioneering work on artificial neural networks.

Wiener’s central insight was that the world should be understood in terms of
information. Complex systems, such as organisms, brains, and human societies, consist
of interlocking feedback loops in which signals exchanged between subsystems result in
complex but stable behavior. When feedback loops break down, the system goes
unstable. He constructed a compelling picture of how complex biological systems
function, a picture that is by and large universally accepted today.

Wiener’s vision of information as the central quantity in governing the behavior
of complex systems was remarkable at the time. Nowadays, when cars and refrigerators
are jammed with microprocessors and much of human society revolves around computers
and cell phones connected by the Internet, it seems prosaic to emphasize the centrality of
information, computation, and communication. In Wiener’s time, however, the first
digital computers had only just come into existence, and the Internet was not even a
twinkle in the technologist’s eye.

Wiener’s powerful conception of not just engineered complex systems but all
complex systems as revolving around cycles of signals and computation led to
tremendous contributions to the development of complex human-made systems. The

http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey-epstein-200303

Much of Epstein’s work 1s related to cleaning up, tightening budgets, and efficiencies. One
person who worked for Wexner and who saw a contract drawn up between the two men says
Epstein is involved in “everything, not just a little here, a little there. Everything!” In addition, he
says, “Wexner likes having a hatchet man.... Whenever there is dirty work to be done he’d stick
Jeffrey on it.... He has a reputation for being ruthless but he gets the job done.”

Epstein has evidently been asked to fire personal-staff members when needed. “He was that
mysterious person that everyone was scared to death of,” says a former employee.

Meanwhile, he is also less than popular with some people outside Wexner’s company with
whom he now deals. “He ‘inserted’ himself into the construction process of Leslie Wexner’s
yacht.... That resulted in litigation down the road between Mr. Wexner and the shipyard that
eventually built the vessel,” says Lars Forsberg, a lawyer whose firm at the time, Dickerson and
Reily, was hired to deal with litigation stemming from the construction of Wexner’s Limitless—
at 315 feet, one of the largest private yachts in the world. Evidently, Epstein stalled on paying
Dickerson and Reily for its work. “It’s probably once or twice in my legal career that I’ve had to
sue a client for payment of services that he’d requested and we’d performed ... without issue on
the performance,” says Forsberg. In the end the matter was settled, but Epstein claims he now
has no recollection of it.

The incident is one of a number of disputes Epstein has become embroiled in. Some are for sums
so tiny as to be baffling; for instance, Epstein sued investment adviser Herbert Glass, who sold
him the Palm Beach house in 1990, for $13,444—Epstein claimed this was owed him for
furnishings removed by Glass.

In 1998 the U.S. Attorney’s Office sued Epstein for illegally subletting the former home of the
deputy consul general of Iran to attorney Ivan Fisher and others. Epstein paid $15,000 a month in
rent to the State Department, but he charged Fisher and his colleagues $20,000. Though the exact
terms of the agreement are sealed, the court ruled against Epstein.

Wexner offers some insight into his friend’s combative style. “Many times people confuse
winning and losing,” Wexner says. “Jeffrey has the unusual quality of knowing when he is
winning. Whether in conversations or negotiations, he always stands back and lets the other
person determine the style and manner of the conversation or negotiation. And then he responds
in their style. Jeffrey sees it in chivalrous terms. He does not pick a fight, but if there is a fight,
he will let you choose your weapon.”

One case is rather more serious. Currently, Citibank is suing Epstein for defaulting on loans from
its private-banking arm for $20 million. Epstein claims that Citibank “fraudulently induced” him
into borrowing the money for investments. Citibank disputes this charge.

The legal papers for another case offer a rare window into Epstein’s finances. In 1995, Epstein
stopped paying rent to his landlord, the nonprofit Municipal Arts Society, for his office in the
Villard House. He claimed that they were breaking the terms of the lease by not letting his staff
in at night. The case was eventually settled. However, one of the papers filed in this dispute 1s
Epstein’s financial statement for 1988, in which he claimed to be worth $20 million. He listed

the transcript. After agreeing to do the appeal, I decided to start from scratch with a new
investigation. My goal was to secure a new trial for the ex heavyweight champ.

I assembled a superb team, which included my brother Nathan, my son Jamin, who had just
completed a two year stint with the New York Legal Aid Society following his graduation from
Yale Law School and a clerkship with the Chief Judge of the Federal District Court in
Massachusetts. It also included my co-clerk for Justice Goldberg, who was a leading Indiana

lawyer.

On the basis of our investigation and the new evidence we uncovered, I was convinced that Mike
Tyson did not intend to rape Desiree Washington, and that he got a bum rap.

Several of the jurors agreed with me after learning of some of the new evidence. One of them
said: We [the jurors] felt that a man raped a woman... In hindsight, it [now] looks like a woman
raped a man.

Another juror told the media that Desiree Washington, the pageant contestant who accused Tyson
of raping her, has committed a crime.

In order to understand why these jurors had such dramatic second thoughts about their verdict,
we must go back to the trial itself and see how Desiree Washington, the alleged victim, was
portrayed to the jury. During the trial she did not even allow her name or face to be revealed. She
was presented as a shy, young, inexperienced, religious schoolgirl, who wanted nothing more than
to put this whole unpleasant tragedy behind her.

Her family said they had hired a lawyer for the express purpose of helping to ward off the
media, because she did not want any publicity. She said she had no plans to sue Tyson and she
had certainly not hired a lawyer for that purpose. When she and her family were asked whether
they had a contingency fee agreement with any lawyer -- the kind of agreement traditionally
made with lawyers who are contemplating a money suit for damages -- they all claimed not even
to know what that term meant. When Desiree's mother was asked whether there had ever been
any discussions with lawyers about fees, she said no, and she swore under oath that there were

Thus, as one of the jurors later put it: When she [Washington] said she wasn't looking to get any
money, I believed her and thought then that we made the right decision. Another juror agreed,
saying that at the trial, she was very, very credible, because she had no motive to lie, since she
was not intending to collect any money, or to benefit in any way from Tyson's conviction.

Desiree Washington also pretended -- with the complicity of the prosecutor -- that she was an
inexperienced virgin before she met Tyson.

She testified that she was a good Christian girl, and the prosecutor told the jury that she
expected to go home after her date with Tyson the same girl that she was before her date,

namely a virgin. She was an innocent, almost naive girl, according to the prosecutor. She knew

Dear Sirs: 
We are preparing an article about the calendaring today of Mr Edwards' claim against Mr Epstein for jury trial 
and the witness list which names_________________and other young women who allege they were underage 
victims of Mr Epstein. 
Mr Edwards claims that Mr Epstein maliciously attempted to intimidate him and his clients into retracting their 
claims. 
MsM further has stated to us that she intends to testify that she was flown to London by Mr Epstein and 
instructed to have sex at age 17 with Prince Andrew. She alleges that she was paid $15k for this encounter. 
She claims that on another occasion, Mr Epstein flew two young women to a dinner for the purpose of 
entertaining President Clinton. She claims she herself was sex trafficked to several other men, whose contact 
information is contained in an address book of Mr Epstein's filed in court records. 
May we have a comment please? Our deadline is 1pm tomorrow (SATURDAY) ET. 
Yours sincerely,

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021062.txt,"...Drilldown on USA Inc. Financials

e If entitlement programs are not reformed, USA Inc.’s balance sheet will go from bad to
worse

- Public debt has doubled over the last 30 years, to 62% of GDP. This ratio is expected to surpass the
90% threshold* — above which real GDP growth could slow considerably — in 10 years and could near
150% of GDP in 20 years if entitlement expenses continue to soar, per CBO.

- As government healthcare spending expands, USA Inc.’s red ink will get much worse if healthcare costs
continue growing 2 percentage points faster than per capita income (as they have for 40 years).

e The turning point: Within 15 years (by 2025), entitlements plus net interest expenses
will absorb all — yes, all — of USA Inc.’s annual revenue, per CBO

- That would require USA Inc. to borrow funds for defense, education, infrastructure, and R&D spending,
which today account for 32% of USA Inc. spending (excluding one-time items), down dramatically from
69% forty years ago.

- It's notable that CBO’s projection from 10 years ago (in 1999) showed Federal revenue sufficient to
support entitlement spending + interest payments until ZOG0E — 35 years later than current projection.

Note: *Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff observed from 3,700 historical annual data points from 44 countries that the

relationship between government debt and real GDP growth is weak for debt/GDP ratios below a threshold of 90 percent of GDP.

Above 90 percent, median growth rates fall by one percent, and average growth falls considerably more. We note that while

Reinhart and Rogoff’s observations are based on ‘gross debt’ data, in the U.S., debt held by the public is closer to the European

KP countries’ definition of government gross debt. For more information, see Reinhart and Rogoff, “Growth in a Time of Debt,” 1/10.
(@)E) www.kpcb.com USA Inc.| Summary 441

How Might One Think About Turning Around USA Inc.?...

e Key focus areas would likely be reducing USA Inc.’s budget deficit and improving /
restructuring the ‘business model’...

— One would likely drill down on USA Inc.’s key revenue and expense drivers, then develop a
basic analytical framework for ‘normal’ revenue / expenses, then compare options.

Looking at history...

— Annual growth in revenue of 3% has been roughly in line with GDP for 40 years* while
corporate income taxes grew at 2%. Social insurance taxes (for Social Security / Medicare)
grew 5% annually and now represent 37% of USA Inc. revenue, compared with 19% in 1965.

— Annual growth in expenses of 3% has been roughly in line with revenue, but entitlements are
up 5% per annum - and now absorb 51% of all USA Inc.’s expense - more than twice their
share in 1965; defense and other discretionary spending growth has been just 1-2%.

One might ask...

— Should expense and revenue levels be re-thought and re-set so USA Inc. operates near
break-even and expense growth (with needed puts and takes) matches GDP growth, thus
adopting a ‘don’t spend more than you earn’ approach to managing USA Inc.'s financials?

Note: *We chose a 40-year period from 1965 to 2005 to examine ‘normal’ levels of revenue and expenses. We did not choose the most recent
40-year period (1969 to 2009) as USA was in deep recession in 2008 / 2009 and underwent significant tax policy fluctuations in 1968 /1969, so

KP many metrics (like individual income and corporate profit) varied significantly from ‘normal’ levels.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028003.txt,"Early that evening, we were ordered to rejoin Bren’s division to be ready for
the crossing. When I reported that three of my soldiers were still missing, I was
ordered to inform the commander of the battalion replacing us to find the
missing men. The fight for the Chinese Farm was still not over. It would be
another 12 hours before, in a co-ordinated push by a strengthened armor and
infantry force, Israeli forces finally drove most of the Egyptians out. What
tenuous gains we’d made until then had come at an enormous price. Of
Yitzhik’s 300 men, nearly 40 were killed, and many others wounded. I’d led
around 130 people into battle. More than 35 were injured. Eleven were dead,
including Yishai Izhar and Motti Ben-Dror, our medical officer, killed while
treating the wounded. One of our missing soldiers was found alive. The other
two could only be brought home for burial.

As I began to hear the details of the previous days’ fighting, I became more
astonished, and angry. Israel’s tactics in the battle for the Chinese Farm had
involved a series of piecemeal strikes by units obviously too small, and
inadequately supported or co-ordinated, to succeed. The problem wasn’t the
choice of units. No one could doubt the record of Battalion 890, or of the men
Arik had sent in before Yitzhik arrived. But there was no way they were going
to take the area on their own. I couldn’t understand why there wasn’t an attempt
to assemble a force that might actually have been strong enough: parachutists,
tanks, artillery. I felt I knew at least part of the answer from the two nights I had
spent in the Um-Hashiba command post before joining Bren’s division. By
dawn on October 16, the first of Arik’s men had crossed the canal. By the
afternoon, although the big roller-bridge was still not ready, a smaller pontoon
bridge was available. Everyone knew we needed to get control of the Chinese
Farm. But all the field commanders were focused the real task, and the real
prize: crossing the canal and defeating the Egyptians on the other side.

Now, at least, the main crossing was underway. Bren had chanced the fact
that, with Yitzhik pinned down at the Chinese Farm and the Egyptians
concentrating their fire on his men and mine, he could get the pontoon bridge
through. From late afternoon on October 17, his first units began to cross. On
the morning of October 18, my battalion joined them. There was still fighting
ahead, and we were part of it: taking out the SAM sites, engaging units of the
Third Army and, with Sadat now pressing the Americans for a cease-fire and
many Egyptian units clearly losing the will to fight on, racing against the clock
to encircle and defeat it five days later.

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024516.txt,"KLC OpCo provides a wide range of quality programs that are continuously updated to reflect current
thinking and to meet the needs of individual children, Programs have been developed in conjunction with
nationally recognized experts in ECE and various curricula reflect the latest research in brain
development. Programs stimulate the social, emotional, intellectual and physical needs of children and
each program is age appropriate.

KLC OpCo's ECE facilities are generally open throughout the year, usually five days a week, from 6:30
a.m. to 6:30 p.m. New enrollments are most often highest in September and January, with the largest
decrease in enrollment during holiday periods and summer months. Many centers offer summer day
camp programs for children up to the age of 12. Additionally, many centers offer “back-up” care, which is
offered in the event that the parent's primary child care arrangement is unavailable {e.g., when an in-
home provider goes on vacation). The company will provide short-term child care until the parent's child
care resumes.

Community Centers

The 1,812 community centers are located in diverse demographic locations. Newly built centers tend to
be located in the targeted demographic market of newer upper-middle class to upper income suburban
areas with high concentrations of dual income families. In a community center, the current weekly tuition
rates for full-day service range from $90 to $400 per child, depending upon the center location and the
age of the child. KLC OpCo also offers tutorial programs in areas such as literacy, reading, foreign
languages and mathematics in many of its centers for a supplemental fee and is exploring offering
additional supplemental fee programs. Tuition is generally paid in advance on a weekly basis and, to a
lesser extent, on a monthly basis. The company typically sets tuition for half-day programs at a 20% to
40% premium compared with an equal number of hours for a full-day program. Approximately 20% of
tuition is paid under state and federal subsidy programs.

Employer-Sponsored Centers

As of FYE December 31, 2005, KLC OpCo operated 122 corporate or employer-sponsored centers.
These centers are typically free-standing, and are located at or near the premises or campus of the
employer-sponsor. These sites are different from community centers in that they usually have more
square footage per child and larger siaff areas. Generally, the corporate sponsor provides the
constructed building. KLC OpCo currently has relationships with a diverse group of employers, including
hospitals, health care facilities, government agencies, and private sector companies. Its corporate
relationships include, but are not limited to, the following: AOL Time Warner, TRW, Lockheed Martin, the
World Bank Group, Fox, Maytag, Northrop, TJ Maxx, the National Security Agency, the Mayo Clinic and
Stanford University.

Employer-sponsored centers are operated either on a fixed-fee basis (31 centers) or on a profit-and-loss
basis (91 centers). Under the former, KLC OpCo receives a fixed fee per monih, typically irrespective of
occupancy. In these contracts, the Company collects tuition on behalf of the employer sponsor. Under a
profit-and-loss contract, KLC OpCo collects tuition for its own account, generally with no guaranteed fees
from the employer. In some cases, Its operations are subsidized by the employer, typically in the form of
tuition subsidies, free or reduced rent, the provision of certain services such as maintenance, landscaping
and janitorial services or enrollment guarantees. This enables the company to utilize the subsidies for
improved staff quality and teacher / child ratios.

Contract terms typically average between one and five years. Normally the management centers are
reserved for children of the corporations’ employees. Some contracts provide for accepting non-
employee children, for which the company can often charge a higher tuition.

He guaranteed her a minimum of $200 each time she gave him what he called an ‘erotic massage.’

Virginia said: ‘| would always receive the money immediately. He would give me the cash from a wad he
carried in a black duffel bag or an assistant paid me.

‘And, because of the way Epstein had warped her sensibilities, every time she took the cash, Virginia felt
even more indebted to him. Secretly, he was also preparing her for an even more disturbing role.

Epstein had trained me to do whatever men wanted. |

‘Basically, | was training to be a prostitute for him. and his friends who shared his interest in young girls,’
she says: ‘After about two years, he started to ask me to “entertain” his friends.’

lt started when Epstein called Virginia at the Palm Beach apartment he had rented for her.

She recalls: ‘He said, “I’ve got a good friend and | need you to fly to the island to
entertain him, massage him and make him feel how you make me feel.”

He didn’t spell out what | had to do. He didn’t have to. ‘He’d trained me to do whatever a man wanted. |
was shocked but | told myself he was sharing me around because he trusted me and | was special.

| was worried, but | would do anything to keep Jeffrey happy and to keep my place as his number one
girl.

He would keep telling me how lucky | was with the life | was leading and the money | was making. It was
easy to fall into his grasp.

‘The way it usually worked was I'd be sent to meet a man on the private island Jeffrey owned in the
Caribbean, or at his ranch in New Mexico, which was really isolated.’ She was ‘given’ to men ranging in
age from their 40s to their 60s.

They included a well-known businessman (whose pregnant wife was asleep in the next room), a world-
renowned scientist, a respected liberal politician and a foreign head of state.

None appeared to think the arrangement was unusual. Virginia says there were many other girls in
Epstein’s circle and that she was paid extra money to help recruit them.

unpleasant-looking fluids (yellow, reddish-orange, brown), dry materials (sawdust?
flour?), and even insects drizzle or dust their way down the head, whose stoic sublimity is
made gorgeously virtual on the work’s enormous screens. Dead Imagine, through its
large-scale and cubic “Platonic” form, remains both artificial and locked into the body—
refusing a detached “intelligence” as being no intelligence at all.

Artists in the new millennium inherit this critical tradition and inhabit the current
paradigms of AI, which has slid from partial simulations to claims of intelligence. In the
1955 proposal thought to be the first printed usage of the phrase “artificial intelligence,”
computer scientist John McCarthy and his colleagues Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel
Rochester, and Claude Shannon conjectured that “every aspect of learning or any other
feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be
made to simulate it.” This modest theoretical goal has inflated over the past sixty-four
years and is now expressed by Google DeepMind as an ambition to “Solve intelligence.”
Crack the code! But unfortunately, what we hear cracking is not code but small-scale
capitalism, the social contract, and the scaffolding of civility. Taking away the jobs of
taxi and truck drivers, roboticizing direct marketing, hegemonizing entertainment,
privatizing utilities, and depersonalizing health care—are these the “whips” that Wiener
feared we would learn to love?

Artists can’t solve any of this. But they can remind us of the creative potential of
the paths not taken—the forks in the road that were emerging around 1970, before
“information” became capital and “intelligence” equaled data harvesting. Richly
evocative of what can be done with contemporary tools when revisiting earlier
possibilities is French artist Philippe Parreno’s “firefly piece,” so nicknamed to avoid
having to iterate its actual title: With a Rhythmic Instinction to Be Able to Travel Beyond
Existing Forces of Life (2014). Described by the artist as “an automaton,” the sculptural
installation juxtaposes a flickering projection of black-and-white drawings of fireflies
with a band of oscillating green-on-black binary figures. The drawings and binary
figures are animated using algorithms from mathematician John Horton Conway’s 1970
Game of Life, a “cellular automaton.”

Conway set up parameters for any square (“cell”) to be lit (“alive”) or dark
(“dead”) in an infinite, two-dimensional grid. The rules are summarized as follows: A
single cell will quickly die of loneliness. But a cell touching three or more other “live”
cells will also die, “due to crowding.” A cell survives and thrives if it has just two
neighbors... and soon. As one cell dies, it may create the conditions for other cells to
survive, yielding patterns that appear to move and grow, shifting across the grid like
evanescent neural impulses or bioluminescent clusters of diatoms. In Stephen Hawking’s
2012 film The Meaning of Life, the narrator describes Conway’s mathematical model as

Panetta, National Security Advisor Thomas Donilon.

On the issues:

Afghanistan/Pakistan: We have put al Qaeda on a path to defeat,
Obama announced last June, noting that the 33,000 surge troops he
sent to Afghanistan in 2009 would be out of the country by the
summer of 2012. Although a constant barrage of drone strikes and
special operations raids have taken a harsh toll on al Qaeda, it may be
difficult for Obama to make the case that Afghanistan has achieved
stability or that Hamid Karzai's government can stand on its own
without U.S. assistance.

Relations with Pakistan have deteriorated significantly under
Obama's tenure, particularly following the bin Laden raid. He has
pledged to constantly evaluate the relationship between the two
countries going forward but says he would be hesitant to cut off aid
that could help the Pakistani people strengthen their own society and
their own government.

Military spending: Backed by his then current defense secretary,
Robert Gates, Obama announced last April that the Pentagon will
lead a fundamental review of U.S. military capabilities in order to
cut $400 billion in defense spending over the next 10 years. We
need to not only eliminate waste and improve efficiency and
effectiveness, but conduct a fundamental review of America's
missions, capabilities, and our role in a changing world, Obama
said. Of course, major cuts could come sooner than that if the
congressional supercommittee fails to reach an agreement on deficit
reduction by Nov. 23.

Subpoena 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 19 and 22) relate to the federal action or Jeffrey Epstein.
For example, Request 24 seeks “All documents concerning, relating or referring to your
assertion that you met former President Bill Clinton, former Vice President Al Gore and/or Mary
Elizabeth “Tipper” Gore on Little Saint James Island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.” Defendant
claims that this discovery would go to the issue of whether or not Giuffre is telling the truth
about Defendant — but that effort at impeachment is clearly collateral at best and fails to address
the central issue in this case. That issue is whether the Defendant had any basis to support his
media assault against two lawyers claiming that they fabricated and then publicly filed false
charges of criminal conduct on the part of the Defendant. It is the Defendant’s credibility and
not the credibility of Giuffre that is the focus of this defamation action. Defendant suggests that
Giuffre must be a liar because it would be unheard of for one of Epstein’s young girls to have
met President Clinton. Quite the opposite is true. There are a number of accounts documenting
Clinton’s regular visits with Epstein. For example, Chauntae Davies recently showed pictures on
The Inside Edition program of her travels with other young women in the company of Bill
Clinton and Jeffrey Epstein on Epstein’s plane. See Exhibit 4, ‘Lolita Express’ Masseuse
Reveals Lurid Details from Jeffrey Epstein’s Private Plane For the Rich, Inside Edition, April
27, 2015. The Epstein flight logs also demonstrate that former President Bill Clinton traveled
with Jeffrey Epstein and other young women. See Exhibit 5, The Gauker, January 22, 2015. All
of that information, while no doubt interesting, is irrelevant to the defamation issue before this

Court except to the extent it casts doubt on the Defendant’s own credibility.

do with compartmentalization of
Hezbollah's covert activities. It is also,
however, a result of the group's multiple
identities -- Lebanese, pan-Shiite, pro-
Iranian -- and the group's multiple and
sometimes competing goals tied to these
different identities.

Hezbollah's ideological commitment to
Iranian Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
revolutionary doctrine of velayat-e

fagih (guardianship of the jurist), which
holds that a Shiite Islamic cleric should
serve as the supreme head of government,
is a key source of conflict. The group is
thus simultaneously committed to the
decrees of Iranian clerics, the Lebanese
state, its sectarian Shiite community within
Lebanon, and fellow Shiites abroad.

The consequences of these competing
ideological drivers was clear in July 2006,
when Hezbollah dragged Israel and
Lebanon into a war neither state wanted by
crossing the U.N.-demarcated border
between the two countries, killing three
Israeli soldiers, and kidnapping two more

time bombs like Social Security, Medicare, health care reform, climate change, money in politics,
gerrymandering, and infrastructure investment in a single term. This one-and-done term decouples
our candidate from the usual politics and gives them the power of promise and deliver decisive
action. A four-year term pledge ensures governance independent of campaign finance concerns and
narrow special interests inherent to winning re-election. This “fix-it” ticket would promise to force
decisions on all the underlying structural policy matters damaging America’s long-term prospects

and distorting our democracy. No more kicking the can down the road.

e This candidate should also pledge to push for laws passed that reflect the will of simple majorities
in Congress. Congress now only allows bills to move forward when a “majority of a majority”
supports the policy and on many levels seems fundamentally broken. This third-party president
could force votes based on a transparent reading of where the votes lie via coalition building. The
Senate filibuster power will present a high hurdle, but a third-party candidate would be a de facto
disruptor of the two-party system. Party discipline could well break down, and moderates in both
parties could form a powerful, decisive block willing to work with the new President. The policies
passed into law may not be ideal for either Democrats or Republicans, but for the major agenda
items that must be addressed for America’s long-term health, an imperfect fix that corrects course

is better than those that now have us hurtling toward national bankruptcy.

And if no candidate secures 270 electoral votes in 2020? The House of Representatives would choose the
next president. In 2016, reports suggested Michael Bloomberg declined to run on a third-party ticket for
fear of splitting support from Hillary Clinton and throwing the election to a GOP-controlled House of
Representatives who would then vote to select the president. The fear was the GOP controlled House

would have just elected Trump.

Would Democratic control of the House mean that the House would pick an alternative to Trump as
president? Each state delegation has a single vote in selecting a president and it is the incoming Congress
- the class elected in 2020 that would decide the election. But no matter which party has the speaker’s

chair, the GOP would almost certainly have the upper hand in the majority of state delegations controlled.

Lunch with Deepak I: LSD, Quantum 
Healing, and Plato 
A skeptic and a mystic seek common ground. Part one of four. 
Posted Jun 04, 2018 
In March, I attended a debate on the proposition The more we evolve, the less we need 
God, With Michael Shermer and Heather Berlin for the motion and Deepak Chopra and 
Anoop Kumar against the motion. The next day I published an account titled Do Not  
Debate Deepak Chopra (subtitle: He's not even wrong.). Soon after, Chopra reached out 
to me and invited me to lunch. In April I met him in his office at Deepak Homebase in 
Manhattan, we had lunch downstairs at ABC Kitchen, and returned to his office. This is a 
nearly full transcript of our two-hour conversation. 
This is part 1 of 4. Here are parts 2, and 
Matt: So, I'm curious why you invited me, what you wanted to talk about. 
Deepak: I read your article, Not Even Wrong. [Laughter.] That's been my label for a long 
time from a lot of people, so I thought I'd give you my perspective on what I think reality is 
and see if we can expand the conversation. 
Matt: So the debate, it seemed like it was ships crossing in the night. The two sides were 
talking about different things and so I think it was clear to___or everyone else had one 
conception about what the debate was going to be about: the usefulness of the idea of God as 
conceived in monotheistic religions. Whereas the two of you were___it seemed like you were 
avoiding that debate and talking about something else. 
Deepak: So let me give you a little background to that. The first time we were invited to the 
debate by the organizers____I didn't know who they were___the topic was, As we evolve do 
we need religion? So I called the organizers and I said, Let me rephrase that if you don't 
mind. Can we say, As we evolve do we need religious experience?' So they said We don't 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029509 
know what that means. I said, as I look across the religions of the world, the common 
features I see are: Number one: transcendence___as a religious experience, not the dogma, 
not the ideology, not the institution___but transcendence, going beyond subject-object split. 
Number two: the emergence of platonic values as a result of that experience, like the desire 
to know the truth, goodness, beauty, harmony, love, compassion, joy, equanimity, gratitude  
and humility, wonder, curiosity. It's very human but it gets overshadowed by everyday 
experience. And number three: a loss of the fear of death, because that happens to 
experience, not to the consciousness in which that experience occurs. I think they didn't 
understand that, honestly, so they rephrased it as Do we need God? So I said, Listen, 
before I even go there, can we have a conversation? So they were very gracious. We all got 
together with the board or whatever and we had a conversation. I said, Honestly, God is a 
very loaded term and if by God we mean some imagined deity or some dead white male in 
the sky then it's not something that we can even address because we don't have that 
conception of God as an imagined deity. 
Matt: You mean that's not something you personally can address? 
Deepak: Yeah I can't address it, nor can my partner. They said, Well if you make that clear 
up front, then it's fine, but we still want to maintain God in the title. So I was keen to have 
this conversation because Michael and I have been going back and forth for 30 years now, 
and I thought, Michael's come to a very good place with me personally. So we agreed to the 
title. But if you go to the Eastern wisdom traditions___Buddhism, Vedanta, Shaoism, all the 
Eastern traditions___then God is pure consciousness, period. So the debate, you're right, they 
were talking about the mythical God and we were talking about that which is inconceivable 
as consciousness but makes every concept possible. 
So I can give you a background on that because monotheistic religions are at war all the time 
amongst each other, and all of the problems in the world right now are a consequence of 
that. But nobody talks about What is a religious or spiritual experience? Hundreds of 
millions of people across the world don't have that idea at all that the monotheistic religions 
propose. In fact, if you go deep into the teachings of Buddhism, etc., the word God is not 
mentioned. Only consciousness is mentioned. Vedanta, only consciousness is mentioned. 
And it's a very different take on consciousness. So, if you'll allow me for a moment to 
explain that. So when I was a kid, I grew up in India with a father who was agnostic or 
atheist, who was trained in England as a cardiologist. He went on to become a very famous 
person. He discovered high altitude mountain sickness. When the Indian and Chinese army 
were fighting in Tibet he was putting catheters in people's hearts and measuring their 
cardiac pressures. He described high altitude pulmonary edema and hypertension. My 
mother was what you might call a Hindu. But even when she told us stories as kids and she 
talked about all these mythical gods and goddesses, she emphasized the fact that these are 
mythical, imaginary, symbolic expressions of deep aspirations in human consciousness to 
understand reality. Now she was also, by the way, she wasn't a very educated woman like 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029510 
my father was. But she had enough ideas in her upbringing to say that the world you 
experience as everyday reality is not real. She would say that probably because she had 
heard it an amount of times. But when you're a child, that sticks with you, that the world 
you experience is not real. So that's my childhood background until I went to medical 
school. Medical school, I embraced everything that my father had taught about reality being 
physical, material. He was actually more than___he was almost like Michael Shermer in the 
earlier days when I was growing up. 
Matt: How did your parents get along? 
Deepak: Oh he was a very loving person. 
Matt: Completely different philosophies. 
Deepak: Yeah but he was an amazing person in terms of being a physician. I mean this is 
long before technology. He could listen to a heart with a stethoscope and tell you, which you 
may or may not know, the PR interval, which means the difference in microseconds between 
the atrial and the ventricular beat, which you could verify on an electrocardiogram. He was 
astonishing as a diagnostician. He trained with Wallace Brigden in England who was one of 
the earlier pioneers in electrocardiography. He was a consultant to the royal heart hospital to 
the queen at one time before he came back to India, the British army. So, he was an amazing 
person but he was also very compassionate. On weekends he would see patients free of 
charge, and my mother would cook food for them and make sure they had enough money for 
their bus or their train. So there was a very compassionate aspect to him, but he didn't 
believe in religion or anything like that. 
So then when I went to medical school I totally embraced my father's constructs. Except for 
one or two experiences during medical school, which was in India by the way. And it was 
one of the newer medical schools after British independence, called the Indian Institute of 
Medical Sciences, and it was funded by, amongst other people, the Rockefeller Foundation, 
and so we had lots of international faculty. So in my fourth year of medical school, when the 
Beatles were in India___that's George Harrison behind you, by the way, in a turban sitting 
next to me. So that is a later picture but the Beatles came to India in 1969, when I was 
finishing my medical school. I didn't know these guys at that time. But Sergeant Pepper's 
had come out, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, and we had four medical students as visitors 
to our classroom for the summer from Harvard. And they had with them a bunch of LSD. So 
my first experience was___and I was just near 18, when we had the first LSD experience. 
And then another one. Twice. And suddenly what my mother had been saying all these years 
about the world being an illusion was in the way an epiphany to me, at the age of 17. I mean 
I saw that the construction of___dissolving of boundaries like this, this, this and melting 
away. And then just colors and shapes and forms and sounds. And then a vast nothingness 
with no boundaries. But I was there. Not as a body, not as a mind, not as anything I could 
identify with, but just totally boundless. It was totally life-shifting at the age of 18 years. But 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029511 
then what happened is the medical school is very busy. You have to study, pass exams, this, 
that. And I put that aside, that experience side. 
Then at the age of 22, I came to the United States, and I had to do a lot of hardship to get 
here. My father wanted me to follow in his footsteps and be an academic. He was a 
professor, too, of cardiology. So I worked hard. India wasn't encouraging people to leave. I 
had to go to Sri Lanka to pass my exams, I had to borrow money to get a flight to the United 
States, I passed all that, I had to spend a year in New Jersey at a very ordinary community 
hospital, hard-working, and I got a residency in Boston with various hospitals with 
academics. So, Harvard, Tufts, BU, internal medicine, hard work, no thinking about 
consciousness whatsoever. Just passing one exam after another, getting one fellowship after 
another. 
And then I came here in 1970, July 1, basically as an intern in a hospital that no longer exists 
in New Jersey, MuhlenbergHospital, but then in the next year I got into all these academic 
institutions in Boston and went from one to another. I trained in internal medicine. And then 
I had heard vaguely of a discipline called neuroendocrinology, and I had also heard vaguely 
of this new revolution in medicine at that time, which was looking at peptides in the 
circulation. And the peptide that was very popular at that time was something called opiates, 
which are now popular again, and the opioid receptor, with somebody called George 
Solomon in Washington, who was an expert in that, but I discovered that the number one 
guy in the world in neuroendocrinology at that time was a professor at Tufts New England 
Medical Center, and his name was Seymour Reichlin and he was a legend. Okay, so, if you 
found a snake in his garden he would dissect it and look at the hypothalamus and identify 
receptors for opioids, serotonin, this and that. I'll show you his photo recently. I just met him 
the other day at the consciousness conference, which is bizarre because I hadn't met him in 
all these years. He's 94, and he was giving a lecture on serotonin and mystical experiences, 
at the age of 94, and he came to my lecture, and he was one of the most amazing guys in the 
world, actually. It was a real joy to meet him. This is him, let me show you. Anyway I'll 
show you his photo in a second. He's 94, he gives talks on serotonin, but he was a legend. 
I got a fellowship with him, and through him I met somebody who is no longer alive, 
Candace Pert, who had actually discovered the opioid receptor, and she and I met at a 
conference. She later became the chief of brain chemistry at the NIH. And she told me these 
molecules that we're talking about, serotonin, opiates, oxytocin, dopamine they are the 
molecules of emotion. So that's the first time I've heard that expression. I said, You should 
write a book about it. She did. I wrote the foreword and it was for me one of the milestones 
of my life. And so I applied to Reichlin's fellowship and I got it, and it was like the most 
prestigious thing you could get. 
But then I had my own issues with medicine. Is this interesting to you? So I had my own 
issues, including the fact that I was seeing patients and I can see that the response was not 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029512 
predictable. You could give two patients the same disease and they had completely different 
outcomes. So at least in human beings, we didn't respond predictably. As does always occur, 
the bell-shaped curve, which there is to everything now. So, I started getting interested in 
mind-body medicine, and I would say I probably coined the phrase. In 1985 I wrote a book 
which nobody would accept, no publisher would accept, so I published it on my own, 
called Creating Health: Exploring the Mind-Body Connection. The book then was picked up 
by Houghton Mifflin and became at national bestseller. And I wrote another book 
called Quantum Healingwhich was vilified by the medical establishment because I was 
basically proposing, long before anybody was talking about entanglement, I was talking 
about the entanglement of mind, body, neuropeptides, molecules of emotion, etc., etc., from 
my own experience. But the books did very well with the lay public. The New England 
Journaldid a good review of Quantum Healing in 1988, but basically I'm still ridiculed for 
it by the regular medical establishment. 
Matt: Were you talking about quantum entanglement 
Deepak: I wasn't using the word quantum entanglement. I was talking about the fact that 
thoughts and molecules are inseparable, basically, and that between a thought and a 
molecule there's a gap, and that gap is consciousness. It's now 30 years since the book, and 
Rudy was my co-author. He's a neuroscientist at Harvard and the head of neuroscience at 
Mass General. He wrote the foreword to the reissue of Quantum Healing, which I'll send 
you, but it's almost now quaint with all that we know of now. But I used that word which 
annoyed a lot of people, including Richard Dawkins, who ridiculed me, and I said, Listen, 
I'm using it as a metaphor. 
All science, I was saying, was a metaphor anyway, but it was then that I also got very 
interested in meditation. And then I went to India, and I spend about 10 years in India 
talking to these teachers, basically, of consciousness, where consciousness is fundamental 
reality, it is beyond thought or experience, and the word they use is pure consciousness. So I 
went through an experience with a teacher of meditation who basically asked me questions 
like I can ask you right now. What is this? [Matt: It's a glass.] And what's this? [Matt: 
Flower.] And what's this? [Matt: A candle.] What's this? [Matt: A Sharpie.] What's 
this? [Matt: A hand. Did I get them all right?] So far. I said the same thing. But I was 
having a conversation with somebody, and he said to me, Those are human 
constructs. And I was trying to tell this person, who was a meditation teacher, I was telling 
him about the molecules of emotion. Serotonin. He said they're not real. 
So that got me thinking, okay, and I seriously went into wanting to experience pure 
consciousness, which they all talk about, as transcendence, beyond subject-object split. So, 
this person that I had this conversation with, he said, If you were a baby and you had no 
language, not exposed to any language, this would not be a hand. This would be a shape, a 
form, a color, maybe a smell, a texture, a sensation, as an activity of consciousness. But then 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029513 
you would be told, This is a hand, you have a body, and then you would have an 
interpretation of that experience, which you would call a thought. And then you would also 
be told, This is your body. You have a mind. You're Indian. And you come from a Hindu 
family.' All social constructs. Fundamental reality is sensory perception, which is an 
activation of consciousness, and its interpretation is thought. The rest is a story. Mind, body, 
and even universe is a story. Well, that was pretty mind-boggling for a young person at 
the age of 35. I'd already trained now, here. Slowly, that lead to how one construct leads to 
another construct. Okay, so this is an iPhone. It's matter. Well I have now reified sensory 
experience in consciousness, an activity of consciousness in consciousness, with a construct, 
iPhone. Then I reify it further, made of matter. And now this is very convenient. I can study 
it. It's made of molecules, made of atoms. So one construct leads to another construct, 
particles. Then you get ultimately to possibility waves and then you're stuck again. 
Okay [laughter], but along the chain, one construct built to another construct to another 
construct to another construct. Very useful. New York City is a construct. Latitude is a 
construct. Longitude is a construct. Time is it construct. Money is a construct. Wall Street is 
a construct. Religion is a construct. God is a construct. Universe is a construct, which you 
call a model, Okay. So, this led me to consciousness, exploring consciousness. Where now, 
you have___you know I just came from this conference, on the science of consciousness, 
where you have physicalists, you have dualists, you have panpsychists, you have idealists, 
and they're all arguing about the constructs. 
So the physicalists are now in a difficult position, because they're trying to explain 
consciousness with the construct of physicality, and you can't. Because physicality itself is a 
construct. Then you have the idealists going back to Plato who are saying it's all mental. But 
even mental ideas are constructs. Then you have the dualists, Descartes, the two are 
separate, mind and body. But then how do you explain their interaction? It violates simple 
laws like thermodynamics. If mind is separate and body is separate, how do I lift my arm? I 
start with a thought so I do this. How do I speak, how do I walk, how do I do anything? So, 
dualism doesn't make me happy. Idealism doesn't make me happy. Physicalism, I don't 
know what matter is anymore. 
I interviewed the Nobel laureate Wilczek, physicist from MIT. So I said, What is 
matter? It's particles. I said, What are particles, subatomic particles? He says, They are 
little things. I said, But then everybody says that's a wave potential, that's in Hilbert space. 
What is that? Where is Hilbert space? He says, It's mathematical. What is it? It's 
infinitely dimensional or zero dimensional. Where is it? The usual answer is Shut up and 
calculate, right? So I realized that the entire new paradigm of multiverse, superstrings, 
eternal inflation, whatever, is all in mathematical imagination. Hilbert space is in 
mathematical imagination, the wave potential is in mathematical imagination. I said to 
Wilczek, What is matter? And he said, We're still trying to figure that out. [Laughter.] I 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029514 
mean this is coming from a Nobel laureate who discovered a particle, you know. So I 
ended up where I began, which is non-dualism, that there is only consciousness. 
Matt: Isn't that idealism? 
Deepak: Idealism comes out of non-dualism. 
Matt: So there are two types of monism [non-dualism]. There's materialism and then there 
is idealism. [Each holds that] there's only matter or there's only consciousness. 
Deepak: Okay then we can say idealism is closest to non-duality. They don't use that word 
in the East. Let's go for lunch. [We head downstairs.] 
Deepak: With idealism one usually relates to Plato in the West or to Bishop Berkeley and 
all those guys, you know. But basically, what idealism espouses, it's mental. But non-
dualism says even mental is a construct. When you say mental you have words. As soon as 
you have a word for an experience it's no longer fundamental. 
Matt: Non-dualism is a construct too. 
Deepak: If I have to use words, yes. 
Matt: There's no getting away from constructs. 
Deepak: No, there is a way of getting away from constructs. It's called transcendence. Shut 
up and just be. 
Matt: We never stop filtering experience 
Deepak: Every experience is filtered through given constructs. There is no getting away 
from it. But then we start looking at consciousness____let's find our table. [We find our table.]

make a letter T.

or more rubber bands and a pile of pins, and asked to use the pins to hold the band in place to
form a particular shape)... For example, things to be learnt could include”:

1. There is an area inside the band and an area outside the band.

2. The possible effects of moving a pin that is inside the band towards or further away
from other pins inside the band. (The effects can depend on whether the band is already
stretched.)

3. The possible effects of moving a pin that is outside the band towards or further away from
other pins inside the band.

4, The possible effects of adding a new pin, inside or outside the band, with or without pushing
the band sideways with the pin first.

5. The possible effects of removing a pin, from a position inside or outside the band.

6. Patterns of motion/change that can occur and how they affect local and global shape
(e.g. introducing a concavity or convexity, introducing or removing symmetry, increasing or
decreasing the area enclosed).

7. The possibility of causing the band to cross over itself. (NB: Is an odd number of crosses
possible?)

8. How adding a second, or third band can enrich the space of structures, processes and effects
of processes.

9.4.5 What Kind of Physics Is Needed to Foster Human-like
Intelligence?

We stated above that we would like an AGI’s environment to support all the fundamental phe-
nomena that naive physics deals with; and we have now reviewed a number of these specific
phenomena. But it’s not entirely clear what the “fundamental” aspects underlying these phe-
nomena are. One important question in the environment-design context is how close an AGI
environment needs to stick to the particulars of real-world naive physics. Is it important that a
young AGI can play with the specific differences between spreading peanut butter versus jelly?
Or is it enough that it can play with spreading and smearing various substances of different
consistencies? How close does the analogy between an AGI environment’s naive physics and

Keating says: It's because president Mitterrand and the French wanted it. They weren't ready to sit beside the
German unified state without some friends.

So the eurozone was flawed from the outset, a structure awaiting internal assault: The problem is we have a single
currency without a political union and without a fiscal union.

The second blunder was the 1990s expansion of NATO to the Russian border. For Keating, this was recklessness
for which the world may yet pay.

Sensible policy would have included a place for Russia in the new world order, he says. But that didn't happen.
So Russian liberals were pushed to one side by Russian nationalists. In a sense the US has created Vladimir Putin.

Who is responsible? He points the finger at Bill Clinton.

On the 2008 financial crisis, he says former US Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan must bear a fair amount of
responsibility”.

Greenspan is someone | know and like, Keating says. But if you are so naive to believe that institutions with a
balance sheet with assets geared at 45 to one is not an accident waiting to happen then you don't deserve to be
chairman of the Federal Reserve.

He praises Obama for seeking a return to the “liberal internationalism” that, in Keating's view, made the US great in
the post-World War Il age. This is the US he loves but it is still in retreat.

Asked about the nature of leadership, Keating reveals what lies within his heart: I believe there is a poetic strand to
life that doesn't exist in an economics textbook.

This is not to say that rationalism isn't important and good. It is. But left to itself without the guidance of higher
meaning and a higher concept, rationalism can be mean and incomplete. | say if you simply live on rational policy
and briefing notes you are not sufficiently informed.

You need a higher calling or some inner system of belief - here | mention Kant and the inner command that tells
you what is true, what is right, what is good. The inner command must be the divining construct in what you do.

Music has always been a large part of what makes me tick. You listen to a great work .. . you hear the majesty of
these works and your head and soul gets caught up in them. When that happens you are in for bigger things and

you will strike out to be better.

When | was listening to music | would always have the pad out to write the ideas down.

slow and often costly business. This is one of the particular
grievances that have powered the protest movement, though certainly
the ripples of the successful Egyptian and Tunisian uprisings played a
hand. The government, to put it bluntly, responded poorly. Troops in
Daraa fired live rounds against youthful demonstrators and virtually
all communications -- Internet and telephone -- were shuttered to
prevent the seepage of unrest.

To make matters worse, Damascus blamed Israeli provocateurs, rebel
forces, and shady foreign agents for the bloodshed -- anyone but its
own forces. Civilian deaths at the hands of security forces there, and
more recently in the coastal city of Latakia, have outraged opinion
across the country, setting alight long pent-up anger at the denial of
basic freedoms, the monopolistic rule of the Baath party, and the
abuses of a privileged elite. To these ills should be added severe
youth unemployment, devastation of the countryside by a grave
shortage of rainfall over the past four years, and the impoverishment
of the middle and lower classes by low wages and high inflation.

In response to the public unrest, the regime has released some
political prisoners and pledged to end the state of emergency in force
since 1963. A government spokeswoman has hinted that coming
reforms will include greater freedom for the press and the right to
form political parties. President Bashar al-Assad is due to address the
country in the next 48 hours. His speech is eagerly awaited, but it
remains to be seen whether it will be enough to defuse the crisis and
win time for the regime. If not, demonstrations could gather pace,
triggering still more violent repression by the security services -- an
escalation with unpredictable consequences.

The protesters have in fact challenged the fundamentals of Syria's
security state, a harsh system of controls over every aspect of society,
put in place by the late Hafez al-Assad, Bashar's father, who ruled for
30 years from 1970 to his death in 2000. By all accounts, the debate

room. (Epstein says too it’s a reminder that elephants
have 23 copies of tumor suppressor genes and humans
have only 1.) The single book on his bedside table is
Lolita (he is, beyond the joke, a great Nobokov fan).

And, too, he seems often to be right. Since I began
working on this piece in September, Epstein predictions
about the price of oil, yen, ruble, and euro have all born
out. If I had invested $100,000 the way Epstein said I
should in early September, by the end of January I
would have made $2.4 million. (Alas, I did not invest.)

At any one moment, he is making a series of bets
for himself and others--very much not as a workaday
hedge fund, and much more as a privileged association.
Money is always about the club it gets you into.

Most everyone who is now of a certain age and
ambition and status grew up in, and found they were
temperamentally suited to, the era of wealth that started
in the late 1970s. A meritocracy on steroids, or, as
Vanity Fair would baldly dub it, the new establishment,
an increasingly parallel world, a self-invented one, at
further and further remove from the ordinary one.
Epstein’s is just one version.

Epstein often tells, with some obvious marvel, his
middle class to riches tale: born in 1953 in Coney
Island, father worked for the city’s Parks Department,
mother a housewife.

Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 17 of 23

V: Yes, he did. He did all the time. The worst one that I heard from his own mouth was this
pretty 12 year old girls he had flown in for his birthday. It was a surprise birthday gift
from one of his friends and they were from France. I did see them, I did meet them.
Jeffrey bragged afterwards after he met them that they were 12 year olds and flown over
from France because they’re really poor over there, and their parents needed the money
or whatever the case is and they were absolutely free to stay and flew out. Those were
the worst ones. He was constantly bragging about girls’ ages or where he got them from
or their past and how terrible their past was and good he is making it for them.

JS: Where were the 12 year old girls flown to from France? Where did they come to?
V: Palm Beach.

JS: | And were they flown in on Jeff's private plane or did they get transported?

V: No. They were transported by somebody else.

JS: | Ok. Was the sexual activity that went on on the airplane conducted in such a way so that
any of the crew was aware of what was going on?

V: They were told to knock if they had to come out, if the crew had to come out. They were
told, you know, to come out as little as possible, so they weren’t out there hanging out
watching everything, no, but it doesn’t take an idiot to put two and two together to say
well there’s a whole bunch of half dressed teenagers on board with this old man who is
constantly being massaged by them and he wants me to keep the door shut for what
reason? I mean, only they could put that together, but yeah, they knew.

JS: | Did Mr. Epstein ever talk to you about people of power and influence owing him favors?

V: He would laugh about it, you know, I never really knew what to take serious from Jeffrey
because he was such a funny character at times. You never knew if what he was saying
was true or not. Yeah, lots of people owed him favors from what he told me. He’s got
everybody in his pocket, and he would laugh about he helps people for the sole purpose
in the end they owe him something. That’s why I believe he does so many favors in the
first place.

JS: | When and how did you first become aware that Mr. Epstein was in trouble with the law?

V: I was first informed by, I think someone from the FBI called me first and started to ask
me questions, and J started to answer the questions but then fear took over, and I just said
look, I don’t know what’s going on, I’ve got a young family that I don’t want to risk, you
know, please don’t bother me about this again, and it was real short simple conversation,
and within a week or 2, I had gotten a call from Jeffrey’s attorney, and then a week later,
Jeffrey himself.

2010. What had happened was, S.R. was a young
woman who had been sexually abused by Jeffrey
Epstein. She was identified in the
nonprosecution agreement as sex abuse victim, and
we had a civil suit going against Mr. Epstein and
her case was set for trial. It was going to be
the first trial against Mr. Epstein.

You know, this -- he had abused, according to
the NPA, I think 35 girls, and at that point I
think, gosh, I think 31 of them had settled, all
the girls except for the three represented by
Mr. Edwards and I had settled.

So this was going to be the first person that
was going to bring, if you will, the light of day
to this. This was going to be the first time
where this was going to be tried in open court.
So this was potentially an opportunity to, you
know, expose exactly what Epstein has done
because people are going to be called as
witnesses including Epstein and others like him.

So this was, I think, a potentially explosive
situation for Mr. Epstein because all of the --
all of the crimes that his organization had been
committing were going to be exposed during the

course of this trial. So -- but this all

	This South Beach newcomer lives up to the hype. Set in two landmark Art Deco buildings on Collins Avenue, right behind the former Versace Mansion, the boutique hotel has 108 sleek guestrooms washed in blue and white, and access to soft, sandy beaches, a restaurant helmed by chef Geoffrey Zakarian and a hip rooftop pool scene.

	Reinvented from the former Hotel Hana Maui, the brand new Travaasa Hana combines - in concept and name - travel and pravaasa (memorable journey in Sanskrit). The mix of adventure, relaxation and truly experiencing a destination are hallmarks of Travaasa. With the beauty of Hana, Hawaii, all around, it's hard to imagine a better marriage of purpose and place.

	It's rare to find a luxury resort as down to earth as this Condé Nast Traveler Hot List alum. Sitting on 50 wild acres of jungle by the beach, this striking Italian-style villa has white sand-colored interiors that match the serene beach outside. The Duchess of Ferrari originally built this tropical hideaway on Mexico's fabled Yucatan Peninsula in the early 1990s to entertain her globetrotting friends. It has since been remade as a 29-room boutique wonder, where that local culture is so intrinsic to the design that it can be found in the minutest details.

	On a nine-mile stretch of Playa Blanca, just 20 minutes from downtown Zihuatanejo, Hotel Las Palmas is unique escape between lush rain forest and the open Pacific Ocean. All 10 suites were individually designed by Enrique Zozaya in a sleek, modern-tropical style and capture the unspoiled views on private terraces and balconies. With the soaring Sierra Madre del Sur mountains in the distance and sleepy fishing village of Barra de Potosi close by, the Hotel Las Palmas is a true barefoot hideaway in a quintessentially Mexican setting.

	There's a lot to love in Long Beach. It's the sixth largest city in California (with nearly half a million people), one half of the western hemisphere's largest port, and it's finally coming into its own as a magnet for travelers. The modern, 138-room AVIA Hotel sits at the epicenter of all the action. And the cheery Long Beach lovers staffing the property are happy to highlight the best of the city.

	It's hard to imagine, but true: Summer will slip away before you know it. Which means it's time for a mini-getaway to one of your favorite cities. And this is the time to go - the streets are quieter, the parks are in bloom and concerts, movies and performances are staged nearly every day. We've got last-minute availability at the Landmark London and three Manhattan standouts: the elegant Hôtel Plaza Athénée, the family-friendly Roger Williams and the über-sleek Thompson LES. Choosing can be tough when the options are so good.

	Located 20 minutes north of Miami Beach in the heart of Aventura, Fairmont Turnberry Isle Resort & Club mixes country club charm with the sleek styling of a boutique hotel. The 392-room property is home to two Raymond Floyd-designed golf courses and the Laguna Pool, which features a water slide, a lazy river and cabanas outfitted with TVs and refrigerators (this is Miami, after all). With its family-friendly vibe, Turnberry Isle falls somewhere between Grossinger's in the Catskills (at its legendary height) and a posh island resort.

	In the city's former stock exchange building, the 306-room Sofitel is retrofitted with streamlined rooms and an intimate brasserie. This Philadelphia gem is where French and American style come together - think Shaker quilts next to spacious marble bathrooms - in the French Quarter of an All-American destination.

	Epic renderings of sandstone and the frothy beauty of the Colorado River form the backdrop for Austin-Lehman's six-day exploration of the Utah desert in and around its fabled adventure capital, Moab. Guests hop on bicycles, bound down the river in rafts, clamber into 4x4s, and, of course, hike into some of the most jaw-dropping geology on the planet. Evenings are as relaxing as the days are active, with a fixed homebase - a lodge set against red-rock cliffs that happens to have its own winery.

	Known as Napa of the North, Canada's Okanagan region is a year-round retreat east of Vancouver. The area is home to award-winning wineries, Canada's warmest lake and a stunning desert landscape fit for golfing virtually every day of the year. With exceptional service and Pueblo-style architecture, Spirit Ridge Vineyard Resort & Spa is just as much a hotel for oenophiles looking to unwind as it is for golf fanatics and families looking to take advantage of mild weather and myriad activities.

	Near swank shops and Houston's art-gallery scene, the Hotel Derek is designed to feel like a superhip home, with 60s-style settees, English wingback chairs and cowhide rugs. The hotel works on the assumption that its guests have the same qualities as the fictional host, Derek: worldliness, a sense of humor and an eye for beauty.

	It starts with a grand entrance: You'll walk in on a three-story staircase as wide as an IMAX screen. A double-sided fireplace and baby grand piano jazz up the lobby while Technicolor furnishings like cherry-red sofas and silver wallpaper add to the whimsical vibe. The Allegro, a Kimpton hotel, is a vibrant example of boutique-style hospitality in Chicago that playfully tips its hat to old-world glamour without ever taking itself too seriously.

	In the mountainous north of the country, just over an hour from Porto, the recently opened Vidago Palace has, in one fell swoop, raised the bar for luxury getaways in Portugal. As far removed from the sun and sand of the touristy Algarve as you can get, this is a destination for the discerning traveler and the lover of fine things, whether they be cigars, hand-painted silk wallpaper, the country's best spa or a championship golf course.

	With 285 rooms, Crete's Candia Maris beachfront resort is large by Greek hotel standards. It shares the space between the large and airy guestrooms, a choice of restaurants and a host of activities, whatever your interest. Waterbabies will love the seven pools and sybarites can camp out in the resort's Thalassotherapy spa. Overlooking Amoudara beach just outside Heraklion, the resort underwent a top-to-bottom renovation five years ago, adding modern style and amenities to this uber-resort.

	Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda made this elegant B&B famous in the 1981 film On Golden Pond, but three decades later the 13-acre estate on Squam Lake remains a revered and romantic New Hampshire countryside escape. With unbeatable views of the White Mountains, Manor on Golden Pond has distinctive guestrooms - from the Cotswold Cottage to the Canterbury Manor - plus all the trappings of a sophisticated inn, with the English heritage to back it up.

	Grenada is known as the most gregarious of the Caribbean islands, and Maca Bana, on a secluded cove on the Point Salines peninsula, represents a microcosm of that, from the general manager to the gardener. The boutique villa hotel (appropriately named after a tree in the indigenous Arawak language) has an infinity pool and beachside restaurant to entertain, plus each villa has a deck with a private hot tub. And even though the resort is just five minutes from the airport, it feels worlds away.

	With room decor by Ralph Lauren, Round Hill is a true standout among the properties along the northwest coast of Jamaica. High-end yet relaxed, it has sprawling grounds and a full-service attitude that invites total indulgence for guests. It's also got awe-inspiring views of the Caribbean from the rooms, restaurants and infinity pool, where visitors feel as if they're literally floating in the sea.

	Skilled in the art of seduction, the Fairmont Royal Pavilion was one of the first great beach hotels to open on Barbados. Refreshed by a major 2010 renovation, this graceful Colonial-style estate makes the most of its location - by day guests swim, sail and cavort along the powdery beach or simply enjoy the views from a private terrace overlooking the water. And by night, one of the island's most elegant tables will be available, where dinner is served with the serenading sounds of the surf.

	This six-day journey with Momentum Adventure explores the wild, stark landscape of the Baja Peninsula, and balances adrenaline-infused outings with relaxation at the iconic One&Only Palmilla. Navigate a Baja Challenger racecar through sand washes, cactus forests and lone beaches; score a hole-in-one at a Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course; and fish for blue marlins in a yacht off the shore. Come evening, sip tequila in a breezy villa that overlooks the Sea of Cortez.

Service here is some of the finest and friendliest in the region, a trait nowhere more evident than at the all-suite Alila Sothea. The hotel's regal 39 rooms, which surround a glittering slate-and-gold-leaf-tiled pool, offer a tranquil, resort-like atmosphere that's rich with local culture and just 20 minutes by car from Angkor.

	The best part of staying at the Anantara Bophut - besides the fact that it's on a beautiful Koh Samui beach - is the activities menu, which keeps every type of traveler entertained. Spend mornings windsurfing or learning Thai kickboxing, and afternoons cooking authentic regional dishes or snorkeling in the Gulf of Thailand. If you're craving some slothful downtime, relax next to the giant lagoon-style infinity pool or in the blissful spa.

	Though it's just steps from Bangkok's best shopping malls (and the city's notorious traffic-thronged streets), the Siam Kempinski Hotel Bangkok manages to provide a tranquil getaway that feels miles from the city's chaos. Capitalizing on the hotel brand's European roots, the design is an artful blend of Art Deco accents and Thai flourishes. In 303 rooms, huge beds, baths and work/lounge areas provide ample space to recharge, while the amenities - a pool area, a spa and one of the city's best restaurants - offer plenty of excuses to stay close to home.

	Named for James Madison, the fourth president and father of the Constitution, this stately hotel has traditional style and refined service to match - plus, a location that puts many of Washington's must-see museums and monuments along the National Mall within walking distance. Opened in 1963, the 353-room hotel has hosted the Dalai Lama, the occasional celebrity and every U.S. president since John F. Kennedy except Barack Obama. Not to worry - you can stop by the White House, just five blocks away.

emails. The Los Angeles-based venture capitalist, who served as top fundraiser for the
Republican Party and President Trump, has said that allegations against him are an effort by
his enemies to smear him.

Rudolph W. Giuliani, an attorney for Trump, said he had no knowledge of any request for
records related to Broidy. The White House referred a request for comment to the
Republican National Committee, which declined to comment.

[Trump fundraiser Elliott Broidy sues Qatar alleging cyber smear campaign]

In recent weeks, prosecutors with the Justice Department’s public integrity section — which
examines possible political and government corruption — have sought documents related to
Broidy’s business dealings.

Among the information sought by investigators are details about Broidy’s work on behalf of
and interactions with the Chinese and Malaysian officials, according to two people familiar
with the document requests.

As part of their efforts, prosecutors have subpoenaed casino magnate Steve Wynn, the
former RNC finance chairman and longtime Trump friend, for copies of records and
communications related to Broidy.

An attorney for Wynn, Reid Weingarten, declined to comment, saying only that Wynn is
cooperating with the Justice Department.

“Steve Wynn is completely cooperating with the investigation and he certainly has no reason
to believe that anyone acted improperly in anything he knew about or was involved in,”
Weingarten said in a statement.

Wynn was tapped by Trump to serve as the RNC’s lead fundraiser after the election. Earlier
this year, he stepped down from that post and from his executive role at his resort company
after reports of sexual misconduct. Wynn has denied the allegations of inappropriate
behavior.

The public integrity probe is the latest legal challenge for Broidy, who helped corral big
donors to support Trump’s presidential campaign, throwing a lavish fundraiser for the then-
nominee at his Los Angeles-area home during the 2016 campaign. After the election, he was
appointed to serve as a national deputy chairman for the RNC.

Broidy sought to parlay his party role and connections to the White House and on Capitol
Hill in pitches to foreign governments, according to a person with direct knowledge of his
activities.

1. You’ve said that the women pressing suits against Mr. Epstein have lied repeatedly, and in
no way shape or form were they victims. They were at his place freely and voluntarily. And one
of them showed Epstein a fake ID. What do you have to say now that Mr. Epstein has
admitted in his federal plea bargain that he did conspire to entice minors to engage in
prostitution? Accepting that these women came voluntarily, isn’t Mr Epstein still guilty of
statutory rape?

2. Brad Edwards, an attorney who represents three of the women, recently served a
Subpoena to Testify at a Deposition on Epstein’s former girlfriend, Ghislaine
Maxwell. The Subpoena asks that Maxwell produce “a list of all girls” that visited
Jeffrey Epstein’s homes in Palm Beach and Manhattan, or flew on his

planes. Edwards said in an interview that Maxwell was “second-in-command of
Epstein’s criminal enterprise.” He added, “She was on Epstein's plane, transporting girls
for the purpose of having sex with other people. She kept a computer database of hundreds of
girls and oversaw the schedule of girls who came to Epstein's homes.”

3. A suit filed last May by “Jane Doe 102” against Epstein alleges that, after recruiting her as a 15-
year-old girl to give Epstein massages, Maxwell and Epstein took part in “sexually assaulting,
battering, exploiting, and abusing Plaintiff.”

4. The same suit alleges that Epstein “lured” the girl “every day for next two weeks” to his
house. The suit claims that she eventually became a “sex slave” to Epstein, traveling with him
around the world. “In all of these locations, she was required to engage in sex acts with him and
other women - including other minors.”

5. Did Jane Doe 102 — who now lives in Australia — go on the 2002 trip where
President Clinton flew on Mr. Epstein’s Boeing 727?
6. “Most of these acts of abuse occurred during a time when defendant [Jane Doe 102] knew

that the plaintiff was approximately 15, 16 and 17 years old and, after years of daily sexual
exploitation continued into her adulthood ... until she fled at age 19,

7. When Maxwell and Epstein celebrated Jane Doe 102’s 16th birthday with her, Epstein joked that
he would have to “trade her in” because she was getting too old for him.
8. Not only was Jane Doe 102 required to satisfy Epstein's every sexual whim, but she also was

exploited by Epstein's adult male peers. They included “royalty, politicians, academicians,
businessmen and others in various locations around the world.”

9. The Palm Beach Post and lawyers representing Epstein’s alleged victims have called his federal
non-prosecution agreement a “secret,” backroom, sweetheart” deal, noting that none of his
alleged victims was consulted. Several critics have claimed Epstein “bought” the agreement, using
politically-connected lawyers. Would he like to comment?

Thanks to Turing’s insight into coding schemes and the machines
he designed, the British were soon able to read almost every coded
message the Germans sent during the war, giving the Allies an enormous
advantage. The D-Day invasion involved convincing Hitler that the Allies
had a huge army of nearly 400,000 men, massed around Dover preparing
an attack on Calais head on, with a second army in Scotland poised to
attack Norway. In truth, they had only 150,000 men planning an assault
on the Normandy Beaches in the South. Just before the landings messages
were decoded showing Hitler had fallen for the Allied subterfuge. Even
as the Normandy landings began, Hitler still thought this a bluff and
kept his 28 divisions at Calais waiting for the imagined attack. Without
this intelligence advantage, the Allies would have needed a much larger
invasion force, and Churchill believed Turing’s work shortened the war
by as much as two years.

The cracking of Enigma remained a secret after the war and
Turing’s story remained untold for many years. When Churchill wrote
his history, The Second World War, a massive work in six volumes, all
sorts of sensitive information featured, but Turing’s work was omitted.
One sentence hints that Churchill might write something about it in the
future, but he never did. Churchill considered the work at Bletchley Park
so sensitive he had it put in the highest classification — extending the
30-year secrecy rule. We must presume the decoding schemes were still
being deployed during the Cold War. The papers were finally released in
2010.

In one of those sad turns in history Turing was found guilty of gross
indecency for homosexuality in 1954, a criminal act at the time, and was
prescribed hormone treatment. This affected his mental state and he took
his life by eating an apple laced with cyanide. He was eventually honored
posthumously as a war hero and one of the most significant thinkers of
the 20 Century. A Turing Award is the equivalent of the Nobel Prize for
Computing. He was given a royal pardon in 2013.

To see how Turing came up with the idea for the Turing machine
and solved the decision problem, we need to get a feel for theoretical
mathematics. That might sound a little heavy going but don’t worry, I will
use a simple piece of mathematics to explain, one we have all played with
as children, secret codes.

This paralysis led the three advisers to rely on the other particularly effective way to
move him, which was to use the media. Hence each man became an inveterate and
polished leaker. Bannon and Kushner studiously avoided press exposure; two of the most
powerful people in government were, for the most part, entirely silent, eschewing almost
all interviews and even the traditional political conversations on Sunday morning
television. Curiously, however, both men became the background voices to virtually all
media coverage of the White House. Early on, before getting down to attacking each
other, Bannon and Kushner were united in their separate offensives against Priebus.
Kushner’s preferred outlet was Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski’s Morning Joe, one
of the president’s certain morning shows. Bannon’s first port of call was the alt-right
media (“Bannon’s Breitbart shenanigans,” in Walsh’s view). By the end of the first month
in the White House, Bannon and Kushner had each built a network of primary outlets, as
well as secondary ones to deflect from the obviousness of the primary ones, creating a
White House that simultaneously displayed extreme animosity toward the press and yet
great willingness to leak to it. In this, at least, Trump’s administration was achieving a
landmark transparency.

The constant leaking was often blamed on lower minions and permanent executive
branch staff, culminating in late February with an all-hands meeting of staffers called by
Sean Spicer—cell phones surrendered at the door—during which the press secretary
issued threats of random phone checks and admonitions about the use of encrypted texting
apps. Everybody was a potential leaker; everybody was accusing everybody else of being
a leaker.

Everybody was a leaker.

One day, when Kushner accused Walsh of leaking about him, she challenged him back:
“My phone records versus yours, my email versus yours.”

But most of the leaks, certainly the juiciest ones, were coming from the higher-ups—
not to mention from the person occupying the topmost echelon.

The president couldn’t stop talking. He was plaintive and self-pitying, and it was
obvious to everyone that if he had a north star, it was just to be liked. He was ever
uncomprehending about why everyone did not like him, or why it should be so difficult to
get everyone to like him. He might be happy throughout the day as a parade of union steel
workers or CEOs trooped into the White House, with the president praising his visitors
and them praising him, but that good cheer would sour in the evening after several hours
of cable television. Then he would get on the phone, and in unguarded ramblings to
friends and others, conversations that would routinely last for thirty or forty minutes, and
could go much longer, he would vent, largely at the media and his staff. In what was
termed by some of the self-appointed Trump experts around him—and everyone was a

was a convincing indication that you had an unbreakable bond with him and that you
were, in his eyes, and in his White House, something close to omnipotent. Trump, with his
love of generals, had even for a moment wanted to make Michael Flynn his vice president.

Intoxicated by Trump’s flattery during the campaign, Flynn—a lower-tier general and
quite a flaky one at that—had become something of a Trump dancing monkey. When
former generals make alliances with political candidates, they customarily position
themselves as providers of expertise and figures of a special maturity. But Flynn had
become quite a maniacal partisan, part of the Trump traveling road show, one of the
ranters and ravers opening Trump rallies. This all-in enthusiasm and loyalty had helped
win him access to Trump’s ear, into which he poured his anti-intelligence-community
theories.

During the early part of the transition, when Bannon and Kushner had seemed joined at
the hip, this was part of their bond: an effort to disintermediate Flynn and his often
problematic message. A subtext in the White House estimation of Flynn, slyly insinuated
by Bannon, was that Defense Secretary Mattis was a four-star general and Flynn but a
three-star.

“T like Flynn, he reminds me of my uncles,” said Bannon. “But that’s the problem: he
reminds me of my uncles.”

Bannon used the general odor that had more and more attached to Flynn among
everybody except the president to help secure a seat for himself on the National Security
Council. This was, for many in the national security community, a signal moment in the
effort by the nationalist right wing to seize power. But Bannon’s presence on the council
was just as much driven by the need to babysit the impetuous Flynn, prone to antagonizing
almost everyone else in the national security community. (Flynn was “a colonel in a
general’s uniform,” according to one senior intelligence figure.)

Flynn, like everyone around Trump, was besotted by the otherworldly sense of
opportunity that came with, against all odds, being in the White House. And inevitably, he
had been made more grandiose by it.

In 2014, Flynn had been roughly cashiered out of government, for which he blamed his
many enemies in the CIA. But he had energetically set himself up in business, joining the
ranks of former government officials profiting off the ever growing globalist corporate-
financial-government policy and business networks. Then, after flirting with several other
Republican presidential candidates, he bonded with Trump. Both Flynn and Trump were
antiglobalists—or, anyway, they believed the United States was getting screwed in global
transactions. Still, money was money, and Flynn, who, when he retired, had been
receiving a few hundred thousand a year on his general’s pension, was not turning any of
it down. Various friends and advisers—including Michael Ledeen, a longtime anti-Iran

You can see that every program imaginable is generated in our
list. If you are wondering which version of Word or Excel, the answer
is every version and every bug ridden unreleased version as well. We
are enumerating every program that could ever be run in the known
universe!

Perhaps you can see a problem looming. Ican pose any mathematical
puzzle in a clever way so that a program only stops if there is a solution.
I am about to list every possible program that could ever be created. If
halt exists this will automatically prove every mathematical theorem
imaginable.

Let us see if this is so.

For our thought experiment, we will assume every program takes
an input. Historical convention in computing means this is generally the
case. If you type a program into the command line of a computer with
some words listed afterwards, the computer will usually run the program
with the words as input. For example, if you type, “Print “Hello World”,
most computers will print “Hello World.

We now imagine there is a Halt program that can run on an infinity
of inputs. Will it work for every input? We are looking for a paradox
caused by the existence of the Halt program. If Halt causes a paradox
then Halt cannot exist.

Here goes...

If there is a Halt program, we can write a Crash program. That’s a
program that goes into an infinite loop if it detects a program will halt.
Now what happens when we feed Crash into itself? Does Crash halt if it
runs with the input Crash?

This creates a paradox; there is no solution which makes sense. It’s
similar to the Barber Paradox of earlier. Since a paradox is created there
must be a fault in our original theory. The error is the existence of Crash.
Since Crash cannot exist and it was created as the logical opposite of
Halt, Halt cannot exist either. QED. There is no general program that will
tell if another program will halt because such a program could not run
with the negative of itself as input.

This places a limit on the power of computers to automatically
solve problems. There is certainly no general purpose algorithm which
will solve every problem. Slightly more subtly there is no general
purpose program that is guaranteed to solve one arbitrary problem.

Pardon the formality below - I want to approach your very legitimate questions / concerns in a serious
manner.
Attached and below the same.

Dear Jeffrey:

As requested, the following addresses your two questions / concerns about our proposed Closer To Truth TV
series “The Science of Sleep and Dreams”:

(i) Have there been sufficient breakthroughs in Sleep and Dreams (significantly beyond traditional
understandings) to justify a major TV series?

(11) Even if ‘yes’ to (1), is now the proper time for such a foundational series, or are more years needed for
corroborative studies and further research to solidify the breakthroughs?

In preparing this response, my primary source is Professor Patrick McNamara, Department of Neurology,
Boston University School of Medicine, with whom CTT Producer/Director Peter Getzels and I spoke with at
length today. Patrick is one of the leading sleep and dream researchers (he himself more dreams). More
importantly, he is perhaps the leading chronicler of the field, with many publications (including 26 entries in
related encyclopedias). He is co-editor-in-chief of the “Encyclopedia of Sleep and Dreams” (2012) and

the sole author of the forthcoming “An Introduction to the Neuroscience of Sleep and Dreams” (Cambridge
University Press, 2018), which intends to present the latest science and to become a main textbook for
graduate courses/seminars. Patrick is a CTT contributor and colleague.

When we asked Patrick, his first response — “This is the ideal time to tell the sleep-and-dreams story” — and he
cited (in essence) your two questions, in that (i) the multiple breakthroughs are now sufficiently well
corroborated by numerous independent labs such that a substantial foundation for the new, deeper
understanding of sleep and dreams is now for the first time (over the past few years) confirmed and
established, and (11) there are now interesting application and critical clinical questions to pose, explore and
pursue, such as for the treatment of various mental-related illnesses that have known sleep-related syndromes
(e.g., PTSD and Depression).

To understand the significance of recent breakthroughs, a defining characteristic of sleep and dreams is that
there are two distinct kinds of sleep - REM (rapid-eye-movement) Sleep and NREM (non-rapid-eye-
movement) Sleep. Most dreams are associated with REM sleep (though complex). The eye movement

gives the eponymous name, but a more important designation defines the two stages in terms of brain waves
(electroencephalograph — EEG): REM is Fast-Wave Sleep (similar to the waking state) and NREM Sleep is
Slow-Wave Sleep (very different from the waking state). This difference between REM and NREM sleep has
been known since 1953 (different EEGs since 1937), but its deep significance has only been discovered and
confirmed in very recent years (as explained below).

Following are the key areas of breakthrough in sleep and dreams (from Patrick). Patrick states that these are

As you are likely aware, the Department’s prior review of this matter was incomplete
and, by its own admission, not “de novo.” See Tab 38, May 15, 2008 Letter from A. Oosterbaan.
Without considering the Non Prosecution Agreement that left this matter to be resolved in the
State or any of the misconduct, CEOS reviewers, tasked with reviewing some of their own
previously expressed opinions, assessed only whether the United States Attorney would “abuse
[his] discretion” if he pursued this case. While we appreciate CEOS’s willingness to examine
these limited issues, its conclusion that a prosecution would not be an “abuse of discretion” rings
particularly hollow in light of CEOS’s admirably candid concessions that we have raised
“compelling” objections and that a prosecution on these facts would require “novel” applications
of federal law. Indeed, even a brief review of CEOS’s own mission statement reveals how
inapposite a federal prosecution is to the facts in this case.

Importantly, we note that the CEOS review was conducted prior to the Supreme Court’s
very recent decisions in Santos and Cuellar, which we believe—illuminating as they do the
Court’s interpretive methodology when it comes to federal criminal law—powerfully
demonstrate the substantive vulnerability of the USAO’s unprecedented employment of three
federal laws. That Office’s interpretation would never pass muster under the Supreme Court’s
recent pronouncements and should not be countenanced. That is all the more true under the
circumstances where the duly appointed U.S. Attorney opined that, in effect, the “unitary”
Executive Branch was driving this prosecution. We now know that is not so.

What I respectfully request, and what I hope you will provide, is a truly “de novo”
review—that is, an independent assessment of whether federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein is both
necessary and warranted in view of the legal and evidentiary hurdles that have been identified,
the existence of a State felony plea and sentence that have been advocated by the State Attorney
for Palm Beach County, and the many issues of prosecutorial misconduct and overzealousness
that have permeated the investigation. I also request that you provide us with the opportunity
during your review to meet with you in person to answer any questions you may have and to
elucidate some of the issues in our submission.

We believe that an independent review will confirm our strong belief that federal
prosecutors would be required to stretch the plain meaning of each element of the enumerated
statutes, and then to combine these distorted elements in a tenuous chain, in order to convict Mr.
Epstein. Indeed, just this week (and after two years of federal involvement in this matter),
Assistant United States Attorney Villafana re-initiated the federal grand jury investigation—in
direct contravention of the parties’ Non Prosecution Agreement—and issued yet another
subpoena seeking evidence in this case. See Tab 19, Subpoena to | In the
subpoena, AUSA Villafana directs MMMto appear on July 1, 2008 to give testimony
and produce documents to FGJ 07-103 West Palm Beach. The attachment to the subpoena seeks
documents such as photographs, emails, telephone billing information, and contact information

in my view potentially an unethical one, but I don't
think we need to get into that in this litigation.

What I saw was a stall tactic going on, and
the reason I think it was a stall tactic as we are
sitting here now in, what is it, October of 2015, and
Mr. Epstein has never been willing to answer questions
about his sexual abuse of these girls.

And this was back in around, what was it, I
guess it would be 2005, 2006, you know, roughly a decade
ago, Mr. Dershowitz was offering to make Epstein
available. And then that never happened and given the
ten-year pattern that -- I guess I should go back. I'm
sorry. Let me correct my answer.

We should go back to December 30th, 2014, so
there -- there appeared to be about an eight-year period
of time during which Mr. Epstein had refused to answer
any questions about his sexual abuse of girls and yet,
Mr. Dershowitz said, oh, it's just a scheduling issue
and we will get the Palm Beach Police Department to --
to -- to, you know, to meet and learn all this.

The other thing that that I'm seeing here, so
now there's -- there's -- Mr. Dershowitz had been
involved in concealing Mr. Epstein from the Palm Beach
Police Department, but there were others that had done

similar sorts of things.

9.6.2.2 Implications for AGI

What lesson should the AGI developer draw from all this? The particularities of the human
mind/body should not be taken as general requirements for general intelligence. However, it
is worth remembering just how difficult is the computational problem of learning, based on
experiential feedback alone, the right way to achieve the complex goal of controlling a system
with general intelligence at the human level or beyond. To solve this problem without some sort
of strong inductive biasing may require massively more experience than young humans obtain.

Appropriate inductive bias may be embedded in an AGI system in many different ways.
Some AGI designers have sought to embed it very explicitly, e.g. with hand-coded declarative
knowledge as in Cyc, SOAR and other GOFAI type systems. On the other hand, the human
brain receives its inductive bias much more subtly and implicitly, both via the specifics of the
initial structure of the cognitive cortex, and via ongoing coupling of the cognitive cortex with
other systems possessing more focused types of intelligence and more specific structures and/or
dynamics.

In building an AGI system, one has four choices, very broadly speaking:

1. Create a flexible mind-network, as unbiased as feasible, and attempt to have it learn how
to achieve its goals via experience

2. Closely emulate key aspects of the human body along with the human mind

3. Imitate the human mind-body, conceptually if not in detail, and create a number of struc-
turally and dynamically simpler intelligent systems closely and appropriately coupled to
the abstract cognitive mind-network, provide useful inductive bias.

4, Find some other, creative way to guide and probabilistically constrain one’s AGI system’s
mind-network, providing inductive bias appropriate to the tasks at hand, without emulating
even conceptually the way the human mind-brain receives its inductive bias via coupling
with simpler intelligent systems.

Our suspicion is that the first option will not be viable. On the other hand, to do the second
option would require more knowledge of the human body than biology currently possesses. This
leaves the third and fourth options, both of which seem viable to us.

CogPrime incorporates a combination of the third and fourth options. CogPrime’s generic
dynamic knowledge store, the Atomspace, is coupled with specialized hierarchical networks
(DeSTIN) for vision and audition, somewhat mirroring the human cortex. An artificial en-
docrine system for OpenCog is also under development, speculatively, as part of a project using
OpenCog to control humanoid robots. On the other hand, OpenCog has no gastrointestinal nor
cardiological nervous system, and the stress-response-based guidance provided to the human
brain by a combination of the heart, gut, immune system and other body systems, is achieved
in CogPrime in a more explicit way using the OpenPsi model of motivated cognition, and its
integration with the system’s attention allocation dynamics.

Likely there is no single correct way to incorporate the lessons of intelligent human body-
system networks into AGI designs. But these are aspects of human cognition that all AGI
researchers should be aware of.

Korea presumably plans to defend itself, should war erupt on the
peninsula, by threatening U.S. regional allies and targets in the United
States.

North Korea's mission requires small, lightweight warheads, and missiles
that work -- and the only way to know that they work is to test them. So
far, the weapons have proved unspectacular. The country's first nuclear
test, conducted in 2006, was an embarrassment. Pyongyang had told the
Chinese that the device would generate four kilotons of explosive power,
but it ended up producing less than one. The second test in 2009 fared
slightly better, producing between one and eight kilotons, although it is
not known what size of a blast the North Koreans had sought. Moreover,
Pyongyang has much more work to do before it can boast weapons that
will actually fit on its missiles (which have been, themselves, a series of
humiliating failures).

Observers in the West who presume that North Korea's behavior must be
about signaling should remember NATO and the United States' own
experience during the Cold War. The United States understood then that
the ability to conduct nuclear operations was the very foundation of a
credible deterrence strategy. Today, a sound strategy for dealing with
North Korea should not ascribe ulterior motives to acts that the United
States once considered rational and routine.

The view that nuclear weapons are merely political instruments -- suitable
for sending signals, but not waging wars -- is now so common in
Washington, London, and Berlin that it is hard to find anyone who
disagrees. Yet those comforting assumptions are not shared by leaders
everywhere. Beyond North Korea, Russia is cutting down its arsenal,
modernizing the nuclear forces it plans to keep, and increasing its reliance
on nuclear weapons in national defense strategy. China is slowly
expanding its own arsenal, while substantially improving its weapons.
And Iran seems so committed to going nuclear that it has been ready to
endure crippling sanctions and risk foreign attack.

It was common knowledge in Washington social circles that the

this view, the abstractness and hierarchical structure of representations is something of an
illusion, or at least an epiphenomenon. All the work can be done by association and
pattern detection—especially if there are enough data.

Over time, there has been a seesaw between this bottom-up approach to the
mystery of learning and Plato’s alternative, top-down one. Maybe we get abstract
knowledge from concrete data because we already know a lot, and especially because we
already have an array of basic abstract concepts, thanks to evolution. Like scientists, we
can use those concepts to formulate hypotheses about the world. Then, instead of trying
to extract patterns from the raw data, we can make predictions about what the data should
look like if those hypotheses are right. Along with Plato, such “rationalist” philosophers
and psychologists as Descartes and Noam Chomsky took this approach.

Here’s an everyday example that illustrates the difference between the two
methods: solving the spam plague. The data consist of a long unsorted list of messages in
your in-box. The reality is that some of these messages are genuine and some are spam.
How can you use the data to discriminate between them?

Consider the bottom-up technique first. You notice that the spam messages tend
to have particular features: a long list of addressees, origins in Nigeria, references to
million-dollar prizes or Viagra. The trouble is that perfectly useful messages might have
these features, too. If you looked at enough examples of spam and non-spam emails, you
might see not only that spam emails tend to have those features but that the features tend
to go together in particular ways (Nigeria plus a million dollars spells trouble). In fact,
there might be some subtle higher-level correlations that discriminate the spam messages
from the useful ones—a particular pattern of misspellings and IP addresses, say. If you
detect those patterns, you can filter out the spam.

The bottom-up machine-learning techniques do just this. The learner gets
millions of examples, each with some set of features and each labeled as spam (or some
other category) or not. The computer can extract the pattern of features that distinguishes
the two, even if it’s quite subtle.

How about the top-down approach? I get an email from the editor of the Journal
of Clinical Biology. It refers to one of my papers and says that they would like to publish
an article by me. No Nigeria, no Viagra, no million dollars; the email doesn’t have any
of the features of spam. But by using what I already know, and thinking in an abstract
way about the process that produces spam, I can figure out that this email is suspicious.

(1) I know that spammers try to extract money from people by appealing to
human greed.

(2) I also know that legitimate “open access” journals have started covering their
costs by charging authors instead of subscribers, and that I don’t practice anything like
clinical biology.

Put all that together and I can produce a good new hypothesis about where that
email came from. It’s designed to sucker academics into paying to “publish” an article in
a fake journal. The email was a result of the same dubious process as the other spam
emails, even though it looked nothing like them. I can draw this conclusion from just one
example, and I can go on to test my hypothesis further, beyond anything in the email
itself, by googling the “editor.”

Intensive coverage prompted by the court filings has hinted that Clinton abruptly ceased his flying with Epstein in 2005, not terribly
long before he was arrested, “perhaps because of events related to Epstein’s sexual abuse of children.” The implication is that
Clinton may have known trouble of the worst kind was coming and decided to get out while he could. In fact, the logs show all of

Clinton’s flights came in 2002 and 2003, with not a single appearance aloft recorded in 2004 or 2005.

The closest potential link to Clinton in the period closer to Epstein’s fall, the public record suggests, comes from one of his longtime

confidants, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.

The flight logs indicate Summers flew on Epstein’s jet as far back as 1998, but also on April 15, 2004, September 14, 2005, and
December 21, 2005. The final trip came 10 days after Summers got married, and the log for the flight — from Bedford,

Massachusetts, to the Virgin Islands — shows what appears to be his new bride on board, as well as Ghislaine Maxwell, but not

Epstein was a significant donor to Harvard University, of which Summers was president at the time. According to a spokesperson for
Summers, on a few occasions when Epstein was flying to where Summers was also traveling, he accepted rides on the billionaire’s

jet.

Attorneys in the two cases have attempted to get the court to permit discovery from Clinton himself, but have been stymied by
motions from Epstein’s lawyers. Court records show they have also tried unsuccessfully to depose Donald Trump, former New Mexico
Gov. Bill Richardson, former Sony Music head Tommy Mottola, and magician David Copperfield. Notably, a list of 73 proposed

witnesses in Roberts’ trial does not include Clinton.

The tale of Epstein and his sexual activities is undoubtedly a fascinating, and harrowing, one. But with the star witness in one case
swearing under oath that she has no such evidence, and everyone else in a position to know keeping their mouths firmly shut, it is at
this point extremely difficult to draw even a hazy, crooked, dotted line between Epstein’s depredations, in the bedroom or aloft, and

William Jefferson Clinton.

BuzzFeed News reporters Alex Campbell, Kyle Blaine, and Megan Apper contributed to this report.

TJP summary. Discussions suggest that it is more likely than not that there will
be a military attack on Iran in next 18 months. That is going to be very ugly.
Interestingly, polls suggest population and IR academics would not support such
an attack. Both Pawlenty — representing Romney, and Podesta — representing
Obama, presented a logic that — if followed, would lead to war with Iran. Logic
sitting in Aspen is fine, pulling the trigger 1s another matter.

Graham Allison. Two terrible choices, we should look for a third way.

Steve Hadley. Iraq was not a war of choice, it was a war of last resort when all

other options failed. Aug, 2013 we will be out of options on Iran. We do need

to think hard about our options and the sequencing of those options. Think in

terms of a f

family of options and the methods of moving through them.

1. Stop the clock, buy time. Iran has rejected this.

2. Put more on the table. More for more.

3. Secure the big agreement that ends dispute. Could the US agree to allowing
Iran to have a limited amount of LEU — say 3-5% enriched unranium.

4. Ifall of the above fails - what to do? US should try to establish a status quo
w redlines where, if Iran tries to break out, we have time to attack. We
would also want to understand Iran’s redlines.

5. Long term sanctions, pressure and isolation to try for regime change.

6. Limited military strike.

7. Big strike

unintended consequences. Therefore attack is very unattractive. Iran is close to a

"
IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028641.txt,"LEDA has been very successful. Of the 500 or so students who have graduated from the program, three quarters have gone
on to top-tier colleges, 30 percent of them to the lvy League. Among LEDA’s 2012 graduates alone, 19 gained admission to
Princeton, 11 to Georgetown and 6 to the University of Pennsylvania.

Last week | took a walk around Red Hook, Brooklyn, with Joshua El-Bey, a LEDA graduate who was leaving in a few days
for his sophomore year at Yale. His family struggled as he grew up, moving often and ultimately landing in the Red Hook
Houses, the borough’s largest public housing development. His first memories of book learning, he told me, were the
readings his mother delivered from Genesis when he was 2. What was disconcerting about Mr. El-Bey’s otherwise incredibly
inspiring trajectory was how much of his success had depended on opportunities outside the public education system.

Bullied in middle school for his studiousness, Mr. El-Bey hoped to gain admission to one of the city’s elite specialized public
high schools, but he did not do well enough on the entrance exam. The free tutoring provided by the city for the test was
insufficient, he said.

He ended up at Edward R. Murrow in Midwood, Brooklyn, a good school whose academics were nevertheless surpassed by
the supplemental training he received as a scholar at Sponsors for Educational Opportunity, an organization begun 50
years ago by Manhattan lawyers and advertising executives as a mentoring program to get poor minority students into good
colleges. Today it essentially provides a shadow education. In school, Mr. El-Bey told me, he simply learned to “regurgitate
facts.”

Programs like LEDA and S.E.O. are popular with wealthy, supremely educated donors, precisely because of outcomes like
Mr. El-Bey’s. Just this May, the financier Henry R. Kravis pledged $4 million in matching gifts to S.E.O.

And in acity as dense with talent and money as New York, the effects of such philanthropy can be effortlessly observed.
Walking through his neighborhood, Mr. El-Bey ran into another alumnus of S.E.O., Luis Hernandez, who was about to begin
his freshman year at the University of Southern California. In a precocious accomplishment more typical in other
neighborhoods, Mr. Hernandez had won a screenwriting contest for a film about obesity that had already made its debut on
the Showtime cable channel.

As a society we have begun to pay increasing and essential attention to gaining access to the top, but the brightest among
us might do well to apply equal focus to how we might enhance the middle.

Most students, rich or poor, will not go to Harvard, while plenty of working-class and poor students will go to colleges that
serve them not nearly well enough. Notlong ago, our son’s caregiver, who is taking classes at LaGuardia Community
College in Queens, showed me a paper she had written for a class in English composition taught by a teacher who was
consistently late and twice absent. It was on Ibsen’s “A Doll’s House” and my husband had helped her. It incisively analyzed
the play’s theme of 19th-century marital oppression and was impeccably written.

When our nanny received her grade, she was shocked not to have done as well as she had expected. Her formatting had
been imprecise, the teacher told her. And there was a problem with spacing. Content seemed not to matter much at all.

Obama goes for college ‘datapalooza’
Nick Anderson — Washington Post

In President Obama’s plan to overhaul higher education, which envisions using new federal ratings of colleges to determine
levels of student aid, there is a deep faith in the power of information and innovation to catalyze change in colleges and
universities.

Ultimately, the belief is that these forces will make college more affordable.

Yet academia has witnessed and taken partin many waves of innovation in the past half-century, and affordability remains
elusive.

The administration’s faith is encapsulated in a word the White House used this week in a fact sheet about the plan:

We are working on getting the following article placed in the Hill or the Politico within the next week. As of now it looks 
like former Chairman of Armed Services, Congressman Ron Dellums, will be the author. Please keep highly 
confidential. Will keep you posted on if, when and where it gets published. Once it is published we can all circulate it 
highly. We believe that this article sets the tone for the advocacy we will be doing and having someone very prominent 
like Congressman Dellums will also be a great way to launch this campaign. 
Congressman Ronald Dellums is a thirteen term Member of the U.S. House of Representatives (D-CA) who 
served from 1971-1998. He also served as the 48th Mayor of Oakland from 2007-2011. Dellums served as the 
Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and the House Committee on the District of Columbia. He 
also served on the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Post Office and Civil Service Committee, the Permanent 
Select Committee on Intelligence and co-founded the Congressional Black Caucus. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026836 
Senegal's Democratic Backslide 
2015 was a banner year for democracy in Africa. Nigeria, the largest country on the continent, had a 
democratic election, and even more impressively, had its first ever peaceful transition of power when sitting 
President Goodluck Jonathan transferred power to Muhammadu Buhari. Former President Jonathan conceded 
and famously declared, Nobody's ambition is worth the blood of any Nigerian. My last piece for The Hill 
was titled, 'Will Guinea's experiment in democracy succeed? It is with great joy that I can report that it 
did! Guinea's first democratically elected President, Alpha Conde, won his reelection campaign in a peaceful 
election that was internationally monitored in which the Guinean electorate reaffirmed its commitment to a 
democracy. 
Despite these victories for democracy in a continent in which I dedicated a great deal of my life's work, I am 
deeply troubled by developments over the last few weeks. Earlier this week Uganda President Yoweri 
Museveni extended his thirty year rule and won his fifth consecutive election which international observers 
said was marred with intimidation and impropriety. Shortly after the election Museveni, who scrapped 
constitutional term limits a decade ago, had his political rival, Kizza Besigye arrested and detained for 
protesting the election results. Of course we have come to expect these actions from Museveni in 
Uganda. What I am even most troubled by is what is taking place in Senegal, which was once the pillar of 
democracy in Africa. 
When Abdoulaye Wade was democratically elected as President of Senegal in 2000, it was a huge step 
forward for democracy in Africa. President Wade adopted a new constitution and instituted term limits for the 
first time in Senegalese history. In 2012 President Wade was defeated in a democratic election by his Prime 
Minister Macky Sall. The United States and the larger international community praised Wade for his quick 
concession and praised peaceful transition of power. President Macky Sall affirmed his commitment to 
democracy announcing that he would shorten term limits from 7 to 5 years. President Obama visited Senegal in 
June of 2013 and praised President Sall for his commitment to democracy in shortening the presidential 
mandate and praised the country's rule of law. 
Unfortunately in the past few years much has changed and we are witnessing a backslide in what was once 
Africa's brightest democratic success story. When the opposition party, the Senegalese Democratic Party, 
designated former President Abdoulaye Wade' son, former Minister Karim Wade, as their candidate for the next 
presidential election; President Sall had Karim Wade arrested and detained. President Macky Sall then 
reestablished a special court by presidential decree that had been abolished by Senegalese law and not heard a 
case in thirty years. This newly established special court sentenced Mr. Wade to six years in prison. He remains 
in prison today, sentenced without appeal. In April 2015, the United Nations Working Group of Arbitrary 
Detention determined that Mr. Wade was arbitrarily arrested and that his detention was in violation of 
international law. Last month the UN Working Group reaffirmed its finding and called on President Sall's 
regime to release Karim Wade and comply with international law. Sall has ignored the UN Working Groups 
request. 
Last week the backslide continued even further as President Macky Sall reneged on his commitment to shorten 
term limits. Instead of holding elections next year, after five years per his commitment, he announced that he 
would serve until 2019. He claims that this decision was based on the opinion - just an opinion - of the 
Constitutional Council that he had himself sought. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026837 
In light of the trend toward democracy in Africa as exemplified by Nigeria and Guinea, it is very concerning 
that one of the United States' closest allies and Africa's strongest democracies appears to be retrogressing. The 
destabilization of democracy in Senegal could have significant consequences in the entire region. The United 
States must get in front of this negative trend before spreads across Africa and it is too late. The U.S. should 
call for President Sall to honor the request of the UN Working Group and release his political rival Mr. Wade 
and also keep his pledge of a 5 year presidential mandate. President Obama has said that Africa is more 
important than ever to security and prosperity in the U.S. We have worked very hard in implementing and 
prioritizing democracy and democratic succession in Africa. The Obama administration must not let our hard 
work be compromised in Senegal, we have worked too hard and come too far.

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018703.txt,"﻿The Game: All Things Trump
Andres Serrano
In the history of science the collector of specimens
preceded the zoologist and followed the exponents of
natural theology and magic….. However lowly, the work
of the collector must be done, before he can proceed to
the higher scientific tasks of classification, analysis,
experiment and theory making.
Aldous Huxley from Heaven and Hell
Before Donald Trump was President, he was Donald Trump.
This is a portrait of that man.
In his first non-photography based installation, Andres Serrano
takes us on a curious and insightful tour for a closer look at who
Donald Trump is.
In a relatively short period of eight weeks with a determination
and competitive ferocity worthy of its subject, the artist has
amassed a collection of over 500 objects produced by or for
Donald Trump.
The collection is telling and varies from objects as mundane as
shirts, ties, suits, hats, jackets, ice buckets, Teddy Bears and
miniature screwdriver sets made for Donald Trump, his brand,
his casinos, his hotels, to Trump Tea, Trump Coffee, Trump Ice
Water, Trump Coca-Cola, Trump 7-Up, Trump Snapple, and
the more exotic $1,000 Trump Steaks (“The Best!”), Trump
Vodka packed in 24 carat gold plated bottles, a Trump deodorant
named “Success” and a Trump cologne called “Empire.”
In addition to the merchandise for Trump Plaza, Trump Harrah’s
Casino, Trump Marina, Trump Castle, Trump Tai Mahal,
Trump University and Trump Shuttle there are casino chips,
boxing invites, concert invites and many many more objects all
bearing the name “Trump.”
This colorful collection is mostly self-explanatory but the artist
plans to present each object with a museum-like label not unlike
in a curiosity cabinet or an anthropological study room.
Of particular interest are more than fifty magazines with Donald
Trump on the cover. Although, most of the magazines are ten,
twenty or more years old, there are some more recent ones
including a copy of The Atlantic from June 2016 with the cover
story, “The Mind Of Donald Trump,” Time Magazine’s issue
“Deal with it” from August 21, 2015 and another Time Magazine
dated March 14, 2016 with the words “bully, showman, party
crasher and demagogue” written across Donald Trump’s face.
All three magazines are signed by Donald Trump.
Also included are several high priced special edition items made
for VIP’s such as a beautiful Taj Mahal leather jacket and a Taj
Mahal Golf Bag and Clubs as well as a 1994 Trump Castle Casino
Birthday Invitation titled, “Trump, Lord Of The Financial Jungle.”
The centerpiece of the installation is a sizable portrait of Donald
Trump taken by Andres Serrano in 2004 for his “America” series
and a giant rotating sculpture below it. The sculpture, which is
more than 10 feet tall, is the word, EGO, spelled vertically, an
elegant sign that once greeted visitors at the entrance of Trump’s
Taj Mahal Casino's Ego Lounge.
Finally, there are several board games including “Trump
Monopoly,” “The Apprentice Game” and “Trump: The Game.”
The premise of “The Game” is stated on the box.
“It’s not whether you win or lose, it’s whether you win.”
There are different versions of “The Game,” including one in
French, all to be laid out in several locations in the gallery under
glass.
What kind of game was it, or is it? Who wins, and who loses?
That’s for the audience to decide. The artist prefers to stay neutral.
“It’s a portrait of a man painted with his own brushes,” says
Andres Serrano.

relate to plaintiff and said that those stories ar vidence of
her damaged reputation. When you look at the stories that

actually were pulled off the internet, a substantial number of

them relate to the Cassell-Edwards-—Dershowitz litigation; what

happened in the litigation, statements made by the parties in

the litigation, statements made about Virginia Giuffre relevant

to that litigation.
If her reputation is damaged by some other litigation
that has nothing to do with Ms. Maxwell, Ms. Maxwell can't be

responsible for that reputational damage.

THE COURT: What's your explanation of the damage

caused to Giuffre by the Dershowitz case?

MS. MENNINGER: I'm sorry?

7

THE COURT: I understand the testimony part. That's a

different kind of thing. But the case itself, how does that

damage her reputation?

MS. MENNINGER: It's the press attendant to that case,

your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay. So the press attendant.

MS. MENNINGER: There was a lot of press attendant to

that case which was, frankly, negative to the plaintiff that
had nothing do with Ms. Maxwell's denial. And their experts
have relied on that press and claimed that that press somehow
supports their claim for damages against Ms. Maxwell, even

though she's not mentioned in the particular stories.

the Alabama judicial building.)

For Bannon, the president’s political thinking had been obtuse at best. He was unlikely
to get anything from McConnell—and indeed Trump had demanded nothing for his
support for Luther Strange, which came via an unplanned tweet in August. Strange’s
prospects were not only dim, but he was likely to lose in a humiliating fashion. Roy
Moore was the clear candidate of the Trump base—and he was Bannon’s candidate.
Hence, that would be the contest: Trump against Bannon. In fact, the president really
didn’t have to support anyone—no one would have complained if he’d stayed neutral in a
primary race. Or, he could have tacitly supported Strange and not doubled down with
more and more insistent tweets.

For Bannon, this episode was not only about the president’s continuing and curious
confusion about what he represented, but about his mercurial, intemperate, and often
cockamamie motivations. Against all political logic, Trump had supported Luther Strange,
he told Bannon, because “Luther’s my friend.”

“He said it like a nine-year-old,” said Bannon, recoiling, and noting that there was no
universe in which Trump and Strange were actually friends.

For every member of the White House senior staff this would be the lasting conundrum
of dealing with President Trump: the “why” of his often baffling behavior.

“The president fundamentally wants to be liked” was Katie Walsh’s analysis. “He just
fundamentally needs to be liked so badly that it’s always ... everything is a struggle for
him.”

This translated into a constant need to win something—anything. Equally important, it
was essential that he /ook like a winner. Of course, trying to win without consideration,
plan, or clear goals had, in the course of the administration’s first nine months, resulted in
almost nothing but losses. At the same time, confounding all political logic, that lack of a
plan, that impulsivity, that apparent joie de guerre, had helped create the disruptiveness
that seemed to so joyously shatter the status quo for so many.

But now, Bannon thought, that novelty was finally wearing off.

For Bannon, the Strange-Moore race had been a test of the Trump cult of personality.
Certainly Trump continued to believe that people were following him, that he was the
movement—and that his support was worth 8 to 10 points in any race. Bannon had
decided to test this thesis and to do it as dramatically as possible. All told, the Senate
Republican leadership and others spent $32 million on Strange’s campaign, while Moore’s
campaign spent $2 million.

Trump, though aware of Strange’s deep polling deficit, had agreed to extend his
support in a personal trip. But his appearance in Huntsville, Alabama, on September 22,

26. This was a new product category that I created to eliminate and preempt the competition. Strive to
be the largest, best, or first in a precise category. I prefer being first.

27. If you decide to resell someone else’s higher-end products like Doug, especially with drop-
shipping, the risk is lower and smaller margins can suffice.

28. “Back-end” products are products sold to customers once the sale of a primary product has been
made. iPod covers and car GPS systems are two examples. These products can have lower margins,
because there is no advertising cost to acquire the customer.

29. “Cross-selling” is selling a related product to a customer while they’re still on the phone or in an
online shopping cart after the sale of a primary product has been made. For a full marketing and direct

response (DR) glossary, visit www.fourhourblog.com.
30. This also refers to owners of copyrights or trademarks.

31. Said casually and with confidence, this alone will get you through surprisingly often. “I'd like to
speak with Mr./Ms. X, please” is a dead giveaway that you don’t know them. If you want to up the
chances of getting though but risk looking foolish if they call the bluff, ask for the target mentor by
first name only.

32. I use this type of lead-in whenever making off-the-wall requests. It softens it and makes the
person curious enough to listen before spitting out an automatic “no.”

33. This answers the questions they’ll have in their head: “Who are you and why are you calling
now?” I like to be a “first-time” something to play the sympathy card, and I find a recent media
feature online to cite as the trigger for calling.

34. I call people ?'m familiar with. If you can’t call yourself a longtime fan, tell them that you have
followed the mentor’s career or business exploits for a certain number of years.

35. Don’t pretend to be strong. Make it clear you’re nervous and they’ll lower their guard. I often do
this even if I’m not nervous.

36. The wording here is critical. Ask them to “help” you do something.

37. Just rework the gatekeeper paragraph for this, and don’t dillydally— get to the point quickly and
ask for permission to pull the trigger.

38. End the conversation by opening the door for future contact. Start with e-mail and let the
mentoring relationship develop from there.

popular movement has emerged questioning its purpose and meth-
ods. As a result, a legitimate debate on what should constitute our
domestic liberties—and potential limits to those when facing sig-
nificant security concerns—has largely obfuscated in this mind-set
the reality of Snowden’s weakening, durably and structurally, the
critical ability of the United States and its allies to address their
mounting external security challenges. In this culture of distrust,
whatever contradicts the innocent whistle-blower narrative can be
preemptively dismissed because Snowden, even though he remains
ensconced in Moscow at an unknown location, remains the ultimate
truth teller.

I do not accept either this formulation of Snowden or his version
of the events in which he was the hero. Opening a Pandora’s box of
government secrets is a dangerous undertaking. Whether Snowden’s
theft of state secrets proceeded from an idealistic attempt to right a
wrong, a narcissistic drive to obtain personal recognition, an intent to
weaken the foundations of the surveillance infrastructure in which
he worked, or a combination of such factors, by the time he arrived

© in Moscow, it had evolved, deliberately or not, but necessarily, into ©
a mission of disclosing key national secrets to a foreign power. In
the end, such conjectures about Snowden’s motives matter less than
that he was helped, consciously or not, by others with interests that
differed from those of the United States. The effects on America of
such a massive breach of confidence might not easily be reversible.

1Q Internet Sector Preview
Earnings Preview Equity | 06 April 2017
Unauthorized redistribution of this report is prohibited. This report is intended for amanda.ens@baml.com
1Q Preview; Expectations building on a strong 2H
Our early sector preview highlights our estimates vs. Street, early 1Q data points, and
some opportunities for 1Q results for 30 stocks in our coverage group (more detailed
company previews to follow). For large-caps, Street 2017 EPS estimates are down 8%
YTD while the average stock price is up 9% YTD; suggesting macro and 2H optimism is
driving stocks, which could continue throughout earnings season. 1Q was not without
potential pressures, including ramping competition in several sectors and delayed tax
refunds. A key theme for the group, in our view, is advertising & listing ranking revenue
initiatives at eCommerce sites (AMZN, EBAY, EXPE), and we are constructive on all three
stocks. Per our Internet sentiment ranking screen (page 7), FB, WIX, TREE have best
sentiment while TWTR and TRIP have weakest.
A few early checks positive, mixed eCommerce data
Our early ad checks suggest robust overall demand, aided by somewhat easy comps vs
1Q’16, with Instagram momentum a standout. eCommerce is more mixed, with some
concerns on consumer spending due to delayed tax refunds, but optimism that spending
will rebound in March/April. In travel, there are modest concerns on pressure on US
inbound travel, a bigger negative for Expedia than Priceline. FX spot rates for both the
Euro and the Pound have depreciated 1% vs. the US$ since end of Jan.
Many key upcoming events for stocks in 2Q
Top events in 2Q include Facebook’s F8 developer conference on April 18-19, Google’s
Marketing Next keynote on 5/23, an AWS event in San Francisco on April 18-19,
expected closing Verizon’s acquisition of Yahoo, Netflix’s release of several key
franchise including House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, Sense8, Glow, and
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, consumer wide release of Pandora Premium, Expedia’s
new HomeAway disclosures and, possibly, Amazon’s new revenue disclosures.
We expect meet/beat EPS for several companies
We are above the Street on 2017 EPS for 16 of the 25 stocks discussed within and, of those,
we are most confident in Facebook & Priceline for 1Q upside potential. We expect Facebook
to benefit from robust traffic, Instagram momentum, and greater adoption of audience
targeting tools. We also think Priceline can beat 1Q given strong booking trends into the
quarter and a modest recovery in European travel. We are below the Street on 2017 EPS for
AMZN, TRIP, and YHOO. Expedia is a top eComm/travel idea for 2Q/3Q on potential for
accelerating room nights, HomeAway optimism, and less uncertainty on near-term estimates.
GOOG, AMZN & ZG interesting 1Q sentiment stocks
For large cap’s, we believe GOOGL has had high recent interest given controversy
around Youtube ad placements. We are not sure if Google will provide clarity on the
issue on their call, but we do expect advertisers to return by 3Q and any overhang to be
resolved. For Amazon, the company had new revenue disclosures in its 10-K filing, and
there is growing optimism on advertising being a positive bottom-line driver. In SMID
Internet, Zillow has more controversy going into 1Q as investors are once more
concerned about potential regulation by the CFPB limiting the ability of agents and
mortgage brokers to co-market on the platform. We remain positive on the stock due to
its dominant position in online real estate and our belief that the high ROI of the ad unit
(our survey suggested >6x return) will ensure that agents buy Zillow placements
regardless of mortgage broker incentives. Additionally, we see earnings upside potential.
BofA Merrill Lynch does and seeks to do business with issuers covered in its research reports. As a
result, investors should be aware that the firm may have a conflict of interest that could affect the
objectivity of this report. Investors should consider this report as only a single factor in making
their investment decision.

Currency still a slight headwind for 1Q results but improving
We expect FX to remain a y/y headwind for 1Q results; the Euro is down about 6% y/y
but up 1% from where it was when most Large-cap internet companies reported 4Q
results in late January (~$1.06). The GBP at $1.22 is down slightly (1.4%) over the same
period. Our currency strategist is forecasting the Euro to end 2017 at $1.05 and the
GBP to end at $1.19. FX pressure will ease after 1Q if rates hold, unless a company has
high exposure to Japan.

Sentiment Ranking Update
We are updating our sentiment ranking index on 25 stocks in our Internet coverage
universe (as of 4/4/17). We have aggregated six different indicators we think are
relevant to gauge sentiment and have generated an overall “sentiment” score for each
company. This sentiment analysis is intended to be informative and should not be used
to form an investment opinion; for example our model does not factor in valuation or
management quality. Of our company coverage universe, we have excluded four game
publisher companies as well as two recent IPO’s from this analysis as data may not be
comparable.

Investor sentiment categories
We assembled data that measures investor sentiment across six categories. These
metrics include latest short interest (as a % of float), change in short interest as a % of
float over the last 90 days, current stock performance over the last 90 days, current
average sell side ratings, forward year EPS estimate revisions over last 90 days, and
expected FY17 revenue growth. While there are no perfect indicators of average
investor sentiment, we believe these metrics provide a helpful framework of investor
sentiment in our sector. In our analysis, Facebook, WIX, and LendingTree had the highest
sentiment in 1Q, while Fitbit, Trip and Twitter had the lowest sentiment. Care.com had
the most improved ranking, moving up 9 points to 8 th , while Quotient had the biggest
decline moving down 10 spots in our ranking to 22 nd .
Methodology
Our methodology consisted of: 1) gathering financial data across six categories that we
believe are relevant to measuring investor sentiment, 2) ranking companies on each
attribute using a scale of 1 to 29, with 1 highest and 29 the lowest, and 3) ranking the
companies based on the avg. score of the six metrics.
8 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017
Highest sentiment: FB, WIX, and TREE; Lowest: FIT, TRIP, and TWTR
Based on our sentiment ranking index, Facebook, Wix, and LendingTree have top
investor sentiment pre 1Q earnings. Facebook moved into first place from fourth due to
the lowest short interest as % of float, second highest FY17 revenue growth, sixth
highest sell side FY16 EPS estimate revisions, and third best stock performance in the
last 90 days. Wix came in second place with top stock performance in the last 90 days,
top expected FY17 revenue growth and second best sell-side FY16 EPS estimate
revision, despite ranking ninth for current sell side ranking and seventh for short interest
ratio. LendingTree placed third with best current sell side ranking and best change in
short interest ratio.
Fitbit had third worst investor sentiment with the worst stock performance in the last
90 days, the worst expected FY17 revenue growth and the second largest change in
short interest in the period. TripAdvisor, had the second lowest sentiment with the third
worst sell side ranking and fifth worst sell side EPS estimate revision. Twitter, our
lowest sentiment stock pre 1Q earnings, had second to worst sell side ranking and
expected FY17 revenue growth, along with third to worst sell side estimate revisions
and was below average in all of our categories.
Score Ranking vs. Investment Rating
Our sentiment analysis is independent of our investment rating system, and our
investment rating may or may not factor in positive or negative sentiment. This
scorecard analysis includes only data currently up to the last 90 days, and our
investment rating opinion takes into consideration potential stock price fluctuations,
attractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within our Coverage Cluster,
business model quality, and valuation. Please see our Fundamental Equity Rating
Opinion Key at the end of the report for more details.

Alphabet (Buy, $1,025 PO)
Stock view: Expect solid 1Q revs., but loss of non-GAAP reconciliation a concern
New concerns have been raised on the YouTube advertiser pullback, but with the cuts in
spending surfacing primarily in the back half of March, we anticipate only modest
impact to 1Q revenue, with more significant potential impact to 2Q17 (see Advertiser
boycott raising concerns on 1Q/2Q revenues). Looking beyond the YouTube issues, our
early 1Q ad checks were mostly positive, with Merkle highlighting modest revenue
growth acceleration, better than the 70bps of ex-FX Website revenue deceleration in
1Q17 (vs 4Q16) we’ve assumed in our model. Overall, we expect in-line to slightly
better 1Q results driven by mobile and PLA strength (and perhaps some maps ads), but
see risk of moderate Street estimate cuts for 2Q/3Q revenue on YouTube concerns. For
most companies, we would expect management to help clear up the advertiser
controversy on the call with some added financial disclosure or guidance, but predicting
what Alphabet will say on the topic is more difficult.
1Q results will be the first quarter that Google reports GAAP EPS without a non-GAAP
EPS reconciliation. With higher than usual SBC in 1Q due to changes in grant timing, it
is possible Google misses Street GAAP EPS. We are leaving our revenue unchanged but
lowering GAAP EPS to $7.26 from $7.36 based on higher SBC. Also, unusual charges are
more likely to be controversial for Google without a non-GAAP EPS reconciliation.
Core margins remain a key focus, as has been the case since 3Q16 when core Google
non-GAAP operating margins contracted 95bps y/y. We expect core margins to remain
down y/y driven primarily by segment mix, and our model assumes 2017 core margins
are down 50bps in 2017 (to 46.1%) and another 20bps in 2018 (to 45.9%). For 1Q17,
we assume 45.8% core Google non-GAAP operating margin, up 30bps q/q and down
75bps y/y. Our recent deep dive analysis suggests segment mix alone drives a natural
220bps margin headwind, which we think can be partially offset with 1) upside in high
margin search growth from monetization growth (clicks and pricing); 2) leverage in
individual segments from scale; and 3) cost cutting measures across the business (see
Digging into the Alphabet revenue mix and margin drivers).
We continue to like the stock, but recognize that potential estimate trimming on
YouTube concerns, further margin contraction, SBC pressure on GAAP EPS and
challenging 2Q17 comps could continue to drag on near-term sentiment. Looking ahead,
we are optimistic on 2H17 based on the potential for new ad format ramps, easing
comps, and potential YouTube relief (we assume the advertiser boycott eases exiting
2Q). Alphabet trades at 22x GAAP (17x ex-Other Bets, cash), in-line with the S&P and
in-line to below the 5-year average (23.5x), which we view as attractive.
Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Website growth, core margins
We believe the key metrics for the quarter will be ex-FX Website growth and core
margins. For ex-FX website growth, we currently model 70bps of deceleration in 1Q17
(vs 4Q16), and we think deceleration could persist through 2Q17, after which the y/y
growth comps ease considerably.

For core margins, we assume y/y contraction through 3Q17, after which we model a
slight uptick in 4Q17. For the year, we assume core Google margins contract 50bps to
46.1%. In terms of blended Alphabet non-GAAP operating margins, we assume 70bps of
y/y contraction to 40.7% in 2017, but won’t be surprised if better cost discipline
(particularly in Other Bets) drives more stable y/y trends.

Source: Company, BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research
Biggest 1Q issues/risks:
• Deceleration in Google Website revenue: There could be modest revenue
pressure due to YouTube boycott impact, and/or ad shift to Facebook. One SEM
suggested a modest uptick in advertising spend on maps, which could be a positive
in 2017.
• TAC to distribution partners: Rising TAC rate (Apple, Samsung) could mitigate
potential gross revenue upside in the higher margin mobile search segment.
• Growth investments could drag on margins: Investments in Google Cloud,
hardware, and YouTube could be higher than we expect, which could negatively
impact core Google margins and raise concerns on long-term sustainable margin
levels.
• YouTube/Display Network commentary: While we do not expect full resolution on
the YouTube/Display Network issues, management’s tone will likely impact
expectations for timing of a fix, corresponding costs, magnitude of the boycott
losses, and time to recover lost ad spend.
• Stock comp timing shift could cause some GAAP lumpiness: Shift in timing of
annual stock-based comp grants could impact 1Q EPS, but should be offset with
lower relative cost in 2H17.
Top 1Q data point:
Our early 1Q checks (pre quarter end) have been mostly positive, but most checks did
not contemplate a potential impact of the YouTube & Display Network pullback.
ComScore PC click data has suggested Google PC queries are down 3% q/q QTD, slightly
worse than the 2% q/q decline in 1Q16.
12 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017
Estimate vs Consensus
Our revenue and EBITDA estimates of $20.2bn/$9.9bn are slightly above the Street at
$19.9bn/$9.8bn. Our model assumes currency to be a 2% headwind on y/y international
revenue in 1Q17 (similar to 4Q16) and a 3% headwind in 2Q17. Our 1Q17 non-GAAP
EPS of $9.53 is slightly above consensus at $9.45, and on a GAAP basis, our 1Q
estimate for $7.26 is slightly below the Street at $7.42. For 2017, we are above on
revenue, EBITDA, and non-GAAP EPS, but slightly below on GAAP EPS.

Given the recent YouTube & ad network concerns, it’s possible stock sees a lift on inline
EPS if commentary on content fixes and advertiser pullback is constructive. We are
comfortable with our $1,025 price objective, based on 21x core Google GAAP EPS plus
cash. Our PO multiple is within the five year range of 12-24x forward P/E. Easing
comps and potential new ad format ramps (Google’s advertiser conference is May 23)
could be positive 2H drivers.
Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 13
Amazon (Buy, $1,100 PO)
Stock view: Positive on retail, but street increasingly focused on advertising
For Amazon’s retail business, sentiment remains positive despite some modest 4Q
revenue weakness vs expectations. We expect the retail business to remain strong in
1Q with stable growth as core drivers (Prime, delivery infrastructure advantage) remain
intact. The lack of early tax refund support is a potential 1Q risk, but we would expect
any delayed spending to bounce back in March or 2Q. Continued store closures by
traditional retailers should aid the online shift throughout 2017. Finally, it appears
Amazon has become stepped up advertising on its site, with more sponsored listings,
which could be a source of revenue upside in 2017. Amazon had new revenue
disclosures in its 10-K, and the ad revenue line significant accelerated in 2016.
For AWS, we expect some additional q/q revenue deceleration and q/q declines in
margins. We note that AWS growth in 4Q was below our estimates, and the effects of
4Q’s late price cuts should drive additional deceleration in 1Q. Microsoft and Google
are well capitalized competitors that are significantly increasing cloud investment (see
Battle in Seattle for industry update), so the Street sentiment could shift more
cautiously on Amazon on a slight miss.
Margins continue to be a risk, but top line trends seem to be the biggest driver of
sentiment and advertising optimism has grown. Amazon’s current investment cycle
began in earnest in 3Q’16, and we expect the elevated pace of investment to persist
through 3Q’17. Margins may see y/y declines given: 1) Ongoing investments in
fulfillment center build out (given fulfilled unit growth of 40% in 2016), 2) Digital
content and related marketing, 3) Prime benefits (Now and Fresh), 4) Alexa/Echo, and 5)
India. We think the Street is constructive on these initiatives, and will move past lower
y/y margins concerns if top line growth is stable in 1Q.
Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: AWS growth and 2Q profit outlook
We forecast 43% y/y AWS growth in 1Q, down from 47% in 4Q, partially due to the
lingering effects of price cuts that went into effect on December 1 st . This implies 4%
q/q growth v. 9% last quarter. Increased investments in logistics/fulfilment, AWS,
marketing, Prime content and others could set Amazon up for disappointing margin
guidance vs. the Street’s expectations. However, we think the Street will focus on
revenue trends and ultimately view the investments as a long-term positives.
Biggest 1Q issues/risks:
• 2Q GAAP operating income outlook given increased investments in logistics, India,
Prime Instant Video content, as well as expected AWS deceleration
• Gross profit growth trends given expense issues and tougher growth comps in
1H17
• AWS margin trends given AWS price cuts and aggressive competition
• International segment performance given investments in India
1Q traffic data points mixed
comScore’s US data indicates that Amazon PC user growth has been down 2% y/y in 1Q
through February vs. 4Q at -5% y/y. Mobile user growth is up 8% y/y vs. up 9% in 4Q.
Amazon’s total mobile and PC minutes were down 5% y/y in 1Q through February vs. up
18% y/y in 4Q; mobile minutes were down 7% y/y in 1Q vs. +18% y/y in 4Q.
1Q items/news:
• Logistics investments: Amazon announced a $1.5bn air hub in Northern Kentucky
that will host Amazon’s own cargo airline.
• AWS outage: AWS had a large outage in early March. Investors will likely focus on
the competitive implications of the outage.

reports indicate that Amazon had bid $650mn for the company before Emaar Malls
made a public bid of $800mn. The deal is expected to close in 2017.
• Physical store rollout: Amazon has launched or planned to open 10 AmazonBooks
stores, is beta testing its AmazonGo grocery store concept (though public opening
was delayed due to technology issues), and there are press reports that Amazon is
testing other grocery store formats as well.
• Google Cloud Conference: No significant price announcements were made, but
Google’s conference was much more impressive this year (see What a difference a

Souq.com brings Amazon into the Middle East
Amazon announced that it has an agreement to acquire Souq.com, the leading
eCommerce platform in the Middle East. Terms were not disclosed, though press
reports indicate that Amazon had bid $650mn for the company before Emaar Malls
made a public bid of $800mn. This will represent Amazon’s largest deal since the
$970mn Twitch acquisition in 2014.
Souq.com does not disclose its sales or earnings, making it difficult to assess the
acquisition multiple or potential accretion of the deal. An $800mn acquisition implies
0.2% of Amazon’s current market cap. Though it is somewhat surprising for Amazon to
acquire a company in order to enter a new market, Amazon can leverage logistics,
sourcing, customer, and technology investments at Souq.com. The deal is expected to
close in 2017. Souq.com offers 8.4mn products across 31 categories, including
electronics, health & beauty, fashion, home goods, and baby. The site has 45mn monthly
visitors and localized operations in Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Egypt and localized sites for
the UAE, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, and Qatar. Euromonitor estimates
that Middle East & Africa GMV is $9bn market in 2016 though other reports peg the
market at $20bn, implying roughly 1-2% eCommerce penetration in the region vs. midteens
in Western markets. Press reports last year indicated that Amazon was exploring
entering Australia and Singapore in 2017. The Souq.com acquisition may signal a more
aggressive global expansion plan.
Estimates vs. Consensus: Above Street revenue and EPS
We expect 1Q revenue/EPS of $35.3bn/$2.34 vs. Street at $35.3bn/$2.28. Amazon’s 1Q
revenue guidance is $33.25-35.75 and GAAP operating income of $250-900 (we are at
$898mn in operating income). Our 1Q revenue estimate of $35.3bn (+21% y/y vs. 22%
in 4Q16) is based on 24% y/y unit growth vs. 24% y/y in 4Q. For 1Q17, we estimate
-19% q/q revenue growth vs -19% q/q in 1Q last year. We are below the street for 2Q
margins.

Our PO of $1,100 is based on our SOP that values AWS at $127bn or $259 per share
and the retail business at $413bn or $841 per share. Our 5.5x AWS multiple is a modest
premium to the software/SaaS comp group at 5.0x on 2018 sales, and 0.9x multiple is a
premium to a retail general merchandise comp group at 0.7x. We think the premiums are
warranted given share gains and superior growth. Our $1,100 price objective implies
2.8x 2018E Price/Sales, a multiple above the high end of Amazon's historical range of
1.0-2.5x. We argue the historical P/S multiple should increase given positive 3rd party
sales (3P) that is reported on a net basis, a higher AWS revenue contribution, an
increasing advertising contribution, and record gross profit margins.
16 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017
eBay (Buy, $38 PO)
Stock view: Marketplace growth should improve in 2017
eBay’s 4Q results showed signs of Marketplace improvement, with improving mobile
and C2C trends and a modest pickup in new buyers. Management expects to put
marketing dollars behind this trend to drive Marketplace growth momentum in 2017
(guidance calls for 1 point of acceleration in Marketplace volume in 1Q, with 2 points for
the full year). Expectations have risen since the start of the year, and we think eBay
needs to deliver 1 point acceleration in US GMV growth vs 1Q to maintain confidence in
management’s execution. There is also significant interest in eBay’s first party ad
strategy and potential improvement in transaction take rates (at expense of MS&O
revenues).
The potential structured data impact also remains top of mind for investors as
structured data will provide the backbone for improving customer search and product
experiences. As of 4Q’16, there are 180mn+ structured data pages v. 100mn+ pages at
the end of 3Q’16. More pages are expected in 2017, which will start to be exposed to
core organic traffic. Management appears confident that the impact of structured data
would increasingly benefit results and that structured data formats will be much more
visible by holiday 2017. Overall, if 1Q results are at/above expectations, we think the
stock will reflect even more optimism on structured data improvement.
For margins, we expect continued pressure in 2017 as the company ramps up marketing
spend and increases its AI capabilities. If the company can manage to accelerate top
line growth through conversion rate improvements, some of the upside may be invested,
limiting 2017 earnings flow through (but benefitting growth in 2018). Therefore, we
think customer, transaction and revenue trends most important for 2017, but lack of
margin flow through could be sentiment headwind for the stock.
Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Marketplace growth/outlook
Our model assumes US GMV growth of 3.5% y/y, an 80bps q/q acceleration off an 80ps
easier y/y comp, while we anticipate 6.0% y/y Intl ex-FX GMV growth. US acceleration
(despite a modest Leap Year headwind) is likely needed to maintain increased
management confidence. Our model assumes 8.3% take rate, which is up 10bps y/y and
could be aided by the early transition to 1 st party advertising on the site. eBay’s 1Q
revenue guide implies 5% y/y ex-FX growth at the midpoint, while the 2017 revenue
guide calls for 7% ex-FX growth, implying revenue growth acceleration during the year.

Biggest 1Q issues/risks:
• Overall GMV growth remains muted as structured data changes still early, reducing
confidence in future improvement.
Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 17
• StubHub trends as StubHub GMV comps are tough in 1H’17 (32% y/y growth in
1H’16).
• Marketing expenses are expected to increase, putting pressure on margins and
could raise concerns that GMV growth is being “bought”.
Early 1Q traffic data points mixed
comScore’s eBay desktop unique visitors decreased 6% on average through February vs.
down 2% in 4Q. comScore’s total eBay mobile and PC minutes declined 20% y/y on
average through February in 1Q vs. down 17% y/y in 4Q. comScore indicates mobile
minutes decreased 38% vs. down 20% in 4Q.
Estimates vs. Consensus: Expect modest EPS upside
We expect eBay to report broadly in-line revenue/EPS estimates of $2.21bn/$0.49 vs.
the Street at $2.21bn/$0.48 (guidance is $2.17bn-$2.21bn and $0.46-$0.48). Our model
assumes 11mn shares repurchased in 1Q (about $350mn of repurchase activity). We
have adjusted our GAAP EPS for higher amortization of deferred tax asset.

Our $38 price objective is based on 17x our 2018E non-GAAP EPS. O ur 17x P/E
multiple is slightly ahead of the retail comp group average of about 16x, reflecting
eBay's potential for a Marketplace growth acceleration (to well above average retail
growth) in 2017. With 6-8% growth and an 8% FCF yield, we think eBay remains an
interesting value stock for retail investors, although GARP focused Internet investors
may prefer stronger growth at Google or Priceline.
18 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017
Expedia (Buy, $146 PO)
Stock view: 1Q faces tough comps, but should clear way for strength into ‘18
We think 1Q expectations are somewhat muted as Expedia has highlighted several
earnings headwinds in early 2017, including incremental cloud migration spend, higher
marketing spend and, recently, potential ADR pressure. 1Q’17 earnings will face the
toughest room night growth comps, though Expedia expressed optimism on trends
through January on the 4Q call. Comps ease during the rest of the year for Expedia,
which we see as a positive set up for the stock. We think Expedia will reiterate its 10-
15% EBITDA growth outlook and .Expedia remains our top 2017 summer (2Q/3Q) travel
idea.
We currently forecast 20% y/y room night growth in 2Q/3Q, though the comp is
1600bps easier vs. 1Q and street growth expectations could be higher. The ongoing
benefit of conversion rate improvements, the Easter shift into 2Q (noted as 1% impact
in 2Q’16), as well as the benefit of more aggressive marketing spend should aid 2Q
growth. Additionally, prior to 1Q’17 earnings, Expedia will begin to disclose HomeAway
online bookings and room nights, which we think may drive y/y room night growth 200-
300bps higher (we forecast HomeAway room nights up 50% y/y in 2017 vs. core OTA
room nights up 18%). We think investors will also view HomeAway disclosure positively
if the data indicates that the HomeAway transition remains on track and provide
visibility into potential EBITDA acceleration in 2018.
STR data suggests hotel fundamentals deteriorated modestly in the US through initial
March readings, but improved slightly in Europe through February. However, Expedia’s
CEO commented in a recent interview with the Financial Times that international
tourism to the US (Expedia’s key market) has decelerated following the introduction of
Trump’s travel bans, which may be a downside risk to 1Q bookings and revenues. This
mirrors ForwardKeys data from early March that after Trump’s executive order, foreign
tourism bookings to the US fell, then rebounded when the ban was suspended, but
declined again when the ban was re-introduced. A few US hotel operators have
indicated little impact from travel bans, so data is mixed.
Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: room night growth vs industry and Priceline
We expect 1Q organic room night growth to remain steady at 16% y/y, though we note
that this does not yet include the contribution from HomeAway, which we think should
add 200-300bps to y/y growth. We expect N. America bookings growth of 12% y/y vs.
8% in 4Q, Int’l bookings (FX-neut.) of 14% y/y.
Biggest 1Q issues/risks:
• Room nights may disappoint on tougher 1Q comps, negatively impacting the
acceleration thesis
• Expedia’s CEO commented in a recent interview with the Financial Times that
international tourism to the US (Expedia’s key market) has decelerated following
the introduction of Trump’s travel bans, which may pressure hotel ADRs and be a
downside risk to 1Q bookings
• Pace of investments, namely cloud IT spend ($110mn in 2017) and marketing ramp
• HomeAway EBITDA trends given marketing spend ramp and pressure on
subscription revenues. Street has high expectations for the business.
• Pressure on hotel take rates given agency mix shift and rewards programs
Early 1Q RevPAR data decelerates
According to STR, 1Q US RevPAR through initial March readings decelerated 30bps to
3.0% y/y, and European RevPAR through February accelerated 600bps q/q to 3.6% y/y
Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 19
(FX-neutral). The STR data reflects a continued gradual deceleration in US RevPAR
growth and a more recovery in European RevPAR growth as the region laps terrorist
attacks and geopolitical uncertainty.

8% core OTA growth, 48% Trivago growth (in USD), 2% Egencia growth, and 16%
HomeAway growth. We expect room night growth to remain stable at 16% in 1Q’17

10-15% and our 2017 EBITDA forecast of $1.86bn (15% y/y growth) is modestly above
the Street at $1.83bn (14% y/y growth).

Facebook (Buy, $165 PO)
Stock view: Becoming the one-stop social shop
We expect Facebook to report upside to Street 1Q revenue (but less in absolute dollars
than in 4Q) driven by robust demand, Instagram momentum, and solid underlying user
growth and engagement. Early ad checks in the quarter indicate steady advertiser
trends, with some elements of seasonality off a stronger 4Q, and strength at Instagram.
We expect pricing tailwinds to begin to pick up as we approach ad inventory supply
moderation in 2H17, and a flurry of new product introductions could provide additional
sources of ad load inventory over time. Overall, we see 1Q as an in-line to slightly better
quarter, and are optimistic on the set-up for the remainder of the year for pricing,
expense management, user engagement, and new platforms/feature ramps. Facebook
will be hosting its F8 developer conference before earnings in San Jose on April 18-19.
Facebook had another busy quarter of new product launches with a notable trend of
Snapchat-like features (Stories, Direct ephemeral messaging) and Video. At this point,
we believe the Snap threat is less of a near-term concern. Recent key product/feature
releases include:
• Stories for all: On the tail of a successful Instagram Stories launch in 8/16,
Facebook rolled out WhatsApp Status (2/17), Messenger Day (3/17), and Facebook
Stories (3/17).
• Direct ephemeral messaging: After introducing ephemeral direct photo/video
sharing on Instagram in 11/16, Facebook announced a comparable feature with
integrated filters/masks/frames for the core Facebook app in 3/17.
• Video App for TV: Announced in February, new app for Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV,
and Samsung Smart TV to enable FB video viewing on TV.
• New ad products: Instagram Stories ads (1/17) a positive tailwind to Instagram ad
load, while vertical video ads (Facebook 9/16, Instagram 11/16) and Collections
(3/17) are likely positive for pricing.
While, in many ways, Facebook is duplicating Snapchat’s innovation, we are encouraged
with the rate of new product introductions and view the Facebook Stories and Direct
ephemeral messaging (with filters/masks) as positives for user engagement and
potential barriers to competitive risk. While management’s focus in the near-term will
likely be on new feature adoption, we expect Stories ads within 1-2 quarters and the
company is already establishing partnerships for branded masks/filters (see More
Stories in the Snap competitive saga). Over time, we would not be surprised to see
filter/mask features and ads added to WhatsApp and, possibly, Messenger, which could
unlock new monetization potential.
On the expense front, we continue to view management’s 2017 expense growth
forecast (47-57%) as conservative. History would seem to suggest manage could trim
the top of the range on the 2Q earnings call, with more meaningful revisions in 2H17.
That said, we won’t be surprised if management maintains the outlook on the April call,
particularly given the velocity of new feature launches and potential investments in
video content.

Source: Company, BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research
Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q
Underlying MAU and DAU trends are still the key metrics for the stock, in our view. We
assume MAUs grow 16% y/y to 1.91bn and DAUs 16% to 1.26bn, keeping DAU/MAU at
a steady 66%. It’s possible (but hard to predict) that management offers an update on
Instagram users (600mn MAU, 400mn DAU in 4Q), and more specifically, Instagram
Stories (150mn DAU in January). On the messaging front, there could be a Messenger
user update (1bn as of 7/16), while a WhatsApp update is less likely (1.2bn as of 4Q16).
We expect ad impressions to grow 46% y/y (49% in 4Q) and ad prices to increase 2%
y/y (3% in 4Q).
Biggest 1Q issues/risks:
• Expense trajectory or lack of an expense guidance change could disappoint:
While we continue to anticipate favorable revisions to management’s 2017 expense
forecast in 2H, near-term adjustments may be less likely given the velocity of new
product launches and potential video content investments.
• 1Q ad revenue deceleration possible: We note that 4Q was particularly strong
and it’s possible 1Q normalization could result in revenue growth deceleration.
• Lack of commentary on monetization strategy: While Messenger/WhatsApp
monetization is likely still a 2018 story, lack of constructive commentary on timing
could disappoint.
• User deceleration always a risk: MAU and DAU growth has surprised to the upside
at mid-to-high teens y/y growth, and any meaningful slowdown could raise
competitive concerns.
Top 1Q data point: Instagram reaches 1mn advertisers
Mid-quarter data points were somewhat limited in 1Q, though management did give an
update on the Instagram monetization efforts. In a March 2017 update, management
indicated that Instagram grew to 1mn advertisers, double the number since 9/16, with
business profile pages up to 8mn from 5mn in 4Q. Facebook’s comparable metrics are
4mn advertisers (as of 9/16) and 65mn business pages (4Q16).
For early advertiser checks, general feedback suggested positive trends, but more
‘steady as it goes’ than absolute blow out. The stronger 4Q was highlighted as a tough
22 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017
comp, but overall demand remains robust. Instagram feedback was notably positive,
with many suggesting the demand is additive (not reallocation from core Facebook).
Estimates vs Consensus
Our 1Q17 and 2Q17 revenue and EBITDA estimates are ahead above the Street. We
assume ~800bps of advertising growth deceleration in 3Q and another ~400bps in 4Q,
and our 2017 estimates are also slightly above consensus. On that premise, we are
comfortable that Street estimates sufficiently reflect potential impact of News Feed ad
load deceleration in 2H17.

GrubHub (Buy, $49 PO)
Stock view: Marketing ramp should drive diner growth re-acceleration
In recent quarters, GrubHub has been leveraging a series of recent investments,
including expanded delivery, more restaurants on the platform, repositioned brand
driving more effective advertising, and product optimization, which is driving higher
conversion rates. We think GrubHub is well-positioned to continue to leverage these
investments to drive growth in 2017 and beyond.
GrubHub’s delivery business is reaching scale in more markets, and delivered gross food
sales run-rate increased from $500mn in 3Q to nearly $600mn in 4Q (20% of ’16 food
sales). Delivered orders were 40% higher than in 3Q. We think delivery will continue to
drive take rate higher and be EBITDA accretive by YE17 as efficiencies are gained.
Competition remains a key concern for investors and weighs on sentiment. However, we
believe that GrubHub’s user base is sticky and its repeat order rate (>90%) is defensible.
In 2016, as UberEats, Amazon Prime Now, DoorDash, and Postmates invested in
expansion, GrubHub’s active diner growth and order growth remained solid. Google
Trends indicates that over the past 12 months, though competitors have expanded to
more cities in the US, GRUB remains the overwhelming leader in the market, with both
of its core brands (GrubHub and Seamless) many times the size of any of its
competitors.
GrubHub 1Q results may also face a modest growth headwind from warmer weather in
key markets like NYC and Chicago. For context, in 4Q15, GrubHub called out warmer
weather was a 200bps y/y order growth drag (~$2mn in revenue, $12.7mn in gross food
sales). Warmer weather can impact order volume and new diner growth, though new
diners can partially shift to 2Q. We forecast 26% y/y gross food sales and 36% y/y
revenue growth in 1Q’17.
We think active diner growth will accelerate in 2017 as the company invests more
heavily in marketing and it comps out against its “quality over quantity” marketing
strategy started in 1Q16. Investors, however, should expect that accelerating active
diner growth will be counterbalance by lower order frequency as newer diners to the
system tend to order less frequently. At the same time, we expect take rate will
continue to expand as the delivery business grows.
Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: gross food sales growth
We forecast gross food sales growth in 1Q of 26%, a modest deceleration from 27% in
4Q (flat with 4Q less the 1% hit from the lack of Leap Day in 1Q17). Though we think
there is likely upside to our forecast given a 500bps easier y/y comp in 1Q vs. 4Q. We
expect 1Q active diner growth of 25%, Grubs per Diner decline of 3%, and average order
size growth of 5%.
Biggest 1Q issues/risks:
• Despite positive Google Trends data and commentary from management, mounting
competition eats away at GRUB’s growth and take rate, driving diner acquisition
costs higher.
• Warmer weather during 1Q, particularly in GrubHub’s core NYC and Chicago
markets, may be a headwind to growth.
• RDS (restaurant delivery service) investments weigh on earnings at a rate higher
than the $3mn in EBITDA drag that we have in our model for 1Q’17.
• Site and conversion rate improvements turn out to be one-time in nature rather
than an ongoing, longer-term focus for management.
24 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017
• Marketing expense expected to ramp in 2017, which can weigh on earnings,
especially if gross food sales comes in weaker than anticipated.
Estimates vs. Consensus: Broadly in-line with consensus in 1Q’17
We expect 1Q revenue/EPS at $153mn/$0.25 vs. the Street at $153mn/$0.24 driven by
gross food sales growth and an improving take rate.

Our PO is $49, based on 32x our 2018E P/E (vs. high growth internet at 31x). We believe
GRUB warrants a premium to eCommerce peers due to the attractive margins of the
core business and, relative to the overall small-cap sector, GRUB has more attractive
margins and growth potential.

Match.com (Buy, $21 PO)
Stock view: Positive on Tinder monetization growth on new products
Match has continued to build monetization on Tinder and we expect a more widely
released Tinder Boost as well as international marketing spend to have a positive impact
in 1Q17 results. The incremental revenue increase combined with Core enhancements
should drive ARPU forward, though we are still cautious given Core’s declining to flat
growth and project 1Q17 at $.0.57 (-3% y/y).
Another issue on the horizon for Match group is the high ownership percentage of IAC.
Based on our discussions with management, this is a known issue from both Match and
IAC’s perspective. The high degree of IAC ownership limits the float and has created a
disproportionate short interest on the company to obtain higher exposure to IAC’s core
(ex-Match) properties. Our conversations suggest we can expect further discussion
from management on ways forward in 2017, with the most likely outcome, in our view, a
spin off IAC’s Match ownership to IAC shareholders.
As Tinder expands, one concern we have is that its highly diverse user base could cause
an overload of options and limit user’s ability to find the type of matches they are
looking for. An “elite” version of the app was recently launched called “Select” (per
TechCrunch), highlighting the company’s focus on making sure users are able to find
suitable matches in different ways.
1Q17 should see international marketing spend on Tinder begin to pay off. We expect
that paid member count (PMC) will continue to trend up driven by Tinder and other
recent platforming initiatives helping to increase conversion on Core mobile and other
sites like Plenty of Fish (PoF) and Meetic.
Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: International PMC growth
Key for the quarter will be international PMC growth and we expect international to
grow 25% y/y to 2.3mn and overall PMC growth to be up 17% y/y to 5.9mn as Tinder
marketing outside of the US should start paying off. We are still cautious on ARPU and
expect modest declines of 3% y/y, we believe there is still upside potential here driven
by Tinder Boost, released in September 2016 and Core turnaround efforts. Key issues
for the call will be PMC growth, Tinder monetization and Core improvements.
Biggest 1Q issues/risks:
• Decline in margins due to increased marketing of Tinder and Core improvement
• Drop in monetization as more consumers switch to mobile from PC.
• New investment initiatives drive down FY17 earnings projections.
Estimates vs. Consensus: Expect lower revenue, slight beat on profit
We are modeling rev/EBITDA of $293mn/$78.5mn below the Street due to impact of
Princeton Review sell off but higher on EBITDA vs. the Street’s $307mn/$77mn
estimate. We estimate total PMCs of 5.9mn in 1Q and average revenue per users of
$0.527 down 3% y/y due to lower monetizing Tinder plans. With the sale of Princeton
review closing 3/31 and management moving any income to discontinued operations,
we have removed all non-Dating revenue from our model and believe our treatment of
these discontinued operations (totally excluded from our estimates) is the reason our
estimates are currently below the street.

Netflix (Buy, $154 PO)
Stock view: Easy comps ahead with more content on the way
Heading into 1Q earnings, we expect Netflix to beat subscriber estimates given strong
recent content launches, and accelerating subscriber growth in Europe. Key 1Q titles
included A Series of Unfortunate Events, 13 Reasons Why, and Marvel’s Iron Fist. We
see few competitive issues this quarter to impact subscriber growth and we think the
release of Marvel’s Iron Fist likely helped quarter ending subscribers, despite low
metacritic scores. Fans of the Defender series still seem to be watching the show with
Parrot Analytics indicating viewership was just below Luke Cage its first week (though
viewership dropped by half within the first 10 days). In addition, fan ratings came in at
81% on Rotten Tomatoes despite the poor critic reception.
For 2Q, we expect a solid guide as Netflix laps 2Q16’s price increases internationally
and in the U.S. This should help churn rates for 2Q especially in Europe where we think
the bulk of Netflix subscriber growth will originate for 2017. In addition, Netflix has a
stronger slate of titles vs. 1Q including key franchises like House of Cards, Orange is the
New Black, Sense8, and other new series. Although competition is increasing in the
SVOD space with Amazon, Hulu and other making original content, we still see Netflix as
ahead of the competition due to: 1) sheer volume of content production with over 1000
hours in 2016, with strong local market content that can be leveraged globally, 2)
competitive price points vs competitors; and 3) the largest volume of 4K content which
attracts new TV purchases. 4K TVs could drive upside to estimates in FY17 as Netflix is
one of the few services with a library of 4K content.
For 1Q contribution margins, we estimate that Netflix will reach a new high at 41.3%
U.S. contribution margins somewhat offset by international contribution margins which
we expect to close to zero at 1.5%, but still a large improvement over 4Q’s 8% loss. We
expect Netflix to run its International division at new break even margins through FY17
and begin to gradually lift international margins in 2018. As Netflix reaches Intl
profitability, the investor story may focus more on EPS growth in the coming years.
Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Net sub adds internationally and 2Q guide
For 1Q we see two critical metrics that we think the Street will focus on; 1) Net Intl.
subscriber additions as Netflix laps the launch in 130 countries globally; and 2) 2Q net
subscriber guide for Netflix in the U.S. Although 1Q domestic subscriber ads are
important, we think the Street would be willing to look past a lower domestic number on
stronger international growth. In 2Q Netflix could potentially hit a flat subscriber
growth quarter as 2Q is typically seasonally weak, though we note the content slate for
2Q16 has several top franchises with new seasons.

Biggest issues/risks:
• Low reviews scores on Iron Fist effecting fan churn and causing some to question
Netflix’s ability to continue creating hit series
• Marketing spend in 1Q to drive subscriber growth
• Lower than expected contribution margins as Netflix invests in content.
• Content spending impact on FCF
Top 1Q data points: Traffic gains on PC
In the U.S., comScore reported quarter to date (Jan. and Feb.) average unique desktop
visitors up down 2% y/y to 40.5 million compared to 4Q up 22% y/y or 47 million, while
mobile unique users were flat y/y at 29.4mn users vs. up 19% y/y in 4Q. We note recent
comScore changes heavily impacted the y/y comparable data for several companies
including Netflix, in addition Comscore Data is PC only which is likely less relevant given
that a large portion of Netflix viewing is through connected TVs/devices.
Estimates vs. Consensus: In-line on revenue, slightly below on EPS
Our 1Q rev/GAAP EPS estimates of $2.71bn/$0.39 are above the Street’s estimates of
$2.64bn/$0.37. We estimate total domestic subs of 51.1 million, domestic DVD subs of
4 million, and international streaming subs of 48.3 million. Netflix a solid line up of
popular content in 2Q, especially May where it has Sense8 Season 2, Unbreakable
Kimmy Schmidt Season 3, War Machine (Movie), House of Cards Season 5 in May, and a
remake of Anne of Green Gables and Orange is the New Black in June which will likely
help U.S. domestic subscriber total stay positive in 2Q. In addition, we expect lower y/y
churn rates to potentially help subscriber growth.

Pandora (BUY, $9 PO)
Stock view: Focus on on-demand product, but questions on growth
Pandora’s recently launched on-demand subscription product will likely be the focus of
1Q investor call. Although the product is on limited release, we expect investor to focus
on initial reception of the product (positive reviews in media) and whether Pandora is
capable of growing the subscription base to 10mn over the next several years. Initially
Pandora will not likely see an impact on revenue from premium subscriptions as it is
giving current Pandora One subscribers a free six month trail of Pandora Premium which
may also impact subscription revenue for 1Q.
From our initial time with Pandora Premium, we found playlist creation smooth and easy
to use with Pandora quickly auto-filling play lists after picking a few songs, but Pandora
lacks the curated playlist selection found in Apple music and Spotify and we
encountered some missing songs/artists from the on-demand platform. The real
question will be whether Pandora’s platform is 1) good enough to pull exiting ondemand
users from other services to Pandora (Pandora indicated roughly 60% of
Pandora users are using another on-demand service); 2) can it convince people to
upgrade from free Pandora to Pandora Premium; and 3) how will Pandora grow its active
listener base from here. Pandora has had a largely stagnate active user base over the
last year and we think even with the new on-demand product could face difficulty
growing its users, especially as it increases its ad loads in key markets.
Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Ad rate growth and sub metrics
Pandora began rolling out Pandora Premium on March 15 th , and we think key questions
for the call will be; 1) initial reception of Pandora Premium; 2) when it will be fully
available to all users; 3) will Pandora Premium driving increased users; and 4) how have
ad load changes be received by free users. Pandora is increasing its ad load per hour to
increase its RPM rates, but this also risks alienating its already stagnant to declining
user base from the platform. 1Q will be the first measure to see if Pandora is able to
increase ad loads while maintaining its user base, the first step in stronger monetization
of its differentiated ad-supported radio product.
Biggest 1Q issues/risks:
• Investment spending in quarter and outlook for future S&M/R&D spend;
• Outlook for when Pandora will reach profitability again.
• Active listener or listening hour declines due competition;
• Commentary on outlook for Pandora Premium
Top 1Q data points: Triton Internet radio data
Triton media releases Internet radio metrics which give an initial read into the quarter,
but is limited to January data, Triton data shows Avg. Active sessions (analogous to
listening hour growth) declined 3% y/y which is tracking below our 1% y/y listener hour
growth est. of 5.58 billion hours. Session starts were up 4% y/y above our est. of 1% y/y
active user growth. We note that Spotify is now tracking more session starts than
Pandora implying market share loss to Spotify. Given the leap year, we would expect
February to track down Y/Y for monthly active listeners and user growth in February.
Estimates vs. Consensus: Slightly above on revenue, below on EPS
Our rev/Non-GAAP EPS est. of $319mn/($0.49) is slightly above on revenue, but in-line
on EPS compared to the Street est. at $318mn/($0.39). We model total listener hours
at 5.58bn and total RPM rates of $52. Our FY16 est. are slightly above on revenue, but
well above on EPS as we expect losses this year to improve in 2H16 as Pandora builds
up subs, but still see Pandora failing to gain much leverage from increased R&D
spending and S&M spend. We maintain our $9 PO, based on 1x our 2018 revenue
estimate, a discount to peers, but justified in our view as Pandora is likely to have a
difficult transition year as it builds it on-Demand service.

Priceline (Buy, $1,920 PO)
Stock view: Expect solid 1Q top-line, but 2Q can be rough for guidance
Priceline’s metric trends and commentary, along with 1Q booking and room night
guidance, indicate that the company continues to capture strong market share growth in
the category, with little impact from hotel direct booking initiatives or competitive OTA
marketing spend. We expect a strong 1Q, with perhaps a little less upside than usual
due to the late 4Q reporting date.
Looking forward to 2Q, we have our usual caution on guidance as 2Q is the most backend
loaded quarter for bookings and revenues. However, in 2017 the Easter shift is a
positive factor and will help 2Q revenues and earnings. We also expect 1Q bookings and
room night growth upside to translate into higher 2Q gross profit growth, and
management indicated that there is less marketing ROI pressure expected in 1H'17 than
in 2H'16. Overall, we expect Priceline’s strong business trends to continue, and would
use extra conservatism in guidance as a buying opportunity.
Given strong execution and higher exposure to more fragmented International markets,
Priceline remains our top long-term idea in Online travel. However, on a near-term
basis, we think Expedia could see a bigger stock benefit from an acceleration in room
night growth over the summer.
Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Room night growth
We expect Priceline to report 26% y/y room night growth (deceleration v. 31% in 4Q),
ahead of the company’s outlook of 20-25% hotel room night growth. Priceline has a
history of guiding 1Q conservatively, looking at Priceline’s historical 1Q results for
Bookings, revenue and EPS vs guidance suggests modest upside to our bookings growth
forecast of 22% and reported 1Q’17 EPS closer to $9.55 (13% upside vs. the midpoint)
vs. our estimate of $9.08 and the Street’s estimate $8.75.

Biggest 1Q issues/risks:
• Concerns on threat of increasing marketing competition with Expedia and
TripAdvisor
• Potential pressure on US inbound traffic given the Trump travel ban (unlikely to
impact Priceline given high Intl exposure)
• Marketing deleverage – our model assumes 340bps of y/y online marketing
deleverage in 1Q
• Pressure on hotel revenue take rates given less hotel participation in commission
programs and longer booking windows
Early 1Q RevPAR data mixed
Priceline’s Booking.com has roughly 1.2mn properties on its site (>611k hotels and 576k
vacation rental properties). According to STR, 1Q US RevPAR through initial March
readings decelerated 30bps to 3.0% y/y, and European RevPAR through February
accelerated 600bps q/q to 3.6% y/y (FX-neutral). The STR data reflects a continued
32 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017
gradual deceleration in US RevPAR growth and a positive recovery in European RevPAR
growth as the region laps terrorist attacks and geopolitical uncertainty.

Estimates vs. Consensus: We are above the Street on EBITDA/EPS in 1Q
Our 1Q revenue/EPS of $2.4bn/$9.08 is broadly in line to slightly above the Street at
$2.4bn/$8.75. We see upside to the company’s 1Q EPS guide of $8.25-$8.65. We

Our price objective is $1,920 based on 22x our 2018 adj. EPS estimate. The 22x
multiple is towards the upper end of Priceline's historical multiple range of 13-23x and
represents a PEG of 1.4x. We think a 22x forward P/E multiple is appropriate given midteens
EPS growth, strong booking trends, Priceline's leadership position in the global
online travel sector, track record of EPS upside, and increased access to the China via
the Ctrip investment.

Snap (Neutral, $25 PO)
Stock view: Long-term potential, but near-term could be lumpy
Snap will report its first earnings as a public company and expectations have a wide
range. The 2H16 DAU slowdown has raised concerns in terms of both competitive risk
and execution, so user trends could be the most important metric in the quarter. At this
point, it’s difficult to gauge relative impact of Facebook / Instagram competition,
Android technical issues, product cycle lumpiness, and seasonality to the recent
slowdown. Nonetheless, our sense is that DAU expectations are around 164-166mn, and
we’d expect variability (higher or lower) to have a meaningful impact on stock
sentiment.
In terms of the P&L, we expect a slight q/q decline in revenue per normal seasonality
and are modeling down 1% q/q (consistent with comments in the prospectus filing).
While we can appreciate the momentum of the API roll-out with several new
partnerships announced in January, our checks suggest most programs are early stage
with limited volume to date. Considering the rest of the P&L, we expect a fairly messy
quarter between deal costs, the CEO stock award, and a catch-up RSU stock comp
expense. As we do not anticipate non-GAAP profitability until 2H19, we expect
traditional P&L metrics will be less of a focus in the coming quarters.
We recently initiated coverage with a Neutral and $25 price target (please see User
overhang unlikely to be resolved in a Snap – Initiate at Neutral with $25 PO). Social
media sector history suggests a wide range of possible outcomes for Snap and, as such,
near-term lumpiness in metrics could result in high volatility for the stock. We also note
that lock-up overhang could drag on near-term performance into the first lock-up
expiration on 7/29.
Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: DAUs, ARPU, and competition
We believe the key metric for the quarter will be the DAU number, which we model at
166mn (up 8mn q/q, 36% y/y). We believe DAU headwinds may peak 1H17 as the
company is facing an onslaught of competitive products (see More Stories in the Snap
competitive saga), technical challenges with Android (from Memories), and seasonality
entering the summer. We model ARPU at $1.01 (down 5% q/q), with North America
ARPU at $2.03 (down 7% q/q). We won’t be surprised to see upside in ARPU driven by
ad load growth and higher user engagement, though competitive pricing could
potentially offset.
Biggest 1Q issues/risks:
• DAU deceleration on share loss: Anything short of 164mn will likely be met with
skepticism as investors extrapolate recent trends in considering competitive
resilience vs Instagram, Facebook, and others. Management will likely address the
Android technical issues impact on DAUs.
• Aggressive pricing could drive short term growth but have mixed perception:
Twitter noted elevated competition and potentially aggressive pricing surfacing in
mid-January, which aligns well with Snap’s API update.
• Lack of visibility into pipeline: While we don’t necessarily expect new product
announcements, lack of color/visibility on the product pipeline could disappoint.
• Results could leave investors looking for more disclosure: We are not sure what
disclosure Snap will provide on results, and important trending info (like average
minutes per user) could be lacking.
Top 1Q data points: comScore suggests some gains for Instagram
While comScore data is not consistent with reported minutes, it is useful for relative
comparisons. The data puts Snapchat minutes per user well above Twitter, but still
34 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017
trailing Instagram and Facebook. Interestingly, after Snapchat passed Instagram in early
2016 in average minutes per user, Instagram recaptured the lead mid-year and has
extended it since. While the cause for the shift is not certain, the trends align with the
launch of Instagram Stories (August 2016) as well as some technology challenges on the
Snapchat front (Android). Regardless of the near-term lumpiness, we believe overall
daily engagement puts Snapchat in a strong position to capture emerging online
marketing ad budgets.

Estimates vs Consensus
Our 1Q revenue estimate of $163mn (down 1% q/q) is slightly above consensus at
$158mn (down 5%), but we note the range of estimates is considerable ($130-196mn)
and some checks suggest that Snap was aggressive with advertisers in 1Q. For the
year, our $1.0bn revenue estimate is mostly in-line with the Street, as is our 2018
estimate at $2.1bn. We do not model positive adjusted EBITDA until 2Q19, and expect
investors to focus mostly on user revenue trends.

Our $25 PO is based on our DCF model as we do not expect the company to be
profitable until mid- to late-2019 and any earnings-based valuation exercise would
require discounting back future earnings. Our DCF assumes approximately $28bn
revenue by 2027 based on 525mn DAUs and $50+ in ARPU. Our PO implies 15.5x EV /
Revenue, above the peer group at 4x, as we believe Snap's early stage of ad
monetization and potential future leverage in the business model warrants a premium
valuation multiple to the social media group.
36 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017
TripAdvisor (Underperform, $40 PO)
Stock view: EBITDA under pressure, brand ad spend not in Street estimates yet
2016 was a re-platforming year, and with Instant Book fully rolled out globally, the
company aims to re-educate visitors on its booking offering. However, we think most
TripAdvisor visitors (399mn average monthly unique visitors in 2017 and 148mn
average monthly hotel shoppers) still view the site as a review/research portal, and
changing customer behavior will be quite difficult, particularly as we do not think
TripAdvisor has clarified its value proposition for shoppers.
While we think that TripAdvisor’s elevated marketing spend in 2017 will drive a rebound
in traffic, we anticipate a poor ROI. Marketing expense continues to ramp as Instant
Book rolls out, though traffic growth slows, implying more costly traffic acquisition. In
4Q’16, Sales & Marketing as a % of sales increased to 52.8% vs. 45.6% in 4Q’15, and
we think TripAdvisor essentially bought desktop Hotel Shopper traffic, though likely at
poor ROI. However, higher marketing spend in 2017 does not yet include potential for a
likely return to expensive brand ad campaigns. In our brand ad spend scenario analysis,
we expect still more downside to estimates (see Taking a look at TripAdvisor’s potential
brand ad spend).
The company is encouraged by Revenue per Hotel Shopper growth continuing to
improve from down 21% y/y in 1Q. We expect growth continues its improvement trend
in 2017. However, if monetization trends decelerate, earnings downside could be
significant. We think it will be difficult for TripAdvisor’s Hotel revenue to return to
growth next year, let alone double-digit y/y growth, given the mobile monetization
headwinds. However, if the company invests heavily in traffic acquisition, particularly on
higher monetizing desktop, revenue and traffic growth may reaccelerate meaningfully in
2017, though with ongoing pressure on margins.

Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Update on ad spend targets, 2017 guidance
TRIP’s outlook for 2017 is based on “prioritizing revenue growth as opposed to profit
growth,” which implies far lower marketing return expectations. However, TRIP notes
this expectation for marketing spend does not include potential for a return to brand
marketing, which could be an incremental $50-70mn headwind in ’17, in our view.
Biggest 1Q issues/risks:
• Marketing spend: TripAdvisor has prioritized revenue growth at the expense of
earnings, implying poor marketing ROI. The biggest issue facing TripAdvisor is if it
decides to pursue an expensive brand/TV marketing campaign which would further
drive further earnings downside.
Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 37
• Instant Book impact: The Instant Book transition could impact meta rates and total
monetization as more hotel shoppers flow through large OTA partners.
• Hotel Shopper growth: Given elevated marketing spend, we expect to see a rebound
in hotel shopper and hotel revenue growth. 4Q16 hotel shopper growth accelerated
from 3% in 2Q-3Q16 to 8%. We expect hotel shopper growth to decelerate slightly
to 6% in 1Q17 on a 200bps tougher y/y comp.
1Q traffic data points: comScore indicates solid mobile and PC user growth
In the US, comScore reported quarter to date through February, average monthly unique
visitors of 31mn on PC and 56mn on mobile, up 24% and up 3% y/y, respectively.
TripAdvisor total minutes in 1Q through February is up 10%, with mobile minutes up 5%
and PC minutes up 17%. In our view, TripAdvisor’s elevated marketing spend YTD likely
targets higher monetizing PC traffic.
Estimates vs. Consensus: Broadly in-line on Revenue, below on EBITDA/EPS
Our 1Q revenue estimate of $379mn is broadly in line with the Street at $377mn. We
are more cautious on EBITDA and EPS at $71mn/$0.23 vs. the Street at $76mn/$0.27.

Trivago (Buy, $15 PO)
Stock view: Advertising continues to drive growth engine
Trivago’s 4Q revenue and EBITDA results highlight the company’s rapid revenue growth
and potential for solid profitability. Though there are concerns over the company’s large
marketing spend (80-85% of revenue), we think the Street will view Trivago’s results
positively given continued revenue ramp while also achieving profitability. The stock
remains highly volatile given the limited float. Commentary during 4Q’16 earnings from
Trivago’s key customers Expedia and Priceline (as well as from TripAdvisor) indicated
that paid traffic has been growing faster than free traffic, and that companies in the
sector planned to ramp ad spend to drive continued traffic growth, which is a positive
for Trivago.
Trivago has best-in-class revenue growth, with 2017 revenue growth expected at 47%
(vs. guidance of 45%+), led by 50% qualified referral growth. We also expect Trivago will
become more efficient with advertising and start to reap the benefits of past brand
advertising, with return on advertising spend (ROAS) improving across regions in 2017,
a key driver of modestly improving EBITDA margin from 3.7% in 2016 to 3.9% in 2017.
The company remains in growth mode, led by click revenue growth in ROW and
Americas regions, as Trivago is driving brand awareness outside its key European
foothold through aggressive brand marketing. The company is adding qualified referrals
at an accelerating rate as it expands beyond its core Developed Europe markets and
penetrates new markets. We think the company has significant runway for growth and
can sustain 30%+ revenue growth through the end of the decade. As the business
matures in its new Americas and ROW markets, we expect a better balance between
profit and growth. We think EBITDA margins should accelerate as the company
leverages ‘16 and ‘17 marketing spend, with greater uplift in ‘18.
Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Qualified referral growth
We forecast 56% qualified referral growth in 1Q (920bps deceleration on 730bps
tougher y/y comp), led by 38% y/y growth in Developed Europe, 48% in Americas, and
110% in ROW. We expect continued robust marketing spend will drive user growth.
Biggest 1Q issues/risks:
• Weak return on advertising spend (ROAS) may be an earnings headwind.
Competition in the company’s advertising channels may result in lower ROI trends.
The company may also see less efficient advertising in newer, less mature markets.
• A positive update to 2017 guidance may be expected. Trivago currently expects
total revenue growth of 45%+ and adjusted EBITDA margin is guided to flat to
slightly up vs. 2016’s 3.7%.
Estimates vs. Consensus: Expect revenue in-line vs. the Street, EBITDA ahead
For 1Q, we expect revenue/EBITDA of €241mn/(€12mn) vs. the Street at
€241mn/(€10mn). We expect 2017 and 2018 revenue and EBITDA to come above the
Street and expect there is room for upside to management’s 2017 revenue growth and
EBITDA margin guidance.

in line with the lead generation peer group average 2018E EV/Sales multiple. We think
our EV/Sales multiple is warranted as a balance between Trivago's higher growth and
lower profitability. Our price objective is supported by our DCF analysis.
40 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017
Wayfair (Neutral, $44 PO)
Stock view: Timeline on profitability still an issue, but comps ease in 2Q’17
Wayfair’s two issues have been deceleration in U.S. revenue growth and negative
operating margins as the company continues to aggressively invest in logistics,
international expansion, marketing, and new categories. 1Q customer and order growth
comps remain tough, which was one of the drivers of revenue growth guidance below
expectations. Wayfair also attributed weak guidance to caution on the retail
environment and added investment. Growth comps ease in 2Q/3Q, and there is potential
for more stable growth in 2Q guidance to drive improving investor sentiment.
As for margins, management guided to EBITDA margin of (3.5%)-(3.8%), a deceleration
from (2.8%) in 1Q’16 due to a lower opex absorption in the quarter on seasonally lower
sales. The US is expected to swing back to EBITDA losses in 1Q’17, while Intl losses are
expected to remain steady. We forecast EBITDA margin of (2.4%), with (0.2%) EBITDA
margin in the US and (19.0%) margin in International. The company continues to expect
little to no ad spend leverage given increase International ad spend.
Management historically builds conservativism into its guidance and, until last year, had
a track record of beating the upper end of its sales outlook by ~10%. Recently, revenue
has been by a low-single digit percentage. Our above consensus 1Q revenue forecast
implies 1% upside to the high end of the guidance range, in line with the trend over the
past 3 quarters. We think investors expect sales growth above the guidance range as
well.

Over the past two quarters, Wayfair has expressed caution on the macro environment,
though this proved to be somewhat unwarranted in 4Q. According to February 2017
aggregated BAC credit and debit card data, furniture sales were up 1.3% (down 0.4% on
rolling 3-month m/m basis), while home goods were down 1.2% y/y and flat on a rolling
3 month m/m basis. Please see the BofA Merrill Lynch US Economics team's report for
additional commentary on broader retail trends and a detailed explanation of the
methodology and limitations in connection with BAC data. Williams-Sonoma reported
disappointing 4Q earnings (March 15 th report) and provided modest 1Q guidance that
the BofA Merrill Lynch Hardline Retail team called “a little rich,” though it is difficult to
tell if weak trends are the result of secular home goods weakness or the disruptive
impact of eCommerce players like Wayfair.
Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: 2Q revenue guidance on easier y/y comps
1Q revenue guidance was a disappointment, though comps ease in 2Q’17, and
opportunity for more stable US growth could aid stock sentiment. Customer growth in
2Q has a 400bps easier y/y comp vs 1Q17, while order growth has a 1700bps easier y/y
comp. Overall, revenue growth faces a 1600bps easier y/y comp. and would expect
guidance anywhere near the Street’s 2Q estimate at 25% y/y growth to be viewed
positively given several quarters of guidance below street estimates.
Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 41
Biggest 1Q issues/risks:
• Commentary on US customer trends, particularly repeat rates and unit economics
(customer acquisition costs).
• AOV trends given street concerns that some customer metrics are benefitting from
purchase of lower value items.
• Progress with International investments, especially early results from ad spending in
UK, Canada, and Germany.
1Q data points indicate mixed traffic trends
US data indicates that Wayfair PC minutes growth increased 17% y/y in 1Q through
February vs. 14% y/y growth in 4Q’16. Wayfair mobile minutes have decreased 24% y/y
through February in 1Q vs. up 3% y/y in 4Q’16. US PC user growth decreased 16% y/y in
1Q through February, vs. 4Q at -25% y/y. Wayfair mobile user growth increased 2% y/y
in 1Q through February vs. 16% y/y in 4Q.
Estimates vs. Consensus: Expect revenue and EPS upside vs. the Street
For 1Q, we expect revenue/EBITDA of $944mn/($22mn) vs. the Street at
$933mn/($32mn). Total revenue guidance of $905-930mn implies 2-year stacked
growth of 97-101% vs. 121% in 2016, which seems conservative. We expect the
company’s revenue to come in above the high end of the sales outlook as Direct
Revenue sales were up 30% quarter to date (through nearly 2 months of 1Q’17). Our
1Q revenue growth forecast is based on 48% y/y customer growth (up 9% q/q) and 42%
order growth (down 10% q/q). Wayfair expects EBITDA margin of (3.5%)-(3.8%) due to a
lower opex absorption in the quarter on seasonally lower sales. The company continues
to expect little to no ad spend leverage given increase International ad spend.

Our PO of $44 is based on 0.7x 2018E EV/sales. We continue to focus on EV/Sales given
Wayfair’s lack of profitability due to US fulfilment investment and Intl. expansion. Our
0.7x target multiple is a discount to Wayfair’s eCommerce comp group at 1.3x and at a
modest discount to a retail peer comp group at 0.8x. We think the multiple is
appropriate given strong revenue growth vs. peers, balanced by lower profitability.
42 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017
Twitter (Underperform, $14.50)
Stock view: Engagement could be improving, but still trailing peers
On positive note, DAU growth, tweet impressions, and time spent growth have all been
accelerating, and we won’t be surprised if most metrics show stable growth in 1Q17
given event activity (political, sports, awards shows) in 1Q. However, the NFL season is
over, the election surprise is slowing fading, competitive pressure is rising (particularly
Instagram), and new monetization initiatives will take time, so we are more cautious on
2Q. The high level of executive churn also raises an element of strategic uncertainty
that could continue to weigh on sentiment. While it’s possible Twitter could see
moderate residual benefit from recent YouTube/Google Display Network boycotts, we
continue to believe MAU growth acceleration is key to improving sentiment, and we
continue to expect other platforms to grow much faster. The biggest upside driver for
1Q could be conservative guidance, which implied revenues would be down 17% y/y at
the midpoint in 1Q.
Longer-term, our primary concerns are user growth, rising competition in video, and lack
of positive advertiser feedback. Despite execution on the live streaming initiative in
2016, MAU impact was underwhelming and we see risk of rising costs and/or content
loss in 2017. At this point, it’s unclear how aggressively management will push live
streaming in 2017, and early exploration of potential subscription revenue streams
(enhanced Tweetdeck offering beta) could suggest potential strategic shifts. On the
advertiser side, we are still hearing limited traction with Twitter’s ad platform changes
and ROI measurement, and it seems experimental dollars are being moved to Snap.
The biggest risk to our Underperform rating, in our view, is the underlying value of the
Twitter platform for users and potential Artificial Intelligence (AI) signals. We remain on
the sideline for now, with ever-present M&A potential providing some element of a floor
to the stock. We think 3x 2017 revenues plus cash ($12/share in total) is a valuation an
acquirer could see as very reasonable given stabilizing DAU trends and value of Twitter
data.
Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Mgmt focus on engagement, investors on users
MAU growth likely remains the primary focus in terms of metrics investors consider.
While DAU growth could continue to growth at high single digits, we do not see much
upside potential to low single digit MAU growth (we model 322mn, 4% y/y), which lags
in comparison to Facebook’s recent17% y/y growth. We expect engagement metrics in
general (tweet impressions, DAU growth, time spent) to be solid, though it’s possible
lack of NFL and fading US election catalysts could have some negative effect. In terms
of monetization, our ARPU estimate for $1.67 implies a 14% y/y decline, which reflects
both weaker Twitter pricing trends and potential competitive pricing pressures.
Biggest 1Q issues/risks:
• MAU growth could slip: We model 4% y/y MAU growth to 322mn, but fading NFL
and election tailwinds could lead to weaker user growth trends in 2Q.
• Competition could impact pricing: Management noted elevated competition in
mid-January (shortly after Snap’s ad API update), which may have continued
throughout the quarter and impacted pricing more than anticipated.
• Live streaming pipeline in question: Amazon recently announced a deal with the
NFL to steam game content, replacing Twitter.
• Ad product wind-down could impact revenue: Management indicated that it is
reevaluating lower return ad formats, and a decision to wind down certain formats
(like direct response, promoted tweets) could further impact 2Q guidance.

Top 1Q data points
comScore mobile data indicated US monthly active users were up 2% y/y and down 4%
q/q (down 3mn q/q), versus our estimate for +4% y/y, +1% q/q. Total minutes for 1Q17
(2-mo. data) are tracking down 18% y/y, with mobile down 18% and desktop down 23%.
Mobile minutes have averaged a 20% y/y decline for the last 4 months.
Estimates vs Consensus
Our 1Q17 rev/EPS estimates for $535mn/$0.03 are slightly above the Street and above
the implied midpoint of management’s guidance (based on EBITDA and EBITDA margin
outlook). Despite our near-term concerns, we believe the outlook was sufficiently
conservative. That said, we see risk to current consensus estimates for the year, and we
are below Street revenue at $2.3bn for 2017 vs consensus at $2.35bn, though slightly
ahead on EBITDA on more moderate cost assumptions. Our 2017 estimates assume a
conservative 4% MAU growth for the year.

Our $14.50 price objective is based on 12x our 2018 EBITDA estimate, which reflects a
discount to the online media group (13x). We believe the Twitter platform has slowing
user and revenue growth and as such, we expect the stock to trade at a sustained
discount to online media peers, with potential M&A adding some offsetting downside
support.

Yelp (Neutral, $43 PO)
Stock view: Likely to be some improvement vs last quarter
Yelp is coming off of a quarter with decelerating app unique devices, weak new
customer adds, and decelerating sales force growth, and it seems likely that one or two
of these metrics will improve. The tone at our recent investor meetings with the CFO
seem to suggest that 4Q issues did not signal a break in the model (see On the road
with Yelp), and we expect an improvement q/q customer adds. We think the company
should be able achieve Street 1Q revenue and EBITDA estimates, though we won’t be
surprised to see the 2Q17 outlook come in slightly below current Street estimates.
For the full year outlook, while we believe the implied expense growth in the 2017
outlook is somewhat conservative, management appears focused on investing in the
business for now and we think upside is more likely to come in 2Q or 3Q. Overall, we
remain somewhat cautious on the stock given potential revenue deceleration due to
tough comps and a deceleration in sales force growth.
On the cost front, management has been clear in its intention to invest in performance
marketing, which could take time to bear fruit. In addition, we believe sales force growth
to stabilize/increase going forward, which would seem to suggest potential cost
headwinds relative to recent quarters. Finally, while we don’t have the specific
financials, the addition of Nowait ($40mn acquisition closed 2/28) likely encompasses a
moderate bump up in opex with limited revenue to offset.
As we look ahead, we are encouraged with the three transitions within company and we
will be looking for progress on the following on the call. The first is connections
between consumers and businesses on Yelp through clicks, reservation services,
ordering, and Request a Quote. The second is a ramp up in performance marketing as
users engage in more measurable events. The third is new customer acquisition via
alternative channels, including national customers from outside sales alongside selfserve
customers via online channels.
Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: new account adds, app unique devices growth
Given the miss last quarter and pressure on sales force headcount, local advertising
accounts will be important gauge of overall execution. Other key metrics include app
unique devices growth, which has been decelerating since mid-2015 from 51% y/y to
20% in 4Q16. Performance marketing could reverse the trend, but it could take some
time. Finally, while management continues to highlight a decoupling of sales force
growth and topline trends, investors still pay attention to overall sales force growth,
particularly given the three consecutive quarters of deceleration from 44% y/y (1Q16) to
11% y/y (4Q17). Management has indicated that sales force growth in 2017 should be
in the double digits.

• Local revenue deceleration: We assume 750bps of y/y growth deceleration in
1Q17 vs 4Q16.
Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 45
• Metrics could remain under pressure: Investors likely will look for stabilization in
key metrics such as app unique devices growth and local ad account growth, but it
could take time for incremental marketing and sales investments to bear fruit.
• Stock comp could create overhang: With Alphabet’s decision to only report GAAP
profits, Yelp’s high stock comp (67% of 2017E EBITDA) could create overhang to
the valuation.
Leading indicator data points:
Salesforce growth decelerating
While it possible that Yelp sees improving productivity per salesperson, and the mix shift
to national and self-serve reduces reliance on direct sales, the deceleration in salesforce
headcount is a negative leading indicator for revenues.

Accrued sales bonus and commissions tracking lower
We note that 4Q accrued bonuses and commissions are down y/y and reflect only 0.3%
of NTM revenue, which would be the lowest ratio seen in recent years. Even on an
absolute basis, the total accrued bonuses and commissions of $3.1mn is the lowest
since mid-2013. While this is likely due in part to gains in self-serve and perhaps
increased sales focus on National accounts, the change is noteworthy, in our view.

In addition, the y/y change in commissions expense disclosed in company filings
continued a downward trend to negative territory. Over the course of 2016, the number
has gone from +$5.7mn in 1Q16, to +$2.4mn in 2Q16, to +$1.4mn in 3Q16, to down
$1.7mn in 4Q16.
We also consider comScore mobile data, which indicated that US monthly active users
were up 2% y/y (2-months data) while desktop monthly active users were down 14%
y/y. This reflects a moderate deceleration in mobile from 4Q (+4%) and slightly lower
declines in desktop (4Q at -16%). Total QTD US minutes are down 6% y/y for mobile (vs
+4% in 4Q), though App minutes were flat, and desktop was up 6% y/y (vs +1% in 4Q).
The somewhat weaker mobile minutes trend is notable, particularly the lack of growth in
Estimates vs Consensus
Our revenue and EBITDA estimates are slightly above consensus for both 1Q17 and
2Q17, as well as for 2017 and 2018. We expect local ad revenue to grow 28% y/y in 1Q
(vs 36% in 4Q) and transaction revenue to grow 17.5% (vs 19% in 4Q). Our 2017
estimates are near the high end of management’s 2017 outlook, and we would expect
any upside potential to likely surface in the latter half of the year.

We are more constructive on the stock given more negative sentiment and recent selloff,
but maintain our Neutral rating given the decelerating sales leading indicator
metrics and tougher revenue comps. Our $43 price objective is based on 14x 2018E
EV/EBITDA, slightly above online media comps, which we believe is warranted given the
higher margin potential in the model. We believe our multiple balances premium growth
vs peers with medium-term concerns on competition and limited GAAP profitability. We
believe the slight premium valuation is sustainable if the company can continue to
deliver 20%+ y/y topline growth, which would be above the advertising industry.
Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 47
Zillow (Buy, $42 PO)
Stock view: controversy sounding the mortgage business
While we still expect Zillow’s core business to have a solid quarter on product
improvements, the self-serve platform, and its recent Seller Boost product, the
controversy surrounding Zillow’s mortgage business (which potentially has implications
for Zillow’s core business and the retail estate industry) has been a key recent driver of
the stock. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has indicated that it views
Zillow’s mortgage referral system as potentially violating parts of the Real Estate
Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA). RESPA (Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act) is
an act designed to product potential homeowners by outlawing kickback and referral
fees from real estate services, particularly in relation to mortgage brokers who often
receive referrals from real estate agents. Since Zillow’s mortgage referrals involve a
pre-application and a referral directly to a mortgage agent that than a larger entity like a
bank, this could be violating the act. Mortgage brokers often fund some of the real
estate agents online advertising expenses and a crackdown on mortgage agents could
potentially hurt real estate agents ability to spend dollars on Zillow.
For now it is too early to say how this will develop as there are conflicting views for and
against this view with the CFPB not releasing an official stance, but we expect this to be
a near term overhang on the stock until a clear view of the CFPB’s view and intentions
unfold. While a contentious issue, mortgage revenue is still only 8% of total revenue
and even a cut back would have a minimal impact to overall revenue growth. As for the
impact on real estate agent spend on Zillow, we believe at with only roughly 5%
penetration into real estate agents online spend Zillow has plenty of room to grow the
core business and the high ROI of the ad unit will ensure agents buy placements on
Zillow regardless of mortgage broker involvement and continue to like the stock.
Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Mortgage requests and revenue per loan
With the controversy surrounding the mortgage business, we think investors will be
extra focused on the mortgage unit and focus on the mortgage revenue per loan request
and consumer load requests. Zillow will be releasing new metrics this quarter to replace
ARPA and premier agent count, but has yet to indicate what those metrics will be. Key
topics for the call will likely include: 1) mortgage business outlook; 2) premier agent
advertising spend; 3) rentals business; and 4) progress on FY17 goals.
Biggest 1Q issues/risks:
• If the CFPB decides Zillow violates RESPA, Zillow could face fines and have to
retool its mortgage platform.
• New metrics for FY17 could give less visibility into the business as a whole.
• Slower than expected penetration of self-service platform leading to increased
S&M costs.
• Potential for a weak 2Q guide if mortgage issues overhang the business as a whole.
Top 1Q traffic data points: comScore suggests usage up in 1Q
comScore desktop data suggests that unique visitors were down 5% quarter to date
(Jan. and Feb.) while usage was up 2% QTD. However, on mobile, comScore data
suggests usage is up 14% y/y on a bigger unique visitor base to 62mn unique users and
usage was up 7%. We note comScore has made several methodology changes which
has impacted the consistency of recent months data.
Estimates vs. Consensus: We are above the Street
Over rev/EBITDA estimates of $239mn/$40mn is above the Street at $236mn/$39mn.
We estimate that ARPA will be up 29% y/y to $629 and premier agent subscribers will
be flat y/y at 91.9K. Overall, we estimate 28% y/y growth, but note that the mortgage
issues could potentially impact revenue. For rentals and other we estimate $32mn in
revenue, up 75% y/y.

Zillow has effectively captured the online U.S. real estate market, allowing them to
accelerate monetization and access to a large TAM with $87bn in total real estate
commissions paid in 2016 and Zillow powering just 5% of the commissions through its
Premier Agent platform. Although there is potential for the mortgage business to
create a headwind if the CFPB issued a negative ruling against Zillow, we still like the
stock into the quarter, as we prefer business with minimal competition, and believe that
the high ROI of the real estate premium platform to real estate agents will ensure
agents buy placements on Zillow regardless of mortgage broker involvement. We
maintain our $42 PO based on a 6x our 2018E EV/Sales and supported by our DCF
valuation. Our multiple is roughly in-line for online real estate lead generation sites in
other countries operating in developed countries.
Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 49
Zynga (Underperform, $2.70)
Stock view: Live events can improve franchises, but still need new titles
Zynga launched Dawn of Titans end of 4Q, and although it progressed into the top 20
grossing games in the U.S. Apple store, it has fallen out of the top 100 at some points
during the quarter suggesting that its overall revenue contribution has been fairly low.
While this is somewhat disappointing, we think investor expectations for the game are
now at reasonable (lower) levels.
Instead of big new title launches, Zynga has indicated it is focused on strengthening its
current franchises with better engagement and monetization through live events and
new features, and progress in this area is key for the 2017 stock outlook. Zynga Poker
(up roughly 80% y/y YTD) appears to be benefiting from the focus on engagement and
live events with much stronger monetization, which could offset declines in other titles.
Overall, we think it could be hard to get the Street excited on the stock without a strong
future title that could drive more than single digit growth.
Key theme/metric(s): DAUs, and live events impact on DAU trends
After launching 10 new games in 2016, Zynga is focusing more heavily on live events to
drive engagement with in franchises rather than launching additional titles. This should,
if successful, translate into better DAU metrics as consumer engage with a title more
often. With Dawn of Titan likely coming below Street expectations, stronger
engagement will be necessarily for Zynga to drive a stronger DAU base. For the quarter,
we model 17.9mn online game DAUs for 1Q, down slightly q/q, and down 6% y/y.
Biggest issues/risks:
• Dawn of Titans revenues: Zynga spend several years developing the game and lack
of title success could impact sentiment.
• Expense leverage and cost-cutting benefits do not materialize: Zynga plans to
further improve operational efficiency and potentially cut non-profitable franchises,
but this may be hard to do without impacting long term growth opportunities.
• Lack of new releases: Zynga gave no indication of when it will release its next
title leaving current franchises to carry revenue and earnings.
Top data points: Zynga game bookings tracking in-line to slightly below est.
Zynga’s largest revenue generating franchises, Zynga Poker was up significantly in 1Q.
Zynga Poker appears to be benefiting from live events and is tracking up roughly 89%
QTD. Combined slots titles appear a bit more challenged with total revenue down 30%
QTD y/y, in part due to lower monetization on Wizard of Oz slots which is tracking down
in gross gaming rankings. Overall, QTD (January and February) Zynga online game
bookings (ex-ad revenue) is tracking up 7% y/y vs our 1Q est. of bookings up 9% y/y.

Estimates vs. Consensus: Mostly inline to the Street
We are slightly above the street on revenue at $189mn vs. $188mn, but in-line on
EBITDA at $20mn. Cost cutting could improve EBITDA and Zynga has restructured some
of its workforce and is focusing on driving more engagement with live events in its
game franchises. For 2017, we are below the Street on revenue at $779mn vs. $805mn,
but above on EBITDA at $101mn vs $99mn.

Zynga is improving profitability while engaging players better with live services but we
remain cautious on the company’s ability to materially grow its audience and still favor
the console gaming group. Zynga should have downside support given roughly $1.50 in
cash and assets and strategic franchise value (we estimate Poker/Slots generates over
$250mn+ in revenue annually). Our $2.70 PO is based on 11x 2018E EBITDA (which is a
premium to the Mobile gaming peer group due to margin expansion potential), plus
$1.41/share in cash and assets (building).

Price objective basis & risk
Alphabet (GOOGL / GOOG)
Our price objective is $1025/$1025, representing 17x our core 2018 Google non-GAAP
EPS estimate (excluding non-Google losses), plus $118/share in cash, or 21x core
Google GAAP EPS plus cash. Alphabet has traded at 12-24x forward P/E over the last
five years and we think our 17x multiple is reasonable given shareholder friendly actions
that include the non-core revenue and operating loss disclosures, and stock buybacks.
Downside risks to our PO are: 1) Search revenue growth decelerates faster than
anticipated due to market maturity, 2) mobile transition drives negative search behavior
changes, 3) revenue growth pressure from competitor initiatives, 4) margins disappoint
due to revenue mix and investment initiatives, and 5) negative regulatory changes,
including EU antitrust. The stock has been subject to heavy volatility in the past based
on revenue growth and margin trends and this volatility could increase if economic
conditions deteriorate.
Amazon.com (AMZN)
Our PO of $1,100 is based on our SOP that values AWS at $127bn or $259 per share
and the retail business at $413bn or $841 per share. Our 5.5x AWS multiple is a modest
premium to the software/SaaS comp group at 5.0x on 2018 sales, and 0.9x multiple is a
premium to a retail general merchandise comp group at 0.7x. We think the premiums are
warranted given share gains and superior growth. Our $1,100 price objective implies
2.8x 2018E Price/Sales, a multiple above the high end of Amazon's historical range of
1.0-2.5x. We argue the historical P/S multiple should increase given positive 3rd party
sales (3P) that is reported on a net basis, a higher AWS revenue contribution, and record
gross profit margins.
Downside risks to our price objective are a consumer spending slowdown, rich P/E
multiple, margin or growth pressure from the digitization of media, more aggressive
offline competition, hardware strategy, AWS investments and/or price cuts, Prime
Instant Video content costs, and decelerating growth. The stock has been subject to
heavy volatility in the past, based on margin trends, and this volatility could increase due
to economic uncertainty.
Bankrate (RATE)
Our $13 price objective is based on 9x our 2018E EV/EBITDA, a slight discount to the
online lead-gen and marketplace peer group average of 11x. We believe it is reasonable
for RATE to trade at a slight discount given RATE's recent challenges to both growth
and margins and its position as a turnaround in the space.
Downside risks to our PO are: 1) limited visibility into intra-quarter trends, 2) stock
dependent on economic outlook, 3) card issuer spending is volatile and the turnaround is
short lived, 4) slower growth in personal loans than expected, 5) higher than expected
marketing spending to drive traffic to Bankrate sites, resulting in lower margins, 6)
Google changes have a negative impact on marketing margins and EPS, 7) competition
with other consumer finance sites, and 8) a large acquisition.
Care.com (CRCM)
Our $9 price objective is based on 1.3x 2018E EV/Sales or 10x 2018E EV/EBITDA, in line
with small cap ecommerce and subscription peers. Care.com has category leadership
and a large TAM, but we do not believe 7% 2-yr expected revenue growth warrants a
premium to peers. At the same time, we believe that the Google Capital investment
could provide some downside support on take-out potential.
Downside risks to our PO are 1) need to add more customers each year to grow given
high churn, 2) competition from SitterCity and Homestead, and 3) new care offerings
Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 53
(mobile apps, premium nanny, date night payment services etc.) may not see much
traction, 4) lower conversion rates on mobile, 5) mobile conversions with 30% fee to
Apple and Google Play marketplaces could negatively impact margins, and 6)
international expansion may not be successful given different demographics.
Upside risks to our PO are 1) lower marketing spend resulting in higher margins and
better leverage in 2016, 2) revenue upside from cross-selling and word of mouth, 3)
increase length of stay for paid subscribers, reducing churn, and 4) traction from new
care offerings, Care at Work, and international expansion.
eBay (EBAY)
Our $38 price objective is based on 17x our 2018E EPS. Our 17x P/E multiple is slightly
ahead of the retail comp group average of about 16x, reflecting eBay's potential for a
Marketplace growth acceleration in 2017.
Risks to our price objective are: 1) competition from Amazon and other new
Marketplaces in the U.S., competition from Amazon, Alibaba and local incumbents in
International markets, and competition from multi-channel retailers that are
aggressively investing in the online channel, 2) vulnerability to future Google algorithm
changes, 3) decelerating user growth, resulting in eCommerce market share losses, and
4) currency risk including FX volatility impact on cross border trade. The stock has been
subject to heavy volatility in the past based on GMV growth and market share trends
and this volatility could increase due to economic uncertainty.
Expedia (EXPE)
Our $146 price objective is based on our sum of the parts (SOP) that assumes 9x 2018E
EBITDA for the core OTA business (a discount to Priceline at approx. 15x due to slower
organic growth and higher taxes on earnings), 8x 2018E EBITDA for Egencia (we expect
single digit growth), 60% ownership of Trivago (using our PO), and HomeAway at 15x
2018 EV/EBITDA.
Downside risks to our PO are: 1) economic downturn leading to fewer travel bookings, 2)
competition for European traffic lowering the company's growth or margin opportunity,
3) hotels favoring lower-cost alternative distribution channels and limiting Expedia's
access to inventory, 4) Google and/or TripAdvisor disintermediation, and 5) the negative
impact of terrorism and disease on global travel trends.
Facebook (FB)
Our $165 price objective is based on 24x our non-GAAP 2018E EPS and 27x GAAP EPS,
multiples equal to about 1x 2018E revenue growth, mostly in-line with its social and
online media peers.
Risks are: 1) high valuation that discounts strong growth, 2) changes in user
engagement impacts optimism on revenue opportunities and compresses the stock
multiple, 3) privacy issues or pushback on Facebook's policy changes impact revenue
generation, 4) risks to executing Messenger & WhatsApp monetization, 5) potential for
higher investment to negatively impact margins, and 6) a macroeconomic impact on
advertising pricing.
Fitbit (FIT)
Our $6.50 price objective is based on 0.5x EV/S multiple which is below the device
manufacturer peer group at 1.8x, but justified in our view given declining revenue and
profitability, FCF burn, market saturation, and limited visibility into the next product cycle.
Upside risks are: 1) international product launches and expansion, 2) higher-thanexpected
ASPs, 3) new product launches domestically, 4) slower-than-expected OpEx
ramp, 5) software monetization and 6) corporate wellness program growth.
54 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017
Downside risks are: 1) integration risk from smartwatches and other wearables
cannibalizing the fitness tracker market, 2) fad risk, as fitness trackers could be simply a
fitness fad with consumers, 3) competitive risk from competitors out-innovating, and 4)
execution risk on channel build and inventory management.
GoPro (GPRO)
Our $8 price objective is based on 10x our 2018E EBITDA, in line with the peer average
of 10x, which we believe is appropriate given its slightly higher growth and potential for
EBITDA margin expansion after restructuring. GoPro is the leading action camera
company in the world but has been challenged by execution issues limiting its ability to
drive strong product cycles.
Downside risks to our PO are: 1) new products fail to resonate with consumers, 2)
competitive pressure pushing down ASPs, and 3) failure to meet market demand during
holidays.
Upside risks to our PO are: 1) better than expected sales on new products, 2) better than
expected holiday sales from extra manufacturing capacity, 3) better than expected drone
sales, or new product announcements, and 4) new direct sales partnerships
internationally
GrubHub (GRUB)
Our PO is $49, based on 32x our 2018E P/E (vs. high growth internet at 31x). We believe
GRUB warrants a premium to eCommerce peers due to the attractive margins of the
core business and, relative to the overall small-cap sector, GRUB has more attractive
margins and growth potential.
Downside risks to our PO are:
Revenue and sales metrics are trailing KPIs for Diners and Restaurant and the potential
for diminishing returns on future restaurant and user additions is a risk. GrubHub has
significant room for growth in the US ahead, but will need to invest internationally if
domestic growth stalls.
LendingTree (TREE)
Our $140 price objective represents 14x 2018E EV/EBITDA, a premium to the lead
generation services and marketplace peer group average of 11x due to market position
(category leader in mortgage and personal loans) and faster revenue growth.
Risks to achieving our estimates and price objective are: 1) interest rate risks given the
demand for leads for mortgage and other loan products, 2) competition with other
consumer finance sites and ad networks, 3) potential for search engine
disintermediation and traffic competition, 4) potential for recessionary impact on loan
products (lower traffic and demand for leads) and credit card markets, 5) premium
valuation vs. lead generation and marketplace peers, and 6) acquisition risk.
Match Group (MTCH)
Our PO is $21 based on 12x our estimated 2018 EBITDA of $562mn and our DCF
valuation analysis. The basis for our PO is in-line with the eCommerce group, but a
premium to the consumer internet subscription services group due to MTCH's
combination of market dominance, profitability, and cash flow. We think fundamentals
help MTCH stand out from its ecommerce peer group and MTCH should be seen as a
more defensible platform that is unlikely to see disruption in its core markets.
Downside risks are: market share losses to an emerging dating business, potential for
higher acquisition costs on mobile, lower conversion rates that lead to lower PMC
growth, the need to acquire competing sites to maintain growth or market share, and
Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 55
higher-than-expected International investments. The biggest downside risk is lower
revenue if Tinder experiences a decline in popularity or public perception.
Netflix, Inc. (NFLX)
Our $154 price objective is based on a peak penetration sum-of-the-parts analysis
which discounts back future EPS at peak penetration by 10%. At peak penetration, we
assume domestic streams peak at 65mn subscribers in five years while the international
segment reaches 200mn seven years later. We assume APRU of $9.99 and 40%
contribution margins for the domestic business and a $8.50 APRU and 40% contribution
margin for the international business. We also assume a $1.50 price increase
domestically over six years and a $3.60 price increase internationally over twelve years
which will be 75% incremental to operating income. We assume a US tax rate of 40%
and an international tax rate of 25%. At peak penetration, we assume a 15x S&P
average multiple.
Downside risks to our price objective are: 1) increasing content costs, 2) potential new
competitors in the company's streaming business, 3) execution challenges and
competition potentially limiting growth in new markets, 4) U.S. saturation point
approaching quicker than expected, and 5) net neutrality repeal causing ISPs to look to
recoup higher rents from Netflix's high bandwidth requirements for streaming.
Upside risks to our price objective are: 1) content costs rising slower than expected, 2)
total subscriber growth is faster than expected, and 3) international expansion into new
large markets (e.g. China).
OnDeck Capital (ONDK)
Our $6 price objective is based on 10x our 2018E EBITDA. This is below the internet
ecommerce comparable group (11x) which is justified in our view given OnDeck's double
digit revenue growth and potential to expand margins starting in 2018 as it gains scale
and operating leverage, but tempered by a slower FY18.
Upside risks to our PO are: 1) faster than expected originations growth, 2) signing of
new large strategic partners, and 3) lower than expected operating expenses.
Downside risks to our PO are: 1) higher than expected loss rates from worsening macro
environment, 2) credit market freeze shutting down liquidity access, 3) lower effective
yield from competition, and 4) increased marketing spend.
Pandora Media, Inc. (P)
Our $9 price objective is based on 1x our 2018 revenue estimate, a significant discount
to online media and subscription service peers, but justified in our view as the multiple
takes into account the company's difficult transition to a subscription on-demand
service and lack of near term profitability balanced by the value of its data and user
base.
Upside risks to our PO are: 1) direct licensing agreements for lower royalty rates, 2)
international expansion announcements, 3) ad-load increases in key demos, increasing
monetization rates, 4) faster than expected launch of on-demand service, and 5) the
company is acquired.
Downside risks to our PO are: 1) emerging competition from both other Internet models
like Spotify and Apple Music, as well as large, established radio companies like
iHeartMedia embracing Internet streaming, 2) slow down in the company's ability to
grow monetization, 3) lack of historical or near-term GAAP profitability, and 4) delayed
on-demand service launch
56 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017
priceline.com (PCLN)
Our price objective is $1,920 based on 22x our 2018 adj. EPS estimate. The 22x
multiple is towards the upper end of Priceline's historical multiple range of 13-23x and
represents a PEG of 1.4x. We think a 22x forward P/E multiple is appropriate given midteens
EPS growth, strong booking trends, Priceline's leadership position in the global
online travel sector, track record of EPS upside, and increased access to the China
market via the Ctrip investment.
Risks to our PO are 1) a global economic downturn, especially macro-weakness in
Europe, leading to fewer travel bookings and pressure on room rates, 2) competition for
traffic lowering the company's growth or margin opportunity, 3) hotels favoring their
own distribution channels, 4) FX volatility, 5) increased competition from Expedia,
TripAdvisor and potentially Google, and 6) the impact of terrorism/disease on global
travel trends. The stock has been subject to heavy volatility in the past based on travel
industry trends and this volatility could increase due to greater economic uncertainty,
especially with macro-trends in Europe.
Quotient Technology Inc (QUOT)
Our $13 price objective is based on a 16x 2018E EBITDA, a premium to eCommerce
peers (11x), which we think is justified given stickiness of the Retailer IQ platform and
the slightly higher growth of 14% in FY17 vs. eCommerce group at 11%). Quotient is a
lead operator in online couponing, has a strong technological platform, relationships
with CPGs and a platform that is slowly spreading across grocers in the U.S.
Downside risks are: 1) further delays in point-of-sale system rollout with retailers, 2)
loss of major retailers or CPG, 3) higher-than-expected R&D and S&M costs due to
investment, and 4) limited float may contribute to volatility.
Upside risks to our analysis are: 1) additional retailers launching on their point-of-sale
system, 2) quicker-than-expected transition to digital couponing, 3) new additional
digital coupon retail clients (such as Walmart). and 4) targeted couponing lifting average
transaction pricing.
Snap (SNAP)
Our $25 PO is based on our DCF model as we do not expect the company to be
profitable until mid- to late-2019 and any earnings-based valuation exercise would
require discounting back future earnings. Our DCF assumes approximately $28bn
revenue by 2027 based on 525mn DAUs and $50+ in ARPU. Our PO implies 15.5x EV /
Revenue, above the peer group at 4x, as we believe Snap's early stage of ad
monetization and potential future leverage in the business model warrants a premium
valuation multiple to the social media group.
Upside risks to our PO are: 1) greater than expected reacceleration in North America
DAU growth, 2) more rapid monetization of existing user base with increased ad load
and/or new ad formats, and 3) better traction and monetization in International markets.
Downside risks to our PO are: 1) further deceleration in user growth that would raise
concerns on long-term revenue opportunity, 2) pressure on usage due to competing
services, and 3) performance into the first lock-up expiration on 7/29/17.
TripAdvisor (TRIP)
Our price objective of $40 is based on 25x our 2018 non-GAAP EPS estimate. This
multiple represents a modest premium to the group for possibly depressed margins and
re-accelerating top-line growth.
Downside risks to our price objective are: 1) increasing competition (e.g. Yelp), 2) macroeconomic
factors (e.g. recession in Europe) impacting the travel industry, 3) challenges
Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 57
to the credibility of online reviews, 4) Instant Book transition puts pressure on revenue
growth, and 5) mobile monetization headwinds.
Upside risks to our price objective are: 1) improved mobile monetization 2) major OTA
sign on for instant booking 3) high non-hotel shopper dollar capture and 4) improved
global macro environment.
Trivago NV (TRVG)
Our PO of $15 is based on a 3.5x 2018E EV/Sales multiple. We note that 3.5x is roughly
in line with the lead generation peer group average 2018E EV/Sales multiple. We think
our EV/Sales multiple is warranted as a balance between Trivago's higher growth and
lower profitability. Our price objective is supported by our DCF analysis.
Downside risks to our price objective are: 1) Growing competition, 2) Elevated marketing
spend, 3) High Customer concentration, 4) Macro and FX risks, and 5) Potential for loss
of hotel inventory.
Twitter (TWTR)
Our $14.5 price objective is based on 12x our 2018 EBITDA estimate, which reflects a
discount to the online media group (13x). We believe the Twitter platform has slowing
user and revenue growth and as such, we expect the stock to trade at a sustained
discount to online media peers, with potential M&A adding some offsetting downside
support.
Downside risks to our PO are: 1) decelerating user growth that may raise concerns on
long-term revenue opportunity, 2) pressure on usage due to emergence of competing
services, 3) new ad initiatives may not perform well, resulting in lower advertiser
demand for Twitter ads, 4) monetization of logged-out users and third party application
users are slow to materialize, and 5) on a EV/EBITDA basis Twitter is more attractive
today than in the past, but stock remains subject to multiple compression.
Upside risks to our PO are: 1) User adds could ramp on new product initiatives in the 2H,
and accelerating user growth may increase optimism on long-term revenue opportunity,
2) with new demographic targeting initiatives, Twitter is able to capture more TV dollars
(vs online ad dollars) that are incremental with video ads, 3) the NFL broadcasts and
other video content (live political, entertainment, etc.) could help Twitter grow users
meaningfully in the long term, 4) guidance could prove to be conservative, 5) traction
from monetization of logged-out users and 6) potential that Twitter could be acquired.
Wayfair (W)
Our price objective of $44 is based on 0.7x 2018E EV/sales. We continue to focus on
EV/Sales given Wayfair's lack of profitability to date. Our 0.7x target multiple is a
discount to W's eCommerce comp group and at a modest discount to W's retail comp
group. We think the multiple is appropriate given stronger revenue growth vs. peers,
balanced by lower profitability and competitive risks.
Downside risks are: 1) GAAP operating losses expected through 2018, making valuation
analysis more complex, 2) competition from several well capitalized companies including
Amazon, 3) brand complexity (5 brands), 4) category limitations, 5) partner segment
revenue headwinds, and 6) execution risk on International expansion.
Yahoo! (YHOO)
Our price objective of $57 is based on our sum-of-parts valuation assumptions. Our $53
estimated asset value represents $39/share from the remaining Alibaba stake (using
$122 Alibaba valuation {10% discount rate, mid-term FCF FY18-25E CAGR of 18%, 4%
terminal growth} x 384mn shares at 20% discount rate), $6.1 for Yahoo Japan, $0.5 for
Excalibur patents, and $6.9 in cash and cash equivalents on Yahoo's balance sheet. We
58 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017
assume $4.7/share in value for the core business based Verizon's pending acquisition
value of $4.83bn less $300mn for potential revisions.
Downside risks to our PO are: 1) Alibaba stock valuation declines, 2) Alibaba valuation
discount is higher than expected, 3) Verizon's pending acquisition of Yahoo core assets
is delayed/challenged, 4) valuation of Yahoo! Japan falls, and 5) valuation of Excalibur
patent portfolio falls.
Yelp (YELP)
Our $43 price objective is based on 14x 2018E EV/EBITDA, slightly above online media
comps, which we believe is warranted given the higher margin potential in the model.
We believe our multiple balances premium growth vs peers with medium-term concerns
on competition and limited GAAP profitability. We believe the slight premium valuation
is sustainable if the company can continue to deliver 25% y/y topline growth with y/y
margin improvement.
Downside risks are Google and Facebook's ambitions to build a review ecosystem to tap
into local ad spending, competition from a variety of online and offline locally focused
advertising businesses, Google traffic dependency, and advertiser churn.
Zillow (ZG / Z)
Our $42 price objective is based on a 6x our 2018E EV/Sales and supported by our DCF
valuation. Our multiple is roughly in-line for online real estate lead generation sites in
other countries operating in developed countries. In addition, this multiple represents a
relative discount given Zillow's higher sales growth and a larger US TAM in comparison
to its peers in smaller developed markets like Australia and Japan. We are positive on
Zillow's long term opportunity to capture the majority of realtor's dollars moving from
offline channels to online marketing channels.
Downside risks are: 1) traffic cannibalization between Zillow properties, 2) new lawsuits
again Zillow, 3) potential for multiple compression, 4) a U.S. housing market down turn,
and 5) lack of profitability support for valuation.
Upside risks are: 1) faster than expected growth and S&M leverage, 2) Zillow Digg
monetization, 3) accelerated grow the in rentals market, and 4) new market expansion.
ZYNGA (ZNGA)
Our $2.70 PO is now based on 11x 2018E EBITDA (which is a premium to the Mobile
gaming peer group due to margin expansion potential), plus $1.41/share in cash and
assets (building).
Downside risks to our price objective are mobile market share losses, challenges in
establishing successful new content given employee departures, and player churn due to
greater competition given low barriers to entry. Upside risks are successful new title
releases that accelerate growth, or potential acquisition of Zynga for its game portfolio.

pain points to something unusual about my constitution. Maybe there's a reason it's
harder for me to have orgasms than the average woman.

But the vaginal pain itself is not overwhelming, on the rare occasions that it crops up.
And the vaginal pain is not even close to the most central issue of my sexuality -- or the
biggest influence on my orgasmic ability.

TK OK ok

I. S&M

I identify my sexuality as BDSM -- a.k.a. kink, leather, fetish, S&M, or B&D. BDSM is a
6-for-4 acronym that encompasses a host of related activities, including bondage,
discipline, dominance, submission, sadism and masochism. And yeah, I'm really into it:
my desires are heavy and overwhelming; I dream of agony, of terrified screams for
mercy. I've gone so far as to describe BDSM as my sexual orientation.

Before someone goes leaping to conclusions, there is a definite difference between good
pain and bad pain.” The occasional pain I feel within my vagina is not good pain; it's
not even interesting. It's just annoying. It's not sexy or enjoyable at all.

Some of us in the BDSM community have felt lifelong tendencies towards BDSM. We
have conversations ending with thrilled exclamations: You mean, you tied up your
Barbie dolls as a child too?! But BDSM is widely misunderstood and negatively
stereotyped, and thus, many of us also went through periods of rejection. We've
internalized so much anti-BDSM stigma from society that, at times, we freak out. We
deny or erase our BDSM desires.

That's what happened to me when I was in middle school. As my sexuality made itself
more and more evident, my anxiety peaked. I'd been producing secret sadomasochistic art
and stories without labeling what I was doing, but I stopped. I blockaded my thoughts of
violent power-play. I closed it all away as thoroughly as I could.

I still felt sexual desire -- I mean, I was entering my teens, so of course I did. Sometimes I
felt so much desire, like in the middle of some inconvenient class, that I'd have to rest my
burning forehead on the cold desk. I would close my eyes, and breathe deeply, and wait
for the erotic shiver to pass. At home, I'd lie around my twin bed and dream about kisses;
imagine men's hair and skin and touch.

Yet it was hard for me to trace my desire, to take control of it. I thought I had no problem
with the idea of masturbation, but when I touched my own lady bits, I went cold.
Vibrators did nothing but bore me.

I had excellent sex education, thank goodness. I went through a Unitarian Universalist
sex education program that talked carefully about different experiences, that made space
for gay and lesbian and bisexual and transgender and queer folks. I didn't only learn
about sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy and condom usage; I was also
encouraged to explore my sexuality, to value it. But this marvelous curriculum did not
include BDSM and other non-standard sexual identities. Nor did it include much advice
on how to negotiate sexual encounters with my partners. So, although I internalized many

the community out trying to find her, and she was known as such

in her community. So to say somehow that we can't talk about

her reputation for truth telling, her reputation for honesty at

the time she was a child when she claims that she was the

victim of sex abuse, is not supported by the law.

Plaintiff also cites to Sack on Defamation, and I

believe the cite is 10, Section 5. And your Honor, I think
this helps clarify a lot of what our position is in this case.
Sack believes, as we do, that it is entirely

appropriate under 405(b) to question a plaintiff who has

alleged defamation, whose reputation is an issue about all
kinds of bad acts. They have said, just now, that there is
just no reason we should be allowed to ask about all these

other bad acts.

Sack cites, your Honor, to an Eleventh CircuLt case,

Schafer vs. Time, Inc. In that case, your Honor, Sack says the

Eleventh Circuit found the district court had been correct when

it ruled that the defendant, which allegedly accused the
plaintiff of being a traitor, would be permitted to question
the plaintiff about a felony conviction, a possible violation
of his subsequent parole, convictions for driving under the
influence, an arrest for writing a bad check, failure to file

tax returns, failure to pay alimony and child support, and

vidence concerning plaintiff's efforts to change his name and

together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry and violence... . We must rediscover the
bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans... . Racism is evil. And
those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs including the KKK, neo-
Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold
dear as Americans.”

It was a reluctant mini-grovel. It was something of a restaging of the take-it-back
birther speech about Obama during the campaign: much distraction and obfuscation, then
a mumbled acknowledgment. Similarly, he looked here, trying to tow the accepted line on
Charlottesville, like a kid called on the carpet. Resentful and petulant, he was clearly
reading forced lines.

And in fact he got little credit for these presidential-style remarks, with reporters
shouting questions about why it had taken him so long to address the issue. As he got back
on Marine One to head to Andrews Air Force Base and on to JFK and then into Manhattan
and Trump Tower, his mood was dark and I-told-you-so. Privately, he kept trying to
rationalize why someone would be a member of the KK K—that is, they might not actually
believe what the KKK believed, and the KKK probably does not believe what it used to
believe, and, anyway, who really knows what the KKK believes now? In fact, he said, his
own father was accused of being involved with the KK K—not true. (In fact, yes, true.)

The next day, Tuesday, August 15, the White House had a news conference scheduled
at Trump Tower. Bannon urged Kelly to cancel it. It was a nothing conference anyway. Its
premise was about infrastructure—about undoing an environmental regulation that could
help get projects started faster—but it was really just another effort to show that Trump
was working and not just on a holiday. So why bother? What’s more, Bannon told Kelly,
he could see the signs: the arrow on the Trump pressure cooker was climbing, and before
long he’d blow.

The news conference went ahead anyway. Standing at the lectern in the lobby of
Trump Tower, the president stayed on script for mere minutes. Defensive and self-
justifying, he staked out a contrition-is-bunk, the-fault-lies-everywhere-else position and
then dug in deep. He went on without an evident ability to adjust his emotions to political
circumstance or, really, even to make an effort to save himself. It was yet one more
example, among his many now, of the comic-absurd, movielike politician who just says
whatever is on his mind. Unmediated. Crazylike.

“What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, altright? Do they have
any semblance of guilt? What about the fact they came charging with clubs in their hands?
As far as I’m concerned that was a horrible, horrible day... . I think there’s blame on both
sides. I have no doubt about it, you don’t have any doubt about it. If you reported it
accurately, you would see.”

He chose music and television producers as his market because he is a musician himself and has used
these products.

2. Product Brainstorm

He chose the most popular products available for resale from the largest manufacturers of sound libraries
and arranged a wholesale purchase and drop-ship agreement with them. Many of these libraries cost well
above $300 (up to $7,500), and this is precisely why he needs to answer more customer-service
questions than someone with a lower-priced product of $50—200.

3. Micro-Testing

He auctioned the products on eBay to test demand (and the highest possible pricing) before purchasing
inventory. He ordered product only when people placed orders from him, and product shipped
immediately from the manufacturers’ warehouses. Based on this demand confirmed on eBay, Doug
created a Yahoo Store with these products and began testing Google Adwords and other PPC search
engines.

4. Rollout and Automation

Following this testing, and upon generating sufficient cash flow, Doug began experimenting with print
advertising in trade magazines. Simultaneously, he streamlined and outsourced operations to reduce his
time requirements from two hours per day to two hours per week.

=» COMFORT CHALLENGE

Rejecting First Offers and Walking Away (3 Days)

Before performing this exercise, if possible, read the bonus chapter “How to Get $700,000 of
Advertising for $10,000” on our companion site, and then set aside two hours on a consecutive Saturday,
Sunday, and Monday.

On Saturday and Sunday, go to a farmers’ market or other outdoor event where goods are sold. If this
isn’t possible, go to small independent retailers (not chains or mass retail).

Set a budget of $100 for your negotiating tuition and look for items to purchase that total at least $150.
Your job is to get the sellers down to a total of $100 or less for the lot. It is better to practice on many
cheap items rather than a few big items. Be sure to reply to their first offer with, “What type of discount
can you offer?” to let them negotiate against themselves. Negotiate near closing time, choose your
objective price, bracket, and make a firm offer with cash in hand for that amount® Practice walking
away if your objective price isn’t met. On Monday, call two magazines (expect the first to be awkward)
and use the script on the companion site to negotiate, minus the last firm offer. Get them as low as
possible and then call them back later to indicate that your proposal was refused by upper management
or otherwise vetoed.

This is the negotiating equivalent of paper trading.42 Get used to refusing offers and countering in
person and— most importantly —on the phone.

The NSA also saw its sources disappearing from its surveillance.
Before the Snowden breach, the FBI, the CIA, and the DIA, which
were the NSA’s partners in the PRISM program, had compiled a
watch list of highly active foreign terrorist targets for the NSA’s
PRISM program. These “targets” included logistics officers, bomb
builders, weapons specialists, and suicide bomber recruiters. Until
June 6, 2013, many of these targets had frequently used Internet
services, such as Twitter, Facebook, and Xbox Live, to send what they
believed would be hidden messages. After the PRISM story broke
in The Washington Post on June 6, the NSA “saw one after another
target go dark,” according to a senior NSA executive involved in
that surveillance. The NSA has watched about one thousand of
these targets take “steps to remove themselves from our visibility.”
According to the NSA’s deputy director, Richard Ledgett, in 2016,

© the vanishings included a group planning attacks in Europe and the ©
United States.

Admiral Rogers, the new NSA director, was asked about the dam-
age done by Snowden. He was blunt and direct. Asked in February
2015 whether or not the disclosures by Snowden had reduced the
NSA’s ability to pursue terrorists, he answered, “Have I lost capabil-
ity that we had prior to the revelations? Yes.”

Dear Mr. Lefkowitz,

RE:

Subject 
Here are the questions I'd like to ask Jeffrey Epstein. 
Would he be available to answer any of these on the 
phone or by email? People have told me some of his 
thoughts on background but I wanted to see if he could 
tell me or email me anything directly I could use on 
the record. Also I'd like to run the information I 
already have by you or him. 
Thank you, 
Alexandra 
-What is he chiefly focusing on now? Is he spending 
more time on The Jeffrey Epstein Science Foundation? 
Could he talk about his interest in science and the 
2011 grants/conference? 
-How has his business been affected? Is there any new 
direction he's taking it? Does he still have the same 
clients or new ones? Is it still at $15 billion? 
-Did he still work while in prison? How was that 
arranged? With whom was he working/advising? 
-Where is he spending his time now? How has his social 
life changed from three years ago? 
-Is he still close with Ghislaine Maxwell? 
-What were friends/colleagues/acquaintances reactions 
to his conviction? 
-What does he think about the sentence he got- was it 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 019409 
too lenient or too harsh and why? 
-What is his side of the story and have people been 
supportive? 
-Is he continuing the charity initiatives he started

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028655.txt,"The most effective resolution would be a negotiated outcome -- to achieve
it, Washington will need to take preliminary steps on several fronts. A
serious compromise needs to be put on the table, including an offer to
suspend crippling oil sanctions in return for specific, verifiable Iranian
steps to eliminate any nuclear breakout capabilities. Equally significant is
establishing a credible military threat, given that Tehran has been willing
to endure increasing economic pressure in order to continue its nuclear
program. The regime is unlikely to concede anything during negotiations
if it does not believe that Washington will actually follow through on such
threats. Although specific public redlines are often unpalatable, the Obama
administration must clarify internally when it would take military steps,
and these intentions must be made clear to the Iranians.

In the same vein, the military option requires a credible negotiating
complement, as seen in the early 1990s with Iraq. To legitimize military
action against Saddam Hussein's regime, Washington had to prove that all
other options had been exhausted. Similarly, the only way to set the
predicate for military action against Iran is to show the regime and the
international community that everything has been tried, and that
Washington has left Tehran with a way out. Failure to do so would
undermine the legitimacy of any strikes.

It is also important to understand that curtailing Iran's nuclear progress
will not by itself alter the regime's regional agenda -- nuclear ambitions
are but an extension of Tehran's wider aspirations toward hegemony in the
Middle East. Unfortunately, none of the longer-term proposals for
addressing that issue seem feasible at the moment (e.g., regime change by
internal or external means; a shift in Tehran's views on the Supreme
Leader and succession; a grand deal between Washington, Iran, and the
international community).

One lesson to be learned from past interactions with Tehran (or lack
thereof) is that when the United States proactively opposes Iranian
aggression in the Middle East, the regime relents, but when Washington
offers a more passive response, Iranian aggression increases. With respect
to Syria, for example, it cannot be assumed that Bashar al-Assad will fall
at all, let alone quickly, without active U.S. engagement. If the Assad

policy, and government, based on trusted data about current conditions. This second
thread depends on availability of trusted data and so is just beginning to be developed.
Trusted data and data-driven assessment of norms, policy, and government together
create a credit-assignment function that improves societies’ overall fitness and
intelligence.

It is precisely at the point of creating greater societal intelligence where fake
news, propaganda, and advertising all get in the way. Fortunately, trust networks give us
a path forward to building a society more resistant to echo-chamber problems, these fads,
these exercises in madness. We have begun to develop a new way of establishing social
measurements, in aid of curing some of the ills we see in society today. We’re using
open data from all sources, encouraging a fair representation of the things people are
choosing, in a curated mathematical framework that can stamp out the echoes and the
attempts to manipulate us.

On Polarization and Inequality

Extreme polarization and segregation by income are almost everywhere in the world
today and threaten to tear governments and civil society apart. Increasingly, the media
are becoming adrenaline pushers driven by advertising clicks and failing to deliver
balanced facts and reasoned discourse—and the degradation of media is causing people
to lose their bearings. They don’t know what to believe, and thus they can easily be
manipulated. There is a real need to ground our various cultures in trustworthy, data-
driven standards that we all agree on, and to be able to know what behaviors and policies
work and which don’t.

In converting to a digital society, we’ve lost touch with traditional notions of truth
and justice. Justice used to be mostly informal and normative. We’ve now formalized it.
At the same time, we’ve put it out of reach for most people. Our legal systems are failing
us in a way they didn’t before, precisely because they’re now more formal, more digital,
less embedded in society.

Ideas about justice are very different around the world. One of the core
differentiators is this: Do you or your parents remember when the bad guys came with
guns and took everything? If you do, your attitude about justice is different from that of
the average reader of this essay. Do you come from the upper classes? Or were you
somebody who saw the sewers from the inside? Your view of justice depends on your
history.

A common test I have for U.S. citizens is this: Do you know anybody who owns a
pickup truck? It’s the number-one-selling vehicle in the United States, and if you don’t
know people like that, you’re out of touch with more than 50 percent of Americans.
Physical segregation drives conceptual segregation. Most of America thinks of justice
and access and fairness in terms very different from those of the typical, say,
Manhattanite.

If you look at patterns of mobility—where people go—in a typical city, you find
that the people in the top quintile (white-collar working families) and bottom quintile
(people who are sometimes on unemployment or welfare) almost never talk to each other.
They don’t go to the same places; they don’t talk about the same things. They all live in

Rationale

Close position as the hurdle to surprise on the upside is high following a 5.8% NKY rally
Close position as Facebook rallied on better-than expected Q2 results

Close position as Amazon rallied on better-than expected Q2 results

Remove protection as worries around disappointing Q4 guidance faded post earnings

The BoJ, Fed & EU bank stress tests could move mkts sharply in the near term

Unwinding before the Aug16 expiry; The NKY Sep put spread has carried well

Telstra has announced earnings and the stock has corrected 5% over the period
NCM has stayed unchanged over the period despite better than expected earnings
CSL fell 5.4% over the period with weak earnings announcement

BHP rose 3.6% over the period but the option remains out of the money

Close position as the HSCEI rallies 5.2% and we are approaching the Aug16 expiry
Tencent jumped post better than expected earnings

SX7E 1M 25d call / SX5E 1M 25d call price ratio is in the 100 2-yr percentile

Close position and BofA ML turned neutral in EM in the short-term
Close position and BofA ML turned neutral in EM in the short-term
Close position and BofA ML turned neutral in EM in the short-term

Close positions from trades that have benefited thus far from the rally in Financials and weakness
in Utilities; monetize view that Fed will not hike in September

Take advantage of low near term vol and a steep term structure

Unwind Oct/Jan spread and maintain Nov/Jan spread given clarity around the Italian referendum
date
Global macro event risk likely to keep V2X supported going into Sep expiry

Trade provided hedging benefits during the sudden Sep market shock & has expired

Take a loss post an disappointing market reaction on the BoJ announcement
Take a loss post an disappointing market reaction on the BoJ announcement
Trade expired on 3-Oct

Our analysts no longer expect impactful catalysts in the near term; stock replacement strategies
proved useful in cushioning downside losses during the abrupt Sep-16 sell-off vs. long equity
positions.

HKEx failed to rally above the first call strike and expired worthless

NKY Oct-16 call expired out of the money

Close position as the Oct VIX future stayed well-supported as is typically the case in the weeks
leading up to the US presidential election

Provided hedging benefits in the sudden equity shock in early Sep-16; now being unwound to
mitigate decay

DAX outperformance & low short dated DAX vol make put calendars attractive
A catalyst-strewn fall and a remarkably low volatility summer suggests that there could be
headwinds to continued market upside on low volatility

Monetise steep SX5E vol curve for tactical EU upside with an upfront credit

Take a loss as safe-haven assets post a weak performance in H2-16 with fears over Trump's
surprise victory easing and stock markets rallying

Add exposure via inexpensive upside on single names where positioning appears particularly
bearish and stocks have underperformed vs. their sectors

Near term catalysts & curve differentials favour tactical long V2X, short VIX puts
Close short SX7E call (part of SX5E put spread, short SX7E call trade) to limit potential risk from a
“Yes” in the Italian referendum

National Enquirer

Tellingly, many of those articles — which have notably increased in tempo in recent weeks following Roberts’ late December
accusation that noted attorney Alan Dershowitz was one of the men she was forced to have sex with — contain language
underscoring the fact that none of this proves anything. “It should at this stage be stressed that the Mail has no evidence to
corroborate this and other claims made by Virginia Roberts,” the Dai/y Mai/ wrote in April. “Though her LinkedIn page claims a
certificate in Swedish massage, there is no evidence that she ever actually treated Epstein to one,” Gawker (in the most
straightforward and clearest reporting on the documents to date) wrote last week. And the National Enquirer did not appear to rely
on the court record for its conclusions, instead to the interpretation of an unnamed source who noted that “Bill’s name is all over the

legal papers, which are chock-full of sordid claims.”

Clinton’s discretion on matters of sexual restraint has attained permanent notoriety, so maybe it’s natural to assume that particular

leopard doesn’t change his spots. But at this point, there is simply nothing to back those sordid claims up.
Here’s what we do know:

Jeffrey Epstein is a secretive billionaire financier and Democratic donor who says he never attended college but whose “background
is in physics.” He owns properties in New York, Florida, New Mexico, London, and Paris and also owns an island in the U.S. Virgin

Islands. He has at least two private jets, including the 727.

He has known Bill Clinton since about 1995, and his relationship with him grew stronger after he left office. There is no question they
were friendly. Epstein’s so-called “black book,” which is less like something out of the Heidi Fleiss affair and more what most people

would call a “phone directory,” contains 21 numbers for getting in touch with Clinton, as well as emails and addresses.

But that 92-page directory also contains exactly the range of eye-poppingly famous and powerful contacts one might expect of an

incredibly rich, connected person who owns Manhattan’s largest private residence, from Tony Blair to Elie Wiesel to Courtney Love.

Epstein was long rumored to be a sexual libertine; “It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do,” real estate

personality Donald Trump once said of his old friend. “And many of them are on the younger side.”

= A key criterion in the development of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is the time Iran needs to
produce enough weapon-grade uranium for a nuclear weapon, called breakout time. Iran agreed to refine uranium to
no more than 3.7% enrichment and eliminated its stocks of weapons-grade 20%-enriched uranium.

For social media updates... Are you currently doing these? I'd like to look at how often we are doing them and
trying to link to our own content more often.

I'm also exploring if we can get this new site included in Google News and maybe syndicate other important

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021248.txt,"Invisible Forces and Unseen Powers:
Gravity, Gods, and Minds

Preface

1. Invisible Forces Operating on Human
Bodies

Gravity is an invisible force that holds us
to the surface of the earth, and the fact
that gravity is invisible does not place it
beyond scientific scrutiny. Similarly,
humans are a quintessentially social
species whose need for social connection
produces invisible forces on our brain,
behavior, and biology that are subject to
scientific investigation. Among these are
forces that compel us to seek trusting and
meaningful connections with others and
to seek meaning and connection with
something bigger than ourselves. The
story of these invisible forces speaks to
who we are as a species.

From Selfish Genes to Social Brains

2. The Social Nature of Humankind
The human brain has evolved under the
guidance of selfish genes to produce
more than a brain that is capable of
powerful, isolated information
processing operations. The human brain
also evolved with inherent capacities for
social cognition, compassion, empathy,
bonding, coordination, cooperation,
values, mortality and a need for social
connection that extends beyond kin and
even other mdividuals.

From Inclusive Fitness to Spiritual
Striving

3. Science, Religion, and a Revised

Religious Humanism
The dialogue between science and
religion, if properly pursued, can usher in
a new era of religious humanism in the
leading world religions. Their central
beliefs and practices largely would
remain intact, but their views of nature
and their concerns with health and well-
being would be refined through their
conversations with the sciences. How

this model would work is discussed in
terms of the relation between love and
health in Christian theology — especially
the tension between the agape, caritas,
and eros models of Christian love.

The Status of the Body Politic and the
Status of the Body Itself

4. Health by Connection: From Social

Brains to Resilient Bodies
Most people feel socially connected most
of the time. Felt connectedness is
typically taken for granted, but the
effects of its absence, as experienced in
feelings of isolation, demonstrate that
our evolutionary heritage as a social
species has potent implications for health
and well-being.

From Relationships to People and
Groups to Relationships with God

5. Psychosomatic Relations: From

Superstition to Mortality
It has long been recognized that mental
states can impact health and well being,
but the causal pathways have only
recently begun to be understood.
Thoughts, beliefs and attitudes can have
powerful effects on physiological
functions, health and disease. Examples
range from superstitious beliefs
associated with voodoo, bone pointing,
or other black rituals to the more positive
states associated with spirituality. The
present essay considers these disparate
psychological states and how they might
translate into physiological effects
having real health implications.

The Mind and Body Are One

Consciousness and the Dissolution of
Self and Other Boundaries

Chirac, but the understanding was that Madeleine would be in charge. Far from
showing any willingness to end the violence, Arafat at first simply lied. He said the
Palestinian violence was in response to an unprovoked assault by Israeli troops,
and demanded an international “protection” force. There was a particularly bizarre
moment when I read out the names of individual Tanzim leaders whom we had
intercepted organizing the attacks. Arafat pretended he’d never heard of any of
them, almost as if I was reading from a zoology textbook about species of polar
bears. This was a man who had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. What he
really deserved was an Oscar.

But people were dying. Needlessly. We ended up agreeing to a US-led fact-
finding commission, as well as a number of steps to separate the Palestinian
attackers and Israeli units. I reaffirmed our policy of insisting that Israeli soldiers
use live fire only if they felt their lives were under threat. Arafat undertook to order
his security forces and Tanzim not to launch further attacks. He even phoned Gaza
with what we were given to understand were explicit orders. But it was all for
show, as we discovered when we were invited to the Elysée Palace to meet Chirac.
The French President had clearly received advance word from Arafat about his
demand for an international “protection” force, presumably with a role for the
French. To my surprise and frustration, and Secretary Albright’s as well, Chirac
insisted that no agreement was acceptable without that happening. Then, he turned
to me, demanding to know why the violence had left nearly 400 Palestinians dead,
but barely two dozen Israelis, if the Palestinians were the aggressors. “Mr
President,” I said, “just several weeks ago we were prepared to go very far in order
to put this entire conflict behind us. It is Mr Arafat who rejected the proposal, even
as a basis for negotiations. Just a basis to seek peace. He then deliberately turned to
terror. We are protecting ourselves, and our soldiers. Are you really saying that
you'll be happy for us to sign an agreement to end it only when another 350
Israelis are killed? I’m not playing that game. Arafat started this. He has to stop it.
We know he can, and we hold him responsible if that does not happen.”

It did not happen. We tried all we could to prevent a further deterioration. I
approved moves, in co-ordination with the Palestinian police, to lower our security
profile where possible. We made sure Israeli police were not visible from the
mosques on the Haram al-Sharif. But after the next Friday prayers, a crowd made
its way to a police post at the edge of the Old City and attacked it. In Nablus, the
burial site of Joseph had long been a source of tension. Shlomo Ben-Ami reached

Of course, a more constructive view of high
yield fundamentals does not necessarily suggest
robust returns. In high yield bonds, today’s below-
average spreads already reflect our subdued default
expectations and are less likely to offset any further
increase in rates. We thus expect returns of around
4% in the year ahead. Although high yield energy
is likely to generate similar gains, the potential
upside is more significant given wider starting
spreads and the potential for distressed bonds to
pull to par amid higher oil prices. Finally, with a
5% return, bank loans should perform marginally
better than bonds, reflecting their attractive
0.25-year duration and continued investor demand
for floating rates—a feature that is back in vogue
now that 3-month LIBOR is almost above the
1% LIBOR floor that more than 90% of bank
loans possess.

While these returns may pale in comparison to
those of last year, they remain attractive relative to
investment grade fixed income, where we expect
rising rates to generate lower returns. Even if rates
stagnate while US growth remains positive, the
default-adjusted return in high yield should still
trump high-quality bonds. Said differently, US
corporate high yield credit remains a better house
in a bad fixed income neighborhood, supporting
our modest overweight recommendation.

naturally bubbled away into clarity.

From E’Mei temple, with this fresh, clear-running mind, Nan began a quest to
sharpen his spirit even further. The journey took him, for nearly a decade, from
master to master in China, from monastery to university to rural huts. These were
the places where the last bits of some of China’s most ancient traditions had been
carried, places where classical wisdom had survived a hundred years of national
chaos. Nan’s wandering education resembled the way in which, in millennia past,
monks would make spiritual marathons around China, seeking an ever-sharper edge
to their insights. Solitary monks would stride into packed monasteries and engage
in tests of insight, contests to see who could feel the underlying nature of the world
with greater fidelity. The aim was, always, to touch the energy flows moving, just
unseen, below our lives. “Ten thousand kinds of clever talk—how can they be as
good as reality?” So the famous Ch’an master Yun Men, who himself trained four
great masters, faced down a King with pure silence in one such a battle.!

Nan was trying to cultivate in himself deep ways of feeling and sensing the world.
During his wandering study, he followed a path that would lead him to
enlightenment in more than a dozen different schools of Buddhism. He mastered
everything from medicine to calligraphy. His youthful success and energy at sword
fighting, it emerged, was a sign of a prodigal genius. He became, in the 20 century,
recognized as one of those crucial human vessels by which really ancient tradition is
preserved and carried forward for new generations.

After a few years of study, Nan saw the descending madness of Mao’s China and
slipped out of the mainland for Taiwan. He lived for decades between Taipei and
Hong Kong and America. During this time his fame as a teacher grew. In the mid-
1990s as China opened, Nan returned to the mainland. He had been invited by some
of China’s most powerful families, the children of communist revolutionaries who
were groping for a sense of history and identity. They wanted to absorb the lessons
of Chinese culture that Nan had internalized, they hoped to bend them into tools
they could use to shape a Chinese future. Might the old habits of the country, with
their ancient roots, have something to offer a nation nearly splitting with the
energies of modernity? Nan agreed to set up a private school. He selected a site on
the shores of Lake Tai in Zhejiang Province, not far from Shanghai. He chose the
location carefully: The still lake water near his campus was like a giant bath of
calming yin energy that balanced the urgent, uncertainly aggressive yang energy of
1990s China into a kind of harmony. Ash trees shaded the study rooms in the
summer. Wild peonies erupted in pink and white each spring.

1 So the famous Ch’an master: “Yun Men’s Every Day is a Good Day” in Thomas
Cleary, Secrets of the Blue Cliff Record: Zen Comments by Hakuin and Tenkei. (Boston,
Mass.: Shambhala, 2002) 39. Fir an excellent introduction to the thinking of Master
Nan, see Diamond Sutra Explained (Primodia Media 2007) and To Realize

Palm House Hotel, Related Companies Stephen Ross600


An affiliate of the Related Companies has emerged as the initial bidder for the Palm House Hotel as the failed condo-hotel project heads to a bankruptcy auction.

The stalking horse bidder, RREF II PALM HOUSE LLC, has the same address as Related Companies in New York and is led by Related Companies Managing Principal Justin Metz, according to a filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. The company is offering $32 million for the property, which will set the floor price for a bankruptcy auction scheduled for next month. Bids at the auction will start at $32.5 million.

The 79-unit condo-hotel project on Palm Beach Island stalled in 2014 and its former developer now faces allegations of fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission and a group of EB-5 investors. In August, the property filed for bankruptcy under its court appointed receiver with creditors claims totaling $115 million.

Cushman & Wakefield’s Robert Given, Errol Blumer, Michael Mulkern and Robert Kaplan are the exclusive marketing advisers for the property. The auction is scheduled for 10 a.m. on November 16, 2018 in West Palm Beach.

Given said he expects the property to sell for up to $40 million and it could be the last opportunity for a developer to own a hotel in the wealthy enclave of Palm Beach. He said the next owner will likely not redevelop the property. Instead, the best option would be to continue renovating the existing project which could take more than a year to complete, Given said.

By auctioning the project through a bankruptcy sale, it will be offered free and clear from any liens. The bankruptcy also means that the new owner will not have any responsibility for the issues stemming from EB-5 investors who had invested in the property.

The 82,648-square-foot project was first developed in 1961 and expanded in 1981. The property was set to be renovated by a group led by developer Robert Matthews.

Matthews then raised $44 million from EB-5 investors, according to a complaint by the Securities and Exchange Commission. EB-5 is a federal program that allows foreign investors the chance to gain a green card if they invest at least $500,000 into certain projects that create at least 10 jobs.

The SEC’s complaint said, however, that much of this money was misallocated to pay for Matthews’ personal expenses. Some of the funds allegedly went to pay for Mathews’ Connecticut home, his 151-foot mega yacht, as well as to save his Palm Beach mansion from foreclosure, according to the complaint.

In a separate lawsuit filed by a group of EB-5 investors, the development group claimed that famous celebrities and politicians such as Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Celine Dion and Bill Koch – would serve on the Palm House’s advisory board when, in fact, they did not.

Related Companies, led by Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross, developed CityPlace West Palm Beach. The company is also proposing to build a 25-story office project called One Flagler in downtown West Palm Beach.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018671.txt,"However, I think (or would like to think? augh) that most girls are not like that, and that
you should not plan for girls to be like that. I'd definitely rather offend someone by
asking than offend them by not asking.

Holly implies that people who don't like explicit communication should effectively be
banned from kissing: she says, they can go without ever being kissed until they wise
up.” I have a certain cantankerous sympathy for this perspective, and I have said similar
things myself in the past. But my research into pickup artists made me wonder about
whether this perspective is tenable, given a world in which most people seem to enjoy
and engage in a great deal of tacit communication.

Speaking only for myself, I must admit that I like it when a man can read my unspoken
signals well enough that he can tell when to kiss me without asking aloud. Sometimes it
can be nice when a guy asks. But if he can read my tacit communication about kissing,
that is a signal that he can read a lot of my other tacit communication as well.

Furthermore, if many people really enjoy unspoken social games and strategic
uncertainty, then the game will never go away. Evidence that people enjoy those things
does not only include the pickup artist subculture -- romantic comedies and romance
novels consistently find a market, after all.

Additionally, part of improving sexual communication means learning more about
unspoken communication -- not just spoken communication. The pioneering social
economist Peter F. Drucker once said, The most important thing in communication is to
hear what isn't being said. This maxim is no less true when it comes to sex than it is in
any other area of human endeavor. PUAs have spent years gathering information on tacit
sexual communication, so perhaps one feminist goal should be to try and understand what
they've learned, such as the characteristics of excellent social calibration.

Some feminists and BDSMers exist who already think a lot about teaching implicit or
unspoken communication. On the feminist side, one webpage about sexual violence
features an image of a woman saying: I stopped kissing you back. I pushed your hand
away. I said I wanted to leave. It all meant 'NO'. On the BDSM side, there is often an
expectation that BDSM partners will discuss their experience and reactions once they are
done doing BDSM with each other, so as to learn more about how to read each other's
tacit signals. However, I have never encountered a BDSM seminar on the topic of non-
verbal communication, though I've attended several on verbal communication.

My perspective on non-verbal communication is not without precedent among feminist
BDSMers, though my willingness to deal extensively with PUAs might be. Still, I believe
that non-verbal communication is not taught well, and that feminists and BDSMers in
particular do not spend enough time discussing its role in sexual interactions. Given that
both communities emphasize that consent and communication are crucially intertwined,
perhaps both communities might draw insight from some PUA conceptions of kino,
calibration and other ways of examining implicit communication.

I once started a thread about pickup artists on a major feminist blog, to which one
feminist responded: I'm getting so sick of these PUA threads.... So I'll just come out and
say it: PUAs rape women through coercion and manipulation. Full stop.”

Hi Steve, 
I am still intrigued and would like to meet Michael. I thinks it makes sense, though, for us to have a more 
specific conversation about compensation before I meet with him. I don't want to put the cart before the horse, 
but as I mentioned, this would be a big move for me, and it would have to make sense economically in addition 
to being the right move for other reasons we have discussed. 
I hope you are well. Cannot believe that Christie endorsed Trump!

many as possible of the Arab inhabitants to come under the authority of the
Palestinians, and as few as possible under our rule.” Amnon’s bottom line was that
we could not give up Israeli sovereignty over the Temple Mount, which, although
he was a non-observant Jew, he called “the cradle of Jewish history.” But equally,
we couldn’t and shouldn’t “run the Al-Aqsa mosque.” He was also in favor of
agreeing to what Clinton had asked of me: giving Arafat a base in the Muslim
Quarter of the Old City. His one caveat was that we should not do any of this
unless it was part of a genuine, final, peace agreement with the Palestinians.

Danny Yatom urged us to move beyond our emotions and look for a practical
solution. “We all know how the boundaries of Jerusalem were drawn,” he said,
referring to the post-1967 expansion of the city. “They’re not holy. It 1s important
to get down to our real red lines.” Eli Rubinstein, the attorney general, agreed.
Even though he was an observant, Orthodox Jew, and more sympathetic politically
to Likud than Labor, he concluded that we needed to include “as few Arabs as
possible” under Israeli sovereignty, and to cede the outer villages to the
Palestinians, adding: “This is a moment of truth.”

It was nearly five hours before I brought the discussion to a close. “This is as
grave a decision as when Ben-Gurion accepted the partition plan in 1947; the
declaration of the state; or the most tense moments of the Yom Kippur War,” I
said. “Or the decisions which Begin took in this same place.” Of course, Begin
hadn’t even been willing to enter into discussion on Jerusalem. But we were in a
different situation. If we were going to get a true end to our conflict, the question
of Jerusalem had to be addressed. “We can’t delay the decision. We can’t avoid it.
We will have to decide.” My own red line was the same as Amnon Lipkin’s:
“sovereignty over the site of our First and Second Temples.” Even shared
sovereignty elsewhere within the Old City seemed to me a step too far at this stage,
but I didn’t rule it out as part of a full peace. “Without disengagement from the
Palestinians, without an end of conflict,” I reminded our negotiating team, “we’re
heading toward further tragedy. We can’t pretend we don’t see the iceberg.”

I asked several members of the team, under Shlomo Ben-Ami, to draft a paper
based on our discussion. Since I knew that Clinton, and Arafat too, could do
nothing of substance until I'd resolved how far to go on Jerusalem, I went to see
the President. I told him about our session. I said that we were now crystallizing
what had been said into a formal position, and I hoped to be able to return in a few
hours with “the furthest point we can go.” Clinton said that would be a critical

Shevardnadze, a journalist for Russia Today television.

When Ms. Shevardnadze directly asked him if Mr. Snowden had given all the documents
he had taken from the NSA to journalists in Hong Kong, Mr. Kucherena said Mr.
Snowden had only given “some” of the NSA’s documents in his possession to journalists
in Hong Kong. “So he [Mr. Snowden] does have some materials that haven’t been made
public yet?” Ms. Shevardnadze asked. “Certainly,” Mr. Kucherena answered.

This disclosure filled in a crucial piece of the puzzle. It explained why NSA documents
that Mr. Snowden had copied, but had not given to the journalists in Hong Kong—such
as the embarrassing revelation about the NSA targeting the cellphone of German
Chancellor Angela Merkel—continued to surface after Mr. Snowden arrived in Moscow,
along with NSA documents released via WikiLeaks.

As this was a critical discrepancy in Mr. Snowden’s narrative, I went to Moscow in
October 2015 to see Mr. Kucherena. During our conversation, Mr. Kucherena confirmed
that his interview with Ms. Shevardnadze was accurate, and that Mr. Snowden had
brought secret material with him to Moscow.

Mr. Snowden’s narrative also includes the assertion that he was neither debriefed by nor
even met with any Russian government official after he arrived in Moscow. This part of
the narrative runs counter to findings of U.S. intelligence. According to the House
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence report, Mr. Snowden, since he arrived in
Moscow, “has had, and continues to have, contact with Russian intelligence services.”
This finding is consistent with Russian debriefing practices, as described by the ex-KGB
officers with whom I spoke in Moscow

Mr. Snowden also publicly claimed in Moscow in December 2013 to have secrets in his
head, including “access to every target, every active operation. Full lists of them.” Could
Mr. Snowden’s Russian hosts ignore such an opportunity after Mr. Putin had authorized
his exfiltration to Moscow? Mr. Snowden, with no exit options, was in the palm of their
hands. Under such circumstances, as Mr. Klintsevich pointed out in his June NPR
interview: “If there’s a possibility to get information, they [the Russian intelligence
services| will get it.”

The transfer of state secrets from Mr. Snowden to Russia did not occur in a vacuum. The
intelligence war did not end with the termination of the Cold War; it shifted to
cyberspace. Even if Russia could not match the NSA’s state-of-the-art sensors, computers
and productive partnerships with the cipher services of Britain, Israel, Germany and other
allies, it could nullify the U.S. agency’s edge by obtaining its sources and methods from
even a single contractor with access to Level 3 documents.

Russian intelligence uses a single umbrella term to cover anyone who delivers it secret
intelligence. Whether a person acted out of idealistic motives, sold information for money
or remained clueless of the role he or she played in the transfer of secrets—the provider
of secret data is considered an “espionage source.” By any measure, it is a job description
that fits Mr. Snowden.

Mr. Epstein’s book, “How America Lost Its Secrets: Edward Snowden, the Man and the
Theft,” will be published by Knopf in January.

It’s different from the software architecture, though of course certain cognitive architectures
and certain software architectures fit more naturally together.

e Cognitive Cycle: The basic “loop” of operations that an OpenCog system, used to control
an agent interacting with a world, goes through rapidly each subjective moment.” Typically
a cognitive cycle should be completed in a second or less. It minimally involves perceiving
data from the world, storing data in memory, and deciding what if any new actions need
to be taken based on the data perceived. It may also involve other processes like deliber-
ative thinking or metacognition. Not all OpenCog processing needs to take place within a
cognitive cycle.

e Cognitive Schematic: An implication of the form Context AND Procedure IMPLIES
goal”. Learning and utilization of these is key to CogPrime’s cognitive process.

e Cognitive Synergy: The phenomenon by which different cognitive processes, controlling a
single agent, work together in such a way as to help each other be more intelligent. Typically,
if one has cognitive processes that are individually susceptible to combinatorial explosions,
cognitive synergy involves coupling them together in such a way that they can help one
another overcome each other’s internal combinatorial explosions. The CogPrime design is
reliant on the hypothesis that its key learning algorithms will display dramatic cognitive
synergy when utilized for agent control in appropriate environments.

e CogPrime : The name for the AGI design presented in this book, which is designed specifi-
cally for implementation within the OpenCog software framework (and this implementation
is OpenCogPrime).

e CogServer: A piece of software, within OpenCog, that wraps up an Atomspace and a
number of MindAgents, along with other mechanisms like a Scheduler for controlling the
activity of the MindAgents, and code for important and exporting data from the Atomspace.

e Cognitive Equation: The principle, identified in Ben Goertzel’s 1994 book Chaotic
Logic, that minds are collections of pattern-recognition elements, that work by iteratively
recognizing patterns in each other and then embodying these patterns as new system ele-
ments. This is seen as distinguishing mind from self-organization” in general, as the latter
is not so focused on continual pattern recognition. Colloquially this means that a mind is
a system continually creating itself via recognizing patterns in itself.”

e Combo: The programming language used internally by MOSES to represent the programs
it evolves. SchemaNodes may refer to Combo programs, whether the latter are learned via
MOSES or via some other means. The textual realization of Combo resembles LISP with
less syntactic sugar. Internally a Combo program is represented as a program tree.

e Composer: In the PLN design, a rule is denoted a composer if it needs premises for
generating its consequent. See generator.

e CogBuntu: an Ubuntu Linux remix that contains all required packages and tools to test
and develop OpenCog.

e Concept Creation: A general term for cognitive processes that create new ConceptNodes,
PredicateNodes or concept maps representing new concepts.

e Conceptual Blending: A process of creating new concepts via judiciously combining
pieces of old concepts. This may occur in OpenCog in many ways, among them the explicit
use of a ConceptBlending MindAgent, that blends two or more ConceptNodes into a new
one.

e Confidence: A component of an OpenCog/PLN TruthValue, which is a scaling into the
interval [0,1] of the weight of evidence associated with a truth value. In the simplest case
(of a probabilistic Simple Truth Value), one uses confidence c = n / (n+k), where n is

want to become teachers but the faculty are focusing on their
graduate students. They don’t teach the teachers. They do it, but
it is not their focus.

The average professor of education here understands that he
is supposed to teach teachers to teach but he gets evaluated on
his research not on the quality of teachers who come out. It is
a research university. How many dollars do you bring in? How
much do you publish? Where would quality of teacher training
fit in that model?

So, again, what exactly is effective teaching? Let’s look at two of the lon-
ger versions of what my former Ph.D. students and former employees
wrote to me when I asked about good teaching. These stories each need
some context in order to be understood, and then I will comment.

The first story is from a Ph.D, student of mine who then continued
to work with me for 30 more years.

You were collecting key things teachers needed to know to do
story curricula properly. Your contribution was “know when to
lie to students.” That triggered all kinds of discussion, pro and
con, leading eventually to a longer, more explicit statement
about knowing when to oversimplify, etc.

Reflecting on it later, I realized that “know when to lie to
students” was the right way to say it. The rephrased version was
too reasonable. It didn’t trigger any emotional reaction and re-
evaluation. “Know when to lie” is a lie, but that’s the point.

Why is this story important? I placed it here because it reflects an
important belief that I hold about teaching. At the moment to which
he is referring, we were writing, as a group, a set of guidelines on how
to teach Socratically using the online curricula we were building for
high schools. We were, in essence, writing an instruction manual for
teachers on how to teach in a new way. When I supervise very smart
people who know perfectly well how to do things, I deliberately pro-
voke them. I believe that my job is to make them think. There is no
better way to make people think than by annoying them in a way that
makes them defend their point of view, especially when their point of
view may not have been well thought out.

the country in 1994. Since entering government, Yang “has been a central figure
promoting and helping to shape the New Zealand National government’s China
strategy” and was a member of the Parliamentary Select Committee for Foreign Affairs,
Defense, and Trade from 2014 to 2016, which would have given him privileged access
to information.*

Chinese influence efforts targeted toward New Zealand politics transcend the diaspora
community to include campaign contributions and the cultivation of relationships with
former senior officials. Individuals with strong ties to United Front organizations have
donated several million dollars, primarily to the National Party. One such individual, who
donated $112,000 to the National Party in 2017, is listed as an officer of no fewer than
seven United Front organizations.® Senior politicians who have secured high-profile roles
in Chinese companies include a former party leader and members of Parliament who
serve on the boards of the New Zealand affiliates of major Chinese banks. A former
minister of finance serves on the board of a majority-Chinese-owned New Zealand
dairy. In late September, a former prime minister who now represents an American
company’s interests in China attracted attention for the sale of property “well above
market rates” to an undisclosed Chinese buyer. Local politicians have also been
targeted.

Business

Chinese companies have also been instruments of interference in New Zealand. After
acquiring a stake in a local telecom company in 2011, Chinese telecom giant Huawei
went on to win the contract to build New Zealand’s 4G wireless network in 2013.
Huawei also established research partnerships and other investments in the country
that may be leveraged for nonbusiness purposes. In another instance, New Zealand
aeronautics company Pacific Aerospace in 2014 partnered with Beijing Automotive
Group on the sale of planes to the Chinese market. In 2017, Pacific Aerospace was
charged by New Zealand Customs with knowingly and illegally exporting parts to
North Korea via its Chinese partner.

Universities

New Zealand has long-standing scientific cooperation agreements with China, most
of which are benign. However, since China renewed an emphasis on civil-military
research integration in 2015, New Zealand, like other countries hosting major
research institutions, has been targeted for its potential to further these aims. New
Zealand universities have partnerships with several Chinese universities linked to
China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA), including the PLA Institute of Military
Culture (Massey); the National University of Defense Technology (Auckland, Massey);
Northwestern Polytechnical University (Canterbury), Shenyang Aerospace University

Washington must reassure Khamenei that the United States merely seeks a change in

Iranian behavior, not a change of the Iranian regime.

What they fail to consider is Khamenei's deep-seated conviction that U.S. designs to
overthrow the Islamic Republic hinge not on military invasion but on cultural and political
subversion intended to foment a velvet revolution from within. Consider this revealing

address on Iranian state TV in 2005:

More than Iran's enemies need artillery, guns, and so forth, they need to spread cultural
values that lead to moral corruption.... I recently read in the news that a senior official in
an important American political center said: Instead of bombs, send them miniskirts.” He
is right. If they arouse sexual desires in any given country, if they spread unrestrained
mixing of men and women, and if they lead youth to behavior to which they are naturally
inclined by instincts, there will no longer be any need for artillery and guns against that

nation.

Khamenei's vast collection of writings and speeches makes clear that the weapons of mass
destruction he fears most are cultural -- more Kim Kardashian and Lady Gaga than bunker
busters and aircraft carriers. In other words, Tehran is threatened not only by what
America does, but by what America is: a depraved, postmodern colonial power bent on
achieving global cultural hegemony. America's strategic policy,” Khamenei has said, is

seeking female promiscuity.”

Khamenei's words capture the paradox and perversion of modern Iran. While dropping
bombs on the Iranian regime could likely prolong its shelf-life, a regime that sees women's

hair as an existential threat is already well past its sell-by date.

MOTION BY MS. GREENBERG TO POSTPONE THE FINE
REDUCTION HEARING UNTIL AUGUST 21, 2008

SECONDED BY MS. VAN BUREN

MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY

IX. Comments:

Ms. Greenberg said that the presentation using the “slides” made it too dark in the room.
She wanted to know if there was anything they could do as a Board in making a
suggestion to the Council about an ordinance that could address people not pulling
permits because of the safety issues in terms of multi-family dwellings. Capt. Blouin said
there was a provision in place. If work is done without a permit, there is a penalty
involved. There was an ordinance drafted last year that requires them to pay four times
the permit fee.

Mr. Fried asked Mr. Randolph if he had spoken to Mr. Elwell about the foreclosure action
being brought to the Board’s area of responsibility as opposed to the Town Council. Mr.
Randolph said he had but did not have an answer yet and would try to get one. Mr. Fried
asked Ms. Houston about progress on the fines and she said the Town was now inputting
fines into the computer system and if someone had outstanding fines they could not get
any permits. People are contacting Code Enforcement because they cannot get permits
and are either paying or asking to come back to the Board for a fine reduction.

Capt. Blouin advised that with regard to any foreclosure action, the police department is
scrutinizing each and every one of them as some of these cases we have liens on were pre-
existing prior to coming to the police department. We do not want to bring a case to the
board that can be handled in a different manner.

Mr. Walton remarked that it was a good thing that there are a number of working without
permit cases being brought to the Board, that it means Staff is doing their job.

deliberation and the gaining of knowledge that will enhance our abil-
ity to reason. But suppose this conception we have of ourselves and
our ability to reason logically is simply wrong?

Our entire education system depends on this debate. Actually the
word debate is really not right here as there is no debate. The other
side, the side that says we need to teach our unconscious because our
conscious isn’t capable of listening, has not really been expressed di-
rectly very often. It is, however, indirectly referred to often enough.

Plato comments:

The most important part of education is right training in the
nursery. The soul of the child in his play should be guided to
the love of that sort of excellence in which when he grows up to
manhood he will have to be perfected.

Why should this be the case? Why should it be in the nursery where
real training takes place? And, what kind of training could the nurs-
ery provide—the kind of the football coach or the kind of the history
teacher? And, what can we learn about education by considering seri-
ously what Plato said?

The principles of learning in childhood are rather simple really.
The first and most important part of an analysis of early childhood
learning is an understanding of where the motivation comes from.
If learning starts with a goal, as we have said, one question is, What
goals do children have and how do they happen to have them?

When people mention motivation, the word reward often is added
into the discussion. What kinds of rewards do children receive and to
what extent are these involved in learning? Bear in mind that there
are three kinds of rewards: intrinsic, extrinsic, and systemic. If it makes
me happy, I don’t need you to tell me I did well. If the activity doesn’t
really matter to me (an algebra test, for example), I will need some
outside reward to even try. When do kids learn because of the use of
external rewards? If I do well on an algebra test, it might be that it
gives me intrinsic happiness to know I did well at algebra. As a math-
oriented kid, I did get that kind of reward. It also makes you happy
when your parents are proud of you. And it makes you happy when
your grades win you admission into Yale or get you something else
you might want. Which types of rewards figure into early childhood
learning and what can we learn from this about learning? And, what
will this tell us about teaching?

2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *922

CVRA contemplates that the attorney for the government will consider the victim's mterests in exercising prosecutorial
discretion, including the discretionary determination whether to consent to a Rule 20 transfer. The Subcommittee was not
persuaded that the rule should disturb this statutory balance by requiring the attorney for the government to advise the court of
a victim's objection to a Rule 20 transfer. In appropriate cases, the attorney for the government should appraise the court of the
victim's view. 76°

The Advisory Committee is able to claim that the CVRA does not specifically address transfer only because it reviewed an
amputated CVRA - that is, a CVRA without a right to fairness. Under an unblinkered fair reading of the CVRA, the right to
fairness applies specifically to Rule 20 transfer decisions, no less than the Rule 18 decision to set the place of prosecution just
discussed and, indeed, all other decisions in the criminal justice process. Thus, the Advisory Committee has unfairly stacked
the deck in deciding that it would not disturb this statutory balance, when it chose not to weigh the victim's right to fairness
as part of that balance.

Even under its truncated view of the statute, the Advisory Committee does envision that the prosecutors will confer with
victims about Rule 20 transfer decisions. But the Committee did not want to require prosecutors to notify courts of a victim's
objection, venturing only that in appropriate cases, the attorney for the government should appraise the court of the victim's
views. 3°! The Committee is coy on the question of when it would not be appropriate for the prosecutor to fail to notify a
court of the victim's views. Whenever an unrepresented crime victim objects to transferring a case, prosecutors, as officers of
the court, have a duty to pass that objection along to the court as relevant [*923] information bearing on the transfer decision.
362 The rule should state that fact directly.

Finally, nothing in my proposal would impair prosecutorial discretion. My proposal deals solely with ensuring that victim
information is passed along to the judge who must approve a transfer decision. The government remains entirely free to make
whatever decision it wants on the issue and argue whatever position it believes is appropriate. Moreover, the CVRA itself
envisions that the government may have obligations to assert victims’ rights. For starters, the CVRA requires prosecutors to
make their best efforts to see that victims are accorded their rights. 3°? In addition, the CVRA gives prosecutors the ability
to assert victims’ rights. 7+ This provision was designed to ensure that victims' rights are not inadvertently lost because a
victim lacks legal counsel. As Senator Kyl explained, This provision also recognizes that, at times, the government's attorney
may be best situated to assert a crime victim's rights ... because the crime victim is not available at a particular point in the trial

. . 36 Tp light of its obligations to accord victims their rights and to enforce those rights, the government should at least
inform the court when a victim has concems about a transfer.

Rule 21 - Victims’ Views Considered Regarding Transfer for Prejudice The Proposals:

I proposed that Rule 21 be amended to require consideration of the victim's interest in whether a case should be transferred as
follows:

(ec) Victims! Views. The court shall not transfer any proceeding without giving any victim an opportunity to be heard. The court

JAPAN

Japan would seem to be the perfect target for the Chinese party-state and its under-the-
radar efforts to turn potential adversaries into benign friends. Japan has deep cultural
and emotional ties with China, through history, language, and art, and a sense of Asian
fraternity forged by their struggles to keep intrusive, overbearing Western powers at
bay. Many in Japan also carry an enduring sense of remorse for their country’s brutal
subjugation of China in the opening half of the twentieth century. However, the

kinds of covert Chinese influence operations that have come to light in countries like
the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Europe—with one
exception—are not easy to find in Japan.

A natural place to look for evidence of influence-peddling would be in Chinese
support for the left-wing Japanese peace groups that have long investigated and
published evidence of the Imperial Army’s war atrocities in the 1930s and 1940s.
Such Japanese research has been politically useful for China in buttressing its own
efforts to chronicle the sufferings of its people during the conflict, as well as lending
support to Beijing’s tussling with Tokyo over how the history of the war should be
managed and told.

“Are you saying that the intelligence community has allowed you

“Exactly .. .”

On my return fight the next morning, | found myself reminiscing
about the 1987-88 TV season, when | had been a writer and on-air
commentator on 7he Wilton North Report, a nightly satirical hour on the
Fox network that lasted only 21 shows. Critics blamed the hosts, a pair of
disc jockeys who were not untalented but who were deliberately chosen
for their inoffensiveness.

show who also did the audience warm-ups. “No,” said the producer,

“he’ s not professional enough.” Ellen DeGeneres? “Too dykey.” Chris
rock? “Too raw.” Rosie O' Donnell? “Who wants to look at her every
night?” Richard Belzer? “Too reptilian.” Belzer is a conspiracy researcher
as well as a comedian and actor, but little did he ever dream that
ultimately he—his reptilian self—could be the culmination of his own

investigation.

noted that the street lights in Palm Beach do not go off during turtle nesting
season. He said a field permit for trimming of the sea grapes at the Nightingale
Beach Club Association was not recommended during the nesting season. He said
the indifference to materials he had brought forth more than a year ago that had
now been brought forth officially by the DEP were offensive to him and that is one
of the reasons he had continued to “hammer” this. He said he believed the Board
should recommend to the Town Council that they remove this section of the Code,
given the current environmental regime, especially when one considers the public
relations downside of fighting him on this issue and spending $2,000,000 to fight
Lake Worth on the other side. Mr. Maxey said this was probably not a win-win
situation and that NOAA had not even been brought into the fold yet.

Mr. Ochstein wanted to know if the Board was precluded from enforcing the
ordinance now. Mr. Walton said it should not be enforced now, that in speaking
with Mr. Wettstein from DEP and Ms. Higgins from FWC, an agreement had been
reached to wait until the end of turtle season to require the trimming. The Town
recommends granting the Nightingale Beach Club until November 7, 2008 to come
into compliance. The permit is good until that date. In response to Mr. Hoffman’s
question, Mr. Walton said the permit was issued on June 16, 2008. Mr. Maxey
said he applied on March 19, 2008. Mr. Balletine inquired as to whether 7 days
was sufficient for compliance after the end of turtle season and Mr. Walton said it
was not a large area and he believed it was. Mr. Maxey said he did not believe it
was sufficient, that it would be an economic hardship if he had to replace every
tree that is over 3 inches in diameter in order to get it below 6 feet and he brought
up other issues involved with the trimming. Mr. Balletine told Mr. Maxey he just
wanted to know, without going into a lot of detail, whether he could comply in a 7
day period.. Mr. Maxey said that before he could remove any native plant, he had
to first remove every single non-native one from the property and he had some
questions whether or not he could comply within that time period. He also said he
had some real questions about whether the law, both at the State and the local
level, had been equally applied within the Town. Mr. Maxey said he is in
consultation with an attorney to find out what measures he can take. The Town
did not apply for a permit to cut its own sea grapes and judging from the
guidelines he has in his permit, the Town would be in violation of almost everyone
of those guidelines. The DEP counsel’s office asked him to provide photographs
of the Town’s illegal cutting back in February.

Mr. Vanneck said there should be more research as to what should and should not
be cut. He believes the Town code may have gone too far.

Mr. Hoffman said the Board did not have the authority to modify the Code and
could only enforce the Codes as they had been written.

NOVEMBER 7, 2008 TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE AND IF
COMPLIANCE IS NOT ACHIEVED BY THAT DATE, TO ASSESS A FINE

the Palestinians after a transitional period. The part we had earmarked for
Palestinian control was now a bit over 85 percent of the West Bank, more than I’d
indicated to the President in our first meeting a year earlier. But while Abu Ala’a
had told Clinton he would ask for Arafat’s permission at least to negotiate, he
clearly hadn’t received it. He refused to talk about the map, or even respond to
Clinton’s suggestion that the Palestinians present a map of their own, until we did
two things: accept the principle of land swaps and reduce the size of the territory
we were suggesting for the settlement blocs. To Shlomo’s, and I’m sure even more
so to Abu Ala’a’s, astonishment, the President exploded. He told Abu Ala’a that to
refuse to provide any input or ideas was the very opposite of negotiation. It was an
“outrageous” approach. He stormed out.

It was late that evening when the first move toward the “make-or-break”
situation I had hoped for seemed to occur, though still with much more likelihood
of break than make. The President decided the only way to make progress was to
sequester a pair of negotiators from each side overnight. Their task would be to
search honesty for the outlines of a possible peace agreement. They were to update
Arafat and myself and then report to Clinton the next day. Then, we’d see where
we were. I agreed to send Shlomo and Gili Sher, my former “back-channel”
negotiators. I knew that whatever guidelines I gave them, they would probe beyond
them, just as they’d done in the back-channel talks. They were negotiators. They
were also smart, creative, badly wanted an agreement and, like me, believed it
ought to be possible. Though I would retain the final word to approve or reject
what they suggested, I knew that only in a legal sense could it be null and void. I
also recognized, however, that we had to be willing to push further, both to find
out for certain where the Palestinians stood and to convince the Americans we
genuinely wanted an agreement.

Shlomo and Gili left a little after midnight for Laurel Lodge. Marine guards
were posted at the doors, with orders that neither negotiating team was to leave
until morning without notifying the President’s staff. Mother Nature provided a
further incentive to stay inside, since it was again bucketing down with rain. The
negotiators talked not just through the night, but the next morning as well. It
wasn’t until early afternoon that Shlomo and Gili came to my cabin to report on
how they’d gone. As I'd anticipated, both of them had ventured beyond
concessions that I was ready to consider, at least at a ttme when we weren’t even
near to a final peace deal. Taking the President’s instructions to heart, they’d said

of distributions. In general, the term may be used to refer to any truth value involving
intervals or related constructs, such as indefinite probabilities.

e Indefinite Probability: An extension of a standard imprecise probability, comprising a
credible interval for the means of probability distributions governed by a given second-order
distribution.

e Indefinite Truth Value: An OpenCog TruthValue object wrapping up an indefinite prob-
ability

e Induction: In PLN, a specific inference rule (A > B, A > C, therefore B > C). In general,
the process of heuristically inferring that what has been seen in multiple examples, will be
seen again in new examples. Induction in the broad sense, may be carried out in OpenCog
by methods other than PLN induction. When emphasis needs to be laid on the particular
PLN inference rule, the phrase PLN Induction” is used.

e Inference: Generally speaking, the process of deriving conclusions from assumptions. In
an OpenCog context, this often refers to the PLN inference system. Inference in the broad
sense is distinguished from general learning via some specific characteristics, such as the
intrinsically incremental nature of inference: it proceeds step by step.

e Inference Control: A cognitive process that determines what logical inference rule (e.g.
what PLN rule) is applied to what data, at each point in the dynamic operation of an
inference process.

e Integrative AGI: An AGI architecture, like CogPrime, that relies on a number of different
powerful, reasonably general algorithms all cooperating together. This is different from an
AGI architecture that is centered on a single algorithm, and also different than an AGI
architecture that expects intelligent behavior to emerge from the collective interoperation
of a number of simple elements (without any sophisticated algorithms coordinating their

back in time, albeit as a simulation, and relive past events. This would
have no effect on the events themselves as it would be like watching a
movie, but we could see every aspect of the past from any viewpoint.

To perform this time travel trick for real, we would have to gather
information from an enormously wide area. Information spreads
out at the speed of light. One minute after the dominoes topple, the
information about the event will have spread one light minute — that
is over a sphere forty-million kilometers across — half way to Venus.
An hour later and it would be outside the solar system. If you were to
cast your net that wide, and gathered up all the information within the
sphere, you could still perfectly model the moment when the dominoes
were toppled. The wider you cast the net, the more information you have
and the further backward in time you can travel. If you take the idea of
collecting information to its logical conclusion you could gather all the
information in the Universe at a moment in time.

In 1814, Laplace put this idea in an essay. He proposed an immensely
powerful being observes the position and momentum of every particle
in the Universe. Armed with any snapshot of the Universe and the laws
of physics, the entire future and the past of the Universe. The being was
nicknamed Laplace’s Daemon and the idea has influenced philosophy
ever since.

If the Universe is predictable, our concept of time needs to be
rethought. A common sense notion isthat things inthe futureare unknown
and things in the past are known. But, in a deterministic Universe a
daemon or a supercomputer could keep track of all the information and
tell you what is inevitably going to happen. The conscious feeling we have
of moving through time would be just an illusion. Past and future have
no meaning and there would just be a solid, permanent block of space-
time. If you stood outside the Universe and looked at this block of space-
time, everything that is going to happen and has already happened is set.
This is sometimes called the Block Universe Hypothesis and is the logical
conclusion of any theory that imagines an entirely determined Universe.

One thing that seems to throw doubt on this Block Universe
Hypothesis is our personal conscious experience of the world. We
experience the Universe unfolding over time. (Of course, we could have
this conscious experience in a determined Universe if someone had
programmed it that way. All we can say is that it seems unlikely someone
would go to the trouble of giving us a completely fictitious experience.
There are an infinite number of possible Universes, why pick one where
we think time flows, but it does not.)

RE: Proposed Letter to Speciat Master

ORES 1 = =

Good morning, Jay. We need to resolve the attorney issue today. It has been
weeks since execution of the contract, and there is no need for further delay.

As far as the five attorney names that we will be providing, I propose Bert
Ocariz, Katherine Ezell at Podhurst Orseck, Stuart Grossman, Ed Rogers, and
Walter Cobath.

If you would like to use the same Special Master to resolve fees disputes as
well as to handie the selection of the attorney, I would recommend that we use
retired llth Circuit Judge Joseph Hatchett instead of Judge Davis because of
Judge Davis's heaith problems. (No one has contacted Judge Hatchett yet, but
one of the District Judges in Miami mentioned him as a good choice.)

I am available for a conference call between 9:00 and 10:00, and between 3:15
and 6:00. Please call me on my cell and let me know which of
those times works best for you.

Thank you.

tactics that run the gamut from creating rapport, to encouraging trust, to building sexual
tension, to shifting social power. But although the purpose of these social tactics is to
manipulate emotion, the tactics are typically described as concretely as possible. Some
PUA coaches provide long memorized routines, but it is more common to talk about
particular social actions or broader strategies.

One famous PUA tactic is called the neg. Neg stands for negative hit, and one site
defines a neg as a remark, sometimes humorous, used to point out a woman's flaws.
Like many PUA terms, the deeper meanings and usage vary from PUA to PUA -- but
there is an especially dramatic range of meanings with neg.

Some PUAs see negs as friendly teasing: a way for the PUA to show that he is paying
attention to the girl, without appearing needy or overeager. I can offer a cute example of
this approach from my own life. I was sitting in a cafe with a former PUA, and he gazed
deep into my eyes.

Wait a minute,” he said slowly. Are your glasses held together by epoxy? It looks like
you had to repair them at the comers.

Yeah, I admitted.
He grinned. Everything about you just screams ‘starving artist,’ doesn't it.”

This made me laugh for quite a while. I think it worked because he understood that I have
chosen (for now) to be a broke writer -- but he also recognized the tension I feel about
that choice. So this gentleman was demonstrating that he correctly discerned my
priorities; that he is not bothered by a choice that makes me feel self-conscious; and that
he is confident enough to tease me.

Also, at a moment when I thought he might compliment my eyes, the former PUA shook
up my expectations by breaking the romantic pattern. Often, effective flirting involves
offering the right mixture of confidence plus charming novelty plus paying attention.

PL

Some PUAs see negs more strategically, as a way of passing a woman's tests or
breaching her indifference. They argue that this is necessary for women who are very
high-status, very beautiful, etc. They argue that some women develop a kind of immunity
to compliments, and that some women actively prefer feisty, faux-adversarial flirting.
Most PUAs only advocate using negs on women who meet a certain minimum level of
attractiveness, or who seem particularly feisty. Neil Strauss, a famous PUA and author of
the bestseller The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists, once wrote
that:

When you give a woman who's often hit on a generic compliment, she will usually either
ignore the remark or assume you're saying it because you want to sleep with her.

When you tease her and show her that you're unaffected by her beauty and demonstrate
that you're out of her league -- and THEN let her work to win you over and ultimately
REWARD her with your approval, she will leave that night feeling good about herself.
Like something special happened and she connected with somebody who appreciates her
for who she REALLY is.

is new, suspect and run on a cash-and-carry basis. We are made to feel like there

devotion to her “children,” felt like an empty husk, encased in the exoskeletal armor

In new and potentially therapeutic settings, for example a genuinely loving

first generated their detachment. They provoke the very mistrust they fear. The
sexually exploited child is seductive. The physically abused child provokes attack.
Personality constellations which can be adaptive, when narrowed and fixated,

personality disorders are self-maintaining.

An irony is that these interpersonally empty and rigid patterns in personality

severe neuropsychological impairment, chronic depression, severe social
withdrawal or the pediatric psychotic disorders. The children with sufficient flexibility
to adapt quickly and survive often settle into empty-centered rigid caricatures of
adult personality styles.

Of course, well-defined and characteristic personality patterns do not require
abandonment and abuse or the pathological simplification of traumatic deforestation
of neuronal connectivities in order to emerge. Demanding social selection of
particular personality proclivities that are competitively advantageous for highly

The Food and Drug Administration has approved Praluent, a new medicine to lower cholesterol in people who 
have established heart disease, for people whose risk of a heart attack or stroke is not being adequately 
controlled by existing drugs called statins. 
It might be a big step in the battle against heart disease — and the approval is a triumph for Regeneron 
Pharmaceuticals, the Tarrytown, N.Y.-based biotechnology company that invented it. Praluent is likely to be 
more widely used, and to cost more, than Wall Steet analysts expected. That also means it could be a big cost 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026362 
down the line. 
Obviously, the class is one of the biggest developments in cardiology in the last decade, that will allow us to 
treat patients who have been extremely difficult to treat with high levels of LDL cholesterol, says Steven 
Nissen, chairman of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic. It's very promising. 
But it will also be very expensive, say Troy Brennan, the chief medical officer of CVS Caremark, the giant 
pharmacy benefits manager.If these drugs are used as broadly as they could be used, they are going to be by 
far the most expensive drug class, Brennan says. 
Praluent, an injection, lowers low-density lipoprotein, the so-called bad cholesterol, by as much as 60%, far 
more than the statin drugs alone. It is the first drug to work by targeting a protein called PCSK9. Mutations in 
the gene that makes it can result in patients having lower cholesterol and a dramatically lower lifetime risk of 
heart attacks. A rival medicine from Amgen is also expected to be approved soon. The FDA is 
clearing Praluent for patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic condition that causes 
high cholesterol, and for people who have heart disease, like those who've had heart attacks or strokes, who 
are already taking the maximum dose of a statin they can tolerate. 
Regeneron and its marketing partner Sanofi say Praluent will have a wholesale cost of $40 a day, or $14,600 a 
year, for either of two doses, 75 milligrams or 150 mgs. It's likely that insurance companies will get a 
significant discount, because Amgen and Regeneron will compete by giving the insurers rebates.

We don't want the noise about these drugs to be price, says Leonard Schleifer, the chief executive and 
founder of Regeneron. We have to make sure that people get access to the drug for a fair price if they're 
insured, for free if they're not insured, or at a discount if they're under-insured. 
Praluent's price is 46% higher than that forecast by Evercore ISI, an investment bank, and it is being approved 
for a larger group of patients than many Wall Street analysts expected following a meeting convened by the 
FDA to analyze the data on the drug. Some doctors argued its use should be restricted mainly to patients with 
FH. But Mark Schoenebaum, Evercore ISI's pharmaceutical analyst, says that investors were initially 
disappointed because they had hoped the FDA would greenlight the drug for an even broader group. 
Regeneron shares were down 2.5% in afternoon trading before they were halted pending news. 
But doctors may prescribe the drug more widely than the label suggests. A survey of physicians published this 
morning by Geoffrey Porges, an biotechnology analyst at investment bank Sanford C. Bernstein, found that 
they would use the drug in 30% to 40% of patients who had already had heart attacks. He wrote that 2020 
sales of Praluent could be as high as $4.8 billion. 
In the survey, doctors expressed a preference for Praluent. One advantage of Regeneron's drug is that doctors 
will be able to start it at a lower, 75 milligram dose. 
Schleifer, who is a medical doctor and, incidentally, a billionaire thanks to his Regeneron stake, says that the 
company expects that as many as 8 million people who don't have their cholesterol well-controlled could be 
candidates for Praluent. He emphasized, though, that until larger studies prove the drug prevents heart attacks 
and strokes patients should always choose statins first. It will have sales representatives a 
Insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers, who help insurers and employers manage drug costs, are 
going to do their best to restrict use of Praluent, though. Brennan, the CVS Caremark executive, says that he 
expects patients will need to have medical records documenting that they have already taken statins. Those not 
taking statins would need a blood test confirming that a statin caused elevations in muscle or liver enzymes, 
not just complaints that they were achy. We're not trying to replace statins, says Schliefer, the Regeneron 
CEO. 
Most people who have muscle problems from statins do not have those elevated muscle enzymes, says Nissen, 
the Cleveland Clinic cardiologist, who is conducting a clinical trial Amgen and Pfizer, which is also 
developing a similar cholesterol drug. He says he has patients who are desperate to take a statin but who 
cannot tolerate it because of muscle pain but do not have elevated muscle enzymes. 
Dehspite significant progress over the last decades, high cholesterol remains a leading concern in the U.S. and 
globally, said Olivier Brandicourt, M.D., Chief Executive Officer, Sanofi. Praluent demonstrates the power 
of the Sanofi and Regeneron alliance to deliver a first-in-class therapy in the U.S. for patients in need. Sanofi 
has a strong cardiovascular heritage and dedication to these patients, and we look forward to working with 
other regulatory authorities to make Praluent available to patients worldwide. 
We are grateful to the thousands of patients and investigators worldwide who participated in the ODYSSEY 
clinical trial program, said Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., Founder, President, and Chief Executive 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026364 
Officer, Regeneron. Praluent represents the culmination of more than a decade of tireless work to translate the 
genetic-based discovery of PCSK9 into an innovative medicine that brings meaningful value to patients. 
The approval of Praluent was based on data from the pivotal Phase 3 ODYSSEY program, which showed 
consistent, positive results compared to placebo, which included current standard of care therapy (statins). In 
the ODYSSEY LONG TERM trial which evaluated Praluent 150 mg every two weeks, Praluent reduced LDL 
cholesterol by 58 percent versus placebo at week 24 when added to current standard of care, including 
maximally tolerated statins. In ODYSSEY COMBO I, Praluent 75 mg every two weeks as an adjunct to statins 
reduced LDL cholesterol by an additional 46 percent compared to placebo at week 12. At week 24 in the same 
trial, Praluent reduced LDL cholesterol by 43 percent compared to placebo. In this study, if additional LDL 
cholesterol lowering was required based on pre-specified criteria at week 8, Praluent was up-titrated to 150 mg 
at week 12 for the remainder of the trial. Eighty-three percent of patients remained on their initial 75 mg dose. 
Praluent is generally well-tolerated with an acceptable safety profile. Local injection site reactions including 
redness, itching, swelling or pain/tenderness where the injection is given were the most common events (7.2 
percent with Praluent versus 5.1 percent with placebo) and resulted in a low discontinuation rate that was 
comparable to placebo (0.2 percent with Praluent versus 0.4 percent with placebo). Patients receiving Praluent 
had a greater number of injection site reactions, had more reports of associated symptoms, and had reactions of 
longer average duration than patients receiving placebo. Other common adverse events occurring more 
frequently in patients with Praluent than placebo included symptoms of the common cold and flu or flu-like 
symptoms. 
The companies carefully considered the potential medical value that Praluent offers patients in determining the 
Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC). The U.S. WAC price of Praluent is $40 per day ($1,120 every 28 days) 
for both the 75 mg and 150 mg doses, making Praluent the lowest priced patient-administered monoclonal 
antibody therapy on an annualized basis. Actual costs to patients, payers and health systems are anticipated to 
be lower as WAC pricing does not reflect discounts or rebates. Out-of-pocket costs to patients will vary 
depending on insurance status and eligibility for patient assistance. 
Sanofi and Regeneron are committed to ensuring that patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Praluent are able 
to access the medicine and receive the support they may need. The companies will launch a comprehensive 
program that offers support, training and follow up for patients at every step of the process. The program will 
provide patient assistance to uninsured or underinsured patients, including providing free medicine to eligible 
patients, and can help identify coverage options for out-of-pocket costs. Additional services include

ODYSSEY Program 
The ODYSSEY Phase 3 program is one of the most comprehensive clinical trial programs ever conducted for 
an investigational LDL cholesterol lowering therapy. The program includes 14 global Phase 3 trials evaluating 
more than 23,500 patients. The primary efficacy end point in all of the studies was the mean percent reduction 
from baseline in LDL cholesterol at week 24 compared to placebo (maximally tolerated statin therapy); all of 
the completed studies met their primary endpoint. A significantly higher proportion of patients achieved LDL 
cholesterol of less than 70 mg/dL in the Praluent group as compared to placebo at both week 12 and week 24. 
The ongoing ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial will prospectively evaluate the cardiovascular benefits of Praluent 
in approximately 18,000 patients.

The same could be said of continued outflows
from gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs). We
estimate that a net 280 tonnes of gold ETF
holdings—an amount even larger than the 210
tonnes of ETF outflows that pressured gold prices
in late 2016—were purchased over the past year
at levels above today’s price. Absent a rebound
in gold prices, these ETF holders might prefer to
realize their losses and rotate into instruments with
a yield component. Value-minded investors should
also consider that gold prices remains well above
their long-term average (see Exhibit 100).

Despite this challenging outlook, a number
of factors could still buoy gold prices in the year
ahead. Emerging market central banks have
continued to buy gold to diversify their reserves.
Moreover, the stronger global growth we expect
could lift jewelry demand, particularly in gold’s
two largest end markets—China and India. Finally,
gold’s allure as an inflation hedge could come back
into focus if the market begins to worry about
economic overheating in the US, although this is
not our base case.

In light of these crosscurrents, we are tactically
neutral on gold at this time.

Jeffrey and Ghislaine: Notes on New York's Oddest Alliance <

ghislaine-maxwell.html > 
by Vicky Ward <http://www.vanityfair.com/contributors/vicky-  ward> 
March 8, 2011, 2:30 PM 
I've got a story idea for you. The rebuilding of Indonesia. Or New Orleans. Or both. Go there. I've just been. 
You will never think the same way about anything again. 
So spoke not Bill or Melinda Gates, but Ghislaine Maxwell, the 48-year-old woman being written up 
everywhere at the moment as the alleged procurer of young women for billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. 
Epstein, 57, is the financier who spent a year in jail on charges of soliciting prostitutes—and now there is talk of 
another investigation because various women, now in their twenties and thirties, have come forward with 
allegations that he molested them when they were under-age. The allegations first surfaced in British 
newspapers, which have zeroed in on Epstein's friendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tried to 
publicly disassociate himself from his old pal. 
I wrote a piece for Vanity Fair in 2003 called The Talented Mr. Epstein. It was largely a business piece that 
focused on his mysterious exit from Bear Stearns in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne, Les 
Wexner, the chairman of Limited Brands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude 
Hoffenberg, who is currently serving a 20-year-jail sentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of 
$450 million. 
The piece alluded to Epstein's great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women 
with whom he had sexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn't really go there, focusing instead on the 
issue that remains a mystery—how Jeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers. 
This is not to say I didn't hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I 
concentrated on the intriguing financial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same 
ones, different ones. And their stories are bone-chilling. Journalists from England have phoned—and, in one 
case, flown—to ask me about Epstein and Maxwell. Who is he? And the British, especially, want to know: 
Who is she? At this point, I am so bored of repeating myself to others—it was, after all, my 2003 Vanity 
Fairstory that really brought him into the limelight—that I have decided to write about this myself. 
Bizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to know Jeffrey and Ghislaine far better after my piece than before it. I kept 
running into both of them, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of 
young women with him who stand two feet behind him, as if serving a monarch. Do they speak? I remember 
asking him once, nodding at his lookalike blondes. He laughed. Not like you,Vicky, was his riposte. 
I remembered that when we'd once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I 
hadn't studied math since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a 
package at home via messenger. It was a book: Math for idiots. 
So he is not without humor, even though he doesn't drink or smoke, and hates restaurants. 
Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects, newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030528 
was certainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few 
moments in his company and you know this to be true. 
When I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that 
Andy—as Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his 
strange title is. Because if one thing's for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what 
he's talking about far more than Andy does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other 
financiers hang out with him. 
And Ghislaine? 
Full disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It's almost impossible not to. 
She is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I've spent hours 
talking to her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is 
curious. She has spent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent 
me a DVD of the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away almost anyone else's I can think of—probably even 
Rupert Murdochs'. She is very well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill 
Clinton with whom she is close friends. 
Yet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-
Platero, (known fondly to her close friends as the Tennis Goddess) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When 
it comes down to things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her 
vulnerability. 
And that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey. 
He saved her, I remember a close friend of mine telling me. When her father died, she was a wreck; 
inconsolable. And then Jeffrey took her in. She's never forgotten that—and never will. 
In many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect 
replacement for her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his 
sexual pecadillos, but then Ghislaine's father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving 
a massive black hole he'd fraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey's habits may not have seemed that 
strange. 
In fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful 
people in the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl issues, 
and moved countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You don't 
tend to get to the top by being the world's most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett didn't 
quite manage a normal life—whatever that is. He had a second wife for many years whose existence he has 
been open about. 
So what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven't spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her 
loyalty to friends like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about as always. 
Look at Waksal and Stewart. No one sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up 
for all sorts of blemishes.

normaly thier strategy will be to take back your defense to the accusers. and attack each one. if they find you 
are right they will leave out. and only go with the conflicted. I think you should include short concise cover 
letter. that you would like published in it entirety. it can refence your attacjment that you will put on your web 
site? . that goes into more details but in general , these are false. they were either investigated and found 
lacking or ignored. etc. often they throw out the near publishing date merely to get you to ansser.

Second Draft: 
I appreciate the opportunity to respond to your email. While I am running the risk that you will report my comments, if you do, either 
out of context, or incompletely, I am responding with an effort to be complete. It is hard to know how to respond to a list of false 
and/or distorted allegations, along with misleading statements on your part. I treat people I interact with with respect, and I work hard 
to support and mentor students, colleagues, and members of the general public. I do not sexually harass people. If the purpose of 
your reporting is to somehow argue that Universities and other institutions are lax in dealing with well known individuals like myself, 
then in fact the situation is quite the opposite. My high public profile opens me up to more scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it 
also opens me up to a host of outside complaints and allegations that other faculty do not receive, each of which the University has to 
respond to. The fact that I have remained a professor in all Universities with which I have been associated, in good standing, and also 
an officer or an invited speaker at organizations like CFI, which have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the fact that they 
trust my behavior. I was asked to be an honorary director of CFI, and invited to their last 3 meetings to speak, specifically because, as 
they have written me after the fact, the attendees universally appreciated my talks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time 
with the attendees. If the purpose of your report is to impugn my integrity or suggest I have a history of harassment, that too is 
false. As noted in one of your 'miscellaneous facts', as a scientist I try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather 
than allegations and innuendo. I also try and judge the facts in context. The fact that Universities and other organizations employ me 
or have me on their boards, or invite me to meetings is because they value my contributions and my actions. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021425 
The items you list are false or distorted. Item 1 refers falsely and inaccurately to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 
where we mutually decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, and there were respectful 
and platonic encounters afterwards. There is nothing to comment on in item 3, which involves an anonymous 3rd party claim 
because I know nothing about it, there are no details provided, and it clearly was not taken seriously enough to result in any university 
action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying that because I decided I didn't want to go out to a bar with a group of attendees that I was 
harassing them? The second part did not happen. Re incident 5: The 'female companion' in this case is my wife, who can attest to 
the fact that the claim is false, which is what I wrote at the time in response to the blog in question, causing it to be taken down. 
It is worth responding to Item 2 and 6 in more detail, 
Re item 2: the student in question was interested in science communication, and on dozens of occasions came to me or wrote to me 
with questions. When she asked about advice for after graduation I DID tell her she was different than the other students in her 
year. The rest of them were interested in going on to graduate school, but she was interested in science communication so I told her 
that she might want to take a different path. Since she was the only woman in her year, as I recall, I did ask her on one of these 
occasions if that made it difficult for her in any way. I asked, because as a faculty member I was interested in knowing what we could 
do, if necessary to encourage more women to go into physics, and also because as someone she had asked for career advice from I 
wanted to know if that made a difference to her. Re asking her for dinner.. I have gone back over emails from that period. I have 
numerous requests from her asking me to go for coffee to talk, which I usually had to turn down because I was busy, and on several 
occasions sh specifically asked me to have coffee with her off campus to talk, and I politely declined. I did let her accompany me off 
campus one time to watch me do a BBC interview because she specifically requested it. I did and do have coffee and meals with 
students on campus, and I see nothing wrong with this. I try to treat even students as respected colleagues if possible. I was shocked 
when I later learned of the complaint she was apparently asked to lodge to the University, not least because there was no 
inappropriate interaction and also because, well after the dates you listed on which she was apparently offended, she continued to 
email me with joking questions or comments. Also, at a later AAAS conference, again in 2008, for which she had asked, and for 
which I had written her a letter of recommendation to attend, my wife and I gave her a lift in our taxi well out out of our way in order to 
drop her off at her hotel, and I note in an email response to her email about the conference, agin in 2008, I expressed that I would 
pass her regards along to my wife and vice versa. When the University later informed me of the complaint I was shocked and 
concerned. When I spoke to the human resources person, including relating my concerns and providing the emails in question, I was 
told that no formal complaint of sexual harassment was deemed at that time to be called for, and that the young woman in question 
had agreed to that. By that time I learned of the complaint I had already announced my intentions to leave Case to accept an offer at 
ASU—a very difficult decision for me because of my long-standing attachment to the University, and the excellent relations I had with 
my colleagues there, both among the faculty and among the administration. Because I was already in Arizona at the time I was asked 
not to have any further interaction with the student I agreed to that request, both to respect her sensitivities and also because it was 
basically moot because I was not on campus. I was also told that because it was being handled informally, that (a) it should remain 
confidential, which I, at least abided by, and (b) if no further complaints were lodged in that case, that the University would remove the 
complaint from my record after 5 years, which makes me surprised that someone violated that written agreement with you. 
Re item 6: You report on ASU's response to item #6 , without including the fact that the University specifically stated there were never 
any allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment by me at the University, and morever the outside complaints were in fact related 
specifically to your item #6. Further you neglect to mention that this complaint was by an anonymous third party, not the individual 
who was allegedly harassed, who never lodged a complaint, and that no specific evidence was provided of the alleged 
transgression. I was surprised and dismayed that both ASU and ANU launched investigations on the basis of this but was told by both 
Universities that because of my high profile even such unsubstantiated third party complaints at private events unrelated to the 
University would be investigated. The complaint was investigated throughly by both ASU and ANU and both came to the conclusion 
that it was not credible and no university policies had been violated. . In addition ANU's investigation, which took a full month found 
significant inconsistencies in the allegation, suggesting distortion and fabrication, I will quote from the ANU report. The initial 
complaint, which in fact resulted in a temporary suspension of my position at ANU, until it was dismissed, outlined the claim you made 
in the words you quoted in your note to me, but it also stated 
It is the University's understanding that a complaint was lodged directly to the conference organisers at the time of the incident. 
After the month-long investigation, during which I was told I was not to interact with anyone on campus (again moot because I was a 
hemisphere removed) the final report absolved me of any wrongdoing, and indicated information inconsistent with the original claim 
and apparent later claims as follows in the report, from which I quote: 
The allegations were made by an observer to the incident. 
- The complaint did not identify, nor disclose the identity of the conference attendee who was allegedly touched in 
an unwelcome manner. 
- The conference attendee who took the selfie' photo did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference organisers 
at the time of the incident (November 2016). 
- The conference attendee who witnessed the incident, did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference organisers 
at the time of the incident (November 2016). 
The photo submitted as part of the complaint does not provide evidence of any physical contact. 
- The complainant alleged that a photo exists, showing your hand on the breast of the conference attendee who took 
the selfie' photo. This photo was not made available to the Australian National University, although it was requested 
in the course of the investigation. 
(And for the record I often put my hand up in front of a camera if there is a flash, as I specifically request selfies not to include flashes, 
so that I don't end up with a series bright spots in front of my eyes for the next half hour)

What makes this particular type of allegation so repugnant is that I get asked for literally thousands of selfies, and when people come 
up to me they are vulnerable, often shaking, and sometimes overly aggressive. I am particularly proud of the way I attempt to make all 
people feel at ease, and respected, rather than humiliated. Thus, this false claim strikes at the heart of what I am about, which is to 
acknowledge fans in a way that makes them feel appreciated. As I understand you had a reporter watching me sign books and take 
selfies at the CFI conference in Las Vegas this year, that behavior is what they will have witnessed. Moreover, I am proud of the 
interactions I have had at both Case and ASU, with students, colleagues and staff of all genders and ethnicities. I have worked hard 
to support them, mentor them, and treat them with respect. I treat others as responsible adults, and I expect to be treated equally.

First draft: 
It is hard to know how to respond to a list of false and/or distorted allegations, along with misleading statements on your part. 
Needless to say, I treat people I interact with with respect, and I work hard to support and mentor students, colleagues, and members 
of the general public. I do not sexually harass people. If the purpose of your reporting is to somehow argue that that Universities and 
other institutions are lax in dealing with well known individuals like myself, then in fact the situation is quite the opposite. My high 
public profile opens me up to more scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it also opens me up to a host of outside complaints and 
allegations that other faculty do not receive, each of which the University has to respond to. The fact that I have remained a professor 
in all Universities with which I have been associated, in good standing, and also an officer or an invited speaker at organizations like 
CFI, which have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the fact that they trust my behavior. I was asked to be an honorary 
director of CFI, and invited to their last 3 meetings to speak, specifically because, as they have written me after the fact, the attendees 
universally appreciated my talks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time with the attendees. If the purpose of your report is 
to impugn my integrity or suggest I have a history of harassment, that too is false. As noted in one of your 'miscellaneous facts', as a 
scientist I try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather than allegations and innuendo. I also try and judge the facts 
in context. The fact that Universities and other organizations employ me or have me on their boards, or invite me to meetings is 
because they value my contributions and my actions. 
Your specific allegations are false or distorted. Item 1 refers to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 where we mutually 
decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, and had respectful encounters afterwards. I 
cannot comment on item 3, which involves an anonymous 3rd party claim, because I know nothing about it, and it was not taken 
seriously enough to result in any university action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying that because I decided I didn't want to go out 
to a bar with a group of attendees that I was harassing them? The second part is false. I don't do that. Re incident 5: The 'female 
companion' in this case is my wife, who can attest to the fact that the claim is false, which is what I wrote in response to the blog in 
question, causing it to be taken down. 
It is worthwhile responding to Item 2 and 6 in more detail, 
Re item 2: the student in question was interested in science communication, and on dozens of occasions came to me or wrote to me 
with questions. When she asked about advice for after graduation I DID tell her she was different than the other students in her 
year. The rest of them were interested in going on to graduate school, but she was interested in science communication so I told her 
that she might want to take a different path. Since she was the only woman in her year, as I recall, I did ask her on one of these 
occasions if that made it difficult for her in any way. I asked, because as a faculty member I was interested, and also because as 
someone she had asked for career advice from I wanted to know if that made a difference to her. Re asking her for dinner.. I have 
gone back over emails from that period. I have numerous requests from her to go for coffee to talk, which I usually had to turn down 
because I was busy, including several occasions where she asked me to have coffee with her off campus to talk, and I politely 
declined. I did let her accompany me off campus one time to watch me do a BBC interview because she specifically requested it. I 
did and do have coffee and meals with students on campus, and I see nothing wrong with this. I was shocked when I later learned of 
her complaint, not least because there was no inappropriate interaction and also because well after the date on which she is said to 
have been offended, she continued to email me with joking questions or comments, and at a AAAS conference in 2008, for which she 
had asked, and for which I had written her a letter of recommendation to attend, my wife and I gave her a lift well out out of our way to 
drop her off at her hotel, and I note in an email response to her email about the conference, agin in 2008, I expressed that I would 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021427 
pass her regards along to my wife and vice versa. When the University informed me of the complaint I was shocked and 
concerned. When I spoke to the human resources person, including relating my concerns and providing the emails in question, I was 
told that no formal complaint of sexual harassment was deemed to be warranted in this case, and that the young woman in question 
had agreed to that. By that time I learned of the complaint I had already announced my intentions to leave Case to accept an offer at 
ASU—a very difficult decision for me because of my long-standing attachment to the University, and the excellent relations I had with 
my colleagues there, both among the faculty and among the administration. Because I was already in Arizona at the time I was asked 
not to have any further interaction with the student I agreed to that request because it was basically moot. I was also told that 
because it was being handled informally, that (a) it should remain confidential, which I, at least abided by, and (b) if no further 
complaints were lodged in that case, that the University would remove the allegation from my record after 5 years, which makes me 
surprised that someone violated that written agreement with you. 
Re item 6: You report on ASU's response to item #6 , without including the fact that the University specifically stated there were never 
any allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment by me at the University, and the outside complaints were in fact related 
specifically to your item #6. Further you neglect to mention that this complaint was by an anonymous third party, not the individual 
who was allegedly harassed, who never lodged a complain, and that no specific evidence was provided of the alleged transgression. I 
was surprised and dismayed that both ASU and ANU launched investigations on the basis of this but was told by both Universities that 
because of my high profile even such unsubstantiated third party complaints at private events unrelated to the University would be 
investigated. The complaint was investigated throughly by both ASU and ANU and both came to the conclusion that it was not 
credible and no university policies had been violated.. In addition ANU's investigation, which took a full month found significant 
inconsistencies in the allegation, suggesting distortion and fabrication, I will quote from the ANU report. The initial complaint, which in 
fact resulted in a temporary suspension by ANU outlined the claim you made in the words you quoted in your note to me, along with 
the statement made in the complaint that 
It is the University's understanding that a complaint was lodged directly to the conference organisers at the time of the incident. 
After the investigation, the final report absolved me of any wrongdoing, and indicated information inconsistent with the original claim 
and apparent later claims as follows: 
The allegations were made by an observer to the incident. 
- The complaint did not identify, nor disclose the identity of the conference attendee who was allegedly touched in 
an unwelcome manner. 
- The conference attendee who took the selfie' photo did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference organisers 
at the time of the incident (November 2016). 
- The conference attendee who witnessed the incident, did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference organisers 
at the time of the incident (November 2016). 
The photo submitted as part of the complaint does not provide evidence of any physical contact. 
- The complainant alleged that a photo exists, showing your hand on the breast of the conference attendee who took 
the selfie' photo. This photo was not made available to the Australian National University, although it was requested 
in the course of the investigation. 
(And for the record I often put my hand up in front of a camera if there is a flash, as I specifically request selfies not to include flashes, 
so that I don't end up with a series bright spots in front of my eyes for the next half hour) 
What makes this particular type of allegation so repugnant is that I get asked for literally thousands of selfies, and when people come

selfies at the CFI conference in Las Vegas this year, that behavior is what they will have witnessed. Moreover, I am proud of the 
interactions I have had at both Case and ASU, with students, colleagues and staff. I have had numerous female graduate students, 
postdocs, employees, and colleagues, and as ASU attested to you, none of these have ever complained of harassment. Quite the 
contrary in fact, as I have worked hard to support them, mentor them, and treat them with respect. I treat others as responsible adults, 
and I expect to be treated equally.

From: Peter Aldhous 
Subject: URGENT: BuzzFeed News inquiry re allegations of sexual harassment 
Date: December 10, 2017 at 5:12:27 PM PST 
To: 
Dr. Krauss: 
As you know, I'm a reporter for BuzzFeed News who has been investigating sexual misconduct allegations 
against you. As we've already discussed by email, I'd very much like to interview you about these allegations 
in detail. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021428 
In particular, you stated in an email sent on Nov 13 that two universities had investigated an incident (# 6 
below). You claimed that both Universities independently concluded that the report was unsubstantiated and 
fabricated with malicious intent. We are not aware that either university concluded fabrication or malicious 
intent, so if you have evidence to support this assertion, we would like to see and discuss it. 
The story concerns your actions towards students while a professor of physics at Case Western Reserve 
University, as well as your conduct in non-academic settings as a prominent figure in the skeptics movement. 
I am reporting this story along with two of my colleagues on the science desk, Azeen Ghorayshi and Virginia 
Hughes. 
Our story is about several allegations of sexual misconduct dating from 2006 to 2016 (see full details below). 
Our reporting also goes into how the various institutions you have been affiliated with — Case Western, 
Arizona State University, the Australian National University, the New College of the Humanities, and the 
Center for Inquiry, for which you serve as an honorary member of the board of directors — have handled 
complaints and concerns about your behavior during this time. 
Our story is corroborated by emails, university documents, official complaints, testimony from victims and 
eyewitnesses, and interviews with more than two dozen of your current and former academic colleagues, 
students, and peers in the skeptics movement. 
I wanted to offer you the opportunity to comment and/or respond to the main facts we plan to publish. If you 
wish to comment on any of the below findings, we need to hear from you as soon as possible. We are 
planning on publishing our story Tuesday morning, Eastern US Time. 
Based on our reporting, this is what we plan to publish: 
Incident 1: 
• In November of 2006, at an event launching the new Center for Inquiry in Washington D.C., you met a 
volunteer for CFI D.C. 
• At the event, you asked for her business card. Later, you followed her as she was leaving and asked 
her if she was of age. 
• Later, you emailed her to invite her to dinner. 
• You planned to dine with her in the restaurant at the Washington D.C. hotel where you were staying. 
• You told her to come up to your room first because you needed to finish some work. 
• In your hotel room, you seemed in no rush to leave. You ordered a cheese plate, and later champagne, 
despite her suggestion that you go down to dinner. 
• You then made a comment about her eye makeup, getting very close to her face. 
• You then lifted her by her arms, and pushed her onto the bed beneath you, forcibly kissing her and 
trying to pull down the crotch of her tights. 
• She struggled to push you off her. 
• You said, When I was in college I could never get a girl that looked like you. 
• When you pulled out a condom, she got out from under you. She said I have to go, and rushed out of 
the room. 
Incident 2: 
• In an incident that occurred in fall of 2007 while you were a physics professor at Case Western Reserve 
University, a student tried to talk to you about her plans after graduation. You mentioned to her how tough it 
must be to have all the other physics majors asking her out on dates. 
• In a second incident in December of 2007, while you were still at Case Western, the same student 
visited your office to interview you for a student science journal. You closed the door behind her, and ignored 
the questions she had prepared. Then you made a casual comment about taking her out for dinner. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021429 
• Later, in a regular column for the school paper, she described her experiences with you, without 
mentioning you by name. There was even one particular creep of a professor who once told me he thought 
differently of me compared to other students and asked me to dinner: a situation so disturbing that it left me 
upset for weeks afterward, she wrote. 
• She was then approached by a dean at the university, who suspected that she was referring to you, 
based on a previously reported incident with another student. He encouraged her to make a complaint, and 
she did. 
• University investigators interviewed both you and the student. 
• On September 4, 2008, Susan Nickel-Schindewolf, the university's associate vice president for student 
affairs, wrote to the student, telling her that the investigation was complete. She wrote that you had been told: 
This type of behavior could constitute sexual harassment in violation of the university's sexual harassment 
policy. 
• The letter also stated that you were prohibited from making contact with the student as long as she 
remained at Case. 
11 
• The letter also stated that you are required to get approval from the dean or the chair of the physics 
department before setting foot on the campus again. 
• The letter also stated, Dr. Krauss expressed regret about having a negative impact on you, and also 
his willingness to use this complaint as an opportunity to reflect and improve on his future interactions with 
students. 
• By then, you had already left Case, taking up your current position at Arizona State University the 
month before. 
• The opportunities being offered at ASU are simply too great to turn down at this stage in my career, 
you told Case colleagues, in an email announcing your departure on April 16, 2008. 
Incident 3: 
• A former Case Western physics department administrator confirmed that she had reported a previous 
incident involving a student who had confided in her about your inappropriate behavior towards her. 
Incident 4: 
• You met a student from another university, an atheist activist, in March 2008 at the American Atheists 
Convention in Minneapolis. She wanted to expand the atheist group she ran at the midwestern university she 
was attending, and hoped to convince you to come and speak. You initially seemed enthusiastic. 
• During the convention, attendees including you and Richard Dawkins went for dinner with the student 
and volunteers for Dawkins' foundation. 
• Afterwards, the student invited you to join the volunteers for a drink. 
• You asked her to come get you in your hotel room. She was wary of your intentions, and so brought a 
male friend with her. Opening the door to find them both there, you informed her you had decided not to go. 
• You met this student again at the American Atheists Convention in Des Moines, Iowa, in April 2011. 
• You pulled over a chair for her in the bar, and then started running your hand up her leg under the 
table. 
• She tried to shift her body away from you, and you persisted in putting your hand on her leg. She 
crossed her legs, and you kept trying. Then she turned her entire body away. 
Incident 5: 
• This incident allegedly occurred on in May 2011 on a CFI cruise. We understand that CFI staff were 
informed that you had propositioned a female cruise-goer, who rejected an invitation to join you and your 
female companion for sex in your cabin. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021430 
• At least two CFI staffers were sufficiently concerned about reports of your behavior that they urged 
CFI's president not to invite you on a 2014 cruise of the Galapagos Islands. You were invited on that cruise, 
however. 
Incident 6: 
• During a visit to Melbourne, Australia, in November 2016, you were accused of sexual misconduct once 
again. 
• The incident happened at a dinner held at the Melbourne Zoo as part of the Australian Skeptics  
National Convention, where you were a featured speaker. 
• With conference delegates chatting over drinks, a woman asked you for a celebrity selfie. 
• As the woman held out her phone to take the picture, you reached over her shoulder and grabbed her 
right breast. 
• She immediately reacted, bodychecking you and spinning around. Don't do that, she said. 
• BuzzFeed News has seen the complaint made by another woman to ASU, ANU, and the New College 
of the Humanities in London, including the selfie, her face obscured to conceal her identity. It shows your 
hand in motion as a blur in front of her shoulder, apparently moving toward her chest. Two other eyewitnesses 
have confirmed the complainant's account of what happened. 
• In April 2017, the complainant described the incident on her blog. After hearing more about your 
reputation for inappropriate behavior from blog readers, she decided to file a complaint about the Nov. 2016 
incident. 
• On July 16, she filed formal complaints with Arizona State University, and with the Australian National 
University in Canberra and the New College of the Humanities in London, where you have visiting 
appointments. 
• Both Arizona State and the Australian National University told her they would look into the matter. But 
neither university found against you. 
• Based on the material available to the University, we do not have sufficient evidence to substantiate 
the allegations, Kiaran Kirk, dean of the College of Science at the Australian National University, wrote to her. 
• Erin Ellison, who heads Arizona State's Office of Equity & Inclusion, wrote to her explaining that an 
inquiry did not find a violation of university policy. 
• In October, Arizona State denied a request from BuzzFeed News for documents relating to complaints 
of sexual harassment against you. However, Cynthia Jewett, the university's senior associate general 
counsel, noted that two individuals, neither affiliated with the university, had complained about you. The 
University did not find either communication to state a credible allegation, Jewett wrote. 
Miscellaneous facts: 
• In 2008, you founded the Origins Project at Arizona State University in Tempe, a multidisciplinary effort 
to understand the origins of the universe, life, and social systems. You have led that effort ever since. 
• Thanks to best-selling books like The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe From Nothing, frequent 
essays in publications including the New Yorker and the New York Times, and the documentary you made 
with biologist Richard Dawkins, called The Unbelievers, you are celebrated as one of America's leading public 
intellectuals. 
• You served on the science policy committee for Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign and are a 
vocal critic of President Donald Trump. 
• You also make regular public appearances across the world, often at gatherings of skeptics and 
atheists. 
• At CSICon in Las Vegas in October, a few dozen fans paid $500 per head to attend a VIP luncheon 
with you and Dawkins. 
• Many more lined up to get you to sign their copy of your latest book, The Greatest Story Ever Told — 
So Far. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021431 
• Online, people can buy T-shirts emblazoned Lawrence Krauss for President. 
• In talks and interviews, you have argued that our universe arose without divine intervention, that 
religion drives xenophobia, and that our brains are hardwired to believe. 
• You have stated that science provides answers to many of life's biggest questions, and can even fix 
great societal injustices. 
• Earlier this year, at a Q&A event to promote your new book, the conversation came around to the 
dearth of women and minorities in science. Science itself overcomes misogyny and prejudice and bias, you 
said. It's built in: Questioning yourself, always questioning results, questioning others, relying on empirical 
evidence. 
• You have clashed with some skeptics over your defense of Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire financier who in 
2008 was convicted for soliciting prostitution from underage girls, and spent 13 months in a Florida jail. 
• Through his private foundation, Epstein has funded the work of several prominent scientists. He has 
provided funding for your Origins Project, supporting lectureship and scholarship programs, most recently 
pledging $100,000 in 2014. 
• In April 2011, you told the Daily Beast: As a scientist I always judge things on empirical evidence and 
he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my 
presumption is that whatever the problems were I would believe him over other people. 
• In a blog comment about the Epstein controversy, you wrote: I remain skeptical, and I support a man 
whose character I believe I know.. .If you want to condemn me for that, so be it. 
• You were made an honorary member of CFI's board of directors in December 2011. 
• A blog post published in August 2013 described incidents #1 and #4, naming you. Another post, 
published at around the same time, described incident #5. 
• The first post was edited to remove your name after you had commented that the allegations of assault 
were potentially illegal. The second post was quickly taken down. 
Again, if you wish to comment on or clarify any of these points, please get in touch with us as soon as 
possible. If I do not respond immediately it is because I am on another call, so please leave the best phone 
number to reach you.

2006 she had been kept on a list that caused authorities to search her
at airports. As a result, she took elaborate countermeasures to evade
any possible surveillance of her communications.

Snowden knew about this incident because Greenwald described
it in great detail in a blog that Snowden read (as he later told Green-
wald). “Poitras is now forced to take extreme steps—ones that ham-
per her ability to do her work,” Greenwald wrote. “She now avoids
traveling with any electronic devices. She uses alternative methods
to deliver the most sensitive parts of her work—raw film and inter-
view notes—to secure locations. She spends substantial time and
resources protecting her computers with encryption and password
defenses. Especially when she is in the US, she avoids talking on
the phone about her work, particularly to sources. And she sim-
ply will not edit her films at her home out of fear—obviously well
grounded—that government agents will attempt to search and seize
the raw footage.” She claimed, as she told journalists, she was the
victim of “Kafkaesque government harassment.”

Snowden was duly impressed with her concerns about govern-

© ment surveillance, which he agreed was ubiquitous. Indeed, he later ®
described her as “more paranoid when it comes to electronic security
than I can be.” He meant it as a compliment. Such functional para-
noia or “operational security,” as Greenwald would call the precau-
tions that she took, dovetailed with Snowden’s growing conviction
that universal encryption was necessary to defeat the surveillance
state. It also made her the perfect channel for Snowden to safely pass
some of the classified documents he stole to Greenwald and other
journalists.

It was not difficult to get her to cooperate in his plot. He wrote,
for example, “The surveillance you've experienced means you have
been ‘selected’—a term which will mean more to you as you learn
how the modern SIGINT [signals intelligence] system works.” Just
as she had been “chosen” by her work to act as his conduit, accord-
ing to Snowden, she had been chosen by the NSA as a target because
of her work. The idea of her being “selected” by an invisible signals
intelligence agency, the NSA, could only excite her longtime con-
cerns about being watched by the government.

“Your victimization by the NSA system means that you are well

Search for next FBI director moves ahead quickly 
Attorney General Jeff Sessions interviewed eight candidates to replace fired FBI Director James 
Comey on Saturday, with President Donald Trump indicating that the nomination could be announced 
by Friday when he leaves for his first foreign trip. Potential replacements include FBI special agent 
Adam Lee, Judge Michael Garcia and former Justice Department employee Alice Fisher, who would 
be the first female director.

THE BUSINESS & POLITICS POLL 
What's your take on the Comey firing? 
President Donald Trump's sudden firing of FBI Director James Comey has stirred a flurry of calls for 
an independent investigation of the event and the FBI's probe into possible collusion between Trump's 
campaign and Russian officials. Critics say the president's action was a deliberate attempt to derail in 
FBI investigation, while defenders say the president acted properly and Comey deserved to be 
fired.This week's question: What's your take on the Comey firing? Cast your vote below. We'll 
post the results Friday. 
The president acted properly and within his powers 
The firing was legal but badly handled 
The firing could be seen as obstructing justice

Senators: Trump should relinquish Comey tapes 
Senators including Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on Sunday that if President 
Donald Trump recorded conversations with former FBI Director James Comey, 
he should provide those recordings to lawmakers. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-
N.Y., said Democrats might seek to delay a vote on a new FBI director until a 
special prosecutor is appointed to investigate potential connections between 
Trump and Russia.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014638.txt,"Norfolk Southern (NSC)

Our $122 price objective is based on a 19.5x multiple on our 2017 EPS estimate of
$6.25. We move above the top of its one-standard deviation historical trading range of
12x-16x given the new management team's move to improve margins, cut costs, and
raise its ROIC, and as EPS inflects off a volume deflated 19% decline in 2015.

Risks to our price objective and estimates are the company's ability to derive continued
operational benefits, a return to significant pricing competition among the rails, slower
than expected economic growth, a deterioration to improving service metrics, a heavily
unionized employee base, inability to exercise pricing power due to regulatory changes
or legal challenges from customers, external factors (such as weather) impacting
operations, and the STB installing mandatory reciprocal switching (or open access) to
the rail network without proper pricing.

SVB Financial Group (SIVB)

We use a three-factor valuation framework (P/TBV, P/E, DCF) to arrive at our $190 price
objective and assign a 2.3x multiple to our 2017e TBV and apply a 21x P/E to 17E EPS.
Our valuation multiples are both in line with high growth peers due to SIVB's high
profitability and EPS growth profile. Our DCF assumes a two-stage cost of capital of
9.5% and a terminal growth rate of 6%.

Downside risks are a longer than expected low rate environment and a slowdown in the
technology sector and related IPO activity. Upside risks are sooner than expected rate
hike, or better than expected pickup in the tech sector.

Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN)

Our $82 PO on TXN is based on14x FY17E EV/EBITDA, in line with high quality
diversified and analog peers trading at 14x-15x, given TXN's high quality business model
and strong FCF generation.

Risks to our price objective: 1} Lumpy telco capex, especially in wireless deployments, 2)
Volatile market share as design cycle times are very long, 3} Increased R&D spending
pressure to maintain an edge versus the competition, 4) Inventory cycles and potential
double ordering by customers that can often create mismatches between real supply
and demand, 5) Exposure to several mature markets such as PC and other consumer
electronics could limit its growth rate.

TripAdvisor (TRIP)

Our price objective of $41 is based on 21x our 2018 non-GAAP EPS estimate. This
multiple represents a premium to online travel/vertical media comps and in our view
adequately compensates TripAdvisor for improving margins and growth off a trough
point in FY16 into FY17 when the negative impacts of its IB transition peak.

Downside risks to our price objective are: 1) increasing competition (e.g. Yelp), 2} macro-
economic factors (e.g. recession in Europe) impacting the travel industry, 3} challenges
to the credibility of online reviews, 4) Instant Book transition puts pressure on revenue
growth, and 5) mobile monetization headwinds.

Upside risks to our price objective are: 1) improved mobile monetization 2} major OTA
sign on for instant booking 3) high non-hotel shopper dollar capture and 4) improved
global macro environment.

with Arafat still mute and unresponsive. That was the only way we could know
with certainty whether peace was possible. If it wasn’t, it would also demonstrate
powerfully to the Americans that we were not the party who had prevented an
agreement.

The President came to see me in Dogwood a little before 11 at night on the 18,
less than 12 hours before he was due to take his delayed flight to the G8. I told him
I’d decided to do what Rabin had done with Syria. I was going to give him a
“deposit” to keep in his pocket, which he would be free to use as the basis for a
further, American proposal to Arafat, assuming it was part of an agreement with a
“satisfactory resolution” of the refugee issue and an explicit end-of-conflict. He
could present it as something which he could tell Arafat he was confident of
persuading Israel to accept. It went well beyond what I’d offered before, on all the
major issues. I proposed Palestinian rule over 91 percent of the West Bank. I was
ready for a Palestinian state to have sovereignty over 85 percent of the border in
the Jordan Valley as well, and our security zone there would stay in place for “less
than 12 years.” Seven out of the nine outer Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem
would come under Palestinian sovereignty. The inner neighborhoods would be
under Palestinian civil authority: including planning and zoning, and law-
enforcement. For the mosques on the Temple Mount, I proposed a shared
custodianship to include the new state of Palestine, Morocco and the chair of the
Higher Islamic Commission in Jerusalem. I also agreed to consider Palestinian
sovereignty over both the Muslim and Christian quarters of the Old City.

Clinton, arching his eyebrows and smiling, said what I'd offered was a package
of genuine concessions. It was more than he had expected and, he assumed, more
than the Palestinians could have hoped for. It had the makings of a potential
breakthrough toward a fair and final peace. I told him I hoped so. But given
Arafat’s behavior so far, I had my doubts.

Now, it was our turn to wait. The President invited Arafat to Aspen and, from
what we heard soon afterwards, got no hint of any readiness to reciprocate. He
agreed only to talk to his negotiators and get back with an answer. Overnight, the
Palestinians sent messages to the Americans asking questions on each of the
concessions, though still with no indication from Arafat of a response. Finally, he
sent a suggestion that since Clinton was about to fly off to the G8, we take a two-
week break to allow Arafat to consult with Arab leaders. To his credit, Clinton
knew an escape act when he saw it. He recognized that only by confronting the

which refused accept women for many years, or Jewish clubs, which limit their memberships to
my own co-religionists. (More on this later.)

Judge Bazelon played hard and worked even harder. For his law clerks it was all work, no play.
We had to be in the office before he arrived, and his arrival time was never predictable, though his
secretary would sometimes tip us off about an unusually late or early arrival. We had to stay until
after he left, and he often worked late. He did not believe in vacation for the clerks—“It’s only a
one year job, and that means 365 days”—no personal time off. When I first came to work over
the summer, I asked him for a few days off to take a preparation course for the DC bar exam. He
assured me that I didn’t need time off to prepare! “I hired you because you were first in your law
school class. You don’t have to study for this test.” I told him I had been first because I always
prepared, but he was dismissive of my request. I tried to prepare myself late at night, but the
material was so dry and boring—the criteria to qualify for the “bulk sales act” and other
information I would never use—that I always fell asleep. “I’m going to fail the bar,” I told him
wortriedly, “and it may embarrass you.” He told me that one of his earlier star law clerks who was
my professor at Yale Law School had failed the bar and it didn’t embarrass him. Finally, he
relented when I told him that I was really having trouble focusing on the ridiculous bar exam
questions and he allowed me to leave a bit early for a week to take a crash course that met from
six to nine in the evening.

A few weeks after I took the exam, Judge Bazelon came storming out of his office holding a
paper and not smiling. I knew that he got advance notice of the bar results and I thought that he
was coming to tell me I had flunked. Instead he shouted, “You didn’t need time off. You got the
goddamn highest grade in the city. You’re a faker,” he complained, not bothering even to
congratulate me on passing.

Several months later when my second son, Jamin, was about to be born, I asked the judge for the
day off to accompany my wife to the hospital. He asked, “Isn’t Sue’s mother here?” She was.
“You did your part of the job already. You can visit after the baby is born. It isn’t your first
child. You don’t have to be there for the birth.”

Fortunately, he was traveling on the day of the birth and I made it to the hospital in time.

In light of these actions and attitudes, one can only imagine how shocked I was when Judge
Bazelon came back to the office from a lunch at the White House in mid-October and told his
entire staff, including his clerks, to “go home and be with your families.” He was grim-faced and
pale. “Why?” we asked. “There may be a nuclear attack,” he said solemnly. “I’ve just been
briefed on the presence of Soviet nuclear rockets in Cuba. Neither side is backing down. Nobody
wants war, but each side is calling the other’s bluff. No one knows how this will turn out. Go
home. Be with your families.”

We all left in a panic. Bazelon called me later that evening at home. “I have no faith in those
Kennedy brothers and their friends. They’re a bunch of spoiled brats—their fathers’ children, he

said contemptuously of Joseph Kennedy. I don’t like them and I don’t trust them. Look at the
way they screwed up the Bay of Pigs. A bunch of arrogant amateurs.”

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018204.txt,"The most effective resolution would be a negotiated outcome -- to achieve
it, Washington will need to take preliminary steps on several fronts. A
serious compromise needs to be put on the table, including an offer to
suspend crippling oil sanctions in return for specific, verifiable Iranian
steps to eliminate any nuclear breakout capabilities. Equally significant is
establishing a credible military threat, given that Tehran has been willing
to endure increasing economic pressure in order to continue its nuclear
program. The regime is unlikely to concede anything during negotiations
if it does not believe that Washington will actually follow through on such
threats. Although specific public redlines are often unpalatable, the Obama
administration must clarify internally when it would take military steps,
and these intentions must be made clear to the Iranians.

In the same vein, the military option requires a credible negotiating
complement, as seen in the early 1990s with Iraq. To legitimize military
action against Saddam Hussein's regime, Washington had to prove that all
other options had been exhausted. Similarly, the only way to set the
predicate for military action against Iran is to show the regime and the
international community that everything has been tried, and that
Washington has left Tehran with a way out. Failure to do so would
undermine the legitimacy of any strikes.

It is also important to understand that curtailing Iran's nuclear progress
will not by itself alter the regime's regional agenda -- nuclear ambitions
are but an extension of Tehran's wider aspirations toward hegemony in the
Middle East. Unfortunately, none of the longer-term proposals for
addressing that issue seem feasible at the moment (e.g., regime change by
internal or external means; a shift in Tehran's views on the Supreme
Leader and succession; a grand deal between Washington, Iran, and the
international community).

One lesson to be learned from past interactions with Tehran (or lack
thereof) is that when the United States proactively opposes Iranian
aggression in the Middle East, the regime relents, but when Washington
offers a more passive response, Iranian aggression increases. With respect
to Syria, for example, it cannot be assumed that Bashar al-Assad will fall
at all, let alone quickly, without active U.S. engagement. If the Assad

representative. To eliminate any doubt about the ability of corporate entities to assert their interests, the Rules should be
amended to clearly state that a victim's representative can enforce victims' rights. '73

Rule 2 - Fairness to Victims The Proposals:
I proposed amending Rule 2 to require fairness to victims in construing the Rules as follows:

These rules are to be interpreted to provide for the just determination of every criminal proceeding, to secure simplicity in
procedure and fairness in administration to the government, defendants, and victims, and to eliminate unjustifiable expense and
delay. 134

The Advisory Committee did not propose amending Rule 2. !*°
Discussion:

To assure that crime victims are treated fairly throughout the process, it makes sense to add language incorporating crime
victims in Rule 2 - the one rule that specifically mentions fairness. As discussed in the previous Part of this Article, the
Advisory Committee does not agree that the Rules should be amended to protect a victim's right to fairness and for this reason,
presumably, declined to amend Rule 2. The qualifier presumably is needed here because the CVRA Subcommittee did not
give an explanation for declining to follow my recommendation here. 146

The fairness issues appears to be the fundamental difference between my approach and the Advisory Committee's approach -
the Rules are either going to treat crime victims fairly or not. As discussed in the previous Part of this Article, they should.

But even those who share my view on fairness might nonetheless argue that Rule 2 need not be amended because it is an
interpretive rule with no substantive effect. After all, it could be argued, the rule simply calls for a just determination of
criminal cases, arguably a symbolic command. And, in any event, that command might be flexible enough to encompass crime
victims.

[*884] The debate about how Rule 2 ought to read is, however, about more than symbols. In 1946, the initial chairman of the

Advisory Committee called Rule 2 the most important rule of the whole set. !37 Rule 2 has been cited by a number of courts,

138 including the Supreme Court. !39 Rule 2 has consequences. Not only does it set[] forth a principle of interpretation for

I reported for induction on the second Sunday of November 1959, three
months short of my eighteenth birthday. Military service was a near-universal
rite of passage for Israeli teenagers. For children of the kibbutz, it held even
greater significance. Now that we had a country, the kibbutzniks’ role as the
avant-garde in taming and farming the land had ceased to be relevant. But the
sense of mission we’d been raised with — what we were led to believe set us
apart from the mere “city-dwellers” — drove us to aspire, maybe even assume,
we would leave an imprint in other spheres of the new state’s life. I doubt it’s an
accident that nearly every one of the boys with whom I grew up in Mishmar
Hasharon went on to become an officer during his time in the military.

Judging from my own first few weeks in uniform, however, there was every
reason to believe I would end up as an unfortunate, undistinguished exception.

This was not due to lack of ambition. In fact, I thought at first of joining the
air force. But a question on the application form asked whether I ever suffered
from any breathing discomfort. Like almost everyone on the kibbutz, I did get a
bit clogged up when the weather turned cold and damp. So I naively answered
yes, ending any chance of training as a pilot. My fallback choice was a tank
unit. But when I joined the hundreds of other draftees at the processing center
near Tel Aviv, about a hundred of us were shunted, by alphabetical lottery, into
training for armored personnel carriers instead. Known as battle taxis, the APCs
which Israel had at the time were lumbering, World War Two-vintage
halftracks.

Our training battalion was based, alongside the country’s main armored
brigade, in a huge, hillside army camp outside Beersheva in the Negev. I knew
that our fironut — basic training — would be tough. That was the whole point.
But we endured a seemingly endless array of inspections, under the watchful
eye of a corporal who meted out punishments for the tiniest scuff on a boot, a
belt, or a rifle. The rest of the time was spent in physical training, which I found
especially hard, at least at the beginning. I still weighed barely 130 pounds, and
by no means all, or even most, of it was muscle. My military career, such as it
was, looked very likely to involve spending my required couple of years baking
inside an APC in the Negev before moving on to something more useful, and
certainly more fulfilling, with the rest of my life.

Cannabis Investment Report | December 2017

An exhaustive review of each jurisdiction's laws is beyond the scope of this report; instead we discuss
issues commonly addressed by each category of cannabis laws.

Medical Cannabis Laws

In 1996, California enacted the first medical cannabis law of any U.S. state, followed in the late 1990s
by Alaska, Maine, Oregon and Washington. Since the beginning of 2000, 24 more states and the
District of Columbia have passed medical cannabis laws that permit the production and possession of
cannabis or concentrates for use in treating a broad range of qualifying medical conditions.

A state medical cannabis law permits a patient, with a doctor's recommendation, to use cannabis to
treat any qualifying medical condition designated by the law. It is illegal for a doctor to “prescribe” a
Schedule I controlled substance under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act (CSA), so medical cannabis
laws typically require a doctor’s “recommendation” rather than a prescription. Some medical cannabis
laws require a written recommendation, while others allow an oral recommendation. States may impose
a variety of other requirements or restrictions on a doctor or patient relating to medical cannabis access,
such as patient registration with a state medical cannabis registry, submission of a patient's fingerprints
or prohibition of use by convicted felons or certain government employees (for example, firefighters).

The number and nature of qualifying conditions included in medical cannabis laws vary widely.
Some laws designate relatively few or highly specific medical conditions, while other laws include many
conditions or highly subjective conditions, such as chronic pain. Some medical cannabis laws also
give doctors discretion to recommend cannabis for conditions not specifically designated. In aggre-
gate, across all medical cannabis laws in the United States, cannabis is legally recognized as a form of
therapy or medicine for more than 50 qualifying conditions. Common qualifying conditions include
Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), anorexia, arthritis, cachexia, cancer, chronic
pain, Crohn’s disease, epilepsy, glaucoma, hepatitis C, HIV/AIDS, inflammation, migraine, multiple
sclerosis (MS), nausea, nervous system degeneration, Parkinson’s disease, post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) and spasms.

Some medical cannabis laws restrict the form of cannabis or the means of consumption. For example,
Pennsylvania's medical cannabis law, enacted in 2016, prohibits smoking or vaporizing cannabis
flower, prohibits the incorporation of cannabis into foods by anyone other than the patient or the
patient’s caregiver, and authorizes cannabis to be dispensed only in certain concentrated forms.

Medical cannabis laws generally permit cannabis cultivation and distribution by a state-licensed
cultivator or dispensary, by a qualified patient or by a designated caregiver of the patient. A qualified
patient or the patient’s designated caregiver generally may grow only an amount of cannabis deemed
sufficient for the patient’s personal use. Some medical cannabis laws permit patients or caregivers to
grow cannabis only if they cannot practically obtain it by other means. For example, certain states
permit patients to grow cannabis only if they reside more than a specified distance from the nearest
licensed dispensary. Some states allow qualified patients and designated caregivers to collectively or
cooperatively aggregate their cultivation activities.

State-licensed cultivators and dispensaries must satisfy various licensing requirements related to

• Erika Najarian, BAML financials research analyst, just returned from a marketing trip. Bottom line: North American 
investors are very bullish the banks (long only AND hedge funds AND macro funds), but then conclude I don't own 
enough. Note that high touch flows have slowed down significantly since Thanksgiving and where the buying has been 
concentrated in XLF (every client sector we have has been a better buyer of XLF). 
• Client focus: 
1) Regulation: Excitement, with the base case that it's not getting worse. 
2) Sentiment on rates: Cautiously bullish 
3) Sentiment on growth: Also bullish 
4) Sentiment on corporate tax rate cuts: buyside more bullish than sellside. In 1986, bank stocks exploded upward 
(outperforming the S&P) after Reagan's tax reform bill passed the Senate; and 2) in 2003, the last time we saw personal 
tax cuts, loan growth industry wide accelerated in 2003 and 2004. 
• Biggest Pushback on owning sector at current levels: Too far too fast: BKX +18.00% post election: Valuation coming 
into question and 04 has typically been a seasonally weak qtr. Bulls defend valuation on '18ests with potential upside to 
2018 [PS from —25-40% and stocks still cheap vs. discretionary. 
• Price action and sentiment keeps us constructive, we like the long and would expect US financials to benefit from 
any beta chase into year end. 
• How to play it? We still like appearing call spreads on XLF 
o Buy a 6 month 105% call with a short 110% call that knock in if XLF trades above 115% during the life of the trade 
for 1.75% premium cost 
• Gross max payoff if knock-in is triggered: 2.8x (5.0%/1.75%) 
• Gross max payoff if knock-in is not triggered: 5.6x (9.9%/1.75%) — you have upside up to 114.9%

Subject: Financials: buy XLF call spreads 
Underweight positioning, buybacks resuming, positive momentum and strong fundamentals all indicate that there is still 
further upside potential in financials (more details below). Our financials sector specialist thinks XLF could have another 
20-25% upside given the many levers to the Trump Trade: less regulation, higher interest rates, higher vol, economic 
growth, loan growth, etc. The asset sensitive regional banks are more of a pure play on a rates move but we view the 
larger cap banks as having multi-pronged upside given the aforementioned points. 
That said, given the velocity and magnitude of the recent move and uncertainty around the impact and timing of 
Trump's policies, we believe options offer better risk-reward than being outright long financials stocks here. With flat 
call skew, appearing call spreads with upside knock-ins price well. 
Buy a 1 year XLF call spread for 2.6% premium 
• Buy a 110% call 
• Sell a 117.5% call with an at-expiry knock-in at 125% (call is not active unless XLF is 125% or higher at expiry) 
o Total premium is 2.6% 
o Gross max payoff if knock-in is triggered: 2.9x (7.5%/2.6%) 
o Gross max payoff if knock-in is not triggered: 5.7x (14.9%/2.6%) — you have upside up to 124.9% 
Post Election Flow Skews - Buyers of Health Care (via ETFs) and Financials (mainly ETFs) 
• US Buyback Flows 
• Cons Disc, Technology and Financials are the largest 3 sectors for US buybacks (over 70% of execution). We 
are seeing a seasonal increase in buybacks as we come out of the low seasonal month of the year (October) and should 
see increased buyback executions until year-end, another source of upside for the Cons Disc, Technology and Financials  
sectors.

Executive Summary

Breaking Down Democracy: Goals, Strategies,
and Methods of Modern Authoritarians

by Arch Puddington

The 21st century has been marked by aresurgence of authoritarian
rule that has proved resilient despite economic fragility and
occasional popular resistance. Modern authoritarianism has
succeeded, where previous totalitarian systems failed, due to refined
and nuanced strategies of repression, the exploitation of open
societies, and the spread of illiberal policies in democratic countries
themselves. The leaders of today’s authoritarian systems devote full-

time attention to the challenge of crippling the opposition without
annihilating it, and flouting the rule of law while maintaining a
plausible veneer of order, legitimacy, and prosperity.

Central to the modern authoritarian strategy is the
capture of institutions that undergird political plural-
ism. The goal is to dominate not only the executive
and legislative branches, but also the media, the
judiciary, civil society, the commanding heights of the
economy, and the security forces. With these institu-
tions under the effective if not absolute control of an
incumbent leader, changes in government through fair
and honest elections become all but impossible.

Unlike Soviet-style communism, modern authoritari-
anism is not animated by an overarching ideology or
the messianic notion of an ideal future society. Nor
do today's autocrats seek totalitarian control over
people's everyday lives, movements, or thoughts.
The media are more diverse and entertaining under
modern authoritarianism, civil society can enjoy an

independent existence (as long as it does not pursue
political change), citizens can travel around the coun-
try or abroad with only occasional interference, and
private enterprise can flourish (albeit with rampant
corruption and cronyism).

This study explains how modern authoritarianism de-
fends and propagates itself, as regimes from different
regions and with diverse socioeconomic foundations
copy and borrow techniques of political control.
Among its major findings:

« Russia, under President Vladimir Putin, has
played an outsized role in the development of
modern authoritarian systems. This is particu-
larly true in the areas of media control, propa-
ganda, the smothering of civil society, and the

relinquishes occupied Lebanese and Syrian territories and dismantles
it nuclear arsenal; cultural, political, and economic development of
the region; and equal rights of all people living on that land.

The new state will be diverse -- an amalgam of different nationalities
and faiths, all with equal rights and opportunities. To the Abrahamic
faiths, historic Palestine is the Holy Land. The majority of the
Palestinians see themselves as Arabs; as such, the new state should
have a special status in a more meaningful Arab League. The
nationalistic feelings of the Jewish population that link them to fellow
Jews worldwide must be recognised and upheld. The Jewish
population will, however, have to reject Zionism, a racist and
apartheid ideology based on 19th century European colonialist
thinking which preyed on the Jewish national feelings long before the
Palestinians became its victims.

The new state will bring fundamental changes in governance to the
region. Democracy based on equal opportunities will begin to take
hold with economic and military unions of the independent states of
the region. An EU-like union of the new state, Syria, Jordan and
Lebanon will enhance peace and reconciliation and will be a nucleus
for a larger regional union.

There are numerous challenges ahead. They range from developing
trust to rebuilding the infrastructure, the judicial, educational and
social institutions; from disposing of the nuclear arsenal to dealing
with the issues of confiscated lands, demolished homes and erased
towns and villages. The first step, however, is to go to the UN
General Assembly.

Etudes Internationales in Paris, and Dr Sarrif is a researcher in
Middle East studies.

Keeping track of seniors with Alzheimer's

Rosemary McClure, Special to the Los Angeles Times - May 29, 2010 - The email alert
shouted its message: Missing Person with Alzheimer's. PLEASE HELP. It was sent to
Alzheimer's Assn. chapters and to law enforcement officials within hours after an Orange County
woman disappeared while on a short trip to visit a friend.

The woman had set out in her car, made a wrong turn and became confused, says her family, who
asked that her name not be used to protect her privacy.

ratified and with international law that Western powers developed
and have imposed on China while it was weak and that it now is set
on revamping the international system.

In other words China is indeed serious about its nine-dashed line
claim to all features, waters and resources of the South China Sea and
it alone will decide the passage regime to be imposed therein.

This is radical and could lead to war.Otherwise, China could claim
most of what it wants by using existing international law and the Law
of the Sea Treaty. It could claim the features and, for legal islands, a
continental shelf and 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone for
each. Of course it would have to negotiate boundaries with the other
claimants.

But that is the present situation anyway and China's legal position is
very weak. The area claimed would be almost the same as that within
the nine-dashed line and the argument would be legitimate —
supported by the convention.

Regarding the navigational issues with the U.S., the U.S. has not
ratified the convention and has little legitimacy in arguing it or its
interpretation thereof. The U.S. would be widely seen as a bully if
it tried to force its interpretation on the world.

The puzzle is that China has excellent experts on Law of the Sea who
are aware of this opportunity and yet China seems to be eschewing
this option.

Perhaps U.S. strategy and tactics have pushed a portion of China's
military leadership over the edge. Maybe they have concluded from
what they perceive as the U.S. containment policy and the constant
and active probing by high-tech spy vessels and planes that war is
inevitable. In this scenario China feels it must defend its exposed
underbelly and push its defense zone as far south and seaward as
possible.

hypotheses in plumbing as well as in medicine and that these expla-
nations exist for repairing a faulty engine and for understanding who
committed a crime. It is all scientific reasoning.

The difference between plumbing and medicine is in the complex-
ity of the science. Not a lot of invention goes on in plumbing and
there aren’t all that many explanations to choose from. The degree of
difficulty in understanding what is going on and why is what sepa-
rates those fields and makes one science and one not. But the basic
thought processes are the same.

This is important to notice because all these areas of inquiry are
what we might call diagnostic.

So, and this is the important part, the real issue from a cognitive
science point of view is not in teaching science per se, but in teaching
scientific activities, one of which is diagnosis. And, since diagnosis is a
similar process no matter what you are diagnosing, it makes sense that
all through school, diagnosis would be a subject, and not physics or
literature. The things that children are asked to diagnose might start
with things little kids like, like finding out what is wrong with their
pets or their toys, and then move on to things bigger kids like, like cars
and crime, and then move on to large issues, like why a business has
failed or why our foreign policy doesn’t work.

Diagnosis matters a great deal in our lives, yet it is not a subject in
school. This is not surprising because the origins of the school subject
areas, as I have said, are scholarly. But if we want to teach children to
do things that matter and we want to retain their interest because they
know intrinsically that these things do matter, then we must have
them practice diagnosis all through their school lives, in a variety of
venues that correlate with their interests. They don’t all have to diag-
nose the same stuff. It is the diagnostic process itself that matters, not
what is diagnosed.

I have been using the word subject for an idea like diagnosis but it
is not a subject and should not be seen that way. I have been using the
word only to contrast it to existing subjects in school. Diagnosis is a
fundamental cognitive activity. Cavemen did diagnosis. They may not
have done it well, but they did it well enough to continue the species.
The diagnostic process is as old as people. Knowing why, being able to
prove a hypothesis, is a fundamental cognitive process.

School needs to be organized around fundamental cognitive ac-
tivities. It would be easy to demean what I have said here by saying

to be given real world application. To be sure, it is a broad right - akin to the defendant's broad right to due process of law. °!
But to implement that right in the criminal rules is not creating new victims rights not based upon the statute, as the Advisory
Committee puts it, but simply implementing a clearly articulated congressional command.

It is a cardinal principle of statutory construction that effect must be given to every word ina statute. °* Under the Advisory
Committee's approach, the congressional directive that crime victims be treated fairly will have no effect on [*875] any of the
Rules. The fairness directive will, in other words, be rendered mere surplusage - something that the Supreme Court has
repeatedly cautioned against. ®?

The Advisory Committee also admits that it is interpreting the CVRA narrowly, contrary to the standard rule that remedial
legislation is to be construed broadly. °4

In addition, the Advisory Committee's approach flouts the declared intentions of the Act's drafters. There is no need to guess
about Congress's intent on the right of fairness. Senator Kyl, who cosponsored the CVRA with Senator Feinstein, explained
quite directly that Congress meant for the right to have substantive content:

The broad rights articulated in this section [section 8, mandating victims be treated with fairness along with dignity and
respect] are meant to be rights themselves and are not intended to just be aspirational. One of these rights is the right to be
treated with fairness. Of course, fairness includes the notion of due process. 8°
Nor is there any doubt that Congress intended this command to reach the judiciary, including judicial branch components like
the Advisory Committee. Again, Senator Kyl specifically addressed this point:

Too often victims of crime experience a secondary victimization at the hands of the criminal justice system. This provision
[section 8] is intended to direct government agencies and employees, whether they are in executive or judicial branches, to treat
victims of crime with the respect they deserve and to afford them due process. *®

The Advisory Committee's decision not to treat fairness as an enforceable right is so at odds with the CVRA's legislative
history that one becomes curious as to why the Advisory Committee determined not to follow it. The Advisory Committee also
diverged from the legislative history in several other areas. 7 In reviewing the Advisory Committee's records, however,
notably absent is any mention of legislative intent. The Advisory Committee does not cite the statute's [*876] legislative

Business

France maintains a negative trade balance with China and Chinese companies have
not invested much in France compared to what they’ve poured into Germany, Italy,
and the United Kingdom. Chinese investors reduced investments during the 2016-17
presidential campaign and have also met with informal refusals in some cases, such
as Areva, the French nuclear company. The Chinese domestic market is set to save
France’s dairy industry, even creating a temporary shortage of butter for the first time
since 1945. Still, complaints over too many purchases—or too many tourists, for that
matter——are drowned out by the profits involved.

In mainland France, the Comité France-Chine of MEDEF, the French business union,
has always been a prominent link, usually spearheaded by a prominent former French
political figure (from Raymond Barre to Valéry Giscard d’Estaing and Jean-Pierre
Raffarin). A separate French-Chinese investment fund has also been created, headed by
a former senior official in the treasury department.

Until very recently, Sino-French activities were largely financed by major French firms
operating in China, with EDF, the semipublic electricity company that cooperates on
nuclear plants with China, being the most prominent. EDF has been criticized for its
transfers of technology to China, which it justifies by its contracts in China and the
United Kingdom with Chinese co-funding. This pattern of lobbying by the French
themselves may be changing. Huawei now appears as a frequent donor, including
for public conferences taking place in such prestigious locales as the French National
Assembly or Senate.

Quiet Chinese investments with ownership below the 10 percent declaratory level, as
well as in real estate, make for more diffuse influence. This is particularly true at the
local level, where Chinese investors are eagerly sought and business intermediaries
tend to mushroom. Many plans for industrial parks and regional airports have not
materialized, however. The partial takeover of the Toulouse airport (home of Airbus
and other aerospace firms) has been marred by the temporary arrest in China of the
lead Chinese investor and by a search for quick profits.

Academia

In general, French academic and scientific institutions have welcomed Chinese
students and researchers. The Commissariat a l’Energie Atomique (CEA), Ecole
Polytechnique, and the Paris Saclay cluster and science park are all active in working
with Chinese counterparts. The Paris Saclay cluster and science park has signed

cost, efficiency, and quality issues within the healthcare system.

The ACA and other healthcare reform initiatives are challenged by dual and somewhat
conflicting objectives. They are focused on reducing costs and slowing growth rates in
spending, but at the same time expand the size of the population that has access to healthcare
covered by third party payment mechanisms. In order to cover the increased costs of the
expanded coverage, reform initiatives attempt to radically improve the efficiency of healthcare
delivery as a way of freeing up resources that can be redirected to providing care to populations
that had previously not been covered. Some of the lowest hanging fruit that is being targeted in
early reform initiatives is eliminating waste from the healthcare system. There are enormous
resources that can be freed up by eliminating expenditures that are unnecessary or duplicative.
In the U.S. healthcare system alone, there is an estimated $765 billion that is wasted annually.
More than half of that total ($415 billion) is the result of fraud, unnecessary services, and
inefficiently or mistakenly delivered care. Another 25%+ of the total ($190 billion) is the result
of excess administrative costs (eg., inefficiencies associated with paperwork and
documentation)?”. Finding ways to reduce waste in the system offers the opportunity to create
significant value, but requires the adoption of entirely new tools and technologies by payers,
providers, and patients. Developing these tools, applications, and systems is an area of
significant opportunity for innovative technology focused companies.

A major part of eliminating waste in healthcare will be accomplished by driving efficiency and
deriving maximum benefit from the enormous levels of current expenditures. Achieving this
goal will have to include a fundamental change in focus to the principles of value-based
medicine across all levels of the healthcare system. This is a radical change in objectives that is
already happening, and it is leading to entirely new reimbursement models built around paying
for technologies and treatments that provide care efficiently and at a cost proportional to the
health benefit they deliver. Value-based medicine focuses on outcomes from healthcare
services, which more closely aligns the interests of the payers with the healthcare providers and
product companies whose services and products are the major cost elements in the delivery of
healthcare. Although simple conceptually, this is a fundamental change in how healthcare is
paid for from the historical reimbursement models that have focused on fixed payments for
delivery of discrete procedures, with no corresponding emphasis on quality of the care
delivered or on the resulting patient outcomes.

Refocusing treatment objectives within the healthcare system towards high quality outcomes
over numbers of procedures will require many healthcare companies to reengineer aspects of
their business models, but it will also provide them with new opportunity. In a system that
rewards outcomes, companies and organizations that run with the highest quality and most
efficiently will have significant opportunity to expand their own returns by taking on risk in the
treatment of patients. Opening the market to this dynamic, where there is opportunity to earna
return on cost-effective, high quality patient management and outcomes, will stimulate the
development and adoption of an entirely new set of enabling technologies and business models,
which represent opportunity for innovative, technology-based, development and growth stage
companies.

1. Verifying with the appropriate state authorities whether the business is duly licensed and
registered.

2. Reviewing the license application (and related documentation) submitted by the business for
obtaining a state license to operate its marijuana-related business.

3. Requesting from state licensing and enforcement authorities available information about the
business and related parties.

4. Developing an understanding of the normal and expected activity for the business, including
the types of products to be sold and the type of customers to be served (for example, medical
versus recreational customers).

5. Ongoing monitoring of publicly available sources for adverse information about the business
and related parties.

6. Ongoing monitoring for suspicious activity, including for certain red flags described in the
FinCEN Memo.

7. Refreshing information obtained as part of customer due diligence on a periodic basis and
commensurate with the risk.

The FinCEN Memo also guides financial institutions to file various SARs with FinCEN regarding
customers engaged in marijuana-related businesses. According to the memorandum, an institution
should file (i) a “Marijuana Limited” SAR for each customer it believes does not violate state law or
implicate any Cole Memo priority, (ii) a “Marijuana Priority” SAR for each customer it believes vio-
lates state law or implicates any Cole Memo priority, and (iii) a “Marijuana Termination” SAR if the
institution decides to terminate a customer relationship in order to maintain an effective anti-money
laundering compliance program. The FinCEN Memo outlines certain “red flags” that tend to indicate
which type of SAR filing is appropriate; red flags include the inability of a customer to demonstrate
compliance with state law or deposits of amounts of cash inconsistent with its tax returns.

FinCEN periodically publishes information about marijuana-related SAR filings made by deposi-
tory institutions. From the February 2014 FinCEN Memo publication through June 30, 2017,
FinCEN received a total of 33,692 marijuana-related SAR filings from a total of 390 banks and credit
unions. The following graphs based on FinCEN data show the number of monthly Marijuana Limited,
Marijuana Priority and Marijuana Termination SAR filings for this period and the number of banks
and credit unions making such filings.

millennia. Just as computers have
capacities and processes that are
transduced through but extend far
beyond the hardware of a single
computer, the human brain has evolved
to promote social and cultural capacities
and processes that are transduced
through but that extend far beyond a
solitary brain. To understand the full
capacity of humans, one needs to
appreciate not only the memory and
computational power of the brain but its
capacity for representing, understanding,
and connecting with other individuals.
That is, one needs to recognize that we
have evolved a powerful, meaning
making social brain.

Social species, by definition,
create structures beyond the individual—
structures ranging from dyads and
families to institutions and cultures.
These emergent structures have evolved
hand in hand with neural and hormonal
mechanisms to support them because the
consequent social behaviors (e.g.,
cooperation, empathy, altruism, etc.)
helped these organisms survive,
reproduce, and care for offspring
sufficiently long that they too
reproduced. From an evolutionary
perspective then, the social context is
fundamental in the evolution and
development of the human brain.

The observable consequences of
these higher organizations have long
been apparent, but we are only now
beginning to understand their genetic,
neural, and biochemical basis and
consequences. To fully delve into these
complex behaviors, science needs to deal
with the invisible forces that shape
human life, whether it is in the form of
physical, biological, or psychological
forces. For instance, anthropomorphism,
the irrepressible proclivity to attribute

Page |14

human characteristics onto nonhuman
objects to achieve meaning,
predictability, and human connection, is
beginning to be subjected to productive
multi-level scientific analysis.
Experimental studies have shown that
manipulations which increase feelings of
social isolation without the possibility of
resolving these feelings through human
interaction have the compensatory effect
of increasing people’s tendency to
anthropomorphize, including heightened
beliefs in God. This scientific work has
implications for understanding claims
regarding the success of religious
practices such as solitude as paths to
feeling closer God. Research on
anthropomorphism has now identified
developmental, situational, dispositional,
and cultural factors that modulate
people’s tendency to anthropomorphize
nonhuman agents ranging from
technological gadgets to animals to gods,
and the neural mechanisms underlying
this transconfiguration of nonhuman
objects into human-like agents are
beginning to be revealed.

Guided by the insights from
these new scientific theories of
anthropomorphism, historical analyses
may be worthwhile to determine whether
concepts of god have changed across
time and cultures such that god was
created in the image of the believer
rather than vice versa. Xenophanes (6th
century B.C., cited in 9), for instance,
was apparently the first to use the term
“anthropomorphism” when describing
the similarities between religious agents
and their believers, noting that Greek
gods were invariably fair skinned and
blue-eyed whereas African gods were
invariably dark skinned and dark-eyed
(joking that cows would surely worship
gods that looked strikingly cow-like).

simply to withdraw the paper. Clinton’s answer encouraged, and surprised, me.
“We agree,” he said. “The paper no longer exists.” It soon turned out the
Palestinians were unhappy with it too, but for another reason. On the lookout for
validation of Arafat’s insistence that Camp David was an Israeli “trap”, they were
convinced that the paper had Israel’s fingerprints all over it. That wasn’t true. The
one change we’d insisted on was because it misrepresented our position on
Jerusalem. Still, since Dennis had added the word “expanded” to the Jerusalem
section in longhand, the Palestinians were convinced of Israel co-authorship.

In fact, three days into the summit, the mood among the Palestinians seemed
increasingly aggrieved. Not just the Americans, but some members of my own
team, were urging me to show more “personal warmth” towards Arafat. I did
always exchange greetings and pleasantries with him at mealtimes in Laurel
Lodge, but even there, I admit, that I didn’t exactly show enthusiasm, much less
ebullience. After one dinner, when I’d been placed between the Palestinian leader
and Chelsea Clinton, the President’s National Security Adviser, Sandy Berger,
asked me why, rather than talking to Arafat, I’d spent almost the entire time
chatting with Chelsea. My response was only half-joking: “Given the choice, who
wouldn’t?”

It wasn’t only that I believed a charm initiative would come over as contrived. I
didn’t want to risk misleading Arafat, the other Palestinians and possibly the
Americans as well, by giving them the impression I was satisfied with the progress
of the summit, or felt that we were heading towards any serious engagement and
compromise on the core issues. I had met Arafat many times before Camp David. I
had made it clear in all of those meeting that, despite differences on a range of
difficult issues, I did want a final peace agreement and that I was ready to consider
the tough decisions necessary to make it possible. At Camp David, I was not
against meeting Arafat as a matter of principle. I simply felt the time for such a
meeting, if it came, would be at the moment that we saw at least some signal of a
readiness on his part to negotiate seriously.

Still, given the strength of feeling among some of my own negotiators, I felt a
responsibility to give it a try. I told Yossi Ginossar, the former Shin Bet officer
who was closest to the Palestinian leader among the Israelis, to set up an informal
meeting. I added, to Yossi’s obvious satisfaction and surprise, that I'd be willing to
have the meeting in Arafat’s cabin if that’s what he preferred. The next afternoon, I
went there for tea and baklava. Abu Mazen, his top political adviser and the main

(“Giuffre”), for her Complaint against Defendant, GHISLAINE MAXWELL (“Maxwell”), avers
upon personal knowledge as to her own acts and status and otherwise upon information and
belief:
NATURE OF THE ACTION

1. This suit arises out of Defendant Maxwell’s defamatory statements against
Plaintiff Giuffre. As described below, Giuffre was a victim of sexual trafficking and abuse while
she was a minor child. Defendant Maxwell not only facilitated that sexual abuse but, most
recently, wrongfully subjected Giuffre to public ridicule, contempt and disgrace by, among other
things, calling Giuffre a liar in published statements with the malicious intent of discrediting and
further damaging Giuffre worldwide.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2. This is an action for damages in an amount in excess of the minimum
jurisdictional limits of this Court.

SAT scores, there would be little diversity,” he explained. He too apparently believed in the
“Yiddisher (and Asian) Kup” theory.)

I did not come close to having an 82 average, but fortunately there was also a test that an
applicant with non-qualifying grades could take. Unfortunately, a high score alone on the test did
not get you in: you needed a combined score—test plus grade average—to make the cut. With
my low average, I needed a near perfect score to make it. Otherwise I would have to go to night
school and work during the day. I did very well on the test and was admitted.

I also won a New York State Regents Scholarship which paid me $1,400 to go to college. (I put
the money in an interest bearing account that paid for my first year at law school.) The state
scholarship was based entirely on a single, highly competitive exam. High schools took great
pride in how many state scholarships their students won. The relevant statistic that helped rank
the schools was the percentage of those who won, based on the number of students who took the
exam. My high school was obsessed with doing well in the state scholarship competition, so it
limited those who could take the exam to students with grade points over 80, in order to inflate
the percentage of winners. I did not qualify, but I knew I could do well on a state-wide
competitive exam that was graded by outsiders, not by my teachers who were predisposed against
me. So I pleaded with Rabbi Zuroff to take the exam. He refused, telling me I would never win
and my taking it would just bring down the percentage. Not satisfied with his answer, I filed a
petition with the New York Regents—my first of many petitions. To everyone’s surprise, the
Regents ruled in my favor and the school was ordered to let me, and everyone else, take the
exam. Two of us, who had averages below 80, along with 4 or 5 others, won the scholarship.

My principal’s first reaction was that I must have cheated, but a check of the seating chart showed
that I was not sitting near anyone else who won. So off I went to Brooklyn College, with money
in my bank account. It was a turning point for me academically, professionally, religiously and
existentially.

Before I turn to my college and law school years, which were quite successful, I want to speculate
for a moment as to why, despite the unsuccessful nature of my early teen years, I am so focused
on them as so formative to my later life. Several years ago, Zhe New York Times Magazine asked
me to reflect back on my teen years for a column entitled About Men. The assignment got me to
wonder why I am so obsessed with nostalgia from that particular period in my life. This is part of
what I wrote:

I'M ENTERING THAT AGE WHEN songs from the hit parades of my adolescence bring
tears of nostalgia. I'm a sucker for memorabilia of the 1950's.

My house is cluttered with toys I've recently bought - chintzy replicas of vintage Chevys
and Thunderbirds, overpriced miniature jukeboxes that play Rock Around the Clock,
anything reminiscent of the 1955 world champion Brooklyn Dodgers (a redundancy to any
aficionado, because there are no other world champion Brooklyn Dodgers).

I rush to see any Woody Allen film that has even a remote connection to the time and
place we both grew up in (another redundancy - everything Woody Allen does has a
strong connection to Brooklyn in the 50's). I drag my family to Neil Simon plays through

Masoud Alimohammadi; the nuclear physicist was killed when it was
detonated by remote control.

In the broadcast, Fashi accurately described the Mossad campus north of
Tel Aviv. He said he had been given a laptop equipped with a second
operating system and used it to communicate through online drop boxes.
He was impressed by his handlers’ thoroughness. At one point Fashi
described studying a scale model of Alimohammadi’s street. “It was an
exact copy of the real one,” Fashi said. “The tree next it, the street curb,
the bridge.” In a later broadcast, he was seated across from
Alimohammadi’s widow, who glared at him as he bowed his head and
wept. Mossad officials were “pissed off and shocked” seeing their agent
on television, the intelligence official said.

Fashi was executed in May 2012. About the same time, Iran’s intelligence
minister announced the arrest of 14 more Iranians, eight men and six
women dubbed members of the “Terror Club” in the subsequent_prime-
time broadcast of that name. Filmed in shadow, and rich in atmospherics,
the Aug. 5 program recreated Alimohammadi’s death and four subsequent
attacks: they started with the Nov. 29, 2010 nearly simultaneous attempts
on Majid Shariari and Fereydoun Abbasi, nuclear scientists driving to
work when magnetic “sticky bombs” were attached to the side of their cars
from passing motorcycles. Abbasi managed to escape before it detonated,
saving his wife as well. Shariari was killed — a significant setback for the
Iranian nuclear program where he was the top scientist, according to a
Western intelligence official.

The confessed agents offered absorbing detail — they were aboard a Bajaj
Pulsar, wearing helmets, when the magnet bomb stuck on the right front
panel of Shariari’s car exploded. The riders scrambled into the “trail car”
assigned to follow the target and disappeared into the traffic of the Imam
Ali Autobahn. Already gone was the car assigned to cut off and slow the
car carrying the scientist. They claimed to have rehearsed on a practice
track inside Israel. None of the details could be confirmed, but an
intelligence official acknowledged: “Another network was taken.”

Aftercare is part of that boundary-setting process, but a lot of the time, people have a hard
time thinking or speaking clearly right after S&M. Some people become incredibly non-
verbal, or vague and confused, or giggly, or all of the above. For this reason, some people
include later follow-ups (like a next-day phone call) under the umbrella of aftercare --
the goal is to allow the post-S&M time to be calming and un-challenging, and then talk
things through when everyone's head is clearer. Processing things thoroughly after an
S&M encounter is really important, especially if the people involved are planning to do it
again. It's important for two reasons: it helps the people involved get a better sense of
what they want and don't want; and it helps them learn more about how to communicate
with their partners.

Recently, I was privileged to give a partner his first heavy S&M experience. Afterwards,
when he was coming out of it, he said to me: No one has ever touched me so deeply, so
fast before. I lay with him, listening. I'm pretty sure I did a good job helping him pick up
the pieces, but when I try to figure out what I did, I have trouble describing it.

So I wouldn't know how to give a step-by-step how to for aftercare, but I can offer
some thoughts. For one thing, the person who was dominant during the encounter is
usually the person who runs the aftercare, too. When I'm in the dominant position, the
message I try to get across during aftercare is along these lines: I'm here, I'm listening, I
care about you, you're safe with me, and you can take all the time you need.”

In the submissive position, I'm often too busy processing to think carefully about what
message I'm getting across to my partner. But sometimes I do get the sense that he's
confused or anxious or needs some feedback, at which point I try to get across a message
along these lines: I care about you and I'm so grateful to you for taking on that power
just now. If you need to talk, we will do that when I'm more alert. But for now, let's
please just be here together and establish our closeness.”

And when I'm switching -- or when the power dynamic is otherwise unclear -- well. I
guess I try to get across a combination of those messages.

The Boundaries of S&M Intimacy

I used to be more willing to do S&M on the first date,” when I barely knew my partner.
That's changed for two reasons. Firstly, I've become much warier of doing S&M without
a strong foundation to the relationship. I've been lucky, because my partners have treated
me so well, even the casual ones. (As more stories of S&M and abuse become public, I
realize more and more how lucky I've been.) But I don't ever want to be in a position
where I do intense S&M and I can't rely on my partner afterwards; and the best way to
build a reliable foundation is to spend lots of time together before we get into anything
deep.

Secondly, I've become more aware of how quickly S&M can affect me. It's entirely
possible to do excellent, intense S&M with someone I can't trust. And if that happens,
then boom: I'll be intensely bonded to him, yet unable to trust him. It's not a good place to
be. There are some kinds of S&M that feel light or even impersonal to me, but when I do
things that feel intense... the bond forms so fast, and it's so incredibly strong. I swear it's a

—EDWARD SNOWDEN, Moscow, 2013

D OWNLOADING NSA documents was not Snowden’s only rogue
activity while working at the NSA for Dell in 2012. Three
weeks after the CryptoParty, Snowden began anonymously contact-
ing a high-profile journalist. He used the same alias, Cincinnatus,
that he used with Sandvik and to advertise the Oahu CryptoParty.
The journalist to whom he wrote on December 1, 2012, was Glenn
Greenwald, the previously mentioned Rio-based columnist for The
Guardian.

Greenwald had not always been an activist journalist. He had
been a litigation lawyer at the elite New York firm of Wachtell, Lip-
ton, Rosen & Katz. He was also an entrepreneur, owning part of
Master Notions, a company that, among other things, had a 50 per-
cent financial interest in the pornographic website HJ (an acronym
that originally stood for “Hairy Jock”). All did not go well with this
enterprise. In 2004, Greenwald became involved in an acrimonious
lawsuit with his other associates in HJ. As a result, he had a number

board a plane under the pretext of a freedom flight, and then once in flight, were thrown out of the plane,
adding sheer terror to the brutality of their death. Accounts such as these litter the pages of history. They
reveal that the desire to impress with excess is part of human nature.

What we have learned in this chapter is that our biology hands us the tools for excess, and hands
some of us more than our fair share. This does not mean that we will or must use such tools. It also
doesn’t mean that the tools were designed for excess. Some are endowed with genes that predispose to
sensation-seeking and risk-taking, others to brain circuitry and chemistry that create an insatiable desire
for reward. Different environments either encourage this biology or discourage it, a topic that occupies
chapter 4. As the eighteenth century poet William Blake remarked “The road to excess leads to the palace
of wisdom... for we never know what is enough until we know what is more than enough.” To more
deeply understand how our desires runaway to excess, we need to understand how the mind facilitates this
process. We need to understand the role of denial. We need to understand how individuals and groups
dehumanize the other and self-deceive themselves into believing that those unlike them represent a threat
to their purity and power. We need to understand how desire and denial combine to pave the way to

excessive harms.

Cite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)

Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 253, 78
§.Ct. 1228, 2 L.Ed.2d 1288 (1958)).

[52] For purposes of the minimum con-
tacts inquiry, a distinction is made be-
tween specific and general jurisdiction.
Specific jurisdiction exists when the forum
exercises jurisdiction over the defendant in
a suit arising out of the defendant’s con-
tacts with that forum. Metro. Life Ins. 84
F.3d at 567-68. General jurisdiction is
based on the defendant’s general business
contacts with the forum; because the de-
fendant’s contacts are not related to the
suit, a considerably higher level of contacts
is generally required.™ Jd. at 568.

2. Reasonableness

[53] In determining whether the exer-
cise of personal jurisdiction is reasonable,
a court is to consider:

(1) the burden that the exercise of juris-

diction will impose on the defendant; (2)

the interests in the forum state in adju-

dicating the case; ©) the plaintiffs in-
terest in obtaining convenient and effec-
tive relief; (4) the interstate judicial
system’s interest in obtaining the most
efficient resolution of the controversy;
and (5) the shared interest of the states
in furthering substantive social policies.

Metro. Life, 84 F.3d at 568 (citing Asahi
Metal Indus. Co. v. Superior Court, 480
U.S. 102, 1138-16, 107 S.Ct. 1026, 94
L.Ed.2d 92 (1987)). “These considerations
sometimes serve to establish the reason-
ableness of jurisdiction upon a lesser show-
ing of minimum contacts than would other-
wise be required.” Burger King, 471 U.S.
at 477, 105 S.Ct. 2174.

[54] There obviously are competing
policy considerations at play here. In gen-

34. At oral argument, Plaintiffs focused on
specific jurisdiction, see Oct. 12, 2004 Tran-
script at 44, but Plaintiffs include general
jurisdiction arguments in many of their oppo-

eral, “‘great care and reserve should be
exercised when extending our notions of
personal jurisdiction into the international
field’” Asahi Metal Indus. 480 U.S. at
115, 107 8.Ct. 1026 (quoting United States
v. First Nat'l City Bank, 379 U.S. 378, 404,
85 S8.Ct. 528, 138 L.Ed.2d 365 (1965) (Har-
lan, J., dissenting)). “[T]he unique bur-
dens placed upon one who must defend
oneself in a foreign legal system should
have significant weight in assessing the
reasonableness of stretching the long arm
of personal jurisdiction over national bor-
ders.” Jd. at 114, 107 S.Ct. 1026. On the
other hand, “[t]here is some merit ... to
the plaintiffs’ argument that no foreign
terrorist today can fairly assert a lack of
‘fair warning’ that it could be ‘haled into
court’ in [this forum.]” Beton v. Palestine-
an  Interrm Self-Government, 310
F.Supp.2d 172, 178 (D.D.C.2004).

C. Jurisdictional Discovery

[55,56] Plaintiffs urge the Court to
deny Defendants’ motions and order juris-
dictional discovery. In evaluating jurisdic-
tional motions, district courts enjoy broad
discretion in deciding whether to order
discovery. See, eg., APWU v. Potter, 348
F.3d 619, 627 (2d Cir.2003) (noting a court
may “devis[e] the procedures [to] ferret
out the facts pertinent to jurisdiction”);
Marine Midland Bank, N.A. v. Miller, 664

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027867.txt,"Though both my parents were part of the pioneer generation, my mother,
unlike my father, actually arrived as a pioneer, part of a Jewish youth group
from Poland that came directly to the kibbutz. In addition to being more
naturally outgoing than my father, she came to see Mishmar Hasharon has her
extended family and spent every one of her one hundred years there.

Esther Godin, as the then was, grew up in Warsaw. Born in 1913, she was
the oldest of the six children of Samuel and Rachel Godin. Poland at the time
was home to the largest Jewish community in the world, more than 3 million by
the time of the Holocaust. While the Jews of Poland had a long history, the
Godins did not. Before the First World War, my mother’s parents made their
way from Smolensk in Russia to Warsaw, which was also under czarist rule.
When the war was over, the Bolshevik Revolution had toppled the czars. Poland
became independent, under the nationalist general Josef Pilsuldski. The Godins
had a decision to make: either return to now-Communist Russia or stay in the
new Polish state, though without citizenship because they had not been born
there. No doubt finding comfort, community and a sense of safety amid the
hundreds of thousands of Jews in the Polish capital, they chose Pilsuldski over
Lenin. They lived in what would become the Warsaw Ghetto, on Nalewski
Street, where Samuel Godin eked out a living as a bookbinder.

My mother came to Zionism as a teenager, and it was easy to understand
why she, like so many of the other young Jews around her, was drawn to it. She
saw how hard her parents were struggling economically, on the refugee fringes
of a Jewish community itself precariously placed in a newly assertive Poland.
She saw no future for herself there. Though she attended a normal state-run high
school, she and her closest friends joined a Zionist youth group called Gordonia,
which had been founded in Poland barely a decade earlier. She started studying
Hebrew. Each summer, from the age of 13, she and her Gordonia friends would
spend deep in the Carpathian Mountains. They worked for local Polish
landowners, learning the rudiments of how to farm and the rigors of simple
physical labor. Late into the evening, they would learn not just about agriculture
but Jewish history, the land of Palestine, and how they hoped to put both their
new-found skills and the Zionist ideals into practice.

She had just turned 22 when she set off for Mishmar Hasharon with 60 other
Gordonia pioneers in the summer of 1935. It took them nearly a week to get
there. They travelled by train south through Poland, passing not far from the
little town of OSwiecim which would later become infamous as the site of the
Auschwitz concentration camp. Then, on through Hungary and across Romania

the fighting near Ismailia, at the northern end of the canal, as Arik Sharon’s
units pushed on after the crossing. The day before the end of the war, both
Amitai and Amiram Levin were part of an operation to take over the Fayid Air
Base across the canal. When an Egyptian RPG hit their Jeep, Amiram was
wounded. Amitai was killed.

I thought, too, of Yishai Izhar: the friend struck down beside me, who I’d
cradled in my arms on the top of my tank, trying to stop the bleeding.

“Oh Ehud,” Nava said. “It’s like 1967 all over again.”
“No,” I said. “Worse. Much worse.”

A few weeks later, | was coming out of the kirya when I ran into another
friend, whom I’d first met at Hebrew University. Like me, he had been a junior
officer in 1967. His name was Ron Ben-Ishai. He would go on to become a top
journalist, covering the military for Israel’s best-selling newspaper, Yediot
Achronot. In the early autumn of 1967, we were still transfixed by the idea of
being able to visit areas of biblical Israel, which for years had been under
Jordanian rule. With a few other friends who were young officers, nine of us in
all, Ron and I embarked on a trek from the southern edge of Jerusalem, weaving
our way through the Judaean Desert toward Kumeran, on the Dead Sea.

Now a very different war had come and gone. I’d fought in it. Ron, as what
is now called an embedded journalist, had been with Danny Matt’s paratroopers
when they’d crossed the canal. He was alongside another of Arik’s units
fighting out of the bridgehead on the far bank of the canal. That both of us had
seen terrible suffering over the past few weeks did not need saying. But Ron
said he wanted to show me something. Fishing into his wallet, he took out a
carefully folded photograph. He had taken it in 1967, just six years earlier, to
mark our Judaean trek. There we were. All nine of us. Young. Full of optimism.
And probably a bit full of ourselves as well.

Ron and I were the only two left alive.

We had won the war, and not just because our forces were now within 60
miles of Cairo, and only 25 from Damascus. We had been attacked by two huge

Details of the disturbing lifestyle led by Jeffrey Epstein emerged last night after the Daily Mail
uncovered logs of telephone messages left at his Florida child sex den.

Schoolchildren were among hundreds of callers who apparently rang to arrange massages for the
58-year-old billionaire friend of Prince Andrew, who was later convicted of child sex offences.

Ghislaine Maxwell, 49-year-old daughter of the disgraced media mogul Robert Maxwell, is named
in several messages.

Disturbing: Messages were found in Florida home of Jeffrey Epstein, left. The billionaire, 58, is a
friend of Prince Andrew, right

In one left for her or ‘Sarah’, a caller says she ‘doesn’t know at what time she must come this night
for the massage’.

Other messages for Epstein, the sources of which are not clear, contain such phrases as: ‘She has
females for Mr JE’ and ‘I have a female for him’.

Another with sickening overtones comes from someone called Jeanluc for Epstein: “He just did a

Johnny Depp. Harrison rolls his eyes and reluctantly introduces me to his friend Johnny Depp. I babel a

introduces me to the wives, Vanessa Paradis and Calista Flockhart. I bore them with girly chit-chat and
realize it's time to get out of there.

I head over to the CAA/Bryan Lourd Friday Night Party. Torrential rains and horrific winds cause a
traffic jam that makes it impossible to get near the house. Cell phones do not work. The world's most
famous faces cower under black umbrellas and make a run for it.

Saturday, February 26th, 2011

The sun comes up and dries up all the land. IAC chairmen and owner of The Newsweek/Daily Beast Barry
Diller and his designer wife Diane Von Furstenberg host their annual lunch for Graydon Carter in their
Coldwater Canyon home. Barry introduces me to his star guest, Governor Jerry Brown, just elected to his
third Cnonconsecutive) term as California Governor. Diane’s children, Alex and Tatiana, along with their
children comprise three generations of guests, which makes this party so special.

Like last year, enormous clear plastic tents are erected on the hill near the house. Long wooden picnic
tables covered with yellow flowers sit on oriental rugs, covering the soggy ground. Terrines of hot soup,
platters of sausages, fried chicken and salads are beautifully arranged on an endless buffet. Everyone
wears winter clothes; comfy sweaters and sensible shoes. I arrive in a fur coat.

Barry and Diane’s loyal friends have been coming to this party for over fifteen years. Everybody knows
everybody and it doesn’t matter if you have a hit film or TV show this season. Oprah winfrey kisses David
Geffen, casually chats with former Disney CEO Michael Eisner and current Sony chief Sir Howard Stringer.
Brett Ratner arrives with his house guest Jean Pigozzi who is allowed to photograph everyone. Graydon
greets people with wife Anna and Fran Lebowitz by his side.

Ingrid Sischy and Sandy Brant, Rupert Murdoch, Ron Meyer, Bryan Lourd Francesco Clemente with his twin
boys and Tom Ford chat each other up. People watching include the pregnant Victoria and David Beckham
with Lynn wyatt, Liv Tyler, Vincent Gallo, Eva Longoria, Larry Gagosian and Shala Monroque, Ben
Silverman, Debbie and Allen Grubman, Tobias Meyer and Mark Fletcher and Stephen Gaghan and Mini Mortimer
wearing her oversized cat glasses.

Bruce Cohen has invited me to the Oscar broadcast rehearsal. This is a special honor. There are metal
barricades leading up to the credentials trailer. High-tech security includes photos and computer
background checks. The only thing they don’t do is pat me down and ask for fingerprints. Once inside the
Kodak Theater’s massive auditorium, I find a seat next to Bruce’s proud parents. I watch Josh Brolin and
Javier Bardem come out in white dinner jackets and flub their lines as they pretend to present Best
Adapted Screenplay and Best Original Screenplay. Josh later told me at The Night Before Party that their
acting methods are completely opposite. Josh says he is a quick study and is very creative and
comfortable ad-libbing. Javier, whose mother tongue is Spanish, needs to have every syllable printed out,
which he studies with a dialect coach. Little wiggle room for jokes. Life size photos on large cardboard
plaques are taped to each nominee’s chair. I try to memorize their location, so when I return Sunday I
can quickly kiss them all.

and intentionally providing financial sup-
port to al Qaeda, given [the complaints’]
allegations that, prior to September 11, al
Qaeda and Osama bin Laden had _ pro-
claimed their intentions to commit murder-

26. Plaintiffs argue that Judge Robertson held
them to an unnecessarily stringent theory of
causation and submit that the D.C. Circuit’s
subsequent decision in Kilburn v. Socialist
People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 376 F.3d
1123 (D.C.Cir.2004), effectively overrules the
holding in Burnett IT. See Kilburn, 376 F.3d at
1129 (evaluating a claim under § 1605(a)(7)

causation was proximate cause). This Court
does not read Burnett IJ as requiring but-for

[21] Both Princes are alleged to have
tortiously aided and abetted terrorism
through their contributions to, and support
of, Islamic charities that they knew or

Additionally, Plaintiffs allege Prince Turki
aided and abetted the terrorists by at-
tempting to deflect their activities away
from Saudi Arabia and by serving as a
“facilitator of Osama bin Laden’s network
of charities.” Ashton Complaint 1261;
Burnett Complaint 1350. Plaintiffs allege
both Princes must have known that the
United States would have been al Qaeda’s
target, making the attacks on September
11 a foreseeable result of the Princes’ ac-

aiding and abetting are varieties of con-
certed action liability. Pittman v. Gray-
son, 149 F.8d 111, 122 (@d Cir.1998).
There must be “(1) an express or tacit
agreement to ‘participate in a common

presently support opposing sides in many of the Middle East’s major
confrontations, and are often seen as having radically divergent and
competing visions for the future of the region.

Which is why, in Lebanon — a country where the two powers wield
extensive influence over their respective allies — the news of a possible
rapprochement has already sparked confidence that political deadlock on a
number of key disputes may be resolved, perhaps even defying
expectations of a presidential vacuum by ushering in a successor to
President Michel Suleiman in time for the expiry of his term on 25 May.

“T [now] believe we will have an elected president on the 25th,” said MP
Ahmad Fatfat of the Saudi-supported Future Movement. “That [Prince
Faisal’s] invitation was public means they already agreed on many points
under the table. That means the negotiations regarding the new president
have already been done.”

Beyond the elections, Fatfat added the talks would likely also yield wider
benefits in terms of security and the economy. Earlier this week, Saudi
lifted what has been described as an “unofficial ban” on its citizens
traveling to Lebanon, fueling hopes of a boost to the country’s struggling
tourism industry. Saudi analysts concurred that the overall situation in
Lebanon would likely improve in the near future.

“T think in Lebanon there is already agreement [between Saudi and Iran],”
said Jamal Khashoggi, veteran Saudi journalist and former advisor to then-
ambassador Prince Turki al-Faisal. “The agreement in Lebanon is to
contain the situation.”

In neighboring Syria, however, where Iranian-backed regime forces
continue to suppress a Saudi-supported armed rebellion, Khashoggi
expects very little to materialize from Saudi-Iranian talks.

“I’m not optimistic,” he told NOW. “The Saudis and Iranians are still far
apart. The Iranians must relinquish their expansionism toward the
Mediterranean, or we have to give up Syria. And I don’t think we can
afford to give up Syria. And besides, even if we decide to give up Syria,
the Syrian people are not going to give up Syria.”

always looked forward to. It was my father who encouraged me, when I was
eight, to begin learning to play the piano. I took lessons once a week all during
my childhood along with several other of the kibbutz children. When we got old
enough, we took turns playing a short piece — the secular, kibbutz equivalent of
an opening prayer — at the Friday-night meal in the dining hall. I have always
cherished being able to play. Sitting down at the piano and immersing myself in
Tchaikovsky, Beethoven, Schubert or Mozart never ceases to bring me a sense
of calm, freedom and, especially nowadays, when I have finally worked to
master a particularly intricate piece, a feeling of pure joy.

As a young child, I spent most of my waking hours in the company of my
several dozen kibbutz “siblings” in the children’s home, the dining hall, or
running through the open spaces in the center of the kibbutz with our metapelet.
She would often take us through the orange groves in the afternoon, and
sometimes across the main road to the Arab village.

Wadi Khawaret consisted of a few dozen concrete homes built back from a
main street bordered by shops and storehouses. She would buy us sweets in the
little grocery store. The man behind the counter had a kindly, weathered face
and a dark moustache. Dressed in a gray galabiya and a keffiyeh, he smiled
when we came in. There was always a group of Palestinian women, in full-
length robes, seated on stoops outside breastfeeding their babies. We saw cattle,
bulls, even the odd buffalo, being led to or from the fields. I sensed no hostility,
and certainly no hatred, toward us in the village. The people seemed warm, and
benignly indifferent to the dozen Jewish toddlers and their metapelet. My own
attitude to Wadi Khawaret was of benign curiosity. I did not imagine that within
a couple of years we would be on opposite sides of a war. I enjoyed these visits,
as I enjoyed every part of my early childhood. Each age-group on the kibbutz
was given a name. Ours was called dror. It was the Hebrew word for
“freedom”.

But dror was also the name of one of the Jewish youth movements in the
Warsaw Ghetto, heroes in their doomed uprising against the Nazis. Little by
little, from about the age of five, I became more aware of the suffering the Jews
had so recently endured in the lands my parents had left behind, the growing

In fact, the campaign has gone much further than that. An American writer, well known for his extreme views,
was so keen to project Dubai’s alleged “failure” in the coexistence of cultures, that he went all the way stating

that Dubai was a place where cultures break up and not where cultures meet. He reached that conclusion based
on the fact that Dubai has jailed and deported a British couple caught having illegal sex on a public beach.

With regard to the fact that the global crisis effect threatens Dubai’s growth and economy, I can guarantee you
that those references constitute wishful thinking on the part of some people; they are illusions, not realities.
The economic foundations and development are firm and stable; otherwise Dubai would not have been able to
deal efficiently with the global financial crisis consequences. In addition to that, Dubai is not a city on its own.
It isa member of the United Arab Emirates federation, which 1s strong, resilient and successful — a federation
that is able to face the most difficult challenges.

Al Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi

Your Highness, the foreign media are reporting on the “bubble burst.” What would you
tell the people who are endorsing this view?

I keep hearing the expression of “the bubble” for the past couple of decades. In my opinion, this bubble is found
only in the minds of those who often keep repeating it and do not know its meaning. The future will prove to
them the truth.

Let me assure you we are fine, we have overcome the crisis with the least amount of losses. In our culture, we
say: be virtuous and you will gain. That is why we always look at the half full cup of water, and when we look
at the empty part, we do not moan over the void, instead we think of better and faster ways to fill it.

Al Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi

Your Highness, if we were saying this is an unfair campaign against Dubai then, could
you explain to us how to get out of the current crisis?

The impact of the global financial crisis has been felt all over the world. It generated a state of panic in all
developed economies. It was expected that our region would not be immune to the crisis, especially in view of
the fact that it led to the credit freeze, write-downs at banks, deferral of mutual credits, and a freeze on lending
in some of the wealthiest industrialized countries, such as the United States.

The crisis hit the world in September 2008, but I think that the panic pha se is over now, especially after the
intervention of governments in many major countries to regulate financial and banking sectors, and the
allocation of large sums of money to revitalize their economies. This step has enabled the summit of the G20
that was held in London a few days ago, to agree on a package of decisions and actions aimed to revive the
global economy and the organization of the international markets.

For us in the United Arab Emirates, I can safely say that we have succeeded in containing the risks of the global
financial crisis in record time. This is a result of the good policies of the Central Bank, and the government's
action to ensure the liquidity of banks and the protection of deposits, and other actions at the local level, such as
the additional liquidity that the Abu Dhabi government pumped it into the Emirate’s banks and the bond
issuance of $20 billion bonds.

The crisis management in addition to the decisions taken during the G20 summit have spread a high degree of

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012833.txt,"Earthquakes, viruses, chimpanzees, and some children often cause excessive harm to innocent
others, at least if the focus is on numbers and the way in which death arises. The earthquake that reached
a magnitude of 7.0 on the Richter scale and demolished the capital of Haiti in 2010 took the lives of
approximately 200,000 people, all innocent and undeserving of this natural disaster. This is excess
beyond what any psychopath has ever achieved. The Spanish Flu found its way into the bodies of
innocent people from the Arctic to the Pacific Islands from 1918 to 1920, and killed over 50 million
people — a death toll that is at least four times higher than what Hitler caused during his reign, and
comparable to that achieved by Mao Ze-Dong during his. As noted in chapter 1, chimpanzees kill at a
rate that approximates many hunter-gatherer groups. When they kill, the frenzied attacks are over the top,
involving gruesome dismemberment of their victims by biting into the face, ripping off testicles and
dislocating limbs. By the age of 15 years, Willie James Bosket Jr had committed some 200 armed
robberies, stabbed 25 innocent victims, kicked a boy off of a roof to his death, and killed two men
following a failed robbery, all “for the experience.” At the level of outcomes, these are all horrific cases
of lives lost, with some excessive in terms of numbers and others in terms of means.

We can eliminate earthquakes and other natural disasters from the list of evildoers by noting that
they don’t have, as their goal or as a foreseen consequence, the elimination of lives, innocent or not. They
don’t have goals at all. This also eliminates them from the class of victims, assuming the day comes when
scientists can kill off earthquakes, cyclones, hurricanes, blizzards and so on before they pick up enough
steam to cause great harm. One might think that viruses, and their virulent partners the parasites, lack
goals because they lack brains. This intuition is correct anatomically, but incorrect conceptually. As the
American philosopher Daniel Dennett has noted, the beauty of Darwin’s theory of natural selection is that
it provided a way of giving nature competence without comprehension. Thus, viruses and parasites have
goals without understanding at all. To survive and reproduce, they have evolved exquisite chemical and
electrical machines that harvest all of their host’s resources. And if making a living requires killing the
host, so be it. They do so without shedding a tear. No guilt, no remorse. Chimpanzees, on the other hand,
have goals and brains that represent them. When chimpanzees kill, their goal is not food. Their brutal
attacks are motivated by a desire to outcompete their rivals and absorb additional resources; no one
knows if they feel guilt or remorse. Willie Bosket’s goal was to rob two men, but when he failed, he
turned to gratuitous violence, for the experience. Bosket certainly could, as a human, feel guilt and
remorse, but all reports indicate he didn’t.

We can eliminate parasites and viruses from the list of evildoers and evilreceivers by noting that
they lack an understanding of right and wrong, and are incapable of suffering. Chimpanzees are a harder
case. They live in societies with norms and respond aggressively to norm transgressions, as occurs when a

high ranking male beats a lower ranking male for trying to steal food or a mating opportunity.

The U.Ss also had the ability to track Snowden’s movements via the cell phones of his
lawyers and other confederates after he surfaced. This tracking could all be done by the NSA.
What the U.S. lacked was any practical means to capture a high-profile intelligence defector in a
city that was part of China. By this time, US intelligence had established that Chinese and Hong
Kong security services were monitoring Snowden’s every move. This left few options in the
game for the U.S. “I’m not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29-year-old hacker,” President
Obama said on June 27, 2013.

The real prize, in any case, was not Snowden himself but the NSA’s secrets documents that he
had with him in Hong Kong. When Snowden was observed entering the Russian consulate, the
game was all but over. US diplomats could protest over back channels to Moscow, as they did,
but, with a trove of NSA secrets at stake, there was little expectation that they stop the Russians.
Two days later, the ’single point of failure,” as Snowden described himself, was on his way to
Russia, where he would be subject to Moscow’s rules.

When a victory is obtained in a major sports event, such as the world cup, it is celebrated with
victory dances, parties and ticker-tape parades. The opposite is true in the Game of Nation. An
intelligence victory involving secret documents, even if it cannot be entirely hidden, is kept veiled,
as far as is possible, to increase the value of the coup. “The final move in any sophisticated
intelligence game,” Angleton told me in relation to espionage intelligence coup, is “obscuring a
success.”

Following Angleton’s precept the Russian or Chinese intelligence services, if they had a role in
acquiring the product of the self-described “single point of failure,” would work to cover their
tracks in the affair even before the Aeroflot plane carrying Snowden touched down at
Sheremetyevo International Airport on June 23, 2013. If any false flag operations had been used
to trick, mislead, or otherwise induce Snowden to come to Hong Kong, they would be disbanded.
If any safe housed had been used to quarter Snowden in his first 11 days in Hong Kong, they
would be shut down. If any operatives had been used in Hawaii to guide or assist Snowden, they
would be put back into the sleep mode. If any tell-tale traces had been left in chat rooms or social
media, they would be systematically deleted. Even more important to the ultimate success of
such a communications intelligence coup, measures would be taken to conceal the extent of the
damage done by the “single point of failure” by not precipitously closing down compromised
sources. Snowden might believe that the power of the information he held was so great that, if
disclosed by him, all the NSA’s sources would immediately go dark in Russia and China, but
Russia might not wish to provide such clarity to its adversaries. An intelligence service need not
close down channels it discovers are compromised by an adversary. Instead it can elect to
continue to use them and furnish through them bits of sensitive information to advance its own
national interest. The real danger here was not that the NSA’s “lights” would dramatically be
extinguished but that all the future messages illuminated by those lights would be less reliable
sources of intelligence. The Game of Nations 1s, after all, merely a competition among
adversaries to gain advantages by the surreptitious exchange of both twisted and straight
information. When the NSA asserted in the summer of 2013 that over one million documents, it
was recognizing the most massive failure in its 60 year history. Not only NSA secrets, but secret
files from the CIA, the British GCHQ, and America’s cyber military commands, had been
compromised. It was, as Sir David Omand, the head of the British GCHQ described it, a huge,
strategic setback for the West. The genie could not be put back in the bottle as there is not a

intelligence service. When she traveled, she bought “burner” phones
locally and disposed of them before any calls could be traced back to
her. Upon arriving in Hong Kong, she avoided meeting Snowden
face-to-face out of concern about the surveillance of American intel-
ligence there. Instead, for thirteen days in Hong Kong she worked
through intermediaries. Her task was not only to arrange Snowden’s
escape route but also to create diversions to camouflage his real des-
tination. Under Assange’s tutelage, she had made deceptive ploys an
integral part of her tradecraft. “We were working very hard to lay as
many false trails as possible,” she later told an interviewer in Berlin.

According to Assange, she booked decoy flights for Snowden to
Beijing and New Delhi. She also used Snowden’s credit card number
to pay for the flight to India; because the card was blocked, she knew
there was a high probability that it would come to the attention of
USS. intelligence. According to Harrison, she booked no fewer than
a dozen such decoy tickets to confuse Snowden’s possible pursuers
in U.S. intelligence. The only actual ticket she bought for Snowden,
according to an Aeroflot official, was one to Moscow at the last min-

® ute. She bought a ticket for herself on the same flight, leaving on ©
June 23.

The source of the money for the Assange-Harrison operation is
unclear. Subsequently, Harrison said she was setting up secret bank
accounts to help organize such transborder escapes. Assange said she
was using “WikiLeaks’s resources.” Harrison said the “WikiLeaks
team” helped fund Snowden’s flight to Russia from Hong Kong, as
well as her own flight there. But WikiLeaks was not an organization
with spare cash in June 2013. Assange had forfeited his own bail by
fleeing to the embassy of Ecuador, offending many of his financial
supporters in Britain. He had also all but exhausted his bank account.
Aside from money that dribbled in from Poitras’s six-month-old
Freedom of the Press Foundation, the only steady source of funds
for WikiLeaks in 2013 was the previously mentioned payments
Assange received from the Russian government's RT television.

Mounting pressure was brought on the Hong Kong government
to take action against Snowden. On June 16, the U.S. government
informed the Hong Kong authorities that it had filed a criminal
complaint against Snowden and would be seeking his extradition.

Jeffrey, 
this may be a long shot to save the Boeing deal, or if you think its a dead deal, disregard this. 
I thought there was a connection between Tarek and myself, I do believe one concern was operation of Boeing with 
flight crew. I know its his problem not ours, but may help make the sale happen,. 
I wrote this email for your review, if you think its worth sending, please critique, and let me know,. thank you: 
Mr. Tarek El Sayed, 
I hope this email finds you well, and believe worth communicating my thoughts to you. 
I was surprised to hear that you decided against the purchase of our Super Boeing 727. I personally thought it was a great match 
for your business needs in Qatar. If for any reason your decision was based on crew issues and charter needs in the Middle East, 
I'd like to share some information that might prove beneficial to making you reconsider this purchase. 
The pilot candidates I have lined up for your interview along with the possibility of David Rodgers joining your flight department 
were as follows: 
(at no time did I disclose location or persons to the following pilot candidates to protect your privacy.) 
Robert Breslin, who is the former Chief Pilot of Mr. Donald Trump, Mr. Breslin flew the Boeing 727 and Boeing 757 owned by Mr 
Trump. Mr Breslin is a fine man of 40 years of age estimate, with extensive VIP Boeing operations. 
James Bartakowski, who has extensive flying experience in the Middle east, Africa and Europe regime. Mr. Bartakowski has also 
been involved in charter operations in Africa and Middle East and has contacted me on several recent occasions with charters for 
our Boeing 727, James has indicated there is the possibility of 40 — 60 hours per month charter operations for larger transport 
category aircraft in your area. I believe there is a growing need for charter in the business community in Qatar and neighboring 
countries. 
Bruce Jafahri, who is a current Boeing 727 captain who lived in Doha for two years, and familiar with international operations of 
Boeing 727 aircraft. Mr. Jafahri currently lives in California and ready for a new opportunity. Bruce is current in the Boeing 727 and 
also flew Captain on the Boeing 747. Well qualified individual and personable. 
Mr. El Sayed, as you have seen during our demo flight, our Boeing 727 is in impeccable condition, quite cabin and will provide 
many years of charter and business flights your company. I believe the large business jet future in Qatar is growing and you will be 
leading its path, and your initial investment in this purchase will not come close with other aircraft options on the market as you 
may have seen already. 
We are currently completing the C2C check on the Boeing, and as we have done in the past, assure you it will be a fine aircraft 
when it leaves Flight Star Maintenance repair facility. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 027097 
Sincerely, 
Lawrance Visoski 
Chief Pilot, JEGE Inc.

single tasking decision” approved by the FISA court. According to Rajesh De, just assembling
these reports involved thousands of hours of manpower. In addition, the President’s Oversight
Board required that NSA’s Office of the General Counsel and Inspector General supply it every
90 days with a list of every single error made by every NSA employee anywhere in the world
deviating from procedures, including even minor typing errors. These requirements, according to
De, inundated a large part of the NSA legal and executive staff in a sea of red tape. Yet, this
regulation could not undo surveillance programs such as the one Snowden revealed of Verizon
turning over the billing records of its custumers to the NSA, because the NSA was in compliance
with the FISA court order (even though, as it turned out in 2015, the FISA court may have erred
in interpreting the law.)

The NSA’s focus on surveillance may have led to the neglect of its second mission: protecting the
integrity of the channels through which the White House, government agencies and military units send
information. This task had been made vastly more difficult by the proliferation of computer networks,
texting and emails in the 21* century. To protect against cyber attacks against government networks, the
Pentagon belatedly created the Cyber Command in 2009. In it, the cyber defense units of the Army, Navy,
Marines, and Air Force cyber forces, were merged together in this new command put under the command
of the NSA director. NSA director Keith Alexander became the first director of this new command. One
problem for the Cyber command was separating attacks by civilians, including criminals, hacktavists and
anarchists, from cyber warfare sponsored and supported by adversary states. Since foreign intelligence
services often closely imitated the tools of civilian hackers, and were even known to provide them with
hacking tools. Even for the Cyber Command, it was not easy challenge to unambiguously determine if the
ultimate perpetrator of a cyber attacks was state-sponsored. For example, the identification of North Korea
as the principal actor behind the attack on Sony in December 2014 appeared to be a rare success, but many
cyber-security experts believed that it might be a false trail used to hide the real attacker. The problem
here was that clues can be fabricated in cyber space to point to the wrong party.

The job of the Cyber command was to prevent such an attack. To this end, it planted viruses on
hundreds of thousands of computers in private hands to act as sentinels to spot other suspicious viruses that
could mount such an attack. So private computers became a new battleground in the cyber was. It also
built a capability to retaliate. The problem was that, unlike incoming missiles, cyber attacks which were
launched through layers of other country’s computers could not be unambiguously traced back to the true
perpetrator.

This escalation by the Cyber Command set the stage for expanded forms of warfare in Cyber space.
“The Chinese are viewed as the source of a great many attacks on western infrastructure and just recently,
the U.S. electrical grid,” General Alexander said in explaining the need for this consolidation. “If that is
determined to be an organized attack, I would want to go and take down the source of those attacks.” The
same retaliation would presumably be used against Russia, Iran or any other adversary. Dominance of
cyber space itself now became part of the NSA’s mandate.

Even so, the most important job of the NSA remained intercepting secret information from
Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. To this end, it had an annual budget of $12.3 billion and
some 35,000 military and civilian employees. In 2012, James Clapper, Jr., the Director of

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011614.txt,"any other pursuing vehicle would be in no shape to follow for very long. But we
still had to avoid trouble on our way back out. I knew it would be a risk to go
back to the Coral Beach, so we took the shortest route to the sea, straight out to
the Corniche, the city’s main avenue along the Mediterranean. As we got closer,
we could hear gunfire. Obviously, the police, and the Palestinian militias,
realized something was not right. The advantage we had was that they would
have no idea what had happened on Rue Verdun, who we were, or where we
were going.

No sooner had we joined the Corniche than I saw another police Land Rover
about 200 yards ahead of us. This one had a spotlight on the roof, panning both
sides of the road. I told the driver to slow down. About 100 yards or so later,
reaching the place where we’d arranged for the SEALs to meet us, he and the
other station wagon pulled over to the side of the road. The Land Rover kept
driving. We slid down a steep embankment nearly 30 feet to the sea. Two of the
three assault teams had bags full of documents as well. We swam out to the
dinghies. When we had hoisted ourselves in, we headed out at first by paddle,
then under engine power, to the missile boat. The whole operation had taken
about a half an hour, only 10 minutes on Rue Verdun.

I radioed Manno on the way to the missile boat. A half-dozen words: the
agreed code phrase for “mission accomplished, targets achieved.” I could hear
relief in his voice when he replied. At first, | assumed that was because they
hadn’t heard from us during the operation. Our radio link to the missile boat had
gone down when we entered the built-up area around the apartment blocks.
Genuinely, despite Manno’s suspicion that I’d cut the connection. Yet he had
other reasons to exhale when he heard we had got out safely. Amnon’s team had
had a much tougher time. They met resistance from the moment they arrived at
the DFLP building. Two of his men were killed, another wounded. They set off
their explosive charges, but had to fight their way out. They only barely
managed to escape, carrying their fallen comrades with them and linking up
with another team of SEALs near the Coral Beach.

It was a little before six in the morning when I got home. I was careful not to
wake Nava. I’d changed out of my slacks and flats and surrendered my wig on
the missile boat. But I didn’t have the energy to deal with my makeup. The next
thing I remember was my wife standing by our bed as I stirred awake around
noon the next day. She looked at my eye makeup and lipstick, shook her head,
and smiled. She didn’t need to ask where I’d been. Israel radio had been full of
news about a major operation in Beirut.

2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *940

Based on this legislative history, Kenna concluded that crime victims have the right to speak at CVRA-covered proceedings.
445 Kenna explained that this interpretation advanced the purposes of the CVRA, for the statute was enacted to [*941] make
crime victims full participants in the criminal justice system.. 4° The Advisory Committee should follow that lead and
provide that victims are guaranteed a right to speak at sentencing. *47 Of course, in cases involving numerous victims (for

example, a massive fraud case), the CVRA itself allows courts to fashion a reasonable procedure” to accommodate the

competing concerns. #48

Rule 44.1 - Discretionary Appointment of Counsel for Victim The Proposals:
I proposed that the court's discretionary authority to appoimt counsel for a victim should be included in a new rule as follows:
Rule 44.1 Counsel for Victims.

When the interests of justice require, the court may appoint counsel for a victim to assist the victim in exercising his or her

rights. “49

The Advisory Committee did not propose any change in the Rules on this subject. 4°
Discussion:

The Advisory Committee never discussed this particular proposed change, so it is possible that its failure to adopt it was an
oversight. +5! In any event, here it is perhaps useful to emphasize just a few points in favor of this proposal.

While the CVRA does not create a right to counsel for victims, nothing in the Act deprived the courts of their preexisting
inherent authority. The courts generally have the right to appoint volunteer counsel in civil cases, *** a power that would seem
to extend to criminal cases. Indeed, the Supreme Court has left open the question of whether federal courts possess the inherent
authority to require counsel [*942] to provide legal services to the poor. ** The local rules of some federal courts already
explicitly recognize this power. *>4 In addition, Title 28 broadly permits the court in both civil and criminal cases to request
an attorney to represent any person unable to afford counsel. 49° And before Gideon v. Wainwright, *°° courts could request

45 Td.
46 Td.

47 Tn possible response to such concerns as I raise here, the Advisory Committee modified the Advisory Committee Note to this rule. See
infra notes 587-589 and accompanying text.

In fact, diverting from that story for a moment, my secretary, who
never went to college, insisted that her daughters go, so one of them
found herself in an art history course that she hated and complained
to her mother who in turn complained to me. Why does she have to
take art history? She is a business major (at Hofstra), for God’s sake,
said my secretary.

Obviously, I replied, there are art history professors who are wor-
ried that no one will take their course and they will be fired (tenure
doesn’t apply in that case as tenured faculty can be fired if their de-
partment is shut down), so they have lobbied successfully to require it.
She thought that was stupid and so do I. Now back to Northwestern.

Clearly the mathematics professors at Northwestern were simi-
larly concerned. Of course, they made their argument, the same way
the Hofstra art history professors did, one would assume, about these
courses being necessary for a liberal education, but the real argument
was about saving the department and everyone knew it.

But at Northwestern, this math argument had been made a long
time ago. What was new was that linguistics, at Northwestern, had
been classified as a math course! The reasons are clear enough. No one
was taking linguistics at Northwestern and the linguists were scared.
How they won the argument that linguistics was math (and thus an
alternative to the required math course) is anybody’s guess. Just re-
member that none of this is being done with the interests of the stu-
dents as the real agenda item.

If you believe, as universities do, that the most important thing
you can do as an administrator is recruit superstars to make your uni-
versity great, then there is a consequence to all this. The students suf-
fer. At first this seems an odd idea. How could a student be harmed by
recruiting a superstar? Well, it depends on the university.

At MIT, where students are different than they are at Northwestern
by quite a bit, there are a number of superstars that I know quite well.
Two of them, whom I will not name but are about as famous as a pro-
fessor can be, are people I have heard lecture many times. I have never
understood what they were talking about in any of those lectures. Now,
bear in mind that I know their fields very well so I should have been
able to understand them. Also, bear in mind that I was a terrible stu-
dent, which means my attention fades fast when I am bored or irritated.

Since I know these two men well enough, I can tell you that nei-
ther is particularly worried about being understood. They have been

the request for trees and (b) proved that the hedge that had been planted satisfactorily screened
the house and complied with the terms of the Agreement.

Grounds for Appeal

The action of ARCOM was inconsistent with and not in conformity with the provisions of the
Code and the Agreement which ARCOM and the Code Enforcement Board seek to enforce. The
grounds for appeal include the following:

1. ARCOM erroneously interpreted the Agreement to require not only a hedge as specified
by the Agreement, but to also require the planting of 20 trees behind the hedge. The
Agreement does not require any planting of trees.

2. ARCOM denied the request by Trump to reconsider its position that trees must be
planted.

3. ARCOM directed that the portion of the existing hedge which was undamaged, located
north of the driveway into the property, be partially or fully destroyed and replaced with
silver buttonwood hedge material for purposes of symmetry. Such a requirement is not
in conformity with the Agreement.

4. ARCOM abused its discretion in denying Appellant’s request since it is unreasonable to
require new and additional planting outside of the clearly limited requirements of the
Agreement.

5. Any action by the Code Enforcement Board or ARCOM with regard to the Agreement is
improper and inconsistent with the Town Code since the Code Enforcement Board can
only enforce Code provisions and not contractual agreements, notwithstanding any
language to the contrary in the Agreement.

Trump requests that this appeal be heard by the Town Council at the meeting on
August 11, 2008.

In addition, an independent basis for victims reviewing presentence reports is the victim's broad right under the CVRA to be

treated with fairness 4°? and right to restitution, as I argued in my earlier article. 4

Thus, the CVRA should be understood as giving victims the right to relevant information in the presentence report about the
Guidelines and to be heard before a court makes any final conclusions about Guidelines calculations and other sentencing
matters. Many states follow a similar approach and give victims access to presentence reports as part of the victim-impact
process. 404

Since I made my proposal, the Ninth Circuit has considered the question of whether to reverse a district court that declined to
provide the entire presentence report to a fraud victim. In an opinion containing only one substantive paragraph, the Ninth
Circuit affirmed the district court, which had rejected a victim's argument that the CVRA confers a general right for crime
victims to obtain [*933] disclosure of the [presentence report]. 405 The Ninth Circuit stated tersely that the district court did
not commit legal error. 40°

Although strong arguments can be made against Kenna, 4°” the case is not on point to my proposal. First, Kenna involved a
claim of a general right to access to the presentence report, apparently untethered to any particular need for access. My
amendment would be limited to situations where victims seek relevant contents of the presentence report to make a victim
impact statement at sentencing. Second, the victim in Kenna sought the entire presentence report. The Ninth Circuit pointedly
observed: We note that Kenna refused the district court's offer to consider disclosure of specific portions of the [presentence
report]. 4°8 My proposal tracks what the district court offered to Kenna - that a victim would have access to relevant contents
of the presentence report.

Because victims have a right of access to relevant parts of the presentence report, the question then arises of how to provide
that access. In my earlier article, I recommended the simplest solution to the competing concerns would be to disclose the
report, upon request, to victims through the prosecutor. The prosecutor could filter out irrelevant confidential information and
assist the victim by highlighting critical parts of the report. It might be objected that this approach would burden prosecutors.

Judge denies gag order in Epstein, Edwards lawsuit; dismisses complaint
By MICHELE DARGAN
DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER
Updated: 7:25 p.m. Wednesday, July 13, 2011
Posted: 7:11 p.m. Wednesday, July 13, 2011
A circuit judge Wednesday squashed an attempt by attorneys for Jeffrey Epstein to prevent parties in a civil lawsuit
involving the billionaire sex offender from talking to the media.
Circuit Judge David Crow denied the motion for a gag order.
In addition, Crow dismissed the complaint by Epstein against attorney Brad Edwards, who has represented 10 underage
girls in sex abuse claims brought against Epstein. Epstein alleged Edwards abused the court system by threatening to
depose Epstein’s powerful friends, which included Donald Trump and President Bill Clinton.
Other claims included that Edwards tried to obtain records from an alleged sex therapist who had never treated Epstein
and that Edwards used investigative tools that included trespassing on Epstein’s property.
Crow gave Epstein’s attorneys 30 days to refile the lawsuit, which will be the second amended complaint and third
evolution of the lawsuit.
Epstein also named Edwards’ former boss, convicted Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein, in the lawsuit, alleging Rothstein
made “various representations to potential investors regarding the Epstein actions.”
In dismissing the lawsuit, Crow said he found “serious problems” with the complaint. Crow called the lawsuit “vague.
“You have to know, at this point in time, what he did or didn’t do that was an abuse of process,” Crow said.
Epstein, 58, has confidentially settled more than two dozen lawsuits with young women who allege they were sexually
abused by him when they were minors.
Edwards filed a counterclaim, alleging Epstein filed the lawsuit to get Edwards to back down from representing the
victims.
“Mr. Epstein had to pay more to settle these cases than he would have if Mr. Edwards wasn’t out there putting all this
pressure on him,” said attorney Jack Scarola, who represents Edwards. “That’s Mr. Edwards’ job ... to put as much
legitimate pressure on the defendant as he possibly could and he obviously did an extremely effective job.”
Epstein pleaded guilty to two felony charges: soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor for prostitution. He served 13
months in the county jail and has to register as a lifelong sex offender.
Representing Epstein, attorney Joseph Ackerman argued unsuccessfully for a gag order. Ackerman said Scarola has
repeatedly made statements to several news organizations about the case.
“Mr. Scarola has constantly referred to Mr. Epstein as a pedophile and there’s been no proof of that anywhere,”
Ackerman said. “Muzzling lawyers who may wish to make public statements has been long recognized as within the
court’s inherent power ... We don’t believe it’s appropriate to wage a media campaign and taint the jury pool.”
Scarola said it would be unconstitutional to impose a gag order.
“There is a complete and total absence of proof that we have engaged in any conduct whatsoever that could be
prohibited,” Scarola said.
Scarola said he and Edwards have been asked to appear on national television as well as received interview requests
from the foreign press. Scarola said he has been selective in his interviews.
There has been a frenzy in the British press ever since Virginia Roberts, an Epstein victim, spoke to the Sunday Daily
Mail earlier this year about being introduced to Prince Andrew and spending time with him at Epstein’s behest. Roberts
alleged she served as a sex slave to Epstein when she was a minor.
“If Mr. Epstein is embarrassed by Mr. Epstein’s conduct, that’s Mr. Epstein’s problem,” Scarola said.
“I’m pleased to hear he’s embarrassed by his conduct. Maybe it will serve as some deterrent in the future.”

It was a hot day at the chess tournament in Phoenix, Arizona—103
degrees, to be exact—and 14-year-old Nathaniel Dight was elated over his
custom-made chess set. Those carved wooden pieces had been weighted
precisely for the smooth moves he liked to make. Each one had been
lacquered and, for this extreme heat, carefully protected by matte acrylic

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026589.txt,"Another relatively recent variance from the treatment of DREs as “tax nothings” can be found in
the Section 752 regulations, which deal with the allocation of partner-level tax basis arising from
partnership-level debt. Under these complex rules, partnership debt is generally allocated to the
partner or partners, if any, that bear the ultimate “economic risk of loss” for the debt. For
example, where a partnership debt is guaranteed by a partner, that partner generally would be
allocated the debt's entire associated tax basis. In determining which partner bears the economic
risk of loss, the rules provide a general assumption that a partner is financially able to perform
under any guarantee agreement irrespective of the partner's actual net worth, unless the facts
and circumstances indicate a plan to circumvent or avoid the obligation. =* As a result, tax
planners were able to insert virtually valueless DREs as guarantors of partnership debt to secure
the associated debt basis for use by the ultimate owners of the entities.

Final regulations published on 10/11/06 significantly modified this approach for all partners
holding partnership interests through a DRE. == Under Reg. 1.752-2(k)(1), where a partner holds
his partnership interest through a DRE, the DRE's obligations are taken into account when
determining the partner's economic risk of loss for the partnership-level liability only to the
extent of the net value of the DRE as of the date on which the partnership determines the
partner's share of partnership liabilities. 22 In the event that one or more DREs have payment
obligations with respect to one or more liabilities of a partnership, the partnership must allocate
the net value of each DRE among the liabilities in a reasonable and consistent manner, taking
into account the relative priorities of those liabilities. °7

This special treatment of DREs in this context has been criticized by some commentators in that
it uniquely singles out DREs when, in fact, any pass-through entity that limits the liability of its
owners can be used to accomplish similar results without a similar net value limitation. 22
Nonetheless, the special treatment exists and represents another danger in simply ignoring a
DRE as nonexistent during the course of tax planning.

State Tax Treatment of DREs.

Despite the fact that almost every state generally respects the federal classification of an SMLLC
as a DRE for income tax purposes, several states impose an entity-level tax or fee on LLCs,
including SMLLCs. °° The types of taxes or fees imposed, and the SMLLCs subject to the tax, vary
widely from state-to-state. Practitioners should inquire into a state's entity-level tax on SMLLCs,
and possibly other DREs, before proceeding with planning opportunities in that state.

Unlike the general conformity with federal law classification for income tax purposes, most states
treat LLCs, including SMLLCs, as separate legal entities with respect to registration fees, sales
and use taxes, employment taxes, and property taxes. As a result, LLCs are generally subject to
liability for these taxes and fees. Additionally, most states require an SMLLC to file its own
separate sales and use tax return, notwithstanding the fact that for state income tax purposes
the SMLLC is disregarded. °° On the other hand, many states allow an SMLLC and its owner to
elect to file a consolidated sales and use tax return, if certain conditions are met. %
Consequently, practitioners should analyze a DRE's tax and filing obligations state by state, so
that they can fully apprise their clients of all potential taxes and fees a particular state may
impose,

Grantor Trust Considerations

As mentioned briefly above, opinions differ as to whether a wholly grantor trust is considered a
disregarded entity. In Rothstein, © the Second Circuit Court of Appeals implicitly held that a
wholly grantor trust was not disregarded for all income tax purposes, because the grantor
received a cost basis for assets purchased from the trust. In Rev. Rul. 85-13, 1985-1 CB 184,

politicians. Like many other countries, Chinese entities employ prominent lobbying
and public relations firms and cooperate with influential civil society groups. These
activities complement China’s long-standing support of visits to China by members
of Congress and their staffs. In some rare instances China has used private citizens
and/or companies to exploit loopholes in US regulations that prohibit direct foreign
contributions to elections.

e On university campuses, Confucius Institutes (CIs) provide the Chinese government
access to US student bodies. Because CIs have had positive value in exposing students
and communities to Chinese language and culture, the report does not generally oppose
them. But it does recommend that more rigorous university oversight and standards
of academic freedom and transparency be exercised over CIs. With the direct support
of the Chinese embassy and consulates, Chinese Students and Scholars Associations
(CSSAs) sometimes report on and compromise the academic freedom of other Chinese
students and American faculty on American campuses. American universities that host
events deemed politically offensive by the Chinese Communist Party and government
have been subject to increasing pressure, and sometimes even to retaliation, by
diplomats in the Chinese embassy and its six consulates as well as by CSSA branches.
Although the United States is open to Chinese scholars studying American politics or
history, China restricts access to American scholars and researchers seeking to study
politically sensitive areas of China’s political system, society, and history in country.

e At think tanks, researchers, scholars, and other staffers report regular attempts by
Chinese diplomats and other intermediaries to influence their activities within the
United States. At the same time that China has begun to establish its own network
of think tanks in the United States, it has been constraining the number and scale of
American think tanks operations in China. It also restricts the access to China and to
Chinese officials of American think-tank researchers and delegations.

e In business, China often uses its companies to advance strategic objectives abroad,
gaining political influence and access to critical infrastructure and technology. China
has made foreign companies’ continued access to its domestic market conditional on
their compliance with Beijing’s stance on Taiwan and Tibet. This report documents
how China has supported the formation of dozens of local Chinese chambers of
commerce in the United States that appear to have ties to the Chinese government.

e In the American media, China has all but eliminated the plethora of independent
Chinese-language media outlets that once served Chinese American communities. It
has co-opted existing Chinese-language outlets and established its own new outlets.
State-owned Chinese media companies have also established a significant foothold

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011600.txt,"“Tell Motta we know about it,” I said. “We’ve planned for it. It’s not a
problem.” I figured there were at most four or five Lebanese soldiers manning
the checkpoint. The last thing they’d want to do is get involved in a firefight
between us and the Syrians. But Motta’s reply was unequivocal. The mission
was off.

When we’d climbed through a bramble-filled ravine back into Israel, I left a
message for Motta. I found it hard to disguise my frustration, and my anger, at
being ordered to abort the attack, especially after my assurances that the
Lebanese roadblock was not a problem. Yet when we got back to the sayeret
base, I realized there was more to his veto than I’d thought. He and Dado had
received intelligence saying the Syrians were likely to make a series of further
inspection tours of the border area, so this would not be our last chance. The
next day, we received word they’d be touring the western part of the border on
June 13. On the Lebanese side, it was known as Ras Naqoura, on ours as Rosh
Hanirkra, where the Mediterranean coastline rose dramatically to a ridge and,
once into Israel, sloped steeply down again toward Haifa.

I took in two main assault teams, one led by Mookie, the other by Uzi
Dayan. We hid in a tangle of bushes about halfway along the road which
climbed up toward the border ridge. I stationed Bibi and his team at the bottom
of the road, equipped with Uzis and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. We
waited, knowing that we’d be able to see the convoy as it twisted its way up
toward us. Again, I had no direct link to Motta. Yet both he and Dado were
following the mission from a command post in northern Israel. We were in
nearly real-time contact through a sayeret officer, named Amit Ben-Horn, right
across the border.

A first vehicle appeared at around 10:30 in the morning. Bibi radioed us. It
was a Lebanese army armored car with a single machine-gun. It drove past and
halted 150 feet on, at the point where the road began to climb. The two guys
inside took out a small table and a couple of chairs and began brewing up coffee
on the side of the road. “All OK,” I said when I radioed Amit to tell him. “Pre-
deployment.” The convoy arrived two hours later and began to climb. “We’re
taking it,” I radioed Amit.

“Wait,” he replied. And as I kept pressing him for the final go-ahead, another
30 seconds passed.

“Not approved,” he finally barked back at me, clearly wanting to make sure I
got the message.

Iln 2009, Barack Obama had an

respected and admired by the Israelis, 
because he did not come from the same

Palm Beach Post Editorial #1 
He was over 50. And they were girls 
By Elisa Cramer 
HASH(Ox5fa474) 
Friday, August 04, 2006 
If the women whom Palm Beach police say a part-time town resident invited to his home 
and paid for sex acts were, in fact, women, the solicitation charge against Jeffrey Epstein 
might feel more sufficient. But, according to police records, they weren't. He was over 
50. And they were girls. 14. 15.16.17-year-old girls. That should count for something - 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030299 
the difference between prostitution and pedophilia. 
So, it is baffling that Mr. Epstein, who was indicted last month by a grand jury on one 
felony count of solicitation of prostitution, has not been charged, as Palm Beach police 
strenuously urged, with unlawful sex acts with a minor and lewd and lascivious 
molestation. 
Conviction of crimes against minors would mean steeper penalties than the maximum 
five-year prison term Mr. Epstein faces if convicted of the single count of felony 
solicitation. It also would help carry a message of intolerance to perverts who prey on 
girls. 
Prosecutors did not pursue charges against Mr. Epstein reflecting the age of the victims 
because they assumed a jury would view the girls not as victims but as promiscuous, 
untrustworthy, willing participants. The presumption is offensive. 
Mr. Epstein, a 53-year-old Manhattan money manager who has hired Harvard law 
professor Alan Dershowitz and defense attorney Jack Goldberger, has denied knowing 
how old the girls were. But police interviews with five alleged victims and 17 witnesses 
under oath, as well as phone messages, a high school transcript and other items that 
police found from searching Mr. Epstein's trash and 7,234-square-foot waterfront home, 
provide evidence that he knew the girls were teenagers. 
One girl couldn't show up when Mr. Epstein wanted because she had soccer. Another 
time, Mr. Epstein had to wait for his massage session because the girl he wanted was 
still in class. 
Why didn't State Attorney Barry Krischer let a jury decide whether to believe the 
teenagers - including a 16-year-old who went to Mr. Epstein's house to work in 
December 2004 after being asked whether she needed to make money for Christmas 
gifts? 
Prosecutors gave greater weight to the details Mr. Dershowitz provided about the girls in 
an apparent effort to assail their character. Mr. Dershowitz pointed out to prosecutors that 
some of the teenagers had talked on myspace.com about marijuana and alcohol use. 
The 20-year-old Royal Palm Beach woman who told police she recruited girls for Mr. 
Epstein has a Web page on myspace.com that features one girl using the name Pimpin' 
Made EZ. 
Although no charges of witness tampering have been filed, the parents of at least one of 
the teenage victims complained to police of being followed and intimidated by two men. 
Police determined that their vehicles were registered to two private investigators. Mr. 
Goldberger denied knowing anything about it. 
Police also note in their reports that the state attorneys office offered Mr. Epstein a plea 
deal that would have placed him on probation for five years, allowing him ultimately to 
walk away with no criminal record at all. 
I asked Mr. Krischer's spokesman, Mike Edmondson, why the case was referred to a 
grand jury instead of Mr. Epstein being charged and facing a trial before a jury. And 
shouldn't the victims credibility be a factor to determine whether a crime's been 
committed, not whether a jury will convict? (After all, as Mr. Goldberger told The Palm 
Beach Post of Mr. Epstein, He's never denied girls came to the house.) 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030300 
Especially, I asked Mr. Edmondson to explain: Why shouldn't the public look at this case 
and think there are two kinds of justice - one for the wealthy and one for the rest of us? 
Mr. Edmondson said he could not comment on the case because it is active, but on the 
latter point, he offered, for the sake of philosophical debate: Whether wealth buys a 
different standard of justice across the country ... the answer to that would, of course, be 
yes. 
But in this case, he said, regardless of the battery of attorneys, the outcome would be the 
same. Every issue that was debated in public was debated in our office before this case 
went to the grand jury. 
In this case, it is not the victims credibility but the state attorneys that deserves 
questioning. 
Palm Beach Post Editorial #2 
Massaging the system 
Palm Beach Post Editorial 
Thursday, August 10, 2006 
Palm Beach police say their 11-month investigation shows that 53-year-old part-time 
town resident Jeffrey Epstein committed unlawful sex acts with and lewd and lascivious 
molestation on five underage girls. Defense attorney Jack Goldberger claims that his 
client, Jeffrey Epstein, had no idea that the untrained girls he hired for massages were 
minors. 
The Palm Beach Count State Attorneys Office could have let a jury decide whom to 
believe. Instead, State Attorney Barry Krischer left the public to wonder whether the 
system tilted in favor of a wealthy, well-connected alleged perpetrator and against very 
young girls who are alleged victims of sex crimes. 
Mr. Krischer took the unusual step of referring the case to a grand jury, which last month 
indicted Jeffrey Epstein on one felony count of solicitation of prostitution. That decision 
came after Harvard law Professor Alan Dershowitz met with prosecutors to undermine 
the credibility of the 14- to 17-yearold girls who charged that Mr. Epstein had paid them 
$200 to $300 to undress and massage him in his five-bedroom, 7 1/2 -bath home on the 
Intracoastal Waterway. 
The girls, Mr. Dershowitz told prosecutors, had written on myspace.com about smoking 
marijuana and drinking alcohol. But if the girls have a credibility problem, what about 
Jeffrey Epstein? Mr. Goldberger, told The Post: Mr. Epstein absolutely insisted anybody 
who came to his house be over the age of 18. How he verified that, I don't know. And 
prosecutors took him at his word? 
Police collected evidence that refutes Jeffrey Epstein's defense. Police searched his home 
and garbage and found phone messages about the girls' school schedules and even a high 
school transcript, suggesting that Mr. Epstein at least knew that the girls were teenagers. 
The state attorneys office has responded to criticism from Palm Beach police and others 
by noting the higher standard prosecutors face for conviction than law-enforcement 
officers do for arrest. But in this case, the state attorney bowed to the risk that a jury 
might look at both Jeffrey Epstein and the girls, and point fingers at both sides. 
Even if the girls could be impugned as prostitutes, solicitation of a minor is a crime. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030301 
Former disc jockey and teacher Bruno Moore was charged with that Tuesday. 
Investigators say the 34-year-old used the Internet - myspace.com - to recruit a 13-year 
old. 
Police say Jeffrey Epstein used a 20-year-old woman who had a myspace.com  
account to recruit young girls. His actions were sleazy. It would have been good to ask a 
jury just how criminal they were. 
Palm Beach Post Editorial #3 
Spare us the outrage 
Wednesday, February 13, 2008 
An 11-month police investigation led to an indictment on one felony charge of 
solicitation of prostitution. That was in July 2006, and part-time Palm Beacher 
Jeffrey Epstein still has faced no repercussions for allegedly preying on underage 
girls. 
So maybe Mr. Epstein is satisfied that he's getting his moneys worth from his large 
legal team, which includes Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz 
(remember O.J. Simpson?) and Kenneth Starr (remember Monica Lewinsky?). Jack 
Goldberger of West Palm Beach, who's also on the team, told Post columnist Jose 
Lambiet in November: This case is absolutely going to end without a trial within 
the next two months. 
He was wrong, but Mr. Goldberger remains on Mr. Epstein's payroll, feigning 
moral outrage at two lawsuits filed this year against the Manhattan money 
manager. The lawsuits allege sexual exploitation of teenaged girls, one of 
them as young as 14. Said Mr. Goldberger after the first lawsuit, seeking 
more than $50 million, was filed on Jan. 24: We think this shows what this 
case is all about: money. Yes, it is - Mr. Epstein's effort to buy his way out 
of prosecution. 
According to the lawyer of a 17-year-old whose parents are suing him, Mr. Epstein 
masturbated in front of her (she was 14 at the time) and used a vibrator on her at his 
home in February 2005. Another Epstein attorney, Lilly Ann Sanchez dismissed it: 
Jeffrey Epstein did not have sex with this woman. 
For those girls who claim that he did, Mr. Epstein's lawyers maintain that he did not 
know their ages, despite a police search of his home and garbage that found phone 
messages about the girls school schedules and even a high school transcript. For all of 
his money, Mr. Epstein's best defense remains I didn't know that I was a criminal 
pervert? 
Palm Beach Post Editorial #4 
Rich man fought the law and he mostly won 
Palm Beach Post Editorial 
Monday, July 07, 2008 
Two years after a grand jury indicted him on a felony charge of solicitation of 
prostitution, Jeffrey Epstein finally admitted that he lured a teenage girl to his $8.5 
million, 13,000-square-foot Palm Beach mansion for sex. A week ago, the 55-yearold 
investment banker began serving 18 months in jail. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030302 
But that plea deal - guilty of felony solicitation of prostitution and procuring a 
person under the age of 18 for prostitution - does not account for all five of the girls, 
one as young as 14, who alleged that Epstein sexually abused them. And why is Epstein 
serving his term in the overcrowded Palm Beach County Jail and not a state prison, where 
inmates are sent if their sentences are longer than one year? 
The slow, dissatisfying resolution of the case sends a message to the public 
Post your that there's a different system of justice for the wealthy who hire highcomments 
powered lawyers. Epstein's legal team included West Palm Beach defense 
on this attorney Jack Goldberger, Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz, 
who defended O.J. Simpson against murder charges, and Kenneth Starr, the 
prosecutor who pursued then-President Bill Clinton for lying about sex with 
young women. 
Palm Beach police spent 11 months investigating Epstein before State Attorney Barry 
Krischer sent the case to a grand jury, instead of charging Epstein so the man who once 
boasted of accepting only billionaire clients could face a trial. The police had taken a high 
school transcript, class schedules and phone messages from Epstein's home that showed 
he knew the girls were underage. Yet Mr. Krischer was more swayed by Epstein's 
lawyers, who attempted to impugn the girls character by showing they had chatted on 
myspace.com about smoking marijuana and drinking. He should have let a jury decide 
whether the victims - and Epstein - were credible. 
Ultimately, one charge against Epstein finally reflected the age of one victim, and the 
plea agreement left Epstein labeled a sex offender. With that additional charge, if Epstein 
had been convicted at a trial, he could have been sentenced to anything from probation to 
15 years in prison, Assistant State Attorney Lanna Belohlavek said, adding that the 
recommended guideline sentence was 21 months. 
Epstein also won't have to certify to the court that he is receiving counseling, typically 
required of sex offenders, because he has a private psychiatrist. But without court 
supervision, who will ensure Epstein is in fact being treated? 
The plea deal also drops a federal investigation of Epstein. If a federal investigation was 
warranted, how does dropping it before completion benefit the public? 
Epstein preyed on girls and denied it. For three years, his wealth and the influence of his 
lawyers bought him the protection the state attorney owed to the victims.

IT looks like New York billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein got off easy when he was hit 
with a charge of soliciting a prostitute for a happy ending in Palm Beach. 
Because if Palm Beach police had their way, Epstein, 53 - who surrendered last Sunday 
and is out on $3,000 bail - might have been whacked with far more serious charges of 
paying underage girls for sex. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030303 
But a state grand jury found the witnesses in the case were not credible and threw out all 
but the single charge of soliciting a hooker in his luxurious Palm Beach home. Epstein's 
lawyers and friends now say he's the hapless victim of a vendetta by Palm Beach Police 
Chief Michael Reiter, whom they describe as a born-again nut case. 
According to the police investigation, a copy of which was obtained by the Palm Beach 
Post, detectives took statements from 17 witnesses and five alleged victims. Haley 
Robson, 20, a Palm Beach Community College student who described herself as like a 
Heidi Fleiss, says she got naked to give Epstein a massage, then brought him six girls 
ages 14-16 for massages and sex at his home. She said they were paid $200 per session. 
Cops also allege that Epstein's personal assistant, Sarah Kellen, who hasn't been charged, 
set up the liaisons and put fresh sheets on the massage table and supplied massage oils. 
Police searched through Epstein's garbage and retrieved sex toys and feminine hygiene 
products. 
Epstein's Palm Beach lawyer, Jack Goldberger, told Page Six that the Florida state 
attorney concluded the cops had looked at evidence from a one-sided perspective. He 
added that Epstein had passed an extensive lie-detector test in which he was grilled about 
underage girls. 
Epstein's New York lawyer, Gerald Lefcourt, said, The prosecutor didn't want to bring 
any charges in this case, but because of the craziness of this police chief, we have the 
charge of solicitation. 
Last night, WPTV in Palm Beach reported that one reason Robson's testimony may have 
been dismissed is the kinky Web page she has on MySpace featuring photos of her 
female friends playing with sex toys. One friend even uses the name Pimpin Made EZ. 
Robson, who isn't charged, also writes, Do what you do to make that money, life is 
a gamble. Stay hustling. 
A spokeswoman for Reiter said, We think our investigation speaks for itself

NewYork Post — 09/20/2007 
JAIL LOOMS FOR SEX-CASE MOGUL 
September 20, 2007 -- THE sordid sex case involving Jeffrey Epstein may 
be coming to an unhappy ending -with a plea deal that would put the 
publicity-shy billionaire behind bars for 15 months for allegedly soliciting 
underage teen girls for sex at his Palm Beach mansion. 
Sources tell Page Six that Epstein's high-powered lawyers - including Alan 
Dershowitz, Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black and Kenneth Starr - have been 
negotiating a deal with federal prosecutors who are probing, among other 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030304 
things, whether the gray-haired money manager paid West Palm Beach girls 
for sex or transported them across state lines. Epstein is currently charged by 
the State of Florida with soliciting young prostitutes for sex - but federal 
charges would be far more serious. 
The Palm Beach Post reported yesterday that Epstein is very close to a deal 
with the feds that would send him to jail for 11/2 to 2 years. Sources tell us that 
while a deal has not yet solidified, what's under discussion is a guilty plea to 
at least one charge in exchange for a sentence of 15 months in a Florida state 
prison, followed by 15 months of home confinement. That would be a fraction 
of the time he would have to serve if he were to be convicted by a jury. 
Epstein's spokesman, Howard Rubenstein, said his client would have no 
comment. Dershowitz also declined to comment late yesterday. 
Palm Beach police records show that on March 15, 2005, a 14-year-old girl 
alleged she had visited Epstein's estate, where she partially stripped and 
gave him a massage during which he pulled out a purple vibrator and used it 
on her in exchange for $300. A further probe uncovered five young women 
who said Epstein had masturbated and touched their genitals during 
massages, the records state. A woman named Haley Robson - who 
described herself as like a Heidi Fleiss - later admitted bringing six girls 
between the ages of 14 and 16 to Epstein's house, according to cops. 
Despite the allegations, Epstein was only nailed on a single charge of 
soliciting a hooker - but it sparked a federal probe. Epstein's lawyers and 
friends have insisted he was the hapless victim of a vendetta by Palm Beach 
Police Chief Michael Reiter, whom they described as a born-again nutcase. 
Palm Beach Post - 08/14/ 2006 
Police chiefs reputation helps discredit attacks 
By Larry Keller 
Palm Beach Post - Monday, August 14, 2006 
In the case of Palm Beach financier Jeffrey Epstein, it seems, at times, as if two men are 
accused of wrongdoing: Epstein and Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter. 
Epstein, 53, was indicted last month on a charge of felony solicitation of prostitution 
solely because of Reiter's craziness, one of Epstein's lawyers said. His department 
disseminated a distorted view of the case and behaved in a childish manner when the 
grand jury didn't indict Epstein on the charges it sought, another Epstein lawyer 
complained. 
To hear the Epstein camp tell it, Reiter, 48, is a loose cannon better suited to be the 
sheriff of Mayberry. They whisper that he's embroiled in a messy divorce. 
Reiter did in fact file for divorce from his wife, (NAME REMOVED), last year, after 24 
years of marriage. They have a son, 18, and a daughter, 14. The couple is scheduled to go 
to mediation next week, Aug. 16. Nothing in the court file suggests their split is 
particularly ugly. 
Reiter incurred the wrath of the Epstein camp as well as the state attorneys office for two 
reasons. First, he pressed for Epstein to be charged with the more serious crimes of 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030305 
sexual activity with minors. Second, he slammed State Attorney Barry Krischer in blunt 
language seldom used by one law-enforcement official concerning another because of 
what he perceived as that office's mishandling of the case. 
In a letter to Krischer written May 1, Reiter called his actions in the Epstein case highly 
unusual. He added, I must urge you to... consider if good and sufficient reason exists to 
require your disqualification from the prosecution of these cases. In short, Reiter told 
the county's top prosecutor for the past 13 years that he ought to get off the case. It 
looks like a departure from professionalism, Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine 
Fernandez Rundle said of Reiter's letter. 
Following Epstein's indictment, Reiter referred the case to the FBI to determine whether 
the super-rich, super-connected defendant had violated any federal laws. Reiter won't 
discuss the case or the broadsides aimed at him. But others almost uniformly use one 
word to describe the chief: professional. 
I have always been impressed by Mike's professionalism and his leadership, said Rick 
Lincoln, chief of the Lantana Police Department and a Palm Beach County cop for 32 
years. The town of Palm Beach has a very professional police department. We all 
consider Mike to be our peer and a man of integrity. Juno Beach Police Chief H.C. 
Clark II agreed. Although he doesn't know Reiter well, he has met with him on 
countywide law enforcement issues. I've never seen him lose his cool. I've never seen 
anything but a professional demeanor from him. 
Reiter joined the Palm Beach Police Department in 1981, leaving a $20,000-a-year patrol 
job at the University of Pittsburgh. His personnel jacket shows consistently excellent job 
evaluations. Posh Palm Beach is no hotbed of crime, and in his first year on the job, a 
resident confined to his home with a sick child thanked Reiter for delivering a few Cokes 
to the house. Reiter refused payment for the beverages. Another resident thanked Reiter 
for shutting off his car's headlights in his driveway, saying a valet must have been at 
fault. Reiter worked everything from road patrol to organized crime, vice and narcotics. 
And he's no novice at investigations involving the island's rich and famous. He was the 
lead detective probing the drug overdose death of David Kennedy in 1984. He also was 
one of the officers who worked the investigation of William Kennedy Smith, who was 
charged in 1991 — and later acquitted — with raping a woman at the Kennedy family 
compound in Palm Beach. 
Reiter, who has a master's degree in human resource development from Palm Beach 
Atlantic University, also has attended the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Va., and 
management courses at Harvard. He's been active in countywide interagency law 
enforcement organizations and has a top secret national security clearance. 
He has a perspective that's broader than just addressing the needs of the town, said 
Town Manager Peter 
Elwell, who promoted Reiter from assistant chief to chief in March 2001. Reiter makes 
more than $144,000 as the town's top cop. Elwell thinks he's worth it. He's very 
businesslike, very straightforward. He's not easily agitated or flamboyant. He's about the 
work, Elwell said. I think that his service as chief has been outstanding in five-plus 
years.

New York Times — 09/03/2006 
Questions of Preferential Treatment Are Raised in Sex Case Against Money Manager - 
September 3, 2006 
By ABBY GOODNOUGH 
PALM BEACH, Fla. — In the summer and autumn of last year, when most of the 
mansions here stood empty behind their towering hedges, the police stealthily watched 
one at the end of a waterside lane. They monitored the comings and goings of its owner's 
private jet, subpoenaed his phone records and riffled through his trash. 
The owner was Jeffrey Epstein, 53, an intensely private New York money manager with 
several billionaire clients. Months earlier, the stepmother of a 14-year-old girl told the 
Palm Beach police that a wealthy older man, whom the girl later identified as Mr. 
Epstein, might have had inappropriate sexual contact with her. 
In sworn statements to the police, the 14-year-old and other teenage girls said a friend 
had arranged for them to visit Mr. Epstein's home and give him massages, usually in 
their underwear, in exchange for cash. 
Most of the girls, according to the police, said Mr. Epstein had masturbated during the 
massages, and a few said he had penetrated them with his fingers or penis. They 
identified him in photos and accurately described the inside of his home. Some recalled 
that his employees had fed them snacks or rented them cars. 
Mr. Epstein pleaded not guilty in August to the crime he was ultimately charged with, 
soliciting prostitution. But at a time when prosecutors around the nation have become 
increasingly severe in dealing with people accused of sex offenses, the case has raised 
questions about whether Mr. Epstein's prominence won him preferential treatment. 
By the account of the police, they found probable cause to charge Mr. Epstein with much 
more serious offenses: one count of lewd and lascivious molestation and four counts of 
unlawful sexual activity with a minor. 
But instead of proceeding with such charges on his own, the Palm Beach County state 
attorney took the rare step of presenting a broad range of possible charges to a grand jury, 
which indicted Mr. Epstein in July on the lesser count. In Florida, prosecutors usually 
refer only capital cases to grand juries. 
Even before the indictment, the Palm Beach police chief, Michael Reiter, had accused 
prosecutors of giving Mr. Epstein special treatment and asked the state attorney, Barry E. 
Krischer, to remove himself from the case. 
In an editorial, The Palm Beach Post attacked Mr. Krischer, a Democrat whose post is 
elective, saying the public had been left to wonder whether the system tilted in favor of 
a wealthy, well-connected alleged perpetrator and against very young girls who are 
alleged victims of sex crimes. 
The case has taken a toll on the reputation of Mr. Epstein, who owns a palatial home in 
Manhattan, has pledged $30 million to Harvard and once flew former President Bill 
Clinton on his 727. Politicians including Eliot Spitzer, a Democratic candidate for 
governor in New York, and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, also a Democrat, have 
returned campaign contributions from him. 
But Mr. Epstein fought back, assembling a team of star lawyers, including Gerald B. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030307 
Lefcourt and Alan M. Dershowitz, a friend of his, to look into the backgrounds of his 
young accusers. 
Mr. Lefcourt says that the police acted outrageously and that his client has been 
wrongfully dragged through the mud. 
He disputes that he ever had sex with any under-age person or anything like that, said 
Mr. Lefcourt, whose clients have included Russell Crowe, Martha Stewart and Abbie 
Hoffman. 
Neither the police nor the state attorney's office would discuss the case in detail. But the 
police released a thick report on the 13-month investigation after the indictment was 
unsealed in late July. 
The police started investigating Mr. Epstein in March 2005, almost immediately after 
they were contacted by the stepmother of the 14-year-old, who, according to the report, 
was in a special school for students with disciplinary problems. 
The girl, the report said, told the police that an older friend had offered her an 
opportunity to make money and had driven her to Mr. Epstein's house one Sunday. The 
friend, identified by the police as Haley Robson, a local community college student, told 
the girl to say she was 18 if Mr. Epstein asked, the report said. 
The girl told the police that Mr. Epstein's assistant had led her upstairs to a room with a 
massage table and that Mr. Epstein had come in and told her to remove her clothes. She 
said Mr. Epstein had masturbated as she massaged him, had pressed a vibrator against her 
underwear and had given her $300 afterward. 
In October, the police interviewed Ms. Robson, then 19, who told them Mr. Epstein had 
routinely paid her to bring teenage girls to his home. The police then interviewed a total 
of 5 alleged victims and 17 witnesses, many of whom told similar stories about what they 
had observed or participated in at Mr. Epstein's home. According to the report, at least 
one said Mr. Epstein had engaged in intercourse with her. 
Mr. Lefcourt, his lawyer, said one girl who told the police of having had sex with Mr. 
Epstein as a minor had lied about both the sex and her age and had not shown up for 
grand jury questioning. He also said Mr. Epstein had passed a lie-detector test clearing 
him of any sexual involvement with under-age girls. 
A spokeswoman for the Palm Beach police said that early this year, the police went to 
Mr. Krischer, the state attorney, intending to apply for warrants to arrest Mr. Epstein. 
Instead, she said, they were told that Mr. Krischer would convene a grand jury to 
examine the evidence and decide what charges, if any, to bring. 
Around that time, the police report said, Mr. Dershowitz met with prosecutors to share 
information about the accusers, including statements they had posted on MySpace.com, 
the social networking site, concerning use of drugs and alcohol. According to the report, 
Mr. Krischer's office then decided to delay the grand jury session for several months. 
The Palm Beach police grew frustrated, the report said, and on May 1 the department 
asked prosecutors to approve warrants to arrest Mr. Epstein. 
Chief Reiter also wrote Mr. Krischer questioning the unusual course that your office's 
handling of this matter has taken and suggesting that Mr. Krischer disqualify himself. 
Chief Reiter refused several requests to be interviewed, and his spokeswoman would not 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030308 
say explicitly why he had urged the prosecutor to step aside. 
Mike Edmondson, a spokesman for Mr. Krischer, said the state attorney's office 
sometimes sent noncapital cases to grand juries when there were questions about witness 
credibility. Mr. Krischer does not recommend a particular charge in such cases, Mr. 
Edmondson said, but gives the grand jury a list of possible charges. 
Bruce J. Winick, a law professor at the University of Miami, said that while prosecutors 
in Florida rarely referred noncapital cases to grand juries, they sometimes did so with 
sensitive cases to be extra-cautious. 
Mr. Lefcourt said the police were wrong to have released the report so soon, especially 
without correcting information that later proved wrong. He cited his assertion that one 
accuser had lied about her age, adding that she had also been arrested on drug charges 
and had been fired by her employer for stealing. 
What I'm trying to focus on, Mr. Lefcourt said, is, What's motivating the selective 
and misleading release of information to the public?

Financier Starts Sentence in Prostitution Case 
By LANDON THOMAS Jr. 
The bad news arrived by phone last week on Little St. James Island, the palm-fringed 
Xanadu in the Caribbean where Jeffrey E. Epstein, adviser to billionaires, lives in 
secluded splendor. 
Report to the Palm Beach County jail, the caller, Mr. Epstein's lawyer, said. 
So over the weekend Mr. Epstein quit his pleasure dome, with its staff of 70 and its 
flamingo-stocked lagoon, and flew to Florida. On Monday morning, he turned himself in 
and began serving 18 months for soliciting prostitution. 
I respect the legal process, Mr. Epstein, 55, said by phone as he prepared to leave his

Greenwald flew back to Brazil that day. Soon afterward, he would
resign from The Guardian. In February 2014, he became the co-
founding editor of The Intercept, an online publication dedicated to
investigative journalism, which was backed by the Internet billion-
aire Pierre Omidyar.

Poitras remained in Hong Kong, where she moved, along with the
Guardian reporter MacAskill, to the five-star Sheraton Hong Kong
Hotel & Towers, which, like the Mira hotel, was on Nathan Road in
Kowloon. The Guardian paid the bill. Her next task was to set up
what turned out to be Snowden’s final interview in Hong Kong. It
was scheduled for June 12.

The journalist chosen was Lana Lam, a young Australian reporter
working for the South China Morning Post. Tibbo had suggested
Lam to Snowden. She had served as Tibbo’s outlet on previous news
stories, and, as he told me, he found her to be a totally reliable jour-
nalist. He brought her to Poitras’s suite at the Sheraton in Kowloon.
First, Lam had to agree to the conditions of the interview, which
included submitting the story to Poitras for Snowden’s approval.

® Next, as Lam put it, Poitras “confiscated” her cell phone. Finally, ©
after a ten-minute wait, Poitras took her to another room and sat
her before a black laptop. The laptop, which had a Tor sticker on it,
had on its screen an online chat room where she was connected by
Poitras to Snowden.

“Hi Lana, thanks for coming for this,” Snowden said from his safe
house. He told her that the NSA had intercepted data from at least
sixty-one thousand different computers in Hong Kong, China, and
elsewhere. To expose what he called America’s “hypocrisy” in accus-
ing China of cyber espionage, he supplied her with relevant NSA
documents. “Last week the American government happily operated
in the shadows with no respect for the consent of the governed, but
no longer,” he said. “The United States government has committed a
tremendous number of crimes against Hong Kong [and] the People’s
Republic of China as well.” Under Poitras’s close supervision, Lam
was allowed to ask Snowden more questions about the NSA’s inter-
ception of communications in Hong Kong and China. He told her, “I
have had many opportunities to flee Hong Kong, but I would rather

question.

Roberts' lawyers says the latest allegations do not contend the fact she was used for underage sex.

Attorney Sigrid McCawleysaid : To say that our client acquiesced in this abuse, or that the abuse was OK because
she was paid for it — leaves out the fact that this is why we have laws in the United States to protect minor children
who are groomed and sexually trafficked by adults.

Epstein served 13 months in a Florida prison after pleading guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution.

Allegations: The 31-year-old is currently in the midst of a lawsuit claiming she was recruited to join Epstein's harem
of underage women in 1999, naming Prince Andrew and attorney Alan Dershowitz as two of the men she was made
to 'service'

The scandal resurfaced in January when Roberts named Prince Andrew in a lawsuit, accusing him of using her for
underage sex.

According to court records connected with Roberts’ current lawsuit, she maintains that she was recruited to join
Epstein's harem in 1999 by his friend, the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.

She says during the three years she worked for Epstein, she was made to entertain his friends and named Prince
Andrew and Dershowitz as two men she had sex with.

Both men have denied having sex with Roberts, and Dershowitz is trying to get his name removed from the suit,
claiming Roberts made the entire story up.

2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *937

Focusing specifically on the issue of victim impact information, the [*938] Third Circuit 1s correct that, under the current
rules, it is unworkable to provide advance notice of upward (or downward 44) departures based on victim allocution at the
sentencing hearing. Under my proposal, however, victims would be integrated into the presentence process for determining
Guidelines issues, thereby ensuring that the defense has fair notice of any upward departure and the government has fair notice
of any downward departure. Regardless of whether the Guidelines are advisory, this is the fairest way to proceed for
defendants, the prosecution, and victims.

(New) Rule 32(1)(4) - Victims' Right to be Reasonably Heard at Sentencing The Proposals:

Even before passage of the CVRA, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure gave victims of crimes of violence or sexual abuse
the right to be heard at sentencing. After the CVRA extended such rights to all victims, I proposed simply striking the limitation
in the rule so that it would apply to all victims as follows:

(B) By a Victim. Before imposing sentence, the court must address any victim of a the crime of violence or sexual abuse who is
present at sentencing and must permit the victim to speak or submit any information about the sentence ... . 434

The Advisory Committee tracked my change of striking the crimes of violence and sexual abuse limitation; but the Committee
also substituted language from the CVRA about being reasonably heard as follows:

(B) By a Victim. Before imposing sentence, the court must address any victim of a the crime of violence or sexual abuse who is

present at sentencing and must permit the victim to speak or submit any information about the sentence to be reasonably heard.
435

[*939] Discussion:

My proposal retained the current language in Rule 32 allowing the victim to speak or submit any information about the
sentence; the Advisory Committee would allow the victim to be reasonably heard at sentencing - language lifted from the
CVRA.

In this area, the Advisory Committee has paradoxically used the CVRA as an occasion for possibly restricting victims’ rights.
Under Rule 32()(4)'s current language, there is no doubt that the victim could speak at sentencing (that is, give an oral
statement). Under the proposed language, litigation could result about whether victims could be reasonably heard without
being allowed to speak (that is, be confined to purely written submissions). Indeed, during the Advisory Committee meeting on
the proposal, the Advisory Committee reporter conceded that courts would have to construe exactly what [the phrase] meant
as situations came before them. °°

It is worth reflecting for a moment on how backward the Advisory Committee's approach to this issue is. Before the CVRA's
enactment, victims of crimes of violence and sexual assault had the right under Rule 32(1) to speak at sentencing (along with
the right to submit information). When Congress enacted the CVRA, the Advisory Committee and the Judicial Conference had

(11th Cir. 2006); United States v. Vampire Nation, 451 F.3d 189, 195-98 (3d Cir. 2006); United States v. Walker, 447 F.3d 999, 1006-07
(7th Cir. 2006); United States v. Egenberger, 424 F.3d 803, 805 (Sth Cir. 2005). The First Circuit has held only that the failure to provide
notice does not constitute plain error. See United States v. Mateo, No. 06-1805, 2006 WL 1195676, at 1 (1st Cir. May 5, 2006).

#3 For a helpful correction to the idea that victims’ interests are always adverse to defense interests at sentencing, see generally Benji
McMurray, The Mitigating Power of a Victim Focus at Sentencing, 19 Fed. Sent'g Rep.125 (2006).

435 Proposed Amendments, supra note 71, R. 32(i)(4)(B), at 13. The Advisory Committee also proposes striking out existing language in the
tule allowing guardians or family members to exercise the right to speak on behalf of minor and incapacitated victims. For criticism of this
deletion, see supra notes 117-125 and accompanying text.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027859.txt,"The problem for Israel, no matter who or what party is in government, is that
there are risks everywhere one looks, and they show every sign of getting more,
not less, serious.

The “Arab Spring” has morphed into an Islamic winter. National frontiers
that were put in place by British and French diplomats after the fall of the
Ottoman Empire are vanishing. Centuries-old conflicts between tribes and rival
religious communities have reignited. The old Cold War system of nations has
given way to a world without a single geopolitical centre of gravity. Perhaps
most seriously, Iran seems determined to get nuclear weapons, and, in my view,
may succeed in doing so.

Where Israel is concerned, relations with our indisputably most important
ally, the United States, are more strained than at any time in decades.
Diplomatic ties with Europe, our single largest trading partner, have been
growing steadily worse. And the only real certainty is that anyone who tells you
that they know absolutely where things are heading next is lying. Just ask Hosni
Mubarak, who, despite having nearly half-a-million soldiers and security
operatives at his disposal, was utterly blindsided, and very soon toppled and
imprisoned, by an uprising that began with a sudden show of popular anger in
Cairo’s Tahrir Square.

Internally as well, Israel faces dangers. Chief among them is the alarming
erosion of the standards of civil discourse, amid the increasingly shrill, often
hateful, divisions between left and right, secular and religious, rich and poor
and, most seriously of all, Jews and Arabs. While we remain economically
successful, the fruits of our wealth are being ever more unevenly shared, and the
prospects for continued growth constrained by the lack of any visible prospect
of long-term peace.

Bibi Netanyahu, of course, knows all of this. Indeed, he has repeatedly
spoken of the multiple threats Israel faces, not only in somber terms, but at
times almost apocalyptically.

That works, politically. Politicians, not just in Israel but everywhere, know
that it is a lot easier to win elections on fear than on hope.

Yet my own prescription — learned, as this book recounts, from years on the
battlefield, then reinforced by my years in government — is that Israel must
resist being guided by either of those alternatives. Not fear, certainly. But
neither by simple, untempered hope. Though the stakes have become much
higher since my night flight back from Camp David nearly 15 years ago, our

And don’t tell us that the only way to teach a child is to spend
most of the year preparing him to fill in a few bubbles on a
standardized test. I don’t want teachers to be teaching to the
test. I don’t want them uninspired and I don’t want our students
uninspired.

Uh huh. Did he change No Child Left Behind? No. Of course not. Test-
ing dominates education as much as it ever did. All presidents are the
same, really. They can’t fight the vested interests, or won’t. I will avoid
figuring out why here, although, once again, John Dewey had much
to say on the subject of how governments stay in power by making
sure that people aren’t really educated.

We can’t count on politicians, but here is what we can do. We can
build it and then we can work inside or outside the system in such a
way that allows people to be able to come.

But how do you build a new high school system? Very simple: one
curriculum at a time. The trick is making sure that you put the curri-
cula online. We cannot change education one school at a time. Many
good schools have been created over the years. Today, John Dewey’s
Lab School (in Chicago), which was entirely a learning-by-doing place,
is now a college prep school. Having a few reasonable schools will not
change the system. A curriculum offered online is available to every-
one and eventually can provide an alternative to a system that offers
boring and mindless education.

In addition, online means choices. Once we create dozens, may-
be hundreds, of curricula from which to choose, students should be
able to learn anything they want to learn without regard to whether
a teacher for that curriculum or other students interested in that cur-
riculum happen to live nearby.

So, in an ideal world, what would these curricula be about?

They can be about anything that one can learn to do in the real
world (which would leave out all the traditional academic subjects).
They should teach teaching cognitive processes, of course, but one
should not endeavor to teach cognitive processes specifically, that is,
apart from their possible use. So, it is the use of these processes in
some area of real life that would be the intent of any full-year, story-
centered curriculum.

These curricula and any others that we would design have the
following characteristics:

Donald Trump's instincts regarding Jeffrey Epstein were solid. Rut if 
the reporters who were beginning to look into Epstein's mysterious 
background had dug a bit further, there's a chalice they would have hit 
pay dirt as well—and not just in Palm Beach. 
In California, for instance, a paper trail already stretched from the 
Santa Monica Police Department to Epstein's front door. 
In the spring—almost the summer—of 1997, a call came in to the 
police. The young woman who placed it—a young actress who'd 
appeared on Baywatch and General Hospital—said she'd been sexually 
assaulted at a trendy hotel called Shutters on the Beach. 
The officer who took the call knew the woman's name—
and her voice. A week earlier, she'd told him about an encounter with 
Epstein. The worliall had not wanted to make a formal complaint at the 
time. But she had taken the cop's card, and now he was happy to hear 
that she'd changed her mind. 
In a shaky voice, described Epstein as a tallish man—five feet 
eleven or six feet in height was her guess—with gray hair and brown 
eyes. He was the owner of a large black four-door Mercedes and was a 
regular at Shutters on the Beach, which was the kind of place that cost 
one thousand dollars a night and was frequented by actors, agents, and 
other Hollywood types.

of China); the China Working Group (led by members supportive of closer engagement
with China); and the Senate China Working Group (led by members supportive of closer
relations). Earlier legislation had established the Congressional-Executive Commission

on China, focused on human rights conditions in China (a perennial negative aspect

in US-China relations), and the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission,
which was known for its annual report listing a variety of developments in China seen

as adverse to US interests and values. While the latter two commissions continue to be
active, are robust, and have growing impact, many of the other exchange mechanisms
have proven less than durable. Once the leading members who founded such groups leave
Congress, interest usually wanes. The National People’s Congress became even more active
in supporting the growing number of congressional staff delegations to China during

this period. In 2018, the House China Working Group remained active, but the House
Congressional China Caucus and the Senate China Working Group were inactive.

Most recently, the 115th Congress has actively embraced the Trump administration’s view
that China has benefited more from the bilateral relationship than has the United States.
In fact, amidst all the partisan warfare currently dividing Republicans and Democrats in
Washington, a skepticism about China’s intentions and reliability and a willingness to
push back in a bipartisan manner against its un-reciprocal, and sometimes even predatory,
policies, is one of the most surprising phenomena. In 2018, for example, the Congress
unanimously passed the Taiwan Travel Act, which encourages the Trump administration to
host more high-ranking officials from Taiwan, a move that angered Beijing. Still, Congress is
hardly united, even on trade. Some members have objected to the adverse impacts punitive
tariffs are having on their constituencies, or they have opposed imposing tariffs on allies
at the same time tariffs are imposed on China. And some members criticized President
Trump’s decision in May 2018 to ease harsh sanctions against the prominent Chinese
high-technology firm ZTE, in response to a personal plea from the Chinese president.
Nevertheless, President Trump’s dominance in the Republican Party means that few in the
Republican ranks controlling Congress are inclined to oppose him, especially on China.
Indeed, Congress is generally endorsing the most significant reevaluation of American-
China policy since the start of normalization fifty years ago. As such, it can be said that
Chinese influence on Capitol Hill has reached a low point.

Conclusion and Recommendations

Congress is in the midst of a major reevaluation of the very assumptions underlying

the decades-old American policy of “engagement” with China. Because of this increasingly
competitive, even adversarial, new climate, Chinese influence and information operations
are widely coming to be seen as expressions of a political system whose values are
antithetical to those of the United States and as a threat to the integrity of Congress and
our democracy. Arguing, as many have done as far back as Majority Leader Mike Mansfield,
that Congress should move forward with positive engagement with China while seeking to

intelligence. A former top intelligence official told me “The queen on our chessboard had been
taken.”

To be sure, even after the loss of its “queen,” the game was not lost. The NSA moved to
mitigate the damage and find new ways of obtaining unexpected intelligence. In June 2014, the
new NSA director Admiral Michael Rogers had to confront flagging morale that, according to
former director Michael Hayden, was near-paralyzing the intelligence service. Admiral Rogers
recognized that as a direct result of the Snowden breach “the nation has lost capabilities against
adversaries right now who are attempting to actively undermine us. But even with that loss, he
observed “the sky has not fallen.” As in the Chicken Little fable he cited, the world had not
ended for the NSA. Nor had it ended for the multi-billion out-sourcing enterprise it
superintended. The NSA may have lost many of its sources, or “capabilities,” but Rogers held out
hope that new sources could be eventually found to replace them. Compromised codes, after all,
could be changed. New technological methods could be devised. New vulnerabilities also could
be targeted in enemy territories. Although repairing the damage might take many “decades.”
according to Michael McConnell, the Vice Chairman of Booz Allen, the new director had to get
on with that task. McConnell, a former NSA director himself, pointed out that the NSA
Director’s “first responsibility is to be the chief cheerleader. Rebuilding the NSA capabilities
assumed, however, that there would not be another Snowden-size breach.

The question remained: how could the NSA’s vaunted secrecy have been so deeply penetrated
by a mere analyst-in-training at a regional base in Oahu? The perpetrator himself could not be
asked. He was in Moscow, supposedly employed by an unnamed Russian cyber security firm. He
was also in his Moscow interviews pointing to the “incompetence” of the NSA. All that was
known for certain about the young man who had taken the “queen” from the board was that he
had gained entry to the NSA’s secret chambers through the back door, a portal opened to him by
the NSA’s reliance on outside contractors.

Putin. If one of the representatives of the dangers of capitalism is the state involvement in

also UKIP strongly defending Russian positions in geopolitical terms.

[Harnwell restates, but unintelligible]

Harnwell: These two parties have both been cultivating President Putin [unintelligible].
Bannon: [ think it’s a little bit more complicated. When Vladimir Putin, when you really
look at some of the underpinnings of some of his beliefs today, a lot of those come from
what I call Eurasianism; he’s got an adviser who harkens back to Julius Evola and different
writers of the early 20th century who are really the supporters of what’s called the
traditionalist movement, which really eventually metastasized into Italian fascism. A lot of
people that are traditionalists are attracted to that.

One of the reasons is that they believe that at least Putin is standing up for traditional
institutions, and he’s trying to do it in a form of nationalism — and I think that people,
particularly in certain countries, want to see the sovereignty for their country, they want to
see nationalism for their country. They don’t believe in this kind of pan-European Union
or they don’t believe in the centralized government in the United States. They'd rather see
more of a states-based entity that the founders originally set up where freedoms were

controlled at the local level.

“You’re seeing a global reaction to centralized
government, whether that government is in
Beying or that government 1s in Washington,
DC, or that government is in Brussels. So we
are the platform for the voice of that.”

I’m not justifying Vladimir Putin and the kleptocracy that he represents, because he
eventually is the state capitalist of kleptocracy. However, we the Judeo-Christian West

really have to look at what he’s talking about as far as traditionalism goes — particularly

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012819.txt,"O Schadenfreude

On February 15, 1978, a relatively unknown boxer with few professional fights, stepped into the Las
Vegas boxing ring and snatched the world heavyweight champion title from Muhammad Ali. Ah, along
with his entourage of managers, coaches and fans were shocked, though no one denied that he lost. The
unknown boxer was Leon Spinks. His only prior claim to fame, and ticket to a shot at Ali, was an
Olympic gold medal two years earlier. With this win, not only did Spinks enjoy the heavyweight belt of
champions, but a cash prize of $350,000 and a promise of $3.8 million for the rematch with Ali. But this
meteoric rise to the top fizzled into a meteoric crash, driven by women, alcohol, sports cars, and a lack of
training. Leon Spinks, aka “Neon Leon,” was living the fast life, and rapidly losing his status as a
respected sports hero.

Moments before his rematch with Ali, he cruised the streets of New Orleans on top of a limousine
while smoking a joint. He was flaunting his nonchalance, making fun of Ali’s age, and carrying on about
his ability to take the old champ without a single work out. When he entered the ring, Ali was ready.
Though the match went the full fifteen rounds, it was no contest. Ali won.

Newspaper writers and boxing fans celebrated the return of their champion, and mocked the
downfall of an ephemeral, arrogant, and out of control hero. After losing to Ali in the rematch, Neon
Leon crashed further, losing all of his earnings, taking on odd jobs for minimum wage, losing a son in a
gang fight, and suffering defeat after defeat in the boxing arena. From envied millionaire sports star to
bankrupt fool and the laughingstock of the boxing world.

When the envied fall down, we perversely enjoy the knock out. This is schadenfreude, a German
word that describes the joy we feel in witnessing another’s misfortune. Though the emotion is universally
understood, recognized in our written records at least as far back as Aristotle, the German language is one
of the few to capture the feeling by tapping the brain’s promiscuity, combining the word for harm
(schaden) with the word for joy (freude). Like envy, schadenfreude is a social, comparative emotion. It
erupts when those we envy fall down, when someone we dislike meets his comeuppance, and when a
misfortune is deserved. But like envy, schadenfreude presents two faces, one elevating and virtuous, the
other deflating and divisive. We should feel good when a person is caught crossing a moral line,
committing an injustice. Such feelings not only reinforce our own adherence to moral norms, but
encourage us to punish those who transgress. Such feelings instill courage in the service of expressing
moral outrage. As Robert F. Kennedy stated “Moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in battle
or intelligence.” Schadenfreude in this positive sense is the inner voice of moral courage. At the same

time, it can also be the inner voice of moral disengagement, providing justification for an observed harm.

would invalidate his passport to go anywhere except for his return to
the United States, and Interpol would issue a red alert to all its mem-

leave Hong Kong, he had to act swiftly.

Hong Kong airport authorities would be officially notified and could

would be an international fugitive. Tibbo counseled Snowden to seek
redress in the Hong Kong courts.

Kong to escape the legal consequences of his act. “The purpose of my

If so, he had merely been using Tibbo, Man, and Ho to provide him

Buckingham Palace issues second denial of underage sex

claims against Prince Andrew

I www.foxnews.com

June 6, 2012: In this file photo, Britain's Prince Andrew leaves King Edward VII hospital in London after visiting his
father Prince Philip. (AP)

Buckingham Palace officials have again denied claims made by a woman who alleged that she was forced to have
sex while underage with Prince Andrew, Duke of York.

The second denial comes after two Sunday papers in Britain published interviews with the woman in which she
claimed that she was forced by American financier Jeffrey Epstein to have sex with Prince Andrew at least three
times between 1999 and 2002. The woman alleges that the encounters took place in London, New York, and on a
Caribbean island owned by Epstein.

A Palace spokesman has said that the allegations are false and without any foundation.

It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with (the woman), the
statement continued. The denials are unusual because royal officials typically do not comment on allegations
against members of the royal family.

The woman's claims are part of a lawsuit in a Florida court relating to how prosecutors handled a sexual abuse case
against American financier Jeffrey Epstein. The woman, identified in court papers only as Jane Doe No. 3, is one
of two new accusers asking a West Palm Beach, Florida, judge to allow them to join the existing lawsuit against
Epstein. The royal is not named as a defendant in the case, and no criminal charges or formal allegations have
been made against him.

Western Union, which has the telegraph monopoly in America, to provide the Black Chamber
with all the telegrams coming into the United States. “Its far-seeking eyes penetrate the secret
conference chambers at Washington, Tokyo, London, Paris, Geneva, Rome,” Yardley wrote
about the Black Chamber. “Its sensitive ears catch the faintest whispering in the foreign capitals of
the world.” But in 1929, at the instructions of President Herbert Hoover, Secretary of State
Henry Stimson closed the Black Chamber saying famously “Gentlemen should not read each
other's mail.” The moratorium did not last long. With war looming in Asia and Europe, President
Franklin D. Roosevelt reactivated the operation as the Signals Security Agency. It proved its
value in breaking the Japanese machine-generated cipher “purple.” In June 1942, using deciphered
Japanese messages to pinpoint the location of the Japanese fleet at Midway; America’s won a
decisive naval victory in the Pacific. Germany’s Enigma encoding machines, with three encoding
wheels, proved more of a challenge. Initially British cryptanalysts led by the brilliant
mathematician Alan Turing succeeded in building a rudimentary computer to decipher German
messages to its submarines and bombers, but, in 1942, Germany added a fourth set of encoding
wheels, escalation what essentially was a battle of machine intelligence. The US Navy then
contracted with the National Cash Register Company to build a computing machine capable of
breaking the improved Enigma, and, in May 1943, it succeeded. By the time the war ended in
1945, the US had over one hundred giant decryption machines in operation. This unrivalled
capability to read the communications of foreign nations, which remained one of America’s most
closely guarded secrets, was transferred to the Army Security Agency based at Fort Meade,
Maryland. Then, on October 24, 1952, President Harry S. Truman, greatly expanded its purview
and changed its name to the National Security Agency.

The NSA was given two missions. The first one was protecting the communications of the
US government. The main threat to breaching U.S. government channels of communications was
the Soviet. The second one was intercepting all the relevant communications and signals of
foreign governments. This latter mandate included the governments of allies as well as enemies.
The President, the other intelligence services and the Department of Defense deemed what was
relevant for national security. Even though the NSA remained part of the Department of Defense,
its job went far beyond providing military intelligence. It also acted as a service agency to other
American intelligence services. They prepared shopping lists of foreign communications
intelligence and the NSA fulfilled them.

As the Cold War heated up in the 1960s, the NSA provided intelligence not only to the
Pentagon but to the Department of State, Central Intelligence Agency, the Treasury Department,
the Atomic Energy Commission, and the FBI. With a multi-billion dollar “black budget” hidden
from public scrutiny, the NSA’s technology directorate invested in state-of-the-art equipment,
including super computers that could break almost any cipher, antennae mounted on
geosynchronous satellites that vacuumed in billions of foreign telephone calls and other exotic
capabilities. It also devised stealthy means of breaking into channels that its adversaries believed
were secure. This enterprise required not only an army of technical specialists capable of

The MRS in fitness is obtained by rearranging this expression to obtain

Ak(?) 4
where
= eT r(ym®) + (1 —y)P@v)\ (6 (15)

and y = a/(a + (2) measures the relative importance of marginal fertility.

In what follows, I will take «@) = «@) so that the final term in 7 disappears. This restricts
attention to the MRS at points along the 45° line in figure 1. In intergenerational transfers there
is good reason for interest in these values. At stationary equilibrium, the consumption of an in-
dividual at age x‘ must equal that of her daughter one generation hence. Thus, intergenrational
investments are governed by the MRS in preferences along the 45° line, which must also equal the
MRS in exchange and the marginal productivity of intergenerational investment.4 These quantities
could all be predicted from the MRS in fitness along the 45° line. For transfers over shorter inter-
vals, there is less reason for concern with the MRS along the 45° line. For these cases, the present
approach will tell only part of the story.

3.1.1 The evolutionary discount function

To facilitate presentation of numerical results, I define an evolutionary discount function X, which

satisfies air
MRS p = ede *(@w)dw (16)

For example, when ) is a constant, future benefits are discounted exponentially at a constant rate.
\ can accomodate nearly any form of discounting, and is closely related to the marginal rate of
time preference (MRTP): the average value of \ over any age-interval predicts the MRTP over that
interval [15, Eqn. 15]. I calculate from age-specific fertility and survival data using the methods
described by Rogers [15].

3.1.2 Demographic statistics

Ideally, \ should be estimated using demographic statistics that reflect some sort of long-term
average of human demographic history. This, of course, is impossible. I have instead relied on
demographic statistics from modern “natural-fertility” populations, whose vital rates are thought
to resemble those of pre-industrial populations.° It would be unwise, however, to take any single
modern population as the examplar of our unknown ancestors. We do not know whether prehistoric
human demography was more similar to that of 19th century Taiwan, or that of 19th century Utah,
to name just two possibilities. Nonetheless, it seems likely that species-wide mean demographic

4See [13, p. 172] and [15, Footnote 12].

5A natural-fertility population is one in which birth-control is either absent, or else is applied independently of the
number of a woman’s existing children. In natural-fertility populations, women may use birth control to space births,
but they do not use it to achieve a target family size [1].

marina sales have indicated that now is a good time to invest in a marina, despite the previous
recession and limited financing.

Competitive Marinas

The most significant supply and demand indicators for the subject are rental and occupancy rates
experienced by directly competing properties. The operation of a pleasure craft marina provides
revenue sources which include a mix of various rental, sales and services for the pleasure craft
operators. Principle revenue stream for pleasure craft marinas includes in-water slips, fuel sales, and
building rent.

The subject’s asking and average contract rates are shown in the table that follows. The current
operator is leasing the marina slips by linear feet of vessel length. We have then converted this rental
income into a rental rate per linear foot of dock space. The subject offers slip rental on a daily, weekly,
monthly, seasonal and annual basis. The contracted rental rates represent a blend of these rates, from
daily tenants to long term tenants on annual leases. According to management, approximately 60% of
the occupants at any given time are seasonal or annual tenants.

Average 105 54 2,063,127 1,240,968 60.1% $1,441,192 $35.35

We weren't provided with a current rent roll for the marina slips but we were provided with monthly
historical occupancy and rental rate data. With the transient nature of marina tenants, a historical
rent and occupancy figures are a more accurate indication of the income properties of the marina.
Rental rates at the subject, and in this market, are based ona rate per linear foot of vessel length. As
discussed earlier, the subject contains 105 wet slips with a total of 5,680 linear feet of rentable dock
space, which indicates a total of 2,073,200 rentable linear feet per year.

As of the effective valuation date, the subject marina has experienced an overall occupancy rate of
56.3% for the year to date 2015. We have looked at occupancy rates on an average, annual basis due
to the seasonal characteristics of this property type in this market. Again, due to the transient nature
of the tenants in this property type and the short term nature of the leases which can range from daily
to annually, the overall occupancy rate will be lower than other commercial property types such as
lodging, multifamily, retail and office. The subject’s current occupancy rate is slightly lower than
historical rates, but the property is considered to be at stabilized occupancy.

The weighted average contract rate is $37.29 per linear foot per month for the year to date 2015,
which equates to an average contract rate of $447.50 per linear foot per year.

80,000 more in secondary schools). Moreover, millions of Chinese have immigrated to
the United States seeking to build their lives with more economic, religious, and political
freedom, and their presence has been an enormous asset to American life.

However, these virtues cannot eclipse the reality that in certain key ways China is
exploiting America’s openness in order to advance its aims on a competitive playing field
that is hardly level. For at the same time that China’s authoritarian system takes advantage
of the openness of American society to seek influence, it impedes legitimate efforts by
American counterpart institutions to engage Chinese society on a reciprocal basis. This
disparity lies at the heart of this project’s concerns.

China’s influence activities have moved beyond their traditional United Front focus

on diaspora communities to target a far broader range of sectors in Western societies,
ranging from think tanks, universities, and media to state, local, and national government
institutions. China seeks to promote views sympathetic to the Chinese Government,
policies, society, and culture; suppress alternative views; and co-opt key American players to
support China’s foreign policy goals and economic interests.

Normal public diplomacy, such as visitor programs, cultural and educational exchanges,
paid media inserts, and government lobbying are accepted methods used by many
governments to project soft power. They are legitimate in large measure because they are
transparent. But this report details a range of more assertive and opaque “sharp power”
activities that China has stepped up within the United States in an increasingly active
manner.* These exploit the openness of our democratic society to challenge, and sometimes
even undermine, core American freedoms, norms, and laws.

knew could succeed. An operation on which the fate of three Israeli pilots
depends. One of whom we know personally, and have worked with. Now, again,
with no real reason, you’ve stopped us. I see this as a breach of trust.” When
neither Dado nor Motta replied, I went on: “I have to tell you openly. You can’t
possibly judge the situation on the ground. Only we can. And you’re behaving
as if you know. You can’t know from here. There was no reason for us not to
grab those officers. I don’t want to reach a point when I have to start thinking
about what to report back, or not report, just to make sure we’re free to
complete a mission that you ordered, after agreeing it was necessary for Israel.”

No one said anything for a few moments. I could see that Uzi, Mookie and
Bibi were shocked at having heard me speak in this way to three of the top
commanders of the armed forces. But I meant every word. If Sayeret Matkal
was to function as a special-forces unit, it needed to have the trust of those
who’d authorized an operation in the first place. It was Dado who finally
replied. Sort of. Trying to defuse the tension, he told us a joke from his Palmach
days. “There are two bulls who come into a field full of cows. A young one and
old one. The young one says to the old guy: let’s run over there to the far end of
the field, where the prettiest cow is, and we can fuck her. The old bull replies:
“No need to rush. Let’s go slowly, and fuck them all.”

I guess we were meant to be the young bulls.

I doubt Dado knew whether we’d get a third chance at the Syrian officers,
though I’m sure he hoped so. A week later, we got word there would be a final
inspection visit, to the central sector of the border area. Ordinarily, I would have
led the operation. Now, I made an exception. To Dado’s obvious surprise, I
decided to remain behind, in the command post. “A commander has to be in the
best place to ensure a mission is successfully completed,” I told him. “I’ve
come to the conclusion the only way I can do that is to be here with you.
Because the real bottleneck isn’t out there in the field. It’s here.”

I placed Yoni, who had just become my deputy, in overall command of the
two main teams: Uzi Dayan’s and another led by one of our most impressive
young officers, a kibbutznik named Danny Brunner. He reminded me a lot of
Nechemia Cohen: he spoke little, and softly, but once an operation began was
calm, clear minded and able to anticipate and avoid trouble before it
materialized. Two other teams, one led by Mookie Betzer and the other by Shai
Agmon, would act as blocking units, concealed half-a-mile on either side, once
the main force intercepted the convoy. We chose a spot across from the Israeli

these subconscious choices, then there is no need to fix anything. But
often we might behave differently in how we treat others, if we real-
ized what we were doing. Getting along with people is a very big part
of life. Each of us has our own distinct personality and often it doesn’t
match with our own ambitions and desires. To change our behavior,
we need to practice new behaviors that become as natural to us as
our old behaviors. The only way to do this is to do it. People can help
point out what you are doing that isn’t helpful to your needs but that
does not mean you can easily change. If you want to change, you need
to try new behaviors and practice them. This can be coached. Practic-
ing new behaviors and being critiqued can help greatly. Written com-
munication is handled the same way.

2. Teamwork: Learning how to achieve goals by using a team,
consciously allocating roles, managing inputs from others,
coordinating actors, and handling conflicts

It is the rare individual who works all alone. Most people need
to work with others. Children are not naturally good at this and are
taught to “share.” Then they sometimes do what is called “parallel
play” where they play near one another doing different things. Get-
ting kids to cooperate to do something together is not easy. Usually
one wants to dominate the others. There is nothing wrong with this
per se. People are who they are and they need to assume roles in any
team that are consonant with their personalities. One person plays
quarterback and another blocks. People do not have to do the same
thing in order to work together. But they do need to get along and
function as a team. This is no more true of sports than it is of the
workplace. People learn to work in teams by working in teams and re-
ceiving helpful advice when a team is dysfunctional. Football coaches
explicitly teach this. More formal learning situations (like school) of-
ten don’t, which is unfortunate. It really isn’t possible to get along in
the real world unless you can assume various roles in a team that fit
with who you are.

3. Negotiation: Making a deal; negotiation/contracts

Contracts, formal and informal, are the basis of how we function.
We reach agreements in business, in marriage, in friendship, in a store,

(3) Sentence Recommendation. By local rule or by order in a case, the court may direct the probation officer not to disclose to
anyone other than the court the officer's recommendation on the sentence. 39?

I further recommended that victims be given the opportunity to object to and be heard on disputed issues in the presentence
report as follows:

(f) Objecting to the Report.

(1) Time to Object. Within 14 days after receiving the presentence report, the parties must state in writing any objections,
including objections to material information, sentencing guideline ranges, and policy statements contained in or omitted from
the report. The attorney for the government or for the victim shall raise for the victim any reasonable objection by the victim to
the presentence report.

(2) Serving Objections. An objecting party must provide a copy of its objections to the opposing party and to the probation
officer.

(3) Action on Objections. After receiving objections, the probation officer may meet with the parties and the victim to discuss
the objections. The probation officer may then investigate further and revise the presentence report as appropriate.

(h) Notice of Intent to Consider Other Sentencing Factors. 73 Before the court may rely on a ground not identified either in the
[*930] presentence report or in a party's prehearing submission or in a victim impact statement, the court must give the parties
reasonable notice that it is contemplating either departing from the applicable guideline range or imposing a non-guideline
sentence. The notice must specify any ground not earlier identified on which the court is contemplating a departure or a non-
guideline sentence. The attorney for the government or for the victim shall advise defense counsel and the court of any ground
identified by the victim that might reasonably serve as a basis for departure.

(i) Sentencing.
(1) In General. At sentencing, the court:

(A) must verify that the defendant and the defendant's attorney have read and discussed the presentence report and any
addendum to the report;

(B) must give to the defendant and an attorney for the government a written summary of - or summarize in camera - any
information excluded from the presentence report under Rule 32(d)(3) on which the court will rely in sentencing, and give them
a reasonable opportunity to comment on that information;

(C) must allow the parties' attorneys and any victims to comment on the probation officer's determinations and other matters
relating to an appropriate sentence; and

(D) may, for good cause, allow a party or any victim to make a new objection at any time before sentence is imposed.

(2) Introducing Evidence; Producing a Statement. The court may permit the parties or the victim to introduce evidence on the
objections. If a witness testifies at sentencing, Rule 26.2(a)-(d) and (f) applies. If a party fails to comply with a Rule 26.2 order
to produce a witness's statement, the court must not consider that witness's testimony.

(3) Court Determinations. At sentencing, the court:

(A) may accept any undisputed portion of the presentence report as a finding of fact;

392 Cassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 892.

393 This rule was amended in December 2006, after my earlier article was published, to change departure language to conform with the
new, post-Booker regime. I have accordingly changed the language quoted in the text above to conform to the current language.

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013442.txt,"﻿Navigating our presidential campaign was a piece of cake compared to understanding the nuances of the 2011 Oscar race for the most revered artistic honor in the world.



This is how nine films fell into the big picture. 



Three premiered in Cannes mid-May, a distant nine months ago, creating an Oscar campaign as long as any human pregnancy.



At the Palais, the first inkling of Oscar buzz was born as reclusive Woody Allen premiered Midnight in Paris.



PBS later aired a documentary of Woody discussing his forty-four films showing the astonishing depth of his talent that made you want to immediately hand him the Oscar for Best Picture. Academy rules and Woody forbade marketing this gem.  



Woody is not a member of the Academy because he doesn’t feel that films should be in competition. He told me, A statue does not change your life. You still get a cold. You can't get a date. You still have everyday things to worry about. The Academy learned to love him from a distance and gave him best original screenplay as a consolation. 



Terrence Malick's long awaited esoteric The Tree of Life unveiled at Cannes and won the coveted  Palme D'Or  positioning it for a nomination. 



The Artist, created by the French, shot in Hollywood and about Hollywood was the festival surprise. This charming and oddly original black and white silent entry was introduced by the ringmaster himself, Harvey Weinstein. No one could pronounce or spell director Michel Hazanavicius's name. Jean Dujardin could not speak a word of English and neither could his 10 year old co-star, the Jack Russell Uggie who had been rescued from the pound after two adopters found him too wild. Tragically Uggie developed an undisclosed neurological disorder during production, forcing him to retire at the height of his popularity. 



No slam dunk Oscar winner emerged in Cannes. Any future film could easily win.  



DreamWorks’ The Help premiered in LA in August and distributer Disney began propelling the politically correct and socially significant film to box office heaven of $200 million. Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer were forecast to win Oscars.  



In September, the Toronto and New York Film Festivals and Fox Searchlight presented Alexander s's Hawaiian family saga, The Descendants, which broke out of the pack with whispers of winning. Beloved George Clooney, playing a father for the first time was hailed a shoe-in for best actor. Directing Ides of March was additional momentum.



Also at New York's festival Marty Scorsese and Paramount sneaked an unfinished cut of Hugo in Alice Tully Hall, built for concerts but converted into a 3-D theater. Marty was christened the visionary genius of an innovative costly 3-D masterpiece.



Director Bennett Miller's highly anticipated Moneyball for Sony hit a grand slam at its west coast premiere in Oakland aligning the film, it’s heart throb star Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill and seasoned writers Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin in play.



Spielberg's epic War Horse for DreamWorks came thundering down the pike with a huge premiere back at Alice Tully Hall with posters of Lincoln Center's Tony winning theatrical War Horse with their indelible puppets in the background. Steven paid homage to legends John Ford and David Lean and the country fell in love with a horse named Joey and his fourteen stand-ins.



Studios worked their stars to the bone. Ironically, Harvey's independent French talent who lived in Paris were not as available as their competitors, therefore Uggie became a super star igniting a pet war.



Christopher Plummer, who had best supporting actor in the bag promoted his Jack Russell, Cosmo. Diminutive Scorsese was seen on TV on a small couch with his large Doberman, Blackie drooling on his suit. Spielberg never got a chance to trot out his lead horse Joey, previously seen in Seabiscuit because his ravishing reddish coat was now darkened for another role. 



By December, as film critics bestowed their own awards upon many films, Stephen Daldry struggled to finish Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close with a new score. There was buzz Daldry could be editing the winner. Producer Scott Rudin juggled his astounding three films in one year from Daldry, Miller and David Fincher directing “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.”



Daldry had received three consecutive directing nominations. In January, for his fourth film, he received a best picture nomination, for a boy's emotional journey dealing with 9/11, and the nine films were officially off and running. Forty-five film and media groups handed out awards leading up to Oscar night.



Wednesday, February 22



My airplane seatmate to LAX was Sony Classics Michael Barker. The night before Woody Allen had shown Michael Nero Fiddled, his latest film shot in Rome rumored to be his best.  



When Woody won the Oscar Sunday night, for a record breaking 23rd overall nomination, he had just finished pasta a Sette Mezzo on Lexington Avenue with art dealer Lorinda Ash and Soon-Yi.  He went home and watched the N.B.A. All-Star game. Soon-Yi watched the awards show on a delay in another room.  By the time Woody won, he fell asleep and Soon-Yi didn’t want to wake him. The next morning he went to the breakfast table alone and read in The New York Times he won. He had to think it was a good omen and he would not catch a cold that day.



Before Michael and I flattened our recliner chairs for the big sleep, I told him I felt confident his Iranian film, A Separation was winning best foreign picture. He told me The Artist would take best picture and director.  Actor was a tight race between Brad Pitt, Jean Dujardin, the Clooney of France and the real George Clooney.  George was essentially running against a version of himself, which only slightly amused him.



The biggest dilemma was Viola vs. Meryl. Michael picked Meryl as New Yorkers did.  The Help had taken on a life of its own lead by vivacious Viola in LA. The Iron Lady, a much criticized film showcased Meryl's tour de force performance. Few knew at the last minute, on President's weekend Harvey's shout out, She hasn't won in 29 years! resonated. 



An androgynous driver named Monica greeted me at the airport in a black tuxedo that would make Albert Nobbs weep for joy, prompting me to devilishly think of her as Nobbs all weekend.  She barely recognized me sporting a new Sally Hershberger hairdo, the yenta with the dragon tattoo.



Checking into the Beverly Hills Hotel I bumped into best actress nominee, Golden Globe and Spirit Award winner Michelle Williams with her daughter Matilda Ledger headed to the swimming pool. Innocently standing there with no makeup she was remarkably the antithesis of Marilyn Monroe.  I told her she so deserved the Oscar for her mesmerizing transformation which did not cheer her up knowing the gold was going to Viola or Meryl.



This year there seemed to be more parties than ever. Vanity Fair publisher Edward Menicheschi  staged a staggering six nights of “CAMPAIGN HOLLYWOOD.” Ermenegildo Zenga and Colin and Livia Firth hosted an intimate dinner at the Chateau Marmont to benefit Oxfam America, Colin’s pet charity.  Editor Graydon Carter and Edward greeted Cameron Diaz, Kristin Davis, Gary and Alexandra Oldman, Mia Wasikowska.  In addition, Livia spoke about her 'Green Carpet Challenge' which uses eco-friendly fabrics for “wear it once” gowns at awards shows. Get it?  Go green on red. 



It was a busy night at the Chateau as French billionaire investor Nicolas Berggruen hosted his party for young, leggy, breathtakingly beautiful models. Lindsay Lohan was on the loose after a judge having announced she was making great progress. She showed up sober wearing a new face bloated with injectable Restalyne that could only be preparation to portray Elizabeth Taylor in Liz and Dick, her film for Lifetime. Peter Brant and Stephanie Seymour and Peter Morton and Linda Evangelista joined Josh Harnett and Emile Hirsh under the terrace heaters. The boys were looking for love in all the right places.



Thursday, February 23



Thursday night boasted fifteen events causing party panic.  Here is a brief rundown of seven.



At The Hollywood Reporters Nominees Night, editor Janice Min and publisher Lynne Segall greeted the power brokers. With ballots in, competing studios cordially mingled in the mayor’s backyard.  Owen Wilson slipped in the back door and hung with     Michael Sheen and producer Letty Aronson.  Producers Kathy Kennedy and Frank Marshall chatted with DreamWorks partner Stacey Snyder, producer Graham King and Emily Mortimer.  Fox's Tom Rothman and Jim Gianopulos compared notes with Focus's James Shamus.     Young directors Drake Doremus (Like Crazy), Sean Durkin (Martha Marcy May Marlene) and Oscar nominee and Spirit Award winner J.C. Chandor (Margin Call) drank at the bar. Breakout directors Nick Jarecki (Arbitrage), Zal Batmanglij (Sound of My Voice and The East) and Jay Duplass (Jeff Who Lives at Home) dreamed about their future nominations.    Aaron Sorkin, Piers Morgan and Lawrence O'Donnell handicapped Romney vs. Obama as     Brooklyn Decker sashayed by.



Urs Fisher's exhibition Beds & Problem Paintings featured two bed sculptures at Larry Gagosian's Gallery followed by his private dinner at Mr. Chow's. Art lovers Vera Wang, Russell Simmons, Steve Martin, Jean Pigozzi and John Waters attended.



The US-Ireland Alliance honored nominees Hugo screenwriter John Logan, Bridesmaids star Melissa McCarthy and Michelle Williams at Bad Robot. Logan also wrote Rango”  Coriolanus, 007’s Skyfall and Jersey Boys for the big screen.



Alfre Woodard hosted a down and dirty girls night out in a rented house above Sunset for Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer. 



Universal honcho Ron Meyer hosted a civilized private buffet at his Malibu home for Graydon Carter with Tom Cruise, Leonardo DiCaprio, Barbra Streisand, Tom Hanks and Michael Douglas.



Stunning socialite Betsey Bloomingdale gave a seated dinner at her Holmby Hills home for best friends Nancy Reagan, Wendy Stark, Bob Colacello, Joan Collins and fashion icon Lynn Wyatt.



Tobias Meyer, auctioneer for Sotheby’s and art dealer Mark Fletcher hosted an open house at their Mulholland Drive home for English avant garde photographer Terry Richardson.  This is the only pre-Oscar party where a guest dropped his pants and mooned the red carpet and Terry signed a fans breast. Art collectors Bill and Maria Bell,         Todd Eberle, rock singer Jack Donahue and Francesco Clemente             ____schmoozed.



Friday, February 24



At the BHH I ran into David Heyman, English producer of the Harry Potter franchise who was honored at the Publicists Awards lunch at The Beverly Hilton.  “Motion Picture Showman of the Year” was the consolation prize for being snubbed by the Academy for visualizing a publishing miracle for children around the world.



“Nobbs” whisked me off to the     British Film Reception hosted by Jeremy Hunt, UK Secretary for Culture and Olympics,        and the British Consul-General Dame Barbara Hay, in her Hancock Park residence. Upon introduction, I blurted out that my friend Lord Astor, was interested in having LA people get to know his son-in-law, Prime Minister David Cameron. As an appointed diplomat she was horrified by my indiscretion and turned to greet the next American idiot. I was just making conversation.



Daldry told Sony’s Sir Howard Stringer and astute film CEO Michael Lynton, Kenneth Branagh, Janet McTeer, and Gary Oldman    that he, as executive producer of the Olympics, was headed        back to London to oversee      special events, including the opening ceremony, directed by Danny Boyle. 



Victoria Beckham made a dramatic sullen last-minute appearance looking perfectly skinny in her own designed dress.



At the Women in Film party at Cecconi's,      Gwyneth Paltrow,  Shailene Woodley, Selena Gomez       and Vanessa Hudgens networked with Jessica, Octavia and Viola now of social stamina fame.



Blythe Danner kissed me at the door as a military type looked on. I kept saying to him, Where have we met? Nowhere. He was astronaut Mark E. Kelly who came with Blythe and is married to former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, Paltrow's second cousin.  Only I could mistake an astronaut for a movie marketing guy. 

 

Vanity Fair feted Scorsese and The Film Foundation which has saved 555 films in 22 years. Cocktails were at the restored Bel-Air Hotel. Honorary Jewess Lorraine Bracco ran past me yelling she was late for Ronald Perelman's Shabbat dinner. Three, three-time Oscar winners: composer Howard Shore, costume designer Sandy Powell and editor Thelma Schoonmaker were honored. Sir Ben Kingsley, Danny Huston, Patty Clarkson, Irwin Winkler and Giorgio Armani's niece Roberta Armani with Wanda McDaniels debated best director: Marty or Michel?



“Nobbs” delivered me to WME's Party at kahuna Ari Emanuel's Brentwood estate, where NFL quarterback and new client Tim Tebow was the toast of the party, especially to Taylor Swift who made $35.7 million this year. Michael Douglas gave me a kiss…doesn’t get any better.        Lovebirds Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart made a     rare appearance, glued to each other's hips. They mingled with co-star Taylor Lautner, Miley Cyrus and her Hunger Games beau Liam Hemsworth.  Meanwhile Charlize Theron, Jack Black, Rooney Mara, Ben Stiller, Barry Sonnenfeld and Larry David talked business with moguls       Les Moonves and Viacom's Philippe Dauman.



Next was UTA Chairman Jim Berkus' soiree that police almost shut down because the DJ got carried away impressing Harrison Ford, Channing Tatum, Jerry Bruckheimer, Tom Freston, Disney's Rich Ross, SNL's Lorne Michaels and Oscar show producer Brian Grazer.



Sunset Tower Hotel owner Jeff Klein and producer John Goldwyn hosted a secretive dinner for Anna and Graydon Carter at their Hollywood Hills home with Tom Ford, Mitch Glazer,    Fran Lebowitz, Vito Schnabel, Denise Hale, Lisa and Eric Eisner and VF's Punch Hutton, who is Tim Hutton's sister.  _____   



Last stop was CAA Byran Lourd's Friday Night Party. “Nobbs” was instructed to drop me off at a neighborhood school where a luxury van transported guests to the stone and glass Bel-Air estate situated on a narrow street. I knew that guests    Colin Firth, Penelope Cruz, Sofia Vergara, Salma Hayek, Sandra Bullock, and Glee's Matthew Morrison did not arrive by bus. Once inside the playing field leveled out and pound for pound there was more famous flesh per square inch than at the Oscars themselves. 



I huddled with Meryl on the couch and we talked about her race. She thought Viola. I thought Meryl. She didn't know about Harvey’s last minute 29 year shout out.  



I hugged Bette Midler,    flirted with Jim Sturgess and Bennett Miller.      Universal's Donna Langley, who is overseeing Tom Hooper's production Les Miserable mentioned Hugh Jackman's impeccable manners should insure best behavior from Russell Crowe. 



I introduced HBO’s Game Change director Jay Roach who is an authority on Hitler, to George Clooney who is writing a thriller about the Nazis stealing art. Clooney whispered, “The Frenchman is winning.”



I thanked Bryan Lourd, Kevin Huvane and Richard Lovett, got on the bus and prayed that I get invited back.



Saturday, February 25



I dragged my tired ass to the Academy, as foreign films aficionado Mark Johnson was conducting a symposium on the nominated films, which included Sony Classic’s “In Darkness” from Poland, Footnote from Israel and A Separation from Iran. Israeli and Iranian governments from the other side of the world monitored their directors as the Sony boys kept the peace.



Michael and Tom Bernard invited me to the Independent Spirit Awards at the Santa Monica Pier.  Michael hosted his Take Shelter nominees Jessica Chastain, Michael Shannon and director Jeff Nichols.  Tom held court      at the next table with the entire Iranian cast of A Separation, which won.  Tom almost had a heart attack     when I threw my arms around Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, which in Iran is unacceptable behavior especially by a Jewish American Princess.  Tom wished I had gone to the crowded champagne brunch in honor of Prince Albert and Princess Charlene at the Bel-Air Hotel where Montblanc launched Grace Kelly watches. Simultaneously, TV producer Gary Pudney hosted another secretive lunch which Albert and Charlene actually attended with Graydon Carter, Carolina Herrera, Wallace Annenberg, Bobby Shriver, Bobby Marx, Kathy and Ricky Hilton and Lynn Wyatt. Wolfgang Puck joined them for dessert. 



The French, as the The Artist gang was nicknamed, had won six Cesars, France's version of the Oscars in Paris the night before. They flew all night and Harvey's chauffeur arranged a police escort from LAX just in time for them to win four Spirit Awards, cementing the Oscar win. 



Back at the BHH, Spielberg was the first to arrive at the tenth annual Night Before fundraiser in support of the Motion Picture and Television Fund. Jeffrey Katzenberg had already secured $200 of a $350 million fundraising goal that included money from him, Tom Cruise, Steve Bing, Casey Wasserman, Clooney and Spielberg. Every nominee showed up.



Chanel and Charles Finch cooked up their chic soiree at Madeo, where a mariachi band enthusiastically announced everyone's arrival.  Bedecked exclusively in Chanel were Diane Kruger, Rose Byrne, Ginnifer Goodwin, and Rachel Bilson      .  Also air kissing were Rachel Zoe, Rosanna Arquette, Alice Evans and Ioan Gruffudd, Zachary Quinto, and Julia Ormond.



Elizabeth Olsen who has six upcoming films, gushed to Dustin Hoffman that Wag the Dog was her favorite movie.  I sat next to director, Michael Apted who was editing “Of Men and Mavericks,” a surfer film he co-directed with Curtis Hanson. 



“My Week With Marilyn’s” English director Simon Curtis insisted we join Kenneth Branagh at The Weinstein Company’s bash at the Soho House in time to hear Tony Bennett sing “Autumn Leaves” to Harvey’s surprised 86 year-old mother Miriam, Madonna and Meryl. Jean Dujardin, Berenice Bejo, Michel Hazanavicius and producer Thomas Langmann staggered around completely jet lagged and too tired to speak English     . Uggie on the other hand was the absolute star of the evening as his trainer placed him in everyone’s arms for photo two shots. “W.E’s” Andrea Riseborough and Abbie Cornish sat next to baseball cap-clad Leonardo DiCaprio as his ex Bar Refaeli kept her distance across the room. Zoe Saldana walked in holding hands with Bradley Cooper. Scarlett Johansson introduced me to her boyfriend Nate Naylor. Katy Perry, Felicity Jones and Malin Akerman circled a refreshed Gerard Butler.  The two daughters of New York slain hero cop Peter Figoski, Corrine, 14 and Caroline, 16  who had also been Harvey’s guests at the Super Bowl stood in the middle of this circus and just fainted.



Sunday, February 26



I met interior designer Nicky Haslam in the Polo Lounge and found Nancy Reagan brunching with Bob Colacello and Carolina Herrera.  Nancy knows me as “The DVD Lady.” I promised to send her “The Iron Lady”.  I didn’t have the heart to tell her that her husband, who was Margaret Thatcher’s best friend, was barely mentioned in the film. 



In a Marchesa gown, Dennis Basso fur and Iradj Moini necklace,    I collected Simon Curtis and headed to the Hollywood & Highland Center. Simon, who has never been to the Oscars before, miraculously scored a front row seat between Michelle Williams and Clooney.  We pulled up to screams of hysteria at the mother of all red carpets.        We ended up in front of thousands of cameras and I instructed Simon to take baby steps for an hour. 



Meryl’s publicist Leslee Dart whispered to me. “She is dressed like an Oscar. What do we do if she loses?” Sacha Baron Cohen hilariously guilted the Academy into letting him wear his costume from “The Dictator” and after soiling Ryan Seacrest he went directly to dinner at Vanity Fair. Gwyeneth Paltrow won the style award in Tom Ford’s white column and Angelina Jolie so successfully invented a new one legged pose in a thigh high slit gown on the red carpet she repeated it for 39.3 million people onstage. 

Tickets were so tight that I gave my plus one to Penelope Ann Miller because she promoted “The Artist” every day for four months. Seated next to us were co-stars James Cromwell and Missi Pyle. 



Billy Crystal made us laugh, Cirque de Soleil made us gasp and most of the wins were expected.        

Colin Firth crowned Meryl her third win on a record 17 nominations and Harvey beamed.  ______



The Academy was so confident The Artist would win; they invited Uggie, who waited in the wings and ran out as Tom Cruise announced the film.  



Once the show was off the air, I followed my seatmates to the stage loaded with their programs,    wraps and handbags and led the French to the press rooms. 



The Governor's Ball was the next stop where the winners got their Oscars engraved. Everyone paid respects to the Academy’s Tom Sherak and Dawn Hudson.    Stars headed to the Sunset Tower to Graydon’s glittering Vanity Fair Oscar bash and their militarized security with micro chipped cards.  If your name was not on the list and you were carrying an Oscar, you could walk in.  Billy and Janice Crystal were mobbed with well-wishers. Elton John made $5 million dollars at his 20th AmFar event which also auctioned off two tickets to Vanity Fair’s party    for $230 thousand dollars. Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes were thrilled to talk to George Lucas. Gwyneth snuggled with Coldplay's Chris Martin and Jennifer Lopez brought boy-toy Casper Smart. Every major actor previously mentioned was standing in the room.     In a sea of celebrity were Tina Fey, David Beckham, Glenn Close,       Terry George, Demian Bichir, Claire Danes, Meryl's daughters Mamie Gummer with husband Ben Walker,   Grace Gummer, Salma Hayek, Brit Marling, Natalie Portman, Sofia Coppola, Ryan Kavanaugh, Ingrid Sischy, Sandy Brant and Wendi Murdoch with Bingbing Li.    




George Clooney threw his own exclusive    party at Craig's in West Hollywood for close friends Bryan Lourd, Grant Heslov, Stan Rosenfield, Brad and Angelina, Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, Cindy Crawford, Jimmy Kimmel, Ryan Seacrest and best adapted screenplay winner Alexander Payne.  As much as George supported The Descendants he and Brad seemed to have cancelled each other out this year with two great performances.



“The French” and their closest 200 threw their own wild celebration at the Chateau, poured champagne down their throats and threw each other in the pool at 3:00am. Nobody spoke a word of English.



By 4:00am Harvey rounded his talent up for a live broadcast on The Today Show from The Four Seasons lobby. In disheveled black tie five Oscar winners and Berenice Bejo, who were total unknowns a year ago made Oscar history with the first silent film to win since 1927.  This had to be the most exciting night of their lives. Tomorrow they all go back to reality but the glory and the memories will live on forever. As an Oscar winner, who cares about a cold?  



Uggie was invited to the White House correspondent’s dinner as a guest of the Washington Times in April. He hopes to meet President Obama.

23 Ordinary Slavic People That Look Just Like Famous Celebrities

Slavorum is a Facebook page that documents the culture, history, and events of Slavic culture. This time they collected a

series of pictures of ordinary Slavic people and paired them with their celebrity counterparts. We’re pretty sure they

the experience that this man had had working as an economic advisor
in the White House. The students played that role in the simulation
and learned how economics is used in the real world.

All of this is really beside the point, however. I learned, during
these conversations, that at Columbia calculus is required in order to
be an economics major. I wondered about this, since the courses we
were building never had any complicated math in them, so it seemed
that calculus wasn’t something that came up regularly in real-world
economics.

I asked and was told that my observation was right and that cal-
culus was required in order to ensure that there wouldn’t be too many
economics majors. As an insider in the university world, I understood
this remark, but it needs some explaining for outsiders.

Columbia doesn’t have an undergraduate business major. And, in
New York City there are a lot of students interested in business. Colum-
bia and other Ivy League schools think that business isn’t an academic
subject, so students shouldn’t learn it until they go to graduate school.
Columbia does have a well-respected business school, but, as I pointed
out, no one really wants to teach undergraduates so they certainly
aren’t lobbying to teach them. (This is also true of medical schools and
law schools and it is why you never see courses for undergraduates in
those fields despite the evident interest of the undergraduates.)

So, potential businesspeople at Columbia need to major in some-
thing and economics seems to them to be a reasonable second choice.
(I am not really sure that it is a good choice but these are 18-year-olds
making these decisions.) Thus, the Economics Department is flood-
ed with potential majors. This seems like it would be a good thing,
doesn’t it? Students want to study what you teach. Isn’t that good?

Well, not really.

Let us assume we have an economics faculty of 20 people, each of
whom teaches three courses a year. So we can offer 60 courses. Sounds
like a good number. But this has to include graduate seminars, and
the faculty will be lobbying to have more of these and more advanced
courses where they can teach their own specialty, as I have said. But
majors need courses too. They might need 20 or more. This doesn’t
leave a lot for introductory courses unless the department runs enor-
mous lecture courses that have hundreds of students. Now depart-
ments know that such courses are pretty awful things and they try to
keep them down to a dull roar. But if you have hundreds of students
wanting to take your courses, and you were set up with just enough

underage girls. (Upon information and belief, the young girl
who brought Jane Doe to Epstein was herself a minor victim
of Epstein, and will therefore not be named in this Com-
plaint.) Under Epstein’s plan, underage girls were recruited
ostensibly to give a wealthy man a massage for monetary
compensation in his Palm Beach mansion. The recruiter
would be contacted when Epstein was planning to be at his
Palm Beach residence or soon after he had arrived there.
Epstein or someone on his behalf would direct the recruiter
to bring one or more underage girls to the residence. The
recruiter, upon information and belief, generally sought out
economically disadvantaged underaged girls from western
Palm Beach County who would be enticed by the money
being offered—generally $200 to $300 per “massage”
session —and who were perceived as less likely to complain
to authorities or have credibility if allegations of improper
conduct were made. This was an important element of
Epstein’s plan.

Epstein’s plan reflected a particular pattern and method.
Upon arrival at Epstein’s mansion, the underaged victim
would be introduced to Sarah Kellen, Epstein’s assistant, who
gathered the girl’s personal information, including her name
and telephone number. Ms. Kellen would then bring the girl
up a flight of stairs to a bedroom that contained a massage
table in addition to other furnishings. There were photo-
graphs of nude women lining the stairway hall and in the
bedroom. The girl would then find herself alone in the room
with Epstein, who would be wearing only a towel. He would
then remove his towel and lie naked on the massage table,
and direct the girl to remove her clothes. Epstein would then

from newspapers, wire services, foreign publications, radio and TV.

“What's the meaning of it?” one editor asked me. “There's a lot of excitement at the city

desk.”
“That is the meaning of it.”

A few years later, without my permission, Jules Siegel, the editor of a short-lived
magazine, Cheetah, published a fake obituary of me. I thought it was funny. An Associated Press

reporter called, and I explained that it was a hoax.
“Are you sure?” he asked.
“Of course. I would tell you if I was dead.”

Siegel started writing for Cavalier. His first assignment was a profile of Sterling Hayden, an actor

best known in Dr, Stranglove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.

Journalist Adam Ellsworth described Siegel’s “Goodbye Surfing, Hello God” with his most
famous example of rock journalism, but his most revolutionary was his article, “The Big Beat.”
It appeared in the Playboy-esque Cavalier magazine in 1965 and was one of the earliest writings
he’d ever seen on the development of rock and roll, from slaves singing in chains on their way to

America to Bob Dylan “going electric” at the Newport Folk Festival.

Then Jules’ friend, Arthur Kretchmer, became Cavalier’s managing editor. “When the editorial
director later resigned,” Kretchmer said, “there was a 24-hour hiatus before the new editor
arrived.” Siegel and Kretchmer had been discussing the possibility of publishing an issue on rock
and roll, so to make it happen, Kretchmer went into the office at night and retyped the magazine’s

schedule to include their ideas.

When the new editorial started, Kretchmer handed him the schedules and said, “Here’s what
we’re working on.” The new editorial director suspected nothing and the rock and roll issue went

ahead. Once the laughter died down, Jules talked for a good 25 minutes about

finally taking control of their own destiny. It was a message that took on an
even greater power and poignancy after the mass murder of the Jews of Europe
during the Holocaust.

Even for many Israelis nowadays, the all-consuming collectivism of life on
an early kibbutz, and the physical challenges, are hard to imagine. Among the
few dozen families in Mishmar Hasharon when I was born, there was no private
property. Everything was communally owned and allocated. Every penny — or
Israeli pound — earned from what we produced went into a communal kitty,
from which each one of the 150-or-so families in Mishmar Hasharon when I
was a child got a small weekly allowance. By “small”, I mean tiny. For my
parents and others, even the idea of an ice cream cone for their children was a
matter of keen financial planning. More often, they would save each weekly
pittance with the aim of pooling them at birthday time, where they might stretch
to the price of a picture book, or a small toy.

Decisions on any issue of importance were taken at the aseifa, the weekly
meeting of kibbutz members held on Saturday nights in our dining hall. The
agenda would be tacked up on the wall the day before, and the session would
usually focus on one issue, ranging from major items like the kibbutz’s finances
to the question, for instance, of whether our small platoon of delivery drivers
should be given pocket money to buy a sandwich or a coffee on their days
outside the kibbutz or be limited to wrapping up bits of the modest fare on offer
at breakfast time. That debate ended in a classic compromise: a bit of money,
but very little, so as to avoid violating the egalitarian ethos of the kibbutz.

But perhaps the aspect of life on the kibbutz most difficult for outsiders to
understand, especially nowadays, is that we children were raised collectively.
We lived in dormitories, organized by age-group and overseen by a caregiver:
in Hebrew, a metapelet, usually a woman in her 20s or 30s. For a few hours
each afternoon and on the Jewish Sabbath, we were with our parents. But
otherwise, we lived and learned in a world consisting almost entirely of other
children.

Everything around us was geared towards making us feel like a band of
brothers and sisters, and as part of the guiding spirit of the kibbutz. Until our
teenage years, we weren’t even graded in school. And though we didn’t actually
study how to till the land, some of my fondest early memories are of our
“children’s farm” — the vegetables we grew, the cows we milked, the hens and
chickens that gave us our first experience of how life was created. And the

cans would be on board. /d. Finally, the
court reasoned that the “interest of the
United States in preventing and punishing
international terrorism has been a matter
of worldwide common knowledge for
years.” Jd. (citing statutes criminalizing
terrorist acts). “It logically follows that if
federal courts may constitutionally exer-
cise criminal jurisdiction over such individ-
uals, the Constitution should be no bar to
those same federal courts, in a civil action

. exercising civil im personam jurisdic-
tion over those same individuals for the
same acts.” Id.

[44] The courts in Rein, Daltberti, and
Pugh properly exercised personal jurisdic-
tion over each of the defendants in those
cases pursuant to the FSIA, which specifi-
cally provides that personal jurisdiction ex-
ists where proper service and subject mat-
ter jurisdiction have been established. 28
U.S.C. § 1830(b); Rein, 995 F.Supp. at
329-30; Daliberti, 97 F.Supp.2d at 52;
Pugh, 290 F.Supp.2d at 58. While the
FSIA is not the basis for personal jurisdic-
tion here, jurisdiction based on the ATA or
Rule 4(k)(2) also requires minimum con-
tacts with the United States. Accordingly,
Plaintiffs may rely on their “purposefully
directed” theory to establish these mini-
mum contacts. But as existed in Burger
King, Calder, and the three terrorism
cases, Plaintiffs must allege some personal
or direct involvement by the Defendants in
the conduct giving rise to their claims.
See, eg. Daliberti, 97 F.Supp.2d at 41
(explaining that defendant Iraq had held
and tortured plaintiffs and that three of
four plaintiffs were released only after
U.S. officials’ explicit negotiations with
their Iraqi counterparts); Pugh, 290
F.Supp.2d at 56 (noting that seven individ-
ual Libyan defendants were sued in the
United States after extensive official
French investigation and that these defen-
dants were deemed to be responsible for

the bombings in both civil and criminal
proceedings); see also In re Magnetic Au-
diotape, 334 F.3d at 208 (2d (stating a
“court may exercise personal jurisdiction
over defendant consistent with due process
when defendant is primary participant in
intentional wrongdoing—albeit extraterri-
torially—expressly directed at forum”)
(citing Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. at 789-90,
104 S.Ct. 1482)); Time, Inc. v. Sumpson,
No. 02 Civ. 49170MBM), 2003 WL
23018890, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 22, 2003)
(finding Calder turned on “personal in-
volvement of the individual defendants in
the particular conduct that gave rise to the
plaintiffs claim” and granting motion to
dismiss because plaintiff had not demon-
strated that defendant had had any per-
sonal involvement in the events giving rise
to the lawsuit). Accordingly, regardless of
whether personal jurisdiction is based on
the ATA’s nationwide service of process
provision or Rule 4(k)@), to satisfy the
Fifth Amendment’s due process require-
ments, Plaintiffs must make a prima facie
showing of each Defendant’s personal or
direct participation in the conduct giving
rise to Plaintiffs’ injuries.

3. Mass Torts Theory

[45] In addition to the arguments ar-
ticulated above, the Federal Plaintiffs sub-
mit that the Court should utilize a modi-
fied due process standard appropriate for
mass torts. See, e.g., Federal Prince Turki
Opp. at 23; Federal Prince Mohammed
Opp. at 12; SAAR Network Opp. at 12-13.
Courts in the Eastern District of New
York have outlined the modified standard
in products liability cases as follows: the
state’s interests in the litigation replace
contacts with the forum as the constitu-
tional touchstone and the “reasonableness”
inquiry is replaced with a hardship analy-

becoming inactive, but the effects of
loneliness were independent of changes
in health status. Similarly, individuals
with fewer social connections (i.e., a
smaller social network) were less likely
to be physically active, but the effects of
loneliness on physical activity did not
depend on the size of the social network.
The invisible force of loneliness seems
to play a unique role in this particular
predisease pathway.

Another commonly cited risk
factor for disease is stress. In reality,
“stress” refers to a family of predisease
pathways, each of which may be
vulnerable to the influence of lonely
feelings. Loneliness is itself a source of
stress, but lonely individuals also differ
in their exposure to stressful events and
circumstances. This is less evident in
young adults than it is in older adults in
whom loneliness was associated with
having experienced a greater number of
stressful life events in the past year (e.g.,
death in the family, marital crisis,
change in employment status) and more
sources of chronic stress (e.g.,
employment stress, marital stress).° In
addition, lonely individuals perceive life
as more stressful and less gratifying than
their socially connected counterparts,
even when objective indications are that
lonely and nonlonely individuals do not
differ in the types of activities and
behaviors they engage in on a daily
basis. Good quality social interactions
typically ameliorate feelings of stress,
but because lonely people perceive their
interactions to be less positive than those
of nonlonely people, they fail to derive
the same benefit. Good coping strategies
can also ameliorate feelings of stress, but
lonely individuals are more likely to
respond to stress with pessimism and
avoidance than with optimism and active

engagement. And to add insult to injury,
loneliness increases sensitivity to and
surveillance for social threats. Anxiety,
low self-esteem, and fear of negative
evaluation elicit self-defensive behaviors
and effectively tax cognitive resources
that would normally be available to meet
the demands of daily life stress. Thus,
what might naively be thought of as a
circumscribed problem—the feeling of
loneliness and isolation—may be seen
by the sufferer as a world of inescapable
threat.’

How might these cognitions and
perceptions influence physiology and
health? As Berntson shows in his
chapter, the brain regions involved in
emotional and perceptual processes are
intimately related to brain regions
involved in the regulation of
physiological systems. This is
particularly evident in alterations of the
functioning of the cardiovascular system
in lonely individuals. In young adults,
this alteration is apparent in increased
resistance to blood flow in small arteries
throughout the body. Increased vascular
resistance is a precursor and
predominant contributor to age-related
increases in systolic blood pressure
(SBP), a major risk factor for
cardiovascular disease. In middle-aged
adults, SBP is significantly higher in
lonely adults than in their nonlonely
counterparts. Moreover, loneliness
accelerates the rate of increases in SBP,*
indicating a faster decline in
physiological resilience and a heightened
risk for chronic cardiovascular disease.
It’s as though loneliness accelerates the
aging process.

By virtue of extensive
interconnections among the brain,
peripheral nervous systems, and
endocrine glands, the feelings of
isolation and loneliness have a broad and

Dear Joi, 
Hello, I'm writing from Politico Magazine, where we're working on a special package of stories timed to Donald Trump's 
inauguration in January, and I wondered if you would be interested in contributing. 
As he prepares to take office, our plan is to publish a handful of out-of-the box ideas for President Trump, suggested by 
writers and thinkers from a variety of fields and ideological positions. Whether the idea has to do with politics, policy, 
personnel or governing style, we're looking for suggestions that are specific and, above all, surprising; something inventive if 
slightly far-fetched is better than a pet cause or a well-trod policy proposal. (This exercise doesn't require that you support or 
even agree with Trump, but it does require a willingness to engage.) 
Do you have an idea along these lines that you wish the new president would consider, whether something in economics or 
otherwise? If so, I'd love to hear, and we can discuss next steps from there. Ultimately, we're aiming to publish a handful of 
short pieces (about 800 words each) as a package of proposals. 
Many thanks, and please let me know if you have questions.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012825.txt,"liking part company, with liking falling dormant due to sensitization, wanting grows in intensity, seeking

but failing to find satisfaction. So begins an appetite for violence, one that can turn into a craving.

A craving to impress

Gazelles on the Serengeti plains of Tanzania sometimes move in an exceptionally bizarre way. With legs
rigidly extended, they bounce up and down like kangaroos. There is no obvious function associated with
this movement. If anything, it appears energetically wasteful. If these gazelles lived in tall grass, one
might think that the bouncing was designed to better see or be seen. But the Serengeti plains are flat and
the grass is short. Gazelles can see for miles in this habitat and so can everything else that shares this
gorgeous part of the planet with them. This includes the lions, leopards and cheetah that think of gazelles
as breakfast, lunch and dinner. Why would a gazelle advertise like this? Why alert predators to your
location and availability? Why not use the coloration of your fur to blend into the color scheme of the
savannah, moving swiftly but imperceptibly?

We can explain the gazelle’s bizarre movements — called stotting — by thinking economically,
using Zahavi’s honest signaling theory that I described in Chapter 1. Whenever evolutionary biologists
see a behavior that is costly, they immediately search for a potential benefit. The reason is simple:
behaviors that tax an individual's chances of survival and reproduction are ultimately weeded out by the
force of natural selection. There must be some benefit to the individual or to others in order to neutralize
the costs. Given the ostentatious nature of the gazelle’s stotting, who benefits and how? Since the
behavior is eye-poppingly interesting to human observers, one assumes that it is eye-popping to other
animals on the Serengeti plains as well. Gazelles typically stot when they detect danger which, in the
Serengeti, means leopards, lions and cheetah. If gazelles stot to alert other gazelles, then most gazelles
should stot, at least some of the time. This is because all gazelles are vigilant, should have multiple
opportunities to see these predatory cats, and should benefit from an alarm signal. But this is not what we
observe. Instead, stotting seems to be reserved for those in good shape. When gazelles stot, they appear to
be sending a cease and desist signal to any observant cat. If this is the gazelles’ message, then cats should
selectively chase non-stotters over stotters. And when cats turn a blind eye to stotting gazelles and chase
them, they should have less success than when they chase non-stotters. Stotters are turbo-charged.
Stotting is simply their way of showing off.

These expectations are supported by the British biologists Claire Fitzgibbon and Tim Caro who
spent hundreds of hours watching gazelles and predatory cats. What they reveal is that stotting is an

honest signal of condition or quality. Only gazelles in good condition can tolerate the costs of stotting.

Y, such that X is preferred to Y although Y confers the higher fitness. This preference ordering

Ravages of denial

Self denial is not a virtue: it is only the effect of prudence on rascality.
-- George Bernard Shaw

In October of 1980, a 39 year old man walked into the Royal Melbourne Hospital in Australia, having
suffered a gun shot to the left side of his skull. Once the medical team removed the bullet fragments and
cleared the blood clot, the man was able to speak. He had shot himself, aiming at his second head. Yes,
his second head. This man believed that he had two heads, his own and the head of his dead wife’s
gynecologist. Before his wife died in a car accident, he believed that she was having an affair with her
gynecologist. At night, the second head spoke, accompanied by voices from Jesus and Abraham who
confirmed the existence of the second head. As the patient expressed to the interviewing doctor “The
other head kept trying to dominate my normal head, and I would not let it. It kept trying to say to me I
would lose, and I said bull-shit.” “I am the king pin here” it said and it kept going on like that for about
three weeks and finally I got jack of it, and I decided to shoot my other head off.” Over a two year period,
the perception of the second head disappeared. The attending neuropsychologist, David Ames, described
the case as an example of schizophrenia-induced delusional bicephaly — a distortion of reality that
creates a false belief of two heads.

Cases like this are bizarre. But like many neuropsychological reports, they force us to reevaluate
our perception of reality, what’s normal and what’s distorted, what’s adaptive and what’s maladaptive.
The Australian patient who developed delusional bicephaly was suffering from the loss of his wife. Loss
and suffering motivate explanation, along with something or someone to blame: Was it really an
accident? Why her? Why not me? What if she had stayed home that morning? What if I had been driving
with her? Was she distracted by her lover? Was he in the car? These questions represent gaps in a
narrative, holes that we attempt to fill, often by distorting reality.

Distortions of reality are common. Even the healthiest among us create stories designed to

- I've been watching closely Trump's appointees and there, he might be putting Balaji (a big

of course, Thiel has said that Bitcoin is what Paypal should have been... Curious to hear where 
your head is at on this matter. 
- Last week, I presented my research at Stanford's BPASE, it was well received. The most 
interesting thing I came up with for that is an inverse-input contract; i.e., funds that are locked to 
be spent only in the case where there are other funds that are not used in a specific way. An 
example of something that could be built with this: a matching donation contract, where you agree 
to donate your money to charity if someone else donates to charity, and you would not be able to 
release your funds from that agreement until they use their funds not for charity. 
- I'm in Japan this week, teaching a class to 100 Japanese Engineers to get the up to speed on 
bitcoin (with DG). It's very interesting to see the trepidation first hand that they have with respect to 
the technology, despite their debit-based society being more geared for it in any case (DG felt that 
even putting Bitcoin in the course name would scare away students). One of my friends (a hedge 
fund manager) told me that female japanese engineers are very good, and drastically under-
valued. I made sure to get a few invited to the class, we'll see if he's right. On the whole, it will be 
interesting to see the caliber of engineer Japan has to offer on this front.

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024931.txt,"This is the second time that I have responded to your questions online; the first time was eight years ago, when
Internet communications were still in the nascent stage -- although, I must say, Dubai and the United Arab
Emirates had already made noteworthy progress in this field. During that initial online interview, my objective
was to stimulate the interest of the Emirati community in the Internet when the use of the online
communications was relatively limited.

Today the usage of the Internet across the UAE has come to be taken for granted; in fact, the Web has been
adopted so extensively in both the public and private sectors that e-communications are the norm rather than the
exception. We see that a large segment of our society, especially young people, believe that the Internet is the
most important source of information, education and entertainment.

The UAE continues to lead the Arab world in adoption of information and communication technology
according to the annual global infor mation technology report released before yesterday.

Little wonder, then, that I get inundated with questions from citizens and media alike. That’s why I have chosen
to meet with you via my Web site. I think hosting this encounter online will allow all of you to ask as many
questions as you wish. In the last few days alone, I have received hundreds of questions from several local and
regional newspapers. Naturally, there was some overlapping of questions since they came from so many
different sources. Hence, I have tried to consolidate my answers in such a manner that I do not come across as
repetitious.

This “interview,” of course, relates to questions from the media, whose work I consider especially significant in
telling the story of how Dubai and the UAE are coping successfully with the global financial crisis, and how our
development plans are being advanced with the resilience and determination that has always characterized
Emirati society.

I have also received many questions from everyday Emiratis, and these will be answered in a subsequent
communication.

In the meantime, I hope my responses will generate positive discussion about the issues and values that Dubai
and the UAE care about — the strengthening ofa society that’s anchored in unique Emirati traditions, and the
continued building of a global city to which all are welcome, a city that is well integrated in the fast changing
global commons that we all must share. Dubai is not only a catalyst of change; it is an exemplar of change. And
I am proud of that, just as Iam proud of the economic and social contributions that Emiratis and their well-
wishers have made over these years to furthering the Dubai Vision.

Al Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi

Your Highness, Dubai, the famous city known for its outstanding experience on both
regional and international levels, has been recently criticized for its development
strategy in the light of the global financial crisis. How do you perceive this campaign and
how are you dealing with it?

Criticism and negative statements do not really disturb me. We do not mind receiving objective criticism that
helps us improving our services and methods. If there were negative aspects, then we will address them and
work toward revamping them. But following the global financial crisis, what we read and heard was not in
reference to the negative aspects. In fact it was a media bombardment targeted at the UAE as a model for a
federal state, a successful and prosperous Arab country. And Dubai, the city that has set up a successful
economic model at a global level, was under a daily attack by some Western media, as if they were in a race
against time to harm the UAE.

As for the motives of the campaign, God Almighty knows. But it seems that the success of the Arab, whether

because this was less than nine months before I was born, my mother always
remained vague when asked their exact wedding date.

My parents were an unlikely pair. My mother — bright, lively and energetic —
was a doer, who believed passionately in the grand social experiment of kibbutz
life. Having helped her mother raise her siblings in Warsaw, and with a natural
affinity from children, she became the main authority on issues related to
childbirth and early childcare. She actively partook in the kibbutz’s planning
and politics, and reveled in its social life. My father was more detached both
politically and socially. He was more contemplative, less assertive, less self-
confident. Though he agreed broadly with the founding principles of the
kibbutz, and wanted to play his role in making it a success, I could see, as I
grew older, that he was often impatient at what he saw as its intellectual
insularity and its ideological rigidities.

Though it didn’t strike me at the time, he was not a large man. As a result of
his childhood illness, he never grew to more than five-foot-four. Still, he was a
powerful presence, stocky and strong from his work on the kibbutz. He had a
deep, resonant voice and wise-looking, blue-gray eyes. It was only through
Uncle Meir that by the time I was born, he had moved on from driving a tractor
to a more influential role on the kibbutz. Meir worked for the Palestine Electric
Company and when Mishmar Hasharon installed its own electricity system, the
PEC was in charge of the work. Meir trained my father and put him forward as
the kibbutz contact for maintaining and repairing the equipment. He was well
suited for the work. He was a natural tinkerer, a problem-solver. He was good
with his hands, and his natural caution was an additional asset as the kibbutz got
to grips with the potential, and the potential dangers, of electric power. Once the
system was installed, he became responsible for managing any aspect of the
settlement that involved electricity: water pumps, the irrigation system, the
communal laundry and our bakery.

My parents were courteous and polite with each other, but they never
showed any physical affection in our presence. None of the adults did. This was
part of an unspoken kibbutz code. Not only for kibbutzniks, but for all the early
Zionists, outward displays of emotion were seen as a kind of selfishness that
risked undermining communal cohesion, tenacity and strength. Because I’d
known no other way, this did not strike me as odd. Besides, I was a quiet,
contemplative, bookish and self-contained child. Only in later years did I come to
see the lasting effect on me. It was be a long time before I became comfortable

Egypt worse off, but it could further weaken the economy as revenue from
key industries, such as tourism, continues to decline. It would not improve
conditions either, as improvements, unfortunately, take longer that the
voting public generally likes. The potential upshot of this option is that,
hopefully, over time, mass action would become more and more cohesive
and leaders start to emerge from the morass. This would bring developed
political parties into Egypt’s political system and potentially, leaders from
outside the military and the elite as well. This, however, will remain only a
temporary option. Revolutions, or even mass action, are difficult to
maintain over time. Moreover, if some improvements, particularly
economic improvements, do occur, the majority of the country will
acquiesce to a nondemocratic government. The best example of this is the
Chinese government, which has managed economic growth without any
accompanying political liberalization. Eventually, either a government
will improve conditions for the average Egyptian, or it will become so
repressive that mass action ceases to be a viable option. The third option is
a total crackdown on any and all political movements and the return of a
repressive and autocratic government. The impetus behind this path is the
idea that establishing stability is the first and foremost priority of the
government. If you establish stability, the rest will follow. Or, if the
government is truly cynical, it simply does not care what happens as long
as the ruler and his or her cronies are taken care of. Right now, it looks as
though Egypt has chosen to go with option three, the return to repression
under military rule. The first step for any autocracy is to get a firm grip on
the political process, weeding out the opposition. This is precisely what

has been occurring. Massive repression of the Muslim Brotherhood is the
most obvious example of this process. While there are some legitimate

security concerns regarding the Muslim Brotherhood ties to ongoing
violence, banning the entire organization and labeling them all as terrorists
is like using a sledgehammer on a nail—overkill and likely to create a
mess. It does, however, have the benefit of getting the only meaningful
political party out of the current political scene and that is a key step in
political consolidation. Other examples of consolidation abound, including

With respect to Prince Sultan’s and
Prince Turki's arguments that the entire
tort, meaning both the tortious conduct
and the injury, must occur in the United
States, Judge Robertson disagreed and
stated the FSIA “preserves immunity for
tort claims unless injury or death occurs in

Inbyan Arab Republic, 726 F.2d 774, 775
(D.C.Cir.1984)) (Edwards, J., concurring)
(some emphasis omitted). Courts in the
Second Circuit seem to take the opposite
approach. “Although cast in terms that
may be read to require that only the injury
rather than the tortious acts occur in the
United States, the Supreme Court has
held that this exception ‘covers only torts
occurring within the territorial jurisdiction
of the United States.” Cabiri v. Govt of
the Republic of Ghana, 165 F.3d 198, 200
n. 3 (2d Cir.1999) (quoting Amerada Hess,

culty. Although he did consider Plaintiffs’s
claims under the tort exception, he found that
the language of the state sponsor of terrorism
exception buttressed his ultimate conclusion
that the tortious acts exception would not
provide subject matter jurisdiction over
Prince Sultan and Prince Turki. Unlike
(a)(7), the tort exception “makes no mention
of the ‘provision of material support.’”’ Bur-
nett IT, 292 F.Supp.2d at 20 n. 5. After review-

States because “the entire tort must be
committed in the United States”).

Plaintiffs allege that the Kingdom,
Prince Sultan, and Prince Turki tortiously
aided and abetted the September 11 ter-
rorists by supporting charities that, in
turn, supported al Qaeda and international
terrorism. Plaintiffs also claim that, in
return for protection of the Kingdom,
these Defendants essentially willfully ig-
nored the threat that Osama bin Laden
and al Qaeda posed to the United States.
Plaintiffs do not claim that the Kingdom or
the Princes undertook any of their alleged
acts in the United States. Yet, in the
Plaintiffs’ view, the operative torts for the
Court’s consideration are the attacks of
September 11, which did take place in the
United States. See Burnett If, 292
F.Supp.2d at 19 n. 4 (noting death and
injuries occurred in United States). Fur-
ther, Plaintiffs claim it would be unjust to
allow foreign nations to escape liability for
tortious acts performed in the United
States if they could show that some act of
planning the tort took place outside the
United States.

Additionally, Defendants submit that,
since the allegations are precisely those
outlined in § 1605(a)(7)—that is, “personal
injury or death that was caused by an act
of ... extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabo-
tage ... or the provision of material sup-
port or resources ... for such an act?—
none of the other exceptions should be
read to apply in its place.” Defendants

a statute but omits it from another, Judge
Robertson concluded that Congress’s omis-

Mary: July 2006

n June 29, assistant state attorney Lanna Belohlavek told
Detective Recarey that despite his protestations, the case
would be going to a grand jury after all. One had been
convened for July 19.
On July 12, Recarey spoke with Mary’s stepmother, who said
» that she still hadn’t heard from the state attorney’s office. This,
| too, was odd, since Recarey knew that Mary would be called
q upon to testify.
___ She was back in Palm Beach now, after months of living with
j out-of-state relatives.
All in all, it had been a very tough year for Mary.
___-What has happened to my daughter’s life is criminal,” her
1 ather would say.
Mary had been sent to a school for troubled children. For
her it was the wrong place at the worst time in her life. She had

single man who triumphs over adversity.

The Governor’s ball, held above the Kodak Theater, recreates the Mocambo-Ciro’s niteries of the 1930’s
and 40’s, using a palette of teal and white. Three bands alternate musical styles as hungry guests wolf
down wolfgang Puck’s delicious food. The winners triumphantly sachet around the room holding their heavy
eight pound gold statues.

An hour later there is a migration to the famous Vanity Fair party hosted by Graydon Carter at the Sunset
Tower Hotel owned by Jeff Klein. One celebrity after another poses in front of the green hedge standing
in the middle of the circular Vanity Fair logo to record their devotion and support to Graydon and the
magazine.

There’s a hierarchy of arrival times. The inner circle of Graydon’s 150 best friends attend a seated
dinner and viewing of the show at 5pm. They include Barry Diller and Diane Von Furstenberg, Francis Ford
Coppola, Jon Hamm and Jennifer westfeldt, Betsey Bloomingdale, Tory Burch and Lyor Cohen, Tom Ford, Sandy
Gallin, Mitch Glazer and Kelly Lynch, Carolina and Reinaldo Herrera, L’Wren Scott and Sir Mick Jagger,
Naomi Watts and Live Schreiber, Wendi Stark, Judd Apatow, Jackie and Joan Collins, George Hammilton,
Donna Karan and Steve Martin.

The best and the brightest talent in town arrive at 9pm. They are Justin Bieber and his date Selena
Gomez, Andrew Garfield, Jude Law, Vera Farmiga, Armie Hammer, Jennifer Lawrence, Kevin Spacey, Charlize
Theron, Anne Hathaway, Hailee Steinfield,Taylor Hackford and Helen Mirren, Scarlett Johansson, Michelle
williams, Isla Fischer and Sasha Baron Cohen, Jane Fonda after her play, “33 Variations”, Melania and
Donald Trump whom I introduce to David 0. Russell as The Trumpster gushes about “The Fighter”. Donald
offers me a ride home on his plane. He is leaving in ten minutes. Too bad James Franco didn’t know
because he is presently sitting on a commercial flight back to school, skipping his own after party.
Social standings of the rest of the guests are determined by half hour increments. Every other person
previously mentioned in the story is here. VF’s Beth Kseniak and Matt Ullian tell me the list is cut down
to 800 this year.

At 11:30pm there is another celebrity migration up the hill to Madonna manager Guy Oseary’s house. One
should note that earlier in the evening Madonna came down the hill to pose in a risqué outfit with
daughter Lourdes in front of the green hedge. Madonna and co-host Demi Moore are able to lure the créme
de la créme with the promise of fabulous music, dancing and no cameras. Those reported on their dance
floor include Ryan Phillippe with Amanda Syedfried, who were making out all night and Phillippe’s ex-wife
Reese Witherspoon and new fiancé Jim Toth. They pregnant Natalie Portman and choreographer Benjamin
Millepied, Mick Jagger, Tom Hanks, Sean Penn, Ralph Feinnes, Mila Kunis, Cameron Diaz, Gwyneth Paltrow
and Renee Zellweger and Bradley Cooper boogie til dawn.

A winner’s work is never done. Colin Firth, Tom Hooper and David Seidler show up at 4:30am at The Four
Seasons Hotel for a live broadcast on The Today Show with Meredith Vieira. Functioning on an adrenalin
rush, they are back at the Kodak Theater with Geoffrey Rush to appear on Oprah’s live broadcast. Leave it
to Oprah to get the king’s last words.

Whereas the defunct two state solution was proposed in 1947, when
the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 181 calling for dividing
historic Palestine into two entities and for granting Jerusalem an
international status, the reversal of this resolution by the Assembly is
imperative. Although not legally binding, this resolution did grant
legitimacy to the creation of the State of Israel. Ironically, since that
resolution, there was no serious discussion concerning the
establishment of two states in Palestine until the 1991 Madrid
Conference and the signing of the Oslo Accords (Declaration of
Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements) in Washington
in 1993. Except for a few euphoric, but short-lived moments, not the
slightest progress has been made towards granting the Palestinians
statehood, and all attempts to establish two states have failed.

We propose that neutral member states should ask the UN General
Assembly to rescind Resolution 181 and to request a new resolution
for the establishment of one state in historic Palestine. Although this
responsibility falls under the Security Council, the constant exercise
by the US of its veto power to protect Israel against condemnations
and sanctions has proven the council's ineffectiveness in dealing
objectively with the Arab-Israeli conflict.

At the General Assembly, each state has an equal voting right, thus
lending legitimacy to passed resolutions. In its deliberations, the
Assembly should also address international law and human rights
violations committed by Israel, the PA, and neighbouring states
against the Palestinian people, and set a course for a new beginning
in the Middle East through major shifts in the paradigms that have
crippled the region for decades.

A resolution for establishing one democratic state in historic
Palestine will include as citizens all those who live there and all
Palestinians in the Diaspora, reaffirming Palestinian refugees right to
return, and acknowledging the special place that Palestine is for

illiberal governments in countries like Hungary
for their rejection of international democratic
standards in favor of perceived national inter-
ests. Even when there is no direct collaboration,
such behavior benefits authoritarian powers by
breaking down the unity and solidarity of the
democratic world.

¢ There has been arise in authoritarian inter-
nationalism. Authoritarian powers form loose
but effective alliances to block criticism at the
United Nations and regional organizations like
the Organization for Security and Co-operation
in Europe and the Organization of American
States, and to defend embattled allies like Syria's
Bashar al-Assad. There is also growing replica-
tion of what might be called authoritarian best
practices, vividly on display in the new Chinese
law on nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)
and efforts by Russia and others to learn from
China's experience in internet censorship.

Modern authoritarians are working to revalidate
the concept of the leacer-for-life. One of the
seeming gains of the postcommunist era was
the understanding that some form of term limits
should be imposed to prevent incumbents from
consolidating power into a dictatorship. In re-
cent years, however, a number of countries have
adjusted their constitutions to ease, eliminate,
or circumvent executive term limits. The result
has been a resurgence of potential leaders-for-
life from Latin America to Eurasia.

While more subtle and calibrated methods of re-
pression are the defining feature of modern au-
thoritarianism, the past few years have featured
a reemergence of older tactics that undermine
the illusions of pluralism and openness as well
as integration with the global economy. Thus
Moscow has pursued its military intervention in
Ukraine despite economic sanctions and over-
seen the assassination of opposition figures;

In taking his case to Washington, Mr. Aliyev has variously sought safe passage to the United States, help in 
recovering $2 billion that relatives claimed they lost from seized businesses, or at least the satisfaction of 
embarrassing Mr. Nazarbayev. For his part, the Kazakh leader wants to make sure that the Americans stay out 
of the dispute, and not allow it to affect their alliance with his government. 
The Obama administration has done just that. Through comments in secret diplomatic cables, the former 
ambassador to Kazakhstan made clear his wariness of being drawn in. 
Both sides — the government and Aliyev — seek to manipulate us to their own advantage, Richard E. 
Hoagland, who ended his term as United States ambassador early this year, wrote in February 2009 in one of 
more than a dozen State Department cables obtained by the antisecrecy group WikiLeaks that mentioned the 
dispute. [*] 
Mr. Nazarbayev, 70, [*]a former steel worker and Soviet-era Communist Party leader, has been in power for 
two decades, presiding over Central Asia's most vibrant economy. Human rights activists, however, have 
long accused him of persecuting dissidents and political opponents. 
Mr. Aliyev, 48, [*]has served as chief of the tax police, deputy foreign affairs minister and head of the 
Kazakh equivalent of the K.G.B. But critics say he used his clout to secretly take over private companies for 
financial gain, often by threatening violence. 
Now hiding somewhere in Europe, he has been convicted back home on what he claims are trumped-up 
criminal charges, including a coup attempt. His wife divorced him in June 2007, and the Kazakh government 
has taken businesses owned by him and members of his extended family. [*] 
No longer powerful at home, Mr. Aliyev turned to Washington, knowing that his former father-in-law cared 
greatly about his reputation there. 
Early in 2008 he hired RJI Government Strategies, a small Washington lobbying group whos 
e consultants 
included Tanya Rahall, sister of Representative Nick J. Rahall II, a West Virginia Democrat; and a friend of 
Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California. Both congressmen were booked on a trip to Kazakhstan 
to discuss energy policy with Mr. Nazarbayev. 
Before their departure, members of___________________________to urge him to express strong concerns about the 
harm done to a relative of Mr. Aliyev named Devincci Hourani, whose oil-company assets in Kazakhstan 
were seized, according to a letter to Mr. Issa from RJI. 
Mr. Issa, who had developed a rapport with the Kazakh president on an earlier visit, nonetheless agreed to 
take up the plight of Mr. Hourani. Though he stepped into the fight, he still maintained a close connection to 
the president, nominating him that summer for the Nobel Prize, a move that drew ridicule from human rights 
activists. [that's right, of Vista, CA] [*] 
Ms. Rahall worked on behalf of Mr. Aliyev and later for Mr. Hourani through 2010, contacting the offices of 
at least two dozen members of Congress. They included Representative Howard L. Berman, Democrat of 
California, then chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, whose office said he discussed the dispute 
with the State Department. 
Ms. Rahall also pursued a second strategy. The alternative is to embarrass the existing regime, she wrote in 
a July 2008 e-mail to her boss. 
She pressed House members to criticize the Kazakh government's human rights record. At her request, at 
least five statements were published in the Congressional Record, one citing Mr. Aliyev as a victim of his 
government. Separately, Mr. Aliyev offered to provide the Justice Department with documents that he 
claimed could prove that his former father-in-law accepted bribes from a businessman representing American 
oil companies that were seeking drilling rights in Kazakhstan

limited number of cannabis plants (typically, 4 to 6) for personal use. (Washington is an exception,
however, and makes personal cultivation a felony unless it is done by a person registered in the state’s
medical marijuana database.) Unlike state medical cannabis laws, which may restrict the form of can-
nabis products available, recreational laws permit production and sale of most common forms of can-
nabis products, including a wide variety of flower, concentrates and infused products.

State recreational laws designate state agencies to issue commercial cannabis licenses and regulate
participants in the cannabis supply chain. Some of these agencies are newly established specifically to
regulate cannabis, such as California's Bureau of Cannabis Control (BCC) or Massachusetts’s Cannabis
Control Commission. Others are existing state agencies (and typically oversee tax or alcohol matters),
such as Nevada’s Department of Taxation or Oregon’s Liquor Control Commission. These agencies
also may regulate state medical cannabis industries, as do Colorado’s Marijuana Enforcement Division,
Washington’s Liquor and Cannabis Board and California's BCC.

State regulatory agencies issue separate licenses for different types of commercial cannabis activities.
Common categories of licenses include cultivation, production, manufacturing, distribution, transpor-
tation, laboratory testing and retail. A state may further provide for multiple types of licenses within a
category. For example, California’s recreational law provides for 12 types of cultivation licenses, which
vary according to factors such as the size of a cultivation facility and indoor or outdoor cultivation.
Most states allow companies to hold licenses in multiple categories, thereby allowing vertically inte-
grated cultivation, manufacturing and retail businesses. Washington is an exception—in most cases, a
business is prohibited from holding licenses across categories. Even states that allow vertical integration
typically prohibit the holder of a laboratory testing license from holding licenses in other categories.

State laws give significant power to counties and municipalities to impose zoning and permitting
requirements that may severely restrict or prohibit cannabis activities. California requires a state-license
applicant to demonstrate it has all permits, licenses and approvals required under local law, and many
California cities and counties have effectively banned the recreational cannabis industry. Massachu-
setts allows towns that voted “No” on the state’s recreational law to ban cannabis businesses through
December 2019 and requires other towns that wish to prohibit cannabis businesses to do so through
a local ballot initiative.

Each state has chosen to levy significant taxes on the recreational cannabis industry, and somestate laws
authorize local governments to levy additional cannabis-related taxes. Nevada imposes a 15% excise taxon
cannabis wholesales by cultivators and a 10% excise tax on retail sales. Oregon and Massachusetts charge
a state excise tax of 17% and 10.75%, respectively, and each state authorizes local governments to levy up
to another 3%. Washington originally imposed a 25% excise tax on cannabis sales at each of three different
points in the supply chain— grower to processor, processor to retailer and retailer to consumer—but now
charges a single 37% tax on retail sales. California imposes a 15% excise tax. All state and local cannabis-
specific excise taxes are in addition to normal state and local sales tax. Although the possibility of gen-
erating significant tax revenue is one reason state governments have embraced legal cannabis, some
proponents of legalization argue that high tax rates will keep consumer prices high and discourage
consumer transition to legalized markets.

remains what the court should do with the victim's statement. Currently Rule 11(a)() specifies that the court must consider
the parties views on a nolo plea - but it makes no mention of the victim's views. !4? The CVRA now mandates that victims
must be reasonably heard at any proceeding involving a plea. !>° It is hard to see how anyone could argue that a victim is
reasonably heard when, after making a [*886] statement about the nolo plea, the court is not required to even consider it. The
rule should be amended to require courts to consider victims’ statements.

Rule 11(b)(4) - Victims’ Right To Be Heard on Pleas
The Proposals:

I proposed that the court should be required to address any victim present when a plea is taken to determine whether the victim
wishes to make a statement and to consider the victim's view before accepting a plea, as follows:

Victims’ Views. Before the court accepts a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or allows any plea to be withdrawn, the court must
address any victim who is present personally in open court. During this address, the court must determine whether the victim
wishes to present views regarding the proposed plea or withdrawal and, if so, what those views are. The court shall consider the
victim's views in acting on the proposed plea or withdrawal. !*!

The Advisory Committee recommended no change to Rule 11. 1°?
Discussion:

It is hard to understand why the Advisory Committee declined to recommend changing Rule 11 to require that victims be
addressed, as it did not discuss the idea. '*3 If the Advisory Committee deliberately rejected this idea, it has given no
explanation and it is hard to see any justification for the Advisory Committee's position. The CVRA gives victims the right to
be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving ... [a] plea. '*4 To implement the victim's right to
be heard regarding a plea, my proposed rule change merely required the court to directly address any victim who is present in
court and to consider any views the victim expressed. This is consistent with the CVRA's legislative history which explains that
this provision is intended to allow crime victims to directly address the court in person. !5> The language of the proposed
rule is lifted from an earlier paragraph in Rule 11, which requires the court before accepting a plea of guilty to address the
defendant personally in open court. !*° Victims should be treated evenhandedly with defendants. It may also be important for
the judge to address victims directly because many victims will lack [*887] the assistance of counsel. Untrained in legal
proceedings, victims may be uncertain about exactly when in the process they should present their views. Having the court
address the victim will eliminate that uncertainty and ensure that the victim's right to be heard is vindicated.

The Advisory Committee's global rule on victims’ rights (Rule 60) does briefly address pleas. Tracking language in the
CVRA, the Advisory Committee would require the court to permit a victim to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding ...

49 The rule does mention that the court must consider the public interest in the effective administration of justice in reviewing a nolo plea.
See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11 (a)(3). But this broad phrase does not appear to encompass the views of particular actors regarding a plea, as made

clear by the fact that the rule separately lists the parties' views as something the court must consider.

assassinated and Lee Harvey Oswald was murdered. I had personal connections to each of these
momentous events.

Those years were also eventful in terms of judicial decisions. Many of the most important civil
rights, criminal law and freedom of speech cases were decided during my tenure as a law clerk. It
was a period of liberal judicial activism—the Zenith (or for those more admiring of judicial
restraint, the Nadir) of The Warren Court. It was a heady time for a young liberal lawyer to be in
the nation’s capital.

My year of clerking for Judge Bazelon

Even more important than my substantive experiences in working with these two important
judges, was the personal impact they both had on my life. Each was to serve as a mentor, though
in very different ways, throughout their entire lives. Indeed, I continue to be influenced by them
even years after their deaths.

I arrived in Washington during the summer of 1962, in the midst of the Kennedy Administration.
Although Judge David Bazelon was a court of appeals judge—early in my clerkship he became
Chief Judge—he was at the center of Washington life, both socially and politically. He knew
everyone. He socialized regularly with Senators, Congressmen, cabinet members, White House
staffers, Supreme Court justices, diplomats and other movers and shakers.

He had two clerks, but I was very much his senior clerk, and he didn’t much like or respect his
junior clerk. He saw me as a protégé and he took me with him everywhere that it was appropriate
for me to go. At the center of his social life were the weekly lunches at the office restaurant of a
local liquor distributor named Milton Kronheim, whose personal chef would prepare simple but
superb lunches for “Milton’s boys.” Kronheim himself was in his mid-seventies when I met him.
(He would live to 97, pitching in his weekly company softball game until his late 80s). His
frequent guests, in addition to Judge Bazelon, included Chief Justice Earl Warren, Justices
Thurgood Marshall, William Brennan and William Douglas, Judges J. Skelly Wright, Senators
Abe Ribacoff and Jacob Javits and many other judicial and political notables. The small
lunchroom where Milton’s entertained had photographs of Kronheim with every president since
Harding. Hundreds of other wall-to-wall photographs showed him with just about every
important political, business and sports figure of the Twentieth Century.

Judge Bazelon once told me a joke about Kronheim, which, with a change of name, from
Kronheim to “Katz,” became a standard part of the Jewish joke cannon.

“There was a guy named Kronehiem who bragged he was so famous he could be photographed
with “anyone in the world.” A skeptical friend challenged him. “You can’t be photographed with
the President!” Within days, Kronheim was standing on the White House balcony with JFK, as
photographers snapped pictures.

“Ok,” the friend conceded “maybe in the United States, but not in other parts of the world!” He
then issued another challenge: “You could never be photographed with Israel’s Prime Minister

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018206.txt,"At the other end of the spectrum, using military means in the short term to
guarantee prevention would entail a vast use of force -- essentially an
unofficial, semipermanent occupation of Iran. This is not a viable path,
particularly since other diplomatic possibilities have not yet been
exhausted.

Similarly, sanctions, while effective, are not sufficient by themselves.
They must be intertwined with negotiations -- as Washington and its allies
increase the pressure, cohesive and meaningful talks with equivalent
concessions should follow suit. Some have argued that negotiations should
expand to a big for big format, but decades of mistrust between the
United States and Iran make smaller deals more practical. Such an
approach would have to focus on ending Iran's most problematic
enrichment activity: processing uranium to the 20 percent threshold, which
makes the leap to weapons-grade material much easier. Instead, the regime
could limit itself to 5 percent enrichment, and under strict supervision by
the International Atomic Energy Agency.

The intelligence community widely believes that although Iran has not yet
decided to make a nuclear weapon, it is still moving to acquire all the
necessary capabilities in case it chooses that path. Accordingly,
Washington will need to obtain a concrete Iranian commitment to convert
its stocks of readily upgradeable gaseous uranium into metallic fuel
elements, which pose significantly less of a threat. A serious inspection
system would need to be implemented in order to monitor these
requirements. In return, the Iranians would expect the lifting of nuclear-
related sanctions. They would also likely ask for acknowledgement that
they have the right to continue their civil enrichment program, whether for
supposed use in cancer treatment or to safeguard against a potential
Russian decision to cease fueling the Bushehr reactor.

Thus far, President Obama has been frustrated at the lack of progress in
response to his openness toward the Iranian regime, and his new cabinet
has an obligation to help him solidify a negotiating position that improves
the situation. If the Iranians continue to reject U.S. positions that
seemingly respond to some of their demands, then the administration
should begin applying other pressures. These steps should be taken sooner

Conclusion

In this chapter we have showed that a single approach—game theory, with the help
of evolution and learning—can explain many of our moral intuitions and ideologies.
We now discuss two implications.

Group Selection. Our chapter relates to the debate on group selection, whereby
group level competition and reproduction is supposed to occasionally cause indi-
viduals to evolve to sacrifice their own payoffs to benefit the group (e.g., Wilson,
2006). One of the primary pieces of evidence cited in support of group selection is
the existence of human cooperation and morality (Fehr & Fischbacher, 2003; Fehr,
Fischbacher, & Gichter, 2002; Gintis, Bowles, Boyd, & Fehr, 2003; Haidt, 2012;
Wilson, 2010, 2012), in particular: giving in one-shot anonymous laboratory experi-
ments, intuitively sacrificing one’s life for the group Gumping on the grenade), and
contributions to public goods or charity. However, we have reviewed an alternative
explanation for these phenomena that does not rest on group selection. It also yields
predictions about these phenomena that group selection does not, such as that peo-
ple are more likely to cooperate when they are being observed and there is variance
in the cost of cooperation. The approach described here also explains other phenom-
ena, such as categorical norms and ineffective altruism. These lead to social welfare
losses, which is suboptimal from the group’s perspective. The categorical norm
against murder, for example, leads to enormous waste when keeping alive, some-
times for years, those who have virtually no chance of a future productive life.

Admittedly, despite their inefficiencies, these moral intuitions do not rule out
group selection, since group selection can be weak relative to individual selection.
But it does provide a powerful argument that group selection is unnecessary for
explaining many interesting aspects of human morality. It also suggests that group
selection is, indeed, at most, weak. One example that makes this especially clear is
discrete norms. Recall that we argued that continuous norms are not sustainable
because individuals benefit by deviating around the threshold. Notice that this ben-
efit is small, since the likelihood that signals are right around the threshold is low.
Group selection could easily overwhelm the benefit one would get from deviating
from this Nash equilibrium, suggesting group selection is weak (i.e. there are few
group-level reproductive events, high migration rates, high rates of “mutation” in
the form of experimentation among individuals, etc.).

Logical Justification of Moral Intuitions. In each of the applications above, we
explained moral intuitions without referring to existing a priori logical justifications
by philosophers or others. Our explanation for our sense of rights does not rely on
Locke’s “state of nature.” No argument we gave rests on God as an orderly designer,
on Platonic ideals, on Kant’s concepts of autonomy and humanity, etc. What does
this mean for these a priori justifications? It suggests that they are not the source of
our morality and are, instead, post hoc justifications of our intuitions (Haidt, 2012).

To see what we mean, consider the following analogy. One might wonder why
we find paintings and sculptures of voluptuous women beautiful. Before the

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015524
"
IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027124.txt,"DP: The U.S. has been the patron for democracy for a century, since
Wilson’s 14 Points, and a wonderful heritage it has been. When an
American travels the world, he finds himself in country after country
where his country played a monumentally positive role, especially in
democratizing the system. We naturally want to extend this to Muslim-
majority countries. Sadly, these for some time have offered an unpleasant
choice between brutal and greedy dictators or ideological, extreme, and
antagonistic elected Islamists. It’s not a choice we should accept.

TB: So what should we do?

DP: I offer three simple guidelines. One, always oppose the Islamists. Like
fascists and Communists, they are the totalitarian enemy, whether they
wear long beards in Pakistan or suits in Washington.

Two, always support the liberal, modern, secular people who share our
worldview. They look to us for moral and other sustenance; we should be
true to them. They are not that strong, and cannot take power soon
anywhere, but they represent hope, offering the Muslim world’s only
prospect of escape from the dreary dichotomy of dictatorship or
extremism.

Three, and more difficult, cooperate with dictators but condition it on
pushing them toward reform and opening up. We need the Mubaraks of
the world and they need us. Fine, but relentlessly keep the pressure on
them to improve their rule. Had we begun this process with Abdullah
Saleh of Yemen in 1978 or with Mubarak in 1981, things could have been
very different by 2011. But we didn’t.

TB: Egypt might be the test case.

DP: Well, it’s a bit late. Mohammed Mors! 1s not a greedy dictator but he
emerged from the Muslim Brotherhood, and his efforts since reaching
power have been purely Islamist.

TB: What about the recent elections?

DP: I do not believe that a single one of the elections and referenda in
Egypt was fairly conducted. It surprises me that Western governments and
media are so gullible on this score.

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021276.txt,"From Inclusive Fitness to Spiritual
Striving

The notion of “selfish genes”
(and, by extension, selfish organisms)
was popularized in Richard Dawkins’
1976 book by that title. Not long
afterwards, an article appeared in
Science that presented evidence that the
most vicious members of a warlike tribe
in South America had the most wives
and children. The underlying notion was
one of (genetic) survival of the fittest:
Those warriors who were particularly
vicious were more likely to contribute
their genes to the gene pool.
Methodological objections have left this
an open question, however, and new
evidence now exists that calls this
interpretation into question (1): the most
aggressive warriors may have more
children but they have /ower indices of
reproductive success than their milder
brethren in part perhaps because the
most aggressive warriors and their
offspring are also more likely to be the
targets of revenge killings. These new
data are entirely consistent with John
Cacioppo’s argument that the content of
the human gene pool has more to do
with the reproductive success of one’s
offspring than one’s own reproductive
success. Cacioppo argued further that
this genetic selection resulted in a social
brain that seeks meaning and connection
with individuals and with social entities
(e.g., groups) that extend beyond other
individuals.

In the next chapter, theologian
Don Browning also embraces the
concept of inclusive fitness and, through
the writings of Thomas Aquinas, shows
how religion serves the human need for
meaning and connection through the
ethics they advocate, the congregations
they form, the institutions they represent
and the God they serve. In his view,

?

Page |30

religion serves to extend love and
connection beyond kin. He further
argues that new developments in the
sciences and long-standing traditions in
theology constitute fertile ground on
which to build new and testable
hypotheses regarding our fundamental
human nature.

I packed my bags. I told Danny Yatom to inform the Americans we were
leaving and to get our plane ready to take us back to Israel. I let the others in our
team know that we were going. A number of them, and several of the Americans as
well, urged me to reconsider. But I said I saw no point in staying. What I didn’t
know, however, was that one of the Palestinians’ original Oslo negotiators, Hassan
Asfour, had approached Dennis Ross with a new proposal: that we ask Arafat to
accept everything except the proposal on the holy sites as a basis for negotiation.
Sovereignty over the Temple Mount would be addressed in later, international
negotiations. When Dennis brought this to me, my instinct was to say no. Like so
much else at the summit, it was an inherently skewed formula: it would involve
major Israeli concessions on all the other main issues, without securing our
absolute minimum need in Jerusalem: sovereignty over the Temple Mount. I didn’t
say yes. Still, with Clinton’s words of advice still on my mind, I said that I’d think
it over.

When I met the rest of the Israeli team, almost all of them felt we should stay.
The consensus was that especially if violence broke out after the summit’s
collapse, we didn’t want to feel we’d left any stone unturned. At about 11 pm, I
phoned the President and told him that we would stay until he returned from
Okinawa. He was clearly pleased, and asked us to keep working in his absence.
When I resisted that, saying that any substantive talks needed his involvement, we
finally agreed that talks could continue in search of a formula for the holy sites. On
all the other issues, only informal discussions would be held until and unless a way
ahead on the Temple Mount was found. If that happened, and if Arafat finally
accepted the “pocket” proposals as an agreed starting point, formal negotiations
could resume. Clinton accepted this formula. He went to see Arafat and secured —
or thought he had secured — his agreement as well.

One of the President’s great strengths was his genius for blurring the edges of
potential differences in search of common ground. But when edges had to be
sharpened, this could lead to confusion. Before leaving for the G8, the President
neglected to mention to Arafat our explicit understanding that, with the exception
of the talks on the holy sites, nothing would happen until he accepted the
concessions that President Clinton and I had delivered as at least a basis for further
negotiations. As a result, Arafat’s team now set about happily asking questions and
probing my negotiators — pushing us to go further — but with no more inclination
than before to produce any concessions of their own.

spersed clips from her short film in his keynote address at the Chaos
Computer Club convention of hacktivists in Berlin that month.

Snowden also closely followed her rise in this world. By simply
googling Poitras’s name in January 2013, he would have learned
about her connections with Greenwald, Appelbaum, Binney,
Assange, and other leading figures in the anti-surveillance camp.
When asked later by Poitras why he had chosen her to help him,
Snowden replied, “I didn’t. You chose yourself.” The problem for
Snowden was anonymously drawing her into his enterprise.

Poitras was living in Berlin in January 2013, which made her vul-
nerable to NSA surveillance. To get to her through an encrypted
channel, Snowden chose a circuitous approach. On January 11, he
wrote to Micah Lee in Berkeley, California. Given Lee’s residence
in the United States, as Snowden knew, the NSA would be legally
barred from monitoring his communications without a warrant.
He used Lee, who was the chief technology officer at the Freedom
of the Press Foundation, as the encrypted gateway to Poitras. Lee
was also well-connected to others whom Snowden had contacted

© for his CryptoParty. Lee had been an associate of Runa Sandvik’s at ®
Tor and was a prominent member of Noisebridge, an eclectic anti-
government hackers’ commune based in Northern California, of
which Appelbaum was also a member.

To contact Lee, Snowden chose the alias Anon1o8. Anon is an
alias frequently used by members of the Anonymous commune
of hacktivists. “I’m a friend,” Snowden wrote to Lee. “I need to get
information securely to Laura Poitras and her alone, but I can’t find
an email gpg key for her.” The “gpg” encryption key he asked for,
more commonly called a PGP key, was the so-called public key for
an encryption system called Pretty Good Privacy, or, for short, PGP.
This encryption system required both a public and a private key.
Snowden asked Lee to provide the former one, because Poitras had
the latter one. Lee wrote to Poitras about Anon1o8. The next day,
with the approval of Poitras, Lee supplied Poitras’s public key to
Snowden, or, as he knew him, Anon108.

With it, Snowden contacted Poitras directly. He asked her as a first
step to open an anonymous e-mail account using Tor software. Poi-
tras later wrote about this initial contact, “I was at that point film-

individual seats). 
Guy below is a good friend and he is a CEO of amFAR (amFAR has a joined dinner) — so he helped. 
The nice thing about these tickets is that they are the most VIP. It includes reception, dinner, gala and after all 
party access. 
I have the same ones (through Bill). 
I also got two additional for you but it turns out that they are not the same level so I reached to Kevin for help. 
The price is 2,500Euro per ticket (this is very reduced price as I think the regular one for this is 15K and it is 
hard to get it). They will need an email from someone from your office and name a your guest asap.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013508.txt,"modern dynamical system’s theory describes a convolution of the expansive
motions (as in the upper world) and contractive motions (as in the lower world)
embedded naturally in the curved time and space geometries of what are called
hyperbolic spaces. Each point in this space can be visualized as a little saddle in
which orbital flows from pommel and back flow down to the seat, bringing points
together in contracting motion, and flows away from seat down along the sides are
expanding the distance between nearby points.. In the middle of the saddle,
simultaneously expansive and contracting orbits demonstrate hyperbolic stability
composed of intersecting destabilizing and stabilizing influences. Loss of this
countervailing hyperbolic dynamical stability results in global system
transformations called bifurcations and/or phase transitions.

Transformation as a loss of stability is a theme of a recent poetic translation
of portions of the Zohar called Dreams of Being Eaten Alive by David Rosenberg.
He writes that at some time in the difficult journey through the often-
incomprehensible Zohar, in order to gain entrance to the kabalistic cosmos, there
arose what he called “heartbreak.” “No matter how much intellectual study is
involved, the reader cannot understand the text unless he or she has offered his
heart to be broken on the altar of poetry...and prayer.” Surrender may be the source
of the strange, uplifting feeling of worked through dumbness.

My mother, once a conservatory teaching assistant in piano, sat beside me

seventh chords.” | felt the persistent lack of harmonic resolution as growing tension
in my groin. “If you transform each of the 12 notes in a chromatic scale, multiplying
it by five (in what mathematicians call) mod 712 (the numbering system goes from
one to twelve, not ten, before it repeats), one can recover the circle of fourths, the
commonest harmonic chord progression in music.” Though her computational talk
supported rational thought, in my adolescent heat, the addition of Charley Parker’s
flatted fifth and ninth to the dominant seventh chord led suddenly somewhere else

and she knew it. Hearing my arrangement of a Beethoven piano piece become a

ment. Snowden next introduced Sandvik, who took the podium and
discussed the work of the Tor Project, stressing the importance of
expanding the Tor network. Following their presentations, Snowden
and Sandvik took questions from the audience.

The Oahu CryptoParty, according to Sandvik, ended about
to:00 p.m. No one objected to Mills’s making a video of the meet-
ing, even though it was dedicated to the idea of protecting personal
privacy. The video was not posted on the Internet, so presumably
Snowden wanted it for his own purposes. Afterward, Sandvik went
to a local diner called Zippy’s for a late dinner. She left Hawaii two
days later.

Not all the hacktivists that Snowden invited were able to attend.
Parker Higgins, for example, a prime mover in the Electronic Fron-
tier Foundation and founder of the San Francisco CryptoParty, wrote
back to him that he was unable to attend the December CryptoParty
because of the high price of the airfare that month between San Fran-
cisco and Honolulu. He added that he would try to attend Snowden’s
next CryptoParty, which was scheduled for February 23, 2013. (Hig-

® gins would make headlines in 2013 by flying a chartered blimp over ®
the NSA’s secret facility in Utah and photographing it from the air.)

Snowden’s double duty continued: downloading secret docu-
ments while remaining in touch with some of the leading figures
in the Tor Project under his various aliases. He also continued to
invite activists to his CryptoParties, and he openly advertised them
on the Internet until 2013. The CIA’s former deputy director Morell,
who reviewed the security situation at the NSA in 2014 as a mem-
ber of President Obama’s NSA Review Committee, found that the
NSA in the post-Cold War age had encouraged its technical workers
to freely discuss challenges that arose in its computer operations.
“The idea was to spread knowledge and learn from the successes
of others,” Morell wrote, “but it created enormous security vulner-
ability, given the always-existent risk of an insider committed to
stealing secrets.” According to a former intelligence executive, this
new “open culture,” exemplified by largely unrestricted entry to the
NSANet by civilian contractors, fit the culture of the young civilians
on the “geek squads” who now ran the NSA’s computer networks.

It was remarkable that even in such an “open culture,” Snowden’s

Let us say the Mars particle chooses its answer because of an
external influence. Its Hubble twin must choose the same answer. There
is no problem with this because the Hubble particle could have made its
decision before the Mars particle, so the decision was not predetermined.

But in another frame of reference the choice is made in the opposite
sequence. The Hubble particle chooses after the Mars particle. This is
predetermination and it breaks the Kochen-Specker theorem.

You can reverse the whole analysis and see the same problem from
the other point of view. There is a paradox here however you look at it.

The only solution to the paradox is that both particles make their
choice without any information from an outside source; particles have
free will. This means at least one new piece of information spontaneously
appears in the Universe — a ‘bit’ of free will, so to speak.

You might think there is a problem because the first particle affects
its twin, even if the second did not receive any outside influence. This
would result in the Kochen-Specker paradox reemerging. There is a
neat way out of this; time has no meaning for the particles. Or, I should
say, relative time has no meaning and, therefore, has no effect. There is
no concept of before or after between the particles. They live in a little
bubble of space-time where the order of events has no meaning. The
particles make their free choice together within this safe bubble, and the
paradox is avoided. When we come to measure them, we see they both
made a random decision together, but if we ask which made it first, the
question has no meaning. There is no clock valid for both particles, so
there is no possible answer to the question.

Conway and Kochen have proven sub-atomic particles have free will
— or at least entangled bosons do. At this point, their argument becomes
a philosophical one. They propose that these particles pass on this free
will to larger entities in the Universe and ultimately to us. Although
particles are small and insignificant, they are the fundamental building
blocks of nature, and the butterfly effect multiplies up tiny variations in
the microscopic world into the macroscopic events we see.

Although their theorem is very elegant, we still have to address the
question of whether the experimenter has the true freedom to run the
experiment in the first place: the determined determinist argument.

my head as a 55 year old memory association from a high school English class in which we had to
memorize the author's various works that we read but probably didn't understand. (To show how
little has changed in more than half a century of poor education, my daughter in her sophomore
year at Yale had to memorize and spout back on the final exam, the name of British landscape
portraits, the year they were painted and the museum in which they hang. It's as if God hadn't
invented Google precisely to eliminate such absurd memorization tasks.)

A few years earlier, I impressed my children at Steve’s ice cream shop in Cambridge, which
offered free ice cream to anyone who could answer really obscure trivial pursuit questions. The
question of the month that no one had answered was: “What was the Lone Ranger’s family name?
(Most people said “Ranger.”) I immediately blurted out “Reed.” I added that Reed was also the
Green Hornet’s family name because according to the “origin story” in a comic book that I had
read half a century earlier, they were cousins.

During my junior year in high school, my memory for obscure facts and the “parlor tricks” I
played with it got me an interview with the producers of a television game show called “The
$64,000 question,” but I failed the personality part of the test and was rejected. That was
fortunate, since the show was rigged. (I still have the letter from “Production Services Company”
at 667 Madison Avenue informing me that the results of my written examination “are gratifying”
and inviting me for the personal interview I failed). But my “mother’s memory” has served me
well as a lawyer, teacher—and joke teller. (The downside of remembering every joke I ever
heard is that I rarely get to hear a “new” joke, because I’ve heard—and told—a good many jokes
over my lifetime).

I not only remember the jokes I’ve heard (and told and retold) over the years, but more
importantly, I remember nearly every case I ever read, nearly every fact in the records of cases
and nearly every principle of law I ever learned. I try to teach my students to develop and rely on
their memories rather than on their stereotypical skills. During the first two weeks of law school,
I forbid my first year students to take any notes (“meturnished”). I assure them that nothing
discussed during this “listening” period will be on the exam and I urge them to learn how to listen
and remember, because this will be very important in court and other professional settings. Many
of the students react nervously because they have never been denied the ability to take notes, but
after a few days they acclimate, and some even appreciate, the different regime.

My good memory went mostly to waste in my early years, because there was so little worth
remembering. We would be given a quarter to memorize passages from holy texts and a dollar if
we could recite “by heart” (what does that mean?) an entire chapter from the Bible. Only once
did my memory serve me well during my adolescence, and that was at my Bar Mitzvah. Prior to
“becoming a man,” I had never really excelled at anything. I was good, but not great, at athletics;
good, but not great, with my social life, and God-awful in academics and behavior. But my Bar
Mitzvah performance was perfect. I had read the Torah portion—“Judges and
Magistrates”—flawlessly, because I was able to memorize the entire reading, melody and all. My
performance was the talk of the neighborhood. But a month later, my friend Jerry (now a
prominent rabbi) read his Torah portion in the same synagogue. He was awful, making mistake
after mistake, and singing off tune. It was embarrassing. The rabbi then got up to give the
sermon. He recognized that Jerry had not done well and in order to console him, he referred to

would work for it, including in its secret services. “People less and less see
it as a nationalist endeavor and more as a Khamenei-related project to
strengthen himself,” Javedanfar says, referring to Iran’s Supreme Leader
Ayatullah Ali Khamenei, who by some published accounts personally
authorizes all overseas attacks.

Hard-liners further aggravated the situation by purging competent
reformists from both the secret services and from Iran’s embassies —
crucial to a force expected to work undetected abroad. “Basically the Quds
Force doesn’t cooperate with the Foreign Ministry, and the Foreign

municipal functions and daily life would be divided between Israel and the
Palestinians under a peace agreement.

When I convened our negotiators in my cabin to take stock of the logjam, I was
getting more and more skeptical of finding a way to get to actual negotiation on the
“hard decisions” I assumed both sides knew we’d have to make. I told our team we
could not play that game. Until there was at least some movement from Arafat, I
didn’t want them suggesting any Israeli concessions. We’d obviously get nothing
in return. The summit would fail. Despite my repeated insistence both to the
Americans and Palestinians that, without an agreement, any Israeli suggestions
would be null and void, that didn’t mean they would simply be forgotten. The
result is that we’d actually be in a worse situation than before Camp David.
Politically, I’d find myself in much the same position as President Assad, after the
leak of the American draft from Shepherdstown: apparently ready to consider
giving Arafat the great majority of the West Bank, without the slightest sign Arafat
was ready for a full and final peace. But that wasn’t my main concern. It was that
anything that we put on the table here would handcuff future Israeli governments if
and when an “end of conflict” agreement became possible.

Still, when Dennis Ross learned from my negotiators what I’d decided, he was
frustrated and upset. He came to see me on Saturday morning — day-five of what
was looking increasingly like a stillborn summit. “This summit was your idea,” he
said, reminding me that the President had agreed to it over the reservations of a lot
his own aides. He told me that at a minimum, I| had to help give it a chance: by
giving him my true negotiating “red lines.” Either that, or give my negotiators
more leeway to explore compromises. I did not want to make Dennis’s job any
more difficult than it already was. And I told him I was still ready to engage fully
if we ever got to the real substance of a possible deal. “But I can’t do what you’ve
asked me,” I replied. “Not when Arafat is simply holding firm and not showing a
willingness even to ook for compromises.”

Fortunately for my relationship with the President — though not for the
prospects of an agreement — Clinton had considerably more sympathy with my
position after his next meeting with both sets of negotiators that afternoon. It was a
return encounter with Abu Ala’a on territory and borders. Shlomo Ben-Ami now
produced a map of the West Bank with our proposed breakdown into the areas that
would be controlled by a Palestinian state, the part Israel would retain to
accommodate the major settlements, and territory which we suggested would go to

Search for next FBI director moves ahead quickly 
Attorney General Jeff Sessions interviewed eight candidates to replace fired FBI Director James 
Comey on Saturday, with President Donald Trump indicating that the nomination could be announced 
by Friday when he leaves for his first foreign trip. Potential replacements include FBI special agent 
Adam Lee, Judge Michael Garcia and former Justice Department employee Alice Fisher, who would 
be the first female director. 
New York Post (5/13), Politico (5/14) 
THE BUSINESS & POLITICS POLL 
What's your take on the Comey firing 
President Donald Trump's sudden firing of FBI Director James Comey has stirred a flurry of calls for 
an independent investigation of the event and the FBI's probe into possible collusion between Trump's 
campaign and Russian officials. Critics say the president's action was a deliberate attempt to derail in 
FBI investigation, while defenders say the president acted properly and Comey deserved to be 
fired.This week's question: What's your take on the Comey firing? Cast your vote below. We'll 
post the results Friday. 
The president acted properly and within his powers 
The firing was legal but badly handled 
The firing could be seen as obstructing justice 
The firing was definitely an obstruction of justice

Violation of Chapter 42, Section 42-86 (19) of the Town of Palm Beach Code of
Ordinances, cleared land must be re-sodded or replanted to prevent the creation of
windblown dust or dirt and Chapter 42, Section 42-86, unsightly, unsafe or
unsanitary conditions not permitted and properties to be maintained in good
condition.

Code Enforcement Officer Weymer presented the facts of the case and said the
violation was discovered on routine patrol. Mr. Weymer has been in contact with
a property representative, Louis Pascerelli who said Mr. Horton had not been in
Town to receive his mail. Mr. Weymer said Mr. Pascerelli had proposals from
Hansen Landscape for the clean up and re-sod of the lot and a weekly maintenance
contract to assure this does not happen again. Tropical Irrigation has also been
contacted to put in a new irrigation system. The Town recommends a finding of
non-compliance, administrative costs in the amount of $150.00 and the property
owner be given until August 18, 2008 to come into compliance. Mr. Fried said he
believed a fine of some sort should be imposed. Mr. Ballentine asked how long
Mr. Horton had been out of compliance. Mr. Weymer said the original warning
was sent on June 5, 2008 and a notice of violation and hearing was sent on June
20, 2008. Mr. Weymer said the first contact with the property owner was July 7,
2008. Mr. Ballentine asked if the August compliance date was reasonable and Mr.
Weymer said Jim Hansen of Hansen Landscape thought the work would be done
before that date but wanted more time in case he ran into any problems.

COMPLIANCE, ASSESS ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN THE AMOUNT
OF $150.00 AND GIVE HIM UNTIL AUGUST 18, 2008 TO COME INTO
COMPLIANCE.

Violation of Chapter 42, Section 42-230 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of
Ordinances, leaf blower over 65dBA at 50 ft.

Code Enforcement Officer Weymer presented the facts of the case and said he
witnessed the violation on June 26, 2008. AMF had previously been warned on
February 19, 2008 for using a leaf blower over 65S5dBA. Mr. Weymer performed a
decibel test for this violation and the reading was 79.6 dBA at 50 feet. This is a
class II violation under the fine schedule which has a $125.00 fine for the first
offense. The violation was issued on site to a superintendant for AMF and has not
been paid. The Town recommends a finding of non-compliance, administrative
costs in the amount of $150.00 and payment of the $125.00 fine.

Mr. Hoffman asked whether this company had participated in the leaf blower

testing being offered by Code Enforcement. Mr. Weymer said AMF had
participated in the testing program and had several leaf blowers certified. He said

Billionaire Thomas J. Barrack Jr. has done what few others in Trump's orbit have 
done: He told the president, in effect, that he was wrong. In my opinion, he's better 
than this, Barrack said. 
Trump's relationship with Barrack is one of the most important, if little understood, of 
the president's life, offering a case study of what it takes to remain close to him in a 
time of such turmoil.

Cannabis Investment Report | December 2017

The California State Treasurer’s Cannabis Banking Working Group—a panel convened by Califor-
nia State Treasurer John Chiang that includes representatives from the cannabis industry and financial
institutions, and government tax collection, law enforcement and regulatory agencies—issued a report
in November 2017 on the cannabis industry’s banking challenges. In the report, the State Treasurer's
Office stated that the cannabis industry’s lack of access to banking services is one of the biggest threats
to the success of the state’s recreational cannabis law, which is scheduled for implementation starting
in January 2018. Based on the working group’s findings, the State Treasurer’s Office recommended the
following four actions:

1. Implementation of safer, more effective, and scalable ways to handle the payment of taxes and
fees in cash that minimize risks to stakeholders.

2. Development by the State of California and local governments of a data portal of compliance
and regulatory data to be made available to financial institutions that bank cannabis businesses.

3. Conduct a feasibility study of a public bank or other state-backed financial institution that
provides banking services to the cannabis industry.

4. Establish a multistate consortium of state government representatives and other stakeholders
to pursue changes to federal law in order to remove the barriers to cannabis banking.

The State Treasurer’s Office also stated it was apparent that a definitive solution to the cannabis
banking quandary will remain elusive until the federal government removes cannabis from its official
list of dangerous drugs or the U.S. Congress approves safe harbor legislation protecting financial insti-
tutions that serve cannabis businesses from federal penalties.

Federal Securities Law

The U.S. securities markets and industry participants are regulated principally under two federal laws:
the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).
The Securities Act regulates the offer and sale of securities by issuers, and the Exchange Act regulates
securities firms, stock exchanges, reporting by publicly traded companies and investing and trading
practices of investors. The Exchange Act also establishes the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC), a federal agency charged with enforcing federal securities laws.

Federal securities laws are intended to facilitate capital formation, maintain fair and efficient mar-
kets, and protect investors. The laws are based on a philosophy of disclosure: issuers of securities
generally are obligated to completely and truthfully disclose material information to investors and
the market, and failure to satisfy that obligation may result in civil or criminal penalties. Information
generally required to be disclosed includes audited financial statements, discussions of risks applicable
to the issuer and investors in its securities, and details of conflicts of interest faced by the issuer’s officers
and directors.

Federal securities laws related to private offerings provide fewer investor protections than laws
related to public offerings and generally assume investors in private offerings can “fend for themselves.”
An issuer of securities in a private offering is not subject to the same extensive reporting requirements

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024035.txt,"IV. OPPORTUNITY IN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR

The Fund Managers believe a number of macro market factors have aligned to create attractive
and lasting conditions for NLV-III’s targeted investment strategy in healthcare technology.
Each of these market factors individually would have a direct positive impact on the level of
risk and the potential for returns from investments in the healthcare technology sector. The fact
that there are positive trends in all of them occurring simultaneously is unprecedented, and the
Fund Managers expect that this will create a uniquely positive environment for NLV-III’s
investments in the healthcare technology sector. These macro market factors include the
following:

STRONG GROWTH IN GLOBAL HEALTHCARE MARKETS

Healthcare is one of the largest and most dynamic segments of the global economy, and its
growth is projected to continue the well-established historical trend of outpacing GDP growth
in major economies for at least the next decade.2! In the U.S., since 1970, health care spending
per capita has grown at an average annual rate of 8.2% or 2.4 percentage points faster than
nominal GDP. The persistence of this trend suggests systematic differences between health care
and other economic sectors where growth rates are typically more in line with the overall
economy. A smaller difference is projected over the 2011 to 2020 period, where the average
annual growth in per capita health spending (5.3%) is projected to be about 140 basis points
higher than the growth in GDP (3.9%). This powerful and sustained growth differentiates
healthcare from many other large industrial and technology sectors, and it creates a positive
backdrop for investment in certain areas within the sector.

The drivers of healthcare market growth vary between mature and emerging economies, but in
both cases the shifts are resulting in significant increases in per capita health care consumption
and predictable increases in spending to meet the rising demand. In developed economies,
growth is being driven primarily by an aging population coupled with a continued willingness
of payers to cover the costs for new therapeutics and interventions that meaningfully extend or
improve the quality of patients’ lives. In the U.S., which is representative of the demographic
shifts in other major economies, the number of people over 65 is expected to double over the
next three decades, reaching 70 million by 2030 or roughly 20% of the total U.S. population.
This aging demographic has a higher prevalence of disease and the cost of delivering care to
treat the diseases of this older demographic is rising steadily. For example, in 2009, the per
capita health care cost for a person 65 - 74 years old was approximately $14,000, but it was more
than double that ($33,000) for those over 85. Before the end of this decade, the projected per
capita annual cost to care for these same two groups is expected to rise to $22,000 (+57%) for 65
- 74 year olds and $55,000 (+67%) for those 85+24.

Emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRICs) are also contributing to the
growth in health care spending globally, as these emerging markets mature and begin moving
towards the standards of their counterparts in developed economies. The size of the middle

witnesses, but also the victim as well. ?° Notably, the Advisory Committee's rationale for this change was to implement[] the
victim's right to be treated with fairness’ under the Crime Victims' Rights Act. °?’ But if a change to the relatively obscure
Rule 18 is appropriate in light of the victim's right to fairness, why aren't changes to many other, more significant rules also
appropriate?

Further highlighting the inconsistent treatment of the right to fairness is the way the Advisory Committee handled parallel
provisions in the CVRA. In a single clause, the CVRA gives victims the right to be treated not only with fairness, but also with
dignity and respect: section (a)(8) of the CVRA provides that victims shall enjoy the right to be treated with fairness and with
respect for the victim's dignity and privacy. °* The Advisory Committee used victims' rights to dignity and respect as a
springboard in several places. For example, the Advisory Committee proposed an amendment to prevent inappropriate
subpoenas for personal or confidential formation about a victim, explaining that this amendment implements the Crime
Victims Rights Act, codified at /S U.S.C. § 377](a)(8), which states that victims have a right to respect for their dignity and
privacy. °° Similarly, the Advisory Committee proposed an amendment to prevent the inappropriate release of a victim's
address and telephone number as part of alibi defense disclosures, explaining that this amendment implements the victims’
rights under the Crime Victims Rights Act ... to be treated with respect for the [*878] victim's dignity and privacy. !°° Why
the Advisory Committee believed it appropriate to try to implement the dignity and privacy provisions of the CVRA but not
the immediately adjacent fairness provision is unclear.

C. The Advisory Committee Should Not Leave the CVRA's Interpretation to the Litigation Process.

The Advisory Committee also justified its decision not to review the Rules for fairness on the ground that it would not
attempt to use the rules to anticipate and resolve the interpretative questions that will arise under the CVRA. !°! Yet a basic
purpose - perhaps the basic purpose - behind the procedural rules is to lay out answers to questions that might otherwise have to
be litigated. To that end, Rule 2 of the criminal rules provides that these rules are to be interpreted to provide for the just
determination of every criminal proceeding, to secure simplicity in procedure and fairness in administration, and to eliminate
unjustifiable expense and delay. !° It is at odds with securing simplicity in procedure to simply regurgitate the language of
the CVRA in the criminal rules, leaving every interpretative question to the vagaries of litigation.

Historical examples are legion of the Advisory Committee amending the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure precisely to
resolve questions that were being (or might have been) litigated. To provide a few straightforward examples, in 1979 the
Advisory Committee amended and clarified the standards for presentence withdrawal of a guilty plea. The Advisory Committee
noted that courts had critically stated that the Rule offers little guidance as to the applicable standard for a presentence
withdrawal of plea and that as a result the contours of [the presentence] standard [in the rule] are not easily defined. 1°? The

amendment clarified language which has been a cause of unnecessary confusion. 04

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030258.txt,"﻿The Special Counsel's office, nearly leak-proof since its inception more than a year ago, can appear to be operating in some parallel universe unmoved by the every-day political turmoil. But in the course of conversations I've had researching a new book on President Trump and the forces arrayed against him, it has become clear that Robert Mueller and his office are already preparing for a life or death confrontation with the President and the mother of all constitutional crises.
	Over the last several months the Mueller office has prepared a possible indictment of the president on charges related to obstruction of justice and devised a legal strategy to navigate the inevitable fallout from such an indictment.
	My discussions have been with both White House advisors and people close to the investigation—that is, sources on both sides of the possible conflict. No source involved in this story would speak on the record. But in broad-strokes each side's understanding matches the account provided to me by the other side.
	Since at least April the Special Counsel has had in place a set of allegations, proposed charges, and an aggressive legal theory to support the indictment of the president on obstruction charges. In the last few weeks, as the President has indulged his pardon authority, the Mueller team has also developed a legal basis to oppose what the Special Counsel believes will be a likely pardon of former National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn—who had previously struck a plea bargain which could include his testimony against the President—and what it believes to be another step in the President's obstruction efforts.
	At this point, the case for indictment has, in effect, a judge of one, since the Mueller team must get the approval of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to proceed. As recently as April, Rosenstein publicly declared that the President was not a target, but this may have been a kind of fig leaf: technically the President does not become a formal target until Rosenstein agrees to designate him as one. It may also illustrate a conflict between the Deputy Attorney General and the investigators he has overseen since the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions from the Russia-related investigation—though, according to one source, Mueller believes he does have the support of his boss.
	The proposed indictment would be all the more controversial because it finds the entire narrative of the case for obstruction in plain sight. Almost nothing in it involves new information; rather, it takes well-covered public events and moves them to a set of circumstantial conclusions. There is no smoking gun beyond the often flagrant, custom-breaking, events of the President's 16 months in office. Indeed, much of the evidence is based on the President's public statements and tweets about those events. This indictment could have been drafted without anyone being interviewed, said one source. This is, from the perspective of White House sources good news: the case then, is just an issue of what motives are ascribed to the President's behavior—behavior that is, the President's supporters believe it is easy to show, impulsive and not thought out. Hence no intent. For the Mueller team, it is precisely that careless behavior and flagrant disregard for constitutional standards that they hope to put on trial.
	According to a source involved in the Mueller strategy, the plan to indict the President is now more advanced than it was when the terms of the indictment were agreed in April. In the intervening months, the president’s lawyers, spokespersons and surrogates have staged a very public debate about whether such a legal proceeding would be constitutional—in effect trying to discredit, ahead of time, any prosecutorial action the Special Counsel’s office might take. This may be a preemptive response to an indictment they expect is forthcoming. It may also be an effort to pressure Rosenstein. It may even be an effort to convince Mueller of that, since some in the White House believe that that the plan to indict is not a strategy yet embraced by the whole Special Counsel’s office, but one that is being advocated only by its most virulently anti-Trump purists on the investigative team—most notably by the number two lawyer under Mueller, Andrew Weissmann.
	It may be noteworthy that there appears now not to be plan for an indictment related to collusion, although, legal experts say, that could come later and may depend on new information from the investigation of the President's personal attorney, Michael Cohen. It is also possible that alternative plans have been made—preparation for more expansive indictments, for instance, or for a broader report that would include the allegations of obstruction but not seek to indict the President. 
	The White House view is that without the underlying collusion charge—real collusion, in the words of one White House advisor, and not just a bunch of Facebook ads and some trolls—Mueller will be presenting a weak and politically-motivated case. That's a witch hunt, said the advisor. The view of the Mueller team, or at least that of its most ardent members, seems to be that the obstruction charges go to the very heart of exposing how Trump has abused his power and turned the White House into a corrupt fiefdom.
	According to one source, Mueller could hardly contain his disgust when last month Rudy Giuliani, the President's new lawyer—hired to make a case for the President on television and to push back against the Mueller team—airily dismissed the notion that a sitting president can be indicted. Adding insult to injury, Giuliani—who a White House source said has likely learned of aspects of the pending indictment—said Mueller agreed with that assessment. White House sources believe Giuliani was daring the Special Counsel to tip his hand. But Mueller, ever in character, contained his outrage and continued to hold his cards close, as his team finished preparing the obstruction case and refined the legal theories under which it would claim the right to haul the president into court.
	According to the proposed indictment, the President's scheme to obstruct the FBI's investigation into connections between the Trump campaign and Russian efforts to undermine the U.S. election began on the 7th day of the Trump administration. Three days prior, on January 24, National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, lied to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian Ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. These were contacts, according to the indictment, directed by an unnamed but ranking member of the Presidential Transition team. In the view of several former DOJ lawyers who discussed the case with me, that unnamed person could be Trump himself. From January 27th, when the President had the one-on-one dinner with FBI Director James Comey, through to the middle of April, the President conducted a cat and mouse game with Comey, testing his loyalty and trying to establish his willingness to aide the President and protect Flynn.  On May 9th, baldly admitting his dissatisfaction with Comey's unwillingness to play ball on Russia, the President fired the FBI director. Shortly thereafter, continuing his efforts to disrupt the investigation, the President turned his ire on the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, pressuring him to fall into line on the President's behalf, and on Robert Mueller, the newly appointed Special Counsel, pushing to fire him to block the investigation. 
	The second episode addressed in the indictment took place on July 8, on Air Force one, where the President personally directed his son, Don, Jr., to lie about the reason for his meeting in Trump Tower, during the campaign, with representatives of the Russian government—a meeting about collaborating with the Russians to undermine Hillary Clinton's campaign. 
	The third episode detailed in the indictment began on June 7th, after reports that Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe would confirm statements made by James Comey about how the president had tried to intimidate him. In response, the President began a campaign of harassment, threats, and intimidation against McCabe. On March 16, 2018, after McCabe testified before Congress, the President, in retaliation, caused his dismissal and the loss of his pension.


	The Mueller team may have a high hurdle in convincing Rosenstein to approve the indictment. In its preparation for a possible indictment, the Mueller team argues that nothing in the Constitution or in a statute suggests a status with regard to criminal prosecution for the President different from any other federal office. Nor is there any statute or case law that finds that impeachment has to come before an indictment. But the Department of Justice's standing view precludes charging a sitting president with a crime. This is based on an opinion written by the Office of Legal Counsel in the Watergate era and recently expressed in hyperbolic terms by Giuliani: the President could kill James Comey if he wanted to without fear of prosecution. But, according to several former DOJ lawyers, Rosenstein in this circumstance may have the power to override the Office of Legal Counsel opinion. The Mueller team appears to believe that Rosenstein's pledge before congress that, absent malfeasance, he will support the Special Counsel's independence with regard to the Russian investigation, means he will let the indictment go forward. In one view—and in the suspicion of some in the White House—he may have already authorized Mueller to proceed with the indictment.
	The White House has made the argument—supported in many television appearances by Trump legal surrogate, Alan Dershowitz— that a president cannot be prosecuted for exercising his constitutional prerogatives, even if those actions foster a crime, that the President, as the ultimate federal office, and the nation's chief law enforcement officer, enjoys nearly unfettered latitude in how he carries out his duties. I don't think you are going to find a court who will not see the president's role as unique, said one White House advisor. The Mueller theories are wishful thinking.
	An indictment for obstruction of Justice is described in similar ways by both Mueller and White House insiders: it puts the President's public behavior on trial. The nature of that behavior, for the Mueller team, is corrupt; this, according to the White House, is how voters elected the President to behave.
	The Special Counsel seems less worried about its legal position than it does about it's existential one—continuing to anticipate how the President might use his authority to move against it. 
	It sees its most immediate threat as a move by the President to replace Rosenstein. Here it believes that in the inevitable Supreme Court battle that would follow a direct attempt by the President to fire the Special Counsel, the Court would likely rebuff such an expansion of Presidential authority. At the same time, according to its internal research, the Mueller team understands that the President, acting with only somewhat more subtlety, would have the authority to order the Attorney General—even given his prior recusal—to repeal the Special Counsel regulations and close down the investigation. He can fire the Attorney General if he refuses. The President, could, too, according to the Special Counsel's analysis, fire Rosenstein and seek someone else to oversee the investigation in ways more to his liking. Both of these actions could, the Special Counsel believes, become part of the behavior that it argues in the indictment amounts to a prima facie case for obstruction of justice. 
	The Mueller team continues to believe it is protected by political realities—the President can not know how Congress might respond, and it might well respond with impeachment—and by bureaucratic ones. Changes to the Special Counsel authorization might require an extended comment period, meanwhile leaving the Special Counsel's status unchanged.
	Still, what if the President, acting unilaterally, does shut it down? This, people around the President say is the unknown legal area that might be advantageous to the President. The delays and disruption that result as courts sort out the ramifications of the President's actions might well be the President's legal friend—the reason some in the White House have been urging the President to end the investigation, whatever the political fallout. 
	If so, what then happens to all the work the Special Counsel's office has done, and, indeed, to the sitting Grand Juries reviewing the evidence? The special counsel's view, according to insiders working on the issues, is that nobody knows. The optimistic legal view is that the Office and staff would survive the Special Counsel's ouster and their work preserved. And that actions taken by the Grand Jury would remain in effect.
	This, however, would probably not be true if the Attorney General refused the next Special Counsel's budget request—due on July 1. That would shut down the whole operation—the Special Counsel staff and grand juries. There might, however, according to research the team has prepared, be enough time between the order and the shuttering for the Special Counsel to share the grand jury evidence with other federal prosecutors, who might act on their own authority to pursue the President.
	The President's constitutional pardon powers appear to be some of the most troubling and threatening issues for the Special Counsel. The Counsel's office believes the President will use his pardon power as an instrument to undermine the investigation.
	According to present and former White House advisors, the President's recent spate of pardons are in part his way of taunting the Special Counsel. The White House, according to these sources, is aware that the Special Counsel has concluded the President's pardon power is near absolute: the President can certainly pardon himself, and others involved in the investigation. 
	Early in June, the Special Counsel, believing that a pardon for Michael Flynn was imminent, rushed to build a case that might form an exception to the President's pardon authority. The argument, perhaps a slim-thread one, tries to undermine what both the White House and many outside legal authorities, and much of the Special Counsel's own research, believes to be one of the few unchallengeable powers granted the President. In effect, the Special Counsel continues the theme of it's case: there is a level of obstruction of justice that all reasonable men might know when they see it. If you pardon someone to get yourself off the hook, that's a corrupt action. The constitution is not a statute that you might violate, but a larger covenant which you might offend (or, equally, that might protect you). Since the President is in charge of upholding the constitution and much of the constitution is about preventing corrupt acts or abuses of power, the pardon, in the case of Michael Flynn, is, the Mueller team is set to argue, unconstitutional. What's more, since there is an impeachment process in place—or there are impeachment resolutions before congress—and impeachment is the province of Congress, a pardon of a potential witness in this impeachment is an unconstitutional trampling on the separation of powers.

As the President, by nature and design, tries to claim aggressive new powers, the Mueller team, almost in equal proportion, is trying to limit the theory of Presidential power and, even, to criminalize an expansive exercise of those powers. 
	People who know and have worked with Mueller find it, at best, unexpected that this traditional by the book G-man would be pursuing such far-reaching legal theories. But one possible explanation, shared by many in the White House, is that Mueller is overly reliant on his staff—in face, is being led by his number two, Andrew Weissmann.
     Weismann has a longstanding reputation for aggression: he was the prosecutor whose pursuit of the accounting firm Arthur Anderson in the Enron debacle ended in its conviction—a judgment reversed well after the firm's bankruptcy and dissolution. One White House advisor likened him to Victor Hugo's obsessed policeman Inspector Javert—a prosecutor consumed with taking down the President. Indeed, Weissmann, who has in the past contributed to Democratic candidates, is a particular bet noir and favorite whipping boy for the White House his central role in the Mueller investigation taken there as evidence of a deep bias against Donald Trump. 
	But in another view it is precisely because Mueller, a former Marine, is so by the book and Semper Fi that he finds Trump's behavior to be personally offensive, and, on its face, corrupt. Bob Mueller is all about limits and rules. Donald Trump has none and acknowledges none, said one lawyer who has worked with Mueller in the past.
	It may yet be even a more profound clash then that, the executive branch at war with itself—the Justice Department against the White House. In this, the President's almost daily tirades against the DOJ, the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, the Deputy Attorney General, Rosenstein, the former head of the FBI, Comey, and his deputy, Andrew McCabe, are part of an effort to obstruct justice and save himself.
	The Mueller strategy (or Weissmann strategy) is a war strategy, in the view of some legal observers. An indictment of the President would be litigated to the hilt. It would force both the substantive issues of obstruction and abuse of power and the meta issues of Presidential immunity—in essence, the President's claims to being above the law—into open court for a long and painful review and dissection that might shadow the November election. 
	Legal experts believe that the Mueller team might well prevail in lower courts with a much less certain outcome in the Supreme Court. 
	Were the case to reach the Supreme Court after the November election, it might well be the results of that election that help seal the President's fate not just in Congress but also in the courts.
	Might such an expansive claim win, yes. Should it win, no. But everyone knows the reality: weak presidents lose cases, strong presidents win them, said Ken Starr, the former independent prosecutor who might know more about the legal pursuit of the president than anyone else on earth.

South China Sea: making sense of

nonsense
Mark Valencia

June 29 — After a series of aggressive incidents involving Chinese
patrol boats and subsequent soothing official statements, many
analysts are trying to figure out what is really going on.

More specifically, why have different sections of China's government
given mixed signals and chosen in nearly one fell swoop to embarrass
their own leaders, undermine China's carefully nurtured and
reasonably successful charm offensive toward the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and play right into the U.S.
strategy of convincing ASEAN nations that they need its protection
from a bullying China?

In China, has the political train left the station and are ASEAN
nations thus just changing seats or cars on the train?

We are talking here not just about blatant violations of the solemnly
agreed Declaration on Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea
(DOC) — all parties are guilty of that — but also of contradicting, by
poorly timed actions, the words of leaders. When Chinese Defense
Minister General Liang Guanglie was telling the Shangri-la Dialogue
on June 3 in Singapore that China is committed to maintaining
peace and stability in the South China Sea and that China stood by
the DOC, news media were reporting that on May 26 a Vietnamese
survey ship operating on its claimed continental shelf had its seismic
cables cut by a Chinese patrol boat.

Shortly after that event China sent two vice chairmen of the Central
Military Commission to Southeast Asia to try to reassure other

I was confident of finally answering that question at the summit. Camp David
was different from Shepherdstown. No reporters would be there. Mobile phones
were banned. Each delegation had one landline. We’d also be operating under a
time constraint. President Clinton was due to leave for a G8 summit in Japan on
July 19. The gave us barely a week. I did wonder whether that would be enough,
even if both sides were committed to reaching a peace agreement. Yet I hoped it
would at least provide the possibility, as it had for Begin and Sadat twenty-two
years earlier, to reach a framework agreement that open the door to a final peace
treaty.

Not just the time, but the numbers were limited. We and the Palestinians could
have only a dozen members in our negotiating teams. Some of my choices were
automatic: Danny Yatom; Shlomo Ben-Ami, whom I’d made acting Foreign
Minister in Levy’s absence; Amnon Lipkin and Attorney-General Elyakim
Rubinstein; Gilead Sher and his chief negotiating aide, Gidi Grinstein. I also took
along a strong security team, including Shlomo Yanai, head of strategic planning
the kirya, and Israel Hason, a former deputy-head of Shin Bet. There was another
important, if less obvious, inclusion: Dan Meridor. A leading member of the Likud
before he’d formed the Center Party at the last election, Dan was not just a friend.
He was a man of rock-solid integrity, with a strong moral and ethical compass,
who put principle over party. He was also a lawyer, and had been Minister of
Justice under Bibi. Along with Attorney-General Rubinstein, I knew I’d have a
gifted legal team if we got to the point of considering the specifics of a peace
agreement. There was another consideration as well. Both Dan and Elyakim were
right-of-center politically. I felt I needed their voices as a kind of litmus for the
tough decisions, and concessions, I might have to consider if an agreement did
prove possible.

I was not nervous as we crossed the Atlantic, though even those who knew me
best assumed I would be. Nava had sent me off with a list of dietary instructions,
almost like a surgeon general’s warning that Camp David might prove hazardous
to my health. But I felt prepared. I’d gone to every source I could find about the
Begin-Sadat summit. I knew there would be periods of crisis and that at certain
points I’d have to allow leeway for my own team to explore possible compromises
beyond our set negotiating limits. Yet none of this altered my belief that holding
the summit was the right thing to do, nor my confidence in being able to play my
part. I did feel a huge responsibility. Decades after our conflict with the

Eye on the Market, February 27, 2012 [the attached PDF is much easier to read this week, particularly if you are interested in the energy science implications of last week’s press release from the House Minority Leader]

Topics: oil markets and Iran

 

Most of this week’s note deals with oil prices and Iran, but I did want to point out a trend that is illustrative of how things are going globally.  One of the strongest aspects of the US recovery has been the rebound in business spending on equipment and software.  As highlighted by our friends at Hamiltonian Associates, sales by Caterpillar’s dealer network are a proxy for global trends.  Caterpillar’s US sales are leading the pack for the first time in a while, Asia is moderating, and Europe trails with a distinctly negative trend.  We expect a recovery in US payrolls this year, and eventually, in labor incomes.  The US recovery may be weak by historical standards, but expectations are pretty low (2.2% growth in 2012).  We expect the US to exceed expectations, and for Europe ex-Germany to disappoint them.  Absent a blow-up in Iran, this view seems like it’s on track.  

 

“Iranium enrichment”: another hurdle for global markets to surmount

The near-term fundamentals don’t point to higher oil prices.  Oil demand has been revised down a bit, particularly in the OECD, and non-OPEC supply growth is a little higher in 2012 than in recent years.  After netting all the supply and demand factors, it looks like there will be a global oil inventory build in 2012 (see chart below), not something we would normally associate with rising oil prices.  However, even before we get to Iran, there are other factors contributing to higher prices: a pick-up in global growth expectations for 2013 and beyond; the explosion of Central Bank balance sheets and associated reflation goals (see last week’s EoTM); and the possibility that China’s will build strategic crude oil reserves to the IEA standard of 90 days from their current level of 14.  Note as well that the inventory build is a small one, nowhere near 2002-2007 levels.



 

 

That’s why Iran is a risk: a disruption would make oil markets even tighter, and drive gasoline prices up further.  Even before the February spike, gasoline prices relative to earnings and income were starting to bite (2nd chart).   The private sector can handle some gasoline price increases, but probably not much more than what we’ve seen already.  The spread between retail and wholesale gasoline prices is low ($0.35, compared to a $0.35-$1.00 range), suggesting further retail increases may be in store.

 

People like me now spend a lot of time on conference calls with geopolitical experts of different stripes.  On one call, speakers raised the probability of military action from 30% to 50%.  On another call, speakers mentioned that the US has “run out of senior military advisors to send to Israel, all requesting that Israel not attack unilaterally”, and believe Israel won’t.  A paper by Matt Kroenig in Foreign Affairs magazine entitled “Time to Attack Iran; Why a Strike is the Least Bad Option” resulted in a firestorm of criticism from multiple sides.  With sanctions appearing to work (Iran’s inflation, currency collapse, fewer buyers of its oil and a potential ban on Iranian banks from the global SWIFT payments network), won’t the US want to wait and see?  Most of the US military establishment seems to take this view.  The conjecture is endless.  Here are a few points I found to be of greatest relevance as we sift through this:

 

** The US and Europe appear to take the Israeli attack threat seriously.  Economic recoveries are just beginning to form in both regions, and there are elections coming up, so for politicians to ratchet up sanctions and drive up oil and gasoline prices, they must be very concerned that without tougher sanctions, the Israelis might act.

 

** Iran’s Fordow facility is key to understanding the debate about the effectiveness of military action, and why some are nervous that the “window for action is closing”.  Fordow is estimated to be 80-90 meters below grade, and is suspected of being ready for uranium enrichment.  The Iranians reportedly have ~80 kg of 20% enriched uranium (UF6), and need 25 kg more to convert it into enough uranium metal (UF4) for a nuclear bomb.  The most powerful conventional weapon in the US arsenal is the Massive Ordnance Penetration device (MOP), a 30,000 pound bomb with 5,000 pounds of explosives.  It travels at twice the speed of sound, and is designed to penetrate rock and concrete before detonating.  However, it would probably take 4 of these weapons, dropped in succession by B-2 bombers in the same exact spot, to destroy Fordow [a].

 

** Military strikes could quickly escalate to engulf the entire region.  While the Israel-Iran and US-Iran dimensions are important to understand, so too are the Sunni-Shia issues in play.  Any complicity by Sunni countries in conjunction with US action (airspace, attack plans and logistics, etc.) might be seen as acts of war by Iran. 

 

** The Strait of Hormuz carries 20% of the world’s oil (17 million bpd).  There are active and de-activated pipelines in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and the UAE that could divert around 5-6 mm bpd, and strategic petroleum reserves could be released.  Even so, a military battle in the Strait could cause oil prices to rise $20-$30, according to EIA and GAO 2007 estimates.

 

To be fair to all the analysts, journalists and think tanks, there is no reason to expect greater foresight now than during the Cuban Missile Crisis, Iraq War or other military standoffs. This is a binary market risk that in our view justifies material consideration in portfolio allocations, and that’s about all we know.  Our 2012 Outlook section on this issue was entitled “Learning to Live with a Nuclear Iran”, and that may very well be where this ends up.

 

As a reminder, since 2001, rising oil prices have coincided with a gradual exhaustion of conventional oil to meet marginal demand, sharp increases in operating and commodity input costs for oil companies, deeper exploratory and developmental wells, reliance on a shrinking number of deepwater fields, rising E&P spending by US oil majors to meet rising EM demand, etc.   A simplified version of this dynamic appears below: as oil production rises to meet global demand, the sources for the marginal barrel become more expensive and more complicated.  Without getting into the whole Peak Oil thing, I do think there is evidence that the marginal cost of oil will be a speed bump on growth in the years ahead, if oil production has to rise over 90 million barrels per day to support demand and the building of strategic reserves.

 



 

Output from the Congressional Centrifuge

In the midst of all the above, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi issued the following press release: 

 

“Independent reports confirm that speculators are driving up the cost of oil, hurting consumers and potentially damaging the economic recovery. Wall Street profiteering, not oil shortages, is the cause of the price spike.  In fact, U.S. oil production is at its highest level since 2003, and millions of acres have been cleared for additional development.   We need to take strong action to protect consumers from this speculation.  Unfortunately, Republicans have chosen to protect the interests of Wall Street speculators and oil companies instead of the interests of working Americans by obstructing the agencies with the responsibility of enforcing consumer protection laws.  They have also repeatedly opposed our efforts to end billions of dollars in outdated taxpayer subsidies for oil companies enjoying record profits.

 

We support efforts by the Obama Administration to expand domestic energy resources, including natural gas and renewable sources like wind and solar that create jobs in America and will end our dangerous dependence on foreign energy supplies.  This can be achieved because today, the United States currently has more oil and gas rigs at work than the rest of the world combined, and imports of foreign oil have decreased.

 

We call on the Republican leadership to act on behalf of American consumers and join our efforts to crack down on speculators who care more about their profits than the price at the pump even if these spikes harm the American consumer and our economy.”

 

I am of course not going to comment directly on this, for many reasons, including not wanting to spend my days at California’s solar-powered detention facility in Chuckawalla Valley.  However, for anyone interested in the specific points raised in this press release, I have included some charts on the unfortunately binding constraints of science and energy economics.  Enjoy.

 



 



 

5. Now let’s get to the interesting part. The press release implies that natural gas and renewable energy can reduce American dependence on foreign oil (“end” is the word used). This is an appealing proposition, particularly with Brent oil prices now 5 times higher than natural gas prices on a BTU basis. So, let’s assume that the US wanted to cease all oil imports from Venezuela, Russia and the Persian Gulf. This would reduce oil imports by ~30%. If Americans still wanted to drive around just as much, absent an increase of 2.8 million bpd in US domestic crude production, electricity would have to replace the foregone gasoline.  Ergo: how much wind power or natural gas would be needed, assuming electric cars at 200 watt hours per km? And what policies would be needed on fracking, eminent domain, and subsidies for high voltage direct current power lines to transmit electricity at acceptable loss rates?

 

Note: the charts below only account for the foregone gasoline component of the imported crude oil. Gasoline is only around 45%-50% of total refined products. The US would also have to come up with suitable domestic or foreign replacements for the rest of the barrel: jet fuel, heating oil, fuel oil, lube oils, asphalt, etc. This is a topic that is often neglected in discussions about reducing reliance on foreign oil: we do a lot more with it than just drive cars.

[Note a] Austin Long at Columbia University walked me through the geodynamics of the MOP and how many would be needed to penetrate the Fordow facility.  His calculations are a function of soil hardness/density, the weapon’s mass and impact velocity, the shape of its cone, and the percentage of each penetration that collapses back in as “spoil”, blocking the hole created by previous weapons.  The estimate of 4 MOPs is based on the assumption of a modest amount of gravel spoilage, and less dense soil.  Higher soil density and gravel estimates could require 2-4 more bombs.

have brought them to November 2007 and they would have gotten additional time
for Hurricane Wilma which would have brought them to December. If they were
under the new Code, they would not be before the Board today and may not have
a fine at all. He realizes a mistake was made, he realizes something has to be paid
but he thinks $35,000 is a significant fine. The Board has gotten their attention
and they would ask for a significant reduction in the fine.

Mr. Fried asked how long it took to get the final inspection after the 22 months
had run. Mr. Walton said they had been given 23 months due to the hurricanes
and they were 5 months and 9 days beyond that. Mr. Ballentine asked how far out
they would be under the new rules. Mr. Walton said they would be given 24
months which with the hurricane would be 25 months. Mr. Lynch said that at the
end of that 24 month period, if they had not sought an extension of time within the
required time period, no earlier than 6 months and no later than 45 days, before the
expiration of that 24 months, their project would have been shut down. Mr.
Wagner’s lack of knowledge of this particular situation would have become
irrelevant because they would have been red tagged on the next day after the 24
month period. Mr. Lynch said Mr. Wagner did not know because he has been a
good corporate citizen and had never been before the Board except on one
occasion which was beyond his control; it was a maintenance item on the Glazer
house. Mr. Walton said that situation was not due to Mr. Wagner’s fault, that he
was just representing the owner.

Mr. Ballentine asked how Mr. Wagner did not know the Code requirement if he
had built so many homes in the area and said he had difficulty with the ignorance
of that.

Mr. Fried said he agreed with Mr. Ballentine and found it hard to believe that Mr.
Wagner did not know the time limits. He said some reduction should be considered
but he was not sure on what basis.

Mr. Ochstein remarked that the fine was around $35,000 and the house was on the
market for $10.6 million dollars so he did not see the hardship. Mr. Lynch said he
did not know the price but he would accept Mr. Ochstein’s statement on that. Mr.
Lynch said the hardship was in the imposition of the fine itself, there were mistakes
made and he believed that Council would have given them a significant extension
of time if Mr. Wagner had been aware of the situation and filed the proper notice
with Town Council.

Mr. Lynch said if some sort of arrangement could be reached today, his client
would be in a position to pay within the next two weeks. Mr. Hoffman said he
was concerned because he believed that when the case was originally heard, they
had the option of fining $250.00 a day and they gave them a fine reduction at the
time they initiated the fine of $125.00 a day. Mr. Walton corrected Mr. Hoffman,
advising there was a motion for a fine of $125.00 a day which failed and the fine
that was in effect was $250.00 a day. Mr. Lynch said he believed the record
reflects something different than that. Mr. Walton said his records reflect $250.00

SINGAPORE AND ASEAN

Singapore is unique in that it is the only majority ethnic Chinese state outside of
Greater China (Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao). Singapore is also unique in Southeast Asia
because its rigorous standards of governance and zero tolerance for corruption make it
virtually impossible to bribe or openly suborn political leaders or opinion-leaders.

In 2016-17, Singapore’s generally friendly, smooth relationship with China took a
downturn. The proximate cause was Singapore becoming country coordinator for
China for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). This post is held

by ASEAN member states by rotation for a three-year term. China seemed to have
convinced itself that the role entailed Singapore “coordinating” ASEAN’s position on
the South China Sea (SCS) territorial disputes in its favor. But China has long been
unhappy with Singapore’s clear and consistent position on the SCS. Singapore is not a
claimant state to the South China Sea. The previous country coordinator was Vietnam,
a claimant state whose relationship with China has been historically fraught. Chinese
expectations of Singapore may have been unrealistically high, particularly after the
Arbitral Tribunal on the case brought by the Philippines against China ruled against
China’s position in a verdict in July 2016.

China criticized Singapore’s support for SCS disputes being resolved in accordance with
international law as “taking sides.” It objected to Singapore’s leaders and officials even
speaking on the SCS issue. When Singapore stood firm on its right to state its position
on an issue of undoubted importance to the region, the Chinese influence apparatus

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026560.txt,"In a well-publicized national scandal in 2008, the Tehran police commander responsible
for enforcing Iran's strict anti-vice laws, Reza Zarei, was caught nude in a brothel with six
women (one of the women claimed he had asked them to pray naked in front of him).
While American politicians might bounce back from such transgressions with their

own television show (see: Spitzer, Eliot), the revelation of the incident reportedly led

Zarei to attempt suicide while in prison.

The shame of sexual malfeasance has been routinely used by the regime as a form of
political coercion and intimidation. When the famously jocular reformist cleric
Mohammad Ali Abtahi, former vice president to Mohammad Khatami, was imprisoned
after Iran's contested 2009 presidential election, he surprised his supporters by confessing
with great gusto to being part of a Western-backed conspiracy to foment a velvet
revolution. Although his confession was undoubtedly forced, his close associates claim that
what compelled him to confess was not physical or psychological torture but hidden
photos of him -- in flagrante delicto -- at a secret Tehran love nest that was long being

monitored.

The Islamic Republic isn't always so prudish, however. In fact, it's been willing to use
sexual incentives as a form of statecraft. Ina WikiLeaked U.S. State Department
cable, for example, senior Iraqi tribal chief Abu Cheffat confided in a U.S. diplomat in
Baghdad that Tehran effectively wielded influence over Iraqi politicians -- ostensibly
visiting Iran for medical treatment -- by offering inducements including temporary
marriages with Iranian women. Not that Cheffat was complaining, mind you: The perks
were surely better than when he visited President George W. Bush at the White House in
2008. It was not without reason, he explained, that Iranian soft power was trumping

American hard power in Iraq.

More recently, three Iranian intelligence agents who unsuccessfully tried to kill Israeli
government officials in Bangkok this past February photographed themselves at a bar in
the beach resort of Pattaya with local escorts. When I asked the scion of a powerful
cleric in Tehran how ostensible devotees of Khomeini's religious ideology are able to
reconcile frequenting non-Muslim prostitutes and drinking alcohol, he quickly dismissed

any religious obstacles. There are government clerics who can easily grant them religious

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023772.txt,"26 Teaching Minds

I most certainly taught the lessons this writer describes. I hated it
when students couldn’t get to the point and I frequently interrupted
them when they were speaking. In business, I make a point of saying
things that are very simple, which tends to upset people. I find this a
good way to start a conversation that addresses complex issues.

Of course, I never actually say any of this. I simply do it. The real
issue in teaching, by parents or by teachers or by anyone else, is the
model you present to the students. That model is presented by what
they see you do and how they see you act. They can choose to emulate
you or not. But a good teacher makes students think about how to
behave and about what works and what doesn’t.

| believe that effective teaching makes .. .

students think about how the teacher is behaving and causes
the students to wonder about whether copying this behavior
would be a good idea

students think about what works and what doesn’t in the adult
world

This next writer is a professor at a major university. I hired him to be
on the faculty at Yale, which was his first academic job.

I teach by telling stories that are meaningful to me. I let them
see who I am and how I live. I let them see what is important
to me and why. To be a real teacher you have to let yourself be
vulnerable. The student needs to see that you are a human with
feelings and fears and goals. You are saying to students: This is
the way I do it; it fits with who I am; it helps me be successful;
and don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t do something.
Everyone wants to control you, but in the end, you have to be
you, for better or worse. So, don’t let anyone tell you that you
can’t do something.

I tell that story over and over and over again in different
ways. About my research, about my company, about my family. I
walk the talk.

And, the students have to see that there are consequences
of breaking the rules; that it costs; and the costs can be high

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013246.txt,"330 A Glossary

within a deme, programs are generally similar enough that reasonable syntax-semantics
correlation obtains.

e Derived Hypergraph: The SMEPH hypergraph obtained via modeling a system in terms
of a hypergraph representing its internal states and their relationships. For instance, a
SMEPH vertex represents a collection of internal states that habitually occur in relation to
similar external situations. A SMEPH edge represents a relationship between two SMEPH
vertices (e.g. a similarity or inheritance relationship). The terminology edge /vertex” is
used in this context, to distinguish from the “link / node” terminology used in the context
of the Atomspace.

e DeSTIN — Deep SpatioTemporal Inference Network: A specific CSDLN created by
Itamar Arel, tested on visual perception, and appropriate for integration within CogPrime.

e Dialogue: Linguistic interaction between two or more parties. In a CogPrime context, this
may be in English or another natural language, or it may be in Lojban or Psynese.

e Dialogue Control: The process of determining what to say at each juncture in a dialogue.
This is distinguished from the linguistic aspects of dialogue, language comprehension and
language generation. Dialogue control applies to Psynese or Lojban, as well as to human
natural language.

e Dimensional Embedding: The process of embedding entities from some non-dimensional
space (e.g. the Atomspace) into an n-dimensional Euclidean space. This can be useful in an
AI context because some sorts of queries (e.g. “find everything similar to X”, “find a path
between X and Y”) are much faster to carry out among points in a Euclidean space, than
among entities in a space with less geometric structure.

e Distributed Atomspace: An implementation of an Atomspace that spans multiple com-
putational processes; generally this is done to enable spreading an Atomspace across mul-
tiple machines.

e Dual Network: A network of mental or informational entities with both a hierarchical
structure and a heterarchical structure, and an alignment among the two structures so that
each one helps with the maintenance of the other. This is hypothesized to be a critical
emergent structure, that must emerge in a mind (e.g. in an Atomspace) in order for it to
achieve a reasonable level of human-like general intelligence (and possibly to achieve a high
level of pragmatic general intelligence in any physical environment).

e Efficient Pragmatic General Intelligence: A formal, mathematical definition of general
intelligence (extending the pragmatic general intelligence), that ultimately boils down to:
the ability to achieve complex goals in complex environments using limited computational
resources (where there is a specifically given weighting function determining which goals
and environments have highest priority). More specifically, the definition weighted-sums the
system’s normalized goal-achieving ability over (goal, environment pairs), and where the
weights are given by some assumed measure over (goal, environment pairs), and where the
normalization is done via dividing by the (space and time) computational resources used
for achieving the goal.

e Elegant Normal Form (ENF): Used in MOSES, this is a way of putting programs in
a normal form while retaining their hierarchical structure. This is critical if one wishes
to probabilistically model the structure of a collection of programs, which is a meaningful
operation if the collection of programs is operating within a region of program space where
syntax-semantics correlation holds to a reasonable degree. The Reduct library is used to
place programs into ENF.

Jeffrey Epstein. Finally, desperately, he tried to sell the informa-
tion he'd stolen.

The papers named underage girls and the places where
Epstein had taken them. The list included locations in Califor-
nia, Paris, New Mexico, New York, and Michigan. The papers
also included the names, addresses, and phone numbers of
famous individuals—Henry Kissinger, Mick Jagger, Dustin Hoff-
man, Ralph Fiennes, David Koch, Ted Kennedy, Donald Trump,
Bill Richardson, Bill Clinton, and former Israeli prime minister
Ehud Barak among them.

This was intriguing, if not at all damning. Epstein made a
habit of collecting such information for future use. But informa-
tion pertaining to the girls would have bolstered the state’s case
against Jeffrey Epstein, and by withholding it from the Palm
Beach PD and the FBI, Rodriguez had committed a crime.

In his defense, Rodriguez would say that the papers were an
“insurance policy.” Without them, he believed, Epstein would

have made him “disappear.”

But now Rodriguez needed the money. And so a few weeks q
after Epstein’s release from the Stockade, he approached a lawyer ~
who was representing some of Epstein’s masseuses. He had the F

government that the area around the temple’s surviving Western Wall, left uncared
for under the Jordanians, was cleared and a stone plaza put in place for worshipers
—at the expense of parts of the old Moroccan Quarter. It was under Labor, too, that
Israel unilaterally expanded Jerusalem’s city limits to take in more than two dozen
adjacent Arab villages on the West Bank. No Israeli government since then, Labor
or Likud, had deviated from a shared pledge that Jerusalem would remain Israel’s
undivided, sovereign capital under any eventual peace agreement.

Yet when I met Clinton the next morning in Laurel Lodge, he insisted we had to
find some room for flexibility. He said that, of course, Israel would retain
sovereignty over the Temple Mount: the site of the Western Wall and, above it, the
Al-Aqsa mosque complex. “But without damaging your sovereignty,” he argued,
“we have to find a way to draw a picture for Arafat that includes some measure of
Palestinian control in part of the city.”

“Could you agree to Arafat having an office, maybe, inside the walls of the Old
City,” he asked me. What about a form of administrative control in some of the
outlying Arab neighborhoods in East Jerusalem? I replied that I couldn’t possibly
answer any of his questions until and unless it was clear that Arafat accepted our
sovereignty over — and our national and religious connection with — the Temple
Mount. Yet I said I understood that we would have to reach some compromise
agreement on the city if we were ever going to have a chance of a peace
agreement. “But it’s an issue that is difficult for every Israeli,” I told him. Before I
could even begin to see whether there was a way forward, I would have to take it
through with my entire negotiating team. Then, we could discuss it.

It turned out to be the most open, serious, searching discussion I was a part of
during all my years in public life. It began, on the terrace of my cabin, at two in the
afternoon and went on until sundown. I introduced it by saying what each of us
already knew: Jerusalem was the most emotionally charged and politically
complex issue of all. Our maximum position coming into the summit had been that
we would again expand the municipal boundaries of the city, as we’d done after
the 1967 war, in order to accommodate two separate “city councils.”” One would be
in Abu Dis, just to the southeast of the Old City, almost literally in the shadow of
the Temple Mount. The understanding was the Palestinians would be free to
rename the village, referring to it by the Arabic name for Jerusalem: Al Quds. I
said that we should use that position as a starting point, and discuss how, or
whether, we might go further. All I added was the need to be aware of what was at

Newton's Rings

It turns out a single photon can interfere with itself! How can this
be? It must somehow split up and consider both the available paths
reflecting off the glass surfaces.

Now that we have these two concepts in our head, that a photon
sometimes reflects and sometimes does not, and a single photon must
consider both paths, we can ask: what tells the photon what to do?

There are only three possible answers: the light source that emitted
the photon, the pane of glass that reflected the photon or the observer
that saw the photon — me.

The first obvious place that might control the photon is the original
source of the photon; the light bulb. The photon might leave the bulb
already knowing what path to follow, whether it will be reflected and
whether that reflection will be affected by the gap between the two
surfaces in a positive or negative way. This is sometimes called a pilot
wave theory. The problem with this theory is I could insert a piece of
glass into the experiment after the photon has left the light source. This
will affect the photon but the light source could not have known my
intention in advance and told the photon what to do. Therefore, the path
of the photon is not pre-programmed by the light source.

Now our photon has left the bulb and is traveling toward the glass.
The glass has two surfaces. The photon reaches the first surface and has
to decide if it will reflect. But there is a problem. The second surface

inner game and being attractive by improving oneself will generally be a positive good.
Indeed, it could be argued that no PUA tactics are inherently abusive, but some are more
obviously susceptible to being used badly... the same way a sword is more obviously
susceptible to evil usage than a table.

Previous feminist writers have usually preferred to complain about the seduction
community's misogyny rather than examining the community deeply. I have been more
interested to see whether I could understand and make use of the positive PUA theories.
Understanding the Darth Vader types might be useful, too. There is a percentage of
PUAs who are non-consensually hurting women, and if we learn how those men do it, we
might also figure out how to disarm them.

I must acknowledge that I eventually felt that the community was damaging, poisonous,
and unhealthy for me -- to the extent that I needed to get out and detox. (PUA detox is a
recognized phenomenon even among some PUAs... and former PUAs.) However, there
are truths within it that are both intriguing and important.

I have never quite erased my fear of having my feminist card revoked, although it is not
clear how feminists -- a fractious group if ever there was one -- could withdraw my
presence in the movement. There is no Central Standards Bureau for feminists. Perhaps
inevitably, the feminist reaction to Confessions of a Pickup Artist Chaser was quite
mixed... although some other feminists appear to agree that there are important and
interesting things to learn from PUAs about gender, culture, and feminist consent models.

An overall lesson here might be that thinkers with a lot in common are increasingly
isolated from each other through the accelerating Balkanization of detailed, insular,
interest-based subcultures. Like the drive towards interdisciplinary research in academia,
perhaps a kind of interdisciplinary subcultural approach is being developed by those of us
more interested in building bridges than burning them.

I am writing in an attempt to make contact with Jeffrey Epstein and wondered if you would, as his attorney, forward this message on 
to him? 
We are keen to explore the possibility of conducting an interview with Mr Epstein, on the subject of the stories which are circulating, 
however inaccurately, about both him and Prince Andrew, the Duke of York; we'd be keen to hear from Mr Epstein first hand so that 
the various and at times, speculative reporting which is at large in the UK press can be better scrutinised? 
Let me tell you a bit about the Today programme. 
Today is the BBC's main morning news show; we have been part of the BBC for over 50 years and are generally considered one of the 
most important news broadcast outlets - either on radio or TV - here in the UK. We set the news agenda for the BBC and in many 
respects we set the daily news agenda for the country. Our interviews are regularly re broadcast across the BBC's national and 
international news network including - BBC World, BBC World Service and BBC Online. The combination of these outlets means 
the global 'reach of a BBC Today programme interview is second to none. 
Programme guests have included a selection of some of the biggest names in politics, business, international relations and the arts 
including US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, President Nicholas Sarkozy, President Hamid Karzai, HRH the Prince of Wales, 
former President Musharraf, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, former President Bill Clinton, Senator George Mitchell, Al 
Gore, Kofi Annan, former Prime Minister Tony Blair, the Dalai Lama, Bill Gates, George Soros, Stephen Hawking, Sir Paul 
McCartney, Mick Jaggar and Salman Rushdie. 
We are a programme that carries considerable weight and influence and which prides itself in being a first port of call for many of the 
most important and influential figures on the international stage.

alien to my rational mindset. (And I suspect, to my parents, if they even bothered to think about
it.) Everyone in the almost entire Jewish neighborhood (at least everyone who was part of the
modern Orthodox community) followed the rules. Few, I suspect, accepted the entire theological
framework that included the literal truth of the bible, the resurrection of the dead, heaven and hell
(which were not in the Jewish Bible) and the incorporeal nature of a single God. What we cared
about was the precise ingredients in a candy bar (no lard or gelatin), the number of steps you
could take if your yarmulkah fell off (more on this later), whether you could wear your house key
as a tiepin to avoid the prohibition against carrying on the Sabbath, whether it was permissible to
use an automatic timer—a “shabos clock”—to turn on the TV for a Saturday afternoon World
Series game, or whether you could ride on an elevator on Shabos if it automatically stopped on
every floor and required no pressing of buttons. The rabbis answered these questions for us, but
they didn’t always agree. My mother had little patience with most of the local rabbis because her
late father, who was not a rabbi, “knew so much more than they did,” and always resolved
religious disputes by accepting the approach that was “easiest” and most adaptive to the modern
lifestyle. Even my grandmother knew more than these “phony rabbis,” my mother would insist
contemptuously. My mother always said, “Respect people, not titles.” Then she was appalled
when I showed disrespect for my frequently incompetent teachers!

Most of the rules we were required to obey were negative ones: “Donts.” Don’t—eat unkosher,
drive or work on Shabas, eat anything on fast days, marry a non-Jew, eat ice cream after a hot
dog, wear leather on Yom Kippur, talk after washing your hands but before making a “motzie”
and eating the challah.

My grandmother—the enforcer—had a favorite Yiddish word: “meturnished’”—tt is forbidden to
do! She would shout it out in anticipation of any potential violation. If she saw you about to eat
a Nabisco cookie, she would intone the M word. If she saw you putting a handkerchief in your
pocket on Shabas, the word would ring in your ear. If you even thought about putting your
yalmulkah in your pocket, you would hear the word. Once I began to whistle a tune. My musical
effort was grated with a loud “meturnished.” “Why?” I implored. There’s nothing in the Torah
about whistling. “It is unJewish,” my grandmother insisted, “The Goyim whistle, we don’t.” It’s
now more than 30 years, since Grandma Ringel died, but the M word still rings in my ears every
time I indulge in a prohibited food or contemplate an un-Jewish activity (such as enjoying a
Wagnerian opera). Freud called it the “superego.” He must have had a Jewish grandmother too.

Of course we tried to figure out ways around these prohibitions—half of Jewish law seems to be
creating technical prohibitions, while the other half seems to be creating ways around them.
Much like the Internal Revenue Code. No wonder so many Jews become lawyers and
accountants. It’s not in our DNA; it’s in our religious training.

A story from my earliest childhood illustrates the extraordinary hold that religion—really
observance of religious obligations—held over all of us.

A few months before my brother was born, my father was holding my hand on a busy street, while
my mother was shopping. She had just bought me a new pair of high leather shoes—they went

above my ankles. For some reason, I bolted away from my father and ran into the “gutter.” My
foot was run over by an 18 wheeler truck. It would have been much worse had my father not

publicized self-immolation, and not a breach of a threshold in, say, the quality of life
of citizens or the level of corruption. This explanation requires simply that we rec-
ognize revolutions as a coordination problem (as argued in Morris & Shin, 2002;
Chwe, 2013), where each revolutionary chooses whether to revolt, and each is better
off revolting only if sufficiently many others revolt.

Quirks of Altruism and the Repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma
with Incomplete Information

The Repeated Prisoner's Dilemma has famously been used as an explanation for
the evolution of cooperation among non-kin (Axelrod & Hamilton, 1981; Dawkins,
2006; Pinker, 2003; Trivers, 1971). In this section, we show how the same basic
model can be used to explain many of the quirky features of our pro-social prefer-
ences and ideologies.

Recall that in the Prisoner’s Dilemma, each of two players simultaneously
chooses whether to cooperate. Cooperation reduces a player’s own payoffs by c>0
while increasing the other’s payoffs by b>c. The only Nash equilibrium is for nei-
ther player to cooperate. In the Repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma, the players play a
string of Prisoner’s Dilemmas. That is, after the players play a Prisoner’s Dilemma,
they learn what their opponent did and play another Prisoner’s Dilemma against the
same opponent with probability 6 (and the game ends with probability 1-6). As is
well known in the evolutionary literature, there are equilibria in which players end
up cooperating, provided 6>c/b. In all such equilibria, cooperation is sustained
because any defection by one player causes the other player to defect. This is called
reciprocity. As the reader is surely familiar, there is ample evidence for the Repeated
Prisoner’s Dilemma as a basis for cooperation from computer simulations (e.g.,
Axelrod, 1984) and animal behavior (e.g., Wilkinson, 1984). The model can be
extended to explain contributions to public goods if, after deciding whether to con-
tribute to a public good, players play a Repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma (see, e.g.,
Panchanathan & Boyd, 2004) (Fig. 5).

The key to understanding these quirks is that players often have incomplete
information. For example:

1. Players do not always observe contributions. It is intuitive that, for cooperation
to occur in equilibrium, contributions need to be observed with sufficiently high
probability.

2, Others cannot always tell whether a player had an opportunity to contribute. For
defection to be penalized, it must be the case that others can tell that a player had
the opportunity to cooperate and did not (.e. the player should not be able to hide
the fact that there was an opportunity to cooperate).

3. Sometimes, there are two ways to cooperate, and one has a higher benefit, b.
Then, the only way this more effective type of cooperation can be sustained in
equilibrium is if others know which cooperative act is more effective.

that would exclude the most important Sunni representatives. In mid-
December he participated in creating a Shiite grand alliance as the
launching pad for that government. The principal Sunni political leaders,
including Issawi, parliamentary speaker Osama al-Nujaifiand Anbari tribal
leader Ahmed abu Rishaannounced their intention to form their own
coalition. In short, Iraqi politics was re-fragmenting along sectarian and
ethnic lines even before the protests began.

Understood in this context, the Iraqi army’s killing of protesters in
Fallujah last month is a watershed event similar to the destruction of the
Askariya shrine in Samarra in February 2006, though the crisis will not
escalate as quickly. Sunni-Shiite tensions have hitherto played out in
political forums. The key actors in today’s crisis are not the Sunni political
leaders but, rather, Anbari tribal leaders, including Ali Hatem Ali
Suleiman, one of the most powerful leaders of Iraq’s largest Sunni tribe.
Suleiman and fellow leaders of the Dulaim tribe were essential to
engineering the Anbar Awakening in 2007 and Sunni participation in the
government, for which they rejected al-Qaeda in Irag and renounced
violence against the state. They responded to the killings of protesters last
month by threatening open war against the state for the first time since
2007. So far at least, they have restrained protesters and resisted violent
confrontation.

For his part, Maliki has sought to deescalate the conflict and to mollify
protesters. Tehran has also been working — to persuade Iraq’s Sadrists,

whom Maliki has alienated in his consolidation of power, to abandon their
support for their Sunni brethren. Their combined efforts appear to be
working: The Sadrist Bloc, which had refused Maliki’s request for
suggestions to replace Issawi and other Sunni politicians, has put forth a
substitute finance minister.

These efforts, ostensibly toward political resolution, actually increase the
likelihood of sectarian war by continuing the marginalization of Sunni
political leaders without addressing Sunni tribes’ core grievances — and
by re-creating a Shiite front that had splintered.

represent a headwind this year (see Exhibit

91). Meanwhile, any boost to emerging market
exports from the modest pickup in global growth
we expect is likely to be dwarfed by ongoing US
trade policy uncertainty, European political risk
and China fears. Lastly, an acceleration of recent
outflows from EMLD markets could magnify these
risks, particularly since 60% of the cumulative
inflows into the asset class since 2004 are
experiencing losses at current market levels.

Although the number of concerns is large, so is
the risk premium of the asset class. As previously
seen in Exhibit 76, the currencies in the EMLD
index are 15% undervalued. From this starting
point, the asset class could deliver attractive total
returns if US trade policy proves to be more benign
than feared and China worries abate.

Considering this balance of risks, our central
case calls for low single-digit returns. While
positive, this return is not sufficient to justify
a tactical long position in EMLD in our view,
given the still considerable downside risks
discussed above.

Emerging Market Dollar Debt

Emerging market dollar debt (EMD) returned 10%
in 2016, capping a surprising four-year period

of outperformance that has greatly benefited

from stable US rates and dollar strength. But the
prospects for a fifth year of upside are questionable
for several reasons.

First, EMD’s almost seven-year duration is
a liability in a rising-rate environment. This is
particularly true now that the Federal Reserve
has resumed tightening policy, a fact evident in
EMD’s 4.3% drop in response to increasing rate
hike expectations late last year. Second, with
spreads standing near two-year lows, there is scope
for spread widening based on US and European
policy uncertainty and renewed China growth
fears. Third, countries accounting for 37% of
EMD— including Mexico, China, South Africa
and Brazil—have negative outlooks from at least
two rating agencies, raising the potential for
downgrades.! A potential default by Venezuela
and its national oil company could also sour
sentiment, as could unfavorable tariffs or trade
restrictions from the new US administration.
Finally, the backup in interest rates we expect
could raise funding costs for EM corporate issuers,
which could also heighten concerns about spillover
into EMD. Indeed, a recent stress test by Standard
& Poor’s revealed that EM corporate borrowers—
who must repay $200 billion per year through
2020'*°—are twice as susceptible to downgrades
as US corporates if dollar funding costs rise by
a third.17?

Based on the above, we do not recommend a
tactical position in EMD at this time.

In Closing

WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE COMING YEAR WILL BRING AN END
to the prolonged run of positive performance for either the
US economy or the bull market for equities. Despite greater
uncertainties, including those tied to a new US administration,
the policy backdrop in the US will likely prove particularly
favorable for the economy, with looser fiscal policy, still easy
monetary policy and a lighter regulatory burden. As these
factors diminish the probability of recession in 2017, they
also support the case for clients remaining invested in global
equities at their strategic allocation. We believe US equity
gains are likely to be modest but still more attractive than the
comparable returns of investment alternatives such as cash
and bonds. And, as last year demonstrated, US equities often
surprise to the upside.

While we see the glass as half-full, there is no shortage of
risks—some of which have high probability and uncertain
impact for the year ahead—that could cause our forecasts for
the economy and asset class returns to miss the mark.

As always, we will adjust and communicate our views
accordingly should the economic, financial or geopolitical
backdrop change materially over the course of 2017.

Five-year-old Grace was a suspicious and dictatorial presence in the
Center’s kindergarten class. Articulate and righteous, she confronted children and
staff alike with evidence for the unfairness she found everywhere. In legalistic
defense of her rights and sometimes those of her peers, she used her strong wide
face, penetrating look and quick and observant mind aggressively. Her somewhat
intimidated childcare worker maintained Grace's cornrowed hair with care. Sensitive
to criticism and quick to anger, she competed with her teacher for control of the
class. Her drug abusing young mother had escaped from her own mother’s
authoritarian house, leaving six-month-old Grace in the care of her commanding
grandmother, a matronly church elder. Recent studies by David Reiss and
associates at George Washington University assessed psychosocial dynamics in
genetically varied families. They found that genetic similarities amplified the
expression of individual characteristics of interpersonal relating through what might
be called personality resonance. Relatives often commented that Grace and her
grandmother, being alike, deserved one another. Shortly after her fourth birthday
Grace was removed from her grandmother's home while the circumstances

“The initial impression was one of extreme confusion,” Greenwald
wrote in his book. “I was expecting to meet somebody in his six-
ties or seventies, someone very senior in the agency, because I knew
almost nothing about him prior to our arrival in Hong Kong.” His
initial confusion was understandable. Snowden, it will be recalled,
had falsely identified himself to them in an e-mail as a senior mem-
ber of the intelligence community.

Snowden led Greenwald and Poitras to the nearby elevator, and
they went through various corridors of the hotel to his room on
the tenth floor. It was mainly occupied by a king-sized bed, but it
also featured a sleek writing desk in the corner, two chairs, and a
modernistic lamp. The bathroom was behind a glass partition, which
could be closed off by a black louver blind. There was also a small
refrigerator in which Snowden asked them to stow their cell phones.

Snowden, as we know, had already told Poitras that he wanted
her to make a documentary of the meeting. She therefore wasted
no time in mounting her camera on a tripod. “Minutes after meet-
ing, I set up the camera,” she said. Snowden told her, “When you

© are involved in an action which is likely to get you indicted, you ®
typically don’t have a camera rolling in the room.” Nevertheless,
he allowed her to film his actions for the next eight days. One pos-
sible reason is that he had no intention of standing trial. In any case,
as Poitras found out, Snowden was anything but camera shy. Over
the next week, she would shoot over twenty hours of Snowden’s
activities in that small room. It was essentially a one-man show, a
presentation of him, by himself, for the appreciation of a global pub-
lic. Poitras knew virtually nothing about her subject until ten min-
utes before she began filming him. She had not even googled him,
because she was concerned that her Internet search might alert the
NSA and law enforcement authorities. In an over-the-top waiver of
his own privacy, he allowed her to film him washing in the bath-
room, preening his hair in the mirror, napping on his bed, getting
dressed, and packing his bag. He even permitted her to film a private
computer exchange between him and Mills (who was in Honolulu).
That day Mills informed Snowden that two government investiga-
tors had come to their home in Hawaii, asking her about Snowden’s
whereabouts. When he had failed to show up for work on June 3 it

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018667.txt,"Aside from the connection vs. control distinction, there is also a distinction between
PUAs who are seeking what is essentially self-help, and those who aren't.

The PUA concept that best illustrates this is inner game. Inner game is, essentially,
genuine confidence and sense of purpose. It contrasts with outer game -- 1.e., the things
a PUA says and does to attract women. A neg would count as outer game, for
example.

Most successful PUAs reach a point where they decide that, in the words of one coach:
emotionless sport-fucking kinda sucks. (Some PUAs start at this point, but that is a bit
unusual.) They conclude that it's time to pull back from the game; to seek longer-term or
more emotionally connected sex; to examine their priorities; and to discover interests
aside from picking up new girls. Finding themselves in this way can be described as
inner game. The men who discuss inner game often talk about developing their own
businesses, exercising regularly, keeping a healthier diet, accepting their own
vulnerabilities, pursuing hobbies, and improving their connections with people of all
genders.

Most PUAs also realize that women respond well to genuine confidence and sense of
purpose. This could be seen as ironic: notwithstanding the fact that inner game
emphasizes self-improvement, the concept is still centered on seducing women.
However, despite the fact that inner game is centered on gaming ladies, its ultimate
result is usually to encourage PUAs to think about what they really want from life. PUA
coach Mark Manson once wrote that, You don't end up in the Pick Up Artist community
unless you are incredibly unhappy or unsatisfied about something. It may be conscious, it
may be unconscious. It may be short-term, or it may be deep-seated and long-term. He
later wrote to me by email that: This is a giant self-help community in disguise.” I also
once interviewed Neil Strauss himself, who said he hoped that his famous book The
Game could become the beginning of a men's self-help movement -- because self-help
isn't emasculating anymore if you're doing it to get laid.”

Interestingly, Neil Strauss also told me that he agreed with feminism in many ways, and
said things like: We still are a patriarchal society. Many feminists felt that my interview
with him was full of problematic statements, and his words were picked apart by feminist
readers. I do not disagree with many feminist critiques of what Strauss said -- but
considering where Strauss was coming from, his words were extraordinarily supportive
of feminism. One feminist commented to me that, I don't understand why you're not
more critical of this guy. In response, it is worth noting how an anti-feminist writer
responded to Strauss's words:

Whether Strauss is an ignorant fool or an opportunist liar who wants to appease
feminists in order to avoid negative feedback is anyone's guess, but if his words are
anything to go by, we can safely assume that the best-known public advocates of Game
are perfectly OK with parroting feminist dogma.

For the few, mild pro-feminist statements Strauss made, some PUAs deride him as either
an ignorant fool or an opportunist liar. (Others hurled particularly misogynist insults
such as mangina.) This is both a demonstration of how vitriolic PUA anti-feminist
sentiment can become, and an example of the social shaming that sometimes leads men

addict. Riots break out and the child defends the local convenience
store. Another child born on the same road, but from a better
background, loots the store and is arrested. This scene played out on
the streets of London during the summer of 2011, but similar incidents
happen all across the world. People choose different moral paths; one
person makes a good decision; the other, a bad one. Did they make these
decisions freely or was their behavior inevitable, dictated at the dawn of
time?

Free will is at the heart of our justice system. It requires a crime to
be intentionally committed by a person of sound mind. If I kill you in
an accident or because I am mentally incapacitated, I am innocent. Of
course, if I mentally incapacitate myself with alcohol I would be guilty of
manslaughter, perhaps even murder.

Our justice system requires a crime to be intentionally committed
by a person of sound mind. Whenever we see something bad in the world
we trace the events back to the thought processes which led up to it. It
seems we punish the decisions in our brains leading to a crime, not the
crime itself. But, in a deterministic Universe my thoughts could never be
at fault. They are inevitable. “The Universe made me do it!”

You need not worry about the fabric of society falling apart in a
deterministic Universe. The whole of existence will play out according to
a predetermined script, complete with lawyers, trials, drama and pathos.
The judge, jury and executioner would also have no free will. It would
look as if you paid the price for the choices you made, but this would
be an illusion. The whole thing would be like one enormous screenplay.

The concept of determinism goes against our conscious experience.
We all have a strong sense of free will. I certainly think I have it! And this
presents a problem, because the classical laws of physics say our Universe
is entirely deterministic, and that free will is an illusion.

I should briefly mention ‘compatibilism, a branch of philosophy
that claims determinism is not at odds with free will. It argues that if
I feel free and my actions do not appear constrained, then I am free
even though my future might be inevitable: a sensation of freedom is
sufficient. This seems rather feeble. I am seeking an explanation for
how we might be truly free to choose our actions, not some linguistic
trick to argue freedom is subjective. I believe true free will is a physical
principle with observable effects on the Universe that would not be seen
in a determined one.

based, even though these other links can be processed via (e.g. PLN) logical inference via
interpreting them logically.

e Lojban: A constructed human language, with a completely formalized syntax and a highly
formalized semantics, and a small but active community of speakers. In principle this seems
an extremely good method for communication between humans and early-stage AGI sys-
tems.

e Lojban+-+: A variant of Lojban that incorporates English words, enabling more flexible
expression without the need for frequent invention of new Lojban words.

e Long Term Importance (LTI): A value associated with each Atom, indicating roughly
the expected utility to the system of keeping that Atom in RAM rather than saving it to
disk or deleting it. It’s possible to have multiple LTI values pertaining to different time
scales, but so far practical implementation and most theory has centered on the option of
a single LTI value.

e LTI: Long Term Importance

e Map: A collection of Atoms that are interconnected in such a way that they tend to be
commonly active (i.e. to have high STI, e.g. enough to be in the AttentionalFocus, at the
same time).

e Map Encapsulation: The process of automatically identifying maps in the Atomspace,
and creating Atoms that “encapsulate” them; the Atom encapsulation a map would link to
all the Atoms in the map. This is a way of making global memory into local memory, thus
making the system’s memory glocal and explicitly manifesting the “cognitive equation.”
This may be carried out via a dedicated MapEncapsulation MindAgent.

e Map Formation: The process via which maps form in the Atomspace. This need not be
explicit; maps may form implicitly via the action of Hebbian Learning. It will commonly
occur that Atoms frequently co-occurring in the AttentionalFocus, will come to be joined
together in a map.

e Memory Types: In CogPrime
this generally refers to the different types of memory that are embodied in different data
structures or processes in the CogPrime
architecture, e.g. declarative (semantic), procedural, attentional, intentional, episodic, sen-
sorimotor.

e Mind-World Correspondence Principle: The principle that, for a mind to display
efficient pragmatic general intelligence relative to a world, it should display many of the
same key structural properties as that world. This can be formalized by modeling the world
and mind as probabilistic state transition graphs, and saying that the categories implicit
in the state transition graphs of the mind and world should be inter-mappable via a high-
probability morphism.

e Mind OS: A synonym for the OpenCog Core.

e MindAgent: An OpenCog software object, residing in the CogServer, that carries out

some processes in interaction with the Atomspace. A given conceptual cognitive process

(e.g. PLN inference, Attention allocation, etc.) may be carried out by a number of different

MindAgents designed to work together.

e Mindspace: A model of the set of states of an intelligent system as a geometrical space,

imposed by assuming some metric on the set of mind-states. This may be used as a tool for

ormulating general principles about the dynamics of generally intelligent systems.

e Modulators: Parameters in the Psi model of motivated, emotional cognition, that modu-

ate the way a system perceives, reasons about and interacts with the world.

questionable ties to Tunisian oligarchs, corrupt presidents of
former Soviet republics, and Mu’ammar Gadhafi, among other

“The duke has a record of being loyal to his friends,” a “royal

Sarah Ferguson. If you are a prince and you bring a woman into

the royal life and, for whatever reasons, she’s spit out, you might
have feelings of debt toward her. The duke feels that she’s been
spattered and rejected. His close relationship with the Duchess
of York is problematic, and there have been many problems over
the last 5 to 10 years, all of which stem from the duchess. Some
of the behavior of the duchess is inconsistent with being mat-
ried to, or an ex-wife of, the duke. There's no question but that
Sarah’s been a financially self-destructive element in the-duke’s
life.”

“The same kind of loyalty manifested itself last December,
when the duke visited Epstein at his home in New York,” said a

spokesperson for Buckingham Palace. “Epstein was a friend of

the duke’s for the best part of 20 years. It was the first time in 7
four years that he'd seen Epstein. He now recognizes that the q

meeting in December was unwise.”

Palestinian architect of Oslo, was with him, along with a more junior aide who
served the tea and sweets. At least this time, Arafat didn’t take notes as we spoke.
The mood was friendly. We talked about a whole range of issues. With ony one
exception: what was really happening, or what should happen, in the summit talks.
I found the exercise disappointing as a result. But Yossi Ginossar assured me it
would help the atmosphere, and would eventually translate into negotiating
progress. “I hope so,” I said.

It wasn’t until day-four that real talks began. The Americans arranged for
negotiating teams from both sides on borders, the refugee issue, and Jerusalem to
meet with President Clinton. The Palestinians participated, but showed no sign at
all of a readiness to compromise. Borders should have been the most
straightforward. Assuming we wanted a deal, it was about sitting down with a map
and working out how to address both sides’ arguments. But Arafat’s representative
in the meeting — the Oslo negotiator Abu Ala’a — said he wouldn’t even discuss
borders without a prior agreement to land swaps ensuring Palestinian control over
an area equivalent to 100 percent of the West Bank. Shlomo Ben-Ami did try to
find a way around this. He suggested the Palestinians assume that to be the case for
the purposes of the meeting, so that at least there could be meaningful discussion
of the border, including the provisions Israel wanted in order to retain the major
settlement blocks. President Clinton agreed that made sense. He said that without
talking about the substance of such issues, there wasn’t going to be a deal. Even
Abu Ala’a seemed receptive, according to Shlomo. But he insisted that he would
have to ask Arafat first whether it was okay.

On refugees, pretty much the same thing happened. The Americans, and I
assumed at that point even the Palestinians, knew that a peace deal would be
impossible if we agreed to hundreds of thousands of refugees entering Israel — in
effect leaving the state created in 1948 with a Jewish minority. But when President
Clinton began trying to narrow down details of a compromise resettlement package
— how many refugees would return, where they would go, and how to arrange
international financial support for them — Abu Mazen insisted that nothing could
be discussed until without a prior Israeli acceptance of the “principle of the right of
return.” On Jerusalem, according to Gilead Sher, the President didn’t even try to
find common ground on the core issue: sovereignty. Instead he used the formula
Shlomo Ben-Ami had suggested, telling each side to proceed on the assumption
sovereignty was decided in its favour, and to concentrate instead on how everyday

for the layers. . as you talked about culling the unused neurons in each layer, each neuron in each layer 
would get dfferent ( kill yourself if you are not being used instructions ). 
Exactly. I looked up the statistics, black kids in the US have slower cognitive development (and never catch 
up), which the study of course attributed to social factors without any evidence, and they had faster motor 
development! I suspect this means their brains are slower at learning high-level concepts, because the low-
level structures are optimized for a shorter time. But they will keep the lead in motor development, because it 
is easier to learn, and they have more time and attention to practice once they get the structures in place. 
It could also be that they have an additional set of learning directives in place that adapts them better to a 
more hunting/running style of life, whereas the Europeans had to adapt for identifying long-term seasonal 
patterns, delayed gratification for agriculture etc. 
and CONCEPTS could be layer to layer communicaiton. . are gender differences also a matter of time, 
and structure of interactions. . 
I suspect gender differences are mostly motivational, i.e. we have a reward system for all the different social 
and cognitive needs, which makes us receive different kinds of pleasure and pain, thereby pay attention and 
learn. You cannot learn what does not attract your attention. Women tend to find abstract systems, conflicts 
and mechanisms intrinsically boring. Most women in computer science do not write programs because they 
enjoy solving puzzles, but because they want to help people, get approval etc. There are almost no women in 
math, because it does not help people or yield social attention. 
Men tend to find elaborate social relations boring. If there is no pleasure in observing and empathizing with 
people, one will not have good social cognition. 
IQ is not the only meaningful difference. Chinese pay an inordinate amount of attention to authority. I 
suspect historically., the authorities tended to kill them a lot if they did not. Jews tend be intellectually 
independent and anti-authoritarian, which might make them creative and inventive in ways that are hard to 
find in Asia. 
At the moment, I think speed/quality of brain development plus motivational system are the key to 
understanding both mind and individual differences. Important part of human language might be the result in 
a motivational need to discover/invent grammatical structure, which as a side effect makes us interested in 
music. 
It would mean that Chomsky's life long hypothesis, that people have a special circuit for grammatical 
language, is wrong. They might be GENERAL learners, just like Gorillas, but with a strong motivational 
urge to build grammatical structure, which the brain simply invents (there are only a few ways in which a 
natural language can work). That is much easier to wire into a brain than a specific circuit. 
i my self believe that african music, westrn music , chinese music are a window into the the structure of 
those layers. . western rigid, african primitve , chinese nature based, . I belive that synphoic movments

Making having children expensive in terms of upbringing and missed opportunity (like in the west) is a more 
humane way. Environmental stress while leaving near rock bottom tends to lead people to have more 
children, because there is no missed opportunity, and high mortality requires more attempts at procreation. 
Humans are a hardy species, outside of focused famine events and wars only small fractions of any given 
population die. 
I suspect that strong reductions in population will come from large-scale failure of agriculture. The climate 
change itself with result in migration and wars, but most people will probably survive that. But who knows, I 
might be wrong.

The radical idea of treating individuals in a society as cells and the society itself as a well-organized 
organism is fascism, or course. Probably the most efficient and rationally stringent way of governance, if 
someone could pull it off in a sustainable way; and if it is aggressive and expansive, its efficiency makes it a 
virus that everybody will want to stomp out. Fascism makes romantic doo-gooders like me very 
uncomfortable (I visited KZ Buchenwald five times and it had a profound influence on me; we East Germans 
inoculated ourselves very thoroughly against fascism), and the general public will not be willing to consider 
it. 
I rather like the treatment Fascism gets in the Amazon Series The Man in the High Castle, which explores 
what would have happened if the Germans and Japanese had won the war: A society that tries to function as 
a brutal and ruthlessly efficient machine, eliminating all social and evolutionary slack. It is very dark, but not 
a flat caricature of pointless evil for its own sake. Heinlein's late book Starship Troopers explores fascism, 
too, but unlike Philipp K Dick he does not see it as a form of insanity, but as the most desirable order. 
I find your political incorrectness very fascinating. In the beginning, I thought it is a form of costly 
signaling, but now I think you are simply entirely unconstrained in your thoughts. How did you manage in 
your youth? Did you get in trouble, or did you keep your thoughts to yourself? I wonder what kind of person 
you want to transform into. 
It was interesting to notice that at the Forbidden Research conference, nobody managed to say anything 
remotely out-of line. One large discussion group wanted to address the question of whether democracy still 
works, and mostly expressed their disagreement with Trump. Ideology is like halitosis: easy to see in others, 
hard in oneself A speaker felt that the media stifle all criticism of Trump, another wanted to remove men 
and Elon Musk from government, and everybody strongly agreed that we need more diversity everywhere.

I noticed some time ago that Joi has remarkable public communication skills. He picks controversial, insight-
laden topics, but sanitizes them by carefully replacing the parts of content that would divide his audience 
with symbolic messages that everybody can fill with their own content in a way that resonates with them. 
The non-controversial parts will still be insightful. He manages to come across as very subversive, while 
rarely offending anyone (except the hard scientists, that miss hard substance). 
He also asks influential people and smart students or faculty to write parts of his essays and speeches for 
him. This invests them in his success, especially because he is going to reward and acknowledge them. Very 
few of his ideas are original, instead he is good at identifying and testing thoughts he reads or hears from 
others. 
I am still beset by the ruinous instinct that the goal of communication ought to be mutual understanding. Joi 
is right. Public communication is about reaching one's goals.

Dear Jeffrey, 
> wrote: 
thank you for your support and encouragement, even where I fail. 
Sorry for being such an embarrassment today. I will spell out today's argument a bit better and cohesive 
when I get to it. Also, I should have recognized that the main point I tried to make would trigger Noam 
(who was as always very generous, patient, kind and humble on the personal level, even though he did not 
feel like conceding anything on the conceptual one). Almost all of Noam's work focused on the idea that 
humans have very specific circuits or modules (even when most people in his field began to have other 
ideas), and his frustration is that it is so hard to find or explain them. 
I found Noam's hypothesis very compelling in the past. I still think that the idea that language is somehow a 
cultural or social invention of our species is wrong. But I think that there is a chance (we don't know that, 
but it seems to most promising hypothesis IMHO) that the difference between humans and apes is not a 
very intricate special circuit, but genetically simple developmental switches. The bootstrapping of cognition 
works layer by layer during the first 20 years of our life. Each layer takes between a few months and a few 
years to train in humans. While a layer is learned, there is not much going on in the higher layers yet, and 
after the low level learning is finished, it does not change very much. This leads to the characteristic bursts 
in child development, that have famously been described by Piaget. 
The first few layers are simple perceptual stuff, the last ones learn social structure and self-in-society. The 
switching works with something like a genetic clock, very slowly in humans, but much more quickly in 
other apes, and very fast in small mammals. As a result, human children take nine months before their 
brains are mature enough to crawl, and more than a year before they can walk. Many African populations 
are quite a bit faster. In the US, black children outperform white children in motor development, even in 
very poor and socially disadvantaged households, but they lag behind (and never catch up) in cognitive 
development even after controlling for family income. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026409 
Gorillas can crawl after 2 months, and build their own nests after 2.5 years. They leave their mothers at 3-4 
years. Human children are pretty much useless during the first 10-12 years, but during each phase, their 
brains have the opportunity to encounter many times as much training data as a gorilla brain. Humans are 
literally smarter on every level, and because the abilities of the higher levels depend on those of the lower 
levels, they can perform abstractions that mature gorillas will never learn, no matter how much we try to 
train them. 
The second set of mechanisms is in the motivational system. Motivation tells the brain what to pay attention 
to, by giving reward and punishment. If a brain does not get much reward for solving puzzles, the individual 
will find mathematics very boring and won't learn much of it. If a brain gets lots of rewards for discovering 
other people's intentions, it will learn a lot of social cognition. 
Language might be the result of three things that are different in humans: 
- extended training periods per layer (after the respective layer is done, it is difficult to learn a new set of 
phonemes or the first language) 
- more layers 
- different internal rewards. Perhaps the reward for learning grammatical structure is the same that makes us 
like music. Our brains may enjoy learning compositional regular structure, and they enjoy making 
themselves understood, and everything else is something the universal cortical learning figures out on its 
own. 
This is a hypothesis that is shared by a growing number of people these days. In humans, it is reflected for 
instance by the fact that races with faster motor development have lower IQ. (In individuals of the same 
group, slower development often indicates defects, of course.) 
Another support comes from machine learning: we find that the same learning functions can learn visual 
and auditory pattern recognition, and even end-to-end-learning. Google has built automatic image 
recognition into their current photo app: 
http://blogs.wsj . com/digits/2015/07/01/go o gle-mistakenly-tags-black-p eop le-as-gorillas-showing-limits-o f-
algorithms/  
The state of the art in research can do better than that: it can begin to imagine things. I.e. when the 
experimenter asks the system to dream what a certain object looks like, the system can produce a 
somewhat compelling image, which indicates that it is indeed learning visual structure. This stuff is 
something nobody could do a few months ago:

A machine learning program that can learn how to play an Atari game without any human supervision or 
hand-crafted engineering (the feat that gave DeepMind 500M from Google) now just takes about 130 lines 
of Python code. 
These models do not have interesting motivational systems, and a relatively simple architecture. They 
currently seem to mimic some of the stuff that goes on in the first few layers of the cortex. They learn object 
features, visual styles, lighting and rotation in 3d, and simple action policies. Almost everything else is 
missing. But there is a lot of enthusiasm that the field might be on the right track, and that we can learn 
motor simulations and intuitive physics soon. (The majority of the people in Al do not work on this, 
however. They try to improve the performance for the current benchmarks.) 
Noam's criticism of machine translation mostly applies to the Latent Semantic Analysis models that Google 
and others have been using for many years. These models map linguistic symbols to concepts, and relate 
concepts to each other, but they do not relate the concepts to proper mental representations of what 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026410 
objects and processes look like and how they interact. Concepts are probably one of the top layers of the 
learning hierarchy, i.e. they are acquired *after* we learn to simulate a mental world, not before. Classical 
linguists ignored the simulation of a mental world entirely. 
It seems miraculous that purely conceptual machine translation works at all, but that is because concepts are 
shared between speakers, so the structure of the conceptual space can be inferred from the statistics of 
language use. But the statistics of language use have too little information to infer what objects look like 
and how they interact. 
My own original ideas concern a few parts of the emerging understanding of what the brain does. The 
request-confirmation networks that I have introduced at a NIPS workshop in last the December are an 
attempt at modeling how the higher layers might self-organize into cognitive programs. 
Cheers!

Okinawa and Senkaku/Diaoyu Debates

The clearest case of covert meddling occurs far south of Tokyo in Okinawa, the
ancient island-kingdom which is geographically closer to Taiwan than it is to the
Japanese mainland. As late as 2015, prominent Chinese were asserting that the Ryukyu
Islands, which include Okinawa, belonged as much to Beijing as they did to Japan. In
large part, they based their argument on the fact that the chain was once a Chinese
tributary state. The two countries still hotly contest this island chain, known as
Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China. “I am not saying all former tributary states
belong to China, but we can say with certainty that the Ryukyus do not belong to
Japan,” wrote Luo Yuan, a retired and hawkish People’s Liberation Army general.’
Chinese scholars have argued that Japan’s annexation of the islands in 1879 was an
invasion and that the sovereignty of the island chain is thus open to question. For the
time being, the Chinese Foreign Ministry has not pressed this issue.

Hong Kong has long been a base for flag-waving Chinese activists agitating on the issue
of the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. Their appeals to a notion of Chinese brotherhood,
combined with the fact the group writes in traditional Chinese characters, suggests
that the main consumers of the Organizing Committee for the Ryukyus propaganda
may not be on mainland China. Instead, the Organizing Committee may well be
targeting supporters of the Kuomintang in Taiwan, where hard core supporters of
unification have become marginalized in mainstream politics, or overseas Chinese
communities.

It is of some significance that the same individuals who make up the Organizing
Committee are also listed online as serving in CCP United Front Work Department
positions in Hong Kong.? The Organizing Committee for the Ryukyus also has a robust
online presence, with both a website and a Weibo (similar to Twitter) account.* It is
worth noting, also, that the Hong Kong-based campaign to regain the Ryukyus has not
won any overt or consistent support from Beijing.

But the Hong Kong patriots’ campaign has the benefit of being aligned with anti-
Japanese sentiment in Okinawa itself, where both political leaders and the local media
are antagonistic toward Tokyo. The local discontent is directly related to the long-
standing presence of tens of thousands of US military personnel stationed on the
island and the ways in which they have interacted with the indigenous population.

Operating at arm’s length from the government, however, a cabal of self-styled
Chinese patriots in Hong Kong has openly agitated for the Ryukus (Senkaku/Diaoyu)
to be taken from Japan and to become part of China. The main group calls itself the
“Organizing Committee for the Ryukyu Islands Special Administrative Region of the

necessarily. Last summer, as equity markets rebounded in June and July,
Cyclical sectors actually underperformed. The thin grey line in the top chart
shows that Cyclical sectors have recaptured only a quarter of the
underperformance seen between March and August and thus provide a better
entry point. Position indicators suggest that investors are underweight
Cyclicals and overweight Defensives which is turn means that Defensive
sectors are more vulnerable to position unwinding.

We introduced an underweight in US equities in mid October to position for
the US fiscal cliff risk. Obama’s win makes it more likely that this risk will
intensify into year-end. Across regions we favor EM Asia and Europe vs. the
US. While the US is facing fiscal cliffrisks, Asian equities are benefiting
from concrete signs that economic activity is rebounding in China. European
equities are benefiting from greater improvement in financial conditions,
although they are more vulnerable to noise around the Greek and Spanish
issues.

Credit

US credit spreads edged wider in response to the fall in equity markets
following the US elections. US HG widened 7bp to 160bp, undoing around
half of October’s peak-to-trough moves. Similar moves registered in other
USD credit markets. At 107bp, the CDX.IG is now back to early-August
levels, even as the CDS-Bond basis moved back into negative territory with
corporate bond spreads again moving above CDS.

Credit spreads may be repricing the risk of a fiscal-cliff induced recession in
2013. For context, we expect the eventual outcome of the negotiations to lead
to about 2% of GDP in fiscal contraction, not enough to tip the economy back
into recession in itself, and considerably lower than the 4% drag under the full
enactment of all revenue raising measures and spending cuts currently set to
become law on Jan 1.

From our point of view, the elections confirm the status quo both in
Washington and in market conditions — i.e. we should expect more of the
same and it has been a great year for credit. Therefore, we see the current
dip as an opportunity to add risk, and expect spreads to continue to tighten
into year end, albeit at a slower rate than in recent months. We stay down in
quality and outline in GAZOS this week some relative value arguments for
Euro HY vs US HY. On that front, European credit shrugged off the election
outcome, tightening marginally in the HG space and widening very slightly in
the HY space.

Foreign Exchange

The post-US election drama is unfolding as expected. Four more years with
the same cast is delivering a higher USD versus most currencies but JPY due
to deleveraging ahead of the fiscal cliff, and lower USD/CNY forwards due to
avoidance of US-China trade conflict (see An FX guide to America’s toss-up
election, FX Markets Weekly, Nov 2). The only surprise has been that FX
volatility remains so subdued (VXY unchanged at 7.4%) in a week when the
trade-weighted dollar and equity volatility have rallied. Chalk it up to
positioning, as most indicators suggest that institutions investors entered the
US polls with aggregate USD positions close to flat.

Now, sausage-making season begins. US recession is guaranteed if the fiscal
cliff is enacted on schedule, and neither Congress nor the President welcomes

teaches them how to teach. In fact, professors are not qualified to
teach since they know nothing about teaching. They are hired by uni-
versities because of their research credentials, and teaching doesn’t
matter much. There is some lip service about the subject but no one
ever got hired at Yale as a professor because she was a great teacher
who did no research.

Here is a professor of computer science from a very highly ranked
Big Ten university (he does not want his name mentioned):

Every faculty member in the Department of Computer Science
at my university thinks that their small insignificant area is
important enough that all undergraduates must take a course in
it. When you add all those courses up there is simply no time
for a student to do anything other than take crazy courses in
subdisciplines represented by the faculty in the department.
Everybody’s course is a sacred cow. If you tried to put something
new in, something would have to come out, and no faculty
member wants his course to be eliminated.

Professors are not there because they are good teachers.

I certainly knew nothing about teaching when I became a profes-
sor at Stanford many years ago. But I hated seeing students bored and
miserable and started to think about what the problem was and how
I could fix it. Many professors do exactly this. They want to be good
at something they do regularly and their pride makes them into good
teachers. Not all professors do this, by any means. What does it mean
to become a good teacher in that context?

Professors are rated for their teaching ability. It is clear if one looks
at those ratings what the criteria are from the students’ perspective.
They rate the friendliness, fairness, enthusiasm, and even the “hotness”
of their teachers. These ratings have been studied extensively and
conclusions like this one are typical:

While student evaluations of faculty performance are a valid
measure of student satisfaction with instruction, they are not by
themselves a valid measure of teaching effectiveness. If student
evaluations of faculty are included in the evaluation process of
faculty members, then they should represent only one of many
measures that are used.!

even though they had been isolated from any network. This innova-
tion had provided President Obama and his national security team
an edge of which our adversaries were unaware from 2008 to 2013.
However, Snowden deliberately nullified this advantage in 2013 by
revealing this technology (which was published in The New York
Times and other newspapers). The vast number of documents that
he compromised contained many other secret sources and methods.

The full extent of the damage Snowden did may never be fully
known, even though the Department of Defense spent the better
part of a year, and tens of thousands of investigative man-hours,
trying to sort out just the compromised sources and methods per-
taining to military and cyber-defense operations. In addition to the
direct and significant cost to taxpayers represented by this investiga-
tion, one measure of how serious the loss has been was revealed by
Michael McConnell, the vice-chairman of the company for which
Snowden had worked at the time of the breach. McConnell stated
publicly, “Snowden has compromised more capability than any spy
in U.S. history.” McConnell had no obvious reason to exaggerate the

® loss because his company, Booz Allen Hamilton, was partly respon- ©
sible for the damage. It hired Snowden, as will be recalled, even after
its vetters had detected an untruthful statement in his application.
McConnell said, “This will have impact on our ability to do our
mission for the next twenty to thirty years.” By any measure, two
decades of lost intelligence is a steep price to pay.

To be sure, the practical value of peacetime intelligence about
the activities of adversary states is not always evident. What is far
clearer to the public is the value of intelligence that can thwart ter-
rorist attacks against subways, theaters, and other civilian targets.
We have seen that Snowden also deprived the NSA of much of the
effectiveness of its PRISM program by revealing it, through the arti-
cles published at his specific behest in The Guardian and The Wash-
ington Post that explained how it worked. This single revelation
compromised a system, duly authorized by Congress and the presi-
dent, that had been the government’s single most effective tool for
learning in advance about attacks in America and Europe by jihadist
terrorists.

even a little scary. Friends who admired his skills as a hotelier wondered why he just
didn’t remake the place, but he seemed cowed by the weight of the watchful eyes on him.

Kellyanne Conway, whose family had remained in New Jersey, and who had
anticipated that she could commute home when the president went back to New York, was
surprised that New York and Trump Tower were suddenly stricken from his schedule.
Conway thought that the president, in addition to being aware of the hostility in New
York, was making a conscious effort to be “part of this great house.” (But, acknowledging
the difficulties inherent in his change of circumstances and of adapting to presidential
lifestyle, she added, “How often will he go to Camp David?’—the Spartan, woodsy
presidential retreat in Catoctin Mountain Park in Maryland—“How ’bout never.”’)

At the White House, he retreated to his own bedroom—the first time since the
Kennedy White House that a presidential couple had maintained separate rooms (although
Melania was spending scant time so far in the White House). In the first days he ordered
two television screens in addition to the one already there, and a lock on the door,
precipitating a brief standoff with the Secret Service, who insisted they have access to the
room. He reprimanded the housekeeping staff for picking up his shirt from the floor: “If
my shirt is on the floor, it’s because I want it on the floor.” Then he imposed a set of new
rules: nobody touch anything, especially not his toothbrush. (He had a longtime fear of
being poisoned, one reason why he liked to eat at McDonald’s—nobody knew he was
coming and the food was safely premade.) Also, he would let housekeeping know when
he wanted his sheets done, and he would strip his own bed.

If he was not having his six-thirty dinner with Steve Bannon, then, more to his liking,
he was in bed by that time with a cheeseburger, watching his three screens and making
phone calls—the phone was his true contact point with the world—to a small group of
friends, among them most frequently Tom Barrack, who charted his rising and falling
levels of agitation through the evening and then compared notes with one another.

OOK Ok

But after the rocky start, things started to look better—even, some argued, presidential.

On Tuesday, January 31, in an efficiently choreographed prime-time ceremony, an
upbeat and confident President Trump announced the nomination of federal appellate
judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Gorsuch was a perfect combination of
impeccable conservative standing, admirable probity, and gold-standard legal and judicial
credentials. The nomination not only delivered on Trump’s promise to the base and to the
conservative establishment, but it was a choice that seemed perfectly presidential.

Gorsuch’s nomination was also a victory for a staff that had seen Trump, with this
plum job and rich reward in his hand, waver again and again. Pleased by how the
nomination was received, especially by how little fault the media could find with it,

What exactly can the administration do to hasten technological innovation besides hosting datapaloozas? The fact sheet
points to two proposals: one that requires money, and one that doesn't. A “First in the World” fund of $260 million,
presumably requiring congressional approval, would “test and evaluate innovative approaches to higher education that
yield dramatically better outcomes.” Education officials liken this to a $650 million “Investing in Innovation” fund created
under the 2009 stimulus law that has been used as seed money for experiments in K-12 education.

And the Education Department could cut regulatory barriers to innovation, whatever those might be. Education officials said
Friday that they plan to solicit ideas from colleges on what government rules are hindering innovation. Many educators
might say that red tape gets in the way of experiments in distance learning and degree programs not organized around the
traditional credit hour.

The fact sheet asserts: “The Department will use its authority to issue regulatory waivers for ‘experimental sites’ that
promote high-quality, low-cost innovations in higher education, such as making it possible for students to get financial aid
based on how much they learn, rather than the amount of time they spend in class.”

Massively Online And Offline Too: How MOOCGs Will Evolve In The Physical World
Giovanni Rodriguez — Forbes

| was at the airport about this time last Sunday, when | overheard a conversation that’s becoming quite commonplace. One
person was explaining to another what aMOOC was, but he couldn’t remember what the letters stood for. As someone who
regards himself as an amateur, ad-hoc, in-the-moment teacher, | felt compelled to help him out: “Massive. Open. Online.
Course.” He thanked me. Hehad been struggling to remember the “open” part of the MOOC message. And, even more
interesting, he had been struggling to remember the word “course.”

Over the past few months, more and more clients and partners have been coming to me to deconstruct not just the acronym
but also the attributes of MOOCs. So often in fact that | have decided to write a short series on the subject. There are many
things to say about both the true impact and hype about MOOCs in the larger narrative that’s emerging about disruption in
education. But from where | sit, what’s most important to note about MOOCs in 2013 is something that the acronym does
not yet capture: the massive disruption we’re seeing in education will be online and offline, too.

Experience

There are at least three reasons for this. And each of these reasons deserves at least one post, but I'll be super brief here.
The first is that the online experience of MOOCs will almost certainly evolve in a way that teachers, students, and staff will
look to find ways to meet with one another. This will either happen by design (by intent and with care) or it will happen
organically. Almost certainly, the producers of MOOCs will look to do this with some sense of design, while leveraging the
organic power of networks to grow by themselves. And if you have been following the evolution of MOOCs, you already
know that the online experience is still a work in progress. My business colleague, Chris Bennett — a behavior designer and
gamification expert — and | recently spoke about this: many are stuck in the old paradigm of delivering education to the
consumer, rather than leveraging the greatest assets of the new medium (co-creation, crowdsourcing, collaboration). By
redesigning the online experience to become more interactive, innovators in the MOOC world will see the possibilities for
offline experience.

Inventory

Another reason for thinking about physical space: while the world ponders the impact that the costs of higher education will
have on schools that are struggling to compete, the inventory of quality physical space that becomes available will appeal to
organizations that need it. A couple of years ago, | had the privilege of serving as an advisor to a White House initiative that
traveled the country meeting with leaders in large spaces in a network of state and community colleges. As a former
theater producer, | was impressed with the availability and quality of these spaces. In theater — and other kinds of shared,
quasi-spiritual, transformative experience — physical space is everything. Innovators in the MOOC world will get wise — if
they haven't already — to the existence of networks of spaces (there are many different networks, as | will showin a later

things that we are uniquely able to supply (intel) and use that as leverage for post

through that prism.

Perry: Going into Syria will not weaken Iran’s resolve to get nukes, but it will send
the message that the Admin is willing to act militarily. Not going into Syria will
send the opposite message and that is very dangerous.

pressure on Russia and then be prepared to go ahead without UN, but not yet.

have Iranian ‘pay back’ rather, Iran slowed down its nuke activity
2. Post Assad, need a peace keeping force. That will be critical. Post assad
Syria will be very, very unstable. Turks will look to stabilize their kurd
situation. Iran will adjust strategies towards Syria etc.

Ignatius We need to speak to Syrian people to let them know we are active.
Population movements towards sanctuaries (Alawite sanctuaries, Sunni

Sanctuaries etc.) will trigger atrocities.

Kahl. The fall of Assad may cause Iran to increase their nuke efforts. Do not
lose focus on Iran.

our will to act by friends and enemies.

peers, including royalty, politicians, academicians, businessmen, and/or other professional and personal acquaintances,” which,

Edwards elsewhere claims, are “categories Clinton and acquaintances of Clinton fall into.”

Police reports entered into the record go into stomach-wrenching detail about Epstein’s alleged exploits with the girls and women he
recruited and paid for massages that became sexual acts, and mention other women participating as well. Epstein’s longtime friend,
the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, is accused of taking part, while his personal assistant, Sarah Kellen, is described procuring young

woman for him.

But neither of those women has ever said a word about Clinton being involved. Maxwell, for her part, has never been deposed. She
canceled a deposition in 2010, claiming she had to return to England indefinitely due to family illness, but was soon thereafter

For her part, Kellen, who won immunity from prosecution along with Epstein in 2007, did sit for a deposition, but repeatedly pleaded

the Fifth, refusing to even say if she’d ever even met the former president.
Epstein’s much-discussed flight logs show fairly conclusively that she has.

A review of the handwritten documents shows Clinton taking 13 trips in Epstein’s specially outfitted Boeing 727, including a much-
discussed trip to Africa with Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker. In every single instance, the logs show, Kellen was also on the plane, as
was Epstein. That may sound suspicious, except for the fact that Kellen has been described as Epstein’s right hand, profoundly
involved in his professional activities as well as personal ones. Indeed, Doug Band, Clinton’s personal aide, was on all but one of the

flights the former president took on Epstein’s jet.

A. lt was a title of prestige and achievement.

nothing really to do with the finances or hierarchy of

A. They got paid more generally, but it did not
have anything to do with distributions.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016954.txt,"Alison Gopnik is an international leader in the field of children’s learning and
development and was one of the founders of the field of “theory of mind.” She has
spoken of the child brain as a “powerful learning computer,” perhaps from personal
experience. Her own Philadelphia childhood was an exercise in intellectual
development. “Other families took their kids to see The Sound of Music or Carousel; we
saw Racine ’s Phaedra and Samuel Beckett’s Endgame,” she has recalled. “Our family
read Henry Fielding’s 18th-century novel Joseph Andrews out loud to each other around
the fire on camping trips.”

Lately she has invoked Bayesian models of machine learning to explain the
remarkable ability of preschoolers to draw conclusions about the world around them
without benefit of enormous data sets. “I think babies and children are actually more
conscious than we are as adults,” she has said. “They’re very good at taking in lots of
information from lots of different sources at once.” She has referred to babies and young
children as “the research and development division of the human species.” Not that she
treats them coldly, as if they were mere laboratory animals. They appear to revel in her
company, and in the blinking, thrumming toys in her Berkeley lab. For years after her
own children had outgrown it, she kept a playpen in her office.

Her investigations into just how we learn, and the parallels to the deep-learning
methods of AI, continues. “Tt turns out to be much easier to simulate the reasoning of a
highly trained adult expert than to mimic the ordinary learning of every baby,” she says.
“Computation is still the best—indeed, the only—scientific explanation we have of how a
Physical object like a brain can act intelligently. But, at least for now, we have almost no
idea at all how the sort of creativity we see in children is possible.”

witnessed firsthand--Mr. Johnson had actually placed his penis over the
railing of the yacht, bragging to onlookers, “Watch it touch bottom!” —-
Mrs. Kennedy could not help but shiver with disgust. Capitol Hill reporters
have observed the logical extension of Mr. Johnson boasting about his six-
o'clock-in-the-morning forays with Lady Bird, to his bursts of phallic
exhibitionism, whether it be on a boat or at the swimming pool or in the

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022849.txt,"also notable in the fixed hierarchy of who comes to whose turf, that everybody,
when they went to see Epstein, comes to him.

A week in late September, U.N. week as it happened, began, on Sunday, at
Epstein’s house with a colloquial for billionaires—Gates, Mort Zuckerman, and
Peter Thiel [TK].

Epstein, preternaturally responsive to both the price of oil and to the politics
of the middle of east, entertained that evening a delegation from Qatar, including
Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim, the foreign minister. Hamad, indeed, lives across the
street in a similarly furnished house—he and Epstein have the same decorator.
Epstein, in his relaxed and amused manner, kept prodding: “Why are you financing
the bad guys? What do you get out of that?”

The Qatarians, in some mild diplomatic discomfort, seemed most worried
that their bid for the World Cup might be compromised by bribery allegations.

At 9:00 next morning, Epstein is joined for breakfast in the dining room by
Reid Weingarten, who’s represented among other fat cats in trouble, Worldcom’s
Bernie Ebbers and Goldman Sach’s Lloyd Blankfein and is one of attorney general
Eric Holder’s closest friends. Weingarten, horse, with a cold, and dejected, is just
back from a failed defense of former Connecticut Governor John Rowland.

After a blow by blow of the trial, there’s a discussion of the Qartarian’s
visit—Epstein is serving chocolate made from pistachios grown on the Sheikh’s
farm—and speculation about who actually controls ISIS.

“Why?” I asked Weingarten, when Epstein briefly steps out of the room, “do
some many people keep coming back here, everything considered.”

“Why we camp out here? I guess because there’s no place like it.”

Epstein summons in the next person cooling his heels in the ante-room. It’s a
young man named Brock Pierce, a former child actor, and dotcom high flyer—a
principle in a gaming company called DEN, a notorious dotcom burnout, with its
own sex scandal—who is now a leading investor in Bitcoin. He describe himself as
the “one of the most active investors in the field.”

And, indeed, is the first clear explanation I actually get about Bitcoin. It is so
good that Epstein stops him and checks to see if his next appointment is here. And
seconds later, Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary and President of
Harvard, enters the dining room. Summers, off Diet Coke, digs deep into the
Sheikh’s chocolates, focuses in on the Bitcoin investor.

“Okay,” he says, after listening for a bit, “I have opportunities here. But an
additional feature of my decision problem roughly speaking is that the worst that
could happen to you is that you could lose all the money you put into it. Whereas I
could go from being seen as a figure of some probity and some intelligence to
being a figure of much less intelligence and much less probity...”

“Well,” says Pierce in some dramatic understatement, “it 1s true that you are

helping their own people, and they have continued to try to help their people.

Elie Wiesel's work is far more universal. For example, those who have

suffered most in the former Yugoslavia have been the Croats and the Muslims. It
was they who Elie Wiesel risked his life to protect. Yet during the Holocaust,
which took the lives of 6 million of Wiesel's people, the Croats were among the
most barbarous hands-on perpetrators of genocide against Jewish babies, women
and men. The Islamic world has been in conflict with Elie Wiesel's people over
Israel, and many innocent Jews have been murdered by Islamic co-religionists of
Muslims who have been terrorized in Sarajevo. Yet, Wiesel makes no distinctions
based on religion, race, creed or even enmity against his own people. He will
bear witness, even at the risk of his life, to the suffering of any human

beings, so long as they are not the aggressors.

To be sure, Elie Wiesel speaks up on behalf of his people as well, with a
voice of unparalleled eloquence.

A great Jewish sage once wrote, If I am not for myself, who will be for me?
But if I am for myself alone what am I? And if not now, when? Elie Wiesel lives
by that tripartite philosophy. He is the voice of the Jewish people - their
international moral spokesman. But he speaks not for Jews alone; instead, he can
be counted to combat hatred and bigotry regardless of who the victims may be.
And for Elie Wiesel, tomorrow is never an excuse for not acting today.

Over the years, we have worked closely together on issues relating to Soviet dissidents, the
Armenian genocide, the massacres in Rwanda and Darfur, efforts to delegitimate Israel and other
human rights concerns. I have sought his advice on many occasions, and it has always been wise
and useful.

In 1982, Elie was asked to present me with the William O. Douglas Award by the Anti-
Defamation League. In presenting the award, he paid me the highest compliment: “If there had
been a few people like Alan Dershowitz during the 1930's and 1940's, the history of European
Jewry might have been different.” Although I have always believed that these words were highly
exaggerated—no one could have stopped Hitler’s maniacal determination to kill the Jews of
Europe—I have tried to hold myself up to his expectations of me. I recall his words every time I
think of slowing down or doing less to protect the victims of human rights abuses.

In 19 __, Elie and his wife, Marianne, invited me to their home in New York for an intimate dinner
with French President, Frangois Mitterrand. Elie and his wife speak fluent French but I do not
and neither did the two other couples at the dinner. Mitterrand spoke passable English but he
insisted on conducting the entire conversation in French, with a British translator at his side. At
one point, Mitterrand told a joke in French. None of the French speaking people at the table
laughed. His translator then repeated it in English and everyone laughed hysterically. I asked Elie

I never feel like less of an American than when a President lies, and his supporters applaud.

Sometimes it takes the experience of shame to galvanize change, and this is such a time. Having lived too long
on the self-image of America is the greatest, richest, most powerful country in the world, we produced
Trumpism, which has shattered that image. It's been a traumatic experience. Mature adults are supposed to be
resilient in the face of difficult challenges, but a person can bend only so far. That's why one sees an outraged

Resistance, moving from He's not my President to Is this even my country?

If as we often hear, America isn't a place on the map but an idea, the idea is in trouble. Every day I'm reminded
of Sinclair Lewis's 1935 novel, Jt Can Happen Here, which imagined the election of a Fascist to the
presidency. As tumultuous as the Thirties were, fascism didn't happen here. In fact, the New Deal and the
inception of a social safety net came about. But reactionary forces simmer away when they aren't at a boil. Who
would have thought that the leader of the House in 2018 wants to weaken the social safety net by saving

Social Security and Medicare?

A survey of 117 historians recently ranked Donald Trump the worst President in history, which seems right
after only one year in office. But what makes me feel like less of an American is knowing that 40% of my
fellow citizens love and approve of him, who have reservations, yes, but overall want his agenda to move ahead.
In the daily fire hose of presidential offenses, little attention was paid to the revelation by Reince Priebus,
former White House chief of staff, that however chaotic this Presidency looked from the outside, it was worse

on the inside--fifty times worse.

Trumpism is the product of collective consciousness, and although one hears about the wisdom of crowds, but
when collective consciousness veers as close to lunacy as this administration, healing is the only answer.
Reactionary forces, racists, white supremacists, and haters are like algae on the surface of a pond. Algae only
appears if the pond is dank and still. When water is clear and flowing, there is no condition for algae to thrive

in.

The remedies for healing America are flowing with more force than before. Notions like Medicare for all, free
higher education, and bringing huge banks to heel were semi-fantasy in the last Presidential election. Now they
are quickly moving mainstream. Ecological awareness is growing and unstoppable. There is a possibility that by
destroying America's self-image, Trumpism has opened the way for facing reality, which after all is better than

living up to a self-image that is hollow at the core.

When you say that the room was hidden, Virginia, how was the room concealed?

It wasn’t like a door that you would normally go into, like some kind of special opening,
you open that and then a little door, so it looks like it’s a little closet so-to-speak, but
when you walk in there, it’s obviously a lot bigger than just a closet. It wasn’t too big,
but it was bigger, you know. It wasn’t a gigantic room, it was just like a small room,
which you know, it probably could fit some shoes in there, it had racks of shoes, boxes,
some sweatshirts neatly folded, and the ceiling to the floor was covered in pornographic
pictures of the girls that he had met.

When you say...

So anyways, that was getting there, and I was introduced to Jeffrey, he was laying naked
on top of the massage table, and obviously for one, I’m a 15 year old girl and seeing him
on the table was weird but, also learning about anatomy and massage, I thought this
would be part of it. So obviously, I thought it was part of the massage program, so I said
ok, this is fine. And, he then instructed me on how to touch the body, Jeffrey’s body,
how to massage him, and for the first hour, it was actually a real massage, maybe not an
hour, maybe like 40 minutes or something, but of something like that _and that’s when he
turned over on the other side and to expose himself fully. So then Ghislaine told me that
she wanted me to undress and began to take off my shirt and skirt, my white uniform
from Mar-A-Lago, she also took off her shirt and got undressed, and so I was there with
just my undies on, and she was completely bare, and made some kind of little flake about
the underwear that I was wearing because it wasn’t my normal sexy girl underwear and
just like, I don’t know, had red hearts on it or something like that; just your normal, you
know, real cute underwear. Anyways, so during all of this I’m kind of like what’s going
on, how do I act, what do I say, I was so afraid of, not afraid or fearful for my life but
_unsure of how all this started and wanting to obtain a profession_ I was so aftaid
thinking about upsetting and disappointing them, I don’t know, it’s a weird situation by
far and I was expected to Lick his nipples, instructed on how to do so by J.E_ and give
him oral sex while he wanted to fondle me, and then at the end, I was told by Ghislaine to
get on top and straddle Jeffrey sexually, and when we were done, we went and had a
shower in the room and Jeffrey told me to wash him up and down, you know with a bar
of soap and make sure he was all cleaned up. And then he took me downstairs and took
me to two of the guards and told John to bring me home. John was the butler at the time.

Let me interrupt you for just a moment there if I could, Virginia. You mentioned as you
were recounting those details that you were 15 years old at the time. What is your date of

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016940.txt,"problems, it often takes only a couple of noisy data points to get something that’s a
beautiful description of a phenomenon, because you’re putting in knowledge about how
physics works. That’s in huge contrast to normal AI, which requires millions of training
examples and is very sensitive to noise. By adding the appropriate background
knowledge, you get much more intelligence.

Similar to the physical-systems case, if we make neurons that know a lot about
how humans learn from each other, then we can detect human fads and predict human
behavior trends in surprisingly accurate and efficient ways. This “social physics” works
because human behavior is determined as much by the patterns of our culture as by
rational, individual thinking. These patterns can be described mathematically and
employed to make accurate predictions.

This idea of a credit-assignment function reinforcing connections between
neurons that are doing the best work is the core of current AI. If you make those little
neurons smarter, the AI gets smarter. So, what would happen if we replaced the neurons
with people? People have lots of capabilities. They know lots of things about the world;
they can perceive things in a broadly competent, human way. What would happen if you
had a network of people in which you could reinforce the connections that were helping
and minimize the connections that weren’t?

That begins to sound like a society, or a company. We all live in a human social
network. We’re reinforced for doing things that seem to help everybody and discouraged
from doing things that are not appreciated. Culture is the result of this sort of human AI
as applied to human problems; it is the process of building social structures by
reinforcing the good connections and penalizing the bad. Once you’ve realized you can
take this general AI framework and create a human AI, the question becomes, What’s the
right way to do that? Is it a safe idea? Is it completely crazy?

My students and I are looking at how people make decisions, on huge databases
of financial decisions, business decisions, and many other sorts of decisions. What we’ve
found is that humans often make decisions in a way that mimics AI credit-assignment
algorithms and works to make the community smarter. A particularly interesting feature
of this work is that it addresses a classic problem in evolution known as the group-
selection problem. The core of this problem is: How can we select for culture in
evolution, when it’s the individuals that reproduce? What you need is something that
selects for the best cultures and the best groups but also selects for the best individuals,
because they’ re the units that transmit the genes.

When you frame the question this way and go through the mathematical literature,
you discover that there’s one generally best way to do this. It’s called “distributed
Thompson sampling,” a mathematical algorithm used in choosing, out of a set of possible
actions with unknown payoffs, the action that maximizes the expected reward in respect
to the actions. The key is social sampling, a way of combining evidence, of exploring
and exploiting at the same time. It has the unusual property of simultaneously being the
best strategy both for the individual and for the group. If you use the group as the basis
of selection, and then the group either gets wiped out or reinforced, you’re also selecting
for successful individuals. If you select for individuals, and each individual does what’s
good for him or her, then that’s automatically the best thing for the group. It’s an
amazing alignment of interests and utilities, and it provides real insight into the question
of how culture fits into natural selection.

particularly since other diplomatic possibilities have not yet been
exhausted.

Similarly, sanctions, while effective, are not sufficient by themselves.
They must be intertwined with negotiations -- as Washington and its allies
increase the pressure, cohesive and meaningful talks with equivalent
concessions should follow suit. Some have argued that negotiations should
expand to a big for big format, but decades of mistrust between the
United States and Iran make smaller deals more practical. Such an
approach would have to focus on ending Iran's most problematic
enrichment activity: processing uranium to the 20 percent threshold, which
makes the leap to weapons-grade material much easier. Instead, the regime
could limit itself to 5 percent enrichment, and under strict supervision by
the International Atomic Energy Agency.

The intelligence community widely believes that although Iran has not yet
decided to make a nuclear weapon, it is still moving to acquire all the
necessary capabilities in case it chooses that path. Accordingly,
Washington will need to obtain a concrete Iranian commitment to convert
its stocks of readily upgradeable gaseous uranium into metallic fuel
elements, which pose significantly less of a threat. A serious inspection
system would need to be implemented in order to monitor these
requirements. In return, the Iranians would expect the lifting of nuclear-
related sanctions. They would also likely ask for acknowledgement that
they have the right to continue their civil enrichment program, whether for
supposed use in cancer treatment or to safeguard against a potential
Russian decision to cease fueling the Bushehr reactor.

Thus far, President Obama has been frustrated at the lack of progress in
response to his openness toward the Iranian regime, and his new cabinet
has an obligation to help him solidify a negotiating position that improves
the situation. If the Iranians continue to reject U.S. positions that
seemingly respond to some of their demands, then the administration
should begin applying other pressures. These steps should be taken sooner

Broward Probe: 302 Reasons Not To Talk To The FBI

The newspapers and Browardbeat.com make clear that the Federal investigations that led to the arrests 
of County Commissioner Josephus Eggleston, former Miramar Commissioner Fitzroy Salesman and 
School Board member Bev Gallagher are just beginning. 
The FBI will be interviewing everyone from County Administrator Bertha Henry to bus drivers about 
anything and everything. 
They are looking for scalps. 
I suspect that if the average person thought about it, he would assume that when the FBI comes calling, 
like Joe Friday from DRAGNET, they want the facts and nothing but the facts. Equally important 
they want an accurate record of that interview so they bring a court reporter or at the very least a tape 
recorder. 
The average person would be wrong. 
Agents bring a pencil and pad to take notes. They then prepare a summary of the interview called a 
302 Report. 
If you are called as a witness at trial, prior to testifying, you will be given a copy ofYour 302 to 
review. It is a record of what the FBI insists you said at your previous meeting. 
If your interview lasted more than thirty seconds, it is guaranteed you will find numerous discrepancies. 
Some of them will be insignificant; some of them could be material. 
Ask two people to listen to you in a discussion about a traffic accident and then write a summary. It is a 
guaranteed they will have differences with each other as well as with you, the witness. 
You said, I am reasonably sure that the traffic light was green. 
One report takes out the equivocation and quotes you as saying: The light was green. 
This brings us to Federal law 18 USC 1001. That statute makes it a felony to lie to the government. And 
guess who decides whether or not you were lying? The government. 
So here is your conundrum. Do you testify about your doubts about the light, which is the truth, or do 
you adopt the 302 version to avoid the wrath of the FBI? 
Whether or not the 302 discrepancies are a result of stupidity or cupidity makes no difference. 
Testify in opposition to the 302 and you are in the crosshairs of the Feds. 
If they believe your testimony cost them the case, the next thing you likely to hear from the FBI will be: 
Please place your hands behind your back. 
A number of years ago, fed up with the 302 Two Step, I turned the tables on them.

In a high profile case, my client was asked to submit to an FBI interview at their offices in North Miami 
Beach. 
Feigning naivety, I asked where the court reporter was. I was told there was no court reporter. 
I then asked where the tape recorder was. 
I will always be impressed that the agent was able to give us the response he did without laughing. He 
said the FBI could not tape the interview because they did not have enough money in their budget. 
It was time to play the Trump Card. 
At that point, I removed a cassette recorder from my pocket and explained that my client had been able 
to scrape together the 59 cents for a cassette tape. Further we would pay for the tape to be transcribed 
and supply them with al free copy of everything. 
You could've heard a fart in a vacuum. 
They now made it clear that no way, no how would any FBI interview be recorded. So we went forward 
with the interview as the agent took notes. 
Months later the client was called to testify at trial. 
I warned him the 302 would be a work of fiction. It was. I was sitting in the back of the courtroom. 
Called to the stand, he told the real truth and not the 302 version of the truth. The Assistant U.S. 
Attorney was frustrated and kept on confronting him with the 302 version. 
Fed up with the prosecutor and in the presence of the jury, the witness preceded to recount my debate 
over recording from the first interview. Pointing to me in the back of the courtroom, the witness 
announced that I had warned him that they would pull this crap with the 302 report. 
It didn't take the jury very long to acquit. 
With the advent of DNA and groups like the Innocence Project, we have now seen that so-called 
unrecorded confessions have put many innocent people in jail and even on Death Row. As a result, 
agencies such as the BSO, now require all interviews to be taped. 
But not the FBI. 
Like anyone, including lawyers, the FBI wants to control the record of the interview. Taping hurts that 
effort. 
I'm not saying that it is FBI policy to step over the line. But they have chalk on their shoes more often 
than you can imagine.

So, what's should you do if the FBI comes calling? 
First of all, the advice I am about to give is not for the a guy who was an inadvertent witness to a bank 
robbery. 
I am talking about people who are being interviewed as part of the types of crimes that are best 
described as corruption, RICO, white collar, etc. 
Those are the kinds of cases that involve tons of evidence. Giving an innocent, but incorrect answer to a 
vague question could leave any of us in deep CaCa. 
A case in point is the lead story in the September 26, 2009 Herald. Chris Walton, director of the 
Broward County Transportation Department, was interviewed by two FBI agents. 
He stated that they wanted to know if commissioners attempted to influence contracts. 
I told them no. 
It may sound like a simple straight forward Q-and-A but it ain't necessarily so. He may think his 
interview and public statement ends the matter. 
In actuality, he has thrown down the gauntlet in front of the FBI. 
Start out with the understanding that the FBI is not investigating to see if there is crime and corruption in 
Broward County government. They already believe there is. They are only trying to uncover evidence to 
confirm their beliefs. 
Walton's blanket defense of the Commission has made the Feds conclude he is a fool or co-conspirator. 
The FBI just needs the evidence and not much of it. To quote the late Supreme Court Justice William 
Brennan: any prosecutor worth his salt could indict a ham sandwich. 
This means all evidence, regardless of its ambiguous nature, will be interpreted to support their 
assumption of wrongdoing. 
They will be using software to go through millions of E-mail messages to look for key words. As Buddy 
has quoted me: The 'E' in E-mail stands for evidence. 
So imagine the following scenario. 
Six months from now they uncover an E-mail from the County Manager to Walton stating that 
Commissioner X wants to know if the bid of company Y for new busses was correctly filled out. He 
replies that it was.

Months later he has totally forgotten about the innocuous E-mail. Based on the merits, he happens to 
rank Y's bid number one. 
You can bet as sure as J. Edgar Hoover wore pink poodle skirts, the FBI will conclude this was code 
from Commissioner X to Walton to vote for Y. 
Armed with the E-mail you can be damn sure that the G-Men will be back threatening him with 
everything including a stint in Gitmo. 
All of this might have been avoided if he had followed my three basic rules. 
Memorize them.

Walton's blanket defense of the Commission has made the Feds conclude he is a fool or co-conspirator. 
The FBI just needs the evidence and not much of it. To quote the late Supreme Court Justice William 
Brennan: any prosecutor worth his salt could indict a ham sandwich. 
This means all evidence, regardless of its ambiguous nature, will be interpreted to support their 
assumption of wrongdoing. 
They will be using software to go through millions of E-mail messages to look for key words. As Buddy 
has quoted me: The 'E' in E-mail stands for evidence. 
So imagine the following scenario. 
Six months from now they uncover an E-mail from the County Manager to Walton stating that 
Commissioner X wants to know if the bid of company Y for new busses was correctly filled out. He 
replies that it was. 
Months later he has totally forgotten about the innocuous E-mail. Based on the merits, he happens to 
rank Y's bid number one. 
You can bet as sure as J. Edgar Hoover wore pink poodle skirts, the FBI will conclude this was code 
from Commissioner X to Walton to vote for Y. 
Armed with the E-mail you can be damn sure that the G-Men will be back threatening him with 
everything including a stint in Gitmo. 
All of this might have been avoided if he had followed my three basic rules. 
Memorize them. 
1. Do not talk to the FBI without a lawyer.

Subject: Sam Fields on 302 Interview 
Broward Probe: 302 Reasons Not To Talk To The FBI 
BY SAM FIELDS 
Guest Columnist 
Actually, there are not 302 reasons. There is but one and it is called in federal court The 302. It 
could screw the innocent and the unwary. 
The newspapers and Browardbeat.com make clear that the Federal investigations that led to the arrests 
of County Commissioner Josephus Eggleston, former Miramar Commissioner Fitzroy Salesman and 
School Board member Bev Gallagher are just beginning. 
The FBI will be interviewing everyone from County Administrator Bertha Henry to bus drivers about 
anything and everything. 
They are looking for scalps. 
I suspect that if the average person thought about it, he would assume that when the FBI comes calling, 
.like Joe Friday from DRAGNET, they want the facts and nothing but the facts. Equally important 
they want an accurate record of that interview so they bring a court reporter or at the very least a tape 
recorder. 
The average person would be wrong. 
Agents bring a pencil and pad to take notes. They then prepare a summary of the interview called a 
302 Report. 
If you are called as a witness at trial, prior to testifying, you will be given a copy of Your 302 to 
review. It is a record of what the FBI insists you said at your previous meeting. 
If your interview lasted more than thirty seconds, it is guaranteed you will fmd numerous discrepancies. 
Some of them will be insignificant; some of them could be material. 
file:///Cl/Documents`/020and%20Settings/Trial/Desktop/E...uction/eDocs/eMail/Grant Smith080178^eMailContent.htm (1 of 5) [11/6/2010 10:16:54 PM]

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030945 
Grant_Smith080178^eMailContent.htm 
Ask two people to listen to you in a discussion about a traffic accident and then write a summary. It is a 
guaranteed they will have differences with each other as well as with you, the witness. 
You said, I am reasonably sure that the traffic light was green. 
One report takes out the equivocation and quotes you as saying: The light was green. 
This brings us to Federal law 18 USC 1001. That statute makes it a felony to lie to the government. And 
guess who decides whether or not you were lying? The government. 
So here is your conundrum. Do you testify about your doubts about the light, which is the truth, or do 
-----------------------------------------------you adopt the 302 version to avoid the wrath of the FBI? 
Whether or not the 302 discrepancies are a result of stupidity or cupidity makes no difference. 
Testify in opposition to the 302 and you are in the crosshairs of the Feds. 
If they believe your testimony cost them the case, the next thing you likely to hear from the FBI will be: 
Please place your hands behind your back. 
A number of years ago, fed up with the 302 Two Step, I turned the tables on them. 
In a high profile case, my client was asked to submit to an FBI interview at their offices in North Miami 
Beach. 
Feigning naivety, I asked where the court reporter was. I was told there was no court reporter. 
I then asked where the tape recorder was. 
I will always be impressed that the agent was able to give us the response he did without laughing. He 
said the FBI could not tape the interview because they did not have enough money in their budget. 
It was time to play the Trump Card. 
At that point, I removed a cassette recorder from my pocket and explained that my client had been able 
to scrape together the 59 cents for a cassette tape. Further we would pay for the tape to be transcribed 
and supply them with a free copy of everything. 
You could've heard a fart in a vacuum. 
They now made it clear thaf no way, no how would any FBI interview be recorded. So we went forward 
with the interview as the agent took notes. 
Months later the client was called to testify at trial. 
I warned him the 302 would be a work of fiction. It was. I was sitting in the back of the courtroom.

Called to the stand, he told the real truth and not the 302 version of the truth. The Assistant U.S. 
Attorney was frustrated and kept on confronting him with the 302 version. 
Fed up with the prosecutor and in the presence of the jury, the witness preceded to recount my debate 
over recording from the first interview. Pointing to me in the back of the courtroom, the witness 
announced that I had warned him that they would pull this crap with the 302 report. 
It didn't take the jury very long to acquit. 
With the advent of DNA and groups like the Innocence Project, we have now seen that so-called 
unrecorded confessions have put many innocent people in jail and even on Death Row. As a result, 
agencies such as the BSO, now require all interviews to be taped. 
But not the FBI. 
Like anyone, including lawyers, the FBI wants to control the record of the interview. Taping hurts that 
effort. 
I'm not saying that it is FBI policy to step over the line. But they have chalk on their shoes more often 
than you can imagine. 
So, what's should you do if the FBI comes calling? 
First of all, the advice I am about to give is not for the a guy who was an inadvertent witness to a bank 
robbery. 
I am talking about people who are being interviewed as part of the types of crimes that are best 
described as corruption, RICO, white collar, etc. 
Those are the kinds of cases that involve tons of evidence. Giving an innocent, but incorrect answer to a 
vague question could leave any of us in deep CaCa. 
A case in point is the lead story in the September 26, 2009 Herald. Chris Walton, director of the 
Broward County Transportation Department, was interviewed by two FBI agents. 
He stated that they wanted to know if commissioners attempted to influence contracts. 
I told them no. 
It may sound like a simple straight forward Q-and-A but it ain't necessarily so. He may think his 
interview and public statement ends the matter. 
In actuality, he has thrown down the gauntlet in front of the FBI. 
Start out with the understanding that the FBI is not investigating to see if there is crime and corruption in

These precise tips for evading U.S. and British surveillance were
not accidentally leaked. Snowden supplied them in written answers
to interrogatives sent to him by Poitras and Appelbaum in May
2013 while he was still on the NSA payroll. He also carefully orches-
trated the exposure of the PRISM surveillance programs, precisely
specifying, as Greenwald writes in his book No Place to Hide, who
was to release the “scoops” in which newspapers. He gave Gellman a
seventy-two-hour ultimatum for exposing PRISM, as we know. He
further provided Poitras with well-organized files for publications
revealing, among other things, that the NSA had paid RSA, a lead-
ing computer security provider, to build flawed encryption protocols,
which allowed the NSA to read encrypted messages on computers
and online video games. In short, he used these journalists to accom-
plish his purpose. In light of the way he micromanaged the leaks, it is
difficult to conclude that he did not deliberately plan to compromise
and render useless these U.S. and British operations.

Whatever he intended, he clearly succeeded in blowing the cover
off NSA‘s operations authorized under the Foreign Intelligence Sur-

© veillance Act for monitoring terrorists’ activities. After all, terrorist ©
groups are no different from other criminal enterprises in their need
to keep their communications secret from the authorities pursuing
them. If they find out that the police are tapping their phone lines or
intercepting other channels of communication, they can be expected
to either stop using them or use them to divert attention away from
their real plans.

In addition, Snowden suggested an alternative means to those who
wanted to evade government surveillance. He recommended that
they use end-to-end encryption, which results in messages being
encrypted before they are sent over the Internet. He told Greenwald,
for example, that encryption was “critically necessary” for anyone
to evade NSA surveillance. Just as Robert Hanssen had deliberately
compromised the NSA’s interception of Soviet communications in
Washington, D.C., in the 1990s, Snowden deliberately compromised
the NSA’s interception of concealed messages by potential terrorists
on the Internet. We cannot know whether or not any of the jihadists
involved in subsequent terrorist attacks (such as those in Paris or
San Bernardino, California, in 2015) would have used the Internet

mentioned earlier. Both aim for specific terms when possible (“french sailor shirts” vs. “french shirts;”
“voga for sports” vs. “yoga”’) for higher conversion rates (the percentage of visitors that purchase) and
lower cost-per-click (CPC). They aim also for second through fourth positioning, but no more than $.20
CPC.

Sherwood will use Google’s free analytical tools to track “orders” and page abandonment rates— what
percentage of visitors leave the site from which pages. Johanna will use www.wufoo.com to track e-mail
sign-ups on this small testing scale4

Cost to both: $0.

Both Johanna and Sherwood design Adwords ads that focus on their differentiators. Each Google
Adwords ad consists of a headline and then two lines of description, neither of which can exceed 35

characters. In Sherwood’s case, he creates five groups of 10 search terms each. The following are two of
his ads.

SAILOR SHIRTS FROM FRANCE

SAILOR SHIRTS FROM FRANCE REAL FRENCH SAILOR SHIRTS
French Quality, Shipped from U.S. French Quality, Shipped from U.S.
Lifetime Guarantee! Lifetime Guarantee!
www.shirtsfromfrance.com www.shirtsfromfrance.com

Johanna creates the same five groups of 10 terms each and tests a number of ads, including these:

YOGA FOR ROCK CLIMBERS YOGA FOR ROCK CLIMBERS
DVD Used by 5.12 Climbers DVD Used by 5.12 Climbers
Get Flexible Fast! Get Flexible Fast!
www.yogaclimber.com www.yogaforsports.com

Notice that these ads can be used to test not just headlines but guarantees, product names, and domain
names. It’s as simple as creating several ads, rotated automatically by Google, that are identical except
for the one variable to be tested. How do you think I determined the best title for this book?

Both Sherwood and Johanna disable the feature on Google that serves only the best-performing ad.
This is necessary to later compare the click-through rates from each and combine the best elements
(headline, domain name, and body text) into a final ad.

Last but not least, ensure that the ads don’t trick prospects into visiting the site. The product offer
should be clear. Our goal is qualified traffic, so we do not want to offer something “free” or otherwise
attract window shoppers or the curious who are unlikely to buy.

Cost to both: $50 or less per day x 5 days = $250
Investing or Divesting
Five days later, it’s time to tally the results.

What can we consider a “good” click-through and conversion rate’? This is where the math can be
deceiving. If we’re selling a $10,000 abominable snowman suit with an 80% profit margin, we obviously
need a much lower conversion rate than someone who is selling a $50 DVD with a 70% profit margin.

became the central subject of the rest of the week—with most senior staff occupied not so
much by the topic itself, but by how to respond to the president, who was threatening to
“blow” again.

Against this background, almost no one paid attention to the announcement by the
Trump supporter and American neo-Nazi Richard Spencer that he was organizing a protest
at the University of Virginia, in Charlottesville, over the removal of a statue of Robert E.
Lee. “Unite the Right,” the theme of the rally called for Saturday, August 12, was
explicitly designed to link Trump’s politics with white nationalism.

On August 11, with the president in Bedminster continuing to threaten North Korea—
and also, inexplicably to almost everyone on his staff, threatening military intervention in
Venezuela—Spencer called for an evening protest.

At 8:45 p.m.—with the president in for the night in Bedminster—about 250 young men
dressed in khaki pants and polo shirts, quite a Trump style of dress, began an organized
parade across the UVA campus while carrying kerosene torches. Parade monitors with
headsets directed the scene. At a signal, the marchers began chanting official movement
slogans: “Blood and soil!” “You will not replace us!” “Jews will not replace us!” Soon, at
the center of campus, near a statue of UVA’s founder, Thomas Jefferson, Spencer’s group
was met by a counterprotest. With virtually no police presence, the first of the weekend’s
melees and injuries ensued.

Beginning again at eight o’clock the next morning, the park near the Lee statue became
the battleground of a suddenly surging white racist movement, with clubs, shields, mace,
pistols, and automatic rifles (Virginia is an “open carry” state)—a movement seemingly,
and to liberal horror, born out of the Trump campaign and election, as in fact Richard
Spencer intended it to seem. Opposing the demonstrators was a hardened, militant left
called to the barricades. You could hardly have better set an end-times scene, no matter the
limited numbers of protesters. Much of the morning involved a series of charges and
countercharges—a _ rocks-and-bottles combat, with a seemingly hands-off police force
standing by.

In Bedminster, there was still little awareness of the unfolding events in Charlottesville.
But then, at about one o’clock in the afternoon, James Alex Fields Jr., a twenty-year-old
would-be Nazi, plunged his Dodge Charger into a group of counterprotesters, killing
thirty-two-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring a score of others.

In a tweet hurriedly composed by his staff, the president declared: “We ALL must be
united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in
America. Lets come together as one!”

Otherwise, however, it was largely business as usual for the president—Charlottesville
was a mere distraction, and indeed, the staff’s goal was to keep him off North Korea. The

Algorithms

Back in the 1930s no mechanical system could perform a calculation
with any speed. People still used pencil and paper for most things; the
newly-invented mechanical cash registers were slow and could perform
only one calculation for each crank of the handle. If you wanted to
calculate something complex, you had to employ a computer: a person
who could do mental arithmetic enormously fast. Richard Feynman’s
first job was computing for the Manhattan Project. The question was:
Could a computer, either mechanical or human, blindly follow known
rules to decide all mathematical questions? Hilbert’s 10 Problem asked
this question of a particular type of mathematical expression — called a
Diophantine equation.

Hilbert’s 10 Problem

“Given a Diophantine equation with any number of unknown
quantities, devise a finite process to determine whether the
equation is solvable in rational integers.”

David Hilbert

Diophantus lived in ancient Persia — now Iran. His son died young
and Diophantus was so consumed by grief he retreated into mathematics.
He left us seven books of mathematical puzzles — some he devised himself
and some of them taken from antiquity. The puzzles look deceptively
simple and are all based on equations using whole numbers. His most
famous puzzle is set in a poem which tells how old Diophantus was when
he died. Can you solve it?

“Here lies Diophantus,; the wonder behold. Through art algebraic,
the stone tells how old: ‘God gave him his boyhood one-sixth of
his life, One twelfth more as youth while whiskers grew rife; And
then yet one-seventh ere marriage begun; In five years there came
a bouncing new son. Alas, the dear child of master and sage, after
attaining half the measure of his father’s age, life chill fate took him.
After consoling his fate by the science of numbers for four years, he
ended his life.”

Diophantine puzzles look straightforward. Hilbert asked if these

problems could be solved by a mechanical procedure, in modern terms,
by an algorithm. To show you what is meant by this, allow me to take you

consistently be fully formed and ever available, a bracing, unified-field narrative. As well,
he could turn him off, and Bannon would be tactically quiet until turned on again.

Kushner had neither Bannon’s policy imagination nor Priebus’s institutional ties. But,
of course, he had family status, carrying its own high authority. In addition, he had
billionaire status. He had cultivated a wide range of New York and international money
people, Trump acquaintances and cronies, and, often, people whom Trump would have
wished to like him better than they did. In this, Kushner became the representative in the
White House of the liberal status quo. He was something like what used to be called a
Rockefeller Republican and now might more properly be a Goldman Sachs Democrat. He
—and, perhaps even more, Ivanka—was at diametric odds with both Priebus, the stout-
right, Sun Belt-leaning, evangelical dependent Republican, and Bannon, the alt-right,
populist, anti-party disruptor.

From their separate corners each man pursued his own strategy. Bannon did all he
could to roll over Priebus and Kushner in an effort to prosecute the war for
Trumpism/Bannonism as quickly as possible. Priebus, already complaining about
“political neophytes and the boss’s relatives,” subcontracted his agenda out to Ryan and
the Hill. And Kushner, on one of the steepest learning curves in the history of politics (not
that everyone in the White House wasn’t on a steep curve, but Kushner’s was perhaps the
steepest), and often exhibiting a painful naiveté as he aspired to be one of the world’s
savviest players, was advocating doing nothing fast and everything in moderation. Each
had coteries opposed to the other: Bannonites pursued their goal of breaking everything
fast, Priebus’s RNC faction focused on the opportunities for the Republican agenda,
Kushner and his wife did their best to make their unpredictable relative look temperate
and rational.

And in the middle was Trump.

OOK Ok

“The three gentlemen running things,” as Walsh came to coolly characterize them, all
served Trump in different ways. Walsh understood that Bannon provided the president
with inspiration and purpose, while the Priebus-Ryan connection promised to do what to
Trump seemed like the specialized work of government. For his part, Kushner best
coordinated the rich men who spoke to Trump at night, with Kushner often urging them to
caution him against both Bannon and Priebus.

The three advisers were in open conflict by the end of the second week following the
immigration EO and travel ban debacle. This internal rivalry was the result of stylistic,
philosophic, and temperamental differences; perhaps more important, it was the direct
result of the lack of a rational org chart or chain of command. For Walsh, it was a daily
process of managing an impossible task: almost as soon as she received direction from one

“Tm not asking you to.”
Silence. Then a nod, a laugh, and a crooked smile of resignation.
“OK, then—it’s fine.”

And that was that, lickity-split. Forty-four-year old Dave Camarillo, lifelong employee, had cracked
the code and started his second life.

He hadn’t been fired; he hadn’t been yelled at. His boss seemed to be handling the whole situation
quite well. Granted, Dave delivered the goods on the job, and it wasn’t like he was doing naked snow
angels in client meetings, but still—he had just spent 30 days in China without telling anyone.

“It wasn’t half as hard as I thought it would be.”

Dave works among more than 10,000 employees at Hewlett- Packard (HP), and—against all odds—he
actually likes it. He has no desire to start his own company and has spent the last seven years doing tech
support for customers in 45 states and 22 countries. Six months ago, however, he had a small problem.

She measured 5'2” and weighed 110 pounds.

Was he, like most men, afraid of commitment, unwilling to stop running around the house in Spider-
Man underoos, or inseparable from the last refuge of any self-respecting man, the PlayStation? No, he
was past all that. In fact, Dave was locked and loaded, ready to pop the big question, but he was short on
vacation days and his girlfriend lived out of town. Waaaaay out of town—5,913 miles out of town.

He had met her on a client visit to Shenzhen, China, and it was now time to meet the parents, logistics
be damned.

Dave had only recently begun to take tech calls at home, and, well, isn’t home where the heart is? One
plane ticket and one T-Mobile GSM tri-band phone later, he was somewhere over the Pacific en route to
his first seven-day experiment. Twelve time zones hence, he proposed, she accepted, and no one was the
wiser stateside.

advance on Warsaw. The Polish Intelligence Bureau badly needed
to know what the German army was planning and had recruited this
group of young mathematicians as code breakers. Up to this point, code-
breaking had been the domain of linguists able to see word patterns
in apparently random sets of letters. The arrival of electro-mechanical
machines made this method redundant, and code-breaking had become
the domain of mathematical minds. The British, French, and American
intelligence agencies were all hard at work deciphering the German
codes, but only the Polish group, motivated by the imminent threat of
invasion, had made real progress. The code they were breaking: ‘Enigma.
As with many inventions, Enigma got off to a difficult start. The
inventor, Arthur Scherbius, tried to sell it to the army but they rejected it
saying it did not provide any real military benefit. Instead, the machine
went into service transmitting commercial shipping manifests. However,
some senior figures in the German military had not forgotten the lesson
of the First World War. During that war, the German army suffered
major setbacks because the British broke all their codes early on. With
the onset of World War II, Rommel ordered the German Army and Navy
to deploy modern coding machines. The previously rejected Enigma was
rapidly pressed into service and, all of a sudden, Europe went dark to
Allied Intelligence. The man to lead the task of breaking Enigma for the
English was Alan Turing.

Alan Turing

Alan Turing was conceived in India but born in London in early 1912.
He was precocious from an early age and an extraordinarily determined
character. His first day at Public School, Sherborne in Dorset, coincided
with the British General Strike of 1926. With no public transport available,
the thirteen-year-old Turing cycled the 60 miles to school, staying in a
guesthouse on the way and earning a write-up in his local newspaper.
Turing went on to study Mathematics at King’s College, Cambridge and
was made a Fellow at only 22. In 1936 Turing, aged 24, published On
Computable Numbers and their Application to the Entscheidungsproblem,
not a snappy title, but one of the most influential mathematical works of
the 20 century. The paper described the new the science of computing
and solved Hilbert’s “Entscheidungsproblem, a mathematical puzzle

Chinese ruling party.

The Times reported that Broidy drafted a plan to enlist Emirati officials to pressure the U.S.
to turn over Guo. In his statement to the newspaper, Broidy said he “never had a strategy or
plan regarding Mr. Guo nor was there any compensation given or even discussed.”

Broidy’s alleged efforts to push for Guo’s extradition came after Wynn separately helped
deliver a message from the Xi government seeking to have the dissident returned to China,
according to a person familiar with the effort.

Wynn, who has contacts with Chinese officials because of his business interests in Macau,
hand-delivered a letter to Trump seeking Guo’s deportation, The Journal reported last year.
A spokesman for Wynn Resorts has said that the report about Wynn’s role was false.

At the time, the president expressed interest in assisting the Chinese, but was met with
resistance by senior law enforcement officials, according to the person.

White House officials did not respond to requests for comment.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016968.txt,"In the past decade, genetic engineering has caught up with computer science with regard
to how new scientific initiatives are shaping our lives. Genetic engineer George
Church, a pioneer of the revolution in reading and writing biology, is central to this new
landscape of ideas. He thinks of the body as an operating system, with engineers taking
the place of traditional biologists in retooling stripped-down components of organisms
(from atoms to organs) in much the same vein as in the late 1970s, when electrical
engineers were working their way to the first personal computer by assembling circuit
boards, hard drives, monitors, etc. George created and is director of the Personal
Genome Project, which provides the world’s only open-access information on human
genomic, environmental, and trait data (GET) and sparked the growing DNA ancestry
industry.

He was instrumental in laying the groundwork for President Obama’s 2013
BRAIN (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) Initiative—in
aid of improving the brains of human beings to the point where, for much of what
sustains us, we might not need the help of (potentially dicey) Als. “Tt could be that some
of the BRAIN Initiative projects allow us to build human brains that are more consistent
with our ethics and capable of doing advanced tasks like artificial intelligence,” George
has said. “The safest path by far is getting humans to do all the tasks that they would like
to delegate to machines, but we re not yet firmly on that super-safe path.”

More recently, his crucially important pioneering use of the enzyme CRISPR (as
well as methods better than CRISPR) to edit the genes of human cells is sometimes
missed by the media in the telling of the CRISPR origins story.

George's attitude toward future forms of artificial general intelligence is friendly,
as evinced in the essay that follows. At the same time, he never loses sight of the AI-
safety issue. On that subject, he recently remarked: “The main risk in AI, to my mind, is
not so much whether we can mathematically understand what they ’re thinking; it’s
whether we re capable of teaching them ethical behavior. We’re barely capable of
teaching each other ethical behavior.”

home via messenger. It was a book: “Math for idiots.”

So he is not without humor, even though he doesn’t drink or smoke, and hates restaurants.

“Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects,” newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He
was certainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few
moments in his company and you know this to be true.

When I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that
“Andy’—as Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his
strange title is. Because if one thing’s for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what
he’s talking about far more than “Andy” does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other
financiers hang out with him.

And Ghislaine?
Full disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It’s almost impossible not to.

She is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I’ve spent hours
talking to her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is
curious. She has spent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent
me a DVD of the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away almost anyone else’s I can think of—probably even
Rupert Murdochs’. She is very well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill
Clinton with whom she is close friends.

Yet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 4oth birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-
Platero, (known fondly to her close friends as “the Tennis Goddess”) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When
it comes down to things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her vulnerability.
And that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey.

“He saved her,” I remember a close friend of mine telling me. “When her father died, she was a wreck;
inconsolable. And then Jeffrey took her in. She’s never forgotten that—and never will.”

In many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect
replacement for her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his
sexual pecadillos, but then Ghislaine’s father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving
a massive “black hole” he’d fraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey's habits may not have seemed that
strange.

In fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful
people in the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl
issues, and moved countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You
don’t tend to get to the top by being the world’s most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett
didn’t quite manage a normal life—whatever that is. He had a second “wife” for many years whose existence he
has been open about.

So what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven’t spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her
loyalty to friends like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about as always. Look
at Waksal and Stewart. No one sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up for
all sorts of blemishes.

what was happening in the house. It would start off with massaging or we would start off
with foreplay, sometimes it would lead to, you know, orgies.

JS: Were there occasions when you were in Jeffrey’s company, whether on the ground or in
the air, where there were other girls present whom you knew to be under age 18?

V: Yes. There was a constant influx of girls coming in and going out. And we were all very
young. On occasion, there was some older girls, and I don’t mean older as in like in their
30s or anything, I mean like 28, 29, something like that, just very rarely. The majority of
the girls that Jeffrey actually met or had on his plane or in his house were under age.

JS: Do you know how it is that Jeffrey established with any of these underage girls?

V: Yes, Ido. He would send me personally or with other girls to clubs or shops, to _pick up
anywhere, J mean we were constantly on the look for other girls that might satisfy
Jeffrey.

JS: | What instructions were you given about what to look for?

V: Young, pretty, you know, a fun personality. They couldn’t be black. If they were any
other descent other than white, they had to be exotically beautiful. That was just about it.

JS: | Who gave you those criteria?

V: They both gave us the instructions, and it wasn’t just me, Jeffrey asked most girls to bring
a friend and make extra money. They would use us young girls So that way it probably
looked a lot more safer to a girl that we were procuring to younger girls that were already
doing it. That was the way that Jeffrey had it.

JS: Were you given any instruction at all on how to approach these girls?

V: Yes. Jeffrey and Ghislaine both taught me to, depending on the circumstances,
depending on the girl, you could offer them a job as a massage therapist or you could tell
them you have a really rich friend with, you know, great contacts in the acting world or
modeling world and he loves pretty girls, you should come back and meet him, make
some money, you know, we had a whole bunch of ways to be able to procure girls.

JS: Can you give me any idea as to the total number of underage girls that you know engaged
in sexual conduct with Jeffrey during the period of time you had your relationship with
him?

V: I would have no way of estimating that whatsoever. I mean, there could be a hundred,

there could be more, honestly I’m not too sure how many girls, really. I wish I did know.
I mean like I said there were so many over the course of 4 years with Jeffrey.

doesn't have to decline but highlights the problem. “Labor must recognise what it has created,” he says, invoking the
Hawke-Keating era. It has a created a new society and it has to be the party of the new society.

It can't be the party of part of the old society. Labor must be the party of those people who gained from the pro-
market growth economy that we created. Labor must be open to the influences of this middle class, to people on
higher incomes. And | don't think it is.”

It is, perhaps, the clearest statement of Labor's problem. The party, in an act of strategic folly, abandoned the path
of its previous success. It turned inwards on itself, away from the community.

At the operating level it's become the party of insiders, Keating says. The problem is that members get too caught
up in the gift of faction managers and they get caught up in the false construct of popularity, the false god.

Fixated by the nature of political leadership, Keating's book After Words shouts out: The great curse of modern
political life is incrementalism.

Leaning across the table he says to me that briefing notes and economic texts aren't enough: the leader must locate
his own source of higher command and inner belief. He laments the efforts of US President Barak Obama and
German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the teeth of contemporary challenges.

“There is nothing preordained about American decline any more than the European project is destined to fail, he
writes.

But the portents are not good. Despite the rhetoric, President Obama conducts himself as an arbitrator or mediator
between the competing strands of American economic and political ideology. He repeatedly eschews striking out,
snatching the naked flame and hanging on. But the cost of this strategy is not simply a cost to him; it is a cost to the
whole world.

On the other hand, Chancellor Merkel is the archetypal worry-wart. She does not lead; she assesses.

You really wonder why leaders want these jobs when they really do not want to lead. And what is their risk? That
Barack Obama will not get a second term? Or that Angela Merkel's coalition might finally end up on the rocks? If
they actually made the leap they might astound themselves. Because, in the end, everyone in political life gets
carried out - the only relevant question is whether the pallbearers will be crying.

For Keating, the 20th-century leader exerting most influence on the coming century is China's Deng Xiaoping.

If you look at the other figures of the century, Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin and Mao, none will leave the legacy in
terms of the 21st century that Deng leaves,” he says. He walked away from the ideology of the Communist Party

just as effectively as Mikhail Gorbachev walked away from the essence of the Soviet Union.

By 2050 Keating sees a world order with nations in terms of gross domestic product in this hierarchy: (1) China, (2)
US, (3) India, (4) Japan, (5) Brazil, (6) Russia, (7) Britain, (8) Germany, (9) France and (10) Italy.

The key, however, is that Japan lags a distant fourth behind the top three.

On America, Keating is dismayed by the pivotal change in its outlook after the end of the Cold War. “When the
Berlin Wall came down the Americans cried victory and walked off the field,” he says.

Yet the end of the Cold War offered the chance for America to develop a new world order. It didn't know what to do

with its victory. This at the moment the US should have begun exploiting the opportunity of establishing a new world
order to embrace open regionalism and the inclusion of great states like China, India and the then loitering Russia.

rejects the pending motion for joinder (DE 279), then the Court should strike the scurrilous
allegations against Dershowitz, or, alternatively, determine the possible mootness of his Motion
for Limited Intervention. Of course, if the Court strikes the allegations against him sua sponte,
Prof. Dershowitz will withdraw his motion for limited intervention. However, if the Court grants
Jane Does #3 and #4’s motion for joinder, then Prof. Dershowitz’s motion for limited
intervention should be granted for such purposes as may be appropriate including submitting a
motion to strike or other relief, so as to give him an opportunity to defend himself against these
malicious and false allegations. In support of his Reply in Support of his Motion for Limited
Intervention, Prof. Dershowitz states as follows:

Despite swearing under oath to her falsehoods about Prof. Dershowitz, Jane Doe #3
struggles to justify her defamations as having any relevance to the issues in this proceeding. Her
Response to Prof. Dershowitz’s Motion for Limited Intervention (DE 291) (herein “Response”)
offers no legitimate reason for defaming Prof. Dershowitz in her Joinder Motion, and she has no
right to continue to do so in this Court. Strikingly, the Response does not explain why Jane Doe
#3, with an obvious financial motive for fabrication of salacious accusations, waited almost
seven years to lob a stink bomb into a proceeding in which she has no right to participate. The
Response does not account for why Jane Doe #3 never once asserted her accusations about Prof.
Dershowitz until a month ago, even though the alleged transgressions supposedly occurred some
fifteen years ago. Although neither Jane Doe #3 nor anyone else had previously asserted any
improper sexual contact with Prof. Dershowitz, now Jane Doe #3 cynically exploits the yoke of

victimhood to victimize others.

6. Analogical and contextual inferences between self and other, regarding BDI and other as-
pects

7. Attribute causes and meanings to other agents behaviors

8. Anthropomorphize non-human, including inanimate objects

or

The main special requirement placed on an AGI’s embodiment by the above aspects pertains
to the ability of agents to express their emotions and intentions to each other. Humans do this
via facial expressions, gestures and language.

9.5.1 Motivation, Requiredness, Value

Relatedly to folk psychology, Gestalt [Koh38] and ecological [Gib77, Gib79] psychology suggest
that humans perceive the world substantially in terms of the affordances it provides them for
goal-directed action. This suggests that, to support human-like intelligence, an AGI must be
capable of:

1. Perception of entities in the world as differentially associated with goal-relevant value
2. Perception of entities in the world in terms of the potential actions they afford the agent,
or other agents

The key point is that entities in the world need to provide a wide variety of ways for agents
to interact with them, enabling richly complex perception of affordances.

9.6 Body and Mind

The above discussion has focused on the world external to the body of the AGI agent embodied
and embedded in the world, but the issue of the AGI’s body also merits consideration. There
seems little doubt that a human’s intelligence is highly conditioned by the particularities of the
human body.

9.6.1 The Human Sensorium

Here the requirements seem fairly simple: while surely not strictly necessary, it would certainly
be preferable to provide an AGI with fairly rich analogues of the human senses of touch, sight,
sound, kinesthesia, taste and smell. Each of these senses provides different sorts of cognitive
stimulation to the human mind; and while similar cognitive stimulation could doubtless be
achieved without analogous senses, the provision of such seems the most straightforward ap-
proach. It’s hard to know how much of human intelligence is specifically biased to the sorts of
outputs provided by human senses.

As vision already is accorded such a prominent role in the AI and cognitive science literature
— and is discussed in moderate depth in Chapter 26 of Part 2, we won’t take time elaborating

A Mind-World Correspondence Principle

10.1 Introduction

Real-world minds are always adapted to certain classes of environments and goals. The ideas
of the previous chapter, regarding the connection between a human-like intelligence’s internals
and its environment, result from exploring the implications of this adaptation in the context
of the cognitive synergy concept. In this chapter we explore the mind-world connection in a
broader and more abstract way — making a more ambitious attempt to move toward a general
theory of general intelligence.

One basic premise here, as in the preceding chapters is: Even a system of vast general
intelligence, subject to real-world space and time constraints, will necessarily be more efficient
at some kinds of learning than others. Thus, one approach to formulating a general theory of
general intelligence is to look at the relationship between minds and worlds — where a world
is conceived as an environment and a set of goals defined in terms of that environment.

In this spirit, we here formulate a broad principle binding together worlds and the minds that
are intelligent in these worlds. The ideas of the previous chapter constitute specific, concrete
instantiations of this general principle. A careful statement of the principle requires introduction
of a number of technical concepts, and will be given later on in the chapter. A crude, informal
version of the principle would be:

MIND-WORLD CORRESPONDENCE-PRINCIPLE

For a mind to work intelligently toward certain goals in a certain world, there should be a
nice mapping from goal-directed sequences of world-states into sequences of mind-states, where
nice means that a world-state-sequence W composed of two parts W, and Wo, gets mapped
into a mind-state-sequence M composed of two corresponding parts M, and Mo.

What’s nice about this principle is that it relates the decomposition of the world into parts,
to the decomposition of the mind into parts.

elaborate on that in a moment, but yeah, one of -- so
this was another point. I mentioned that there had been
three efforts to get information from Mr. Dershowitz by
way of a 2009 deposition request, a 2011 deposition
request, and further follow-up correspondence from
counsel on that, and a 2013 document request all

my mind at the time -- but when we saw Mr. Dershowitz
not responding to these answers, you know, maybe the
mail didn't get delivered to him or something like that.
I suppose that's, you know, a theoretical possibility.

But the reason I ruled out that possibility,
first, it didn't seem likely; but secondly, there was a
pattern of Mr. Epstein's associates evading efforts to
get information from them. And so let me just go back
to the earliest instance of that.

According to the Chief of Police in the Palm
Beach -- of the Palm Beach Police Department,
Mr. Dershowitz had said that he would make available
Mr. Epstein for questions about the sex, you know, abuse
that was going on. And, you know, Mr. Dershowitz had
said to the Palm Beach Police Department, yeah, we will
make him available, no, we got to reschedule it, you

It is hard to find a more hyperbolic intersection of media and lawyers then in
Epstein’s case.

Edwards, over the six years of his law suit, tries to depose Clinton, Donald
Trump, and Dershowitz—almost all of his targets coming directly from the
original Vanity Fair and New York Magazine articles about Epstein.

In addition to Prince Andrew as a British hot button, first connected to
Epstein through Roberts’ interview with the Daily Mail in 2010, Clinton takes on a
new role as Hillary spoiler through his connection, real or imagined, to Epstein and
sex Slaves.

Almost everybody identified in any story about Epstein is approached by
other media seeking to write about Epstein, often with financial incentives offered
in exchange for a tale.

No new stories or even new details emerge. Every aspect of the current story
is based on court filings describing events that may or may not have taken place
prior to 2007. It’s as though a kind of ground-hog day of moral opprobrium, a
desire to repeat and to savor a new the old details.

A recent Reuters story identified a charity that Epstein has not given money
to in 15 years that said if he does give again, they would give it back.

The world cleanly divides, with Epstein (and friends) behind secure walls
and the Mail and social media and upholders of new norms ever more incredulous
and apoplectic that Epstein not only appears free but prospers too. Although he
has spent more than a year in jail and paid out what may be as much as $20
million, he yet seems somehow to have not been sufficiently punished—that worst
sin of all. He is the unrepentant catch all of up-to-the-minute badness: the financier
whose wealth is a product of Wall Street math rather than hard work; a rich
middle-age white man who not only parades his wealth and entitlement, but has a
Peter Pan complex to boot; an insistent Playboy in a correct and prudish
world—someone who somehow didn’t get the memo about vast changes in mores
and culture.

When I suggested recently that one obvious way to blunt the animus would
be to get married, he said he’d rather go back to jail.

He is Calvin Harris’s song, It Was Acceptable in the 80s, come to life.

This is all, of course, a Gatsby-like tale: An enigmatic, and strangely
appealing figure, able to invent and inhabit his own world is a mystery to try to
decipher. Of course Gatsby in New York Post and Daily Mail parlance would
likely be just a freaky financier too.

And this story is, in its way, about the limitation of journalism, in which the
most compelling parts of the tale—Epstein’s ambitions and impulses would be

Neuroimaging. Finally, neuroimaging technology has enabled many of these breakthroughs. As such, it is
itself a methodological breakthrough that has enabled these other content breakthroughs. Neuroimaging now
enables detailed location of the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of REM and NREM Sleep. In

REM Sleep, the dorsolateral, frontal cortex is “down-regulated”, whereas the limbic system is “up-regulated”,
showing the physiological basis for the emotional, wild-fantasies of dreams (see above). (Neuroimaging will

Patrick stresses that while these breakthroughs form, for the first time, a solid foundation for understanding
sleep and dreams, they also open opportunities to dig deeper into the “purpose” of sleep and dreams, as well
as engender a new series of questions and directions (e.g., clinical treatments of illnesses).

execution. You might ask what runs the operating system and that is a
smaller program called the BIOS. What runs BIOS? An even smaller
program called the Bootstrap. Once all this is up and running you have a
working computer, which can run any program you throw at it.

The problem with programs is they tend to crash — usually at
the most inconvenient times. It is often not clear whether a program
has truly crashed. It might be stuck in an infinite loop, or it could be
calculating the answer to a complex question, such as the answer to life,
the Universe, and everything. How would we know? If only I had waited
a little longer before rebooting, the program would have run to its end
and given me the answer to Douglas Adams’ question.

It would be very useful, and save a great deal of time, if I had a way
of telling whether a program will ever stop. An elegant solution would be
to have a second program called “Halt, which would test the program and
output ‘will halt’ or ‘will crash’ as appropriate. It turns out this program
would be more than just useful. It could be used as an oracle, capable of
answering almost any question imaginable.

I could, for example, write a program that says: for every index in
Fermat’s puzzle try every number and halt if you find a solution greater
than 2. Now if I run my halt program on this program and it states ‘will
crash; I will have solved Fermat’s Last Theorem! Do you see why?

If we give ‘Halt’ an input: a program we are interested in, along with
some data, it will tell us if the program finds an answer. If I am trying to
solve Fermat’s Last Theorem, we will ask it to try every possible index for
the equation 3*+4*=5* and halt when it finds a true result greater than 2.
If the halt program says yes and halts, you can trace through the program
and work out how it did it. The theory would be proved. If the program
says no, the theory is disproved. This gives us a way to discover proofs of
many mathematical theorems.

I could try almost any puzzle using a program with this form. All I
need do is put a problem in the following decision format: try all possible
options, and then stop and ring a bell if a solution is found. The Halt
program would then give the result leading to untold riches, winning all
the remaining Clay Mathematics prizes at the very least and earning me
$6m.

Does such a magical program exist? The answer, sadly, is no. There
is no Halt program and the final part of Turing’s paper proved there can
never be.

to admit their paucity, or he had hidden them to mask their disreputableness.) Because
Trump is less than creditworthy, Foer was among many who concluded that Trump needed
to turn to other sources—more or less dirty money, or money with other sorts of strings
attached. (One way the process can work is, roughly speaking, as follows: an oligarch
makes an investment in a more or less legitimate third-party investment fund, which, quid
pro quo, makes an investment in Trump.) And while Trump would categorically deny that
he had any loans or investments from Russia, one would, of course, not have dirty money
on one’s books.

As a subset of this theory, Trump—never very scrupulous about vetting his people—
surrounded himself with a variety of hustlers working their own deals, and, plausibly,
aiding Trump’s deals. Foer identified the following characters as part of a possible Russian
conspiracy:

¢ Tevfik Arif, a former Rus sian official who ran the Bayrock Group, a middleman in
Trump financings with an office in Trump Tower.

¢ Felix Sater (sometimes spelled Satter), a Russian-born immigrant to Brighton Beach
in Brooklyn, who had previously served time in prison in connection with a fraud at
a Mafia-run brokerage and who went to work for Bayrock and had a business card
identifying him as senior adviser to Donald Trump. (When Sater’s name later
continued to surface, Trump assured Bannon he didn’t know Sater at all.)

* Carter Page, a banker of uncertain portfolio who had spent time in Russia and billed
himself as having advised the state-run oil company, Gazprom, and who showed up
on a hastily assembled list of Trump foreign policy advisers and who, it would turn
out, the FBI was closely monitoring in what it said was a Russian intelligence effort
to turn him. (Trump would later deny ever meeting Page, and the FBI would say that
it believed Russian intelligence had targeted Page in an effort to turn him.)

¢ Michael Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency—fired by
Obama for unclear reasons—who had yet to emerge as Trump’s key foreign policy
counselor and future National Security Advisor, but who was accompanying him on
many campaign trips and who earlier in the year had been paid a $45,000 speaking
fee in Moscow and been photographed sitting at a dinner with Putin.

¢ Paul Manafort, whom, along with serving as Trump’s campaign manager, Foer
highlighted as a political operative and consultant who had generated substantial
income advising Kremlin-backed Viktor Yanukovych, who successfully ran for the
presidency of Ukraine in 2010, was later deposed in 2014, and had been in business
with the Russian oligarch and Putin crony Oleg Deripaska.

More than a year later, each of these men would be part of the near-daily Russia-Trump
news cycle.

The Handler

As for [Snowden’s] communication with the outside world, yes, I
am his main contact.

—ANATOLY KUCHERENA, Moscow, 2013

N NOVEMBER 1, I still had not been able to make contact with
Anatoly Kucherena, and my flight back to New York was in five
days. My fixer, Zamir, had been trying to arrange an appointment
for three weeks, but he had only received one callback from Kucher-
ena’s assistant, Valentina Kvirvova. She wanted to know how I knew
Oliver Stone. Zamir told her of my part in Stone’s movie. That was
the last he had heard from her. Meanwhile, a Moscow-based journal-
ist told me that she had waited eighteen months to hear back from
Kucherena before giving up. I also learned from a Russian researcher
that Kucherena had not given a single interview since his television
interview with Sophie Shevardnadze on September 23, 2013. And
no Russian journalist, or ary Moscow-based foreign journalist, had
ever obtained an interview with Snowden. At this point, Zamir was
becoming increasingly doubtful about my getting access to either
Kucherena or Snowden.
I turned to another contact in Moscow. When I had been inves-
tigating the 2006 polonium poisoning of the former KGB officer

of court hearings and to attend those hearings.'*’ So it is instructive to
notice that the Justice Department policy is to extend certain rights to
suspected criminals during certain points in the investigative process. That
policy might provide guidance on when crime victims’ rights would attach.

Of particular interest here is the Department’s policy for grand jury
subpoenas issued to a “target” of a criminal investigation. When such a
target is subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury, the Department of
Justice will advise that target of his rights, such as the right to refuse to
answer any question that might be incriminating.'*® The Department of
Justice defines a “target” of a criminal investigation as “a person as to
whom the prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial evidence linking him
or her to the commission of a crime and who, in the judgment of the
prosecutor, is a putative defendant.”!*”

If the Department’s investigation has coalesced sufficiently so that it
can provide notice of rights to putative defendants, it should likewise be in
a position to provide notice of rights to that defendant’s victims.
Combining the Department’s definition of “target” with the CVRA’s
coverage and definition-of-victim provisions produces a formulation
whereby CVRA rights attach in (at least) the following circumstances:

CVRA rights attach when an officer or employee of the Department of
Justice or any other department or agency of the United States engaged in
the detection, investigation, or prosecution of crime has substantial
evidence that an identifiable person has been directly and proximately
harmed as a result of the commission of a federal offense or an offense in
the District of Columbia, and in the judgment of the officer or employee,
that person is a putative victim of that offense.

This formulation borrows from the CVRA’s coverage provision!”° to
define the relevant universe of substantial evidence as that in the possession
of the Justice Department or other federal agencies. For instance, if state
law enforcement officers are investigating a bank robbery, the fact that the
robbery might also be prosecuted federally'*! does not make the teller at the
bank a federal “victim” of the crime until evidence regarding the crime
comes into the possession of a federal agency. The formulation also tracks
the CVRA’s definition of “victim” in limiting the universe of potential

state victims’ rights statutes).

done. Take whatever you need, from wherever you want. Bring me suggestions
by seven tomorrow morning.” Then, he said, we would go brief the Defense
Minister, Shimon Peres.

I assembled a team the same way we’d prepared for special-operations
missions in the sayeret: looking for information, intelligence and above all
experience and insight from whoever I thought was likely to make that always-
narrow difference between failure and success. My first calls went to Mookie
Betzer and another of my most trusted and experienced sayeret comrades,
Amiram Levin. Then I brought in Ido Ambar, the personal aide to air force
commander Benny Peled, and Gadi Shefi, the commander of the Shayetet 13
SEALs. Finally, two officers from Dan Shomron’s office. Since Dan was
katzhar, in overall command of paratroop and infantry forces, it was critical to
keep him in the picture. I told them all that we’d be working through the night,
and that I had to be able to tell Motta and Shimon by the morning whether we
really could mount a rescue mission.

I still thought Pd end up having to tell them no. However difficult the
obstacles we’d faced with Sabena, they were almost child’s play compared to
getting a sayeret assault team 5,000 miles across the continent of Africa,
surprising the terrorists, freeing the hostages unharmed and getting them out.
That was even assuming, as I did at that point, that we wouldn’t face armed
opposition from the troops of Uganda’s increasingly tyrannical president, Idi
Amin. Amin had begun to align himself politically with the Palestinians in the
past few years — one reason, no doubt, the terrorists had landed there. But he
had actually been on a paratroop course in Israel before taking power in 1971.
We had sent officers to help train his army in the early 1970s.

Now, I discovered, Mookie himself had been on one of the training missions.
“Their men aren’t great fighters, at least at night,” he said, an insight of obvious
relevance to planning a commando attack, if we could get that far. When
Ambar, the air force aide, spoke up, I finally began to feel we might at least be
able to put together the outline of a plan. He’d brought with him a copy of the
standard reference book on world airports, which gave us at least a general idea
of the layout of Entebbe. He also said that the air force had run a training
program for the Ugandans. In Entebbe. He’d contacted one of the reserve pilots
who had been on the training mission, and he was on his way to join us.

Still, time was short we were nowhere near being able to recommend a
specific plan of action. The hijackers had set a deadline — noon on Thursday,

for them to stock the machine, employ someone to tell you about it, and
fix it if it goes wrong in the first year. Value for money improvements
have all focused on faster processors, more memory, sharper displays
and larger hard drives, not lower prices. These improvements are useful if
you want to shoot aliens, but overkill if you only want to surf the Internet
and learn the ‘3 Rs. So the ‘One Laptop per Child’ project has developed
a device for $100.

Negroponte is often asked how he deals with the maintenance and
repair issues. His answer, “There aren't any.’ The computers are treasured
possessions and rarely broken or lost. Children become empowered by
the machines and can access knowledge and information far beyond the
wildest dreams of their parents’ generation. Stories abound of children
checking the spot prices for wheat or coffee on the Chicago Stock
Exchange, and advising their parents on the price to accept for their
crop. Negroponte estimates there are currently 500,000 children in South
America teaching their parents to read!

It’s interesting to speculate whether children learn spontaneously or
are somehow ‘programmed’ by the adult members of society. In both the
‘Hole in the Wall’ experiment and the ‘One Laptop per Child’ program
the children could simply be learning from adults and older children, but
there is a novel way to eliminate this influence. Negroponte and Mitra
have teamed up to run an experiment to see how children learn for
themselves. They are planning to air-drop laptops into remote villages
in the Andes. In this scenario, the children can't possibly learn from the

http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey-epstein-200303

“T think we both possess the skill of seeing patterns,” says Wexner. “But Jeffrey sees patterns in
politics and financial markets, and I see patterns in lifestyle and fashion trends. My skills are not
in investment strategy, and, as everyone who knows Jeffrey knows, his are not in fashion and
design. We frequently discuss world trends as each of us sees them.”

By the time Epstein met Wexner, the latter was a retail legend who had built a $3 billion
empire—one that now includes Victoria’s Secret, Express, and Bath & Body Works—from
$5,000 lent him by his aunt. “Wexner saw in Jeffrey the type of person who had the potential to
realize his [Jeffrey’s] dreams,” says someone who has worked closely with both men. “He gave
Jeffrey the ball, and Jeffrey hit it out of the park.”

Wexner, through a trust, bought the town house in which Epstein now lives for a reported $13.2
million in 1989. In 1993, Wexner married Abigail Koppel, a 31-year-old lawyer, and the
newlyweds relocated to Ohio; in 1996, Epstein moved into the town house. Public documents
suggest that the house is still owned by the trust that bought it, but Epstein has said that he now
owns the house.

Wexner trusts Epstein so completely that he has assigned him the power of fiduciary over all of
his private trusts and foundations, says a source close to Wexner. In 1992, Epstein even
persuaded Wexner to put him on the board of the Wexner Foundation in place of Wexner’s ailing
mother. Bella Wexner recovered and demanded to be reinstated. Epstein has said they settled by
splitting the foundation in two.

Epstein does not care that he comes between family members. In fact, he sees it as his job. He
tells people, “I am there to represent my client, and if my client needs protecting—sometimes
even from his own family—then it’s often better that people hate me, not the client.”

“You’ve probably heard I’m vicious in my representation of my clients,” he tells people proudly;
Leah Kleman describes his haggling over art prices as something like a scene out of the movie
Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome. Even a former mentor says he’s seen “the dark side” of
Epstein, and a Bear Stearns source recalls a meeting in which Epstein chewed out a team making
a presentation for Wexner as being so brutal as to be “irresponsible.”

One reporter, in fact, received three threats from Epstein while preparing a piece. They were
delivered in a jocular tone, but the message was clear: There will be trouble for your family if I
don’t like the article.

On the other hand, Epstein is clearly very generous with friends. Joe Pagano, an Aspen-based
venture capitalist, who has known Epstein since before his Bear Stearns days, can’t say enough
nice things: “I have a boy who’s dyslexic, and Jeffrey’s gotten close to him over the years....
Jeffrey got him into music. He bought him his first piano. And then as he got to school he had
difficulty ... in studying ... so Jeffrey got him interested in taking flying lessons.”

Rosa Monckton recalls Epstein telling her that her daughter, Domenica, who suffers from Down

syndrome, needed the sun, and that Rosa should feel free to bring her to his house in Palm Beach
anytime.

My colleague insisted that the young man had a moral obligation to his fiancé and a legal
obligation to the police to be truthful.

At first, the young man refused, but my colleague, after conferring with me, told him he really had
no choice, because she would be obligated to report his continuing crime of making a false
report—a crime that endangered the life and liberty of anyone fitting the made-up description of
the black man with the shark’s tooth. (The young man didn’t want to get the man with whom he
had consensual sex in trouble, so he invoked the stereotype of the “black man” rapist.) My
colleague told him that she would try to make a deal with the police under which he wouldn’t be
charged with a crime in exchange for telling the truth.

The young man then told the police and his fiancé the truth. The police called off the all points
bulletin, and my colleague persuaded the police not to press charges against the young man. I do
not know how the engagement worked out, but I do know that I learned a great deal from this
experience about the complexities of sexual encounters and the need to subject claims of rape to
the usual probing of the adversarial process.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu

Among the public figures I have counseled is Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. I had
met Bibi when he was a student in Cambridge in the early 1970’s. We got to know each other
when he served in New York as Israel’s representative to the United Nations. He has been to our
home for dinner and we have been at his. Over the years, he has sought my advice on legal and
governmental matters, but not on Israeli domestic politics, which he knows I stay out of.

Shortly after he first became Prime Minister, he invited me to his office on a Friday afternoon.

My wife, our daughter and I stood outside of the King David Hotel trying to hail a cab, but all the
cab drivers were heading home for the weekend. It looked like we might be late for our
appointment with the Prime Minister. Suddenly a car pulled up. It was the mayor of Jerusalem,
Ehud Olmert, whom I knew. He rolled down his window and shouted, “Alan, you’ll never get a
cab on a Friday afternoon. Where do you need to go?” I told him and he willingly agreed to
drive us there. As I began to get into his car, a cab driver pulled over and said, “I'll take them.”
Olmert replied, “No, no, it’Il be my pleasure.” The cab driver pulled his car in front of Olmert’s,
blocking it and shouting, “I don’t try to run Jerusalem, why are you trying to be a cab driver?
Stop taking business from me.” Only in Jerusalem! I paid the cab driver what his fare would’ve
been and took the ride with the mayor.

When I got to the Prime Minister’s office, Bibi spent a few minutes with us and then invited me to
his private office for a confidential meeting. He explained that this was one of the most secure
locations in the world and that anything I told him would never leave the room. He then said,
“There’s been something I have been waiting to ask you.” I expected him to ask my advice on
some critical security or political issue, as he had in the past. I said, “Sure, ask me anything.” He
put his arm around me and whispered in my ear, “So, did O.J. do it?” I was taken aback but I
quickly responded, “So, Mr. Prime Minister, does Israel have nuclear weapons?” Bibi looked at
me sternly and said, “You know I can’t answer that question.” I looked back at him and said,
“Aha!” Bibi understood and we both laughed.

Over the years I have advised Netanyahu on a variety of issues during his tenure as Prime Minister
and between his terms. I do not share all of his political and diplomatic views, and he knows that,
but he seems to value my judgment, as do several other Israeli political leaders to the left of him.
They know I care deeply about Israel and will always give them my unbiased views.

Recently, Netanyahu made the following statement during a nationally-televised conference in
Israel:

“First off, I would like to congratulate the Globes Conference for its foresight in inviting
Alan Dershowitz and I would like to say to Alan. Israel has no greater champion and the
truth has no greater defender than Alan Dershowitz.”

I was obviously flattered by his comment. Several hours later, I received a call from President

Obama, who had apparently learned of Netanyahu’s words. He said he valued my views because
“you've always been straight with me over the years that we’ve known each other.” He asked me

Palestinians; and 20,000 Islamists killed in 1982 by the elder al-
Assad in Hama. The World Health Organization’s estimate of Osama
bin Laden’s carnage in Iraq was already 150,000 a few years earlier.
In a 2007 research, Gunnar Heinsohn from the University of Bremen
and Daniel Pipes, director of the Middle East Forum, found out that
some 11 million Muslims have been violently killed since 1948, of
which 35,000, (0.3 percent) died during the six years of Arab war
against Israel, or one out of every 315 fatalities. In contrast, over 90
percent who perished were killed by fellow Muslims. According to
Mssrs. Heinsohn and Pipes, the grisly inventory finds the total
number of deaths in conflicts all over the world since 1950
numbering around 85 million. Of that, the Muslim Arab deaths in the
Arab-Israeli conflict were at 46,000 including 11,000 during Israel’s
war of independence. That makes 0.05 percent of all deaths in all
conflicts, or 0.4 percent of all Arab deaths in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
In another calculation ignoring “small” massacres like the one that
goes on in Syria and other deaths during the Arab Spring, only
Saddam’s Iraq, Jordan, the elder al-Assad’s Syria, Iran-Iraq war, the
bin Laden campaign in Iraq, the Iranian Islamic revolution and the
Turkish-Kurdish conflict caused 1.65 million Muslim deaths by
Muslims compared to less than 50,000 deaths in the Arab-Israeli
conflict since 1950, including fatalities during and after Operation
Cast Lead which came after the Heinsohn-Pipes study. For those who
don’t have a calculator ready at their desks, allow me to tell: 50,000
is three percent of 1.65 million. Golda Meir, the fourth prime
minister of Israel, or rather the “Mother of Israel,” had a perfectly
realistic point when she said that peace in the Middle East would
only be possible “when Arabs love their children more than they hate

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024223.txt,"Global Utility White Paper CONFIDENTIAL

o Capitalizing on Structural Change Timing

Although some of the structural changes discussed earlier happen in days or weeks, e.g. fuel cost
passthrough adjustments, others will take years to implement, for example, new capacity payment
structures. Because of the sector’s high earnings visibility, however, we do not have to wait until a
particular structural change occurs for a thesis to play out. Utilities often have earnings visibility 2-3
years out (including Street estimates) which is in contrast to other sectors (e.g. tech) which often
times do not have 2-3 quarters of visibility. As such, utility stock prices (and the Street’s estimates)
will begin to discount even some of the longer dated structural changes as clarity surfaces in the early
stages. Therefore, there is a distinct competitive advantage for those who have an early
understanding of such structural changes and the resulting earnings impact on affected utilities. We
therefore focus our efforts on discerning the structural change opportunity early in an effort to come
up with a view before it becomes obvious to the broader market.

Moreover, there are often several opportunities over an extended time period to trade the same
structural change as numerous stakeholders (e.g. government, regulator, company, customers, et al.)
involved in the process distort market perceptions of the final outcome.

Although structural changes are the “home run” opportunities, Electron returns are not limited to
such changes, as we also consistently play for “singles and doubles” in the global utility sector with
earning releases, regulatory reviews, dividend increases and decreases, relative value, regulatory
arbitrage, etc.

As evidence of Electron’s ability to successfully trade both shorter- and longer-term structural
changes, please note our sweet spot for generating returns over the 7-year track record has tended
to be 45-90 days.

e Portfolio Construction

Typically, the portfolio has 70-100 positions, but concentration is very important to generating returns.
Historically, the top 10 longs represent 40-50% of the Fund’s value, and top 10 shorts represent 30-40% of
the fund’s value. Typically we will have a 10% position in the portfolio; this is invariably a liquid, big-cap
utility name with limited downside and a good degree of upside which is expected to be favorably
affected by a key, underappreciated structural change.

The stronger the conviction (from a risk/reward point of view) in the alpha opportunity, the higher the
gross we run. This flexibility in portfolio construction (which we successfully proved over 3 years during
the first iteration of Electron) provides a distinct advantage given the utility sector’s many low-beta, low-
volatility stocks. During the original Electron Capital period, gross ranged from 150% to 215% and a
median of 185% over the period. We see maintaining a similar operating range for gross for the re-launch
for Electron.

Regarding nets, we will always have a properly hedged product as there are always opportunities on the
short side to generate alpha. Over our 7-year track record period, the net averaged 22% net long. During

the first 3 years of Electron, our net averaged 30% long. Given our bearish view on utilities over the last 4
years, the net averaged 17% net long.

e Risk Model and Risk Management

We view utilities as distinct bundles of risk. Just as we are staunch supporters of sum-of-the-parts (SOTP)
valuation, we are also believers in SOTP risk monitoring. As such, our risk model developed over the last

1-grams, such as the phrases “stock market” (a 2-gram) and
“the United States of America” (a 5-gram). We restricted n to
5, and limited our study to n-grams occurring at least 40 times
in the corpus.

Usage frequency is computed by dividing the number of
instances of the n-gram in a given year by the total number of
words in the corpus in that year. For instance, in 1861, the 1-
gram “slavery” appeared in the corpus 21,460 times, on
11,687 pages of 1,208 books. The corpus contains
386,434,758 words from 1861; thus the frequency is 5.5x10°.
“slavery” peaked during the civil war (early 1860s) and then
again during the civil rights movement (1955-1968) (Fig. 1B)

In contrast, we compare the frequency of “the Great War”
to the frequencies of “World War I” and “World War II.” “the
Great War” peaks between 1915 and 1941. But although its
frequency drops thereafter, interest in the underlying events
had not disappeared; instead, they are referred to as “World
War I” (Fig. 1C).

These examples highlight two central factors that
contribute to culturomic trends. Cultural change guides the
concepts we discuss (such as “slavery”). Linguistic change —
which, of course, has cultural roots — affects the words we use
for those concepts (“the Great War” vs. “World War I’). In
this paper, we will examine both linguistic changes, such as
changes in the lexicon and grammar; and cultural phenomena,
such as how we remember people and events.

The full dataset, which comprises over two billion
culturomic trajectories, is available for download or
exploration at www.culturomics.org.

The Size of the English Lexicon
How many words are in the English language (9)?

We call a 1-gram “common” if its frequency is greater
than one per billion. (This corresponds to the frequency of the
words listed in leading dictionaries (7).) We compiled a list of
all common 1-grams m 1900, 1950, and 2000 based on the
frequency of each 1-gram in the preceding decade. These lists
contained 1,117,997 common 1-grams in 1900, 1,102,920 in
1950, and 1,489,337 in 2000.

Not all common 1-grams are English words. Many fell
into three non-word categories: (i) 1-grams with non-
alphabetic characters (“‘18r’, “3.14159”; (i) misspellings
(“becuase, “abberation”); and (411) foreign words
(“sensitivo”).

To estimate the number of English words, we manually
annotated random samples from the lists of common 1-grams
(7) and determined what fraction were members of the above
non-word categories. The result ranged from 51% of all
common 1|-grams in 1900 to 31% in 2000.

Using this technique, we estimated the number of words in
the English lexicon as 544,000 in 1900, 597,000 in 1950, and
1,022,000 in 2000. The lexicon is enjoying a period of

enormous growth: the addition of ~8500 words/year has
increased the size of the language by over 70% during the last
fifty years (Fig. 2A).

Notably, we found more words than appear in any
dictionary. For instance, the 2002 Webster’s Third New
International Dictionary [W3], which keeps track of the
contemporary American lexicon, lists approximately 348,000
single-word wordforms (/0); the American Heritage
Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition (AHD4)
lists 116,161 (7/7). (Both contain additional multi-word
entries.) Part of this gap is because dictionaries often exclude
proper nouns and compound words (“whalewatching”). Even
accounting for these factors, we found many undocumented
words, such as “aridification” (the process by which a
geographic region becomes dry), “slenthem” (a musical
instrument), and, appropriately, the word “deletable.”

This gap between dictionaries and the lexicon results from
a balance that every dictionary must strike: it must be
comprehensive enough to be a useful reference, but concise
enough to be printed, shipped, and used. As such, many
infrequent words are omitted. To gauge how well dictionaries
reflect the lexicon, we ordered our year 2000 lexicon by
frequency, divided it into eight deciles (ranging from 10° —
10° to 10° — 10°), and sampled each decile (7). We manually
checked how many sample words were listed in the OED (12)
and in the Merriam-Webster Unabridged Dictionary [MWD].
(We excluded proper nouns, since neither OED nor MWD
lists them.) Both dictionaries had excellent coverage of high
frequency words, but less coverage for frequencies below 10°
°: 67% of words in the 10° — 10° range were listed in neither
dictionary (Fig. 2B). Consistent with Zipf’s famous law, a
large fraction of the words in our lexicon (63%) were in this
lowest frequency bin. As a result, we estimated that 52% of
the English lexicon — the majority of the words used in
English books — consists of lexical “dark matter”
undocumented in standard references (/2).

To keep up with the lexicon, dictionaries are updated
regularly (/3). We examined how well these changes
corresponded with changes in actual usage by studying the
2077 1-gram headwords added to AHD4 in 2000. The overall
frequency of these words, such as “buckyball” and
“netiquette”, has soared since 1950: two-thirds exhibited
recent, sharp increases in frequency (>2X from 1950-2000)
(Fig. 2C). Nevertheless, there was a lag between
lexicographers and the lexicon. Over half the words added to
AHD4 were part of the English lexicon a century ago
(frequency >10° from 1890-1900). In fact, some newly-
added words, such as “gypseous” and “amplidyne”, have
already undergone a steep decline in frequency (Fig. 2D).

Not only must lexicographers avoid adding words that
have fallen out of fashion, they must also weed obsolete
words from earlier editions. This is an imperfect process. We

purpose high schools. Nobel operates 150 schools in 13 states across the U.S. As of December 31,
2005, the company reported LTM sales and EBITDA of $166 million and $15 million, respectively.
Affiliates of the Principals are currenily significant shareholders of the company.

8.3.4 Government's Role in Early Childhood Education

Approximately 83% of the estimated 554 billion spent on ECE is generated by private and independent
non-profit services. The government provides the remaining 17% of services through Head Start and
public schools. The government pays for public school and Head Start programs, but also subsidizes
payments of low-income families to providers of their choice through the Child Care Development Block
Grant and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which are blended with state dollars. About 25% of
for-profit early childhood care revenue comes from these subsidy programs.

The government is, at both the federal and state level, actively involved in expanding the availability of
early childhood care services. Federal support is delivered at the state level through government-
operated educational and financial assistance programs. Early childhood care services offered directly by
states include training, licensing and regulation for early childhood care providers and resource and
referral systems for parents seeking ECE.

The increasing importance of education is further demonstrated by the “No Child Left Behind Act of
2001, signed into law in January 2002. This Act is the most sweeping reform of the Elementary and
Secondary Education Act, or ESEA, since ESEA was enacted in 1965. To support this commitment,
President Bush requested a $54.4 billion budget for the Department of Education for fiscal 2007, a 28.9%
increase from the 2001 budget of $42.2 billion.

Certain tax incentives exist for early childhood care programs. Section 21 of the Internal Revenue Code
provides federal Income tax credits ranging from 20% to 35% of certain early childhood care expenses for
qualified individuals.

8.4, The U.S, K-12 Education Market

A fundamental change has occurred in the K-12 sector in recent years, as the desire to improve school
quality has overtaken demographics as a key growth driver. Companies providing supplemental
educational services (e.g., KLC) and several school alternatives, such as charter and contract schools
(e.g., k12), are expected to be instrumental in improving K-12 student performance.

The K-12 education market in the U.S. is comprised of over 15,000 school districts including mere than
90,000 K-12 public schools, approximately 3.5 million teachers, and about 54 million students according
to the National Center for Education Statistics. Total K-12 expenditures, federal, state and local, are
approximately $500 billion.

Despite the growth in spending on public education over the last decade, student achievement has shown
littie progress. According to the 2005 National Assessment of Educational Progress, 32% of eighth-
graders performed below the Basic level in mathematics, and only 29% performed at or above the
Proficient level. One-third of American fourth graders are functionally illiterate. KUE believes the

PS - The foundation site was just hacked and I'm in the process of fixing that today. You can actually see it in 
the screenshot above (it reads Cash Advance advertisement in the short-description). This is something a 
previous company deployed but we are now going through and securing the rest of the domains to prevent 
basic hijacks like this. 
I'm free on my cell for next few hours.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013078.txt,"162 9 General Intelligence in the Everyday Human World

9.2 Some Broad Properties of the Everyday World That Help
Structure Intelligence

The properties of the everyday world that help structure intelligence are diverse and span
multiple levels of abstraction. Most of this chapter will focus on fairly concrete patterns of this
nature, such as are involved in inter-agent communication and naive physics; however, it’s also
worth noting the potential importance of more abstract patterns distinguishing the everyday
world from arbitrary mathematical environments.

The propensity to search for hierarchical patterns is one huge potential example of an ab-
stract everyday-world property. We strongly suspect the reason that searching for hierarchical
patterns works so well, in so many everyday-world contexts, lies in the particular structure of
the everyday world — it’s not something that would be true across all possible environments
(even if one weights the space of possible environments in some clever way, say using program-
length according to some standard computational model). However, this sort of assertion is of
course highly “philosophical,” and becomes complex to formulate and defend convincingly given
the current state of science and mathematics.

Going one step further, we recall from Chapter 3 a structure called the “dual network”, which
consists of superposed hierarchical and heterarchical networks: basically a hierarchy in which
the distance between two nodes in the hierarchy is correlated with the distance between the
nodes in some metric space. Another high level property of the everyday world may be that dual
network structures are prevalent. This would imply that minds biased to represent the world in
terms of dual network structure are likely to be intelligent with respect to the everyday world.

In a different direction, the extreme commonality of symmetry groups in the (everyday and
otherwise) physical world is another example: they occur so often that minds oriented toward
recognizing patterns involving symmetry groups are likely to be intelligent with respect to the
real world.

We suspect that the number of cognitively-relevant properties of the everyday world is huge
... and that the essence of everyday-world intelligence lies in the list of varyingly abstract and
concrete properties, which must be embedded implicitly or explicitly in the structure of a natural
or artificial intelligence for that system to have everyday-world intelligence.

Apart from these particular yet abstract properties of the everyday world, intelligence is just
about “finding patterns in which actions tend to achieve which goals in which situations” ... but,
the simple meta-algorithm needed to accomplish this universally is, we suggest, only a small
percentage what it takes to make a mind.

You might say that a sufficiently generally intelligent system should be able to infer the
various cognitively-relevant properties of the environment from looking at data about the ev-
eryday world. We agree in principle, and in fact Ben Kuipers and his colleagues have done
some interesting work in this direction, showing that learning algorithms can infer some basics
about the structure of space and time from experience [MIX07]. But we suggest that doing this
really thoroughly would require a massively greater amount of processing power than an AGI
that embodies and hence automatically utilizes these principles. It may be that the problem of
inferring these properties is so hard as to require a wildly infeasible ATXI“ / Godel Machine
type system.

America into new black holes in the

Obama isn't worried about boots on the

uncertainty about the end state in Syria and
the risks of providing serious weapons to
the rebels (and a no-fly zone) that might
alter the arc of the fight against the regime,
the president saw and continues to see no

Syrian refugees are already sheltering inside Turkey, as are numerous
Syrian army defectors. Possibly anticipating Syrian retaliation, the
newspaper Hiirriyet reported that President Abdullah Giil recently
warned Assad would pay a heavy price for stirring up trouble in
Turkey's Kurdish south-east.

Fears that a Syrian meltdown could seriously destabilise the wider
neighbourhood are also driving Turkey's hardening response. Such a
scenario could affect Iraq, where security concerns are rising as the
US withdrawal nears completion, and even Iran, a close Assad ally.
For its part, the Syrian regime has pressing reasons to fear Ankara's
animosity, as Gékhan Bacik pointed out in Today's Zaman. Unlike
many Muslim countries, Turkey identifies strongly with Europe, the
US and Nato. And in the past decade, Erdogan's Justice and
Development party has made its brand of moderate Islamist politics
acceptable to previously blinkered western eyes.

In other words, Turkey, with its majority Sunni Muslim population,
furnishes a role model for the disenfranchised Sunni majority in Syria
(and other Arab spring countries). Not only is Ankara encouraging
revolution in Damascus, it is also living proof that Assad's politics of
fear are outdated, that Syrians have before them a workable
alternative paradigm, and that, after the revolution, the country's
secular, Islamist and other sectarian traditions could fairly hope to co-
exist peacefully, Turkish-style.

IMAGES-012-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033323.txt,"Does Trump Fit the Evolutionary Role of Narcissistic Sociopath?
Nathan H. Lents and Robert Trivers

There is no shortage of published psychological profiles of Donald J. Trump that
attempt to diagnose him, from a distance, as either a psychopath or a narcissistic
sociopath. These profiles, of course, are fatally hindered by the lack of access to Mr.
Trump for personal examination and completion of personality inventories.
However, exploration of the evolutionary features of these very peculiar personality
types may provide insight into this important question.

Psychopaths are indeed an evolutionary conundrum because their particular
behaviors are not an obvious path toward evolutionary success. For example, the
majority of serial killers are childless when they are killed or apprehended.
Narcissistic sociopaths, however, invariably [typically] have families and children
whom they support energetically, and many of the traits specific to this phenotype
can fairly be called adaptive. This raises the important issue of the evolutionary
niche of a narcissistic sociopath within the societies in which they exist.

The psychological profile of narcissistic sociopathy is generally agreed upon and
shares many features with psychopaths including above average intelligence,
considerable social savvy, adaptability, likeability, and natural skills in the
manipulation of others. They are charming, outgoing, and often feign interest in
people and subjects and can convincingly fake both sympathy and conscience. If
they engage in charitable acts at all, they are only in pursuit of ancillary selfish
benefits. They learn well from past experiences, and show no dedication to a set of
moral values, religious beliefs, truth, transparency. If they admire anyone, it is other
sociopaths that they wish to emulate. Finally, they are effective liars and show a
chilling unconcern for the welfare of others.

There is one particular skill that is common to both psychopaths and narcissistic
sociopaths and absolutely essential to their nature: cognitive empathy. Emotional
empathy, sometimes called emotional contagion, is regarded as the ability and
tendency to closely identify with the emotional experience of others, even “catching”
their emotions to a degree. Cognitive empathy is quite different. This is a mental skill
involving the close observation and interpretation of the actions and emotions of
others in order to understand and predict their behavior. It is morally neutral and
common in high-functioning individuals across the moral and ethical spectrum.
While social workers and therapists use cognitive empathy to help individuals
improve their lives, psychopaths and sociopaths use this skill to manipulate, coerce,
and deceive others in order to achieve their own ends. While emotional empathy is
an innate cognitive feature we share with most social mammals, cognitive empathy
is a skill that can be developed and refined and doing so is key to the behavioral
patterns of both psychopaths and sociopaths.

Finally, they went to London. ‘After we landed, we drove straight to Ghislaine’s house,’ says Virginia. ‘I

where we bought a couple of dresses, a pair of embroidered jeans and a pink singlet, perfume and make-
up.

When | went downstairs, Ghislaine and Jeffrey were in the lounge. There was a knock at the door.

of our tank, Yishai and I were firing back, our Uzis on automatic, and throwing
grenades. I could hear bullets pinging off the turret and the body of the tank.
Then, from our far right flank, came the shoulder-mounted Saggers, honing in
with their eerie blue-red glow, juddering towards us as the Egyptian soldiers
corrected their trajectories. One of the missiles barely missed us, and the silky
wire from its guidance mechanism was tangled over our turret. I tried using my
binoculars to identify where they were coming from, but it was no use.

To my right, I could see that the APCs had completed their first evacuation
run and were coming back for more of Yitzhik’s men. There was a raggedness
about it all: one APC, then a couple of others, then a gap, then another one or
two. They were doing whatever they could, whenever they could, as the
Egyptian fire continued to intensify. A few of Yitzhik’s men, whether desperate
or dazed, simply stood up and starting walking west, toward the canal, only to
be cut down by Egyptian gunfire.

I directed Moshe Sukenik to take half the company and head toward the
Saggers to try to take them out, even though we both knew that he’d have to
risk heavy fire before they got close enough. He had two-inch mortars on his
turret, but their range was only 500 yards, far less than the Saggers. Every 45
seconds or so, a salvo of Saggers zeroed in on our tanks and APCs. Within a
couple of minutes, two of the tanks were hit. One was on fire. The SU-100 tank-
destroyers were still there as well. Egyptian infantrymen were spraying us with
small arms fire. The whole area was swathed in grayish smoke. Every minute or
two, another tank or APC took a direct hit. There was a smell, too, which, once
experienced, never leaves your memory: the scent of burnt human flesh.

The fire from the foxholes was getting worse. “Run over them,” I ordered
my tank driver. “Start with the foxhole in front of us.” He jerked us forward and
we plowed over the first Egyptian position. “Reverse, get the one to the right,” I
said. As he backed up, I was shocked to see a surviving Egyptian soldier,
shrugging off a thick blanket of sand from his shoulders, raise an RPG launcher
at us from just 15 feet away. We were close enough to look into each other’s
eyes. I raised my Uzi and shot him before he could fire. Rifle and grenade fire
continued from along the line of foxholes. A second length of the Saggers’ silk-
like guidance wire tangled over our main gun. Yishai was firing at the
Egyptians from the other side of the tank. We both tossed grenades in the
direction of the worst of the gunfire.

Highlights from F2010 USA Inc. Financials

Summary — USA Inc. has challenges.

Cash Flow — While recession depressed F2008-F2010 results, cash flow has been negative
for 9 consecutive years ($4.8 trillion, cumulative), with no end to losses in sight. Negative
cash flow implies that USA Inc. can't afford the services it is providing to 'customers,’ many
of whom are people with few alternatives.

Balance Sheet — Net worth is negative and deteriorating.

Off-Balance Sheet Liabilities — Off-balance sheet liabilities of at least $31 trillion (primarily
unfunded Medicare and Social Security obligations) amount to nearly $3 for every $1 of debt
on the books. Just as unfunded corporate pensions and other post-employment benefits
(OPEB) weigh on public corporations, unfunded entitlements, over time, may increase USA
Inc.’s cost of capital. And today’s off-balance sheet liabilities will be tomorrow’s on-balance
sheet debt.

Conclusion — Publicly traded companies with similar financial trends would be pressed by
shareholders to pursue a turnaround. The good news: USA Inc.’s underlying asset base and
entrepreneurial culture are strong. The financial trends can shift toward a positive direction,
but both ‘management’ and ‘shareholders’ will need collective focus, willpower, commitment,
and sacrifice.

Note: USA federal fiscal year ends in September, Cash flow = total revenue — total spending on a cash basis; net worth includes
unfunded future liabilities from Social Security and Medicare on an accrual basis over the next 75 years. Source: cash flow per

Thinking with Clockwork

Astronomers have been predicting the motions of the heavens for
centuries and to do this they need accurate clocks. The very first clocks
were sundials. These suffered the obvious disadvantage of not working
at night, but it was also unsatisfactory to use the motion of the sun to
predict the motion of the sun. The earliest ‘heaven independent’ clocks
used water flowing through small holes in pottery vessels. They were
effective over short intervals but plagued by dust, dirt and evaporation.
It was the invention of the anchor escapement that enabled the first
accurate mechanical clocks.

By the sixteenth century clockmakers had gone to town developing
astrological clocks with more and more gears, to show all manner of
information; the phases of the moon, the motions of planets, even the
motion of moons orbiting those planets. These clocks became hugely
ornate. The astrological clock at Hampton Court Palace was built for
Henry VII circa 1542 and, as well as showing phases of the moon
and the signs of the zodiac, it accurately calculated the time of high
tide at London Bridge, allowing Henry to travel quickly to the Tower
of London. You might also notice it shows the sun orbiting the earth!
Copernicus published his book, De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On
the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres) showing the earth orbited the sun
a year later in 1543, and it took centuries before it became accepted fact.

Clocks need gears. The humble gear is a simple machine. They
work because wheels of different size have different circumferences — the
distance around the edge - but one full turn is the same for all wheels.

Epstein has denied he ever had any dealings with anyone from the insurance companies. But
Richard Allen says he recalls talking to Epstein at Hoffenberg’s direction and telling him it was
urgent they retrieve the missing bonds for a state examination. According to Allen, Epstein said,
“We'll get them back.” He had “kind of a flippant attitude,” says Allen. “They never came
back.”

Epstein, according to Hoffenberg, also came up with a scheme to manipulate the price of Emery
Freight stock in an attempt to minimize the losses that occurred when Hoffenberg’s bid went
wrong and the share price began to fall. This was alleged to have involved multiple clients’
accounts controlled by Epstein.

Eventually, in 1991, insurance regulators in Illinois sued Hoffenberg. He settled the case, and
Epstein, who was only a paid consultant, was never deposed or accused of any wrongdoing.
Barry Gross, the attorney who was handling the suit for the regulators, says of Epstein, “He was
very elusive.... It was hard to really track him down. There were a substantial number of checks
for significant dollars that were paid to him, I remember.... He was this character we never got a
handle on. Again we presumed that he was involved with the Pan Am and Emery run that
Hoffenberg made, but we never got a chance to depose him.”

“From the government’s discovery in the main sentencing against Hoffenberg it would seem the
government was perhaps a bit lazy,” says David Lewis, who represented Mitchell Brater. “They
went for what they knew they could get ... and that was the fraudulent promissory notes [i.e., the
much larger and unrelated part of Hoffenberg’s fraud, based in New York State].... What they
couldn’t get, they didn’t bother with.”

Another lawyer involved in the criminal prosecution of Hoffenberg says, “In a criminal
investigation like that, when there is a guilty plea, to be quick and dirty about it, discovery is
always incomplete.... They don’t have to line up witnesses; they don’t have to learn every fact
that might come out on cross-examination.”

Epstein was involved with Hoffenberg in other questionable transactions. Financial records show
that in 1988 Epstein invested $1.6 million in Riddell Sports Inc., a company that manufactures
football helmets. Among his co-investors were the theater mogul Robert Nederlander and
attorney Leonard Toboroff. A source close to this transaction claims that Epstein told
Nederlander and Toboroff that he had raised his share of the money from a Swiss banker, whose
identity they could not be allowed to know. But Hoffenberg has claimed the money came from
him, and Towers’s financial statements for that year show a loan to Epstein of $400,000.
(Epstein has said he can’t remember the details and has disputed the accuracy of the Towers
financial reports.)

Around the same time, Nederlander and Toboroff let Epstein come in with them on a scheme to
make money out of Pennwalt, a Pennsylvania chemical company. The plan was to group together
with two other parties to take a substantial declared position in the stock. According to a source,
Epstein was supposed to help Nederlander and Toboroff raise $15 million. He seemed to fail to
find other investors, say those familiar with the deal. (Epstein has said he was merely an
investor.) He invested $1 million, which he told his co-investors was his own money. But in his

court cross examination by Tyson's trial lawyer, the issue of the contingency fee agreement was
explicitly raised. Yet, the prosecutor did everything in his power to keep the truth from coming
out. He arranged for the Washington family to take the courtroom pass away from their lawyer,
so that he could not attend the trial and feel ethically compelled to stand up and correct the
Washingtons' testimony when they falsely denied any contingency fee or written agreement with
him. (The prosecutor also had an ethical obligation to correct the false testimony given by his
witness. Indeed he had an even greater obligation because he was the one who put on the
testimony that he knew was false.)

The ploy worked—at least for a while. But the Rhode Island lawyer soon learned that his clients
were not being straight with the jury. He began to worry that he might have an ethical obligation
to blow the whistle on his clients, as lawyers do when their clients or witnesses are committing
perjury. So the lawyer went to the Rhode Island Disciplinary Counsel—the attorney in charge of
enforcing the ethical rules that govern lawyers—to obtain guidance. She referred the matter to
the Rhode Island Supreme Court which issued an unprecedented opinion concluding that “the
attorney had an obligation to disclose the existence of his contingent fee agreement to the
[Indiana] criminal trial court.” The state’s highest court found that the agreement’s “existence
might well have had a bearing upon the jury’s determination.” The Rhode Island court then
directed the attorney to disclose to the Indiana court the information that the Washingtons had
withheld. He did so but the Indiana courts ignored this new information, despite the conclusion
of the Rhode Island Supreme Court that it might well have affected the jury’s verdict. Indeed,
what could be more important than the fact—unbeknownst to the jury—that Desiree Washington
had millions of dollars riding on whether Mike Tyson was convicted or acquitted, since without a
conviction, it would have been difficult for her to collect monetary damages or sell her story to
the media. The only thing that might have been more important is that she had been untruthful
about her financial motive for accusing Tyson of rape.

It also turns out that Desiree was hardly the naive virgin she pretended to be. Once her name was
disclosed following the trial, numerous witnesses confirmed that Desiree Washington was a
sexually active young woman who hung out in nightclubs. Indeed, her lawyer implied to the media
that Washington had been examined for venereal disease a month before she had sex with Tyson
and that she was not sexually active during that brief period.

Not only was the jury misinformed about Desiree Washington's general sexual proclivities, they
were also denied the most crucial eyewitness testimony of what she was doing just minutes before
she went to Tyson's hotel room. She denied necking with Tyson in the limo on the way to the
hotel. Indeed, she testified that she rebuffed his attempt to kiss her and jumped back. Tyson's
testimony was precisely the opposite. He swore that when he kissed her, she kissed me, and that
on the drive to his hotel, he and Washington were kissing, touching. The jury obviously believed
Desiree's testimony because Tyson's was uncorroborated and self-serving.

But it turns out that there were three eyewitnesses -- disinterested outsiders who happened to be
in front of the hotel when the limo pulled up -- who saw what was going on inside and outside the
limo just before Tyson and Washington left it to go to his hotel room. They saw them necking --
they were all over each other -- and holding hands on the way to the hotel (Desiree denied both
necking and holding hands).

I began by asking him about one of the more celebrated cases he
had handled for the KGB, that of Ames, who had acted as a Russian
mole in the CIA between April 1985 and January 1994. In those nine
years, he rose, or was maneuvered by the KGB, into a top position
in the CIA’s highly sensitive Counterintelligence Center Analysis
Group, which allowed him to deliver hundreds of top secrets to the
KGB. In return, according to Cherkashin, Ames received between
$20,000 and $50,000 in cash for each delivery, which amounted to
$4.6 million over the nine years.

Tasked Cherkashin about the weakness the KGB looked for in an
American intelligence worker that might lead him to copy and steal
top secret documents. How did he spot a potential Ames? Was it a
financial problem? Was it a sexual vulnerability? Was it an ideologi-
cal leaning?

“Nothing so dramatic,” he answered. When assessing Ames’s
biographical data, Cherkashin said he was looking for a well-placed
intelligence officer who was both dissatisfied with and antagonistic
to the service for which he worked.

© “The classic disgruntled employee,” I interjected. ®

“Any intelligence officer who strongly feels that his superiors are
not listening to him, and that they are doing stupid things, is a can-
didate,” he continued. He said he had found that the flaw in a pros-
pect that could be most dependably exploited was not his greed, lust,
or deviant behavior but his resentment over the way he was being
treated.

“Is that how you spotted Ames?”

“Actually, he approached us, not vice versa.” It was his job in the
CIA to approach opposition KGB officers. “But, yes, we saw the
potential,” he said.

Because Ames had been paid $50,000 in cash by Cherkashin for
his first delivery, I asked whether he fit into the category of a dis-
gruntled employee.

“Wasn't he just a mercenary?” I asked.

“I knew from our intelligence reports that he needed money
for debts stemming from his divorce,” he answered. “But he was
also angry at the stupidity and paranoia of those running the CIA.
Ames told me at our first secret meeting that they were misleading

right.'°° The reason for adopting such a broad right was that “[t]oo often
victims of crime experience a secondary victimization at the hands of the
criminal justice system. This provision is intended to direct Government
agencies and employees, whether they are in the executive or judiciary
branch, to treat victims of crime with the respect they deserve.”!°° OLC’s
failure to consider the purposes underlying the CVRA is a glaring
oversight.

OLC never attempts to explain why the CVRA’s drafters would want
victims to have a right to fair treatment once criminal charges were filed but
possess no such right before the filing of criminal charges. Clearly, many
victims can and do suffer secondary victimization during criminal
investigations, such as when sexual assault victims are treated
inappropriately by law enforcement agents.'°’ It would contradict the
purpose of preventing victim mistreatment in the criminal justice system to
artificially limit the right to fairness to the point at which charges are filed.
The night to fairness logically applies at all stages of the criminal justice
process.

C. OLC’S INEFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO THE CVRA’S COVERAGE AND
VENUE PROVISIONS

At the end of its memorandum, OLC finally discusses what it
identifies as the two strongest arguments for construing the CVRA as
applying before charging: the coverage provision and the venue provision.
OLC acknowledges, as it must, that the CVRA’s coverage extends to any
federal employee engaged in “the defection, investigation or prosecution of
crime.”'*’ Such employees “shall make their best efforts to see that crime
victims are notified of, and accorded, the rights” afforded by the statute.'°’
Notably, this duty applies to individuals not just in the Justice Department
(where all federal prosecutors are located) but other agencies as well, such

like the Yom Kippur War happens to a country, and to a government, they must
lose power. They wi// lose power.” He was right. Only twice in the four decades
that followed would a Labor leader defeat Begin’s Likud party: Rabin’s election
victory in 1992, and mine over Bibi Netanyahu in 1999.

During the first two years of Begin’s rule, however, I was 7,000 miles away.
Ten days before the election, I’d gone to see Motta, and he’d agreed that I could
return to Stanford, to finish what I’d barely begun when the 1973 war broke out.
I had been in the army, with the one hiatus as a sayeret reservist at Hebrew
University, since the age of seventeen. I did not regret committing myself to a
life in uniform. But Stanford offered an extraordinary opportunity to broaden
my horizons. Even in the few weeks I’d spent there before the war, I'd felt
reinvigorated. It engaged a different kind of intelligence, a different part of who
I was: the books, the professors. A chance to listen to, and at least try to play,
beautiful music. And to spend more than a few stolen evenings or weekends
with my family.

The timing had nothing to do with the election. Like most other Labor
Israelis, and many of Begin’s own supporters, I hadn’t expected the Likud to
win. It was because I felt I'd reached a natural punctuation mark in my military
career. I’d led Sayeret Matkal. I’d commanded a tank company, a battalion in
1973, and, more briefly than I’d hoped, the 401° Brigade after the war. I’d spent
the last two years in the kirva. The next step up the command chain would be to
lead a full armored division. But at age 35, I was probably too young, and I
figured I’d have a far better chance in two years’ time. I also feared losing the
chance to go to Stanford altogether. Motta’s term as chief of staff would end the
following year. Among those in the frame to succeed him was Raful Eitan.
Recalling Raful’s dismissive, almost sneering, opposition to my making the
Sayeret Matkal into Israel’s SAS, I wasn’t exactly confident I could count on
his support.

— How would public shareholders view USA Inc.?

e What Have We Found?

— USA Inc.’s finances — short-term and long-term, income statement

into the US, not Canadians and Eskimos. So Trump is erecting a barrier against
Darlington’s Rule—migration is always tropics outward. Africa is the center of the
tropics in the entire globe. Before that it was part of Gondwanaland (Africa, South
America, Antarctic) but it was the center of that super-continent, and therefore most

tropical section, so Darlington’s rule held back then, as we know from fossils.

BTW it is striking that there is strong evidence that selection from parasites has
been increasing over the past 40,000 years with an acceleration of positive selection to a
striking degree—before agriculture and animal husbandry which added further
acceleration associated with orders of magnitude (5 Or 6) increases in density. There are
“signatures” that genes show of recent strong positive selection, basically comparing
neutral sites (change in DNA has no effect on structure of associated protein) with non-

neutral sites and seeing if the latter evolve while the former show a random walk.

And what are the chief “selected variants”? Parasite-resistant genes.

Now these are automatically selected when density increases because parasites LOVE
density--consider people packed in a room breathing on each other, or water-born
parasites traveling quickly to others, or vector-borne parasites, e.g. malaria--if one in ten
humans are sick but widely dispersed a mosquito biting the sick person rarely passes on
the Plasmodium but if dense, every tenth person gives it to the mosquito who quickly

passes it on
Likewise parasites like mobility--which increases density of contacts--so Haitians acquired

HIV-1 because their middle class served as the middle class of emerging French-speaking

African nations with high HIV, and they brought back the disease with them when they

the work it would be more desirable to simply report the quantitative findings,
leaving unanswerable questions about ultimate causality for later discussion (see

below).

The first EEG 4(+) was reported in a patient with epilepsy (Babloyantz and

Destexhe, 1986) which was confirmed by others (lasemedia et al, 1988; Frank et
all, 1990). An important study of simultaneous time series from 16 subdural
electrodes placed in the right temporal cortex of a patient with a right medial
temporal lobe epileptogenic focus demonstrated that a decrease in a single lead’s
A(+) reliably anteceded and localized the first signs of the incipient seizure. The
rest of the leads followed with similarly decreased positivity in their leading
Lyapounov exponents associated with spatially coherent patterns of behavior. In
addition, the averaged value of the leading Lyapounov exponents in the 16 leads
increased post-ictally over the averaged values of 4(+)in the pre-ictal state
(lasemidis et al, 1988,1990). These findings, including seizure anticipation for 25
minutes, were confirmed using intracranial recordings in 16 patients with temporal

lobe epilepsy (Elger and Lehnertz, 1998). The para-ictal decrease and post-ictal
increase in 4(+) found in patients with focal temporal lobe seizures was confirmed

more generally in left and right pre-frontal-to-mastoid EEG recordings made before,
during and after electroconvulsive shock treatment of psychiatric patients (Krystal
and Weiner, 1991). Pre-ictal changes were also found six minutes before seizure
onset from scalp EEG recordings in 17/19 patients with chronic focal epilepsy
(Martinerie et al, 1998). The most exciting potential application of this approach is
its use, in real time, for the prediction and prophylactic treatment of incipient
seizures, minutes to hours before the event, in place of or augmenting long term

drug management (lasemidis and Sackellares, 1996).

There is a growing literature about leading Lyapounov exponent(s) in the
reconstructed attractor of the EEG associated with a variety of normal and

pathological human behavioral states. For examples, two and sometimes three

The bots did the sweep. Here are the new results taken as of a minute ago. You have only one negative article
left on front page of google, which is the Huffington Post article. The Huffington Post is extremely hard to
move, because it is so powerful, has millions of links to it, and uploads massive new and original content it on
a daily basis with posting from out side readers. We managed to push it down the page, as it used to be at the
top. If we were able to post original content to both the science and the org site (absolutely not a single word
to this day by Jessica, just talk), we would have been able to push it down even further, and off the page. WE
did manage to get rid of the daily beast article, which is now far removed, inspite of their own efforts to keep
it prominent.

Toxic suggested search engine terms that popped up automatically when you typed in your name are also now
removed.

Wikipedia was an important victory, as it will always be at the top of the search engine results. ow the head
lines do not mention convicted sex offender or pedophile. Instead, Philanthrophic work, Epstein Foundation,
Promotion of Scientists. We have stopped the hacking on your wiki site, and that was a major effor. Your
wiki entry now is pretty tame, and bad stuff has been muted, bowlerized, and pused to the bottom. Careful
editing and wording has muted the effect immensely. We hacked the site to replace the mug shot and caption,
and now has an entirely different photo and caption. This was a big success.

We pushed the Edge all the way up to the front page, where it was previously buried on page 5 of google
search.

We have promoted the other jeffrey epsteins, and other pages are also filled with your material.

And, while the sites are up, and in the direction we hoped, they are still new, and subject to volitility,
especially if new original content is not added on a minimum of a weekly basis. I have been forbideen to add
new content to the philanthrophic site as well as the science site, and therefore, as a result our rating slipped
down (still on the first page, but would have liked them (and some of the articles to been able to push
Huffington off page). We also helped with you images, and the first images that come of you on a google
search are not of your mug shot, etc.

Your daily beast foe is still at it, and trying to promote her sites against you in the same way that we try to
depromote you.

As far as this site is concerned, and the continuation of this, I do not know what you wish to do. Clearly, you
have no interest in my continuing. And, I am not sure if you want to continue the project at all. If the latter,
and you stop, eventually it will just go into the way of entropy, and it will return to the old form. The major
work has been done, but it needs to be maintained. For it to get better results, it needs to have constant input
and supervision, and that means generating proper content, not just editing and grammatical fixes. Writers
need to know what to write. THe philanthrophy site is at the bottom of the page precisely because you have
not allowed us to add any content to it, and as a result it suffers.

You paid Mike $2500, which he applied for the purchasing of his replacement servers, but his fee of $7500

balance is now due if you want to continue. Please let me know what you want to do. I need to inform him,
and if you are not going to use him, he needs to take on his other clients and devote his time there.

This needs to be contrasted with what we started with, which was a search on your name, which had nine/10
very toxic prominent stories, and toxic Wiki article and headline.

Claus Von Bulow

After we won the case, Claus and his then girlfriend decided to host a dinner party. I told them I
would not come if it was a victory party, since I have a policy of not going to victory parties of
criminal defendants. He assured me that it was merely a dinner for several interesting people. He
told me among his other guests would be the novelist Norman Mailer and his wife. When the
dinner began, Claus regaled everybody with stories from the trial and I explained why the
evidence seemed to point to his innocence. About halfway through the dinner, Mailer grabbed his
wife’s arm and said, “Let’s get out of here. I think this guy is innocent. I thought we were going
to be having dinner with a man who actually tried to kill his wife. This is boring.” In fact, many
of my most exciting cases involved very boring people, though Claus was not one of them. When
the movie came out, Claus refused to go to see it insisting that he would never watch Jeremy
Irons play him. Several months later I was having lunch with Claus and his most recent girlfriend
who I had never previously met. After about an hour of conversation with me, she turned to
Claus and said, “Now that I’ve met Alan I believe that Ron Silver really didn’t do him justice. He
overplayed him.” Claus immediately shook his head in agreement saying, “You’re right my dear,
I too think he overplayed him.” This from a man who claimed he didn’t see the film.

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024528.txt,"School Partnerships

School Partnerships is projected to grow from $48.5 million in pro forma revenues in 2005 to $138.14
million in 2011. As a percentage of revenue, School Partnerships accounts for 3.3% of total pro forma
revenue in 2005, and is projected to grow to 6.0% in 2011. KLC OpCo projects that growth in the School
Partnerships business will be primarily driven by growth in the SES market (more school districts required
to offer supplemental services), and an increase in the number of parent pay locations in the U.S.

KC Distance Learning

KCDL is projected to grow from $10.0 million in pro forma revenues in 2005 to $41.6 million in 2011, Asa
percentage of revenue, KCDL accounts for 0.7% of total pro forma revenue in 2005, and is projected to
grow to 1.8% in 2011. KLC OpCo projects that growth in this line will predaminantly come from the
expansion of KCDL's direct to family business (which currently accounts for approximately 90% of pro
forma revenue) and the expansion of states to digital high school courses (which KLC believes it is in a
position to provide on an outsourced basis).

Gross Margin

KLC OpCo's pro forma gross profit is projected to increase from $244.4 million in 2005 to $501.3 million
in 2011. The growth in gross profit is projected to be largely driven by increased center efficiency as a
result of improved Utilization, continued tuition increases and the closure of underperforming centers and
shift in the revenue mix to more profitable business lines (/.e., more employer-sponsored centers, KCDL,
ancillary products and services). KLC OpCo's gross margin is projected to improve from approximately
16.5% of total revenues in fiscal year 2006 to 21.9% in fiscal year 2011 as a result of these factors.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Due to the relatively fixed nature of KLC OpCo's selling, general and administrative (GG&A) expenses,
KLC OpCo projects that SG&A will increase at a rate of 4.5% annually after 2006. Additionally,
management estimates that there will be a one-time increase of $2.0 in SG&A related to the expansion of
the SES business in 2007.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margins

KLC OpCo projects improving pro forma Adjusted EBITDA from $149.9 million in fiscal year 2005 to
$320.1 million in fiscal year 2011. Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to improve from 10.1%
in fiscal year 2005 to 14.0% in fiscal year 2011. This projected margin improvement reflects the

combination of increasing sales and margin improvements outlined above. The table below shows the
calculation of pro forma Adjusted EBITDA.

Context & Procedure — Goal

and considered more formally as holds(C) & ex(P) > h, where h may be an externally specified
goal g; or an internally specified goal h derived as a (possibly uncertain) subgoal of one of more
gi; C is a piece of declarative or episodic knowledge and P is a procedure that the agent can
internally execute to generate a series of actions. ex(P) is the proposition that P is successfully
executed. If C is episodic then holds(C) may be interpreted as the current context (i.e. some
finite slice of the agent’s history) being similar to C; if C is declarative then holds(C) may be
interpreted as the truth value of C' evaluated at the current context. Note that C may refer to
some part of the world quite distant from the agent’s current sensory observations; but it may
still be formally evaluated based on the agent’s history.

In the standard CogPrime notation as introduced formally in Chapter 20 (where indentation
has function-argument syntax similar to that in Python, and relationship types are prepended
to their relata without parentheses), for the case C is declarative this would be written as

PredictiveExtensionallmplication
AND
C
Execution P

G

and in the case C' is episodic one replaces C in this formula with a predicate expressing C’s
similarity to the current context. The semantics of the PredictiveExtensionalInheritance relation
will be discussed below. The Execution relation simply denotes the proposition that procedure
P has been executed.

For the class of SRAM agents who (like CogPrime) use the cognitive schematic to govern
many or all of their actions, a significant fragment of agent intelligence boils down to estimating
the truth values of PredictiveExtensionallmplication relationships. Action selection procedures
can be used, which choose procedures to enact based on which ones are judged most likely
to achieve the current external goals g; in the current context. Rather than enter into the
particularities of action selection or other cognitive architecture issues, we will restrict ourselves
to PLN inference, which in the context of the present agent model is a method for handling
Predictivelmplication in the cognitive schematic.

Consider an agent in a virtual world, such as a virtual dog, one of whose external goals is to
please its owner. Suppose its owner has asked it to find a cat, and it can translate this into a
subgoal “find cat.” If the agent operates according to the cognitive schematic, it will search for
P so that

PredictiveExtensionallmplication
AND
C
Execution P
Evaluation

cat

holds.

subsidizes cheap money and keeps lending rates low. Most tradition associates easy
money with growth and prosperity. Higher interest rates are associated with

restraint in investment and consumption both. Modigliani was right to worry.

My guess is that the bank reform and money reform | propose would drive
borrowing costs up, borrowing volume down, and equity investment up to fill the
gap. Corporations would issue new stock to retire corporate debt. Newlyweds

would rent, not buy, until their incomes were high enough to bring other options.

Modigliani was also worried that monetary policy would become impossible. It
would as we know it. | have argued elsewhere that fiscal policy can be made to work
as well and as fast. And | will argue for an unusual and more direct form of monetary

policy. But no one knows.

These concerns are reasons to go slow. I think that the reforms I describe are
developing now, with no input from me, and will continue if they succeed.
Depositors will be attracted away from banks to ETF accounts of equal liquidity and
full return. Federal deposit insurance will not be advantage enough to hold them.
Banks will get the message and join the parade by spinning off their loan
departments and investing deposits in ETFs. If Modigliani’s valid concerns haven’t
found good answers, the parade will stop until they do. It could backtrack to the
starting point. The reforms | believe in ought to work, but can be scrubbed without

much mess if they don't.

] am not their only advocate. Others argue for splitting up commercial banks more
or less as | would. Meanwhile many people maintain liquidity in ETFs or mutual
funds rather than banks. There may be some originality in putting the two reforms

together.

controls (Elbert et al, 1992). The Dz computed on the EEG during Stage IV (“delta”)
sleep was sensitive to acute sleep deprivation and recovery, but demonstrated
compensation (Cerf et al, 1996). Non-alcholic children of alcoholic parents
manifested lower values for D; in their EEG attractors than the children of a normal
control group (Ehlers et al, 1995). Higher |.Q. correlated with EEG Dz in most leads
in the resting state but not during a visual imagery task (Lutzenberger et al, 1992).
These differences also correlated with individual differences in task performance in
a perceptual pattern predictive task (Gregson et al, 1990) and with a working
memory task load with regional differences most marked in the right fronto-temporal

cortex (Sammer, 1996).

Peripheral nerve stimulation in the earlobe and trapezius muscle induced
increments in Dz in the EEG of specific brain regions (Heffernan, 1996). Memory for
but not induced pain increased EEG D2 in chronic pain patients but not in normal
controls (Lutzenberger et al, 1997). Using contingent reinforcement of brain wave
modes by hypothalamic, but not cerebral hemispheric, stimulation reduced Dz in the
EEG (Mogilevskii et al, 1998) resembling the changes accompanying defensive
reflex conditioning in the rabbit between the early and late stages of the process
(Efremova and Kulikov, 1997). Difficult to diagnose “periodic lateralized epileptiform
discharge” syndromes have apparently yielded to D2 computations (Stam et al,
1998). In equally problematic “atypical seizure” syndromes in children, D2 computed
on the autocovariance functions of 200 Hz digitized EEG records from multiple

channels demonstrated characteristic changes (Yaylali et al, 1996).

Unlike computing a reliable leading 4(+)on a point set of a time series

reconstruction denoting the “sensitivity to initial conditions” requirement for the

diagnosis of chaos (and a potential for change such that a decrease in the positivity
of A(+) > 4(0) may auger a nearby bifurcation), the presence of a fractional scaling

exponent, D,, does not in and of itself implicate a chaotic dynamical state. A nice

example of a nonchaotic dynamic with 4 = 0 that has a fractional scaling exponent,

D = 0.538, is the “Feigenbaum” point where the above noted “infinite” series of

vastly overstates its position when it asserts that “most courts ... have
declined to extend enforceable nghts under the CVRA to alleged victims of
conduct that did not lead to criminal proceedings.”'' All the courts that
have actually reached the issue have concluded exactly the opposite.''®

B. OLC’S DISTORTION OF THE CVRA’S STRUCTURE AND LEGISLATIVE
HISTORY

The next section of OLC’s memorandum maintains that the CVRA’s
structure and legislative history lead to the conclusion that the CVRA is
“best understood” as extending rights after charges have been filed. Here
again, OLC’s analysis is truncated at best and misleading at worst.

OLC begins this part of its analysis by observing that some of the
rights in the CVRA are limited to court proceedings. OLC notes, for
example, that the CVRA gives victims the “right to reasonable, accurate,
and timely notice of any public court proceeding ... involving the
crime.”''’ But the fact that some of the rights listed in the CVRA apply to
court proceedings hardly means that all of the rights are to be so restricted.
The federal criminal justice process includes stages that are pre-charging,
post-charging, and post-conviction. It would hardly be surprising to find
that a statute that Congress intended to be “broad and encompassing”™!!®
covered events occurring after the filing of charges.

Indeed, OLC appears to recognize that at least three of the rights listed
in the CVRA could easily apply before charges are filed: (1) the “right to be
reasonably protected from the accused”; (2) the “reasonable right to confer
with the attorney for the Government in the case”; and (3) the “right to be
treated with faimess and with respect for the victim’s dignity and
privacy.”!!° None of these rights explicitly refer to court “proceedings” or
other events (such as parole hearings) that necessarily occur after the filing
of formal charges.'”°

15 OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 5-6. Notably, the Department does not
embrace the language from Huff found within the Skinner and Paletz decisions because
presumably such an approach would be contrary to many of the rights found in the CVRA.

16 See infra Part I.C.

'T OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 6 (emphasis added) (quoting 18 U.S.C.
§ 3771(a)(2)).

°° OLC appears to have overlooked another right that could well apply before charges
are filed: the right to be notified of one’s rights under the CVRA. See 18 U.S.C.
§ 3771(c)(1) (requiring prosecutors to “make their best efforts to see that crime victims are
notified of, and accorded, the rights described in [the CVRA]”); United States v. Rubin, 558

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025150.txt,"SCIENCE IN THE SOUL

Selected Shorter Writings
By Richard Dawkins, Edited by Gillian Somerscales
[UK — Transworld; Manuscript; Pub Date: June 2017; 110,000 words]

A new book from Richard Dawkins, internationally bestselling author and one of the greatest scientists of our
age. As much as his full length books such as The Selfish Gene, The Blind Watchmaker, and The God Delusion,
have changed our perceptions of both science and the world it opens, his essays and articles are potent, pithy,
thought provoking and revealing windows into the world as he, himself, perceives it. Science in the Soul is a
collection of some of Dawkins' best writing: articles and lectures, reflections and polemics, reviews, forewords,
tributes or eulogies, both published and unpublished.

From the introduction, by Gillian Somerscales: Richard Dawkins has always defied categorization. One
eminent biologist of mathematical bent reviewing The Selfish Gene and The Extended Phenotype was startled to
find a scientific work apparently free of logical errors and yet containing not a single line of mathematics; he
could come to no other conclusion than that, incomprehensible as it seemed to him, “Dawkins . . . apparently
thinks in prose.’

If readers of what follows here come to appreciate not only the writer’s clarity of thought and facility of
expression, the fearlessness with which he confronts very large elephants in very small rooms, the energy with
which he devotes himself to explication of the complex and the beautiful in science, but also some of the
generosity, kindness and courtesy that have characterized all my dealings with Richard over the years since that
first collaboration, then the present volume will have achieved one of its aims.

It will have achieved another if it embodies a condition felicitously described in one of the essays reproduced
here, where ‘harmonious parts flourish in the presence of each other, and the illusion of a harmonious whole
emerges.’ Indeed, it is my belief that the harmony resounding from this collection is no illusion, but the echo of
one of the most vibrant, and vital, voices of our times.

RICHARD DAWKINS is the former Charles Simonyi Professor For The Understanding Of Science at Oxford
University; Fellow of New College; author of The Selfish Gene, The Extended Phenotype, The Blind
Watchmaker, River out of Eden (ScienceMasters Series), Climbing Mount Improbable, Unweaving the
Rainbow, The Devil's Chaplain, The Ancestor's Tale, The God Delusion, The Greatest Show on Earth and The
Magic of Reality. He 1s founder of The Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science.

FROM BACTERIA TO BACH AND BACK

The Evolution of Minds

By Daniel C. Dennett

[US — W. W. Norton, UK — Penguin UK, Italy — Raffaello Cortina Editore, Holland — Atlas
Contact, China — Cheers, Audio — Recorded Books; Manuscript; Pub Date: February 2017; 448 pages]

One of the world’s foremost philosophers offers a major new account of the origins of the conscious mind.
What is human consciousness and how is it possible? This question fascinates people from poets and painters to
physicists, psychologists, and philosophers. From Bacteria to Bach and Back is Daniel C. Dennett’s brilliant
answer, extending perspectives from his earlier work in surprising directions, exploring the deep interactions of

evolution, brains, and human culture.

Part philosophical whodunit, part bold scientific conjecture, this landmark work enlarges themes that have
sustained Dennett’s legendary career at the forefront of philosophical thought. In his mimitable style—laced

dependence on foreign oil (“end” is the word used). This is an appealing proposition, particularly with Brent oil prices now 5 times
higher than natural gas prices on a BTU basis. So, let’s assume that the US wanted to cease all oil imports from Venezuela, Russia and
the Persian Gulf. This would reduce oil imports by ~30%. If Americans still wanted to drive around just as much, absent an increase
of 2.8 million bpd in US domestic crude production, electricity would have to replace the foregone gasoline. Ergo: how much wind
power or natural gas would be needed, assuming electric cars at 200 watt hours per km? And what policies would be needed on
fracking, eminent domain, and subsidies for high voltage direct current power lines to transmit electricity at acceptable loss rates?

Note: the charts below only account for the foregone gasoline component of the imported crude oil. Gasoline is only around 45%-
50% of total refined products. The US would also have to come up with suitable domestic or foreign replacements for the rest of the
barrel: jet fuel, heating oil, fuel oil, lube oils, asphalt, etc. This is a topic that is often neglected in discussions about reducing reliance
on foreign oil: we do a lot more with it than just drive cars.

Unfortunately, it turns out the AIDS virus can even mutate its functional
parts, but this is harder. The probability of a successful functional
mutation is 1000 times less likely than a simple aesthetic mutation to the
sugar coat.

Triple drug therapy works by attacking three different functional
elements of the virus simultaneously. It is possible for the virus to modify
all these functional elements but the likelihood of it doing so is tiny.
One mutation alone does not help because the drug cocktail will still
target the other two elements and kill the virus. The AIDS virus does not
understand that it is facing a triple drug cocktail. It cannot reason like a
sentient being and random chance is not sufficient to make the big leap
necessary to overcome the cocktail of drugs. Unless you can mutate all
three elements at once your time as a virus particle on this planet is over.
Most problems we have to solve in this world require more than one
simultaneous logical step and these don't happen by chance.

that he would end his life with her. When the children learned of this, they pleaded with their
father not to take his life. Peter relented. No one tried to talk Patricia out of her decision to
commit suicide, for two reasons: first, she had made up her mind; second, it wasn’t really suicide,
since her act would only hasten her imminent and painful demise by a few weeks.

Patricia selected the day and time of her death and planned a formal farewell dinner for her family.
Among those in attendance, in addition to her husband and children, were her stepfather and her
two half brothers.

There was wine and toasts. Patricia wore an elegant dress and had her nails polished. After
dinner they watched the movie Harold and Maude, about an elderly woman who commits suicide
to prevent herself from “growing old.” When it was over, Peter Rosier and his wife retired to the
bedroom and made love. After bidding farewell to family members, Patricia Rosier took twenty
pills that she had selected for her suicide. She quickly fell into a coma, from which she expected
never to wake. Had her suicide succeeded, there would have been no case.

But soon the coma began to lighten. Peter didn’t know what to do or what to think. Would she
awaken or remain comatose? Would there be brain damage? Pain? Emotional turmoil? All
Peter knew was that his wife did not want to awaken. What was his obligation to his comatose
wife? Would he be breaking his final promise to her if he did not assist her in achieving her goal:
a painless and dignified death? He could not ask her advice. The decision was his to make, but it
was her decision—she had already made it and acted on it, albeit incompletely.

Peter administered morphine, but it was not enough. While Peter was outside the house, pacing
and crying, Patricia’s stepfather decided to end her life by suffocating her. He placed his hands
over her nose and mouth. She died in her sleep.

The stepfather and brothers simply informed Peter that Patricia had died, without providing any
further details. For nearly a year, the circumstances surrounding Patricia’s death remained a
family secret. Then Peter decided to do something foolhardy: he wrote a book about his late
wife’s courage and gave an interview to a local television reporter in which he related what he
believed were the circumstances of his wife’s death, still unaware that her stepfather had
administered the coup de grace.

As soon as the interview was aired, the local prosecutor began a murder investigation. They
wanted to interview Patricia’s stepfather, but he demanded total immunity from prosecution for
himself and his sons as a condition of being interviewed. That should have tipped off the
authorities that he might have something to hide. But instead of asking for a “proffer” —a truthful
outline of the facts—before deciding whether to grant immunity, the prosecutor simple agreed to
his condition.

The stepfather then disclosed for the first time that it was he who had caused Patricia’s death.
The prosecutors had committed a blunder feared by every law-enforcement official: they gave the
wrong person immunity. But they could not back out of their deal. Now the only possible target
was Peter Rosier.

Despite the certainty that Peter had not actually killed his wife, and that she wanted to take her
own life, the prosecutor treated the loving husband as if he were indeed the triggerman in a

If you undertake an experiment I would appreciate your leaving a
note of your results on the website and making useful comments on the
blog.

Most of the experiments and puzzles are quick and simple. The
puzzles I have set often benefit from creative thinking. I have made
finding the answers to these problems a little hard, so you are not
tempted to cheat. I want you to try to solve the problems and ‘feel’ your
brain working.

This book argues that intuitive thought solves problems in a
different way to analytical thought. The process takes time and often
benefits from putting a problem to one side while you use your mind
to process foreground tasks. I hope you read this book at a time when
the website is not available — or at least don't peek. Give your intuitive
thought processes time to work.

Graham Wallas described the process of creative thinking in 1926
and I think it is still one of the best models we have:

First you must prepare and become fully acquainted
with the problem. It might seem impossible but don't despair,
just commit to it. Next, you should leave the problem to
stew — incubation, he called it. After a while, you will feel
a solution is at hand. You don’t quite have it yet but you are

unpleasant-looking fluids (yellow, reddish-orange, brown), dry materials (sawdust?
flour?), and even insects drizzle or dust their way down the head, whose stoic sublimity is
made gorgeously virtual on the work’s enormous screens. Dead Imagine, through its
large-scale and cubic “Platonic” form, remains both artificial and locked into the body—
refusing a detached “intelligence” as being no intelligence at all.

Artists in the new millennium inherit this critical tradition and inhabit the current
paradigms of AI, which has slid from partial simulations to claims of intelligence. In the
1955 proposal thought to be the first printed usage of the phrase “artificial intelligence,”
computer scientist John McCarthy and his colleagues Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel
Rochester, and Claude Shannon conjectured that “every aspect of learning or any other
feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be
made to simulate it.” This modest theoretical goal has inflated over the past sixty-four
years and is now expressed by Google DeepMind as an ambition to “Solve intelligence.”
Crack the code! But unfortunately, what we hear cracking is not code but small-scale
capitalism, the social contract, and the scaffolding of civility. Taking away the jobs of
taxi and truck drivers, roboticizing direct marketing, hegemonizing entertainment,
privatizing utilities, and depersonalizing health care—are these the “whips” that Wiener
feared we would learn to love?

Artists can’t solve any of this. But they can remind us of the creative potential of
the paths not taken—the forks in the road that were emerging around 1970, before
“information” became capital and “intelligence” equaled data harvesting. Richly
evocative of what can be done with contemporary tools when revisiting earlier
possibilities is French artist Philippe Parreno’s “firefly piece,” so nicknamed to avoid
having to iterate its actual title: With a Rhythmic Instinction to Be Able to Travel Beyond
Existing Forces of Life (2014). Described by the artist as “an automaton,” the sculptural
installation juxtaposes a flickering projection of black-and-white drawings of fireflies
with a band of oscillating green-on-black binary figures. The drawings and binary
figures are animated using algorithms from mathematician John Horton Conway’s 1970
Game of Life, a “cellular automaton.”

Conway set up parameters for any square (“cell”) to be lit (“alive”) or dark
(“dead”) in an infinite, two-dimensional grid. The rules are summarized as follows: A
single cell will quickly die of loneliness. But a cell touching three or more other “live”
cells will also die, “due to crowding.” A cell survives and thrives if it has just two
neighbors... and soon. As one cell dies, it may create the conditions for other cells to
survive, yielding patterns that appear to move and grow, shifting across the grid like
evanescent neural impulses or bioluminescent clusters of diatoms. In Stephen Hawking’s
2012 film The Meaning of Life, the narrator describes Conway’s mathematical model as
simulating “how a complex thing like the mind might come about from a basic set of
rules,” revealing the overweening ambitions that characterize contemporary AI: “[T]hese
complex properties emerge from simple laws that contain no concepts like movement or
reproduction,” yet they produce “species,” and cells “can even reproduce, just as life does
in the real world.” °°

Just as life does? Artists know the blandishments of simulation and
representation, the difference between the genius of artifice and the realities of what “life

Everybody became a potential agent of implicating others. Dominos would fall. Targets
would flip.

Paul Manafort, making a good living in international financial gray areas, his risk
calculation based on the long-shot odds that an under-the-radar privateer would ever
receive close scrutiny, would now be subjected to microscopic review. His nemesis, Oleg
Deripaska—still pursuing his $17 million claim against Manafort and himself looking for
favorable treatment from federal authorities who had restricted his travel to the United
States—was continuing his own deep investigation into Manafort’s Russian and Ukrainian
business affairs.

Tom Barrack, privy to the president’s stream of consciousness as well as his financial
history, was suddenly taking stock of his own exposure. Indeed, all the billionaire friends
with whom Trump got on the phone and gossiped and rambled were potential witnesses.

In the past, administrations forced to deal with a special prosecutor appointed to
investigate and prosecute matters with which the president might have been involved
usually became consumed by the effort to cope. Their tenure broke into “before” and
“after” periods—with the “after” period hopelessly bogged down in the soap opera of G-
man pursuit. Now it looked like the “after” period would be almost the entirety of the
Trump administration.

The idea of formal collusion and artful conspiracy—as media and Democrats more or
less breathlessly believed or hoped had happened between Trump and the Russians—
seemed unlikely to everybody in the White House. (Bannon’s comment that the Trump
campaign was not organized enough to collude with its own state organizations became
everybody’s favorite talking point—not least because it was true.) But nobody was
vouching for the side deals and freelance operations and otherwise nothing-burger stuff
that was a prosecutor’s daily bread and the likely detritus of the Trump hangers-on. And
everybody believed that if the investigation moved into the long chain of Trump financial
transactions, it would almost certainly reach the Trump family and the Trump White
House.

And then there was the president’s insistent claim that he could do something. J can
fire him, he would say. Indeed, it was another of his repetitive loops: I can fire him. I can
fire him. Mueller. The idea of a showdown in which the stronger, more determined, more
intransigent, more damn-the-consequences man prevails was central to Trump’s own
personal mythology. He lived in a mano a mano world, one in which if your own
respectability and sense of personal dignity were not a paramount issue—if you weren’t
weak in the sense of needing to seem like a reasonable and respectable person—you had a
terrific advantage. And if you made it personal, if you believed that when the fight really
mattered that it was kill or be killed, you were unlikely to meet someone willing to make it
as personal as you were.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013871.txt,"A true account by AJ Jacobs, editor-at-large at Esquire magazine (ellipses represent passage of time
between entries)

IT BEGAN a month ago. I was midway through The World Is Flat, the bestseller by Tom Friedman. I
like Friedman, despite his puzzling decision to wear a mustache. His book is all about how outsourcing
to India and China is not just for tech support and carmakers but is poised to transform every industry in
America, from law to banking to accounting.

I don’t have a corporation; I don’t even have an up-to-date business card. I’m a writer and editor
working from home, usually in my boxer shorts or, if ’'m feeling formal, my penguin-themed pajama
bottoms. Then again, I think, why should Fortune 500 firms have all the fun? Why can’t I join in on the
biggest business trend of the new century? Why can’t I outsource my low-end tasks? Why can’t I
outsource my life?

The next day I e-mail Brickwork, one of the companies Friedman mentions in his book. Brickwork —
based in Bangalore, India—offers “remote executive assistants,” mostly to financial firms and healthcare
companies that want data processed. I explain that I'd like to hire someone to help with Esquire-related
tasks —doing research, formatting memos, like that. The company’s CEO, Vivek Kulkarni, responds, “It
would be a great pleasure to be talking to a person of your stature.” Already I’m liking this. ve never
had stature before. In America, I barely command respect from a Bennigan’s maitre d’, so it’s nice to
know that in India I have stature.

A couple of days later, I get an e-mail from my new “remote executive assistant.”

Dear Jacobs,

My name is Honey K. Balani. I would be assisting you in your editorial and personal job.... I
would try to adapt myself as per your requirements that would lead to desired satisfaction.

Desired satisfaction. This is great. Back when I worked at an office, I had assistants, but there was
never any talk of desired satisfaction. In fact, if anyone ever used the phrase “desired satisfaction,” we’d
all end up in a solemn meeting with HR.

I GO OUT to dinner with my friend Misha, who grew up in India, founded a software firm, and
subsequently became nauseatingly rich. I tell him about Operation Outsource. “You should call Your
Man in India,” he says. Misha explains that this is a company for Indian businessmen who have moved
overseas but who still have parents back in New Delhi or Mumbai. YMII is their overseas concierge
service—it buys movie tickets and cell phones and other sundries for abandoned moms.

Perfect. This could kick my outsourcing up to a new level. I can have a nice, clean division of labor:
Honey will take care of my business affairs, and YMII can attend to my personal life—pay my bills,
make vacation reservations, buy stuff online. Happily, YMII likes the idea, and just like that the support
team at Jacobs Inc. has doubled.

HONEY HAS completed her first project for me: research on the person Esquire has chosen as the
Sexiest Woman Alive. I’ve been assigned to write a profile of this woman, and I really don’t want to
have to slog through all the heavy-breathing fan websites about her. When I open Honey’s file, I have
this reaction: America is f*cked. There are charts. There are section headers. There is a well-organized

Article 6.

Foreign Affairs

How Fatah-Hamas Unity Threatens U.S.
Funding

Douglas N. Greenburg and Derek D. Smith

June 20, 2011 -- The reconciliation agreement signed in April
between Fatah and Hamas, which called for the creation of an interim
Palestinian unity government followed by elections later this year,
raises a number of difficult issues for the United States. Among these
is whether Washington can lawfully continue to provide aid to the
Palestinian Authority (PA) if it includes Hamas as an equal partner.
After all, existing U.S. law designates Hamas as a terrorist
organization and thus prevents the United States from aiding it in any
way. Although the unity pact suffered a setback when a planned
conference in Cairo on Tuesday to announce a new government was
postponed, negotations are ongoing. Should the two sides eventually
succeed in creating a unity government, continued U.S. funding for
the PA could be illegal. Despite this, given the PA’s dependence on
U.S. aid, Washington may decide that financially sustaining the
Palestinian leadership is vital to the peace process or other strategic
interests. As a result, it may attempt to continue aiding elements of
the PA that remain unaffiliated with Hamas. Yet absent specific
congressional authorization, such a strategy will face significant legal
obstacles.

U.S. law has long prohibited citizens from providing support to or
doing business with Hamas, which has been on the Treasury
Department’s designated terrorist list since 1995 and the State
Department’s list of designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations since
1997. Under the U.S. criminal code, individuals cannot knowingly

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030178
"
IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028737.txt,"That is out of the question. Egypt is too reliant on foreign finance, which
Iran cannot offer at the moment, for it to swing into Tehran's orbit. And
there is far too much domestic opposition.

What is clear is that while the US is reluctant to take direct responsibility,
other countries must find ways of resolving the regional contradictions
that have become unmanageable in the era of American tutelage. That will
lead to some unlikely meetings taking place. The Morsi-Ahmadinejad
embrace may not be a breakthrough, but it does show one thing: what was
unthinkable a few years ago may one day be the norm.

Article 4.

Al-Monitor
Hamas Weighs Options For Recognizing Israel
Adnan Abu Amer

February 8 -- Recently, a lot has been said — and a lot of denials have
been issued — about Hamas recognizing a two-state solution. It appears
that Hamas is still vacillating between explicitly and implicitly
recognizing Israel. Hamas realizes that recognizing Israel would open up
the world’s doors to the movement. At the same time, Hamas knows that
such a move would be seen as a betrayal by the movement’s supporters,
both inside and outside Palestine. As Hamas well knows, its legitimacy
derives from its vocal support for armed struggle within the complicated
Palestinian reality. Hamas also knows that it will pay a heavy price if it is
seen to be agreeing to international conditions. The cost will not only be
political, but also ideological. Hamas has spent many years talking and
writing about its notion of the state, its identity, borders, concept,
constitution and the role of Islam within it. Generations of Hamas
members were raised on those ideas. But those ideas have remained part

"
IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011560.txt,"was always the principle of targeted force, the idea that we would take out
targets, or defeat enemies, out of military necessity. But even on the first day of
the war, it was clear that it would be by far the most consequential conflict in
our country’s history. There was no mission for Sayeret Matkal, nor, it seemed,
any prospect of our playing any significant part.

The fact that my own role was slightly less peripheral was due to Avraham
Arnan. He phoned me almost as soon as we’d got news of the Israeli air victory,
and told me he had been told to take a few men from the sayeret across the
southern border. Our assignment was to complete our failed attempt to defuse
the booby-trap on the intercept in the Sinai. I quickly drafted in two others from
the unit. One was Danny Michaelson, a friend from Hebrew University, where
we had been lab partners. The other was Rafi Friedman, our paramedic, who
had been with me on several of our missions on the Golan.

Avraham arrived at the base around noon. I got a Jeep and we set off. We
crossed into Egypt around four o’clock in the afternoon and headed for the field
headquarters of Israel Tal. Known as Talik, he was the commander of Israel’s
armored corps, and Avraham knew him well. His wartime division consisted of
the country’s premier tank unit, the Seventh Armored Brigade, and a reserve
brigade. We accompanied them the next day to an abandoned Egyptian camp
not far from El Arish, in the northern Sinai. At least, we’d assumed it was
abandoned. As Talik and Avraham were talking in his command post, we heard a
sudden burst of gunfire, which seemed to come from just a few dozen yards
outside. As everyone inside the command post looked around, Avraham turned
to me and said: “Ehud, don’t you think we ought to deal with it?” Then, to
Talik: “Make sure none of your guys shoots him.”

I got Danny and Rafi. We made our way toward an underground bunker,
which seemed the most likely source of the gunfire. Hugging the wall as I led
the way down a series of concrete steps, I clicked off the safety on my Uzi just
in case. But with the main Egyptian forces in obvious retreat, I figured that
whoever was doing the shooting would have to be shellshocked, or insanely
brave, to put up a fight. There were eight men crouched inside, soldiers and
several staff officers cradling Kalashnikovs, and an Egyptian army general. In
what was obviously at least serviceable Arabic, I told them all to raise their
hands. I made a brief attempt to interrogate the general, but quickly reached the
limits of my linguistic proficiency. So we marched them away and handed them
over to Talik’s intelligence officers.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016820.txt,"I met Seth Lloyd in the late 1980s, when new ways of thinking were everywhere: the
importance of biological organizing principles, the computational view of mathematics
and physical processes, the emphasis on parallel networks, the importance of nonlinear
dynamics, the new understanding of chaos, connectionist ideas, neural networks, and
parallel distributive processing. The advances in computation during that period
provided us with a new way of thinking about knowledge.

Seth likes to refer to himself as a quantum mechanic. He is internationally known
jor his work in the field of quantum computation, which attempts to harness the exotic
properties of quantum theory, like superposition and entanglement, to solve problems
that would take several lifetimes to solve on classical computers.

In the essay that follows, he traces the history of information theory from Norbert
Wiener ’s prophetic insights to the predictions of a technological “singularity” that some
would have us believe will supplant the human species. His takeaway on the recent
programming method known as deep learning is to call for a more modest set of
expectations; he notes that despite AI’s enormous advances, robots “still can’t tie their
own shoes.”

It’s difficult for me to talk about Seth without referencing his relationship with his
friend and professor, the late theoretical physicist Heinz Pagels of Rockefeller
University. The graduate student and the professor each had a profound effect on each
other’s ideas.

In the summer of 1988, I visited Heinz and Seth at the Aspen Center for Physics.
Their joint work on the subject of complexity was featured in the current issue of
Scientific American; they were ebullient. That was just two weeks before Heinz’s tragic
death in a hiking accident while descending Pyramid Peak with Seth. They were talking
about quantum computing.

Comes as friends now fear that if Hillary Clinton runs for president in 2016, all of
their family's old scandals will be brought to the forefront
Epstein has a host of famous friends including Prince Andrew who stayed at his New
York mansion AFTER his arrest
By Daily Mail Reporter
Published: 09:06 EST, 19 March 2014 | Updated: 21:10 EST, 5 January 2015
A new lawsuit has revealed the extent of former President Clinton's friendship with a fundraiser who was
later jailed for having sex with an underage prostitute.
Bill Clinton's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, who served time in 2008 for his illegal sexual partners,
included up multiple trips to the onetime billionaire's private island in the Caribbean where underage girls
were allegedly kept as sex slaves.
The National Enquirer has released new details about the two men's friendship, which seems to have
ended abruptly around the time of Epstein's arrest.
Naming names: A lawsuit between Jeffrey Epstein (right, in 2011) and his legal team has
included multiple mentions about the convicted pedophile's connection to former
President Bill Clinton (left, earlier this month)
Pedophile paradise: The lawsuit included flight records that showed Clinton made multiple
trips to Epstein's private island, Little St James (pictured), between 2002 and 2005.
Women were reportedly kept there as sex slaves
Tales of orgies and young girls being shipped to the island, called Little St. James, have been revealed as
part of an ongoing lawsuit between Epstein and his former lawyers Scott Rothstein and Bradley Edwards.
It is unclear what the basis of the suit is, but they go on to call witness testimony from some of the
frequent guests at Epstein's island to talk about the wild parties that were held there in the early 2000s.
Flight logs pinpoint Clinton's trips on Epstein's jet
between the years 2002 and 2005, while he was working
on his philanthropic post-presidential career and while
his wife Hillary was a Senator for their adopted state of New York.
Convicted: Epstein was investigated in 2005 after a
woman reported that he paid her 14-year-old daughter for
sex
'I remember asking Jeffrey what's Bill Clinton doing here kind fo thing, and he laughed it off and said well
he owes me a favor,' one unidentified woman said in the lawsuit, which was filed in Palm Beach Circuit
Court.
The woman went on to say how orgies were a regular occurrence and she recalled two young girls from
New York who were always seen around the five-house compound but their personal backstories were
never revealed.
At least one woman on the compound was there unwillingly, as the suit identifies a woman as Jane Doe
102.
She 'was forced to live as one of Epstein's underage sex slaves for years and was forced to have sex with...
politicians, businessmen, royalty, academicians, etc,' the lawsuit says according to The Enquirer.
Epstein's sexual exploits have been documented since 2005, when a woman in Palm Beach contacted
police saying that her 14-year-old daughter had been paid $300 to massage him and then have sex.
The claim prompted a nearly year-long investigation that led to the eventual charge of soliciting
prostitution which came as part of a plea deal. He spent 13 months of a 18-month sentence in jail and
remains a registered sex offender.
Several of his famous friends cut ties- including Clinton and then-New York Governor Eliot Spitzer who
returned his campaign donations- but not all of them: Prince Andrew reportedly stayed at Epstein's
mansion in New York in 2010, months after he was released from jail.
Chelsea Clinton leaves hospital with new baby Charlotte
Keeping ties: Clinton was also friends with an unnamed woman who stored pictures of
underage girls for Epstein, and though Clinton cut ties with Epstein after his arrest, he
invited the woman to Chelsea's 2010 wedding
Clinton's connection to Epstein, who worked as a financier and education philanthropist before more than
40 women came forward with claims about him being a sexual predator, has been long-established, but
The Enquirer also tells how the former president was also friends with some of Epstein's seedy
acquaintances.
The lawsuit claims that Clinton was friends with an unnamed woman who 'kept images of naked underage
children on her computer, helped to recruit underage children for Epstein... and photographed underage
females in sexually explicit poses'.
While he cut off ties with Epstein, this woman's abuses apparently did not end their relationship as she
was reportedly one of the 400 guests at Chelsea Clinton's 2010 wedding.
Latest ladies: Clinton was pictured posing for a photo with Barbie Girl (left) and Ava Adora
(right), two known prostitutes who work at the Bunny Brothel in Nevada
Though the lawsuit may be bringing up sexual skeleton's from Clinton's past, he has added to the drama of
late by posing for a photo with two known prostitutes at a fundraiser in Los Angeles last month.
The drama of his extramarital affairs is apparently just one concern for Clinton family loyalists, as a Wall
Street Journal article released today details how
'I'm not in the political camp; I'm in the friends camp. And the friends camp definitely has concerns about
her running,' the former Secretary of State's friend Linda Bloodworth-Thomason told the paper,

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026831.txt,"A. Raw Land Investment. A qualifying foreign pension fund invests in a partnership that buys raw land
in the United States. (This could be a vacant lot, timberland, oil and gas or mineral property, or other
property interests that qualify for treatment as real property for federal income tax purposes.) The
investment is a capital asset, as the partnership is not engaged in business. The partnership later sells
the property to a developer, or the pension fund sells its partnership interest. Under prior law, the
foreign pension fund's non-business capital gain would automatically be subject to US federal income
tax because of FIRPTA. Under the new law, the foreign pension fund's long-term or short-term capital
gain is exempt from U.S. income tax and FIRPTA withholding because FIRPTA does not apply.

B. Equity Kicker Mortgage Loan Investment. A foreign pension fund acquires an ownership interest
in a mortgage loan secured by U.S. real property. The loan includes stated interest plus an equity
kicker (e.g., additional interest equal to a share of gain realized on sale of the property). Such an
equity kicker loan is treated as a U.S. real property interest under FIRPTA. Under prior law, gain
realized by the foreign pension fund upon sale of the loan would automatically be subject to U.S.
income tax under FIRPTA. Under new law, the gain realized on the sale of the mortgage loan would
be exempt from U.S. income tax. (This conclusion is based on the assumption that the foreign pension
fund is a mere investor and not engaged in an active lending business in the U.S.)

C. U.S. Blocker Corp. Investment. A foreign pension fund wants to make an equity investment in a
U.S. real estate business that is organized as a partnership. The foreign pension fund forms a U.S.
corporation to acquire the partnership interest and the corporation is capitalized with a mix of equity
and debt held by the shareholder. The corporation is subject to U.S. income tax on its net income, but
gets to deduct interest paid or accrued on the debt held by the shareholder. The foreign corporation
later sells the stock of the corporation. Under prior law, the gain on sale of the stock would be subject
to U.S. income tax because the corporation was a U.S. real property holding corporation under
FIRPTA. Under new law, FIRPTA does not apply to the foreign pension fund, so the capital gain on sale
of the stock is exempt from U.S. income tax. Note that the U.S.-source interest paid to the foreign
shareholder could be subject to U.S. withholding tax under the regular rules of the Code, but if the
pension fund is organized in a jurisdiction that has a tax treaty with the U.S. (e.g., UK, Germany,
France, China, Japan, etc.), these interest payments could be exempt from U.S. withholding under such
tax treaty.

2. FIRPTA EXEMPTION FOR INVESTMENTS IN PUBLICLY TRADED REIT STOCK INCREASED FROM 5
PERCENT to 10 PERCENT

For publicly traded REITs, the PATH Act opens the door to increased investment by expanding the
current statutory exemption from FIRPTA for small portfolio investments by non-U.S. persons. The Act
provides all foreign investors (not just pension funds) can now own up to 10 percent of the stock of a
publicly traded REIT without triggering FIRPTA tax. Under prior law, FIRPTA tax would apply upon the
foreign investor's sale of stock of the publicly traded REIT or the receipt of certain distributions from
such REIT if the foreign investor holds more than 5 percent of the REIT's stock.

3. CLARIFICATION OF THE EXEMPTION FOR INVESTMENTS IN DOMESTICALLY CONTROLLED REITS
The PATH Act includes important clarifying presumptions that will allow publicly traded REITs and their
shareholders to rely with greater confidence on the current law FIRPTA exemption for gains realized
on sales of stock in domestically controlled REITS. In determining whether a REIT is domestically
controlled, the REIT is now permitted to presume that any owner of less than 5 percent of any publicly

traded shares of the REIT is a U.S. person, unless the REIT has actual knowledge to the contrary.

their existence in order to achieve those objectives may be insuperable.

1001 Reasons to Pay No Attention

Objections have been raised to these arguments, primarily by researchers within the AI
community. The objections reflect a natural defensive reaction, coupled perhaps with a
lack of imagination about what a superintelligent machine could do. None hold water on
closer examination. Here are some of the more common ones:

e Don’t worry, we can just switch it off? This is often the first thing that pops into a
layperson’s head when considering risks from superintelligent Al—as if a
superintelligent entity would never think of that. This is rather like saying that the
risk of losing to DeepBlue or AlphaGo is negligible—all one has to do is make
the right moves.

e Human-level or superhuman AI is impossible This is an unusual claim for AI
researchers to make, given that, from Turing onward, they have been fending off
such claims from philosophers and mathematicians. The claim, which is backed
by no evidence, appears to concede that if superintelligent AI were possible, it
would be a significant risk. It’s as if a bus driver, with all of humanity as
passengers, said, “Yes, I am driving toward a cliff—in fact, I’m pressing the pedal
to the metal! But trust me, we’ll run out of gas before we get there!” The claim
represents a foolhardy bet against human ingenuity. We have made such bets
before and lost. On September 11, 1933, renowned physicist Ernest Rutherford
stated, with utter confidence, “Anyone who expects a source of power from the
transformation of these atoms is talking moonshine.” On September 12, 1933,
Leo Szilard invented the neutron-induced nuclear chain reaction. A few years
later he demonstrated such a reaction in his laboratory at Columbia University.
As he recalled in a memoir: “We switched everything off and went home. That
night, there was very little doubt in my mind that the world was headed for grief.”

e It’s too soon to worry about it. The right time to worry about a potentially serious
problem for humanity depends not just on when the problem will occur but also
on how much time is needed to devise and implement a solution that avoids the
risk. For example, if we were to detect a large asteroid predicted to collide with
the Earth in 2067, would we say, “It’s too soon to worry”? And if we consider
the global catastrophic risks from climate change predicted to occur later in this
century, is it too soon to take action to prevent them? On the contrary, it may be
too late. The relevant timescale for human-level AI is less predictable, but, like
nuclear fission, it might arrive considerably sooner than expected. One variation
on this argument is Andrew Ng’s statement that it’s “like worrying about
overpopulation on Mars.” This appeals to a convenient analogy: Not only is the

? AI researcher Jeff Hawkins, for example, writes, “Some intelligent machines will be virtual, meaning they
will exist and act solely within computer networks. .. . It is always possible to turn off a computer network,
even if painful.” https:/Avww.recode.net/2015/3/2/11559576/.

really in a state of decline because of
corruption and charges of embezzlement.
It's got an aging leadership. There's no
dynamism left in the group. There's a lot of
factionalism. It's almost like an oligarchy.

Rawabi could be Qatar's way of

their money behind a political
establishment that they don't fully trust.
On one end they need to make sure Fatah
does not completely collapse or weaken to
the point where they're no longer coherent,
says Bokhari, and Hamas needs to be
shaped and contained and shepherded in a
way that it doesn't grow into anything

Though there are politics underlying
Qatar's investment in Rawabi, it is still,
inevitably, a financial decision. You have

of course she would have come with me. She felt angry with herself, and with
me too, for not simply having phoned. But since I didn’t contact her in the
weeks that followed, she figured this was just another one of our times apart. Or
“stupid pride”. A few months later, I heard she was engaged to be married, to a
young man she’d known since their high school days at the Alliance.

I had first met Nava Cohen, the woman I would go on to marry, the previous
year. It was through another Cohen, though they were not related: Nechemia,
my sayeret friend who was killed in the 1967 war. He invited me to Tel Aviv
for a party in the spring, on the Jewish holiday of Purim, and introduced us.
Nava was just nineteen, five years younger than me. I was struck not just by the
fact she was attractive, but by her poise, warm-heartedness, and her obvious
intelligence. But she had her boyfriend with her, and I still saw myself and Nili
as life partners. Now, she was beginning her studies at Hebrew University as
well, and, in a way, it was again Nechemia

Cohen who brought us together. Since his death, those of us who knew him
from the sayeret had been looking for a fitting way to remember and to honor
him. We finally decided to set up a living memorial in his name: a Moadon
Sayarim, a center to train young people from all over Jerusalem in scouting and
navigation. We spent six months getting it up and running, and Nava pitched in
with the work.

It wasn’t until a few months after I heard of Nili’s engagement that I finally
asked her on a date. We were in the university library, which had a space where
you could listen to tapes through headphones. I would go to hear classical
music. Nava was studying English literature, and I’d sometimes see her there,
engrossed in recordings of Shakespeare with the text of Hamlet or Macbeth in
front of her. Since I wasn’t shackled by the need to follow the alacks and
alasses, I read the newspaper as the music washed over me. I turned to the
movie section. I circled three films, drew a question mark in the margin and
passed it to her. She looked puzzled for a second. Then she smiled and put a
checkmark next to one of them.

While we came from different backgrounds, the gap was narrower than it
had been with Nili. Her parental home was in Tiberias. Her parents were from
old Sephardi families, with a centuries-long history in Palestine, and were also
solid Ben-Gurion Labor supporters. Her father had fought in the British army in
the Second World War. He now ran the branch of Bank Leumi in Tiberias. Her
mother ran a shop in what was then the city’s best hotel, the Ginton.

MIKA WHO?

he media had unlocked the value of Donald Trump, but few in the media had
“TP unlocked it more directly and personally than Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski.
Their MSNBC breakfast show was an ongoing soap-opera-ish or possibly Oprahesque
drama about their relationship with Trump—how he had disappointed them, how far they
had come from their original regard for him, and how much and how pathetically he
regularly embarrassed himself. The bond he once had with them, forged through mutual
celebrity and a shared proprietary sense of politics (Scarborough, the former congressman,
seemed to feel that he ought reasonably to be president as much as Donald Trump felt he
should be), had distinguished the show during the campaign; now its public fraying
became part of the daily news cycle. Scarborough and Brzezinski lectured him, channeled
the concerns of his friends and family, upbraided him, and openly worried about him—
that he was getting the wrong advice (Bannon) and, too, that his mental powers were
slipping. They also staked a claim at representing the reasonable center-right alternative to
the president, and indeed were quite a good barometer of both the center-right’s efforts to
deal with him and its day-to-day difficulties of living with him.

Trump, believing he had been used and abused by Scarborough and Brzezinski,
claimed he’d stopped watching the show. But Hope Hicks, every morning, quaking, had to
recount it for him.

Morning Joe was a ground-zero study in the way the media had over-invested in
Trump. He was the whale against which media emotions, self-regard, ego, joie de guerre,
career advancement, and desire to be at the center of the story, too, all churned in nearly
ecstatic obsession. In reverse regard, the media was the same whale, serving the same
function, for Trump.

To this Trump added another tic, a lifelong sense that people were constantly taking
unfair advantage of him. This perhaps came from his father’s cheapness and lack of
generosity, or from his own overawareness of being a rich kid (and, no doubt, his
insecurities about this), or from a negotiator’s profound understanding that it is never win-
win, that where there is profit there is loss. Trump simply could not abide the knowledge

° If meetings are unavoidable, keep the following in mind:
e » Go in with a clear set of objectives.

e > Set an end time or leave early.

2. Batch activities to limit setup cost and provide more time for dreamline milestones.

What can I routinize by batching? That is, what tasks (whether laundry, groceries, mail, payments, or
sales reporting, for example) can I allot to a specific time each day, week, month, quarter, or year so that
I don’t squander time repeating them more often than is absolutely necessary ?

3. Set or request autonomous rules and guidelines with occasional review of results.

Eliminate the decision bottleneck for all things that are nonfatal if misperformed. If an employee, believe
in yourself enough to ask for more independence on a trial basis. Have practical “rules” prepared and ask
the boss for the sale after surprising him or her with an impromptu presentation. Remember the Puppy
Dog Close—make it a one-time trial and reversible.

For the entrepreneur or manager, give others the chance to prove themselves. The likelihood of
irreversible or expensive problems is minimal and the time savings are guaranteed. Remember, profit is
only profitable to the extent that you can use it. For that you need time.

Eliminating Paper Distractions, Capturing Everything

» Evernote ( www.evernote.com )

This is perhaps the most impressive tool I’ve found in the last year, introduced to me by some of the
most productive technologists in the world. Evernote has eliminated more than 90% of the paper in my
life and eliminated nearly all of the multiple tabs I used to leave open in web browsers, both of which
distracted me to no end. It can clear out your entire office clutter in one to three hours.

Evernote allows you to easily capture information from anywhere using whatever device is at hand,
and everything is then searchable (read: findable) from anywhere. I use it to:

e » Take photographs of everything I might want to remember or find
later—business cards, handwritten notes, wine labels, receipts,
whiteboard sessions, and more. Evernote identifies the text in all
of these pictures automatically, so it’s all searchable(!), whether
from an iPhone, your laptop, or the web. Just as one example, I
can store and find the contact information from any business card
in seconds (often using the built in iSight camera on Mac to

contributions fall within one of the categories prescribed in the Quaran ....” See infra p. 98-99; JA1068-73, 2483. Moreover,
by advertising these accounts, Al Rajhi Bank “provid[ed] a mechanism to allow al Qaida’s supporters to deposit funds
directly into those accounts.” JA3828.

Al Rajhi Bank’s operations are consistent with their support of al-Qaeda front charities. In 1999, Al Rajhi Bank was warned.
by United States government officials “that their financial systems were being manipulated or utilized to fund terrorist
organizations such as Al Qaeda.” SPA5S5 (Terrorist Attacks I; JA 2584-86; infra pp. 93-95. “Despite these warnings, Al
Rajhi failed to adopt even the most minimal standards, [which] resulted in the use of Al Rajhi as an instrument of terror ...”
SPAS55 (Terrorist Attacks J). By ignoring the most basic banking standards “designed to thwart the support of terrorist
networks,” such as “anti-terrorist money laundering safeguards and ‘know your customer’ regulations,” Al Rajhi Bank
willfully turned a blind eye towards the true nature of these charities. JA2483.

*81 (b) Saudi American Bank

Plaintiffs’ complaints allege that Saudi American Bank has knowingly provided various forms of material support to
al-Qaeda. For example, “Saudi American Bank knowingly provided material support and resources to al Qaida” by “finance
[ing] many of the projects undertaken by Osama bin Laden and al Qaida in the Sudan during the years that the al Qaida
leadership structure operated from that country ....” JA843-44, 3843. This included projects such as “the construction of
major roads and the Port of Sudan airport.” JA3843.

Saudi American Bank is also alleged to have “knowingly provided financial services and other forms of material support to al
Qaida.” JA3844. It did this by “maintain[ing] accounts for many of the ostensible charities that operate within al Qaida’s
infrastructure, including MWL, WAMY, IRO and al Haramain” with “know[ledge] that [these] accounts ... were being used
to solicit and transfer funds to terrorist organizations, including al *82 Qaida.” JA843-44, 3843-44. “Saudi American Bank
also serve[d] as the Saudi Arabia correspondent for many other banks within at Qaida’s infrastructure ....” JA843-44, 3844.

Plaintiffs further allege that “Saudi American Bank facilit[ated] al Qaida’s fundraising efforts” by “advertis[ing] the existence
and numerical designation of the accounts it maintain[ed] for those charities throughout the Muslim world, and provid[ing] a
mechanism to allow al Qaida supporters to deposit funds directly into those accounts.” JA3844. These actions were alleged to
have been done “[i]n cooperation with the charities operating within al Qaida’s infrastructure ....” JA3844. Also, plaintiffs
allege that in “2000, the Saudi American Bank participated in the fund raising campaign in Saudi Arabia for collecting
donations to the ‘heroes of the Al Quds uprising’ (Intifada) by providing a bank account and facilities to receive donations for
a committee of charity organizations including [WAMY], [IIRO,] and al Haramain Foundation.” JA844. In addition,
plaintiffs allege that “from 1996 through 2001, the Saudi American Bank funneled money to and/or from the Spanish al
Qaida cell.” JA4385.

*83 (c) Saleh Abdullah Kamel and Dallah al Baraka

Plaintiffs’ complaints allege that Saleh Abdullah Kamel, a Saudi businessman, has knowingly provided extensive material
support to al-Qaeda, both individually and through his various business entities, including Dallah al Baraka. JA3869-70. For
example, the complaints allege that Kamel personally “has made substantial contributions to many of the charities operating
within al Qaeda’s infrastructure, with full knowledge that those funds would be used to support al Qaida’s operations and
terrorist attacks.” JA3869-70. He is also alleged to have “long provided financial support and other forms of material support
to terrorist organizations,” such as al-Qaeda. JA3162. Kamel’s role as a key financial supporter of al Qaeda’s is confirmed by
his inclusion on the Golden Chain. JA3164; see infra pp. 109-10. One such contribution is alleged to have occurred in 1992,
when Kamel donated $100,000 to Sanabil Al-Khair, the North American financial arm of the TRO. JA3125. In addition,
complaints allege that through personal investments, Kamel has provided financial support to publicly identified terrorist
organizations, including by means of zakat donations requiring Kamel’s authorization. JA3173-74, 3193, 3200, 3869-70.

*84 The complaints further allege that “Kamel financed and developed Dallah al Baraka and its subsidiaries to operate as
profitable banking and investment institutions and to serve as financial vehicles for transferring millions of dollars to Islamic

militants around the world.” JA3162, 3869-70. In fact, plaintiffs allege that “[t]he practice and policy of Dallah Albaraka ...

of Communist oppression.

Angela Davis remains the best proof that in America, as distinguished from the countries she so
admires, it is possible for a Black, Communist woman to receive a fair trial. The key, of course, is
for the trial to have the kind of high visibility and media attention hers received. There are still far
too many obscure defendants, of all races, who do not receive fair trials or fair sentences. The

was a breakdown in communication. Of course, this may be a purely
personal failing, but when I talk to people in other companies they
report the same problem. It seems we all find communication difficult.

have wondered for many years why it is called the ‘art of
communication. Surely it’s a science, governed by bits, bytes and
bandwidth. That might be true of the symbols in an email — they are
clearly encoded symbolically — but is the understanding in our brains
simply encoded by symbols? What is the physics that underlies human
understanding?

Each summer I go on holiday to escape engineering for a couple of
weeks. While away I indulge my passion for reading books by the likes
of Douglas Hofstadter, David Deutsch and Stephen Hawking. One book
that struck me years ago was Roger Penrose’s The Emperors New Mind.
In it, he tackles the question of what happens in the human brain when
we understand something. He extends an idea put forward by J.R. Lucas
of Oxford University that minds must be more powerful than computers
because they do something computers cannot: namely to step beyond
mere rules and see truth. Colloquially we call this ‘common sense’ or
‘stepping outside the box’

The Lucas argument uses the theories of Gédel and Turing to
show computer algorithms have limitations. Some things are simply
not computable. Computers can do many useful things, but they cannot
discover new mathematical theorems, such as a proof of Fermat’s Last
Theorem. In 1996, Andrew Wiles succeeded in finding a solution to this
problem. This presents a paradox, solved only if we conclude Andrew
Wiles is not a computer. Indeed, since most mathematicians discover at
least one theorem during their lives, we must conclude no mathematician
is a computer! This is controversial. Most philosophers tend to the
view put forward by Daniel Dennett that the Universe is an entirely
determined place and any personal sense of free will and creativity is
an illusion. In Dennett’s worldview, Andrew Wiles is a special purpose
machine that was always destined to solve Fermat’s Last Theorem. I
believe this model is flawed. It is my aim in this book to show you why.
Indeed I am going to go further and argue all human creativity is non-
computational; art, communication, understanding - all are based on
non-algorithmic principles.

If you consider creative thinking deeply enough you're inevitably
drawn into the question of whether we have free will. When I get to
work each morning, the first thing I do — after a cup of coffee, obviously
— is choose which creative task to tackle first. I feel this choice is freely
made, but the determined determinists assure me I am wrong and my

What did the people around Trump actually think of Trump? This was not just a
reasonable question, it was the question those around Trump most asked themselves. They
constantly struggled to figure out what they themselves actually thought and what they
thought everybody else was truly thinking.

Mostly they kept their answers to themselves, but in the instance of Comey and
Mueller, beyond all the usual dodging and weaving rationalizations, there really wasn’t
anybody, other than the president’s family, who didn’t very pointedly blame Trump
himself.

This was the point at which an emperors-new-clothes threshold was crossed. Now you
could, out loud, rather freely doubt his judgment, acumen, and, most of all, the advice he
was getting.

“He’s not only crazy,” declared Tom Barrack to a friend, “he’s stupid.”

But Bannon, along with Priebus, had strongly opposed the Comey firing, while Ivanka
and Jared had not only supported it, but insisted on it. This seismic event prompted a new
theme from Bannon, repeated by him widely, which was that every piece of advice from
the couple was bad advice.

Nobody now believed that firing Comey was a good idea; even the president seemed
sheepish. Hence, Bannon saw his new role as saving Trump—and Trump would always
need saving. He might be a brilliant actor but he could not manage his own career.

And for Bannon, this new challenge brought a clear benefit: when Trump’s fortune
sank, Bannon’s rose.

On the trip to the Middle East, Bannon went to work. He became focused on the figure
of Lanny Davis, one of the Clinton impeachment lawyers who, for the better part of two
years, became a near round-the-clock spokesperson and public defender of the Clinton
White House. Bannon judged Comey-Mueller to be as threatening to the Trump White
House as Monica Lewinsky and Ken Starr were to the Clinton White House, and he saw
the model for escaping a mortal fate in the Clinton response.

“What the Clintons did was to go to the mattresses with amazing discipline,” he
explained. “They set up an outside shop and then Bill and Hillary never mentioned it
again. They ground through it. Starr had them dead to rights and they got through it.”

Bannon knew exactly what needed to be done: seal off the West Wing and build a
separate legal and communications staff to defend the president. In this construct, the
president would occupy a parallel reality, removed from and uninvolved with what would
become an obvious partisan blood sport—as it had in the Clinton model. Politics would be
relegated to its nasty corner, and Trump would conduct himself as the president and as the
commander in chief.

motion graphed along , y= = x and = co-localize the circular orbit as it speeds

up and slows down while it bobs up and down. The transition from a fixed point (the
mass at rest) to a circle (the bobbing mass), a bifurcation in phase space, results in
the loss of topological equivalence. That is, the phase space geometries before and
after the bifurcation cannot be smoothly distorted into each other. Continuity and
connectedness of the space is lost. For topological equivalence, stretching, bending
and warping are allowed but not tearing apart and/or gluing together. Following the
bifurcation of a fixed point into a circle, even limitless shrinking of the ring leaves a
hole. The appearance or disappearance of an equilibrium fixed point (called a
“saddle-node” bifurcation), splitting into two (“period doubling” bifurcation), its
exploding into a circle (“Hopf’ bifurcation to a limit cycle), a circle splitting into two or
more incommensurate cycles (“secondary Hopf’ bifurcation) and these multiperiodic
(“quasiperiodic”) dynamics breaking down into a recursive spirals (“homoclinic
bifurcation to chaos”) are among the common bifurcations in nonlinear dynamical

systems, and all of them have been observed in many neurobiological settings.

In the forced-dissipative (energetically driven and energy consuming)
dynamical systems relevant to the neurosciences---this characteristic contrasts with
the dissipation free momentum of the classical mechanics of astrophysical bodies---

period lengths 1>2—>4-—8->16...called the subharmonic or “period doubling route”;
(2) The transformation of fixed points to one and then more periodic orbits, multiple
independent (nonharmonic, incommensurate) frequency oscillations, their mode
lockings and then breakdown called the “quasiperiodic route”; (3) Fixed point or

Now, a very clever or annoying student asks, “What happens if an
infinite number of infinitely large buses arrive at the hotel. Can they all
fit in?” The mathematical question is “does infinity times infinity, equal
infinity?” Let us ask all the guests to get out of the bus and line up in the
parking lot in neat rows. Passengers from bus one in line 1, those from
bus 2 in line 2, and so on. All the guests now form a two-dimensional
grid. We already know how to map a two-dimensional grid to one-
dimension using the zigzag method. We can fit them all in the hotel and
we are done!

Is Anything Larger than Infinity?
Is there any bus or combination of buses that would cause the manager
of Hilbert’s Hotel a problem.

The answer is yes and it involves a subtle change to the contents of
the bus.

An infinite number of buses turn up but this time the buses are
filled with men and women. The hotel manager is asked to put everyone
in a room and once again he obliges using the zigzag method.

At the end of the process the tour guide comes to him. “I think you
have missed some people,’ he says. “Since I am just one person, I know
you can fit me in. But, I have a whole bus in the car park you completely
missed.”

“No,” says the manager. “I did every bus.”

to the changing economic and technological landscape.”” Specifically, the initiative aimed
to “build higher fences” around a core set of items whose misuse can pose a national security
threat to the United States.**

The reform initiative is synchronizing the two existing control lists, the Munitions List and
the Commerce Control List, so that they are “tiered” to distinguish the types of items that
should be subject to stricter or more permissive levels of control for different destinations,
end uses, and end users; create a “bright line” between the two current control lists to clarify
which list an item is controlled on, and reduce government and industry uncertainty about
whether particular items are subject to the control of the State Department or the Commerce
Department; and are structurally aligned so that they potentially can be combined into a
single list of controlled items.**

Moreover, the lists will be transformed into a “positive list” that describes controlled items
using objective criteria (e.g., technical parameters such as horsepower or microns) rather
than broad, open-ended, subjective, generic, or design intent-based criteria.* After applying
these criteria, the list will be divided into three tiers based on their military importance and
availability.*°

On the one hand, these reforms could greatly improve the efficiency of the export control
bureaucracy, preventing fewer technologies from slipping between the cracks and finding
their way to China. They could also make the system and its control lists better able to keep
pace with technological change, which had been a major problem with the old system,
particularly with regard to fast-moving information technologies. On the other hand, the
reforms appear to loosen controls over dual-use technologies, which China has a long and
successful track record of integrating into advanced systems, and which can form the core
of new innovations. The future of these reforms is unclear as the Trump administration
appears to focus on more aggressive trade strategies and policies designed to protect US
industries and punish offending Chinese companies.

Strong investment reviews

The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is an interagency
committee that serves the president in overseeing the national security implications of
foreign investment in the economy.*’ As China’s economy and financial weight has grown,
CFIUS has reviewed an increasing number of proposed acquisitions of American companies
and infrastructure by Chinese entities. Many of these proposed mergers have received
high levels of media and congressional attention, and most of the high-profile cases have
ended in rejection or strong discouragement leading to abandonment of the deal. While
the CFIUS process may have prevented individual cases of sensitive or illegal technology
transfer, it could also have had the unintended effect of forcing Chinese actors to steal the
data through espionage because of their inability to buy them. Recent legislation, signed by

eyewitness, photographs and flight details of Epstein’s private jets.

One picture, said to have been taken by Epstein during Andrew’s first encounter with the girl in March
2001 and published today by The Mail on Sunday, shows the Prince with his arm around her waist.

This is not the first time the Duke of York’s judgment and choice of associates have been questioned. He
appears to relish the company of super-rich oil billionaires from the Middle East, North Africa and the
former Soviet Union.

The peculiar sale of his former marital home to a Kazakh businessman for £15 million after it had
languished unsold for five years at £12 million has never been satisfactorily explained.

In the recent leak of American diplomatic cables it was revealed that he had criticised an official
corruption investigation into the huge Al-Yamamah arms deal between Britain and Saudi Arabia, while he
is also said to be close to Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi, son of the beleaguered Libyan president, and may have
had a role in the early release of Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Al Megrahi.

While on the streets, | slept with men for money. |
was a paedophile's dream

But it is Andrew’s friendship with Epstein, whom he has known since at least 2000, and with Epstein’s
confidante Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late disgraced newspaper baron Robert Maxwell, that
gives most concern.

He was first seen with the pair on holiday in Thailand, and was pictured cavorting with Ghislaine at a
Halloween fetishthemed party in Manhattan.

The photograph that appeared last weekend shows the prince strolling through Central Park with 58-
year-old Epstein. Andrew was said to have spent four days at his New York mansion in December, when
he was joined by other distinguished guests, including Woody Allen, at a dinner.

It is by no means the first New York soiree Andrew has attended as Epstein’s guest.

A lengthy profile of the financier in Vanity Fair magazine some years ago reported that Andrew was a
guest at a cocktail party thrown by Epstein and Maxwell packed with young Russian models. ‘Some
guests were horrified,’ said the article’s author, Vicky Ward.

It should not be forgotten that Epstein is a registered sex offender after recently completing his sentence
for offences relating to child prostitution.

However, he avoided trial on more serious charges that carried a potential life sentence. And no one
reading The Mail on Sunday’s interview with the woman who was prepared to testify against him can be
in any doubt of the seriousness of the charges.

Epstein, a Wall Street money manager who once counted Bill Clinton and Donald Trump among his
friends, became the subject of an undercover investigation in 2005 after the stepmother of a 14-year old
girl claimed she was paid $200 (£125) to give him an ‘erotic massage’.

The subsequent FBI probe uncovered at least 20 girls levelling sexual allegations against him.

Eventually, Epstein struck a ‘plea bargain’ with prosecutors — a practice not permitted under British law —
under which he was allowed to plead guilty to two relatively minor charges.

Healthcare Reauthorization Priorities. The Children’s
Health Insurance Plan (CHIP) will expire and needs to be
reauthorized in 2017. CHIP is a federal and state
partnership program which provides health coverage to
an estimated 8.9 millionlow-income children. In 2015,
President Obama signed the Medicare Access and CHIP
Reauthorization Act which extended CHIP for an
additional two years; without an extension of the program
in 2017 the program will exhaust its funding and states
will be required to continue the children’s coverage
through Medicaid until 2019, due to the ACA’s
maintenance of effort (MOE) provision unless the ACA is
repealed. The reauthorization process will create an
opportunity to consider additional policy changes
including changes to the CHIP and Medicaid programs.

The ACA also created a funding stream for community
health centers. In 2015, a bipartisan vote in Congress
extended the Community Health Center Fund by an
additional two years (FY 2016 and FY 2017). It is likely
that lawmakers will push to extend funding of community
health centers into future years beyond 2017.

Chronic Care. In late October, Senate Finance Committee
Chairman Hatch and Ranking Member Wyden along with
Senators Johnny lsakson (R-GA) and Mark Warner (D-VA),
co-chairs of the Finance Committee Chronic Care Working
Group, released a discussion draft with proposals to
improve health outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries living
with chronic conditions. Potential Senate legislative
action on the discussion draft is possible in the lame duck
session, but it is also possible the bill will be taken up in
the next Congress.

A Senate version (S. 2680) prompted Democratic
concerns over funding levels, privacy issues, and other
matters. Thisissueis one that could slip into the next
Congress if negotiators are unable to reach an agreement
given the limited time available.

Another outstanding year-end issue for Congressional
leaders is whether to address the pending Medicare Part-
B premium increases facing new and some existing
Medicare enrollees caused by a smaller annual Social
Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). Congress has
acted in the past to avert premium increases due to
modest COLA adjustments before the premium increases
take effect. Additional Medicare changes that are
bipartisan in nature could be added to this Part B
adjustment if leaders agree to move forward. Up for
potential consideration are a handful of Medicare-related
bills that have already passed the House or Senatein the
114‘ Congress, as well as a package of provisions
recently unveiled by the Finance Committee that would
address how chronic conditions are managed in the
Medicare population.

Additionally, Congress continuesto contemplate action in
the lame duck session to address the Obama
Administration’s proposal to modify the payment
mechanisms for Part B Medicare drugs. While the
proposal has not yet been finalized, concerns about the
size and scope of the proposal have been raised by
Congress.

Energy. House and Senate conferees also hope to finish
negotiating the final version of the bipartisan, omnibus
Energy Policy Modernization Act (S. 2012, H.R. 8).
Among many other provisions, that bill would give the
Energy Department emergency authority to protect the
electric power grid from physical and cyber threats;
require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) to expedite consideration of pipeline siting
applications; ease procedures for mining certain minerals
on federal lands; increase water allocationsto address
drought in California; and change forestry management.

There will also be a push to complete the Water Resources
Development Act (WRDA). In September, both the Senate
(S. 2848) and House (H.R. 5303) overwhelmingly passed
bills that need to be reconciled, but the two chambers
have not yet formally gone to conference. One factor that
is likely to expedite a conference and floor votes is the fact
that in September, in order to resolve a deadlock over
government funding, Speaker Ryan made a commitment
to move assistance to Flint, Michigan (which has faced a
drinking-water crisis) as part of the WRDA bill.

Energy measures could also come up as Republican
“riders” on a year-end spending bill, such as provisions
blocking the EPA’s Clean Power Plan or the “Waters of the
U.S.” wetlands rule. House Majority Leader McCarthy has
also said the House will consider a bill offering a tax credit
for new nuclear reactors.

Financial Services. House Financial Services Chairman
Jeb Hensarling (R-TX) has said he hopes for a lame-duck
floor vote on his CHOICE Act, which would repeal much of
the Dodd-Frank Act and replace it with a system in which
banks would become exempt from many prudential rules if
they agree to a much higher leverage ratio. The committee
passed the CHOICE Act ona party-line vote in September.
The Wells Fargo scandal could pose a hurdle for that plan,
because Hensarling’s bill would repeal the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) new rules limiting the
use of mandatory arbitration clauses in bank contracts.
Wells Fargo has been criticized for requiring its account
holders to agree to such clauses, restricting their ability to
sue the bank after as many as 2 million unauthorized
accounts were discovered.

The Financial Services Committee will hold a second
hearing on November 30 on the Wells Fargo issue, with
CFPB Director Richard Cordray testifying. SEC Chairman
Mary Jo White will also testifyon November 15.

Dear Jeffrey, 
May I drop by before the New Year (perhaps on the 9th, or on the 17th or 18th?) to get your advice 
about my renewal of the Templeton campaign, and also my needs in the coming year for Poetry in 
America? Below is the letter I'm sending out to my friends and supporters, and at the bottom a 
message just for you.... 
-Lisa 
That you are receiving this letter means that you are among a special community of friends whose 
support— financial, moral, intellectual, logistical— has allowed my initiative, Poetry in America, to 
realize what seemed, a year ago, almost certainly too ambitious a vision. That vision was to 
produce the highest quality educational video on American poetry, creating a body of 
humanities content capable of reaching a broad community of learners: formal and informal, 
online and residential, young and old, American and international. And it was to 
begin— rapidly— to disseminate and distribute our work. 
Whether you donated to Poetry in America through Filmmaker's Collaborative (our 501c3 fiscal 
sponsor), through Harvard, or through WGBH; whether you appeared on camera or talked an 
elusive friend into appearing on camera to discuss a poem; whether you lent us your film crew, or 
provided overnight use of your hotel suite or apartment or of your whole skyscraper; whether you 
highlighted our work on your stage, or talked your colleagues into becoming corporate sponsors; 
whether you flew to Boston to install state-of-the-art editing and video storage equipment, or asked 
your children's school to let us film there; whether you encouraged your family foundation to take an 
interest in the project, or gave us a lesson in IP, in licensing, in the rudiments of finance, or of 
distribution; whether you praised, or gave timely, much-needed criticism— you enabled what we 
have done. 
Here's what we have to report, and to show, a year later, thanks to your help. Links offer sneak 
peeks of works -in-progress across the full portfolio of Poetry in America projects. 
• The first eight-episode season of the public television series Poetry in America (a co-
production between WGBH, Emmy Award-winning filmmaker David Grubin, and my own new 
production company, Verse Video), is now fully funded and in production, with episodes featuring  
Bill Clinton, Herbie Hancock and Sonia Sanchez on Langston Hughes, Frank Gehry on Carl 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028946 
Sandburg, Katie Couric on Elizabeth Bishop, Nas on Whitman, and many more scheduled for 
nationwide launch in 2017. 
• Poetry in America's many initiatives to reach Middle and High School teachers and their 
! I students are taking root. Our first online course for Middle and High School Teachers, Poetry of 
the City, will launch this Spring with the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Companion 
materials to this course will be made available for free on PBS LearningMedia. This course is 
designed to meet the needs of English Language Arts and Social Studies teachers in the US and 
internationally. 
• We are eager to begin production of The Poetry of Earth, Sea, and Sky. Designed, too, for 
Middle and High School teachers, The Poetry of Earth, Sea, and Sky will draw English Language 
Arts instruction into dialogue with science, and will include extraordinary footage of the natural  
world, conversations with poets, scholars, and scientists as well as footage shot in class and in the 
field with great teachers. 
• A recent partnership with Greenwich Country Day School and the Success Academy Network 
of charter schools will provide a base for the production of a new collection of classroom-ready 
educational material on The Poetry of Art Sport, and Play. This collection will include discussions 
on poems filmed everywhere from sports fields to Broadway theaters, and will feature dancers, 
athletes, fashion designers, and more. 
• With a growing archive of footage capturing teachers and students reading American poems, 
we are eager to expand our reach and move into America's schools, disseminating, testing, 
and learning from teachers and students using our materials. We hope to be able to begin work 
evaluating the impact of poetry on literacy levels and character development and, eventually, to 
produce a full suite of materials that foster character development along with intellectual growth. 
Working closely with such partners as The Nantucket Project, Nautilus Magazine, The Aspen Ideas 
Festival, and The Big Think, and, of course, HarvardX, Harvard's provider of free open online 
courses, we are continuing to create rich educational media on poetry for adult learners and 
lifelong learners. These materials include short form videos such as this one on Robert Pinsky's  
Shirt (as featured in The New Yorker), and, this spring, the sixth module of the free seven-part 
Poetry in America MOOC, which has registrants in over 150 countries. 
Growing rapidly, and outpacing our current staff and infrastructure, Poetry in America has a 
fundraising goal this year of 2.5 million dollars to fund its expanding group of projects. We've taken 
a big step, hiring the design agency Threespot to help us develop our web presence. Our 
website— to launch early 2016— will eventually serve as an online hub for our TV show and 
educational projects. We hope you'll join us then for a virtual launch! 
Finally, Jeffrey, you have been such a wonderful supporter of my Poetry in America project. The 
Leon Black gift changed everything for me last year. It paid salaries for staff I desperately needed to 
complete projects (detail below), but first and foremost, it gave me leverage, enabling me to set 
down a solid Harvard base for my activities by giving the school something to point to: this public 
humanities project among the list of projects the Dean supports. The money did it: as soon as they 
heard about the gift, they took my project more seriously. Because of that gift, the Faculty of Arts 
and Sciences, which is space-stingy, found and rewired a studio space for me to house my video 
production operation and team. That gift woke up the Deans to the importance of Harvard's role in 
producing the highest quality humanities content for the WORLD, and not just for Harvard students. 
My main employee has half of her salary paid with these funds, and the foundation of our collection 
for PBS LeamingMedia is being made with this support. This gift represented one of the most 
consequential shifts of the last year, allowing me create content and launch projects this year that 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028947 
make future projects that much more likely. If I can keep this base sturdy at Harvard, refilling these 
coffers, I will be that much more able to keep working. 
I am also so grateful for the help you gave me in defining my project for Templeton, and, what help 
you have offered to give in bringing them around. I have, since Templeton turned me down, gotten 
funding to produce video on two of the poems I'd proposed to Templeton and to create, and test, 
that video in schools as I proposed. One of my partners in that project is Success Academy, where I 
could also expand my work with Templeton. And there are still other poems that may satisfy their 
character criteria more fully, including the third of the poems I'd originally proposed and that Joe 
Biden had agreed to discuss with me (on parenthood and humility). At this point, I'm gaining the 
platform and the name recognition to be an effective spokesperson for the foundation on building 
literacy and character in the schools. 
It really means a lot to me, all financial help aside, Jeffrey, that you are rooting for me and thinking 
about me. You push back a lot (as Larry does), and it's always annoying but I always learn. 
With abundant gratitude,

purchased a Palm Beach property Mr. Epstein had planned to buy, behind Mr. Epstein's back. And that Mr.

across the border in the Sinai. It was as if we’d never been there at all.

Yet there were the errors, setbacks and frustrations as well. Many months
into our planning, we conducted a series of run-throughs in which we simulated
attaching the intercept to Israel’s telephone network in the south, not far from
the camp where I’d done my fironut. Though it all seemed to go as planned, the
next morning in rained heavily. Within hours, the phone company was getting
reports from all around southern Israel of phones malfunctioning. Even
allowing for the fact it rained less in the Sinai, we had to address the risk. I went
to see the people in Meir Amit’s technology unit, and they began developing a
waterproofing system for the equipment.

The main problem with the equipment, however, was its sheer weight. The
helicopter could get us, and it, into Egypt. But we couldn’t fly directly to the
cable site in the Sinai. We might just as well tell the Egyptians we were on our
way. At around 1,100 pounds, it was much too heavy for us to carry. And if we
were going to go ahead with the mission, time was running short. A date for the
operation had been set by the kirya: February 1964. I was not alone in believing
that, unless we cracked the problem of getting the equipment to the cable site,
the operation was impossible.

The solution came from a staff officer in military intelligence. Meir Amit
visited our base once a month to hear how the preparations were going. With the
date getting closer, he brought along his entire staff. When I raised my concern
about the weight problem, a colonel from his personnel section said: “Why not
build a lightweight rickshaw, small enough to get in the door of the helicopter,
but which can carry all or most of the equipment once you’re on the ground?”
Within days, they had a prototype, made of airline-standard tubing and designed
to be pulled by two men. We held an exercise in the Negev. But it was almost
impossible for two men to pull through the sand. It also left deep zig-zag
imprints in the sand, which would surely raise the suspicions of the Egyptians.

But prototype number-two was a four-wheel, chrome alloy cart. The
technology experts had made the axles telescopic, so the vehicle would get
through the door of the chopper but could be expanded to the width of an
Egyptian army Jeep. They had borrowed nose wheels from a training jet. To
complete their oeuvre, they glued on real tire tread from one of the Egyptian
Jeeps we had captured in the 1956 war.

August 11, 2016

A federal jury decided Thursday that one of the Middle East’s most prominent banks did not commit fraud and
steal technology from an Irvine firm that sued it for half a billion dollars in damages after their partnership
collapsed.

Orange County company InfoSpan had alleged that Emirates NBD ended a partnership for a mobile payment
system because it didn’t want to share revenue and stole InfoSpan’s technology to launch its own service.
The Dubai-based bank, in turn, denied it stole or ever used InfoSpan’s technology. It argued that it cancelled
the partnership because InfoSpan couldn’t produce a working product and misled it into thinking it was an
established company, not one with little to no track record.

After deliberating for a day, the jury unanimously decided that InfoSpan did not prove its case of fraud and
theft of trade secrets.

InfoSpan had asked for $540 million in damages. An attorney for InfoSpan declined to comment on the

also consults with other bureaucracies that may have a stake in the issue. The draft
policy proposals are then forwarded to the Leading Small Groups (448), which
deliberate, vet, and sign off on the policy proposals before sending them to the
Politburo and the Politburo Standing Committee for a final decision. These leading
small groups, which range in size from five to a dozen members, are normally
chaired by a Politburo member and include a range of ministerial-level officials
relevant to that functional policy area. Some meet at regular intervals (biweekly),
whereas most convene on an ad hoc basis when necessary. In this formal, ministry-
or department-initiated process, the ultimate decision-making authority lies with the

Politburo Standing Committee.

At this level of policy formulation, of particular relevance to China’s international
influence activities are the External Propaganda Leading Group (WHE AS 46),
which has a dual bureaucratic identity as the State Council Information Office (B4-#1
Hs); the Central Committee Propaganda Department (PHAREHRB); the Central
Committee United Front Work Department (FHP RAKE); the Central Committee
Foreign Affairs Commission (F#}22 AS);' and the Central Committee Education
Leading Small Group (RB). Although bureaucratically ranked slightly lower, the
Ministry of Culture and Tourism, the Ministry of Education, the newly created Voice
of China, and the Xinhua News Agency all exercise policy formulation and oversight

roles in their functional domains.

There is also a parallel top-down policy process initiated by one of the top leaders
on the Politburo Standing Committee. As a rule, Xi Jinping, the CCP general
secretary, has broad authority and may issue a brief directive on a matter he
believes should receive extra attention or priority. (Typically, such directives are
short comments he writes on reports that come across his desk.) Otherwise, only
a Politburo Standing Committee (PBSC) member overseeing a particular portfolio
can issue such directives on matters that fall into his area of responsibility. Such
comments are then related to the functional bureaucracies and can lead to the
formulation of a new policy, the modification of an existing policy, or other

actions.

On the Politburo and its seven-member PBSC, several members have direct
responsibility for external affairs. As the chair of the Foreign Affairs Commission, Xi
has overall authority on all aspects of China’s foreign relations. Wang Huning, the

Standing Committee member responsible for Party affairs, ideology, and propaganda,

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025781.txt,"Economic Research: How Increasing Income Inequality Is Dampening U.S. Economic Growth, And Possible Ways
To Change The Tide

Meanwhile, the experiences of developing and emerging economies suggest that igniting growth is less difficult than
sustaining it (52). Even the poorest of countries have managed to expand their economies for several years--only for

growth to falter.

Berg and Ostry found that income inequality is the single most important factor in determining which countries can
sustain economic growth. Using the GINI coefficient--which ranges from 0 to 1.0--they measured the extent to which
economic growth falls as inequality rises. A country in which everyone earns exactly the same would have a score of 0,
while a society in which one person owned everything would have a score of 1.0. Berg and Ostry saw that a GINI
coefficient of higher than 0.45 could weigh on growth. Although correlation is not causation, we note that, based on
after-tax income, the U.S. economy scored 0.434 on the GINI scale in 2010, according to the CBO, placing it near that
threshold (53).

To be sure, it seems counterintuitive that inequality is associated with less-sustainable growth, since some inequality,
by providing incentives to effort and entrepreneurship, may be essential to a functioning market economy. But beyond
the risk that inequality may heighten the susceptibility of an economy to booms and busts, it may also spur political
instability--thus discouraging investment. Inequality may make it harder for governments to enact policies to
prevent--or soften--shocks, such as raising taxes or cutting public spending to avoid a debt crisis. The affluent may
exercise disproportionate influence on the political process, or the needs of the less affluent may grow so severe as to

make additional cuts to fiscal stabilizers that operate automatically in a downturn politically unviable.

Striking A Palatable Balance

The discussion about income inequality is hardly new, and contrary opinions abound. In his influential 1975 book
Equality and Efficiency: The Big Tradeoff, economist Arthur Okun argued that pursuing equality can reduce
efficiency. He claimed that not only would more equal income distribution reduce work and investment incentives, but

the efforts to redistribute wealth--through, for example, taxes and minimum wages--can themselves be costly (54).

Of course, income inequality in the U.S. was much less 40 years ago. Kristin Forbes found that, in the short- and
medium-terms over a few years, an increase in income inequality has a significant positive relationship with economic
expansion (55). But Forbes also found that the relationship was weakened (or could turn negative) when she increased
the length of the growth spells. And a World Bank study later found that the positive effect on growth was almost

exclusively reserved for the top end of the income distribution (56).

Income inequality can contribute to economic growth, and a degree of inequality is a necessary part of what keeps any
market economic engine operating on all cylinders. Indeed, a degree of inequality is to be expected in any market
economy, given differences in initial endowments (of wealth and ability), the differential market returns to

investments in human capital and entrepreneurial activities, and the effect of luck.

However, too much of the focus in the debate about inequality has been on the top earners, rather than on how to lift a
significant portion of the population out of poverty--which would be a good thing for the economy. And though
extreme inequality can impair economic growth, badly designed and implemented efforts to reverse this trend could

also undermine growth, hurting the very people such policies are meant to help (57).

December 30th, 2014, that every massage given to anybody
at Mr. Epstein's residence was a code word for sexual
abuse?

A. It was my understanding that the term
massage was frequently, if not almost invariably, used
as a code word for sexual abuse, or at least sexual
activity, if the girl happened to be over the age of 18.
But in most cases at least, or in many cases depending
on exactly what universe you're looking at, these were
underage girls, under the age of consent in the State of
Florida, they were under the age of 18.

Sometimes as young as -- I think it went all
the way down to, gosh, I'm trying to remember now, I
think 13 or 14 was was the youngest age in the police
report.

Q. Is it your position that as of December 30th,
2014, you had a sufficient basis under the Federal Rules
of Procedure and applicable ethical rules to allege that
anyone who got a massage at Mr. Epstein's residence had
abused minors?

A. No.

Q. What -- back up now. With respect again to
other minors as of December 30th, 2014, had anyone --
had any young woman, other than -- we will put -- I'm

going to ask about Virginia Roberts separately.

participate in the debt exchanges, and may turn out to own less Greek debt than currently believed. [Note: bank
participation in the Latin Brady bond era was high, since at the time, banks held almost all the paper, and in the form of
illiquid loans].

The big question: would Germany still live up to the deal if Greece missed deficit targets or assets sales, if bank
participation was too low, or if hedge funds (once referred to by the Chairman of the German Social Democratic Party as
a “swarm of locusts’) reaped large free rider windfalls? Ultimately, this is a political question. If “yes”, Germany will
underwrite Greece no matter what; if “no”, then a broader, coercive Greek restructuring might follow in the not-so-distant
future.

In addition to execution risk in Greece, we are left with 3 other concerns. The current EU-IMF lending facility
capacity is Eur 255 bn, but we anticipate that as agreed, national parliaments will expand it to 440 bn. First concern:
while that’s to deal with problems in Greece, Portugal and Ireland, if you include Spain, it gets tight (note: the chart
excludes costs to recapitalize banks). If Italy or Belgium entered Europe’s Liquidity Hospital, a lot more money might be
needed from European parliaments (in one worst-case scenario, Alliance Bernstein estimates that the EU lending facility
would have to increase from 440 bn to 1.7 trillion Euros, mostly from Germany). Italy faces a multi-notch downgrade
from Moody’s, which is not going to help. As we discussed two weeks ago, Italy has been a model citizen in terms of
running low budget deficits for 20 years, but still cannot escape the confines of its very large existing debt stock (120% of
GDP).

Second, as shown below, Europe is now a two-speed economy, with the periphery stuck in neutral (industrial production
is one proxy for this; there are others, such as unemployment, consumption, export shares, etc). If the idea behind the
EU/IMF effort is that austerity will boost growth and lead these countries back to the public markets, there is very little
momentum in this direction. If the status quo in the periphery does not change, all the EU package does is allow the
current approach more time to fail.

"
IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013859.txt,"purchase order. Our meetings were now no more than five minutes long.

From this moment forward, resolve to keep those around you focused and avoid all meetings, whether
in person or remote, that do not have clear objectives. It is possible to do this tactfully, but expect that
some time wasters will be offended the first few times their advances are rejected. Once it is clear that
remaining on task is your policy and not subject to change, they will accept it and move on with life.
Hard feelings pass. Don’t suffer fools or you'll become one.

It is your job to train those around you to be effective and efficient. No one else will do it for you.
Here are a few recommendations:

1. Decide that, given the non-urgent nature of most issues, you will steer people toward the following
means of communication, in order of preference: e-mail, phone, and in-person meetings. If someone
proposes a meeting, request an e-mail instead and then use the phone as your fallback offer if need be.
Cite other immediately pending work tasks as the reason.

2. Respond to voicemail via e-mail whenever possible. This trains people to be concise. Help them
develop the habit.

Similar to our opening greeting on the phone, e-mail communication should be streamlined to prevent
needless back-and-forth. Thus, an e-mail with “Can you meet at 4:00 P.M.?” would become “Can you
meet at 4:00 P.M.? If so If not, please advise three other times that work for you.”

This “if ... then” structure becomes more important as you check e-mail less often. Since I only check
e-mail once a week, it is critical that no one needs a “what if?” answered or other information within
seven days of a given e-mail I send. If I suspect that a manufacturing order hasn’t arrived at the shipping
facility, for example, [Il send an e-mail to my shipping facility manager along these lines: “Dear Susan
... Has the new manufacturing shipment arrived? If so, please advise me on ... If not, please contact John
Doe at 555-5555 or via e-mail at john@doe.com (he is also CC’d) and advise on delivery date and
tracking. John, if there are any issues with the shipment, please coordinate with Susan, reachable at 555—
4444, who has the authority to make decisions up to $500 on my behalf. In case of emergency, call me
on my cell phone, but I trust you two. Thanks.” This prevents most follow-up questions, avoids two
separate dialogues, and takes me out of the problem-solving equation.

Get into the habit of considering what “if ... then” actions can be proposed in any e-mail where you
ask a question.

3. Meetings should only be held to make decisions about a predefined situation, not to define the
problem. If someone proposes that you meet with them or “set a time to talk on the phone,” ask that
person to send you an e-mail with an agenda to define the purpose:

That sounds doable. So I can best prepare, can you please send me an e-mail with an agenda? That is,
the topics and questions we’ll need to address? That would be great. Thanks in advance.

Don’t give them a chance to bail out. The “thanks in advance” before a retort increases your chances
of getting the e-mail.

The e-mail medium forces people to define the desired outcome of a meeting or call. Nine times out
of ten, a meeting is unnecessary and you can answer the questions, once defined, via e-mail. Impose this
habit on others. I haven’t had an in-person meeting for my business in more than five years and have had
fewer than a dozen conference calls, all lasting less than 30 minutes.

Hi Jeffrey
Happy to talk to you almost anytime today until around 3PM. Just tell me what number | should reach.

Not sure what got lost in translation here: never had the intention to go to any art fair or art show or
anything of the kind.

All the artists we have in mind or send to you are people we have direct connections with. Not just their
studio, but also their home. They are people the work of whom we follow, and many of them are already
friendly (Arianna, Cali have had dinner or stayed home).

The idea is absolutely to have an impact on the ecosystem and to make a difference by supporting great
artists when they need it.

Galleries references are important, because galleries allow artist to reach a broader audience. We would go
directly to the source.

This is why it's important for me to go to LA or Berlin (or elsewhere) because those artists are not rich yet,
they dont travel so much. They belong to a scene, and it does make a big difference to them if you connect
in person.

The spirit is to have an impact on young, talented folks, and absolutely to stay at the source.

could be found in all real physical, biological and psychological systems. For some
examples: One of his archetypal singularities was a boundary at x = 0 such that the
flow couldn’t spread from where it was in x>0O into x< 0 and was therefore like the
border, the membrane, between the inside and outside of a cell as well as the
hoped for sociopolitical functions of the Great Wall of China and the Maginot Line. If
we were to blow up the boundary line from two to three dimensions, R’—R®, the
straight boundary line becomes a cylinder for directionally organizing and
connecting flows as in blood vessels, oil pipes, cables and wires. Since production
and delivery need not occur at similar rates, temporary storage is required and may
take the form of a spherical blow-up in the vertical segment of R® leading to an open
bottle which may serve as a dead end storage branch of a network of connected
cylinders. In the conceptual reductionism of Semiophysics, Thom said, “...life is
essentially a question of embankment, canalization and the struggle to stem
dispersion.” These structures of mind and world are built and maintained.
Coagulation of blood is an example of a canalized fluid repairing gaps like a
tubeless tire. Thom considered apparent the problem of making something from
nothing, birth, that of finding the hidden sources: the bubbling spring emerges from
an unseen, underground network of canalized fluid flow converging on the apparent
source, birth being the invisible becoming visible. In contrast, a canalized flow
emptying into lake can represent disappearance as a flow.

Mathematicians from all over the world attended Thom’s 65 birthday
celebration at HES. His Field’s Medal winning work on the topology of differentiable
(smooth) manifolds, cobordism and related ideas, was mentioned frequently, and
great homage paid to him with respect to these areas of his work. However, in two
days of lectures of personal and professional tribute by the world’s great
mathematicians, his work relevant to Catastrophe Theory and Semiophysics was
not mentioned, even once. The form taken by mathematicians’ most severe
judgments is silence. As the New York Times’ Natalie Angier’s comments indicated,

this is not the time for the intuitive conduct of applied mathematics.

computer presumably to thumb drives or other external storage
devices. This download occurred just days before Snowden left the
NSA on May 17, 2013, having told the agency that he needed a med-
ical leave of absence.

The quantity of stolen documents, 1.7 million, does not necessar-
ily reveal the damage and can itself be misleading. Many documents
do not reveal current or known sources or methods, and others may
have little value to an enemy. And a large portion of the documents
might have been duplications. The quality of some of these docu-
ments is another matter. Just one document that exposed a source
or method of which enemies are unaware can be of immense value.
One such document taken by Snowden provided what Ledgett called
“a roadmap” to the NSA’s current secret operations, revealing to an
adversary such as Russia, China, or Iran “what we know, what we
don’t know, and, implicitly, a way to protect themselves.” There were
many documents in the Snowden breach that met these criteria,

General Alexander closely followed the investigation as it devel-
oped over the summer of 2013. By then, of course, the whole world
knew that Snowden had stolen a vast trove of NSA documents.
Alexander saw major inconsistencies developing between Snowden’s
personal account of the theft and what had actually happened. The
timeline established by the government’s investigators did not
match Snowden’s story line. “Something is not right,” Alexander
said in an interview.

For one thing, Snowden had made the claim to journalists, four
months after he was in Russia, that he had turned over all the
documents he took from the NSA’s compartments to Poitras and
Greenwald in Hong Kong. On August 18, the investigators had the
opportunity to examine the files that Snowden had given to Poitras
and Greenwald. This discovery came when British authorities, under
Schedule 7 of Britain’s Terrorism Act, detained David Miranda,
Greenwald’s romantic partner, at Heathrow Airport. Miranda was
suspected of acting as a courier for Greenwald and Poitras. Accord-

But we shouldn't necessarily blame people for this instinct to reject and categorize: the
instinct is one that comes from being scared and oppressed... because the social penalties
for getting it wrong” are high. Remember, those New York City dominatrixes thought
they were safe from the law as long as BDSM didn't count as sex. But as soon as
someone decided BDSM counted as sex, those dominatrixes were arrested.

It's just one more example of how sexual stigma for different kinds of sex is constantly
intertwined. No type of consensual sexuality can express itself freely until people agree
that among consenting adults, there is no 'should’. The Romans, those ancient
imperialists, used to say: Divide and conquer. When consensual sexualities are scared
of each other, we will continue to be conquered. As long as vanilla people are afraid
of BDSM... as long as BDSMers are afraid of being seen as sexual... as long
as the social penalties for being a slut or a whore are incredibly steep... as long
as sex workers are stigmatized and criminalized... everyone will be bound by these
oppressive standards.

KOK ok

The Embodied Side of BDSM versus Sex

Although Part 1 was all about how the divide between BDSM and sex is often
nonsensical, or purely political, or socially constructed... that doesn't mean that the
divide does not exist. I once had a conversation about ignoring social constructs with a
wise friend, who noted dryly that: One-way streets are a social construct. That doesn't
mean we should ignore them. Just because the outside world influences our sexuality,
does not mean that our sexual preferences are invalid.

Some polyamorous BDSMers have very different rules about having sex with outsiders,
as opposed to doing BDSM with outsiders. For example, during the time when I was
considering a transition to polyamory, I myself had a couple relationships where we were
sexually monogamous -- yet my partners agreed that I could do BDSM with people who
weren't my partner. Those particular partners felt jealous and threatened by the idea
of me having sex with another man, but they didn't mind if I did BDSM with
another man. Maybe the feelings of those partners only arose because they categorized
BDSM and sex into weirdly different socially-constructed ways... but those
partners' feelings were nonetheless real, and their feelings deserved respect.

And there are also unmistakable ways that BDSM feels different from sex. There is
something, bodily, that is just plain different about BDSM, as opposed to sex. I often
find myself thinking of BDSM feelings and sexual feelings as flowing down two
parallel channels in my head... sometimes these channels intersect, but sometimes they're
far apart. The BDSM urge strikes me as deeply different, separate, from the sex urge. It
can be fun to combine BDSM and sex, but there are definitely times when I want BDSM
that feel very unlike most times when I want sex.

The biggest political reason why it's difficult to discuss this is the way in which we
currently conceptualize sexuality through orientations: we have built a cultural
“orientation model focused on the idea that acceptable sexuality is built-in, or

Do you know what the Most Innovative Location Device is?

No it’s not a compass or an astrolabe. It’s not semaphore or a smoke signal. Not an RFID tag or a
neon sign or phosphorous flare either.

Give up?

It’s the GPS Smart Shoe™ recently mentioned in Forbes Magazine, developed by GTX Corp
(OTCBB: GTXO.OB) and licensed to Aetrex Worldwide. Yes, a shoe...well a very smart shoe as
it can tell a caregiver the precise location, bearing, history, speed and altitude of an Alzheimer’s
victim that has eloped or wandered. No small feat — pun intended — to reduce the overwhelming
stress on the millions of victim caregivers while potentially saving thousands from injuries and
death owing to exposure, accidents and criminal activity. The GPS Shoe also reduces the
manpower drain on municipal services; fire, police and welfare agencies often enlisted to locate
the mentally ill.

While a Finalist in the Most Innovative Location Device category of the Locations & Beyond
Summit and the People’s Choice Awards is a wonderful acknowledgment for the years GTXO
invested in developing the solution and the promise that Aetrex has made in bringing the Shoe to
market... the real winners are those touched by this devastating disease for which there is no cure,

but now have a new measure of hope.

Some examples from my personal Hall of Fame of true First Amendment believers:

- Women against Pornography and Censorship is an organization that tries to educate
the public about what they perceive to be the sexist evils of pornography. But at the
same time, they try to educate about the evils of censorship, reminding their listeners
that if the government is given the power to censor pornography today, then
tomorrow it may demand the power to prohibit the publication of information about
birth control and abortion.

- Action for Children’s Television strongly opposed much of the daily fare to which our
children are exposed on the boob tube, but they also oppose censorship of television
by the Federal Communications Commission.

- Those Jews, including some Holocaust survivors, who defended the rights of the Nazis
to march through Skokie and who now defend the rights of hateful Holocaust deniers
to publish their garbage.

- Those pro-choice activists who refuse to call the cops when right-to-lifers picket in
front of abortion clinics.

One group that is in danger of being drummed out of the First Amendment Hall of Fame is the
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Until recently, it was a charter member. But in recent
years some of its branches have gotten soft on the First Amendment when it comes to racist,
sexist and homophobic speech on college campuses. The ACLU has refused to defend the rights
of the CIA to recruit on campus. It was nowhere to be seen when Dartmouth University
disciplined members of the right-wing Dartmouth Review for engaging in “vexatious,”
“aggressive,” and “confrontational” speech against an African-American professor and as
mentioned earlier, some of its leaders defended the right of pro-Palestinian students to shut down
a pro-Israel speaker. As of now, the ACLU is still a member, but it is getting close to being
placed on probation.

If you want to join the First Amendment Club, you must attend at least one free speech rally in
support of views that you thoroughly despise. I mean really hate! It is not enough to say, as
some do about the Mappelthorpe photographs, “Well, that’s really not my taste, but I don’t see
why others who enjoy that kind of thing shouldn’t be free to see it.” That’s cheating. You must
find something that really disgusts, angers, or offends you to the core. Condemn the content, but
go out and defend its right to be expressed. Then come and claim your First Amendment
membership card. Too few Americans qualify for the card. Until more do, the First Amendment
will always be at risk, because it is always being confronted with new and unanticipated
challenges.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015652.txt,"Mr. Dershowitz agrees to make his client, Jeffrey Epstein, and others with relevant
testimony and with whom he has testified he shares a “common interest” — at least Epstein
and Maxwell — available to any law enforcement agency reviewing any alleged criminal
activities; or in the alternative, to attest to this Court that those necessary witnesses have
consented to full cooperation in the investigation Mr. Dershowitz is seeking permission to
initiate.

Mr. Dershowitz agrees to waive the statute of limitations in all jurisdictions for any
criminal conduct he participated in or was aware of relating to Ms. Giuffre so that law
enforcement can pursue any necessary charges. Defendant Dershowitz proclaimed that he
was willing to waive any statute of limitation for criminal conduct so this should not be an
issue. See Exhibit D, January 12, 2016 Deposition Transcript of Alan Dershowitz at 395.
“T had talked about the statute of limitations for criminal purpose was what I said, that I
would waive the statute of limitations for criminal purposes.”

Mr. Dershowitz agrees to provide the names and contact information for each State
Attorney and United States Attorney for which he has or is planning to provide
information relating to Ms. Giuffre; and agrees to jointly, with Ms. Giuffre’s counsel,
request that the State Attorney and United States Attorney, in the relevant jurisdictions,
investigate all potential criminal conduct. Both parties may provide any relevant
information they have that may assist the authorities with their investigation.

For all other purposes non-party Ms. Giuffre’s January 16, 2016 deposition transcript shall

remain confidential and sealed other than for confidential disclosure to law enforcement as
described above.

2. Mr. Dershowitz Has No “Evidence” of Perjury And Instead Is Simply Trying To
Bully This Victim

As explained above, Defendant Dershowitz wrongly suggests to this Court that non-party

Virginia Giuffre has committed perjury in an effort to taint the Court against this victim. His only

“evidence” of this alleged perjury is a self-serving opinion from his retained expert that an

“absence of records” in response to a FOJA request, establishes that former President Clinton was

never on Jeffrey Epstein’s island in the USVI. Defendant Dershowitz misrepresents the

government’s response. The government is only required to conduct a reasonable search of

readily accessible records. Accordingly, an “absence of records” response does not mean that

records do not exist. It simply means that in the course of the search, no records were found. See

Cunningham v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 961 F.Supp. 2d 226, 236 (D.C. 2013) (court reasoning that

the settlements on the West Bank. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, hundreds of
thousands of Russians had also flowed into Israel. Most were Jewish in culture
more than religious observance, but they were instinctively inclined to support
candidates — Rabin in 1992, and Bibi the last time around — who they felt were
likely to take a tough line in any peace negotiations with the Arabs.

I was never going to get the backing of many West Bank settlers, or of core
supporters of the Likud and parties even further to the right. But I would need to
make at least some dent in Bibi’s hold on the Russian voters who had supported
him by a wide margin in 1996. I focused first on Yisrael Ba’Aliyah, the main
Russian immigrant political party. It had been set up by the iconic Soviet-era
refusenik Natan Sharansky — or, as he was then known, Anatoly Sharansky. He’d
been an ally of Andrei Sakharov, an outspoken human rights advocate and, until he
was finally released and allowed to leave in 1986, a political prisoner in the gulag.
Though Natan’s party was not going to offer a formal endorsement for any
candidate, I met with him to press the case for “security and peace,” the message
I’d tried to advance with Shimon three years earlier, and to emphasize the need to
bring unity and shared purpose back to the country. Though I think he would have
been receptive anyway, it didn’t hurt that he, like me, was a mathematics graduate
— from Moscow’s Physics and Technology Institute. He was also a chess
aficionado. When I was rash enough to face him across the board, as I recall, it
took him all of five minutes, and seven moves, to checkmate me.

But I also made dozens of visits to Russian community groups, and met with
individual families whenever I could. Often, I found myself talking to older men
and women among the immigrants about the military details of the Great Patriotic
War, as the Russians called World War Two. On a number of occasions, I accepted
the invitation to sit down and play on a sitting-room piano. I think the first time I
got a sense that any of this might be having an impact was in a quote from a
Yisrael Ba’Aliyah official in an Israeli newspaper. Though still stopping short of a
formal endorsement, the official was quoted as saying: “A month ago, young
Russians thought Barak was a boring, left-wing socialist party leader who doesn’t
look good on TV and mumbles a lot... Today, they see him as a high-ranking
Israeli general who knows how to play the piano. The Russian immigrants like
strong, cultured people.” Except for the bit about mumbling, I couldn’t have
wished for more.

The Billionaire Pedophile's Sex Den

BEAD THIS SKIP THAT

The Daily Beast reveals new details about the twisted sex life of
Jeffrey Epstein and his penchant for underage girls. Conchita
Sarnoff on his massages, sex toys, and questionable deals. Also:

¢ Nude images of young girls were scattered around the house and the
bathroom soap was shaped like sex organs

¢ Staff trolled for fresh recruits to make sure Epstein had two or three
massage appointments each day

¢ The house manager has been sentenced to a longer prison term than Newseom
Epstein—for trying to sell notes regarding massage appointments

¢ Epstein gave $1 million to his friend Jean Luc Brunel when he was starting the modeling agency MC2

* According to a former bookkeeper, young girls were brought to the U.S. by MC2—often from Eastern
Europe—then traveled on Epstein’s private jets

Jeffrey Epstein’s loyal friends say that his prosecution was unduly harsh, rather than outrageously lenient. They insist
that his sexual habits, although obsessive and unusual, were mostly legal and essentially harmless. As the police
records aitest, the girls brought to El Brillo Way were routinely told they could “say no” at any time during a massage
as Epstein escalated contact in a step-by-step assault that was remarkably similar in every victim’s statement: First
she would be asked to remove her shirt, then her pants. He would attempt to fondle her buttocks and breasts as he
masturbated, then bring out a large vibrator. There was sometimes digital penetration, and the more willing girls were
lured into full-blown sexual relations with both Epstein and Nadia Marcinkova, who was referred to in press accounts
and police reports as Epstein’s live-in “sex slave.”

A former bookkeeper in the Miami office, who also arranged visas for girls
traveling to the U.S., confirmed that MC2 girls became frequent guests on
Epstein’s private jets.

It’s true that some underage girls may have fied about their age, and some came to the house voluntarily several
times—although, according to Florida statutes, none of that has any bearing on the criminality of the contact,
particularly if the girl was 16 or younger. But what is particularly disturbing about this case—judging by arrangements
at the Palm Beach house—is that Epstein, a billionaire hedge-fund manager, organized his life around this sexual
compulsion in an open and methodical way that suggests he felt he was beyond the law.

According to police who executed a search warrant, the house was

In February 2017, we entered into a license agreement that governs the rights of certain intellectual property owned by us and the rights of
certain intellectual property owned by DriveTime. The license agreement, which was amended and restated on April 14, 2017, generally provides that each
party grants to the other certain limited exclusive (other than with respect to the licensor party and its affiliates) and nonexclusive licenses to use certain of
its intellectual property, and each party agrees to certain covenants not to sue the other party, its affiliates and certain of its service providers in connection
with various patent claims. The exclusive license to DriveTime is limited to the business that is primarily of sub-prime used car sales to retail customers.

On October 22, 2015, we entered into an agreement, which was amended on May 15, 2017, to share usage of two aircraft operated by
DriveTime. Pursuant to the agreement, we agreed to rermburse DriveTime for actual expenses for each of our flights. The original term of the agreement
was for 12 months, with perpetual 12-month automatic renewals. Either the lessors or the lessees can terminate the lease with 30 days’ written notice. We

We are working on getting the following article placed in the Hill or the Politico within the next week. As of now it looks 
like former Chairman of Armed Services, Congressman Ron Dellums, will be the author. Please keep highly 
confidential. Will keep you posted on if, when and where it gets published. Once it is published we can all circulate it 
highly. We believe that this article sets the tone for the advocacy we will be doing and having someone very prominent 
like Congressman Dellums will also be a great way to launch this campaign. 
Congressman Ronald Dellums is a thirteen term Member of the U.S. House of Representatives (D-CA) who 
served from 1971-1998. He also served as the 48th Mayor of Oakland from 2007-2011. Dellums served as the 
Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and the House Committee on the District of Columbia. He 
also served on the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Post Office and Civil Service Committee, the Permanent 
Select Committee on Intelligence and co-founded the Congressional Black Caucus. 
Senegal's Democratic Backslide 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028776 
2015 was a banner year for democracy in Africa. Nigeria, the largest country on the continent, had a 
democratic election, and even more impressively, had its first ever peaceful transition of power when sitting 
President Goodluck Jonathan transferred power to Muhammadu Buhari. Former President Jonathan conceded 
and famously declared, Nobody's ambition is worth the blood of any Nigerian. My last piece for The Hill 
was titled, 'Will Guinea's experiment in democracy succeed? It is with great joy that I can report that it 
did! Guinea's first democratically elected President, Alpha Conde, won his reelection campaign in a peaceful 
election that was internationally monitored in which the Guinean electorate reaffirmed its commitment to a 
democracy. 
Despite these victories for democracy in a continent in which I dedicated a great deal of my life's work, I am 
deeply troubled by developments over the last few weeks. Earlier this week Uganda President Yoweri 
Museveni extended his thirty year rule and won his fifth consecutive election which international observers 
said was marred with intimidation and impropriety. Shortly after the election Museveni, who scrapped 
constitutional term limits a decade ago, had his political rival, Kizza Besigye arrested and detained for 
protesting the election results. Of course we have come to expect these actions from Museveni in 
Uganda. What I am even most troubled by is what is taking place in Senegal, which was once the pillar of 
democracy in Africa. 
When Abdoulaye Wade was democratically elected as President of Senegal in 2000, it was a huge step 
forward for democracy in Africa. President Wade adopted a new constitution and instituted term limits for the 
first time in Senegalese history. In 2012 President Wade was defeated in a democratic election by his Prime 
Minister Macky Sall. The United States and the larger international community praised Wade for his quick 
concession and praised peaceful transition of power. President Macky Sall affirmed his commitment to 
democracy announcing that he would shorten term limits from 7 to 5 years. President Obama visited Senegal in 
June of 2013 and praised President Sall for his commitment to democracy in shortening the presidential 
mandate and praised the country's rule of law. 
Unfortunately in the past few years much has changed and we are witnessing a backslide in what was once 
Africa's brightest democratic success story. When the opposition party, the Senegalese Democratic Party, 
designated former President Abdoulaye Wade' son, former Minister Karim Wade, as their candidate for the next 
presidential election; President Sall had Karim Wade arrested and detained. President Macky Sall then 
reestablished a special court by presidential decree that had been abolished by Senegalese law and not heard a 
case in thirty years. This newly established special court sentenced Mr. Wade to six years in prison. He remains 
in prison today, sentenced without appeal. In April 2015, the United Nations Working Group of Arbitrary 
Detention determined that Mr. Wade was arbitrarily arrested and that his detention was in violation of 
international law. Last month the UN Working Group reaffirmed its finding and called on President Sall's 
regime to release Karim Wade and comply with international law. Sall has ignored the UN Working Groups 
request. 
Last week the backslide continued even further as President Macky Sall reneged on his commitment to shorten 
term limits. Instead of holding elections next year, after five years per his commitment, he announced that he 
would serve until 2019. He claims that this decision was based on the opinion - just an opinion - of the 
Constitutional Council that he had himself sought. 
In light of the trend toward democracy in Africa as exemplified by Nigeria and Guinea, it is very concerning 
that one of the United States' closest allies and Africa's strongest democracies appears to be retrogressing. The 
destabilization of democracy in Senegal could have significant consequences in the entire region. The United 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028777 
States must get in front of this negative trend before spreads across Africa and it is too late. The U.S. should 
call for President Sall to honor the request of the UN Working Group and release his political rival Mr. Wade 
and also keep his pledge of a 5 year presidential mandate. President Obama has said that Africa is more 
important than ever to security and prosperity in the U.S. We have worked very hard in implementing and 
prioritizing democracy and democratic succession in Africa. The Obama administration must not let our hard 
work be compromised in Senegal, we have worked too hard and come too far.

Dear Vinoda and Bob, 
Please see attached the last version of the revised draft letter. We have made some modifications and amendments 
we submit to your proposal. You can finalize the letter as it suits you. We strongly recommend to wait Wednesday 
or Tuesday this week before sending the letter as Amnesty International will issue on Wednesday 24th February 
its worldwide report on human right situation. It is highly probable that major statement will be made on Mr. 
Wade case in the report on Senegal, which will give us more input for the letter.

A. Not -- you know, let's break that down ina
couple pieces.

The fact that his name is circled, if I were
running an FBI investigation, I'd go send somebody to
see what he knew about it, but no, it would take a fot
more for me to become suspicious that somebody is
involved in -- in sexual activity like that.

Q. Okay. So you would agree with me then, that
the fact that a person often visited the mansion, the
person -- the fact that a person was a friend of
Mr. Epstein for 15 years, the fact that the person had
stated publicly that: Mr. Epstein liked young women
almost as much as I do myself,” and the fact that the
name is circled in the address book is not sufficient to
raise a Suspicion that that person engaged in sexual
misconduct?

A. So...

Q. Yes or no. It's a yes or no question.

A. It requires --

MR. SCAROLA: You're not required to answer
yes or no, if a yes or no response alone would be
misleading.

THE WITNESS: The problem is the word
suspicion. I'm not particularly suspicious on
those facts, but it -- you know, what do you mean

by suspicion? If 1 -- if I were running an FBI
investigation and somebody circled a name as --
as saying, look, this fellow may have some
information, I'd go follow up on that.

If you say that's suspicion, then the answer
would be, yes. But I -- you know, based on that
information alone, no. I mean that -- that
wouldn't -- wouldn't be enough for me to, you
know, invest time and energy into that particular
possibility.

BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. Okay. So none of those facts are sufficient
even to justify spending time and energy, correct?

A. Unless -- if I'm running -- this is -- again,
what do you mean by suspicion? Time and energy in the
context of somebody who is running a pro bono case with
limited resources to try to figure out what the sex
trafficking ring's going to do, I'm not going to chase
after that rabbit. It seems farfetched.

I'm going to focus my efforts on the people
who appear to be more directly involved.

Q. Okay. So based on the facts that I gave you
a moment ago, you think it's farfetched that Donald
Trump was engaged in abusing minors?

A. If that's all I had, I would not invest time

Q. And you referred to your pro bono case. What
is your best estimate of how much money you have made
representing victims of Jeffrey Epstein?

A. In which case are we talking about now?

Q. Any -- any case representing a victim of
Jeffrey Epstein.

A. Ineed to confer with --

MS. McCAWLEY: Yeah. I'm going to object.

BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. And that -- that's a fact -- that's not a
privileged question. That's a factual question.

A. Factual. Well, there are -- there are --

Q. Just how much money? You don't have to tell
me who the clients are. Just how much money?

A. Okay. I need to --

MR. SIMPSON: There's a question pending. I
object to a break. There's no possible
privilege.

MR. SCAROLA: He has a privilege -- he has a
privilege question. He wants to consult with
counsel.

MR. SIMPSON: Well, really? My question is
how much money, and that's privileged?

MR. SCAROLA: It may be. I don't know. We

THE WITNESS: That's why I need to --

MR. SCOTT: There's no federal law or state
law that supports that financial information and

MS. McCAWLEY: We can argue about that
because that's in my motion, so we can argue
about that.

Epstein then turned to his side and started to rub his penis in an

to massage Mary’s vaginal area.

himself down as he got off the table,” she says.

A. I think it puts you on notice in the context
of a country which has required people to report the
sexual abuse of children, and somebody wants to talk to
you about your observations of a convicted sex offender
with underage girls, that that's going to be one of the
subjects that's going to be discussed, yes.
Q. My question was -- my initial question was:
Does -- do the statements in this letter put the reader
on notice that you, personally, are accused of abusing
minors yourself, not that you have in some knowledge or
evidence that someone else did it, but that you,
yourself, did it; is that a way to give fair notice?
A. Well, in fair notice in what context? You
know, is he on notice that a lawsuit is going to be
filed the next day?
Simply from that piece of -- that letter
alone, they are on notice, you know -- I mean, I think
that puts you on notice that there are serious
allegations afoot and it would be in your best interest
if you hadn't done anything, to show up, attend a
deposition, let all the facts come out so that everybody
can know them.

Q. Would you agree that accusing someone of

themselves abusing a minor is different than accusing
someone of having knowledge that somebody else did it?

A. Yes.

Q. And to accuse someone of abusing a minor is a
serious, serious accusation of criminal conduct,
personal criminal conduct, not just failing to report
somebody else, but you, yourself, are abusing people?

A. Oh, yeah.

MR. SCAROLA: Are you suggesting that that's
not criminal conduct?
MR. SIMPSON: I'm -- I'm -- my question
stands.
BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. What is the answer to that?

A. Itis a very serious charge, I agree. That's
why we are all here today.

Q. Okay. And -- and if you wanted to put
someone on fair notice that they are accused themselves
of being a sex offender, a criminal who has abused
children, wouldn't you tell them that?

A. That's a speculative question because that
letter was designed to try to collect information about
an international sex trafficking organization. And so
as to -- you know, I'm not going to speculate as to why
Mr. Scarola wrote it that way. But my sense, based on
the public record is, that he was trying to get as much
information as he could about what Jeffrey Epstein and

his criminal associates were doing. And he thought that
Mr. Dershowitz would have information and was trying to
collect that.

Now, whether the -- the -- the tentacles of
the organization would extend so that they wrapped
around Mr, Dershowitz himself, I guess was the subject
that -- that Mr, Scarola, I am assuming, was hoping to
explore. But Mr, Dershowitz prevented that opportunity.

Q. And Mr. Dershowitz, you knew, had been
Mr. Epstein's attorney, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And you knew, just as we have seen here today
with multiple assertions of privilege, that he could not
testify about anything he learned as an attorney?

A. He could testify, and the fetter itself says,
we are not going to ask you about any communications; we
are going to ask you about observations of sex abuse by
a convicted sex offender, and your personal knowledge of
that. That would not have erased in the -- and
Mr. Scarola's a very good attorney, and I'm sure all of
his questions that we saw the last couple of days would
have been very narrowly focused on observations about
what this criminal organization was doing.

Q. And so to the bottom line is that your view,
your sworn testimony, this letter of August 23rd, 2011,

ESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS
(954) 331-4400

put Mr. Dershowitz, Professor Dershowitz, on fair notice
that he was being accused of being a sex offender
himself?

A. We-- we have gone over this. I think it put
him on fair notice that there were serious questions
being raised about what he knew about this criminal
organization, what the potential criminal responsibility
he had for failure to report sexual abuse of a child, as
well as other possibilities.

MR. SIMPSON: I'm going to move to strike as

nonresponsive.
BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. My question is a very narrow one, whether
this letter, in your opinion, under oath, fairly put
Mr. -- Professor Dershowitz on notice that he himself
was accused of abusing minors.

A. Again, that's a vague question, I've tried
to give the best answer I can. That was certainly a
potential area of questioning. I think that puts him on
notice that it would have been in his best interest to
appear to answer those questions.

MR. SIMPSON: I'm going to object to the

answer again as nonresponsive.
BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. It's a really simple question.

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026277.txt,"Crossfire’s progenitors thus ignored an obvious question: If Russia promised unspecified dirt on Mrs.
Clinton but never delivered it, how would that amount to collusion with the Trump campaign? If
anything, such behavior suggests an attempt to entice and potentially embarrass Mr. Trump by

dangling the prospect of compromising information and getting his aides to jump at it.

Given the paucity of evidence, it’s staggering that the FBI would initiate a counterintelligence
investigation, led by politically biased staff, amid a presidential campaign. The aggressive methods and
subsequent leaking only strengthen that conclusion. If the FBI sincerely believed Trump associates
were Russian targets or agents, the proper response would have been to inform Mr. Trump so that he

could protect his campaign and the country.

Mr. Trump’s critics argue that the claim of political bias is belied by the fact that Crossfire was not
leaked before the election. In fact, there were vigorous, successful pre-election efforts to publicize the
Trump-Russia collusion narrative. Shortly after Crossfire’s launch, CIA Director John Brennan and Mr.
Comey briefed Congress, triggering predictable leaking. Christopher Steele and his patrons embarked

on a media roadshow, making their dossier something of an open secret in Washington.

On Aug. 29, 2016, the New York Times published a letter to Mr. Comey from Senate Minority Leader
Harry Reid, saying he’d learned of “evidence of a direct connection between the Russian government
and Donald Trump’s presidential campaign,” which had “employed a number of individuals with
significant and disturbing ties to Russia and the Kremlin.” On Aug. 30, the ranking Democratic
members of four House committees wrote a public letter to Mr. Comey requesting “that the FBI assess
whether connections between Trump campaign officials and Russian interests” may have contributed
to the DNC hack so as “to interfere with the U.S. presidential election.” On Sept. 23, Yahoo News’s
Michael Isikoff reported the Hill briefings and the Steele dossier’s allegations regarding Carter Page.
On Oct. 30, Harry Reid again publicly wrote Mr. Comey: “In my communications with you and other
top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive
information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian

government.”

That these leaking efforts failed to prevent Mr. Trump’s victory, or that Mr. Comey’s ham-fisted
interventions might have also hurt Mrs. Clinton’s electoral prospects, does not diminish the legal

significance of the anti-Trump bias shown by government officials.

The totality of the circumstances creates the appearance that Crossfire was politically motivated. Since
an attempt by federal law enforcement to influence a presidential election “shocks the conscience,” any

prosecutorial effort derived from such an outrageous abuse of power must be suppressed. The public

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013118.txt,"202 11 Stages of Cognitive Development

A problem commonly used to illustrate the difference between the Piagetan concrete opera-
tional and formal stages is that of figuring out the rules for making pendulums swing quickly
versus slowly [P58]. If you ask a child in the formal stage to solve this problem, she may pro-
ceed to do a number of experiments, e.g. build a long string with a light weight, a long string
with a heavy weight, a short string with a light weight and a short string with a heavy weight.
Through these experiments she may determine that a short string leads to a fast swing, a long
string leads to a slow swing, and the weight doesn’t matter at all.

The role of experiments like this, which test “extreme cases,” is to make cognition easier. The
formal-stage mind tries to map a concrete situation onto a maximally simple and manipulable
set of abstract propositions, and then reason based on these. Doing this, however, requires an
automated and instinctive understanding of the reasoning process itself. The above-described
experiments are good ones for solving the pendulum problem because they provide data that
is very easy to reason about. From the perspective of uncertain inference systems, this is the
key characteristic of the formal stage: formal cognition approaches problems in a way explicitly
calculated to yield tractable inferences.

Note that this is quite different from saying that formal cognition involves abstractions and
advanced logic. In an uncertain logic-based AGI system, even infantile cognition may involve
these — the difference lies in the level of inference control, which in the infantile stage is simplistic
and hard-wired, but in the formal stage is based on an understanding of what sorts of inputs
lead to tractable inference in a given context.

11.4.4 The Reflexive Stage

In the reflexive stage (Figure 11.8), an intelligent agent is broadly capable of selfmodifying its
internal structures and dynamics.

As an example in the human domain: highly intelligent and self-aware adult humans may
carry out reflexive cognition by explicitly reflecting upon their own inference processes and
trying to improve them. An example is the intelligent improvement of uncertain-truth-value-
manipulation formulas. It is well demonstrated that even educated humans typically make
numerous errors in probabilistic reasoning [GGIK02]. Most people don’t realize it and continue
to systematically make these errors throughout their lives. However, a small percentage of
individuals make an explicit effort to increase their accuracy in making probabilistic judgments
by consciously endeavoring to internalize the rules of probabilistic inference into their automated
cognition processes.

In the uncertain inference based AGI context, what this means is: In the reflexive stage
an entity is able to include inference control itself as an explicit subject of abstract learning
(i.e. the ability to reason about one’s own tactical and strategic approach to modifying one’s
own learning and thinking), and modify these inference control strategies based on analysis of
experience with various cognitive approaches.

Ultimately, the entity can self-modify its internal cognitive structures. Any knowledge or
heuristics can be revised, including metatheoretical and metasystemic thought itself. Initially
this is done indirectly, but at least in the case of AGI systems it is theoretically possible to
also do so directly. This might be considered as a separate stage of Full Self Modification, or
else as the end phase of the reflexive stage. In the context of logical reasoning, self modification
of inference control itself is the primary task in this stage. In terms of inference control this

effectively hawking his secret sauce algorithm) and invest up to $5 million
with each. I knew paltry little about this and so rather found myself
identifying with the young women to whom Epstein was explaining the
basic math and mechanics—out of my league, but grateful for the lesson.

The Epstein house/office is, by careful design, exclusive and club like,
part hang out, part secret society. Along with the difficulty in explaining
why, even after his jail term, the rich and powerful have yet beaten a path to
his door, it’s also notable in the fixed hierarchy of who comes to whose turf,
that everybody, when they went to see Epstein, comes to him.

A week in late September, U.N. week as it happened, began, on
Sunday, at Epstein’s house with a colloquial for billionaires—Gates, TK,
TK, TK.

Epstein, preternaturally responsive to both the price of oil and to the
politics of the middle of East, entertained that evening a delegation from
Qatar, including Sheikh Hamad, the foreign minister. Hamad, indeed, lives
across the street in a similarly furnished house—he and Epstein have the
same decorator. Epstein, in his relaxed and amused demeanor, kept
prodding: “Why are you financing the bad guys? What do you get out of
that?”

The Qatarians, in some mild diplomatic discomfort, seemed most
worried that their bid for the World Cup might be compromised by bribery
allegations.

At 9:00 next morning, Epstein is joined for breakfast in the dining
room by Reid Weingarten, who’s represented among other fat cats in
trouble, Worldcom’s Bernie Ebbers and Goldman Sach’s Lloyd Blankfein.
Weingarten, horse, with a cold, and dejected, is just back from a failed
defense of former Connecticut Governor John Rowland. (Epstein: “You
actually believe he was getting fucked?” Weingarten: “From minute one.
I’m not a virgin. But his was the worst I’ve ever seen. It was like an
assassination. )

After a short discussion of the Qartarian’s visit—Epstein is serving
the chocolate, made from pistachios grown on the Shakes farm—and
speculation about who actually controls ISIS, I am asked to leave the room.
Twenty minutes later, after what ever business has been transacted or
particular confidences, shared I am asked back in.

“Why?” I asked Weingarten, when Epstein briefly steps out of the
room, “do some many people keep coming back here, everything
considered.”

private investigators who were then linked to local attorneys in Epstein’s employ. In one reported instance, the private
investigator claimed to be a police officer, and Reiter considered filing witness-tampering charges.

The credibility of the victims was also an issue; they had never complained of their treatment by Epstein until they
were contacted by police, and they may have voluntarily returned to the Palm Beach mansion several times. Many of
the girls came from disadvantaged backgrounds or broken homes, and they were susceptible to Epstein’s cash,
intimidation, and charm. Those who were 16 when they went to El Brillo Way would have been in their 20s by the time
they took the stand, and Epstein’s investigators had dredged up every instance of bad behavior in their pasts.
According to an exchange in the Reiter deposition, a few of the victims had worked in West Palm Beach at massage
parlors known as “jack shacks.” Each new compromising detail was immediately forwarded to the State Attorney's
Office, where staff met frequently with Epstein’s lawyers.

The Florida statutes are clear: Any person older than 24 who engages in sexual contact with someone under the age
| of 18 commits a felony of the second degree. The victim’s prior sexual conduct is not relevant; ignorance of her age is
| no defense. She needn't resist physically to cast doubt on the issue of “consent.” For a child under 16, even lewd
behavior short of touching is a felony of the second degree. But convincing a jury that a sexual encounter is a heinous
crime is difficult if the victim can be made to appear willing and unharmed, not to mention vulgar and mercenary. It
wasn’t hard to imagine some of the victims quickly being discredited in court by Epstein’s crack legal team, who
repeatediy noted that the age of consent is lower in many other states.

But that doesn’t quite explain why the Department of Justice would forgo the child-trafficking charges, which pertain
regardless of a girl’s attitude or character. Epstein’s final sentence is so out of line with the statutory guidelines for that
crime that it appears the department may have been influenced by the existence of his many powerful friends and
attorneys. A highly intelligent man who once taught math at the Dalton School in New York without a bachelor’s
degree, Epstein has been a serious and respected player in the highest reaches of politics and philanthropy. He has
made substantial contributions to political candidates, served on the Council on Foreign Relations, and donated $30
million to Harvard University.

Moreover, many of his high-powered acquaintances availed themselves of Epstein’s private jets, for which the pilot
logs, obtained by discovery in the civil suits, sometimes showed that bold-face names were on the same flights as
underage girls. A high-profile trial threatened to splash mud over all sorts of big players, just as both Gov. Richardson
and Bill Clinton’s wife were running for president. Also, a hedge fund prosecution in which Epstein offered to give
evidence was heating up. Alberto Gonzales, who was U.S. attorney general throughout most of the Epstein
investigation and resigned just before the non-prosecution agreement was signed, told The Daily Beast that he “would
have instructed the Justice Department to pursue justice without making a political mess.” But that may have been an
impossible mandate, given the players involved.

Instead, said attorney Brad Edwards, “Epstein committed crimes that should have jailed him for most of his life...he
was jailed for only a few months.” And this week he waiks through his door a free man.

G) Represents discretionary matching contributions under our 401(k) Plan

(i) The 2016 and 2017 amounts for Mr. Garcia is the incremental cost to Carvana of flights relating to a personal event on the private aircraft operated by
Bridgecrest Credit Company, f/k/a DT Credit Company, LLC (“Bridgecrest’’), an affiliate of DriveTime, and leased by Carvana. See “Certain
Relationships and Related Party Transactions — Relationship with DriveTime — Aircraft Time Sharing Agreement.” The incremental cost to Carvana
of aircraft used under the aircraft time sharing agreement for a non-business flight is calculated by multiplying the aircraft’s per-mile variable
operating cost by a flight’s total mileage, which includes the mileage of an empty return flight. Variable operating costs include: (1) landing, parking,
passenger ground transportation, crew travel, and flight planning services expenses; (2) supplies, catering, and crew traveling expenses; (3) aircraft
fuel and oil expenses; (4) maintenance, parts, and external labor (inspections and repairs); and (5) any customs, foreign permit, and similar fees. Fixed
costs that do not vary based upon usage are not included in the calculation of direct operating cost. On certain occasions, a named executive officer or
a named executive officer’s spouse or other family member may fly on the corporate aircraft as additional passengers. No additional direct operating
cost is incurred in such situations under the foregoing methodology because the costs would not be incremental. Carvana does not pay its named
executive officers any amounts in respect of taxes (so-called gross-up payments) on income imputed to them for non-business aircraft usage.

(iii) The incremental cost of the company car to us has been calculated based on the depreciation value of the vehicle.

(iv) Represents the cost of company-paid cell phone service.

(v) Mr. Garcia’s “All Other Compensation” for 2018 was less than $10,000.

For more than a decade, David Blaine has been attracting
the world’s attention with his high-profile endurance stunts.
Starting his career as a magician who appeared to do the
impossible with a deck of cards, he was soon following in the
footsteps of Houdini—seeking out that which seems physically
impossible and actually doing it. To that end, he’s been buried
alive in New York City for a week, barely survived being
encased inside a six-ton block of ice for three days and three
nights, stood atop a 100-foot-tall pillar in Bryant Park for 36
hours without a safety net, survived inside a transparent box in
London on nothing but water for 44 days, and spent one week
submerged in a sphere-shaped aquarium at Lincoln Center, at
the end of which he attempted to break the world record for
breath holding. A year later, he succeeded live on the Oprah
Winfrey show, holding his breath for 17 minutes and 4 seconds.
Born in Brooklyn, Blaine discovered his passion for
magic at the age of four when he saw a magician perform
in the subway. His mother encouraged his passion and he
began performing professionally at private parties by the age
of thirteen. By the age of twenty-three, Blaine had created,
directed, and produced an original television program titled
Street Magic, which garnered rave reviews by critics and

revolutionized the way magic is portrayed on television.
Penn Jillette of Penn & Teller called Street Magic “the best
TV magic special ever done” and “the biggest breakthrough
in our lifetime.” The New York Times noted that David has
“taken a craft that’s been around for hundreds of years

and done something unique and fresh with it.” The New
Yorker claimed that “he saved magic.” Since then, Blaine
has produced nine additional primetime specials.

Blaine has performed magic privately for U.S.
Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, Governor
Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bill Gates, Henry Kissinger, Mayor
Bloomberg, Mark Zuckerberg, and Muhammad Ali, as
well as President Dmitry Medvedev of Russia and other
international leaders. He also performed alongside Michael
Jackson, and during the Super Bowl halftime show.

In 2010, Blaine performed magic for 72 hours
straight in Times Square, raising nearly $100,000 for
relief efforts following the earthquake in Haiti.

Blaine resides in New York City with his
fiancée, Alizee Guinochet. The couple welcomed a
magical daughter into the world on January 27, 2011.

The masters and preachers of terror had told their foot soldiers, and
the great mass on the fence, that the Americans would make a run for
it—as they had in Lebanon and Somalia, that they didn't have the
stomach for a fight. The Arabs barely took notice when America
struck the Taliban in Kabul. What was Afghanistan to them? It was a
blighted and miserable land at a safe distance.

But the American war, and the sense of righteous violation, soon hit
the Arab world itself. Saddam Hussein may not have been the Arab
idol he was a decade earlier, but he was still a favored son of that
Arab nation, its self-appointed defender. The toppling of his regime,
some 18 months or so after 9/11, had brought the war closer to the
Arabs. The spectacle of the Iraqi despot flushed out of his spider hole
by American soldiers was a lesson to the Arabs as to the falseness and
futility of radicalism.

It is said that the east is a land given to long memory, that there the
past is never forgotten. But a decade on, the Arab world has little to
say about 9/1 1—at least not directly. In the course of that Arab
Spring, young people in Tunisia and Egypt brought down the dreaded
dictators. And in Libya, there is the thrill of liberty, delivered, in part,
by Western powers. In the slaughter-grounds of Syria, the rage is not
directed against foreign demons, but against the cruel rulers who
have robbed that population of a chance at a decent life.

America held the line in the aftermath of 9/11. It wasn't brilliant at
everything it attempted in Arab lands. But a chance was given the
Arabs to come face to face, and truly for the first time, with the
harvest of their own history. Now their world is what they make of it.

Before we filed our petition, I had received several phone calls from anti-capital punishment
lawyers imploring me not to file a petition for certiorari in the Tison case. “Count the noses,” one
of them warned. “You may not have five any more.” He urged me to leave well enough alone:
“We have Enmund. Most courts will follow Enmund and reverse felony-murder death sentences.
But if the Supremes take your case and reverse or limit Enmund, people will die because of you.
You have to go by the numbers.”

I understood his reference to “the numbers” as meaning two different things: First the numbers
on the Supreme Court, which now might be 5-4 against us. And the large number of condemned
inmates who faced execution on a theory similar to that which had lead the sentencing judge in
Arizona to sentence the Tison brothers to die even though they had not killed the Lyons family or
intended their death.

I respected the insights and judgments of the callers, but I had two clients on death row. I was
their lawyer, not the lawyer for the many other death row inmates whose fates could be adversely
determined by a negative ruling in our case. I cared deeply about the other inmates. I cared
deeply about every inmate facing the death penalty. I cared deeply about the issue itself. But I
could not allow these strong feelings to influence my decision regarding my clients. I was the
only person between them and the canisters of death that stood ready to end their young lives. At
that moment in time, I was not a “capital punishment lawyer” or a “cause” lawyer of any kind. I
was Ricky and Raymond Tison’s lawyer. I had to put case before cause, client before campaign,
the Tison brothers before the others on death row. It was an excruciating conflict, but not a
difficult legal or ethical decision.

I decided to file a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court. Our hope was that the justices
would not want to hear full argument on an issue they had so recently considered: namely the
constitutionality of the death penalty for defendants—like Enmund—who had not been the actual
triggerman in a crime that had resulted in the death of the victim. We hoped the justices would
simply “remand the case for reconsideration in light of Enmund.” In other words, that they would
send the case back to the Arizona courts so that those judges could apply the Enmund precedent
to the facts of the Tison case. That would have been the best of all possible worlds. The Court
would have reaffirmed Enmund as the binding precedent and sent a strong message to the state
courts to be sure to follow that precedent. And it would have saved the lives of Ricky and
Raymond. But it was not to be. To our disappointment and worry, the justices granted review
and set the case down for full briefing and argument.

Generally, lawyers are ecstatic when the High Court grants review of one of their cases. It means
that they will have the privilege of arguing before the Supreme Court—a rare honor that few
lawyers ever experience. It also means they will have an opportunity to influence the
development of constitutional law—a knife that cuts both ways, since the influence may be
positive or negative.

In this case, I was far from ecstatic, since the granting of review so soon after the divided decision
in Enmund signaled a desire on the part of at least some of the justices to reconsider and perhaps

reverse or limit Enmund. The last thing I wanted to be was the vehicle by which the justices

murders, we cont inue the denial by calling it “workplace violence.” He is the Civilization-Violent Jihad
combo! And we continue to enable the same infiltration elsewhere.

FP: Tell our readers about “The Project” and “Explanatory Memorandum.” These are realities that serve as
great threats to the Control Factor, right?

Siegel: These are separate sets of documents that outline the Muslim Brotherhood’s goals and

plans underlying the Civilization Jihad. The former was discovered in Europe and extends globally. The
1991 Explanatory Memorandum emerged in 2008 from the Holy Land Foundation trial and describes the
Brotherhood’s work in America as a “Civilization-Jihadist Process with all the word means” and “a kind of
grand Jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and ‘sabotaging’ its miserable
house by their own hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and God’s religion is made
victorious over all other religions.”

Much as the communists of the Soviet Union had formulated in the 1950s a detailed long term plan to
destroy America (many of the effects of which we are seeing of late including destroying the nuclear family,
secularizing the nation, feminizing men ...) these documents identify many strategies to infiltrate while
eroding the foundations of our civilization in order to transform it into an Islamic one. The Control Factor
has many ingenious ways to convince us that this is ridiculous, that our courts and system would never allow
such a thing, that one is racist or “Islamophobic,” if not insane, for even thinking this is real. And just as
with the communists, time is plentiful. Even more so with our Islamic Enemy, a multi-decade plan is short
term. It is not critical that a seriou sly engaged Muslim lives to see the result. It is critical, more correctly a
duty, however, that he carries on his Jihad. Patrick Poole and The Center for Security Policy’s Team B
Report, Shariah: The Threat to America, are excellent sources for your readers to pursue these documents.

FP: And so what you call an “Inner Jihad” has to start. It’s our, as you say, mandatory “addiction treatment.”
Please explain.

Siegel: The “Inner Jihad” is the effort we must undertake to gain control over our Control Factors. There is a
famous Hadith in which Mohammad, returning from a successful battle, essentially says that the physical
fight was the “lesser Jihad” and it is time to then attend to the “greater Jihad €”- that internal battle against
our own internal appetites, lusts, wrong thinking and so forth. While that Hadith has been falsely utilized to
say that “Jihad” is not violent, it is useful to us as a symbol of the vicious effort we must take internally
against our own Control Factor tendencies.

As I said earlier, the Control Factor is “active” and “continuous” so we must constantly monitor and combat
it. Like “Whack-a-Mole,” just as we may think we have addressed it, another variation pops right up. I use
the terms “addict” and “enabler” because we truly need a form of rehab to break the habitual power of the
Control Factor and because our relationship with our Islamic Enemy is very much like that between a typical
addict and his enabler. And just as it is so difficult for an addict to kick his habit, so does the enabler act
essentially addicted to his behavior and find it so difficult to change. At its core, the relati onship involves
the transfer of responsibility for our Islamic Enemy’s hate and resultant actions onto us with our response
framed essentially as an effort to do what we can to try to address the Enemy’s grievance. (Your book,
United in Hate, describes this addiction to hate in detail.

The key to the Inner Jihad is to learn to transfer responsibility for our Islamic Enemy’s hate and resultant
actions back to it and take responsibility back for our own situation. We must learn all we can about the
enemy. We must unwind our inappropriate projections and introjections and rediscover who we are and are
not. We must speak up. We must support those Muslims who promote expressions of Islam that are
consistent with our principles. And we must stalk the C ontrol Factor, constantly be on guard for its
intrusion. This is an individual endeavor as each of our Control Factors uses its own methods. The book
gives plenty of examples of each maneuver discussed but it is important for each of us to discover the unique
workings of his own mind. That takes the work of the Inner Jihad.

FP: Share with our readers what you mean by the “Turnaround Moment.”

Prince Andrew and girl, 17, who sex offender friend flew to Britain to meet him | Daily Mail Online

My father left and | was told to go upstairs.’ She was led by another woman through Epstein’s
bedroom into a massage room where he lay face down naked on a table.

He started to interviewed Virginia. This was unconventional, but Virginia had no suspicions.
Presumably, she thought, this was how the wealthy conducted their business.

Epstein elicited the information that Virginia had been a runaway, and was no longer a virgin.

Virginia was then told to start massaging Epstein, under the instructions of the woman who had
shown her in. The massage quickly developed into a sexual encounter.

Virginia was uncomfortable, but reluctant to deny such important people. ‘My face was red with
embarrassment,’ she says. ‘But | felt under immense pressure to please them.

The whole time it was going on, they were promising me the world, that I’d travel with Jeffrey on his
private jet and have a well-paid profession.’ Afterwards, she was given two $100 bills and told to
return the next day.

That was the beginning of the four years she spent with Epstein.

For three of those years, she was under Florida’s age of consent, which is 18.

Troubled teenager: Virginia on the billionaire's Zorro ranch in New Mexico in 2001

Virginia was fascinated by his life story: the son of a humble New York City parks worker, he was a
teacher before becoming a Wall Street broker and friends with the upper echelons of the political,
financial and academic establishment.

As a confused teenager, Virginia easily fell into the practice of sexually gratifying him for money.
He guaranteed her a minimum of $200 each time she gave him what he called an ‘erotic massage.’

Virginia said: ‘| would always receive the money immediately. He would give me the cash from a wad
he carried in a black duffel bag or an assistant paid me.

‘And, because of the way Epstein had warped her sensibilities, every time she took the cash,
Virginia felt even more indebted to him. Secretly, he was also preparing her for an even more
disturbing role.

‘Basically, | was training to be a prostitute for him 4 H
and his friends who shared his interest in young Epstein had trained me
girls,’ she says: ‘After about two years, he started to do whatever men

to ask me to “entertain” his friends.’

It started when Epstein called Virginia at the Pam Wanted. | told myself I
Beach apartment he had rented for her. .
was special

She recalls: ‘He said, “I’ve got a good friend and |
need you to fly to the island to
entertain him, massage him and make him feel how you make me feel.”

He didn’t spell out what | had to do. He didn’t have to. ‘He’d trained me to do whatever a man
wanted. | was shocked but | told myself he was sharing me around because he trusted me and | was
special.

| was worried, but | would do anything to keep Jeffrey happy and to keep my place as his number
one girl.

He would keep telling me how lucky | was with the life | was leading and the money | was making. It
was easy to fall into his grasp.

‘The way it usually worked was I’d be sent to meet a man on the private island Jeffrey owned in the
Caribbean, or at his ranch in New Mexico, which was really isolated.’ She was ‘given’ to men ranging
in age from their 40s to their 60s.

They included a well-known businessman (whose pregnant wife was asleep in the next room), a
world-renowned scientist, a respected liberal politician and a foreign head of state.

None appeared to think the arrangement was unusual. Virginia says there were many other girls in
Epstein’s circle and that she was paid extra money to help recruit them.

‘They would lounge around the Palm Beach house, the ranch or the island, nude or topless,’ she
says. ‘But | was one of the very few he trusted as “special” and chosen to “entertain” his friends.’

Virginia took the sedative Xanax to detach herself from sordid reality. ‘It was an escape drug,’ she
says. ‘It made me calm and helped me forget about what | had to do. | was up to eight pills a day.’

Epstein had no objection to Virginia’s use of prescription drugs, no doubt recognising that they made
her even more malleable. ‘I didn’t want to go back to the life I'd had before’ she says.

‘That made me totally obedient.’ Despite the fact that Epstein was, essentially, her pimp, this life now
seemed normal to Virginia. ‘I felt that he and Ghislaine really cared for me,’ she said.

control of something like 40 percent of the West Bank. That meant — at least in
theory — that Israel could limit phase-three to a mere token pullout, leaving the
Palestinians with less than half of the territory.

“T don’t know what percentage, exactly,” I replied. “But one of my cabinet
ministers thinks that a formula of 70-10-20 would work, meaning 70 percent for
the Palestinians, ten percent to allow us to retain and secure the largest of the
settlement blocs, and the rest to be worked out in further talks.”” When he nodded, I
added: “Peres thinks it could end up at 80-20, and says he thinks Arafat would find
it hard to walk away from getting control of four-fifths of the West Bank. But it’s
not about the number. It’s about the area needed for the major settlements, and
whatever else is required to safeguard our security. Beyond that, we don’t need a
single inch of the West Bank, and we won’t ask for a single inch.”

I replied in much the same vein when President Clinton urged me to help kick-
start new talks with Assad by formally reaffirming Yitzhak’s “pocket deposit” on
the Golan Heights. As with the Palestinians, I was not going to cede a major
negotiating card — our only real negotiating card — before we had any indication
Assad was serious about making peace. But I did feel it was necessary to reassure
Clinton that / was serious. I told him that, if and when the Syrians showed real
signs of readiness to address our needs in a peace agreement, I would reaffirm the

“pocket deposit.”

I’d come to Washington hoping that President Clinton would be with me on the
main issues of substance. But what I needed most at this point was his support on
the procedural decisions I’d made in order to get to real peace negotiations:
engaging with Syria first, and shifting the emphasis on the Palestinian track away
from the redeployments toward the core permanent-status issues we’d have to
resolve in order to get a peace agreement. What emerged from my first meetings
with President Clinton was essentially a trade-off. He knew I would be ready to
make concessions in pursuit of genuine peace. I was confident that on the route
that I was proposing to take, he would have my back.

But what I couldn’t be sure of was whether my own government would have
my back. On paper, we had a comfortable Knesset majority: 75 out of the 120
seats. But I knew it was inherently vulnerable, both to friction between the
Orthodox parties and assertively secular MKs from Meretz and inside Labor, and
to possible defections over the concessions we might have to consider in peace

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014558.txt,"Overweight US Energy Infrastructure Master
Limited Partnerships (MLPs): We initiated a
direct allocation to energy MLPs in late January
2016 and have maintained that tilt. Given our
assumptions about oil prices, we believe that the
cash distributions from MLPs are generally secure
and provide a yield to investors of just over 7%.
In the absence of any valuation changes, the yield
translates into a high single-digit tax-advantaged
return. Any growth in cash flow distribution or
improvements in valuation relative to the S&P 500
would provide some upside.

Overweight Spanish Equities: We maintain an
overweight to Spanish equities on a currency-
hedged basis. This tactical tilt was introduced in
August 2013, and we have adjusted the size of
the overweight about a dozen times since. Spanish
equities offer some of the cheapest valuations
across the developed markets, attractive dividend
yields, expected earnings growth of 4.6%, aided
by healthy domestic growth, and a particularly
well-capitalized® banking sector that has a lower
nonperforming loan ratio than the Eurozone bank
average. Furthermore, Spain is unlikely to face the
same political uncertainty as Germany, France and
Italy in 2017. We expect high single-digit returns
for Spanish equities.

Short Five-Year German Bunds: We recommend

a short position in five-year German bunds as

the ECB embarks upon the process of shifting

its monetary policy. After the December 2016
meeting, the ECB announced that it would reduce
its monthly purchases of bonds from €80 billion to
€60 billion starting in March 2017 and continuing
through December 2017. We expect the ECB to
end all purchases sometime in 2018, barring any
shocks. As a result, we think interest rates for
Eurozone sovereign debt will rise gradually over
the course of the year, which in the case of German
bunds means they will become less negative. We
expect a modest 2% return from this tilt.

Short Chinese Renminbi: We have increased our
bearish position on the Chinese renminbi over

the course of 2016. China is under pressure from
multiple sides: the need for loose monetary policy
to achieve the leadership’s 6.5% target GDP
growth rate, 32 months of capital outflows that
have accelerated in late 2016, a strong dollar and
an incoming Trump administration that will likely

pursue a US-centric policy toward China. Risks are
exacerbated by the leadership’s lack of experience
in handling financial market volatility, as evidenced
by China’s policy response to its equity market
collapse in June 2015 and its approach to shifting
the currency regime to a more flexible one in
August 2015 and January 2016. We expect the
currency to depreciate about 7% in 2017; since
4% is already priced in the forward markets, we
expect a return of about 3%. There is considerable
scope for further upside from this tilt if China
abandons its current control of the currency,

a move that could lead to depreciation in the
renminbi of about 20%.

Our tactical tilts are based on above-trend growth
of 2.3% in the US, global growth of 2.9%,
generally favorable monetary policy and more
stimulative fiscal policy across developed and
emerging market countries. We expect returns to
be muted across asset classes, resulting in modest
returns in a diversified portfolio with a modest
enhancement from tactical tilts. Of course, our
views are not without risks. As we discuss below,
some are low-probability risks with the potential
for high impact while others are high-probability
risks with low impact potential.

The Risks to Our Outlook

When we think about the risks to our economic
and financial market outlook, we are reminded of
the words of French writer Jean-Baptiste Alphonse
Karr: Plus ca change, plus c’est la méme chose—the
more things change, the more they stay the same.
This year’s list of risks overlaps with those of the
last several years. As far back as 2011, investors
have worried about a hard landing in China. From
the inception of the European sovereign debt
crisis in 2010 through the Brexit vote in 2016, the
potential breakup of the Eurozone has been a source
of concern. As soon as the Federal Reserve raised
the federal funds rate in December 2015, investors
worried about tightening policy causing a recession.
Cybersecurity and terrorism are constant threats.
And geopolitical risks have grown over time. This
year, we are adding trade policy uncertainty and US-
China geopolitical relations as new risks.

As we said in our 2013 Outlook, there is no
shortage of concerns as markets climb a wall
of worry. In our view, there are eight risks that

Hawaii. Nor would that data be forthcoming from Snowden, who
may be the only witness to the crime. By June 23, he was in a safe
haven in Moscow. Even though the grand jury case against Snowden
was cut and dry, it was also irrelevant because the United States does
not have an extradition treaty with Russia.

The purpose of the intelligence investigation went far beyond
determining Snowden’s guilt or innocence, however. Its job was to
find out how such a massive theft of documents could occur, how the
perpetrator escaped, and, perhaps most urgent, who had obtained the
unaccounted-for stolen documents from Snowden.

In his interviews with journalists in Moscow, Snowden studiously
avoided describing the means by which he breached the security
aperture of America’s most secret intelligence service. He only told
the journalists who came to Moscow to interview him, with a bit of
pseudo-modesty, that he was not “an angel” who descended from
heaven to carry out the theft. But the question of how Snowden
stole these documents may be the most important part of the story.
The NSA, after all, furnishes communications intelligence to the

© president, his national security advisers, and the Department of ©
Defense, intelligence that is supposedly derived from secret sources
in adversary nations. If these adversary nations learn about the
NSA’s sources, then the information, if not worthless, cannot be
fully trusted. The most basic responsibility of the NSA is to pro-
tect its sources. Yet Snowden walked away with long lists of them.
In doing so, he amply demonstrated that a single civilian employee
working for an outside contractor, even one not having the neces-
sary passwords and other access privileges, could steal documents
that betrayed these vital sources. He also demonstrated that such a
massive theft could go undetected for at least two weeks.

If Snowden managed this feat on his own, as he claims in his
Hong Kong video, it suggests that any other civilian employee with
a perceived grievance against NSA practices or American foreign
policy could also walk away with some of the most precious secrets
held by U.S. intelligence. Such vulnerability extends to tens of thou-
sands of civilian contract employees in positions similar to the one
held by Snowden. The lone disgruntled employee explanation is
therefore hardly reassuring. If true, it calls into question the entire

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025030.txt,"believe that the threat is under our control, when in fact it is not. Kindly enlighten us as to these profound
insights you make in terms of the Control Factor.

Siegel: First, let’s distinguish the ”real world” where real battles are taking place from the mental battlefield
which occurs in each of our minds. We tend to believe our perceptions are simply clear realizations of what
is “out there” and overlook how much our internal worlds can literally determine what we see. When our
internal minds become anxious and sense a loss of “control,” they tend to concoct ways to distort our
perceptions so as to restore that sense of inner control. I describe the Control Factor as an “active and
continuous process” designed to maintain that sense, if not illusion, of control. We natural ly think that our
thinking and feeling processes are passive; that they just happen. Yet when faced with truly frightening
prospects, the mind is geared to actively distort.

Similarly, the sense of control must be continuously maintained so the Control Factor operates constantly.
In turn, the sum of this active and continuous undertaking makes these perceptions all the more familiar and
thus seemingly all the more “real.” In one sense, the Control Factor is the mechanism of what Andy
McCarthy entitled one of his numerous excellent books- willful blindness. The Control Factor is cleverer
than we are aware; that is almost tautological as, if our minds are to create ways to keep us in denial, they
must out maneuver our conscious thinking.

Since World War II, America has had limited experience with threats coming to the homeland. Most of
America’s history has been about “over there,” where we have always known that if things got too out of
hand (e.g. Vietnam) we could always ret urn home. The current generations, for a wide array of reasons,
have had virtually no experience with a threat to this land. (The documentary, Generation Zero, is
interesting on this point).

Consequently, the process of waking up to such a threat parallels the arc of a typical horror film. In such a
film, there is typically a cast of characters surrounding one or two main characters. We in the audience
know there is a threat coming — be it a monster, a virus, a psycho killer, an alien, the blob that ate
Cincinnati etc. This threat is typically defined by its intent- the singular goal of destroying the characters.
Much of the initial exposition shows how the characters first are oblivious to the destruction the threat
brings about, then explain it in familiar terms only to finally open their eyes to see that something uniquely
terrifying is happening. The next stage usually involves a series of failed attempts to deal with the threat- fr
om trying to negotiate with it, to appease it, to coax it, to threaten it with ineffective weapons and so forth.
Most of these failings are due to not adequately appreciating the threat for what it truly is and projecting
onto it a host of other attributes instead. The final stage generally involves a back-up-against-the-wall
decision by whichever characters remain alive. I named this the “turnaround moment” when the character
becomes willing to be as ruthless as the threat. That change in mental state is necessary to ensure survival.
Ultimately, the storyline is a race for whichever characters remain to wake up fully and use whatever
advantages they may still have to beat the threat.

This is the same arc our minds go through in battling our own Control Factors, our own compulsions to
deny that which is staring us in the face. Ultimately, the question is whether we will be able to wake up
while we still have advantages and give ourselves permis sion to fully fight the battle we are in.

I said ear lier that there is a structure to the Control Factor. To oversimplify, I view it much as a pyramid
where on the bottom are the many minute by minute thoughts that are manipulated. I call this level of
maneuvers the many ”D’s” as they include the psychological defenses such as distortion, denial,
demonization, deflection, deletion, detachment, delusion, displacement, discolorization and so forth.
Layered upon these are moves such as projection, where we can assign to our Islamic Enemy traits we wish
to see in them or introject traits from them into ourselves that we wish not to acknowledge. These
maneuvers involve a mixing of identities where we actually lose clarity about who we are and who the
enemy is. Projection and introjection are active almost across the board. It is always helpful, for instance, to
ask how what the enemy accuses us of is more appropriately descriptive of it. When we add Western Guilt
and Shame, our need to be liked, and o ther psychological dimensions, basic thoughts solidify into larger
fantasies.

How Obama Blew the Chance for Economic Peace
by Mitchell Bard

Iln 2009, Barack Obama had an
unprecedented opportunity to advance the
peace process between Israel and the
Palestinians. For the first time, the
Palestinians had a prime minister who was
respected and admired by the Israelis,
because he did not come from the same
terrorist background as Yasser Arafat and
Mahmoud Abbas. Unlike his ideological -
comrades who insisted on “liberating Palestine,” Salam Fayyad, was
interested in building the infrastructure for a future state,
strengthening the West Bank economy, and improving the lives of the
Palestinian people.

depressed rats.

Freud’s last paper, Analysis, Terminable and Interminable (1939), featured
examples of what he perceived to be the unsolvable mystery of helpless
psychological entrapment in repetitious patterns of self-destructive behavior. He
blamed the lliad’s and Odyssey’s villainous immortal, Thanatos, the ever-
threatening spirit of death and destruction to contrast with the good, life giving Eros.
The Yiddish word for a personified Thanatos is Moloch ha-Moves. A range of
fixations in self-excitatory, repetitious, self-mutilating behaviors is documented in
domesticated animals. Dogs, particularly German Shepherds and Labrador
Retrievers, can lock up in compulsive grooming cycles of what is called acral lick in
which endless licking of paws or flanks lead to the break down of skin into seeping-
sore dermatitis, which, in turn, stimulates more licking.

Mark Twain wrote a story about his getting stuck in ceaseless mental
repetitions of a catchy, clangy poem. He could not stop reciting it to himself even
after days of sleep loss and anorexia. He was finally cured by relating his problem
and the poem to his pastor who he then unwittingly heard creating a community
epidemic by including the rhyme in his following Sunday’s sermon. Psychologists,
who study this form of human mental limit cycle attacks, call this state of internal,
repetitiously recited, poetic stuckness, earworms.

There are additional invariants of sudden transformations into spiritual-mind-
brain bifurcations into a limit cycle lockups and, as discussed, one of them is
psychological splitting. |n psychoanalytic theory, as first suggested by Freud in his
1937 written and posthumously published paper, Splitting of the Ego in the Process
of Defense (1940), splitting implies two simultaneous and contrary psychological
reactions, one can be conscious and the other unconscious. They can both emerge
in conflictual situations involving adaptive efforts of the personality to deal with the
opposition between some form of powerful instinctual pressure and attendant
perceived or imagined danger. Otto Fenichel’s Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis
(1950) elucidates multiple manifestations of splitting of the | (more technically, the

ego) into a conscious part that knows reality versus an unconscious part that denies

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016367.txt,"Computers, as a Tool for Creativity, Can’t Replace the Artist.

Rachel Rose, a video artist who thinks about the questions posed by AI, employs
computer technology in the creation of her works. Her films give the viewer an
experience of materiality through the moving image. She uses collaging and layering of
the material to manipulate sound and image, and the editing process is perhaps the most
important aspect of her work.

She also talks about the importance of decision making in her work. For her, the
artistic process does not follow a rational pattern. In a converation we had, together with
the engineer Kenric McDowell, at the Google Cultural Institute, she explained this by
citing a story from theater director Peter Brook’s 1968 book The Empty Space. When
Brook designed the set for his production of 7he Tempest in the late 1960s, he started by
making a Japanese garden, but then the design evolved, becoming a white box, a black
box, a realistic set, and so on. And in the end, he returned to his original idea. Brook
writes that he was shocked at having spent a month on his labors, only to end at the
beginning. But this shows that the creative artistic process is a succession whose every
step builds on the next and which eventually comes to an unpredictable conclusion. The
process is not a logical or rational succession but has mostly to do with the artist’s
feelings in reaction to the preceding result. Rose said, of her own artistic decision
making:

It, to me, is distinctively different from machine learning, because at each
decision there’s this core feeling that comes from a human being, which has to do
with empathy, which has to do with communication, which has to do with
questions about our own mortality that only a human could ask.

This point underlines the fundamental difference between any human artistic production
and so-called computer creativity. Rose sees AI more as a possible way to create better
tools for humans:

A place I can imagine machine learning working for an artist would be not in
developing an independent subjectivity, like writing a poem or making an image,
but actually in filling in gaps that are to do with labor, like the way that
Photoshop works with different tools that you can use.

And though such tools may not seem spectacular, she says, “they might have a larger
influence on art,” because they provide artists with further possibilities in their creative
work.

McDowell added that he, too, believes there are false expectations around AI.
“Tve observed,” he said, “that there’s a sort of magical quality to the idea of a computer
that does all the things that we do.” He continued: “There’s almost this kind of demonic
mirror that we look into, and we want it to write a novel, we want it to make a film—we
want to give that away somehow.” He is instead working on projects wherein humans
collaborate with the machine. One of the current aims of AI research is to find new
means of interaction between humans and software. And art, one could say, needs to
play a key role in that enterprise, since it focuses on our subjectivity and on essential
human aspects like empathy and mortality.

evaluations at $1,500.00 a pop. I was earning $7.50 per hour at the time. I didn't go.

I got up my nerve and talked to my mother, who had been extremely helpful and caring
when I came out to her about BDSM. During the BDSM conversation, I'd been scared --
then I felt immense relief as Mom told me that there was nothing wrong with me, and
reassured me that I wasn't giving up my liberation. When it came to orgasms, though,
she seemed unsure of what to say. She did at least tell me that she, too, couldn't come
easily, which made me feel a little better.

Most helpful was the therapist I found on the Kink Aware Professionals list -- an online
list of doctors, lawyers, and other professionals who believe they understand alternative
sexualities such as BDSM. I tried one therapist who didn't seem to get it, but the second
therapist I saw was wonderful. He helped me through an enormous amount of my BDSM
anxiety. The orgasm problem was thornier, but he didn't make any assumptions, and he
did listen carefully, which was more than most people did.

My therapist gently encouraged me to get a second opinion about my how my body
worked, from a new gynecologist. Irrationally, I didn't. I suppose I still felt crushed by
how the first gynecologist had reacted. I also hoped I'd learn to come as I explored
BDSM more -- which turned out to be true.

VIL. Figuring It Out

In retrospect, I recognize that I went through a brief period where I had orgasms
sometimes -- weak ones. But the orgasms were hard to hang on to because they happened
during sex with my boyfriend. This would be the same boyfriend I described at the
beginning of this piece, when I wrote: now I have the best boyfriend I've ever had. but
just like every other one, he can't get me off. big dick? oral sex? tons of foreplay? kink?
it's all there.

Now I see, in retrospect, that not everything was there: neither of us had questioned our
sexual assumptions, our societally-determined sexual scripts. And one of the biggest
sexual scripts is that sex ends with the man's orgasm. That the man's orgasm is the goal.

It's very hard to think around these scripts. It's very hard to even be aware of them. So,
since my paramount goal during sex was obviously satisfying my man,” I often pushed
my orgasm away due to my focus on him. I knew that if I came then I'd feel tired and less
interested in sex (at least for a while). And obviously, if he were to have his all-important
manly orgasm, I couldn't go falling asleep on him could I? I couldn't even pause to
mentally process my sensations if he seemed to be enjoying himself, now could I? Plus,
once he'd come, I certainly couldn't expect him to stimulate me any more than he already
had, because he was tired; he'd just had an orgasm!

(These days, one of my #1 judgments of whether a new partner could be good for me is
this: if I didn't come before he did, then does he take a moment post-orgasm to catch his
breath, and then turn to me and smile and offer to do what it takes?)

In the end, figuring it out was almost anticlimactic.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016401.txt,"Over nearly four decades, Stephen Wolfram has been a pioneer in the development and
application of computational thinking and responsible for many innovations in science,
technology and business.

His 1982 paper “Cellular Automata as Simple Self-Organizing Systems,” written
at the age of twenty-three, was the first of numerous significant scientific contributions
aimed at understanding the origins of complexity in nature.

It was around this time that Stephen briefly came into my life. I had established
The Reality Club, an informal gathering of intellectuals who met in New York City to
present their work before peers in other disciplines. (Note: In 1996, The Reality Club
went online as Edge.org). Our first speaker? Stephen Wolfram, a “wunderkind” who
had arrived in Princeton at the Institute for Advanced Study. I distinctly recall his
focused manner as he sat down on a couch in my living room and spoke uninterrupted for
about an hour before the assembled group.

Since that time, Stephen has become intent making the world’s knowledge easily
computable and accessible. His program Mathematica is the definitive system for
modern technical computing. Wolfram|Alpha computes expert-level answers using AI
technology. He considers his Wolfram Language to be the first true computational
communication language for humans and AIs.

I caught up with him again four years ago, when we arranged to meet in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, for a freewheeling conversation about Al. Stephen walked
in, said hello, sat down, and, looking at the video camera set up to record the
conversation for Edge, began to talk and didn’t stop for two and a half hours.

The essay that follows is an edited version of that session, which was a Wolfram
master class of sorts and is an appropriate way to end this volume—just as Stephen’s
Reality Club talk in the ’80s was a great way to initiate the ongoing intellectual
enterprise whose result is the rich community of thinkers presenting their work to one
another and to the public in this book.

thinking, this is a cognitive precedent to being able to reconsider an entire belief system, one
that has had contractual logic built atop reflexive adherence that began in early development.
If the initial moral system is viewed as positive and stable, then this cognitive capacity is
seen as dangerous and scary, but if early morality is stunted or warped, then this ability is
seen as enlightened. However, achieving this cognitive stage does not mean one automatically
changes their belief systems, but rather that the mental machinery is in place to consider
the possibilities. Because many people do not reach this level of cognitive development in the
area of moral and ethical thinking, it is associated with negative traits (“moral relativism”
and “flip-flopping”). However, this cognitive flexibility generally leads to more sophisticated and
applicable moral codes, which in turn leads to morality which is actually more stable because
it is built upon extensive and deep consideration rather than simple adherence to reflexive or
rationalized ideologies.

12.4.2 Stages of Development of Empathic Ethics

Complementing Kohlberg’s logic-and-justice-focused approach, Carol Gilligan’s [Gil82] “ethics
of care” model is a moral development theory which posits that empathetic understanding
plays the central role in moral progression from an initial self-centered modality to a socially
responsible one. The ethics of care model is concerned with the ways in which an individual
cares (responds to dilemmas using empathetic responses) about self and others. As shown in
Table 12.3, the ethics of care is broken into the same three primary stage as Kohlberg, but with
a focus on empathetic, emotional caring rather than rationalized, logical principles of justice.

Stage Principle of Care

Pre-Conventional Individual Survival

Conventional Self Sacrifice for the Greater Good

Post-Conventional Principle of Nonviolence (do not hurt others, or oneself)

Table 12.3: Gilligan’s Stages of the Ethics of Care

For an “ethics of care” approach to be applied in an AGI, the AGI must be capable of internal
simulation of other minds it encounters, in a similar manner to how humans regularly simulate
one another internally. Without any mechanism for internal simulation, it is unlikely that an
AGI can develop any sort of empathy toward other minds, as opposed to merely logically
or probabilistically modeling other agents’ behavior or other minds’ internal contents. In a
CogPrime context, this ties in closely with how CogPrime handles episodic knowledge — partly
via use of an internal simulation world, which is able to play “mental movies” of prior and
hypothesized scenarios within the AGI system’s mind.

However, in humans empathy involves more than just simulation, it also involves sensorimotor
responses, and of course emotional responses — a topic we will discuss in more depth in Appendix
?? where we review the functionality of mirror neurons and mirror systems in the human brains.
When we see or hear someone suffering, this sensory input causes motor responses in us similar
to if we were suffering ourselves, which initiates emotional empathy and corresponding cognitive
processes.

demolition permit had been issued for this property on November 11, 2007 with a
final inspection of February 15, 2008. There was a building permit initially issued
on the site which stayed the requirement to seed and irrigate. The building permit
had since been rescinded by the contractor which meant it was no longer a
construction site and the lot had to be maintained. He had numerous meetings
with the property owner and the property manager who was present to speak
today if necessary. Mr. Walton said that as of yesterday, an irrigation system had
been installed and the property had been hydro-seeded. They are now in
compliance with the ordinance. The violation was not corrected prior to the time
specified but was corrected prior to the hearing. The Town recommends the
Board find the violation occurred but has been corrected, assess administrative
costs in the amount of $150.00 and no further fines be imposed and the case
closed.

MOTION BY MS. DUEMLER TO FIND THE VIOLATION OCCURRED
BUT HAS BEEN CORRECTED AND ASSESS ADMINISTRATIVE
COSTS OF $150.00

SECONDED BY MR. KOEPPEL

MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY

H. Case # 08-2484, 515 N. County Road, Trump Properties, LLC
Violation of Chapter 18, Section 18-205 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of
Ordinances, the Architectural Commission may attach conditions to any approval
it grants (Declaration of Use Agreement).

Lead Code Enforcement Walton presented the facts of the case and said the
previous owner of the property, Abe Gosman, had been granted approval by the
Architectural Commission to do some remodeling. One of the conditions of this
approval was that the hedge along the front of the property be maintained in the
condition it was in at the time the approval was granted. This agreement was a
binding agreement, which passes on to any subsequent property owner. The
agreement was made January 31, 1990. The subsequent buyer of this property
was Mr. Trump, Trump Properties, LLC and some remodeling work was done,
removing the previous hedge. A new hedge was planted to replace the original
hedge and that one has now been removed. This is a violation of the agreement. A
letter was received from Mr. Royce, representing Mr. Trump, asking for a
postponement of today’s hearing. The Town does not feel this matter should be
postponed.

Mr. Randolph summarized the letter from Mr. Royce which indicated the ficus
hedge keeps dying and they want to replace it with something different. They plan
on hiring a landscape architect to go before the next Architectural Commission
meeting to get approval to install a hedge in an attempt to meet the conditions of
the declaration of use agreement. Mr. Randolph said he had discussions with Mr.
Royce and Mr. Walton and Mr. Royce was told the Town could not recommend a
postponement and the recommendation would be that they are found in violation,
assessed the $150.00

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012096.txt,"The Original Big Short

The Amsterdam Stock Exchange, founded by the Dutch
East India Company in 1602, is recognized as the world’s
oldest stock exchange. It facilitated a secondary market to
trade stocks and gave rise to trading clubs during the mid-
17: century where speculators would congregate.
Messengers would rush to and from the exchange to
update pricing to customers.

In 1867, the invention of the stock-
ticker machine, also known as the
ticker tape, obviated the need for
messengers. Stock transaction data
was transmitted by telegraph to a
ticker tape that would continuously
print out abbreviated company
names (ticker symbols) followed by the price and volume
data. Thomas Edison later upgraded the system to reach
a printing speed of one character per second. Ticker tape
eliminated the need for messengers and allowed people to
trade in “real time” from long distance.

In 1900, 14 year-old Jesse Lauriston Livermore started
working as a quotation board boy in the Boston office of
Paine Webber. His job was to update the board with
information coming off the ticker tape. He became
interested in the behavior of stock prices and began
recording price movements that enabled him to spot
patterns prior to sizeable advances and declines. A fellow
office boy later talked him into speculating on a stock on
margin at a bucket shop. Two days later, Jesse sold the
position with a $3.12 profit. He soon quit his job and
started trading for a living.

Jesse made his first $1,000 (around $27,600 in today’s
dollars) at the age of 15. He was later banned by most
bucket shops in Boston as he had outfoxed many of the
shady operators. By the age of 20, he had accumulated
$10,000. Then came the big payday — the Panic of 1907 —
during which Jesse shorted the market and made $1
million ($25 million in today’s dollars). He would top this
feat and live up to the reputation as “The Great Bear of
Wall Street” by shorting the market in 1929 for an
astounding $100 million profit ($1.43 billion in 2017!),
making him one of the richest men in the world.

The combination of elevated
investor complacency and a

tightening Fed makes the

market vulnerable to a pullback.

Unfortunately, the concept of diversification probably
never crossed Jesse’s mind. He somehow managed to lose
all his money and was bankrupt by 1934. The bankruptcy
resulted in an automatic suspension of his membership
on the Chicago Board of Trade. In 1940, the legendary
trader, suffering from depression, shot himself in the
cloak room of Manhattan’s Sherry-Netherland Hotel.

Rise of the Machines

How things have changed from
those simpler days when humans
were doing the trading. Today,
with the advent of technology,
market activity is dominated by
passive and various quantitative
strategies. It is estimated that
fundamental discretionary investors now account for only
10% of the trading volume. Big inflow into major ETFs
prompted buying across the board regardless of company
specific issues and valuations. Big data and machine
learning are the new buzz words. Forbes recently featured
a quant fund run by three twenty-somethings. Their
assets under management was in the low tens of millions
of dollars, yet they averaged $1 billion in transactions, or
10,000 to 40,000 trades each day. Since there are only
86,400 seconds in a day, this fund would generate a trade
every 2.16 to 8.64 seconds if it worked around the clock.
Much of the decision making and trade execution, of
course, has been taken over by software algorithms. These
whiz kids employed statistical arbitrage trading strategies
in stocks and currencies, and closed out all trading
positions at the end of each day.

The allure of sophisticated computer models trouncing
their human competitors has continued to attract inflow
to quant funds. It is estimated that quantitative hedge
funds now manage more than $1 trillion, about one-third
of the $3 trillion hedge fund industry. While there are
indeed brilliant quant managers who have delivered
strong returns over a long period of time, the sheer size of
the industry means there are likely more pretenders than
contenders. Given that many funds employ similar
strategies (e.g., trend following), a reversal in trend could
create disruptive market movements, not to mention the
threat of rogue algorithms wreaking havoc on the market.

The SinoVision/Qiaobao story is illustrative of Beijing’s push to dominate Chinese-
language media in the United States. SinoVision, Qiaobao, and the Sino American Times
(= 3HET#R) all belong to the Asian Culture and Media Group (2 B= WIL SB).
Sources in these firms say that the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State Council
of PRC (FEHB BiB iH 4) set up the firm in the early 1990s but hid its financial role

in these companies.

All the major executives of these firms appear to have been either appointed directly

or approved by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office.*? Most of the major executives

and editors in these businesses served either as editors or reporters for the China News
Service or in the Overseas Chinese Office of the State Council. The group’s flagship
newspaper, Qiaobao, is divided into two divisions: the Western US Qiaobao (RHE id)
and the Eastern United States. Qiaobao (2H Arik). The president of the Western division
is also the chairman of the board of directors of Rhythm Media Group, a corporation
that consists of Qigobao and a few other media outlets, including radio stations in
Seattle and elsewhere.”? The chairman worked for the official China News Service (#
#4) for many years as a reporter before coming to the United States to establish the
Western US Qiaobao in the 1990s. The China News Service is a branch of the Overseas
Chinese Affairs Office. In 2015, the service described the work of the top executives of
the Eastern US Qiaobao’s (27 HF48) work as part of the PRC’s broader push to strengthen
its “soft power” and fight back against “Western media hegemony.”*? Qiaobao is the

sole major newspaper to use simplified Chinese characters in an effort to appeal to
immigrants from mainland China living abroad. Almost all the news stories in Qiaobao
about China, the Sino-US relationship, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and other important issues
important to China are taken directly from official Chinese media outlets or websites,
including CCTV, Xinhua, and the People’s Daily. Its current editor is I-Der Jeng, and in an
email communication with Foreign Policy magazine, he stated that the paper receives no
editorial direction from Beijing.** However, like its parent company, numerous reporters

and editors on the paper come from China’s state-owned press outlets.?°

The group’s main TV outlet is SinoVision. It operates two twenty-four-hour channels
(one Chinese and one English language), and it is on the program lineups of cable
systems covering about thirty million people. SinoVision’s website (http://www

its sister newspapers, SinoVision was established in 1990 as part of the PRC’s first push

Coca-Cola Co., 578 F.3d 1252, 1258 n.5 (11th Cir. 2009) (allowing TVPA action against corporate defendant), and
Khulumani, 504 F.3d at 260, with Mohamad v. Rajoub, 634 F.3d 604, 607-08 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (holding that TVPA liability
does not extend to non-natural persons), and Aziz v. Alcolac, Inc., 658 F.3d 388, 392 (4th Cir. 2011) (same), and Bowoto v.
Chevron Corp., 621 F.3d 1116, 1126-27 (9th Cir. 2010) (same). In the interest of judicial economy, plaintiffs respectfully
request that this Court defer deciding their appeal of the dismissal of ther TVPA claims until the Supreme Court has decided
Mohamad and the Court can obtain the benefit thereafter of the parties’ views of the implications of that decision for this
case.

Alternatively, should Mohamad not result in an opinion or if this Court is inclined to reach a decision on the TVPA claims
independently of Mohamad, it should vacate the district court’s dismissals. The TVPA *138 creates an action in tort and,
therefore, should be interpreted in light of the well-established common law (and international law) presumption that
organizations are liable in tort for the acts of their agents. See Balt. & Potomac R.R. v. Fifth Baptist Church, 108 U.S. 317,
330 (1883); Br. for Petitioners at 12-17, Mohamad v. Palestinian Authority, No. 11-88 (Sup. Ct. Dec. 14, 2011) (“Mohamad
Br.”). Moreover, the TVPA’s use of the term “individual” comports with this presumption because this term has often been
construed as synonymous with the term “person,” which has a broad legal meaning that includes organizational entities, such
as corporations. See, e.g., Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 428 & n.13 (1998); Mohamad Br. at 19-20 (citing cases
from federals courts of appeals); see also id. at 17-18 (noting that dictionary definitions of the word “individual” often
include non-natural entities).

Furthermore, such a broad interpretation is consistent with the structure of the TVPA, which incorporates agency principles
by imposing liability on individuals who “subject[]” a victim to torture or extrajudicial killing. /d. at 25-26. This construction
also is consistent with the fact that organizational liability exists under other federal statutes that provide civil remedies to
victims of torture and extrajudicial killing. See, e.g., *139 Brentwood Acad. v. Term. Secondary Sch. Athletic Ass’n, 531 U.S.
288 (2001) (permitting a section 1983 suit against an association); Ungar v. Palestine Liberation Org., 402 F.3d 274, 276 (1st
Cir. 2005) (affirming ATA judgment against terrorist organizations); Murphy v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 740 F. Supp. 2d 51,
72 (D.D.C. 2010) (finding terrorist organization liable under 28 U.S.C. § 1605A(c)); see also Mohamad Br. at 30-34. Finally,
the legislative history of the TVPA reveals that Congress’s use of the term “individual” in the TVPA was only to “make
crystal clear that foreign states or their entities cannot be sued ....” S. Rep. No. 102-249, at 6 (1991), and that Congress
repeatedly assumed that organizations would be proper defendants in TVPA lawsuits. Mohamad Br. at 43-49. For these and
other reasons elaborated in the briefs before the Supreme Court in Mohamad, Congress clearly intended the TVPA to provide
a remedy against a broader set of defendants that includes entities other than natural persons.

IV. The District Court Improperly Dismissed the Negligence And Intentional Tort Claims

Plaintiffs pleaded a number of state law tort claims against defendants subject to this appeal, including negligence, negligent
infliction of emotional distress (“NIED”), intentional infliction of emotional distress (“LIED”), assault and battery, trespass,
and recovery under New York’s *140 wrongful death and survival statutes. The district court wrongly dismissed claims
against defendants under each of these theories of tort liability.

A. The District Court Wrongly Dismissed the Negligence Claims

The district court dismissed plaintiffs’ claims for negligence and NIED based on its conclusion that the plaintiffs failed to
“allege or identify a duty owed to Plaintiffs” by the defendants. SPA55 (Terrorist Attacks 1; cf’ SPA232 n.6 (Terrorist
Attacks V); SPA88 (Terrorist Attacks IT). The court was simply wrong about this: plaintiffs expressly alleged a duty owed and
violated by the defendants. See R.3916 (“By virtue of their participation in the conspiracy to commit acts of international
terrorism against the United States, its nationals and allies, including the September 11th Attack, the defendants negligently,
intentionally, recklessly, willfully and wantonly breached duties of care owed to plaintiffs and the employees of plaintiffs’
insureds.””) (emphasis added).

Because the district court overlooked the plain language of the pleadings, it did not conduct an analysis of whether
defendants did, in fact, owe plaintiffs a duty of care. Had it done so, it would have found the duty to be manifest. In New

A. Clockwork.

Q. So we would look at when the Clockwork group
was brought into this and the Epstein case was used
then and then we would look at the payroll records to
see whether Mr. Edwards got a bonus after the
Clockwork group was brought into the Ponzi scheme,
correct?

A. From a timing perspective, yes. But
Mr. Edwards had nothing to do with the Ponzi scheme,
nor was he rewarded even surreptitiously without his
knowledge for he helping me with the Ponzi scheme. If he
was rewarded it was because he deserved, ] felt he
deserved a reward, having 2 nothing to do with the Ponzi
scheme. The bulk of this law firm had nothing to do
‘with the Ponzi scheme,

Q. 1] think you testified already, though, that
money was fundable in the firm, right? ] mean, you
know, illegal money was used for legitimate purposes,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. So, for example, investigations that
were done with the Epstein case, it's very possible
that legitimate Ponzi money was used to finance those
investigations?

A. I'd be guessing. It's certainly possible

Page 114)

because all the money went into a whole series of
pots, and if you look at, most of the pots were trust
accounts. If you look back, you look to see what my
CFO, who was also a co-conspirator was doing, she was
pulling the money from wherever she needed to to fund
whatever she needed to fund.

MR. LAVECCHIO: Off the record a second.

[Discussion off the record.]

BY MR. GOLDBERGER:

Q. Let me circle back to what you needed to
learn about the Epstein cases to help make your pitch
to the investors.

You talked about the manifest already,
correct, the flight manifest?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. What else did you want to learn about
the case or what else did you learn about the case so
that you were conversant when you spoke to the
investors about the Epstein case?

A. |] recall asking someone what the causes of
action were.

Q. Okay. Did you understand what they were?

A. J likely did at the time, ] don't remember
what they were now.

Q. Okay. Do you know which case we are talking

about? By the way, you had a number of Epstein cases
in-house, do you know which case you were talking
about?

A. As] sit here today, no, sir, ] don't
remember.

Q. Was it a state case or a federal case?

A. J don’t remember one way or the other.

Q. All right.

A. Jutilized all those boxes all together. ]
don't remember which one |] sold them.

Q. And the exhibits --

A. It's something completely fictitious that J
made up that ] told them.

Q. The exhibit that you were shown earlier,
Exhibit Number 1, that's the long multi-page federal
lawsuit. Do you know whether that was part of the
information that you reviewed or shown to the
investors when you were pitching to them?

A. J] donot remember one way or the other.

Q. Okay. Now, did you make any effort to learn
from your co-conspirator who the plaintiffs were in
this case, what kind of women they were?

A, Only that they were underage.

Q. Did anyone tell you that these women had --

some of these women n had a history of p a history of prostitution?
Page 116]

A. They may have told me that, 1] wouldn't have
cared one way or the other,

Q. Why would you not have cared about that,
Mr. Rothstein?

A. Ithad nothing to do with the sale of the
Ponzi scheme settlements.

Q. Okay. Were you told by anyone whether any
of the women involved as plaintiffs in the case may
have worked at adult clubs in the past? I mean strip
clubs, let's call it what it is.

A. | may have been told that one way or the
other. But again, it had nothing to do with the Ponzi
scheme sale of fake settlements.

Q. As part of the information that you were
told by you co-conspirator, Russel] Adler, were you
told that some of the plaintiffs that you had in-house
had travelled on Mr. Epstein’s airplane?

A. I believe Russ did tel] me that.

Q. You know, in fact, that that was not true,
correct?

A. Ihave no idea one way or the other, nor did
] care.

Q. But your co-conspirator told you that,
right?

A. Mr. Adler did, in fact, tell me that certain

the girls, as I said around 23, 24 something along those
lines, they were underage; they were under the age of
consent in Florida.

And so each and every one of those events was
a crime being perpetrated -- and let's be clear, not
just being perpetrated by Epstein, but by other people
who were involved there at the mansion.

And so what the Palm Beach Police Department
was putting together was that this mansion in Florida
was the next of sexual abuse of young girls here in
Florida that involved literally, in this period of time,
more than a hundred events that they were able to
document of sexual abuse. When you put that together
with the pattern or practice that was being revealed
there, there were hundreds of acts of sexual abuse going
on in the mansion.

But then what becomes -- and in this is where
I indicated the answer would continue on -- the problem
was that the evidence was starting to show that this was
a much broader series of events. For example, there
were flight logs showing that Mr. Epstein was then
flying with underaged girls and those flight logs, you
know, as the flight logs began to develop, for example,
we have seen -- I know in the last day or two here, one

underage girl was Virginia Roberts who is on the flight,

There was some discussion on the motion and Mr. Koeppel requested it be
amended to include a reconsideration of the fine based on how much progress was
made and how they proceeded in getting it completed. Mr. Ochstein did not
object.

AMENDED MOTION BY MR. OCHSTEIN TO IMPOSE A FINE OF
$250.00 A DAY, COMMENCING ON MARCH 22, 2008 AND
CONTINUING UNTIL COMPLIANCE IS ACHIEVED, SUCH FINE TO
BE RECONSIDERED BASED ON PROGRESS OF COMPLETION
SECONDED BY MS. DUEMLER

MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY

D. Case # 08-2477, 215 Colonial Lane, Susan C. Lee Trust
Violation of Chapter 42, Section 42-87 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of
Ordinances, swimming pools and gates to be kept in a good state of repair, roof
maintained so as not to leak, exterior surfaces to be kept in a good state of repair,
no conditions allowed which provides harborage for vermin and Chapter 18,
Section 18-551, fences and gates for swimming pools to be not less than four (4)
feet in height and gates to be self-closing and self-latching.

Lead Code Enforcement Officer Walton advised he had broken the seven (7)
violations in this case down to two classifications, (A) which was violations 1,2
and

3, which concerned the pool and (B) which were violations 4, 5, 6 and 7. The
violator was out of compliance four (4) days for (A), violations 1, 2 and 3 for
which the Town was requesting a fine of $100.00 a day for each of the four days
out of compliance. The violator had been given until April 14, 2008 to come into
compliance for (B), violations 4, 5, 6 and 7 but these violations were still
outstanding. The Town requests a fine of $250.00 a day commencing on April 15,
2008 and continuing until compliance is achieved.

Amy Fischer was present on behalf of the homeowner, along with Mr. Lawrence,
an architect who she said was assisting them in trying to remedy the problems
which had turned out to be more extensive than they had anticipated. She detailed
the problems with obtaining the proper roofer and the time frame involved. Some
of the issues involved code changes and whether or not the roof could be replaced
with a similar system or whether it had to be upgraded to meet certain hurricane
requirements. Some of the issues had been taken care of immediately but it was
not feasible to remediate some of the problems in the time constraints the Town
had afforded them. Ms. Fischer requested this matter be continued for forty-five
(45) days or they be given a forty-five (45) day window to come into compliance.
She said they had problems with contractors who had not done things in an
expeditious, correct manner.

Mr. Lawrence was sworn in by Recording Secretary Houston and said he had
nothing to add other than that patching was not an option and the roof had to be

replaced. -

While we consider demographics as an important long-term
factor for investing (as discussed in the Third Quarter 2015
issue of Global Foresight: Investing for the Ages), in the short
run, it is eclipsed by economic cycles and political changes. For
instance, Japan’s and Germany’s economies have each been
performing well over the last few years, despite being the
second and third oldest countries in the world with the median
population age of 47 years (Monaco has the world’s oldest
population at 52 years). However, in the longer run, demo-
graphics factor into economic
growth as consumption declines
dramatically in your 50s and 60s
from where it is in your 30s and
40s. Health care burdens also
increase and presumably need to
be funded with higher taxes that
will eventually weigh on the
disposable incomes of younger
workers.

The largest emerging market,

China, has a median age comparable to the U.S. and arguably
has far worse demographics as China faces a big decline in new
workers over the next ten years when the number of retirees
may exceed the number of new entrants into the labor force as
shown in CHART 1.

South Korea is the oldest emerging market with a median age
of 41. East Asian economies, including Japan, have grown over
the years due to migration from villages to urban centers,
resulting in productivity gains that have fueled economic
expansion. Although this migration may continue a while
longer, EM investors should understand the reality that the
economic growth case outside of South Asia and Southeast
Asia is mostly limited to productivity gains. India has the best
demographic profile of any major emerging market as shown

GLOBAL FORESIGHT THIRD QUAPTER 2017

...in the longer run,
demographics factor into
economic growth as consumption
declines dramatically in your 50s
and 60s from where it is in your
30s and 40s.

in CHART 2, with progressively younger population brackets
getting steadily larger, indicating a stable increase in labor force
for long-term economic growth.

Young Ideas

Japan has seen a long, steady economic recovery behind the
market-friendly policies of Prime Minister Abe. The U.S. has
experienced slow but consistent growth, arguably being driv-
en more by its culture of innovation
and leadership in the tech sector that
has led its market’s returns. By com-
parison, Europe has been plagued
by infighting and rotating eco-
nomic and political crises for most
of the last nine years. In addition,
when we consider the challenges to
growth Europe faces longer-term
as a result of its aging populations,
it would seem difficult to make the
case that the bull market centered in the U.S. may see its next
leg driven by its counterparts across the Atlantic. However,
we see the European continent energized by the electoral suc-
cess of 39-year-old Emmanuel Macron, who not only won the
French presidency in May, but also a strong party majority
in its legislative body, the National Assembly. This mandate
should pave the way for economic reforms that we believe in-
vestors will embrace. It is a massive change in sentiment from
six months ago when markets were fearing the “anti-European
Union” rhetoric of since-defeated Marine Le Pen.

Unifying Europe is no easy task, but the best chance appears
to be in the hands of a political outsider with pro-business
and economic policies that manage to be sufficiently main-
stream to keep France from fracturing into far-left and far-

in a DUI case in a suburb of Los Angeles, a popular WeChat channel reported that the
motorist was undocumented and had committed the act to extend his stay in the United
States.*” Zhang noted that another cause of concern was the fact that these WeChat
channels helped foster anxiety among first-generation Chinese. As with other Chinese
immigrants who rely on traditional Chinese-language media for information, the anti-
American hothouse created by WeChat’s “news channels” leads to a type of resentful pro-

Chinese nationalism that is ripe for exploitation by the Chinese government.

WeChat may be no more slanted in its treatment of information than American media
that serve domestic political extremes, but there is no precedent for the situation
WeChat has created: A vast and vital community of Americans gets most of its “news”
from, and does most of its communicating via, a platform known to be censored by a
foreign government that opposes free speech and has been named by the US National

Security Strategy as the greatest long-term security challenge the nation faces.

Western Media

The Chinese Communist Party has always recognized the usefulness of the overseas
media (both in local languages and Chinese) as a means to get its message out. Foreign-
and Chinese-language media have always served the cause of China’s revolution. For
example, in the 1930s, foreign journalist Edgar Snow sang the praises of the Chinese
Communist Party and specifically its chairman, Mao Zedong. The Party conducted a
campaign in the United States in the 1940s to turn the American public against the
regime of Chiang Kai-shek and to soften criticism of China’s Communists. Organizations
such as the Institute of Pacific Relations, which provided Americans with in-depth
coverage of Asia, were staffed by Communist agents and played an important role in
fashioning public opinion on America’s relations with China. To be sure, these techniques
were not unique to the Chinese Communist Party. The government of Chiang Kai-shek
and its “China lobby” also used the overseas press to serve its purposes. In the 1950s,
the KMT government conducted a campaign against pro-Communist newspapers in the
United States, convincing the US government to shutter several pro-PRC outlets and expel

pro-PRC journalists.

The events of 1989 sparked a significant change in China’s foreign propaganda campaign.
Following China’s crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing and other
cities, China’s image sank to a low not seen by Chinese officials in decades.** China
Books and Periodicals, which had been operating in the United States since the 1950s,

closed its offices on Fifth Avenue in New York City. And the Foreign Languages Press

And so I was stymied in trying to get
information from Mr. Epstein at that point. I think
there were two depositions, if I recall correctly off
the top of my head, that I had an opportunity to review
in which he took the 5th when asked questions about
Dershowitz.

So at that point in trying to figure out, you
know, whether Mr. Dershowitz was involved in sexually
abusing not only Virginia Roberts, but in other girls,
then you go down to the next level, next layer of the
criminal conspiracy. Epstein is at the top, so you go
to the next layer. These are, you know, basically the
women who, from what I could gather, were older than the
age that Epstein wanted to sexually abuse. I think
these were 22, 23-year-old girls, so they had, you know,
essentially aged out of being his sexual abuse victims,
but they continued to -- what they would do is collect
girls for him under the age of 18, that I guess was in
his target range.

And so what -- so the next person I wanted to
talk to, you know, and get information from was Sarah
Kellen. Sarah Kellen is on a lot of these flight logs
with, you know, these girls that -- or women and with
Epstein and others, and so I wanted to talk to Sarah

Kellen.

hire him, he devoted more and more time and energy to the law.

In less than two years, Lenny was arrested 15 times. Club owners
were afraid to book him. He couldn’ t get a gig in six months. On a
Christmas day, he was alone in his hotel room, and | brought him a $500
bill. With a large safety pin, he attached it to his denim jacket. When he
finally got a booking in Monterey, he admitted, “I feel like it's taking me
away from my work.”

Lenny lived way up in the hills. His house was protected by barbed
wire and a concrete gate, except that it was always open. He had a wall-to-
wall one-way mirror in his living room, but when the sun was shining you
could see into the room instead of out. He was occasionally hassled by
police on his own property. One evening in October 1963, we were talking
while he was shaving, when four officers suddenly appeared, loud and
obnoxious. He asked them to leave unless they had a search warrant.

One of the cops took out his gun. “Here's my search warrant,” he
said. Then Lenny and the cops had a discussion about the law, such as the
rules of evidence, and after half an hour they left. Lenny tried to take it all
in stride, but the encounter was depressing, and he changed his mind

about going out that night.

“Huge, huge upside that you’re not going to get if you build a strip mall in Topeka,” said
Terri Adler, managing partner of law firm Duval & Stachenfeld LLP, who also spoke at the
event.

Yet the Bronx faces a formidable problem: It’s competing with other zones across the city,
including waterfronts in Brooklyn and Queens with stronger momentum. The tax break
Bronx officials hope will rejuvenate their borough may instead lure more money to what
looks like a safer bet across the river.

In November, Amazon.com Inc. selected Long Island City for its next headquarters.
Portions of that Queens neighborhood, including a former plastics factory the retailer
plans to occupy, are inside opportunity zones, even though they’re among the city’s fastest-
growing areas. In 2017, more apartments were built there than in any other neighborhood
in the city.

Driving Alabama

Alex Flachsbart, 30, has a lot of time to talk when he’s in his SUV crisscrossing Alabama. A
lawyer who specialized in economic development grants and tax breaks, he quit his job last
year to start Opportunity Alabama, aiming to connect capital to worthy projects. For the
past several months, he’s been educating people about opportunity zones, speaking to
local officials, businesses and investors.

“T have done the OZ PowerPoint God knows how many times,” Flachsbart, who grew up in
the Bay Area, said from behind the wheel one day in December.

asked if she wanted to make money. She was told she would
have to provide a massage and should make $200. [Dobbs]
thought about the offer and agreed to meet with Jeffrey.

Molly (Unknown last name) and Tony (Unknown last

house. Upon her arrival to the house she was introduced to
Epstein in the kitchen of the house. She was also intro-
duced to a white female known to her as Sarah. She was led
upstairs to the main bedroom known to her as Jeff Epstein’s
bedroom.

Sarah arranged the massage table and covered the table

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013124.txt,"208 12 The Engineering and Development of Ethics

rise to questions about the ethical value of various practical modalities of AGI development,
for instance:

e Should AGI be developed in a top-secret installation by a select group of individuals selected
for a combination of technical and scientific brilliance and moral uprightness, or other
qualities deemed relevant (a “closed approach)? Or should it be developed out in the
open, in the manner of open-source software projects like Linux? (an open approach).
The open approach allows the collective intelligence of the world to more fully participate
— but also potentially allows the more unsavory elements of the human race to take some
of the publicly-developed AGI concepts and tools private, and develop them into AGIs
with selfish or evil purposes in mind. Is there some meaningful intermediary between these
extremes?

e Should governments regulate AGI, with Friendliness in mind (as advocated carefully by e.g
Bill Hibbard [Hib02])? Or will this just cause AGI development to move to the handful of
countries with more liberal policies? ... or cause it to move underground, where nobody can
see the dangers developing? As a rough analogue, it’s worth noting that the US government’s
imposition of restrictions on stem cell research, under President George W. Bush, appears
to have directly stimulated the provision of additional funding for stem cell research in other
nations like Korea, Singapore and China.

The former issue is, obviously, highly relevant to CogPrime (which is currently being devel-
oped via the open source CogPrime project); and so the various dimensions of this issues are
worth briefly sketching here.

We have a strong skepticism of selfappointed elite groups that claim (even if they genuinely
believe) that they know what’s best for everyone, and a healthy respect for the power of collective
intelligence and the Global Brain, which the open approach is ideal for tapping. On the other
hand, we also understand the risk of terrorist groups or other malevolent agents forking an open
source AGI project and creating something terribly dangerous and destructive. Balancing these
factors against each other rigorously, seems beyond the scope of current human science.

Nobody really understands the social dynamics by which open technological knowledge plays
out in our current world, let alone hypothetical future scenarios. Right now there exists open
knowledge about many very dangerous technologies, and there exist many terrorist groups, yet
these groups fortunately make scant use of these technologies. The reasons why appear to be
essentially sociological — the people involved in these terrorist groups tend not to be the ones
who have mastered the skills of turning public knowledge on cutting-edge technologies into real
engineered systems. But while it’s easy to observe this sociological phenomenon, we certainly
have no way to estimate its quantitative extent from first principles. We don’t really have a
strong understanding of how safe we are right now, given the technology knowledge available
right now via the Internet, textbooks, and so forth. Even relatively straightforward issues such
as nuclear proliferation remain confusing, even to the experts.

It’s also quite clear that keeping powerful AGI locked up by an elite group doesn’t really
provide reliable protection against malevolent human agents. History is rife with such situations
going awry, e.g. by the leadership of the group being subverted, or via brute force inflicted by
some outside party, or via a member of the elite group defecting to some outside group in the
interest of personal power or reward or due to group-internal disagreements, etc. There are
many things that can go wrong in such situations, and the confidence of any particular group
that they are immune to such issues, cannot be taken very seriously. Clearly, neither the open
nor closed approach qualifies as a panacea.

Here's my wrap-up: sympathy is good. Trying to build a better relationship is good. And
I understand that some people may have serious, important reasons that they can't or don't
want to walk away from their romantic partner. (That's one of the things feminism has
always worked towards: giving people many sources of support and safety nets, so people
can leave abusive partners if necessary.) But. Seriously, if your partner sucks? Walking
away is an option -- it's even an option, sometimes, when you think it's not an option. Just
remember that.

[storytime] I'm Not Your Sex-Crazy Nympho Dreamgirl

This was originally published in 2011 on GoodMenProject.com, and it got a lot of
attention. I think the feelings I outline in this piece are shared by a lot of people, and that
they're one of the reasons people often get angry about porn. But as I said in BDSM
Can Be 'Love Sex' Too, I don't think restricting porn is the answer to these feelings. I
think the answer is encouraging people to be honest, yet respectful and flexible about
their desires. For many people, mainstream porn seems to function as sex education --
and that can be a real problem, because mainstream porn shows a very specific
stereotype of sexuality. But if more people had better and more complete sex education,
then more people would recognize that mainstream porn is a very limited and particular
product, and they'd also recognize that most people aren't interested in actually enacting
that style of sexuality. I also think porn probably receives an unfair portion of the blame
in these debates. It's possible that the current ubiquity of porn is partly to blame for sex-
crazy nympho dreamgirl anxieties, but there are plenty of other stereotype sources in
our culture -- I wish that all the people who talk about banning porn would also talk
about banning romantic comedies!

te Kk ok

I'm Not Your Sex-Crazy Nympho Dreamgirl

There's this cultural image of what it means to be female, and good in bed. The image
includes being young and thin and cisgendered of course, and that can be problematic.
But it also includes a lot of behavioral stuff: the way you squirm, the way you moan,
being Super Excited about everything the guy wants to do, and Always Being Up for It --
whatever It is. When people think about good in bed, for a woman, that's often what
they think.

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018511
"
IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016373.txt,"and J. S. Mill and later by behavioral psychologists, like Pavlov and B. F. Skinner. On
this view, the abstractness and hierarchical structure of representations is something of an
illusion, or at least an epiphenomenon. All the work can be done by association and
pattern detection—especially if there are enough data.

Over time, there has been a seesaw between this bottom-up approach to the
mystery of learning and Plato’s alternative, top-down one. Maybe we get abstract
knowledge from concrete data because we already know a lot, and especially because we
already have an array of basic abstract concepts, thanks to evolution. Like scientists, we
can use those concepts to formulate hypotheses about the world. Then, instead of trying
to extract patterns from the raw data, we can make predictions about what the data should
look like if those hypotheses are right. Along with Plato, such “rationalist” philosophers
and psychologists as Descartes and Noam Chomsky took this approach.

Here’s an everyday example that illustrates the difference between the two
methods: solving the spam plague. The data consist of a long unsorted list of messages in
your in-box. The reality is that some of these messages are genuine and some are spam.
How can you use the data to discriminate between them?

Consider the bottom-up technique first. You notice that the spam messages tend
to have particular features: a long list of addressees, origins in Nigeria, references to
million-dollar prizes or Viagra. The trouble is that perfectly useful messages might have
these features, too. If you looked at enough examples of spam and non-spam emails, you
might see not only that spam emails tend to have those features but that the features tend
to go together in particular ways (Nigeria plus a million dollars spells trouble). In fact,
there might be some subtle higher-level correlations that discriminate the spam messages
from the useful ones—a particular pattern of misspellings and IP addresses, say. If you
detect those patterns, you can filter out the spam.

The bottom-up machine-learning techniques do just this. The learner gets
millions of examples, each with some set of features and each labeled as spam (or some
other category) or not. The computer can extract the pattern of features that distinguishes
the two, even if it’s quite subtle.

How about the top-down approach? I get an email from the editor of the Journal
of Clinical Biology. It refers to one of my papers and says that they would like to publish
an article by me. No Nigeria, no Viagra, no million dollars; the email doesn’t have any
of the features of spam. But by using what I already know, and thinking in an abstract
way about the process that produces spam, I can figure out that this email is suspicious.

(1) I know that spammers try to extract money from people by appealing to
human greed.

(2) I also know that legitimate “open access” journals have started covering their
costs by charging authors instead of subscribers, and that I don’t practice anything like
clinical biology.

Put all that together and I can produce a good new hypothesis about where that
email came from. It’s designed to sucker academics into paying to “publish” an article in
a fake journal. The email was a result of the same dubious process as the other spam
emails, even though it looked nothing like them. I can draw this conclusion from just one
example, and I can go on to test my hypothesis further, beyond anything in the email
itself, by googling the “editor.”

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023376.txt,"In re: TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001., 2012 WL 257568 (2012)

the recipients of their support advanced al-Qaeda’s activities -- despite plaintiffs’ detailed pleading of defendants’ extensive
dealings with al-Qaeda and its network of supporting entities. The Court also granted particular defendants’ motions *21 to
dismiss claims predicated on the Torture Victims’ Protection Act, the Alien Tort Statute, RICO, and common law causes of
action.

On October 7, 2010, the parties jointly requested that the district court enter Rule 54(b) final judgments in favor of all
defendants dismissed through Terrorist Attacks IV and Terrorist Attacks V, as well as with respect to dismissals effectuated
through the Terrorist Attacks I and Terrorist Attacks IT decisions, to the extent not within the scope of the January 10, 2006
Rule 54(b) judgment. Seventy-five defendants fell within the scope of that joint request.

The district court granted the parties’ joint request for entry of Rule 54(b) judgments on July 13, 2011, and the clerk of court
entered final judgment in favor of the seventy-five defendants pursuant to Rule 54(b) on July 14, 2011. Plaintiffs in all
actions filed timely Notices of Appeal as to all Rule 54(b) defendants within the scope of their respective actions.

Following the filing of plaintiffs’ Notices of Appeal, this Court issued its decision in Doe v. Bin Laden, 663 F.3d 64, 2011
U.S. App. Lexis 22516 (2d Cir. 2011) (per curiam), another of the cases comprising the September 11th MDL. In Doe, the
Court held that the FSIA’s “terrorism exception, rather than limiting the jurisdiction conferred by the noncommercial tort *22
exception, provides an additional basis for jurisdiction.” Jd. at *19 (emphasis added). Therefore, the Court concluded, “the
noncommercial tort exception [§ 1605(a)(5)] can be a basis for a suit arising from the terrorist acts of September 11, 2001.”
Id. The Court remanded the case against Afghanistan for jurisdictional discovery. Jd. at *20-21.

The Court recognized that its holding conflicted with and abrogated the prior panel’s decision in Terrorist Attacks HT, and
noted that the Circuit had employed its mini-en banc procedure, whereby the new decision had been circulated to all active
judges and had received no objections, including from members of the panel that decided Terrorist Attacks III. Id. at *19-20
n.10. Doe, therefore, is now the law of this Circuit, and Terrorist Attacks Iil’s holding regarding § 1605(a)(5) has been
overruled. See Frontera, 582 F.3d at 400 (applying the mini-en banc process and holding that “to the extent that” an earlier
opinion “conflicts with our holding today ... it is overruled’).

In light of Doe, plaintiffs moved this Court to summarily vacate the dismissals in favor of defendants’ SRC, SJRC and NCB,
and remand those claims for discovery, on the grounds that Doe abrogates and overrules the legal basis for those dismissals.
Appellants’ Motion to Summarily Vacate *23 and Remand, Case No. 11-3294, Docket # 243, at p. 7. Those defendants
sought and received an extension of time until January 23, 2012 to respond to that Motion, which remains pending as of the
date of the filing of this brief.

In an effort to narrow the scope of these appeals, plaintiffs in all cases agreed voluntarily to withdrew the appeals as to
twenty-two defendants.° Several additional non-dispositive stipulations of dismissal were filed in individual cases as to other
Appellees. As a result, these appeals now focus on the dismissals for failure to state a claim of defendants Al Rajhi Bank,
Saudi American Bank (SAMBA), DMI Trust, Kamel, and Dallah al Baraka, and the dismissals for lack of personal
jurisdiction of defendants Abdullah bin Laden, Bakr bin Laden, Omar bin Laden, Tariq bin Laden, Yeslam bin Laden, Dallah
Avco, DMI Administrative Services, Faisal Islamic Bank, Saleh al Hussayen, Yousef Jameel, Abdulrahman bin Mahfouz,
Khaled bin Mahfouz, NCB, Obeid, Abdullah al Rajhi, Saleh al Rajhi, Suleiman al Rajhi, Schreiber & Zindel Treuhand

Disposition Below

As noted above, in Jerrorist Attacks I, Terrorist Attacks Il, SAMBA I, DMI-Kamel, Terrorist Attacks IV, and Terrorist
Attacks V, the district court dismissed all claims against the defendant-appellees. Thereafter, the court entered partial final
judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b). This brief addresses the district court’s dismissals of plaintiffs’ ATA, ATS, TVPA, and
torts claims against Al Rajhi Bank, Saudi American Bank, DMI Trust, Saleh Abdullah Kamel, and Dallah al Baraka for
failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), and dismissals of the Saudi Joint Relief Committee, Saudi Red Crescent Society,
and National Commercial Bank for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the FSIA.

magazine’s scope was strictly cultural, the answer eight years ago, on
the heels of the Iraq invasion, usually came down to some
combination of the words “America,” “Bush,” and local expletives.
Curious about whether that had changed, I repeated that itinerary this
summer, conducting a dozen panels in those same four countries,
with subjects representing the diversity of the Arab World, from fully
covered Persian Gulf oil heiresses to skirt-donning Beirut Christians
to democracy-minded Tahrir Square veterans to Casablanca slum kids
fending off suicide-bomber entreaties. Their viewpoint again proved
surprisingly consistent—and had shifted dramatically from my last go-
round.

That background narrative, it turns out, drives everything. It’s hard to
overstate the Iraq War’s effect on brand America: it fed into Arab
insecurities, exploited in turn by regional demagogues, that outsiders
are at fault for whatever ails them. At one raucous meeting at a
university in Casablanca, which we later dubbed “The Pinata
Session,” 120 students eager to tee off on an American, any
American, swarmed what was supposed to be a meet-and-greet with
two dozen journalism majors, showering us with two hours of
prewritten diatribes.

Contrast that with my recent visit to Casablanca, where I happened
upon a parade of 20,000 protesters, stretched across a half mile,
calling for democratic reforms from the autocratic King Mohammed
VI. For two hours, the placard-raising marchers chanted in unison—
The people of Libya and Syria keep getting killed—they’re not
afraid!.... Shakira got a million! (a reference to the singer’s fee at a
royal event)...Look, see, the people are scary!—and precisely zero
had anything to do with America (or Israel, for that matter). “The
consensus 1s this: it’s a Moroccan problem,” Reda Oulamine, a top
opposition leader, told me during the march, “and it’s being decided
by the Moroccan street.”

The risks of cyberattacks continue to increase.

To date, the attacks have had limited detrimental
impact on the broad US economy, but the impact
could be far-reaching if foreign governments such
as Russia or China, criminal entities, or lone actors
attack critical infrastructure in the US or any other
major country.

China Submerges Under Its Debt Burden and
Capital Outflows
At $11.4 trillion, China is the second-largest
economy in the world, with a 13.8% share of
global exports and a 9.7% share of global imports.
It accounts for nearly half of global
demand for zinc, tin, steel, copper and
nickel, and more than half for thermal
coal, aluminum and iron ore. Any major
slowdown or volatility across bond,
currency and equity markets in China,
including Hong Kong, would have major
ramifications for the rest of the world.
While the US has limited direct
economic exposure to China—only 0.6%
of exports as a share of GDP, 0.6%
of bank assets and 0.7% of corporate
profits—any shocks in China will
reverberate through US financial markets.

By November, even his Foreign Minister, David Levy, was making noises
about quitting. He said it would be a waste of time to stay in the cabinet if it was
going to bring the peace process to a halt. I warned Bibi, both in the Knesset and in
a series of speeches, about the alternative on the Palestinian side if those who
wanted a negotiated peace had nothing but stalemate to show for it. And lives, I
insisted, were at stake. Both through closed-door sessions of the Knesset’s security
and foreign affairs committee, and my own contacts in military intelligence, I was
convinced that the result would be a second, much more deadly, intifada. Not with
Molotov cocktails, but guns, and suicide bombs.

I was not out to score political points in keeping the pressure on Bibi to move
forward. In fact, I announced that if Bibi did go ahead and finalize the terms for
our Oslo redeployment, Labor would once again provide the extra Knesset votes
needed for him to get it approved.

Early in 1998, he sent word that he wanted to talk. The message came through
Yaakov Ne’eman, his Finance Minister and a prominent lawyer whom I knew and
liked. He and I held an exploratory meeting at which he proposed talks with Bibi
on the prospect of a unity government that would help move the peace process
forward. I said I’d talk, with one proviso: the discussions would be genuinely
secret, with no leaks. I was not prepared to engage in political gamesmanship. In
May, Bibi sent an assurance of confidentiality through Ne’eman. The first of about
a half-dozen meetings came a few days later at the Prime Minister’s residence in
Jerusalem. Then, we shifted venue, meeting at a Mossad-owned villa north of Tel
Aviv. I brought along Bougie Herzog, a bright young lawyer, and Labor Party
member, who was working in the same law firm and Ne’eman. It was by no means
clear we’d agree on a unity government. To my amusement, if not altogether to my
surprise, I got word that Bibi was putting out separate political feelers to Shimon
Peres. But before long, it became clear there was a specific political motivation
behind his approaching me. It was indeed the peace process. But it wasn’t the
Palestinian peace process, something Bibi still clearly wanted to avoid as much as
humanly possible. It was an attempt to engage with Syria.

He asked me about the talks under Rabin and Peres, and my views on the
possibility of a deal with President Assad. He also wanted my assessment about
whether the army could work out arrangements to safeguard the country’s security
if we handed back most, if not all, of the Golan Heights. If so, what kind of
security arrangements, with what timeline? We met through the summer, as the

Porter had, before the age of forty, two bitter ex-wives, at least one
of whom he had beaten, and both of whom he had cheated on at talk-
of-the-town levels. During a stint as a Senate staffer, the married Porter
had an affair with an intern, costing him his job. His girlfriend Samantha
Dravis had moved in with Porter in the summer of 2017, while, quite
unbeknownst to her, he was seeing Hicks. “I cheated on you because you're
not attractive enough,” he later told Dravis.

In a potentially criminal break of protocol, Porter had gained access
to his raw FBI clearance reports and seen the statements of his ex-wives.
His most recent ex-wife had also written a blog about his alleged abuse,
which, while it did not name him, clearly fingered him. Concerned about
the damaging impact his former wives could have on his security review,
he recruited Dravis to help him smooth his relationship with both women.

Lewandowski, Hicks’s former boyfriend, caught wind of the Hicks-
Porter relationship and began working to expose it; by some reports,
he got paparazzi to follow Hicks. Though Porter’s history of abuse was
slowly making its way to the surface as a result of the FBI investigation,
the Lewandowski campaign against Hicks cut through many other efforts
to cover up Porter’s transgressions.

Dravis, in the autumn of 2017, heard the Lewandowski-pushed
rumors of the Hicks-Porter relationship. After finding Hicks’s number
listed under a man’s name in Porter's contacts, Dravis confronted Porter,
who promptly threw her out. Moving back in with her parents, she began
her own revenge campaign, openly talking about Porter's security clear-
ance issues, including to people inside the White House counsel's office,
saying he had protection at the highest levels in the White House. Then,
along with Lewandowski, Dravis helped leak the details of the Hicks-
Porter romance to the Daily Mail, which published a story about it on
February 1.

But Dravis, joined by Porter's former wives, decided that, outra-
geously, he had come out looking good in the Daily Mail account—he
was part of a glam power couple! Porter called Dravis to taunt her: “You
thought you could get me!” Dravis and his former wives all then publicly
revealed their abuse at his hand. His first wife said he kicked and punched
her; she even produced a photograph of her black eye. His second wife

informed the media that she had filed an emergency protective orc
against him.

The White House, or at least Kelly—and likely Hicks—had been aw:
of many of these claims and, effectively, covered them up. (“You usua
have enough competent people for White House positions to weed out t
wife beaters, but you couldn't be so choosy in the Trump White House,’ sz
one Republican acquaintance of Porter's.) The furor that erupted arou
Porter and his troubling gross-guy history not only annoyed Trump
“He stinks of bad press”—it further weakened Kelly. On February 7, af
both of his former wives gave interviews to CNN, Porter resigned.

A publicity-shy Hicks—Donald Trump put a high value on associa’
who did not steal his press opportunities—suddenly found her love |
in the glare of intense international press scrutiny. Her affair with the d
credited Porter highlighted her own odd relationship with the preside
and his family, as well as the haphazard management, interpersonal d:
functions, and general lack of political savvy in the Trump court.

The affair was, curiously, among the least of Hicks’s problems. Indeed, 1
Hicks the Porter scandal became perhaps a better cloud under which
leave the administration than what almost everybody in the West Wi
assumed was the real cloud.

On February 27, a reporter at the Washington insider newsletter Axi
Jonathan Swan, a favorite conduit for White House leaks, reported tl
Josh Raffel was leaving the White House. In a novel arrangement, Rai

Knowledge-Based Education vs.
Process-Based Education

Diagnosis is not the end, but the beginning of practice.
—Martin H. Fischer

In our society we have set up schools to teach knowledge. We concern
ourselves with what facts children know, we test to make sure they
know them, and then we complain that the schools are failing when
they don’t. This idea is so ingrained in our way of looking at school-
ing that when people like me complain about it, we are seen as people
who are rambling around muttering to ourselves.

There are so many people having anxiety attacks about what kids
know, it seems one can find an article about it in every news segment
on education.

I happened on an article in Huffington Post written by someone
named Schweitzer who is listed as “having served at the White
House during the Clinton Administration as Assistant Director for
International Affairs in the Office of Science and Technology Policy.”
Here is a piece of what he said:

The health care debate cannot be understood in historic context
because many Americans have never heard of Thomas Jefferson.
Extrapolating from state surveys, only 14% of American high
school students can name who wrote the Declaration of
Independence. Nearly 75% do not know that George Washington
was our first president. ... We can say that our educational
system has failed when the vast majority of American students
do not know enough to pass an exam to qualify as American
citizens.

This is an astonishing statement.

The most important energy developments of 2012: how countries are planning for Independence Day

Some detail on the components of increased US energy independence:

Net increase in domestic production: we have modeled an increase of 1.8 mm bpd. For context, the 2012 Energy Information
Administration (EIA) outlook has a variety of crude oil production scenarios for 2025 ranging from no increase to an increase
of 2.8 mm bpd (the “technically recoverable resource” case). Any production increase from current levels is expected to come
from “tight oil”, extracted from formations such as Bakken and Eagle Ford, and the Permian Basin. While conventional crude
production volumes in the Gulf may rise, these are expected by the EJA to offset declines elsewhere (Alaska). The EIA’s
optimism is matched by a June 2012 paper from Leonardo Maugeri at Harvard’s Kennedy School, which projects a US crude
oil increase of 2.6 mm bpd by 2020. An illustrative quote’:

“The shale/tight oil boom in the United States is not a temporary bubble, but the most important revolution in the
oil sector in decades. It will probably trigger worldwide emulation over the next decades that might bear surprising results
- given the fact that most shale/tight oil resources in the world are still unknown and untapped.... Thanks to the
technological revolution brought about by the combined use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, the US is now
exploiting its huge and virtually untouched shale and tight oil fields, whose production — although still in its infancy — is
already skyrocketing in North Dakota and Texas.”

Regarding the Bakken shale, Maugeri’s estimate of 300 billion barrels of oil in place are exceeded by larger mean estimates

Reduced consumption due to higher CAFE standards and Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards
the automobile replacement cycle: this is a topic that Miles per gallon, passenger cars

generates a lot of debate and technical discussion about
driving patterns, but this much is clear: CAFE standards

and the ongoing replacement of older cars will improve the
fuel efficiency of the future fleet. The Union for Concerned
Scientists has estimated the benefit of CAFE at 3 million
barrels of oil per day by 2030, while the Administration’s
estimate is 2.2 million by 2025. The average 11-year age of
US cars is at the highest level on record, up from 8.5 years
in 1995. While some of this increase reflects cars with
improved lifespans, it also reflects the impact of the
recession and pent-up demand to replace older cars. Asa ” ove 4983 1988 1993 1998 2003 2008 2013 2018 2023
result, our estimate of 1.5 mm bpd in oil consumption
savings seems reasonable in context.

Impact of rising penetration of natural gas vehicles: The rationale for natural gas vehicles (NGV) stems from a price per
million BTUs for oil that’s 5x higher than natural gas. The US NGV penetration rate is low, in part due to the chicken/egg
problem of the lack of natural gas refueling stations, and a more limited driving range (natural gas tanks generally hold less
energy than diesel tanks). But the economics of NGVs are becoming more compelling for taxis, vans and buses that are
centrally fueled with limited ranges, and for trucks with established routes where refueling stations can be built every 300-400
miles. Such heavy-duty vehicles account for 17% of all petroleum usage in the US. An example: a heavy duty 18-wheeler
might travel 60,000 miles per year and get 5 mpg (using 12,000 gallons of diesel fuel). Assuming a $1.5 difference between
diesel and liquid natural gas prices, a trucking company could save ~ $18,000 in annual fuel costs. The conversion cost to
LNG (liquid natural gas) of $70,000 would imply a 4-year payback period, which is short in the scheme of energy trade-offs.
We assume a very modest NGV penetration rate of 3%, which translates into reduced oil consumption of 0.3 mm bpd.

Oil imported for export purposes: in 2011, the US exported 0.5 mm bpd in refined petroleum products. As a result, part of the
current crude oil import tab is simply for re-export, and is not part of the country’s domestic consumption requirement.

attempt to help put us on the political offensive, after I was asked to record on of
Labor’s TV campaign messages. I knew what I wanted to say. I’d talked it over
with the small group of campaign experts Peres had asked me to assemble
alongside Ramon’s main team. Rather than ignore Bibi, I was going to use my
position as his former commander in Sayeret Matkal, someone who knew him
well, to explain why Peres should lead Israel.

“How many of us can really understand what it means to be a Prime Minister?”
I began. “As head of intelligence, and chief of staff, I have seen, close-up, what it
takes to be a Prime Minister. It is not a game. We’ve had good Prime Ministers:
Ben-Gurion, Peres, Rabin, Begin... Bibi, we know each other well, from the days
when you were an officer under my command. A young officer, and a good one.
Prime Minister is the most important and serious role in this country. Bibi, it’s not
yet you. We need an experienced leader, who will know how to guide us with
wisdom, strength and sensitivity. Shimon Peres is that man.”

Yet we were never going to be able to avoid engaging with Bibi altogether. The
face-to-face television debate between the two candidates was set for May 27, two
days before the election. By American standards, the format was fairly tame. No
direct exchanges were permitted, only a series of questions directed at each
candidate by a leading political journalist, Dan Margalit. Still, it would place
Shimon and Bibi side by side. We spent two days prepping Peres, with Avraham
Burg — an early Peace Now supporter, former Peres aide and Knesset member —
standing in for Bibi. Avraham played the role well, anticipating the lines of attack
Shimon would face. But as I watched, I worried that even he couldn’t replicate one
of Bibi’s key advantages. During his time at the embassy in Washington, and
especially as UN ambassador, Bibi had become a frequent presence on American
television interview shows. Always articulate, he was now also an experienced,
and completely comfortable, television performer. In our debate rehearsals, Peres
sounded well versed on all the issues. Yet I sensed his problem wasn’t going to be
the message, but the medium. He sounded a bit distant, unengaged, almost as if the
TV debate was something he knew he had to go through, but which he thought
slightly sullied the proper purpose of politics.

In the real debate, Shimon seemed to convey the sense that merely being in the
same studio with a pretender as raw and untested as Bibi was offensive. When each
of the candidates was given the opportunity at the end to ask a single question of
the other, Peres didn’t even bother. He did come over as the man with much more

prosecutors skeptical. Not only did
, some of the girls have issues with
drugs or alcohol but also some had
criminal records and other troubies,
Epstein’s legal team claimed. And at
least one of them, they said, fied
when she told police she was
younger than 18 when she started
performing massages for Epstein.

After the meeting, prosecutors
postponed their decision to take the
case to a grand jury.

In the following weeks, police
received complaints that two of the
victims or their families had been
harassed or threatened. Epstein’s
legal team maintains that its private
investigators did nothing illegal or
unethical during their research.

By then, relations’ between
police and prosecutors were fraying.
At a key meeting with prosecutors
and the defense, Detective Joseph
Recarey, the lead investigator, was a
no-show, according to Epstein’s
attorney.

“The embarrassment .on the
prosecutor's face was evident when,
the police officer never showed up
_for the meeting,” attorney Jack
Goldberger said.

Later in April, Recarey walked
into a prosecutor's office at the state
attorney's office and learned the
case was taking an unexpected fim.
The prosecutor, Lanna
' Belohlavek, told Recarey the state
attorney’s office had offered Epstein
a plea deal that would not require
him to serve jail time or receive a
felony conviction.

Recarey told her he disapproved
of the plea offer.

The deal never came to pass,
however.

Future unclear after charge

On May 1, the department asked
prosecutors to approve warrants to
arrest Epstein on four counts of

unlawful sexual activity with aminor -

and to charge his personal assistant,
Sarah Kellen, now 27, for her alleged
role in arranging the visits. Police
officials also wanted to: charge Rob-
son, the selfdescribed H.idi Fleiss,
with lewd and lascivious acts.

By then, the department was
frustrated with the way the state
attorney's office had handled the
case. On the same day the warrants
were requested, Palm Beach Police
. Chief Michael Reiter wrote a letter
to State Attorney Barry Krischer
suggesting he disqualify himself
from the case ifhe would not act. |

Two weeks later, Recarey was
told that prosecutors had decided |
once again to take the case to the
grand jury.

Itis not known how many of the
girls testified before the grand jury.
But Epstein’s defense team said one
girl who was subpoenaed — the one
who said she had sexual intercourse
with Epstein — never showed up.

The grand jury’s indictment was
handed down in July. It was not the

one the police department had .

wanted

charge of unlawful sexual activity
with a minor, Epstein was charged

with one count of felony solicitation -

of prostitution, which carries a
maximum penalty of five years in
prison. He was booked into the Palm ,
Beach County Jail early July 23 and |
released hours later.

Epstein’s legal team “doesn’t
dispute that he had girls over for

assages,” Goldberger said. But he
said their claims that they had sex-
ual encounters with him lack credi- |
bility.

“They are. incapable of being
believed,” he said. “They had crimi-
nal records. They had accusations of
theft made against them by their |
employers. There was evidence of |
drug use by some-ofthem.” ~

What remains for Epstein is yet
to be seen.

The Palm Beach Police Depart-
ment has asked the FBI to investi-
gate the case. It also has returned ©
the $90,000 Epstein donated in 2004.

In New York, candidates for
governor and state attorney gene:
have vowed to return a total of at
least $60,000 in campaign contribu-
tions from Epstein. Meanwhile,
Epstein’s powerful friends have.
remained silent as tabloids and
Internet blogs feast on the public
details of the police investigation. |

Goldberger maintains Epstein’s
innocence but says the legal team
has not ruled out a future plea deal.

He insists Epstein will emerge in the

end with his reputation untarnished.

“He will recover from this,” he
said. ‘

Palm Beach billionaire Jeffrey Epstein,
sexually charged massages, according to
police reports.

The reports also state that another
Epstein attorney agreed to a plea bargain
that would have allowed Epstein to have no |
criminal record. His current attorney de-
nies this happened.

And the documents also reveal that the
father of at least one girl complained that
private investigators aggressively fol-
jowed his car, photographed his home and
chased off visitors.

“Scenarios deal with two worlds: the world of facts and the world of perceptions. They explore for facts but they

Notice that we must change the sign before “consumption rate” to find thrift. Change

downward in consumption rate is change upward in thrift rate, and conversely.
Further

change in growth rate = change in capital productivity
— change in consumption rate, (4.5)

by the same logic as with (4.3). Save space again by reexpressing (4.5) as
acceleration = productivity gain + thrift gain. (4.5a)
Finally divide by acceleration to reach

1= productivity gain + thrift gain

; — (4.6)

if acceleration is nonzero. Reexpress as
1 = free growth index + thrift index, (4.6a)

where indexes are undefined if acceleration is zero.

I think this gets at what Mill meant, and anyhow what I mean. We both describe
acceleration as well as growth. One night think that his “whatever increases the
productive power of labor” is the opposite from my “change in capital productivity.”
But they are about the same. Better machines make their operators more productive

As a solo artist and member of folk-rock duo Pomplamoose, Jack Conte garnered millions of views for his offbeat “video songs,” including
his breakout hit “Yeah Yeah Yeah” and “Pedals,” a robotic tour-de-force with a set that duplicates the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon.

Despite his success, Conte noted the disconnect between page views and revenue, and realized that if you’re a widely viewed artist and you

Will natural gas be a bridge for Primus to green
fuel, or will it be too cheap and attractive to resist as
a permanent substitute for biomass? For the moment,
the company seems keen to squeeze what it can out of
the shale gale. With the help of more than $50 million
in Israeli money, Primus is building a demonstration
plant the size of a house near its headquarters in New
Jersey, due to open this year. The location is off the
map—even Google won’t guide you there, as if it were
some secretive skunk works facility, which is how the
company likes to think of rt. The plant will take natural
gas from the local utility, run it through its proprietary
set of chemical reactions and, on the far end, out of a
spigot, will come gasoline—12.7 gallons per hour at full
capacity. The company’s first commercial plant, due to
start construction next year, will likely be located near
a source of natural gas.

Scaling up the technology this way will reduce the
overhead costs per unit of gasoline—that is, the cost
of fabricating the reactors and buying the zeolites and
feedstocks. Plus, Primus’ technology may prove eco-
nomical enough at a scale small to allow its plants to
be distributed close to remote natural gas wells or even
sources of biomass. It is no coincidence that the com-
pany based itself in verdant New Jersey, “the Garden
State”; proximity to biomass is crucial for producers,
because transporting heavy and unwieldy wood or
corn stalks across large distances tends makes the end
product too costly and undercuts the greenhouse-gas
savings that are a large part of its appeal.

As I prepare to drive off, Fang carts out one of his
collection of red plastic gas cans and dumps a liter or
so of Primus-made, natural gas-to-gasoline fuel into
my tank. A test car tooled around on it last summer,
with no problems. The hope is to be able to charge
a premium for the higher-octane premium product.
“People pay twice as much for organic food,” Boyayian
says. “So why not pay more for green gasoline?” My
fuel sensor can tell the difference: it registers an anom-
alously high miles-per-gallon number.

Fang gives me two thumbs up as I pull away, watch-
ing me drive off on his preferred solution to the ener-
gy crisis. It’s unclear whether Primus will ever find
the occasion to turn back towards biogasoline—and
whether that’s a long-term fix for the world’s ener-
gy and environmental conundrum. Striving to make

27

cleaner fuel for standard, dirty combustion engines
may reinforce drivers’ loyalty to today’s technology.
Such lock-in makes a true revolution difficult until
some alternative energy source—whether battery-
driven electric cars or engines modified to burn car-
bon-neutral, as-yet-unmade biofuels—offers the kind
of convenience and low cost that justifies replacement.
At present, Primus appears set to become part of a
sprawling infrastructure that reinforces the incentives
to use greenhouse gas-producing, gasoline-like fuels.
And for all those concentrated octanes in my tank, I
still have to pull into a Shell station to fill up on con-
ventional gasoline, blended with corm ethanol, in order
to drivehome. ©

galleries. Their exposure to culture was limited to things Jewish—cantorial recitations, Yiddish
theater, lectures by Orthodox rabbis, Jewish museums, Catskill Mountain and Miami Beach
entertainment.

My adult life has been dramatically different. I travel the globe, meet with world leaders, own a
nice art collection, am deeply involved in the world of music, theater and other forms of culture,
and lead a largely secular life (though I too enjoy cantorial music “borsht belt” humor, and a good
pastrami sandwich).

Yet I am their son and grandson. Although my life has taken a very different course—both
personally and professionally—I could not begin to explain who I am, how I got to be who I am,
and where I am heading, without exploring my family background and heritage. It is this history
that helped to form me, that caused me to react against parts of it, and—most important—that
gave me the tools necessary to choose which aspects of my traditions to accept and which to
reject.”

I had a very powerful upbringing, having been born to a family with strong views on religion,
morality, politics and community service. My neighborhood was tight knit. Everyone had a place
and knew their place. Status was important, especially for our parents and grandparents, as was
“yichus” (the Yiddish term for ancestry). But I grew up at a time of change, growth, excitement
and opportunity.

Despite the reality of pervasive anti-Jewish discrimination—in college admission, employment,
residency and social clubs—my generation believed there were no limits to what we could
accomplish. If Jackie Robinson could play second base for the Brooklyn Dodgers, we could do
anything. Maybe that was the reason so many successful people grew up in Brooklyn in the
immediate post-war period. (In 1971, I was selected among 40 young scholars from around the
country for a distinguished fellowship. When we met in Palo Alto, California, we discovered
close to half the group had Brooklyn roots!) We were the breakout generation, standing on the
broad shoulders and backbreaking work of our immigrant grandparents and our working class
parents.

I cannot explain, indeed understand, my own world views, without describing those on whose
shoulders I stand, that from which I have broken out, and the experiences that have shaped my
life. So I will begin at the beginning, with my earliest memories and the stories I have been told
about my upbringing.

But formative experiences do not end at childhood or adolescence. They continue throughout a
lifetime. Learning never ends, at least for those with open minds and hearts, and, though
ideologies may remain relatively fixed over time, they adapt to changing realities and perceptions.
Winston Churchill famously quipped, “Show me a young conservative and I’ll show you someone
with no heart. Show me an old liberal and I’ll show you someone with no brain.” It is surely true
that some people become less idealistic with age, with economic security and family
responsibilities. But it is equally true that some young conservatives become more liberal as they

cannibalizing the fitness tracker market, 2) fad risk, as fitness trackers could be simply a
fitness fad with consumers, 3) competitive risk from competitors out-innovating, and 4)
execution risk on channel build and inventory management.

GoPro (GPRO)

Our $8 price objective is based on 10x our 2018E EBITDA, in line with the peer average
of 10x, which we believe is appropriate given its slightly higher growth and potential for
EBITDA margin expansion after restructuring. GoPro is the leading action camera
company in the world but has been challenged by execution issues limiting its ability to
drive strong product cycles.

Downside risks to our PO are: 1) new products fail to resonate with consumers, 2)
competitive pressure pushing down ASPs, and 3) failure to meet market demand during
holidays.

Upside risks to our PO are: 1) better than expected sales on new products, 2) better than
expected holiday sales from extra manufacturing capacity, 3) better than expected drone
sales, or new product announcements, and 4) new direct sales partnerships
internationally

GrubHub (GRUB)

Our PO is $49, based on 32x our 2018E P/E (vs. high growth internet at 31x). We believe
GRUB warrants a premium to eCommerce peers due to the attractive margins of the
core business and, relative to the overall small-cap sector, GRUB has more attractive
margins and growth potential.

Downside risks to our PO are:

Revenue and sales metrics are trailing KPls for Diners and Restaurant and the potential
for diminishing returns on future restaurant and user additions is a risk. GrubHub has
significant room for growth in the US ahead, but will need to invest internationally if
domestic growth stalls.

LendingTree (TREE)

Our $140 price objective represents 14x 2018E EV/EBITDA, a premium to the lead
generation services and marketplace peer group average of 11x due to market position
(category leader in mortgage and personal loans) and faster revenue growth.

Risks to achieving our estimates and price objective are: 1) interest rate risks given the
demand for leads for mortgage and other loan products, 2) competition with other
consumer finance sites and ad networks, 3) potential for search engine
disintermediation and traffic competition, 4) potential for recessionary impact on loan
products (lower traffic and demand for leads) and credit card markets, 5) premium
valuation vs. lead generation and marketplace peers, and 6) acquisition risk.

Match Group (MTCH)

Our PO is $21 based on 12x our estimated 2018 EBITDA of $562mn and our DCF
valuation analysis. The basis for our PO is in-line with the eCommerce group, but a
premium to the consumer internet subscription services group due to MTCH's
combination of market dominance, profitability, and cash flow. We think fundamentals
help MTCH stand out from its ecommerce peer group and MTCH should be seen as a
more defensible platform that is unlikely to see disruption in its core markets.

Downside risks are: market share losses to an emerging dating business, potential for
higher acquisition costs on mobile, lower conversion rates that lead to lower PMC
growth, the need to acquire competing sites to maintain growth or market share, and

Peter characterizes sickle cell anemia as a “crude adaptation to malaria”. Crude? In
what sense?

A single copy of the sickle gene gives you anemia, in which the normal shape of the
red blood cell—a flat round pill—changes under low oxygen tension into a sickle
shape which crushes the malarial Plasmodium inside it. The low oxygen tension is
caused by the parasite itself, since it consumes oxygen in the red blood cell. The cell
then quickly flips back into normal shape as the oxygen tension returns to normal
levels. A sickle individual without malaria suffers no cost at all, since all red blood
cells have oxygen tension well above the level that would cause sickling.

| enough dirt on the girls to ne

| prosecutors skeptical. Not only did

| some of the girls have issues with
drugs or alcohol but also some had
criminal records and other troubles,
Epstein’s legal team claimed. And at
least one of them, they said, lied
when she told police she was
younger than 18 when she started
performing massages for Epstein.

After the meeting, prosecutors
postponed their decision to take the
case to a grand jury.

In the following weeks, police
received complaints that two of the
victims or their families had been
harassed or threatened. Epstein’s
legal team maintains that its private
investigators did nothing illegal or
unethical during their research.

By then, relations’ between
police and prosecutors were fraying.
At a key meeting with prosecutors
and the defense, Detective Joseph
Recarey, the lead investigator, was a
no-show, according to Epstein’s
attorney.

“The embarrassment .on the
prosecutor’s face was evident when,
the police officer never showed up

_for the meeting,” attorney Jack
Goldberger said.

Later in April, Recarey walked
into a prosecutor’s office at the state
attorney’s office and learned the
case was taking an unexpected turn.

' The prosecutor, Lanna

’ Belohlavek, told Recarey the state
attorney’s office had offered Epstein
a plea deal that would not require
him to serve jail time or receive a
felony conviction.

Recarey told her he disapproved

' of the plea offer.

The deal never came to pass, |

however.

Future unclear after charge
On May 1, the department asked

' prosecutors to approve warrants to
arrest Epstein on four counts of »
unlawful sexual activity with aminor —

and to charge his personal assistant,

_ Sarah Kellen, now 27, for her alleged

role in arranging the visits. Police
officials also wanted to-charge Rob-
son, the self-described H:-.idi Fleiss,
with lewd and lascivious dcts.

By then, the department was

. frustrated with the way the state

attorney’s office had handled the
case. On the same day the warrants
were requested, Palm Beach Police
, Chief Michael Reiter wrote a letter
to State Attorney Barry Krischer
suggesting he disqualify himself

Two weeks later, Recarey was
told that prosecutors had decided
once again to take the case to the
grand jury. *

Itis not known how many of the
girls testified before the grand jury.
But Epstein’s defense team said one
girl who was subpoenaed — the one
who said she had sexual intercourse

_ with Epstein — never showed up.

The grand jury’s indictment was

handed down in July. It was not the |

one the police department had
wanted, —

Instead of being slapped with a
charge of unlawful sexual activity
with a minor, Epstein was charged

with one count of felony solicitation -

of prostitution, which carries a

maximum penalty of five years in ,

prison. He was booked into the Palm
Beach County Jail early July 23 and
released hours later.

Epstein’s legal team “doesn’t
dispute that he had girls over for

assages,” Goldberger said. But he
said their claims that they had sex-
ual encounters with him lack credi-
bility.

“They are. incapable of being
believed,” he said. “They had crimi-
nal records. They had accusations of
theft made against them by their
employers. There was evidence of
drug use by some-of them.” ~

What remains for Epstein is yet
to be seen. '

The Palm Beach Police Depart: '
ment has asked the FBI to investi- ,
gate the case. It also has returned |
the $90,000 Epstein donated in 2004.

In New York, candidates for
governor and state attorney gene
have vowed to return a total of at
least $60,000 in campaign contribu-
tions from Epstein. Meanwhile,
Epstein’s powerful friends have.
remained silent as tabloids and
Internet blogs feast on the public
details of the police investigation.

Goldberger maintains Epstein’s
innocence but says the legal team
has not ruled out a future plea deal.

He insists Epstein will emerge in the

end with his reputation untarnished.

“He will recover from this,” he
said. t

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012979.txt,"4.2 Symbolic Cognitive Architectures 63

4.2.4 NARS

Pei Wang’s NARS logic [Wan06] played a large role in the development of PLN, CogPrime’s
uncertain logic component, a relationship that is discussed in depth in [GMIH08] and won’t
be re-emphasized here. However, NARS is more than just an uncertain logic, it is also an
overall cognitive architecture (which is centered on NARS logic, but also includes other aspects).
CogPrime bears little relation to NARS except in the specific similarities between PLN logic
and NARS logic, but, the other aspects of NARS are worth briefly recounting here.

NARS is formulated as a system for processing tasks, where a task consists of a question or a
piece of new knowledge. The architecture is focused on declarative knowledge, but some pieces
of knowledge may be associated with executable procedures, which allows NARS to carry out
control activities (in roughly the same way that a Prolog program can).

At any given time a NARS system contains

e working memory: a small set of tasks which are active, kept for a short time, and closely
related to new questions and new knowledge

e long-term memory: a huge set of knowledge which is passive, kept for a long time, and not
necessarily related to current questions and knowledge

The working and long term memory spaces of NARS may each be thought of as a set of
chunks, where each chunk consists of a set of tasks and a set of knowledge. NARS’s basic
cognitive process is:

choose a chunk

choose a task from that chunk

choose a piece of knowledge from that chunk
use the task and knowledge to do inference
send the new tasks to corresponding chunks

Depending on the nature of the task and knowledge, the inference involved may be one of
the following:

e if the task is a question, and the knowledge happens to be an answer to the question, a
copy of the knowledge is generated as a new task

backward inference

revision (merging two pieces of knowledge with the same form but different truth value)
forward inference

execution of a procedure associated with a piece of knowledge

Unlike many other systems, NARS doesn’t decide what type of inference is used to process
a task when the task is accepted, but works in a data-driven way — that is, it is the task and
knowledge that dynamically determine what type of inference will be carried out

The “choice” processes mentioned above are done via assigning relative priorities to

e chunks (where they are called activity)
e tasks (where they are called urgency)
e knowledge (where they are called importance)

possible that Snowden smuggled in a key logger in his backpack, it could not be operated
wirelessly inside the Center because, like all other NSA facilities, the computers had been
insulated to lock-out wireless transmission. This precaution was taken to guard against an EMP,
or Electro-Magnetic Pulse, attack by an enemy. If so, the only way Snowden could intercept key
strokes was to attach a cable from his key logger to each of his fellow workers’ computers. In
this scenario, he would have to surreptitiously build his own wired network connecting his hidden
key logger to 24 separated computers. Moreover, he would have to do this wiring in an open-plan
office where he could not count on these additional wires, even if rigged one by one, not being
noticed by either other analysts on the room or the geek squad of system administrators who
regularly checked connections. Making the task even more risky, according to my Booz Allen
source, there were closed-circuit cameras. The only way he could mitigate the risk of detection
was by having someone help him build this network.

There was a further security barrier he had to get by. Even after he managed to obtain all the
necessary passwords from colleagues, he had to transfer the files to an external storage device.
This was not a matter of simply using a thumb drive because, unlike in caper movies such as
Mission Impossible, the ports on the computers at the NSA were ordinarily sealed shut. This
measure was done specifically to prevent any unauthorized downloading by NSA workers. The
only people at the Center who had the authorization, and the means, to open these ports and
transfer data were system administrators, according to the former Booz Allen executive. System
administrators needed to have this privilege to deal with glitches in the computers. So they were
allowed to open up the sealed ports. But Snowden was no longer a system administrator and did
not have these privileges. So again, he needed some help. He either would need to borrow
another system administrator’s credential or forge his own. The credential he would need is
called a public key infrastructure card with its authentication code embedded in a magnetic stripe.
When I asked the former Booz Allen executive if Snowden possessed the skill set to forge such a
card, he said that he strongly doubted any NSA employee would be capable of such a forgery
without special equipment. He could have, however, borrowed this credential from a system
administrator who was willing to help him. But just asking such a favor could “set off alarms.”

The unwitting accomplice scenario had another stumbling block: time. We know from Poitras
that Snowden told her in early April 2013 that he planned to deliver documents to her in six to
eight weeks (which he in fact did.) But he had not yet started working for Booz Allen at the
Center until that same month. It does not seem plausible (to me) that in making such a
commitment he was merely counting on the kindness of strangers to fulfill it The only way he
could have known for certain that he would be able to borrow a public key infrastructure card and
obtain the passwords, whether by trickery or by a key router, before he had begun working at the
Center was that he already knew someone at the Center who would help him. But such a contact
leads to a witting accomplice scenario.

quoted is the only kind that appears in the record.

Evidence from Stock Markets

Market-valued capital, reported in national accounts since 1990 or so and
assembled at the convenient Piketty-Zucman website, is measured by a common
standard in principle. Measurement begins with stock markets. It should. The stock
market is the most exact source of economic information that I know. With due
reservations about connivance and “stale prices,” meaning outdated prices from
earlier days because the stock has not traded since, or anyhow not enough for
confidence, we know pretty well what markets think stocks are worth from tick to

tick.

We would know better if markets were perfectly efficient. Proof that they aren’t
shows in medium-term autocorrelation or trend. Autocorrelation (in price) is
tendency for markets to be up tomorrow if up today, and down if down. Trend is a
shorter word for the same. Perfect efficiency ought to show a “random walk” where
prices change captures all current news, news captures reality without optimistic or
pessimistic bias, and tomorrow’s price direction is as unpredictable as tomorrow's
news. The only exception should be long-term uptrend with productivity gain
through innovation. In this case it is not surprise in the news that brings growth, but
gradual gain in present value as a foreseen better future is less discounted as it

draws nearer.

There is chicanery as well as inefficiency. Insiders, braving the legal risks, may take
advantage of outsiders. But it is not clear to me that insiders are likelier to be sellers
than buyers. National accounts follow prices of publicly traded shares collectively,

where some chicaneries should offset others.

Allowing for all this, I think national accounts are wise to accept stock prices as the

best measure of underlying assets. Intangibles such as patents or market advantages

Chapter Nineteen

A few hours before Haim Ramon introduced his no-confidence resolution, he
came to see me in my office in the Knesset. He was worried. Not about the vote,
but about what would come after. “Ehud, I’m sure we can topple the government,”
he told me. “But only you know whether we’re ready — whether you ’re ready — to
defeat Bibi in an election.”

“I’m ready,” I said. “We are going to win.”

Few agreed. In fact, there had been times during my first year-and-a-half as
Labor leader when I wondered if I’d be able to hang on to the job. I was in charge
of a party whose grassroots were on the left. I was, by intellect and instinct, a
pragmatist and a centrist. I did share Labor’s vision of a socially just and
democratic Israel. Especially after seeing far-right rabbis egg on the fanaticism that
ultimately killed Yitzhak Rabin, I felt strongly that we needed to separate
organized religion from our day-to-day politics. But I’d been raised with a deeper
respect for our Jewish traditions than many on the left. Right after Yitzhak’s
murder, I’d gone to see Zevulun Hammer, the leader of the National Religious
Party. It had been part of both Labor and Likud governments ever since 1948,
though not Rabin’s. The NRP, too, had been drifting steadily rightward. But it still
basically subscribed the idea of a strong, democratic Israel under the rule of law. I
wanted to bring the NRP back into the government under Peres, as part of the
widest possible political alliance against the assassination and the campaign of
hatred that had fostered it. Sadly that didn’t happen, in part because of the anger
against all Orthodox politicians after Rabin’s murder. Yet in my readiness to
engage politically with Orthodox leaders who did not reject the very idea of peace
negotiations — whether in the NRP, or the increasingly influential Sephardi
religious party, Shas — I was outside Labor’s mainstream, and its comfort zone.

On my approach to peace as well, I differed from many on the left. Though I
was determined to pursue any realistic avenue to negotiations, I was convinced that
security considerations had to be paramount in what we were prepared to give up
or accept in negotiations. I was cautious about ceding too much too soon, in case
the Palestinians or the Syrians proved either unequal to, or uninterested in, making
the hard decisions required for peace. That was an approach with, like Yitzhak

10 A.L.R. Fed. 2d 789

C. Success Foundation
341 The Burnett Plaintiffs claim that Success Foundation
is a sister company to Defendant ITRO and that it “sends
money back and forth with the RO and IRO” and other
sponsors of terror. (Burnett Compl. § 235.) If given the
opportunity to replead its allegations against Success, the
Plaintiffs would allege that, in 1998, Success Foundation
entered into a contract to act as an agent for Defendant
Taibah, which has since been designated a global terrorist.

The complaint does not allege that Success Foundation
knew the money it was transferring between ITRO and
IRO would somehow assist al Qaeda, nor does it allege
facts showing that Success Foundation knew the other
unnamed organizations to which it transferred money
were in the business of supporting terrorism. See Boim IT,
291 F.3d at 1012 (“To hold the defendants liable for
donating money without knowledge of the donee’s
intended criminal use of the funds would impose strict
liability. Nothing in the language of the statute or its
structure or history supports that formulation.”). The
Burnett complaint is against Success Foundation is
dismissed without prejudice.

D. Wa‘el Jalaidan
35] For the reasons the Court found that it has personal
jurisdiction over Mr. Jalaidan, the Court finds the
Plaintiffs have stated a claim for relief against him.
Plaintiffs have alleged facts, that if true, would be
sufficient to prove that he knowingly provided material
support to al Qaeda in the form of financial and logistical
support. See 18 U.S.C. § 2339(A) (including *569
“currency or other financial securities, financial services,

. weapons, [and] personnel” in definition of material
support). The Federal complaint does not allege that
Jalaidan directed an enterprise and the RICO claim is
dismissed. Wa‘el Jalaidan’s motions to dismiss the
Ashton, Burnett, and Federal complaints are denied

E. IIRO
361 Similarly, for the reasons the Court found that
Plaintiffs made a prima facie demonstration that ITRO has
purposefully directed its activities at the United States, the
Court finds they have stated a claim under the ATA in
that ITRO has allegedly funded al Qaeda training camps in
Afghanistan, supported al Qaeda guest houses, and been
involved in other terrorist attacks and plots. See 18 U.S.C.

WESTLAW

§ 2339(A) (including “currency or other financial
securities, financial services, weapons, [and]
personnel” in definition of material support). IIRO’s
motions to dismiss the Ashton, Burnett, and Federal
complaints are denied.

F. Rabita Trust
371 Rabita Trust moves to dismiss the complaints against
it for failure to state a claim. These motions are denied
without prejudice until this Court determines whether it
has personal jurisdiction over Rabita Trust.

G. SAAR Network Defendants

1. Entities
The Burnett and Ashton complaints’ allegations against
the SAAR Network entities are substantially similar to
one another.’ Paragraph 267 of the Burnett complaint and
paragraph 339 of the Ashton complaint both state:

Co-conspirators, material sponsors, and/or aiders and
abettors of the SAAR Network include Defendants ...
African Muslim Agency, ... Grove Corporate, Inc.,
Heritage Education Trust, International Institute of
Islamic Thought, Mar—Jac Investments, Inc., Mar—Jac
Poultry, Inc., ... Reston Investments, Inc., ... Safa Trust,
.. and York Foundation, all located doing business or
registered to do business in the United States.
In support of their claims against these Defendants,
Plaintiffs rely primarily on their allegations against the
“SAAR Foundation and network.” (See Burnett Compl.
qf 261-67; Ashton Compl. J 333-39.) The SAAR
Foundation, allegedly a financial sponsor of terror, was
formed in the 1970s by a group of Muslim scholars and
scientists. (Burnett Compl. J 261; Ashton Compl. ¥ 333.)
It was incorporated in Virginia in 1983 and dissolved in
December 2000. (Burnett Compl. § 261; Ashton Compl. J
333.) Its largest donor is the al Rajhi family of Saudi
Arabia. (Burnett Compl. § 261; Ashton Compl. § 333.)

The complaints claim that over one hundred “affiliated
organizations” are registered or are doing business at one
of the SAAR Foundation’s addresses in Herndon,
Virginia, but many “do not maintain a physical presence

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031439.txt,"Incident 3:

° A former Case Western physics department administrator confirmed that she had reported a previous
incident involving a student who had confided in her about your inappropriate behavior towards her.

Incident 4:

° You met a student from another university, an atheist activist, in March 2008 at the American Atheists
Convention in Minneapolis. She wanted to expand the atheist group she ran at the midwestern university she
was attending, and hoped to convince you to come and speak. You initially seemed enthusiastic.

° During the convention, attendees including you and Richard Dawkins went for dinner with the student
and volunteers for Dawkins’ foundation.

° Afterwards, the student invited you to join the volunteers for a drink.

° You asked her to come get you in your hotel room. She was wary of your intentions, and so brought a
male friend with her. Opening the door to find them both there, you informed her you had decided not to go.
° You met this student again at the American Atheists Convention in Des Moines, lowa, in April 2011.

° You pulled over a chair for her in the bar, and then started running your hand up her leg under the
table.

° She tried to shift her body away from you, and you persisted in putting your hand on her leg. She

crossed her legs, and you kept trying. Then she turned her entire body away.

Incident 5:

° This incident allegedly occurred on in May 2011 on a CFI cruise. We understand that CFI staff were
informed that you had propositioned a female cruise-goer, who rejected an invitation to join you and your
female companion for sex in your cabin.

° At least two CFI staffers were sufficiently concerned about reports of your behavior that they urged
CFI’s president not to invite you on a 2014 cruise of the Galapagos Islands. You were invited on that cruise,
however.

Incident 6:

° During a visit to Melbourne, Australia, in November 2016, you were accused of sexual misconduct once
again.

° The incident happened at a dinner held at the Melbourne Zoo as part of the Australian Skeptics
National Convention, where you were a featured speaker.

° With conference delegates chatting over drinks, a woman asked you for a celebrity selfie.

° As the woman held out her phone to take the picture, you reached over her shoulder and grabbed her
right breast.

° She immediately reacted, bodychecking you and spinning around. “Don’t do that,” she said.

° BuzzFeed News has seen the complaint made by another woman to ASU, ANU, and the New College

of the Humanities in London, including the selfie, her face obscured to conceal her identity. It shows your
hand in motion as a blur in front of her shoulder, apparently moving toward her chest. Two other eyewitnesses
have confirmed the complainant’s account of what happened.

° In April 2017, the complainant described the incident on her blog. After hearing more about your
reputation for inappropriate behavior from blog readers, she decided to file a complaint about the Nov. 2016
incident.

° On July 16, she filed formal complaints with Arizona State University, and with the Australian National
University in Canberra and the New College of the Humanities in London, where you have visiting
appointments.

New Curricula for a
New Way of Teaching

A smart man makes a mistake, learns from it, and never

makes that mistake again. But a wise man finds a smart man

and learns from him how to avoid the mistake altogether.
—Roy H. Williams

How do we put all this into practice? First, let’s make sure we avoid
creating departments around each of the 12 cognitive processes. The
organization around subjects, which is the basis of how our schools
are organized, is the source of the problem in both universities and
high schools.

Subjects create departments. Departments in universities are a se-
rious problem for students and administrators. They represent silos
where decisions are made that will help the department prosper. De-
partments lobby for their courses to be required so they can hire more
faculty. They make sure majors in their departments follow certain
rules for graduation that are intended to make students scholars in
their field rather than practitioners. Departments are the reason stu-
dents graduate without job skills. Faculty are almost always against
practical training. English departments have to be forced to teach stu-
dents to write. Computer science departments have to be forced to
teach students to program in a way that would make them hirable by
industry. Psychology departments avoid teaching clinical psychology,
which is really what students what to learn more about.

For about 10 years I have been building new online story-centered
curricula. The idea behind a story-centered curriculum (SCC) is that a

trouble. Still, there were well-established rules for setting up a defensible
position when an armored force halts for the night. As Eitan briefed his officers,
I stood a few feet off to the side and listened. Suddenly, the commander of his
AMX company interrupted. “Sir,” he said, ‘““why are we staying here — right on
the main road? There are Egyptians still out there. Behind us, for sure. And any
force ahead of us will run straight into us. Why not a few hundred yards off to
the side, in a place that gives us a view of any enemy movement, or allows us to
ambush an approaching force?” I could see that he was right. I expected Eitan to
agree and alter the arrangements. But he didn’t. I think that, having ordered his
men to encamp on the road 20 minutes earlier, he was reluctant to get his tanks
and halftracks moving again. No doubt, some of the exhausted crews were
already asleep.

I parked our Jeep a few yards off the road. We organized a series of watches:
Avraham, then Rafi and Danny, with me taking the pre-dawn stretch. A few
hours later, Rafi nudged me awake. “I heard something,” he said, pointing west
toward the Suez Canal. “It was faint. But I think so.” I told him to keep
listening. For a while, everything seemed fine. Then, Danny woke me up. He
said he was sure he heard a faint tremor, as if from tanks or APCs. I put my ear
to the ground. I heard it too. I told him to go to Eitan’s command halftrack,
insist he be woken up, and tell him. When he got back, Danny said: “I told
him.”

“And?”

“Don’t know,” he replied. “He said I could go.” I tried to grab a bit more
sleep before my watch. But barely 15 minutes later, Danny jostled me awake
again. “I’m sure now,” he said. “Whatever it is, it’s closer.” I went off to find
Eitan. But before I got there, a column of Egyptian T-55 tanks suddenly
appeared on the road, 50 yards from the front of our column. I’m sure they were
every bit as surprised as we were to be face-to-face with enemy armor. But they
knew what to do. They opened fire.

Had we been deployed a few hundred yards off the road, we’d have seen
them coming. If the battalion commander had acted on Danny’s warning, we’d
have had an extra 20 minutes to prepare. But the shells jolted our crews awake.
Within 30 seconds, they were returning fire. But our tanks barely dented the
heavily armored T- 55s. Nearly every one of theirs seemed to score a direct hit.
Within minutes, a number of our halftracks, and one of our tanks, were in
flames.

CBD Products Gaining Traction With Independent Pharmacies

CBD products appear to be gaining traction with independent pharmacies, many of
whom are already selling or planning to sell CBD oils. We don't find this surprising given
the high demand for and strong expected growth potential of CBD products, as well as
the differentiation it affords independents relative to larger chain pharmacies.
Independent pharmacies also likely find the high-margin profile of CBD oils attractive,
which we suspect is similar to those of more traditional over-the-counter drugs. OTC
drugs are a substantial profit driver for independent pharmacies. The greater
acceptance of and improving sentiment towards CBD products as a viable business for
independent pharmacies is evidenced by a panel held by the National Community
Pharmacists Association (NCPA) at its annual convention in October 2018, which served
to educate independent pharmacy owners of the legality, clinical uses, potential risks
and marketing tactics of CBD oils. For those independent pharmacies that have decided
to sell CBD oils, ensuring that they provide high-quality products is paramount, witha
focus on looking at the bioavailability of CBD. Additionally, independent pharmacies
emphasize the importance of patient education, in regards to treatment and potential
side effects. Anecdotally, reports note that many independent pharmacies have received
positive feedback from patients, attributing diminished opioid dependence and pain
relief to CBD oils.

Large Pharmacy Chains Don’t Appear As Quick To Offer CBD Oils

Large pharmacy chains, such as CVS Pharmacy and Walgreens, don’t currently sell CBD
oil. WBA management has noted that, while the company is monitoring the CBD market
and the potential to sell it, WBA currently has no public stance on whether it plans to
sell CBD products future. Interestingly, Boots, which is a pharmacy chain in the U.K.
owned by WBA, sells CBD oil in three different doses (Figure 107). As such, we wouldn't
be surprised if WBA decides to sell CBD products in the future.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028509.txt,"Care needs to be taken with military kit, but America’s regulations still seem excessive. A regular review to distinguish
between systems that pose a real threat and ones that don’t would be a help, as would better intelligence. Tight
restrictions on new technologies will not work, and will damage America’s interests: exciting new ventures like nanosats
will simply move to countries from which they can be launched with greater ease.

Back to top

Nanosatellites: Nanosats are go!
The Economist

ALTHOUGH widely used, satellites are expensive to build and to launch. That began to change last year. On November
19th Orbital Sciences, an American company, launched a rocket from the Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. It carried 29
satellites aloft and released them into low-Earth orbit, a record for a single mission. Thirty hours later, Kosmotras, a
Russian joint-venture, carried 32 satellites into a similar orbit. Then, in January 2014, Orbital Sciences carried 33
satellites up to the International Space Station (ISS), where they were cast off a month later.

Many of these 94 satellites were built in a standard format known as a CubeSat, a 10cm (4 inch) cube weighing 1.3kg
(2.9lb) or less. Some comprised units of two or three cubes. After a decade of fits and starts, during which some 75
CubeSats were launched, satellites of this scale and other small satellites are moving from being experimental kit to
delivering useful scientific data and commercial services.

In the next five years or so some 1,000 nanosats, as small satellites of 1-10kg are called, are expected to be launched.
Some will be smaller than a CubeSat; others bigger and heavier. Some are like a matryoshka doll: the Russian launch
included a satellite that launched eight smaller ones, including four PocketQubes (a 5cm cube format). One of these
smaller satellites, developed in Peru, released its own tiny bird.

There will be upsets along the way. In April, as part of a mission by SpaceX, an American company, to resupply the
ISS, a small mothership was placed in orbit carrying 104 “sprites” (pictured below). Not much larger than a postage
stamp, these contain all the basic elements of a satellite, such as a radio, aerials, a solar cell and instruments.
Developed as part of a crowd-funded project called KickSat at Cornell University, each sprite cost just $25 in parts.
Their launch was free, courtesy of NASA, the American space agency. The sprites were designed to remain in orbit for
a few weeks collecting data before burning up on re-entry. Unfortunately, due to a fault with a timer, the mothership
failed to release them before it burned up on re-entry. A second mission is now being planned.

No going back

Despite that setback, the way ahead for satellite technology is clear. “You can now, with a single chip, create most of
the capabilities that you would have found in Sputnik, but, of course, orders of magnitude faster,” says Mason Peck, a
former chief technologist at NASA and now a professor at Cornell University.

The most ambitious project to date is a flock of 28 nanosats, each one three CubeSats in size (ie, 30cm long). These
were carried to the ISS in January and released in batches (pictured at the beginning of this article) through a sort of
satellite shooter developed by NanoRacks, an American company. These nanosats came from Planet Labs, a firm
based in San Francisco. The satellites now take pictures as they scan the Earth more frequently than traditional ones
and at a fraction of the cost, albeit at a lower resolution.

Planet Labs, funded modestly with $65m of private investment, says its nanosats provide much of the performance of a
conventional satellite for a fraction of the cost. That reflects a lot of antiquated technology in the space business, much
of which can be bettered by the latest off-the-shelf equipment, says Will Marshall, Planet Labs’ boss. There are other
cost-saving measures. Satellites are usually built in elaborate clean rooms, but Planet Labs assembles its nanosats in
“clean-enough’” rooms in its downtown offices. The company expects to put another 100 nanosats into orbit in the next
12 to 18 months.

A few miles away, in another modest San Francisco office, Nanosatisfi is working on its ArduSats. These are open-
source platforms and two have already gone up. They will contain an array of sensors and can carry out various
missions, such as locating things. More than 250,000 ships, for instance, now broadcast an automatic identification
signal than carries about 50 nautical miles. A fleet of small satellites in low orbit could pick up these signals and provide
frequent updates about the ships’ positions without the vessels having to use costly dedicated satellite uplinks. Such a
system might have been able to track Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, which went missing in March.

I can hardly be possessive under circumstances but schedule changing because she gets a better offer is not

If I say this she will rage back about times I changed plans because of family and work constraints.

The Burnett Plaintiffs claim that mem-
bers of the Spanish al Qaeda cell used
Arab Bank to make wire transfers. Bur-
nett Complaint 1138 (alleging Arab Bank
is “used regularly by al Qaeda’s Spanish
cell for transfers of cash to members of al
Qaeda operating in Germany, Pakistan, Af-
ghanistan, Lebanon, Yemen, Bosnia, and
elsewhere”); id. 99139, 528 (alleging
$6,400 wire transfer through Arab Bank
from member of Spanish al Qaeda cell to
an extremist associated with Chej Salah in
Spain). These Plaintiffs conclude that
“Arab Bank PLC has materially sup-
ported, aided, and abetted and financed al
Qaeda.” Id. 1138.

The Federal and Burnett complaints do
not include any facts to support the infer-
ence that Arab Bank knew or had to know
that it was providing material support to
terrorists by providing financial services to
the charity Defendants or by processing
wire transfers in Spain. The paragraphs
do not allege any involvement by, knowl-
edge of, or participation in any wrongful
conduct by Arab Bank. These Plaintiffs do
not claim that Arab Bank ignored any
regulations regarding their customer ac-
counts. Providing routine banking ser-
vices, without having knowledge of the ter-
rorist activities, cannot subject Arab Bank
to liability. While claiming Arab Bank has
ties with known Hamas fronts, the Federal
complaint does not contain any allegation
of a connection between Hamas and Osa-
ma bin Laden, al Qaeda, or the September
11 attacks. A complaint alleging conclu-
sions without supporting facts will not sur-
vive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. In re Cross

Bank’s motions to dismiss the Federal and

Burnett complaints are granted in their
entirety.

service was drawing to an end, it hadn’t happened. I did not seriously think of
leaving. Though my two years in Sayeret Matkal had been the most physically
demanding of my life, they were also the most fulfilling. I did not want to
forfeit the chance of being part of its finally becoming an operational unit. So I
committed to at least a few more years in the military. I joined my closest friend
among the recruits, Uri Zakay, for six months in officers’ school as we waited,
or hoped, for approval to actually use the skills and qualities we had acquired in
the sayeret.

And in the summer of 1962, shortly after I returned to the unit from officers’
school as a second-lieutenant, the green light finally came.

Topicals

Outside of nutraceuticals, we expect the topical CBD market to provide the largest
contribution to industry sales. We believe the non-ingestible nature of the product
makes it more attractive to consumers looking to experiment in CBD and can provide a
source of trial into the category. While the CBD market clearly needs more clinical
research into the benefits of the cannabinoid, it has been suggested that two of the
primary benefits are anti-inflammation and muscle recovery, which can cater to a large
and diverse consumer base.

Over the next two years, we expect the topical CBD market to grow to $1.5 bn (almost
$1 bn less than our outlook for nutraceuticals). We estimate that in 2018, the total
addressable U.S. topical market, which includes both OTC and rx offerings was ~$12.8
bn. If we assume no growth in the category base, a $1.5 bn CBD category by 2020
would imply a ~12% share of the market, the largest market share among all of the
categories analyzed, excluding nutraceuticals.

Our below scenario analysis provides a wider incremental range of market share
outcomes relative to other categories. We can see that every 5 pts of market share
capture is worth over $600 mm in revenues. While our analysis contemplates a 2% share
of the topical market, we believe that this is unlikely and view the floor at ~7%, which
would imply almost $900 mm in revenues by 2020. Given the number of companies
providing topical solutions, coupled with what we expect to be robust consumer
demand, a market share between 12-17% is not unrealistic.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012951.txt,"Chapter 3
A Patternist Philosophy of Mind

3.1 Introduction

In the last chapter we discussed human intelligence from a fairly down-to-earth perspective,
looking at the particular intelligent functions that human beings carry out in their everyday
lives. And we strongly feel this practical perspective is important: Without this concreteness, it’s
too easy for AGI research to get distracted by appealing (or frightening) abstractions of various
sorts. However, it’s also important to look at the nature of mind and intelligence from a more
general and conceptual perspective, to avoid falling into an approach that follows the particulars
of human capability but ignores the deeper structures and dynamics of mind that ultimately
allow human minds to be so capable. In this chapter we very briefly review some ideas from the
patternist philosophy of mind, a general conceptual framework on intelligence which has
been inspirational for many key aspects of the CogPrime design, and which has been ongoingly
developed by one of the authors (Ben Goertzel) during the last two decades (in a series of
publications beginning in 1991, most recently The Hidden Pattern |[Goe06al). Some of the ideas
described are quite broad and conceptual, and are related to CogPrime only via serving as
general inspirations; others are more concrete and technical, and are actually utilized within
the design itself.

CogPrime is an integrative design formed via the combination of a number of different
philosophical, scientific and engineering ideas. The success or failure of the design doesn’t depend
on any particular philosophical understanding of intelligence. In that sense, the more abstract
notions presented in this chapter should be considered “optional” rather than critical in a
CogPrime context. However, due to the core role patternism has played in the development of
CogPrime, understanding a few things about general patternist philosophy will be helpful for
understanding CogPrime, even for those readers who are not philosophically inclined. Those
readers who are philosophically inclined, on the other hand, are urged to read The Hidden
Pattern and then interpret the particulars of CogPrime in this light.

3.2 Some Patternist Principles

The patternist philosophy of mind is a general approach to thinking about intelligent systems.
It is based on the very simple premise that mind is made of pattern — and that a mind is a

It believes that in the inevitable Supreme Court battle that would
follow a direct attempt by the President to fire the Special Counsel, the
Court would surely rebuff such an expansion of Presidential authority.
At the same time, according to its internal research, the Mueller team
understands that the President, acting with only somewhat more
subtlety, would have the authority to order the Attorney General—even
given his prior recusal—to repeal the Special Counsel regulations and
close down the investigation, and fire the Attorney General if he refuses.
The President, could, too, according to the Special Counsel's analysis,
fire Rosenstein and seek someone else to oversee the investigation in
ways more to his liking. Both of these actions could, the Special Counsel
believes, become part of the behavior that it argues in the indictment
amounts to a prima facie case for obstruction of justice.

The team does yet believe it is protected by political realities—the
President can not know how Congress might respond—and by
bureaucratic ones. Changes to the Special Counsel authorization might
require an extended comment period.

Still, what if the President acting unilaterally does shut it down?
This, people around the President say is the unknown legal area that
might be advantageous to the President. Delays and disruption might
well be the President's legal friends.

What, for instance, happens to all the work the Special Counsel's
office had done, and, indeed, to the sitting Grand Juries reviewing the
evidence? The special counsel's view, according to insiders working on
the issues, is that nobody knows. The optimistic legal view is that the
Office and staff would survive the Special Counsel's ouster and their
work preserved. And that actions taken by the Grand Jury would remain
in effect.

This, however, would probably not be true if the Attorney General
refused the next Special Counsel's budget request—due on July 1. That
would shut down the whole operation—the Special Counsel staff and
grand juries. There might, however, according to research the team has
prepared, be enough time between the order and the shuttering for the
Special Counsel to share the grand jury evidence with other federal
prosecutors.

The President's constitutional pardon powers appear to be some
of the most troubling and threatening issues for the Special Counsel. The
Counsel's office believes the President will use his pardon power as an

from all contributors to revenue together. Then revenue and earned revenue would

be the same if there are no other claims.

Earned Revenue and Cash Flow

A classical illustration of revenue generated collaboratively is the firm. The firm
proper can be interpreted as a single asset of physical capital. Its typically many
owners agree to hire outside management, meaning outside themselves, to contract
and trade on their behalf. The firm through its managers hires the other employees,
contracts with suppliers, and generates a joint product representing all its own
gross cash flow plus any contributed parts of gross cash flow of others. The product
is sold for revenue in the collective sense. Revenue is first applied to satisfy claims
on it by those outside contributors. Claims recovered include current purchases
from suppliers realized in sales. Others are pay to management and other
employees, along with rent, interest, utilities, other services, and whatever is due to
the tax man. The principle is to include all outlays by the firm needed to secure
revenue now, as distinct from outlays invested for the sake of more revenue later.
The share of revenue due the firm proper is any residue after all those prior claims

are met. Then

gross cash flow = revenue - prior claims = earned revenue (6.5)
gives the contribution of the firm proper.
Earned revenue may or may not be passed to owners. Management is typically
authorized to plow back any part as reinvestment, say in replenishing inventory or

cash or in buying new plant and equipment. Any revenue left over after that

plowback is transferred out to owners as dividend yield.

Chapter 6: Parallels with the Firm 2/4/16 4

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011038
"
IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012789.txt,"A further parallel between chimpanzees and small scale human societies comes from analyses of
two extreme warring societies, the Waorani of New Zealand and the Yanomamo of Venezuela. Though
violence accounts for between 40-55% of all deaths in these two groups, attackers appeared immune to
injury, with no more than 5% dying in battle, and often no deaths at all. Chimpanzee attackers are
likewise immune to injury, due in large part to the strategic use of imbalances of power.

The parallels between chimpanzees and humans living in small scale societies supports the idea
that similar pressures favored the capacity for coalitionary killing in both species. Does this mean that
each of these species should always kill in this way, and thus, as argued by Ferguson, the archaeological
record should be chock full of deaths by coalitionary attackers? To argue for this position is to
misunderstand the nature of an adaptation, and the arguments put forth by Wrangham as well as the
evolutionary psychologists Martin Daly, Margo Wilson, and David Buss. As I discussed earlier on in this
chapter, adaptations are contingent upon particular environmental circumstances. What is adaptive today
need not be tomorrow. This is why it is not only unsurprising to see variation in the frequency of
coalitionary killing among chimpanzee sites, among humans living in small scale societies, and among
modern day humans who sometimes kill their spouses, stepchildren, and rivals, but predicted by
evolutionary theory. Adaptations are economically efficient solutions to particular social or ecological
problems. If those problems or pressures change, the original adaptation may have no impact on survival
or a negative impact. A hiatus in the archaeological record — assuming this is the last word — is
interesting with respect to the conditions that might favor or select against coalitionary killing, but in no
way undermines the logic of an evolutionary adaptation, one shared by chimpanzees and humans.

The second camp arguing against the parallels between humans and chimpanzees is defended by
the economist Samuel Bowles and his colleagues. Unlike the anthropologists, Bowles is entirely
sympathetic to biology but sees fundamental differences in the pattern of human killing and warfare. To
explain these differences he invokes two important attributes of human societies that have only weak
parallels in other species: large scale cooperation with unrelated others from the same group, together
with hatred, symbolic labeling, and the motivation to hurt all others outside the group. These two factors,
what Bowles calls parechial altruism, may have paradoxically generated both greater levels of
cooperation within groups and higher rates of warfare between groups. Those groups with the best
cooperators acquired the greatest resources and experienced the fewest losses due to cheaters and other
morally corrosive rogues. This power and inward-looking favoritism led to self-defensive emotions and
behaviors, ultimately leading to lethal aggression toward those with different beliefs and values. Thus
parochialism and altruism co-evolved, hand in hand, breeding prejudice as a result of group safety. This
evolutionary handshake resulted in warfare and our unique capacity as killers.

Bowles’ analysis is interesting and consistent with my explanation of how we evolved the

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013483.txt,"Through its Common Fund the NIH has established the Center for Regenerative Medicine (NIH CRM), to support this field, with the
goal of accelerating the translation of stem cell-based clinical therapies.

State funding filling the void

With stem cell research in general not attracting a significant amount of venture funding, the California Institute of Regenerative
Medicine (CIRM), which was established in 2004 with $3 billion for stem cell research at California universities and research institutions,
has begun to fill the void left by traditional venture capital firms. To date CIRM has allocated $150 million in funding to help move
promising stem cell-based therapies from the bench into clinical trials.

We are a lot closer to having promising therapies ready for clinical trials, so it makes sense that we step up our engagement with
industry to help fund those trials and move those therapies closer to approval by the FDA, said Duane Roth, vice chair of the governing
board of CIRM.

CIRM’s funding for translational research is good news for biotech companies, providing them with a source of funds in a field where it
remains challenging to raise private capital.

Three biotech companies have been funded so far under CIRM’s Strategic Partnership Awards initiative. A grant of $10.1 million was
awarded to ViaCyte Inc. to continue preclinical research and initiate clinical testing of an embryonic stem cell-based therapy for patients
with insulin-dependent diabetes.

Meanwhile, Bluebird Bio Inc. will use a $9.3 million grant to support a Phase I/II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LentiGlobin,
the company’s programme for the treatment of the inherited blood disorder beta-thalassemia, which will be initiated in the US in 2013.
StemCells Inc. has been awarded up to $20 million to fund preclinical development of its product consisting of purified human neural
stem cells for treating Alzheimer's disease, with the goal of filing for permission to carry out a clinical trial in that time. In July, CIRM
approved a separate award to the company for up to $20 million to fund preclinical development of a cell therapy for spinal cord injury.
Public Markets

It has been a good year for stem cell companies on the public markets, with the thirteen publicly-listed stem cell companies showing an
average increase in share price of 11.6 percent in the year-to-date.

This boost came from a regulatory approval and positive clinical trials results. It was a big breakthrough for the field as a whole when
the Canadian regulator Health Canada approved Prochymal, Osiris Therapeutics Inc.'s allogeneic stem cell treatment for graft-vs.-host
disease (GvHD) in children.

The decision marked the world's first regulatory approval of a manufactured stem cell product and the first therapy approved for GVHD
— a devastating complication of bone marrow transplantation that kills up to 80 percent of children affected, many within just weeks of
diagnosis. The company’s stock value has almost doubled in the course of this year.

Meanwhile, Newark, California-based StemCells, Inc. has seen its shares rise 148 per cent in the year to date. In addition to its CIRM
grants, the company recently reported clinical and preclinical data demonstrating the therapeutic potential of a cell therapy for treating
myelination disorders.

Pluristem Therapeutics Inc.’s stock value also has jumped 44 per cent, on the strength of reporting a single case study in which a
patient with aplastic bone marrow who received an intramuscular injection of its PLacental expanded cells under compassionate use
saw an improvement. The company was also able to successfully complete a public offering which netted about US$30 million.

Positive clinical trials will begin to encourage investment

While still in their early stages of development - and with clinical trials having only involved a limited number of patients - reports to date
have been very promising, and provide further validation for encouraging investment in stem cell therapeutics. For example, data from a
human embryonic stem cell trial conducted by Advanced Cell Technology and published in medical journal The Lancet, showed that
two patients with Stargardt’s disease, a degenerative eye condition, had regained some vision.

In addition, positive early data from a spinal cord injury trial involving StemCells’ neural stem cells indicated that two patients with no
feeling below the site of injury were able to regain sensation, while in another study from the company, patients with a rare myelination
disorder were able to create myelin, an advance that holds promise for treating multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy.

This scientific progress has helped breath a new sense of optimism into the US stem cell sector. The Fiscal Cliff apart, it seems likely
this momentum will continue now Obama has secured a second term.

One Running Example

As we proceed through the various component structures and dynamics of CogPrime in the
following chapters, it will be useful to have a few running examples to use to explain how the
various parts of the system are supposed to work. One example we will use fairly frequently is
drawn from the preschool context: the somewhat open-ended task of Build me something
out of blocks, that you haven’t built for me before, and then tell me what it is. This
is a relatively simple task that combines multiple aspects of cognition in a richly interconnected
way, and is the sort of thing that young children will naturally do in a preschool setting.

2.5 Integrative and Synergetic Approaches to Artificial General
Intelligence

In Chapter 1 we characterized CogPrime as an integrative approach. And we suggest that the
naturalness of integrative approaches to AGI follows directly from comparing above lists of
capabilities and criteria to the array of available AI technologies. No single known algorithm
or data structure appears easily capable of carrying out all these functions, so if one wants
to proceed now with creating a general intelligence that is even vaguely humanlike, one must
integrate various AI technologies within some sort of unifying architecture.

For this reason and others, an increasing amount of work in the AI community these days
is integrative in one sense or another. Estimation of Distribution Algorithms integrate proba-
bilistic reasoning with evolutionary learning [Pel05]. Markov Logic Networks [RD06] integrate
formal logic and probabilistic inference, as does the Probabilistic Logic Networks framework
[GIGHO08] utilized in CogPrime and explained further in the book, and other works in the
“Progic” area such as [WW06]. Leslie Pack Kaelbling has synthesized low-level robotics methods
(particle filtering) with logical inference [ZPIX07|. Dozens of further examples could be given.
The construction of practical robotic systems like the Stanley system that won the DARPA
Grand Challenge [Tea06] involve the integration of numerous components based on different
principles. These algorithmic and pragmatic innovations provide ample raw materials for the
construction of integrative cognitive architectures and are part of the reason why childlike AGI
is more approachable now than it was 50 or even 10 years ago.

Further, many of the cognitive architectures described in the current AI literature are “inte-
grative” in the sense of combining multiple, qualitatively different, interoperating algorithms.
Chapter 4 gives a high-level overview of existing cognitive architectures, dividing them into
symbolic, emergentist (e.g. neural network) and Aybrid architectures. The hybrid architectures
generally integrate symbolic and neural components, often with multiple subcomponents within
each of these broad categories. However, we believe that even these excellent architectures are
not integrative enough, in the sense that they lack sufficiently rich and nuanced interactions

Hi Steve, 
I am still intrigued and would like to meet Michael. I thinks it makes sense, though, for us to have a more 
specific conversation about compensation before I meet with him. I don't want to put the cart before the horse, 
but as I mentioned, this would be a big move for me, and it would have to make sense economically in addition 
to being the right move for other reasons we have discussed. 
I hope you are well. Cannot believe that Christie endorsed Trump!

Defense in Depth

In which gates, operated with our new instinct, become at once a tool of prosperity and
survival.

If you walk for a few minutes to the south of Tinanmen Square in Beijing, leaving the
tomb of Mao Zedong behind you, there’s a small lane that runs back into a warren of
anonymous, white-walled buildings. The streets are unusually clean; the
surveillance cameras unusually - even for Beijing - dense. The neighborhood is
home to many of the last of the generation of Communist Party cadres who joined
and supported its rise decades ago. Several years ago, I found myself settled into one
of them for an afternoon tea with Huang Hua, one of the great modern Chinese
foreign policy figures - and a member of that early revolutionary generation. Huang
was, in a sense, heir to the Warring States diplomat Su Qin, whom Master Nan had
encouraged me to study. Huang had penetrated the madness of Mao’s revolutionary
era to see the possibility of a different order, one he’d brought to vivid life after
Deng Xiaoping ascended to the Chinese leadership in 1976. Huang had been the
country’s Foreign Minister and later a Vice Premier. He was always calm, with an
easy and relaxed temperament. One of my favorite images of him was from the mid-
1970s when, while sitting on a flight to the US from Paris to take China’s seat at the
United Nations, he was ambushed by Walter Cronkite. Huang is completely
unflustered in the scratchy video of that encounter. He sits quietly in a cloud of
smoke. Cronkite pesters him. Huang smiles, offers a cigarette to the news crew, and
though he is in the midst of a transit from the poverty, chaos and smashed politics of
China he is nothing but serene, a statesman - not the nervous representative ofa
twitchy power.

“Do you know the difference between Western and Chinese thinking?” Huang asked
that afternoon as we sat inside his courtyard house. Leaves were turning outside. He
was in his early 90s then, still tack-sharp. “You see, when Chinese want to do
something, we begin with the question: What is the nature of the age? Westerners
begin with the goal. What do they aim to achieve?” Deng’s foreign policy, one Huang
shaped and executed, had been an excellent example. Mao, who ruled China from
1949 until 1976, had a darting, paranoid, murderously strategic temperament. The
nature of his age, he was convinced in his Marx-addled mind, was one of zhanzheng
yu geming - war and revolution. From this first principle, everything followed: He
honeycombed Beijing with bomb-proof tunnels, relocated Chinese industry to
isolated and gaspingly poor mountain strongholds, reacted to foreign ideas or
influence with a snapping electricity - and was bent on protective isolation as he
dragged the country through one impossible and failed isolationist development
initiative after another.

Deng, when he came to power in 1977, read the nature of his age too. He read it
differently. “There is no possibility of a great war. Don’t be afraid of it, there is no

risk of it,” he assured a group of Chinese cadres during a chat in 1983. The cadres
were having a hard time replacing their Maoist paranoia with confidence that China

Robinson, 269 F.3d at 141 n. 8.

A. Allegations Against Defendants Asserting
Foreign Sovereign Immunity

1. Saudi High Commission‘

In 1993, then-King Fahad bin Abdulaziz Al—-Saud, the
President of the Council of *548 Ministers of Saudi
Arabia, decreed the formation of SHC, also known as the
Saudi High Relief Commission, by High Order 17419.
(Ashton Compl. J 446; Burnett Compl. J 392; Federal
Compl. § 180; see also SHC Mem. in Sup. Mot. to
Dismiss at 3.) The same High Order named Defendant
Prince Salman the President of SHC. (Ashton Compl. J
446; Burnett Compl. J 392; SHC Mem. in Sup. Mot. to
Dismiss at 3.)

SHC allegedly has contributed $600 million to aid
“Bosnian Muslims impoverished by the country’s recent
civil war.” (Ashton Compl. J 446; Burnett Compl. J 392.)
Plaintiffs claim, however, that SHC does not provide
support to the needy but actually diverts funds for terrorist
activities. (Ashton Compl. 7 454; Burnett Compl. § 404.)
In support, Plaintiffs allege that Prince Salman received a
letter in September 2000 from a Bosnian association
claiming SHC did not provide charitable assistance, and
that none of the money collected after the fall of
Srebrenica in July 1995 actually reached the Srebrenican
people. (Ashton Compl. J§ 454-55; Burnett Com pl. TF
404-05; Federal Compl. JJ 185, 457.) Plaintiffs claim

WESTLAW

SHC’s financial records fail to account for $41 million.
(Ashton Compl. J 456; Burnett Compl. § 407; Federal
Compl. J 460.) SHC allegedly made donations to charity
Defendant Taibah and the bin Laden Establishment.
(Ashton Compl. JJ 376, 462 (relying on 1995 bin Laden
interview); Burnett Compl. J 298.) Plaintiffs also claim
that SHC is responsible for “importing the extreme form
of Saudi Islam, Wahhabism” to Bosnia. (Ashton Compl. J
447; Burnett Compl. § 393.)

The Federal Plaintiffs allege that al Qaeda fighters began
entering Bosnia—Herzegovina in 1992 disguised as SHC
relief workers. (Federal Compl. J 183.) On October 21,
2001, a group of Algerians who were supposedly part of
the al Qaeda network were arrested in Bosnia
Herzegovina on charges of terrorism directed at the
United States embassy. (Ashton Compl. Jf 448-49;
Burnett Compl. J§ 394-95.) One of the arrested, Sabir
Lamar, apparently worked for SHC as an Arabic language
teacher. (Ashton Compl. J 450; Burnett Compl. J 396.)
Also in October 2001, Plaintiffs claim that United States
forces raided the Sarajevo branch of SHC and “found
computer hard drives with photographs of the World
Trade Center before and after its collapse as well as
photos of United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
and the U.S.S. Cole.” (Ashton Compl. J 451; Burnett
Compl. J 397; Federal Compl. J § 186, 458.) The U.S.
forces also apparently found files on pesticides and crop
dusters, the locations of Washington government
buildings, fake State Department badges, and cash.
(Ashton Compl. Ff 451, 453; Burnett Compl. FF 397, 399;
Federal Compl. §§ 186, 459.) After the raid, the Financial
Police of the Federation of Bosnia Herzegovina Ministry
of Finance analyzed the seized documents and stated that
some did “not belong in the scope of work of a
humanitarian organization.” (Federal Compl. Ff 187, 459;
see also Ashton Compl. § 452; Burnett Compl. J 398.)
The Federal Plaintiffs claim that the SHC “has long acted
as a fully integrated component of al Qaida’s logistical
and financial support infrastructure ... [and that the attacks
of September 11 were] a direct, intended and foreseeable
product of [its] participation in al Qaida’s jihadist
campaign.” (Federal Compl. Jf 182, 189.)

*549 2. Prince Salman’
Prince Salman is a member of the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia’s Council of Ministers, the governor of the
province of Riyadh, and the President of Defendant SHC.
(Prince Salman Mem. in Sup. Mot. to Dismiss at 2.)
Plaintiffs allege that Prince Salman provided material
support to Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda. (Ashton

others to obtain minors not only for his own sexual gratification, but also for the sexual gratification of

others.’’

The victims’ attorneys — Edwards, Scarola and Paul Cassell — have asked the Justice Department to throw

out Epstein’s plea agreement and reopen the criminal investigation.

Edwards, who brought the victims’ rights case against the government, said transferring the case to another

jurisdiction is a prudent decision.

“T think it’s good that we’re going to get fresh eyes and a fresh opinion on the way the case was handled,”’
Edwards said Tuesday. “We were obviously in an adversarial posture with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Miami

because they handled the case to begin with.”’

Miami’s new U.S. Attorney, Ariana Fajardo Orshan — who was appointed by President Trump in September

— did not respond to a request for comment.

Edwards predicted that it would take some time for Pak’s office to review the case, which includes more than
500 docket entries and thousands of documents. He said If the sides can’t agree on a resolution, then Marra
would likely have to come up with one. The case is being closely watched by crime victims’ rights advocates,

as it will likely set a precedent.

Acosta, who was appointed by Trump as the U.S. secretary of labor in 2017, is the focus of a separate Justice
Department investigation into whether there was any prosecutorial misconduct in the Epstein case. That probe,
by the DOJ’s Office of Professional Responsibility, was initiated in response to demands from a bipartisan
group in Congress, led by Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman
Schultz of Florida.

In the meantime, a court hearing will be held at 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York in another Epstein-related
case. A federal appeals court will hear oral arguments in a motion by the Miami Herald, supported by 32 other
news organizations, asking the court to unseal documents that could reveal details about the extent of Epstein’s

crimes and any other people who may have been involved.

Three of Epstein’s former attorneys — who helped negotiate his plea deal in 2008 — wrote a letter published

in the New York Times on Monday, defending the plea bargain cut with Acosta as a fair deal. The letter was in

So, we might ask, Where do the 12 cognitive processes get taught
in this MBA program?
First let’s list the cognitive processes again:

Conceptual processes

1. Prediction

2. Judgment

3. Experimentation
4. Evaluation

Analytic processes

1. Diagnosis

3. Causation
4. Judgment

Social processes

1. Influence

2. Teamwork
3. Negotiation
4, Describing

Now let’s consider them one at a time.

Where is prediction taught in our MBA program?

In course 1 (cash crisis), students have to create a financial plan.
Any planning document is a serious attempt at prediction. Prediction
is covered in a different way in course 2. In that course, students need
to predict how users will behave on a website. In course 3, students
need to predict the effects of a marketing campaign and predict what
will work and what will not work in a product launch. In course 4, stu-
dents need to predict how changes they make in the supply chain will
improve the process. In course 5, students are developing a business
model, which is in itself a prediction that certain decisions and behav-
iors will make money. In course 6, students must predict the effects
of various changes in an organization and must predict the behavior
of the people with whom they will negotiate. In course 7, students

e Medicare Part A and Part B unfunded liability improved to -$16 trillion in F2010, up 47% from -$31 trillion in
F2009, per the Board of Medicare Trustees.

e The improvement was driven primarily by downward revisions of future cost growth assumptions following
enactment of healthcare reform in 2010.

e However, Medicare’s Chief Actuary Richard Foster noted that “while the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act, as amended, makes important changes to the Medicare program and substantially improves its
financial outlook, there is a strong likelihood that certain of these changes will not be viable in the
long range...Without major changes in health care delivery systems, the prices paid by Medicare for health
services [as scheduled by current law] are very likely to fall increasingly short of the costs of providing these
services...Congress would have to intervene to prevent the withdrawal of providers from the Medicare
market and the severe problems with beneficiary access to care that would result. Overriding the productivity
adjustments, as Congress has done repeatedly in the case of physician payment rates, would lead to far
higher costs for Medicare in the long range than those projected under current law...For these
reasons, the financial projections shown [here] for Medicare do not represent a reasonable
expectation for actual program operations in either the short range (as a result of the unsustainable
reductions in physician payment rates) or the long range (because of the strong likelihood that the statutory
reductions in price updates for most categories of Medicare provider services will not be viable).”

low-level intelligence could never address the real need for Israel: to ensure we
had early warning if Syria or Lebanon, Jordan or Egypt, were preparing to go to
war against us.

He began toying with the idea of training a small force of Israeli soldiers to
go on cross-border intelligence missions. The initial response from the kirya —
military headquarters in Tel Aviv — was so frustrating that anyone else would
have given up. None of the generals saw any reason to believe his scheme
would work. But the real obstacle was their continuing trauma over what had
happened the last time Israeli soldiers crossed the border on an intelligence
mission. It had happened in 1954, and it ended in a failure even more serious
than Rotem. The target was the Golan Heights, inside Syria. The special
technology unit attached to military intelligence had developed a bugging
device designed to be placed on a telephone pole on the Golan. The task of
installing it was given to the most decorated, and respected, commando unit in
the army: Company A in Sharon’s paratroop battalion, led by its commander,
Meir Har-Zion.

On a spring night in 1954, Har-Zion led his team onto the Golan. They
rigged the bugging unit to the telephone pole, buried the bulky transmitter and
made their way back. And it worked. Israeli intelligence could listen in to
military communications on the Heights. The hitch as that the batteries had to
be replaced every few weeks. Several more times, Meir and his men sneaked
back into Syria to keep the bug working. But as commander of Company A,
Meir was a key part of Israel’s anti-fedayeen operations. The last thing Moshe
Dayan wanted to risk was seeing him captured while trying to replace a few
batteries. So he shifted the task to a regular unit from the Golani Brigade.

In December 1954, a handover mission was organized. Three men from
Company A, including one of Meir’s sergeants, joined three from the Golani
Brigade. But they didn’t even hold a joint exercise before setting off. There was
also a lack of clarity about who was in charge. Though the Golani commander
was nominally the senior officer, only the Company A men had any first-hand
experience of this kind of mission. A half-mile onto the Heights, they were
intercepted by a Syrian soldiers. If this had been a Company A operation, the
response would have been automatic. They would have wheeled, opened fire
and attacked. But when the Syrians ordered the Golanis to drop their weapons,
one of them did, and the Company A men followed suit. They were all taken to
Damascus, held in solitary confinement, beaten and tortured.
