IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014461.txt,"Refining the reflation rotation

2017 is likely to have a number of cross currents as themes. Recovery (we look a
modest acceleration in both growth and inflation) and Rotation go hand in hand. On the
basis of our central forecasts for growth, inflation and rates and given the moves in the
market already we think that the pace of the rotation has to moderate. (In-line with that
we recently downgraded of banks and miners).

Reversal refers to the ECB. Our economists are not yet convinced that the ECB will
start to unwind loose policy 2017 but the probability is increasing. An ECB that tapers
because growth and inflation are improving would be supportive for markets, notably
banks. But tapering because the ability or willingness to do QE fades would likely cause
a setback. Relief or Revolt relates to European politics. Will Europe follow the route to
populism (revolt from the voters) or will we find relief for the markets by the end of
2017 from a Fillon/Merkel duo being in charge of the Euro area’s two largest
economies. We think investors will demand a higher risk premium until the French
Elections in May 2017

Valuation are reasonable at 14x PE but Europe is cheap on a relative basis and the
valuation overhang remains evident in the region’s equity risk premium, which
implies 11% upside to get back to 5-year average levels. We see a return to positive
EPS growth (+7%) in Europe for the first time since 2014, as 3.5% global GDP growth
should deliver positive earnings growth (supported by Resources recovery, capex
discipline and FX. +7% growth implies less downgrades than usual (10% is the average).

Bond yields and equities — stable/higher inflation breakevens are key. Equities can
continue to perform in an environment of higher rates — the key is that inflation
breakevens are not falling. However, a more aggressive bond sell-off taking Treasury
yields to 3% or higher would undermine EM, the growth outlook and risky assets.

The rotation out of bond proxies and Defensives into Financials and Cyclicals has
moved to extreme levels: relative performance of Financials / Cyclicals versus
Defensives rose over 6SD in 10-14 months. Technical metrics are at historical extremes,
arguing for a moderation in relative returns and a more balanced approach to sector
allocation is justified right now. Look for another leg to cyclical trades in the New Year.

Sectors have also moved a long way already from a valuation perspective.
Financials are now trading around median relative valuation levels. Healthcare PE
relative is at the bottom of the historical range and Utilities relative PE is also close to
the prior low hit in 2013. Food & Beverage still commands a large premium and PE-
relative is 6-10% above the 2010 / 2014 lows.

We remain cautious on domestic UK exposure. The full impact of sterling weakness
on the UK consumer environment is yet to be felt and Brexit negotiations are likely to
drive further uncertainty and FX volatility in our view. Structural issues add to our
concerns in Retail and Travel & Leisure (both underweight).

Overweight Oil, Healthcare, Utilities, Media; underweight Food & Beverage. If OPEC
cuts production and oil recovers up to the high $50s per barrel, Oil sector EPS and cash
flows can recover significantly and make the highest DY in market (6%) look sustainable.
Healthcare we believe is too cheap relative to an improving sector growth outlook. 2017
will be an important year for newsflow on key pipeline drugs. Evidence of success can
drive a re-rating independent of macro. Despite the recent sell-off, among defensives
and bond proxies Food & Beverage still seems the least attractive. Valuations are among
the most expensive in the market and overweight positioning has not corrected
materially yet. We move overweight Media, a wuality cyclical that has lagged badly and
seen valuations de-rate.

Dear Professor Krauss, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031027 
We met briefly after your talk in Ithaca a few months ago — I'm the girl on The Skeptics' Guide to the 
Universe podcast. I've really enjoyed your talks and books, but I was surprised to see you quoted in the 
Daily Beast recently defending Jeffrey Epstein: 
http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2011-04-01/bill-clinton-katie-couric-woody-allen-jeffrey-
epsteins-society-friends-close-ranks/2/  
Can you confirm if the following quote is accurate? 
If anything, the unfortunate period he suffered has caused him to really think about what he wants to do 
with his money and his time, and support knowledge, says Krauss. Jeffrey has surrounded himself with 
beautiful women and young women but they're not as young as the ones that were claimed. As a scientist I 
always judge things on empirical evidence and he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've 
never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were I would 
believe him over other people. Though colleagues have criticized him over his relationship with Epstein, 
Krauss insists, I don't feel tarnished in any way by my relationship with Jeffrey; I feel raised by it. 
Thanks,

On Mon, Jan 11, 2010 at 6:32 PM, Peggy Siegal <)________________________k wrote: 
Wrote this for the February issue of AVENUE Magazine. Thought it would amuse you. Tell me what you 
think of it. 
xoxo Peggy 
HD: Wall Street, Take Two 
DEK: In the upcoming sequel to Oliver Stone's groundbreaking film, Gordon Gekko gets out of jail and back 
to business. Peggy Siegal takes us behind the scenes where she got herself on camera along with a few of her 
famous friends. Nice work if you can get it. 
In 1987, right after director Oliver Stone won the Academy Award for Platoon, he immediately turned to a 
domestic arena and began working on Wall Street in New York City where his father had been a 
stockbroker. Although the film was widely seen as a scathing critique of the culture of Wall Street, Stone has 
said that part of the film is a defense of capitalism, his father's vision of finance (as seen through the Hal 
Holbrook character) and an homage to his father. 
At the time Oliver was also fascinated with the connection between the psyche of Latino Miami drug dealers 
from his earlier Scarface script and the American-born 28- to 35-year-old, white collar stockbrokers. Both 
groups had an animalistic need to obtain big and fast money. They shared an obsession with corruption and 
greed. 
Oliver sent his actors to Bear Stearns for research, including then-newcomer Charlie Sheen, who played Bud 
Fox, a kid from nowhere. When he learns to cold call, and lands one big client, Gordon Gekko, Fox is thrust 
into the fast lane with a rock star financial mentor who teaches him corruption. 
Oliver needed an old-fashioned villain to create drama, and he cast Michael Douglas as Gekko against type. 
Michael was not known as a heavy at the time, but as a charming, handsome, sensitive leading man. Oliver 
also saw the anger, confidence, salesmanship and style that Michael brought to the role. Michael's Gekko 
looked a bit like Laker's coach Pat Riley with his slicked back hair and well-cut suits, and it became Michael's 
most important role, winning him the Academy Award for the villain no one could ever forget. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021235 
When Gekko delivers his speech, Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right. Greed works, 
cinematic history was made. 
Wall Street was set in 1985, a time before ten financial news networks broadcasting 24/7 existed. The entire 
financial services industry was largely unknown and Oliver Stone nailed it. 
Four years ago, Wall Street's producer Ed Pressman decided it was time for a sequel and met with Fox Film 
Entertainment co-chairmen Tom Rothman and Jim Gianopulos. Michael Douglas was immediately on-board 
pending script approval. Steven Schiff wrote the first script before the global economic crash of 2008 rendered 
it obsolete. 
Alan Loeb was brought in for a rewrite. Pressman asked me to meet Loeb at the Carlyle Hotel to explain the 
social rhythms of New York's financial high society. Whereas Gekko's character was modeled after '70s junk 
bond kings (Michael Milken) and '80s mergers and acquisitions killers (Henry Kravis), Loeb bases the new 
villain on hedge fund billionaires like John Paulson and Mike Novogratz, geniuses who have created 
stratospheric wealth beyond Gordon Gekko's wildest dreams. When Oliver Stone agreed to direct, he rewrote a 
portion of the script to focus on bankers as well as hedge funders, taking no screen credit. 
This past September, Oliver yelled, action as Gordon Gekko, with long grey hair, comes back to life as he 
emerges from a lengthy prison stint shot outside of Sing Sing in Ossining, New York. Gekko is desperate to 
redefine himself in a different era. The New York Post runs a full-page photo of Gekko and New Yorkers 
immediately become obsessed with the filming of Wall Street 2. 
A week into shooting, a glorious fall day. Ed Pressman invites me on the set at the Central Park Zoo. Oliver 
designs an elaborate tracking shot around the seal pool where Gekko, fresh from jail, walks and talks to Jake 
Moore, a young idealistic investment banker played by Shia LaBoeuf. They discuss Gekko's daughter Winnie, 
Moore's fiancée, played by Carrie Mulligan, who is also having an off-screen romance with LaBoeuf. Oliver 
played Cupid. Moore invites Gekko to the Alzheimer's Ball at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Gekko, who 
used to be a sponsor or honoree of such events, cannot even afford a ticket. 
The shot starts with a barking seal jumping for fish, then pans down to the actors. Extras weave in and out. In 
one take Michael makes a wrong turn and ends up at the monkey house. Everyone laughs. The atmosphere on 
the set is courteous but quick and tense. There is pressure when you are making a sequel to a hit. 
I watch the action on monitors while sitting on the producers' canvas chairs with Pressman, Eric Kopeloff 
(Monsters Ball) and Celia Costas, who was a location manager on the first Wall Street. They have asked 
me to be an extra in the Alzheimer's Ball scene and bring some friends to play rich Upper East Side socialites. 
Oliver wants over the top glam, go-to-the-vault jewels and couture gowns. Give me the night before the 
Titanic goes down, were his exact words. Not a problem. 
I pay a quick visit to Michael in his trailer on Fifth Avenue where he is resting. We go way back. I was his 
personal publicist when he won the Golden Globe and Oscar for Best Actor for Wall Street and we have 
remained great friends. Gekko is just as challenging for him the second time because of endless pages of 
technical financial dialogue. We discuss Catherine Zeta-Jones' Broadway debut in a Little Night Music. 
Michael has a stack of partially finished handwritten thank you notes next to him for gifts received for 
their shared birthday party on September 25th at the St. Regis. Her 40th and his 65th. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021236 
I tell him I have been cast as an extra in two scenes and he laughs knowing I am desperate to hang around him 
and the production. 
8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, October 21st, another warm, stunning fall day. I report to the wardrobe trailer on 
65th Street and Madison Avenue. I carry four elaborate cocktail dresses and bags of matching accessories. My 
hair is in rollers. Statuesque Julia Koch walks over from her Park Avenue apartment carrying her white 
Valentino and long diamond earrings. Her real-life financial titan husband David is unaware where she is this 
morning. 
Vanity Fair's keeper of the Best Dressed List, Amy Fine Collins, arrives totally organized in turquoise vintage 
Geoffrey Beene, and Vogue's fashion editor Hamish Bowles wears a riot of plaids, patterns and a large yellow 
fake flower on his lapel. Costume Designer Ellen Mirojnick, who created Gordon Gekko's rich slick look in the 
first film, is ecstatic with the extras I invited. 
Oliver is shooting a scene with Josh Brolin (the star of Stone's W). His character Bretton (never Bret) 
James, a ruthless Wall Street kingpin, and his perfect wife Samantha (Noelle Beck) are hosting a benefit piano 
recital for a 13-year-old child prodigy in their huge, art-filled townhouse at 41 East 65th Street. The building 
actually belongs to Baby Jane Holzer, a wealthy art collector still famous for hanging with Andy Warhol in the 
'60s. The production designer had Jane's fabulous Warhols moved to storage and replaced with matching 
photographic copies. Very expensive contemporary art is again an important production element of Oliver's 
vision. 
At 10:30 a.m., all the extras are placed around the living room set. Oliver's French mother, Jacqueline Stone, 
and her friend Monique Van Vooren, both in their 80s, are seated in front of the fireplace chatting in French. 
Production assistants fuss over them. Debonair macho man Chuck Pfieffer, who appeared in the original film, 
and I immediately invent a back story—I am his corporate wife—and we position ourselves on a couch next to 
the director's mother. Julia gets the best spot close to the piano and Amy, Hamish and decorator Geoffrey 
Bradfield are right behind her. Josh is brought in and the kibitzing stops. 
Oliver appears on the set with eagle eyes and a sly grin and quickly re-positions everyone. He explains the 
scene, gives out lines to his favored extras, and on his way out to the monitors in the next room mentions that 
my earrings are too small. Wardrobe jumps. Josh rehearses and Oliver finally yells, Action. The kid plays 
the piano, Josh explains why we are in his home, asks for money, the camera dollies as extras say their lines 
and Shia appears at the door uninvited for a confrontation with Josh. Three hours later a PA yells, Lunch. 
In costume, Amy, Hamish and I run to The Monkey Bar. I am late to meet The Harpies, including Liz 
Smith, Barbara Walters, Cynthia McFadden, Nora Ephron, Jennifer Isham, Maury Perl and Beth Kseniak. 
Graydon Carter is at the next table. I tell him Oliver Stone wants him in Wall Street 2 as an extra. (I make 
this up.) Graydon jokes that he only works with lines. I say, Not a problem. (This will be news to Oliver.) 
Back on the set I tell Oliver that Graydon is willing to be in the film with lines. Oliver finds that intriguing. 
Oliver shoots the piano recital scene over and over again from different angles all afternoon. Financial wizard 
Don Marron saunters on the set to visit and Oliver spontaneously puts him in a scene chatting with Josh. Carrie 
Mulligan hangs out watching boyfriend Shia work. 
At sundown Julia Koch has to race from reel to real life and explain to her husband where she has been all day. 
(He loves it.)

Oliver shoots a crowded tight interior scene with Michael, Carrie and Shia, who are having an intimate 
Chinese dinner. Spontaneously, Oliver decides this is the perfect scene for Graydon Carter. After a flurry of 
calls, Graydon arrives on set, and playing himself, sashays by the table. Gekko jumps up to say hello and 
Graydon brushes him off with a few dismissive lines. 
Monday, November 9, 25 Broadway 
One hundred swells show up at the former Canard Shipping building, a massive Italianate hall, at the crack of 
dawn for the Alzheimer's Ball, a grand charity event. 
Susan Hess and I are chauffeured downtown with our Vera Wang gowns and report to the VIP extra holding 
area where we join Prince Dimitri of Yugoslavia in a bespoke dinner jacket, journalist Christopher Mason, 
songstress Yanna Avis, photographer Kelly Klein, art dealer Larry Gagosian's girl friend Shala Monroque in 
see-through Rodarte, beauty executive Olivia Chantecaille, producer Lawrence Robins, author Jackie Weld 
Drake, Vogue film critic Joan Juliet Buck, fashion consultant Jill Fairchild, CNN's Felicia Taylor and Italian 
newsman Mario Calvo-Platero. 
Ellen Mirojnick and her costume department have assembled racks of the most expensive elaborate designer 
gowns and work at break neck speed styling while we wildly strip to our undies in a makeshift dressing area. 
Ellen pours me into a black tulle Marchesa with a enormous wired silver bow. Twenty hairdressers and make-
up artists systematically work on 250 extras. A mile of tables are alternately filled with steaming coffee, 
fattening breakfast foods, hair sprays, mirrors, shoes and jewelry. It's a madhouse of excitement. 
We are led to the part of the set used for the cocktail reception and placed around Michael Douglas and Charlie 
Sheen stand-ins. Charlie has been flown in from LA for half a day's work to reprise his original character. He 
is now the highest paid television actor commanding two million dollars an episode of Two and a Half Men. 
Oliver arrives on the set greeting, examining, tweaking the shot and always pulling the prettiest girls closest to 
the camera. Michael and Charlie arrive from their trailers and run their lines as socials drift into their sight 
lines challenging their concentration on pages of dialogue. Oliver yells, Action as the extras aggressively 
jockey for face time. Charlie is not having an easy day and they do take after take. My corporate husband 
Chuck Pfieffer has gotten his real girlfriend Lisa Crosby in the film and my marriage has become a threesome. 
Sensing our concern of not making it onto the silver screen Oliver tells his first assistant director to seat a 
dinner table with Susan Hess, Jill Fairchild, Prince Dimitri, Chuck Pfieffer, Grace Meigher and Mario Calvo-
Platero. He directs us to chat with each other turning left and right as the camera closely pans past our faces. 
Elsewhere on the set are John Buffalo Mailer, as Shia's character's best friend, Austin Pendleton, 94-year-old 
Eli Wallach and Natalie Morales. Also in this film are: the magnificent Frank Langella, as Shia's boss, who 
throws himself in front of a train early in the film, Susan Sarandon as Shia's real-estate broker mother, Sylvia 
Miles, who reprises her hilarious cameo as another real-estate agent and Jean Pigozzi as an international 
banker. 
Lunch is called at 4 p.m. and Michael Douglas takes seven heavily made-up and bejeweled women including 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021238 
Susan, Jill and me to a restaurant around the corner. Gordon Gekko hosts a hen party talking about children, 
schools, country houses and vacations. 
Back on the set Oliver is shooting the actual dinner. Assistant directors ask for volunteers to dance to the live 
music. Prince Dimitri twirls and dips Jackie Weld. Kelly Klein, in her own Karl Lagerfeld sheer black organza, 
watches from a table with scattered champagne glasses half-filled with apple juice along with her 86-year-old 
father, Tulley Rector. Charlie Sheen leaves for LA and Shia is very annoyed he was not introduced to his 
hero. Carrie Mulligan, costumed like Audrey Hepburn, chats with us between takes. 
The final set up is a long tracking shot of Josh Brolin and his wife as they triumphantly enter the ball. It is 
close to 9 p.m. and Lord William Astor arrives to pick me up for Amalia Dayan and Adam Lindemann's dinner 
for artists uptown. 
Oliver is introduced to William and delights in calling him Lord as he immediately moves him into the top of 
the shot and instructs him to tell Eli Wallach, We must do lunch. Ever the proper English gentleman, 
William advises Oliver that Lords do not use American slang and improvises his own lines. The tracking shot 
continues for numerous takes following Josh and NoeIle as every VIP extra gets another shot at instant stardom 
with one-line greetings. 
At last, It's a wrap is screamed after 10 p.m. Prince Dimitri tells The Wall Street Journal it was, a day of 
electrifying glamour, and the longest gala of my life. I was in black tie for thirteen hours. 
November 25, Tommy Gun Salon, Ludlow Street, last day of shooting 
Donald Trump is on set at 7 a.m. ready for his close up. He is trying to make a mid-day departure on his jet 
from Teterboro with wife Melania and son Baron for Thanksgiving weekend in Palm Beach. Back in 
September, Oliver had invited Donald Trump to dinner at 21 to meet his leading men Josh and Shia so they 
could observe New York's most charismatic powerbroker in his natural environment. 
The scene is London so the grey skies are perfect. Gekko has moved abroad to make his financial 
comeback. The scene opens on the back of his head in a barber's chair as he watches the financial news on TV. 
The camera pulls back and Gordon Gekko is finally revealed as the powerful bull he once was in an exquisite 
suit and signature slicked-back hair. Donald Trump walks into the shop for a cut and the banter begins about 
the money market. From his chair, Donald leans into Michael and suggests a comb over like his famous 
do. Gekko, with a slight grin, says, No thanks Donald, I am a gel man. 
The crew is yucking it up and Donald feels great. Paparazzi shoot the whole scene with long lenses from across 
the street. The unit publicist is helpless to keep this under wraps. Donald emerges, poses and gives interviews. 
Michael comes out, and the press think they have a scoop on the ending. Gekko is back in all his lovable titan 
splendor. Full-page photos of Michael and Donald run the next day in the tabloids. Never underestimate Oliver 
Stone's surprise endings. 
Twentieth Century Fox releases Wall Street 2: The Money Never Sleeps on April 23rd and it's got hit written 
all over it.

BRIDGE

BRIDGE is an infrastructure debt platform initiated by Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management (EdRAM) to
enable institutional investors to access infrastructure assets with secured and stable revenue streams. BRIDGE
is a London based second generation debt fund sourcing and structuring transactions directly from sponsors
when feasible and one of the few independent debt teams only investing on behalf of clients. The BRIDGE team
has the ability to execute and deliver transactions as efficiently as traditional lenders as well as negotiate terms
and conditions bringing optimised yield and security to investors.

The BRIDGE platform was set up as a new leg of EDR’s Infrastructure, Real Assets & Structured Finance Team
striving to take advantage of the expertise of the infrastructure sector acquired when the team became a global
leader in PPP & Transport infrastructure financial advisory in 2011 and 2012.

The BRIDGE platform raised € 400m of new monies in 2016 and has successfully reached the €1bn mark of
Assets under Management at the end of 2016. The platform comprises three investment vehicles (French FCT
and Lux SIF) and is currently fundraising for additional pockets of liquidity:

o BRIDGE I reached final closing in December 2014 with approximately €600m of aggregate commitments from a club

of institutional investors.

o BRIDGE | Dedicated Compartmentis a vehicle created by a large European institution and anchor investor of the first
fund with a €250m target amount available for deployment.

o BRIDGE II reached first close in December 2016 with €150m of commitments in order to invest in three transactions.
Fundraising for BRIDGE II is still ongoing, targeting a group of institutional investors in Europe and elsewhere, with final
target size of €600m.

The BRIDGE platform has a long-term European investment strategy and a mandate to cover all sectors of
infrastructure, notably energy, renewables, utilities, transportation, telecommunications and_ social

infrastructure and can execute project financing, refinancing and acquisition finance transactions.

I've contact universal ref Cuba trip: 
Attached is current form they are utilizing,. 
See note from UVAir below: 
Hello Larry, 
This year we have had quite a few successful Cuba trips with clients over the past year or so that Cuba 
travel has resumed. Attached are the rules and regulations that we currently operate under. 
Keep in mind on 16 Jun 2017, President Donald Trump has announced changes that are to come regarding 
Cuban and us relations. This means the regulations are being rewritten to reflect these changes and are 
to be published 30-90 days from that date. We do not have advance notice on how the regulations will be 
written or exactly how it will affect our Cuba licensing but we are sure they will have some impact on 
us 
Until further notice we are still utilizing the attached information. I will keep an eye out for updates 
on Cuba restrictions; however, we should start the process as we have in the past. 
We will need the following documents form you: 
1. In the attached document on page number 10 there is a cubia BIS Certification Form we will need this 
filled out by the PIC for the trip. This is a self-authorization form for the aircraft and should be kept 
on file after the trip in case the Department of Treasury asks for it in the future. 
2. We will also need the Passenger certification form for each passenger on board. They will need to 
advise purpose of travel under section 1. If they do not fall under any of those then they will need a 
specific license from the Department of Treasury. 
After we receive the above documents for the aircraft and passengers we can start arranging handing and 
landing permits for the trip.

2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *856

recite a specific proposed change followed by the rationale for that change as both a matter of law and of policy. For
convenience, this Article discusses the proposed changes sequentially, beginning with Rule 1.

Rule 1 - Definition of Victim
The Proposal:
Rule 1 should be amended to include the following definition of a victim:

Victim means a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a federal offense or an offense in the
District of Columbia. In the case of a crime victim who is under 18 years of age, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the
legal guardians of the crime victim or the representatives of the crime victim's estate, family members, or any other persons
appointed as [*857] suitable by the court, may assume the crime victim's rights under these rules, but in no event shall the
defendant be named as such guardian or representative.

The Rationale:

The CVRA directly defines victim using this language, !2° which ought to be folded into the rules for convenience. The
rules currently define such terms as attorney for the government, federal judge, and petty offense. !*! Victim should
likewise be defined.

A definition is required for a second reason: Rule 32 currently contains a differing definition of victim as an individual
against whom the defendant committed an offense for which the court will impose sentence. !2? Because that definition varies
from that mandated by the CVRA, it must be changed. Furthermore, the CVRA's definition comes with an interpretative
history. '?? The CVRA's definition of victim is taken almost verbatim from the 1996 Mandatory Victims Restitution Act
(MVRA). !?4 In tum, the MVRA drew on the 1982 Victim Witness Protection Act (VWPA). !?> As a result, the CVRA uses a
definition of victim that is more than twenty-two years old and that has not produced major administrative or definitional

problems. Courts will be able to draw from that history to determine who qualifies as a victim. 17°

21 See Fed. R. Crim. P. 1(b)(1), 1(b)(3), 1(b)(8).

22 Td. at 32(a)(2).

legislation).

4 See 18 U.S.C. 3663A(a)(2). For differences from the old law, see Twist, supra note 2.

25 See 18 U.S.C. 3663(a)(2).

26 See, e.g., Hughey v. United States, 495 U.S. 411 (1990) (holding that VWPA limited victim to victims of the actual offense of
conviction so that district court could not order restitution on basis of charges that were dropped as part of plea agreement); United States v.
Follet, 269 F.3d 996 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that a free clinic was not a victim of the defendant's rape of his niece); Moore v. United
States, 178 F.3d 994 (Sth Cir. 1999) (holding that a bank customer was victim of attempted bank robbery under MVRA where defendant
pointed a sawed-off shotgun at the customer and the teller, who were standing only two feet apart, while demanding money), cert. denied,
528 U.S. 943 (1999); United States v. Sanga, 967 F.2d 1332 (9th Cir. 1992) (holding that foreign national who conspired to be brought into
United States illegally was still a victim of the conspiracy where her smuggler threatened her life and forced her to work as live-in maid
once she had arrived); United States v. Bedonie, 317 F. Supp. 2d 1285 (D. Utah 2004) (holding that victim in manslaughter case under
MVRA was murdered person himself and not the estate), rev'd on other grounds, United States v. Serawop, 410 F.3d 656 (10th Cir. 2005).
See generally John F. Wagner, Jr., Annotation, Who Is a Victim, So as To Be Entitled to Restitution Under Victim and Witness Protection
Act, 108 A.L.R. Fed. 828 (2005).

A few new issues will need to be litigated. For example, the Hughey case noted above conflicts with the views of Senator Jon Kyl, co-
sponsor of the CVRA, who explained that the definition of victim in the CVRA is an intentionally broad definition because all victims of

NORTH AMERICA INSIGHT ~~

Deconstructing Our Implied Carry Valuation:
What Is the Market Paying?

We deconstruct the various pieces of a SOTP for the alts
in order to determine our best guess on how much the
market is valuing future performance fees. We then
divide that implied value by future performance fee earn-
ings, to determine the implied multiple that the market is
paying for this earings stream. This is the groundwork for
our upside and downside scenarios if the alts were to
convert to C-corps.

We simplify our the SOTP and standardize it across the group to
look at &4 main components. 1) after-tax core fee-related earnings,
2) balance sheet value of investments plus net cash/debt, 3) net
accrued carry balance, and &) future value of performance fees. The
values of the balance sheet and net accrued carry receivable are
static items with balances as of 3Q17. We then adjust the multiple on
our core FRE to determine a value for what we believe the street is
using. To be conservative, we use 15x as a starting point for what we
believe is currently priced in. We then take the current share price
and subtract out the value of the FRE, net accrued carry performance
fees and the balance sheet and we are left with an implied value of
what the marketis pricing in for future carry. Once we have the future
carry value, we divide by the net performance fee earnings per share
for each company and get an implied multiple on the future perform-
ance fees. Using this approach and a 15x multiple on FRE, we see the

market is valuing future performance fees at 7.5x on average anda

We make several key adjustments in the SOTP valuations: First,
we use our own Morgan Stanley definition of core fee-related earn-
ings in our calculation. We use our core approach as we attempt to
normalize the various definitions of FRE across the companies. The
main difference vs. company-reported FRE is that we fully burden all
expenses, including equity-based compensation. KKR differs the
most on company-reported vs. MS Core FRE. For more information

on our core FRE methodology, please see our note Alternative Asset

Managers: Who@Got Swimsuits? (19 May 2016).

We also make adjustments for ARES an OAK. For Ares: a signifi-
cant portion of the fee related earnings come from Part 1 BDC fees.
These are investment income sharing fees from their management
agreement with ARCC. In the MS approach, we value these sepa-
rately from more traditional management fees. However, we do not
believe that the market looks at the fees this way, and so we include
them in the total FRE by using the same multiple as we are using for
FRE (15x). For presentation purposes in the table below, we break out
the BDC Part 1 fees separately for ARES to show the value. OAK: We
adjust the balance of OAK@investments on balance sheet to account
for OAK© 20% ownership stake in DoubleLine which it currently
holds at cost of $21m as adjusted under the equity method of
accounting. With the benefit of lower corporate taxes we currently
value OAK@ownership stake at $1B. We do not believe the market

gives full value for this 20% ownership and haircut our MSe value by

median 6.5x. 50% to $500m. We then add this value to the balance of investments
and net cash for OAK@total balance sheet value.

new ways to transmit video. Application developers create fresh tools to compress
their signals. The whole system gets faster. Such co-evolution is common when
linked systems press into one another.?5!

If you look back at biological history, at our planet’s seething life at it’s most
profound moments of transition, you find co-evolution in nearly every case. The
biologists John Maynard Smith and Eors Szathmary, in their masterwork The Major
Transitions in Evolution, chronicle the miraculous march of life towards ever-greater
complexity — from cells to humans to societies - as a story of ceaseless, successful
co-evolution. “Complexity is hard to define or to measure,” they write. “But there is
surely some sense in which elephants and oak trees are more complex than bacteria,
and bacteria than the first replicating molecules.” The essential, facilitating feature
of our biological hop-scotch from mitochondrial snot to Beethoven sonatas has been
an ability to change together, not merely to compete. While we humans tend to
consider evolution in murderous you win/I lose Darwinian terms, the biological
world around us seethes with a more nuanced logic: Cooperation is every bit as
important to survival.

Smith and Szathmary identified eight major transitions in their work - the evolution
from single cell to multiple cell organisms, for instance. And in each case they find a
kind of cooperative, co-evolving logic serving a catalyst to survival. “The
applicability of the concept,” Smith and Szathmary conclude, “extends across the
whole of social and natural sciences.” Inside cells. In ecosystem webs of coral or
rainforest. In traffic management. Successful evolution was, they found, always co-
evolution. “It should need little persuasion to acknowledge that links we make with
others change in time,” they wrote. “That all of us age, that our roles in life evolve,
and that the society we are a part of may itself be subject to transformations ona
global scale. Coevolutionary rules aim to integrate these processes.” The world
changes. I change. You change.

Network age systems, in their effortless bridging of divisions - geographical,
technical, commercial - bounce with a particularly powerful fusion. “It is often
assumed that biological agents are by nature rationally selfish, and that therefore
external circumstances somehow have to compel them to cooperate,” the historians
Nathale Mezza-Garcia, Tom Froese and Nelson Fernadez have written about the
organization of societies over the past millennia. That sense we often have, that
we're one Darwinian instant from some sort of lethal, teeth-baring competition,
doesn’t in fact explain all of human history. 253 Politics is a sort of complex adaptive

Occupiers have broadened public awareness about the economic injustice
perpetuated by corporations without compassion conspiring with
government corruption that has resulted in immeasurable suffering. The
Yippies were a myth that became a reality. The Occupiers are a reality that

NPR waited until eleven days of Occupy Wall Street had passed

Occupiers “did not involve large numbers of people” (actually, there

¢ The region continued to show high volatility last month, with its P/BV temporarily close to 2008 lows.
¢ Hong Kong and Singapore markets’ domestic fundamentals remain solid. Hong Kong should benefit
from China's gradual recovery in 2H 2012, while Singapore's economy is rebounding and corporate
balance sheets and earnings remain solid. After the rate cut early June, we expect China to have more
policies to support growth in 2H 2012. China is our most preferred market, while Indonesia is least
preferred in the region. We are more concerned about Indonesia's fiscal deficit, since the fuel price hike
did not happen. Domestic problems for Indonesia include current account deficits, potential capital
outflows, bottomed-out inflation and hiccups in economic and market reforms, in our view.
¢ We expect 10% earnings-per-share growth over 12 months for the MSCI Asia ex-Japan, which trades on
11.6x 12-month trailing earnings. We expect this multiple to expand slightly in the next six months, as the
current earnings downgrade cycle is approaching its end. Nevertheless, MSCI Asia ex-Japan is likely to see
further volatility in the near term due to global macro risk factors.

improved global growth outlook should lead to a better earnings outlook. We would expect earnings
growth of 15% and a P/E based on realized earnings of 14x.

4 Negative scenario MSCI APAC ex-Japan (6-month target): 380
e Ahard landing in China with a global recession leads to negative earnings revisions for 2012. In this

scenario, earnings could fall 20% over 12 months and the P/E could fall to about 10.5x.
Note: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)

What we're watching Why it matters

Growth Both HK and Singapore's GDP growth disappointed, raising concerns about the
growth momentum in the region. Investors should focus on whether growth
will re-accelerate in the near term. Key dates: 3 July, HK retail sales; 13

July, SG retail sales; 17 July, SG exports

Policy responses Some other countries in the region have structural issues due to fuel subsidies
(e.g. Indonesia) and fiscal deficits (e.g. India). Policy responses often come on an

ad hoc base.

Recommendations

Tactical (6 months)

e We prefer Hong Kong banks, Singapore
high-dividend stocks and Chinese
insurance and consumer plays.

e We are concerned about India's inflation
pressure, but we see opportunities in the
power and banking sectors.

Strategic (1 to 2 years)

e Rising consumption is the long-term trend
in Asia ex-Japan that we expect will
continue to play out.

e In China, sectors that contribute to
improved labor productivity or deliver
goods and services for the elderly should
benefit from demographic changes
(ageing population and decelerating
population growth).

ing third-party agents or intermediaries. The fact that a
bribe is paid by a third party does not eliminate the poten-
tial for criminal or civil FCPA liability.?!

For instance, a four-company joint venture used
two agents—a British lawyer and a Japanese trading
company—to bribe Nigerian government officials in
order to win a series of liquefied natural gas construc-
tion projects.” Together, the four multi-national cor-
porations and the Japanese trading company paid a
combined $1.7 billion in civil and criminal sanctions
for their decade-long bribery scheme. In addition, the
subsidiary of one of the companies pleaded guilty and a
number of individuals, including the British lawyer and
the former CEO of one of the companies’ subsidiaries,
received significant prison terms.

Similarly, a medical device manufacturer entered into
a deferred prosecution agreement as the result of corrupt
payments it authorized its local Chinese distributor to pay
to Chinese officials.’ Another company, a manufacturer
of specialty chemicals, committed multiple FCPA viola-
tions through its agents in Iraq: a Canadian national and
the Canadian’s companies. Among other acts, the Canadian
national paid and promised to pay more than $1.5 million
in bribes to officials of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil to secure
sales ofa fuel additive. Both the company and the Canadian
national pleaded guilty to criminal charges and. resolved
civil enforcement actions by SEC.

In another case, the US. subsidiary of a Swiss freight
forwarding company was charged with paying bribes on
behalf of its customers in several countries.' Although the
US. subsidiary was not an issuer under the FCPA, it was an
“agent” of several USS. issuers and was thus charged directly
with violating the FCPA. Charges against the freight for-
warding company and seven of its customers resulted in
over $236.5 million in sanctions.!**

Because Congress anticipated the use of third-party
agents in bribery schemes—for example, to avoid actual
knowledge of a bribe—it defined the term “knowing” in a
way that prevents individuals and businesses from avoiding

liability by putting “any person” between themselves and

The FCPA:

the foreign officials.'®” Under the FCPA, a person’s state of
mind is “knowing” with respect to conduct, a circumstance,
ora result if the person:
* is aware that [he] is engaging in such conduct,
that such circumstance exists, or that such result is
substantially certain to occur; or
e hasa firm belief that such circumstance exists or
that such result is substantially certain to occur.’
Thus, a person has the requisite knowledge when he is
aware of a high probability of the existence of such circum-
stance, unless the person actually believes that such circum-
stance does not exist.” As Congress made clear, it meant to
impose liability not only on those with actual knowledge
of wrongdoing, but also on those who purposefully avoid

actual knowledge:

[T]he so-called “head-in-the-sand” problem—vari-

ously described in the pertinent authorities as “con-

scious disregard,” “willful blindness” or “deliberate

ignorance”—should be covered so that management
officials could not take refuge from the Act’s prohi-
bitions by their unwarranted obliviousness to any
action (or inaction), language or other “signaling de-

vice” that should reasonably alert them of the “high

probability” of an FCPA violation.!°
Common red flags associated with third parties include:

® excessive commissions to third-party agents or
consultants;

e unreasonably large discounts to third-party
distributors;

e third-party “consulting agreements” that include
only vaguely described services;

The newspapers and Browardbeat.com make clear that the Federal investigations that led to the arrests
of County Commissioner Josephus Eggleston, former Miramar Commissioner Fitzroy Salesman and
School Board member Bev Gallagher are just beginning. ©

The FBI will be interviewing everyone from County Administrator Bertha Henry to bus drivers about
anything and everything.

They are looking for scalps.

I suspect that if the average person thought about it, he would assume that when the FBI comes calling,
_ Tike Joe Friday from DRAGNET, they want the facts and nothing but the facts. Equally important
they want an accurate record of that interview so they bring a court reporter or at the very leastatape
recorder.

The average person would be wrong,

Agents bring a pencil and pad to take notes. They then prepare a summary of the interview called a
m3Q2 Report. :

_ If you are called as a witness at trial, prior to testifying, you will be given a copy of Your 302 to
review. It is a record of what the FBI insists you said at your previous meeting.

If your interview lasted more than thirty seconds, it is guaranteed you will find numerous discrepancies.
Some of them will be insigalioaat, some of them could be material.

“Ask two people to listen to you in a discussion about a traffic accident and then write a summary. Iti isa
guaranteed they will have differences with each other as well as with you, the witness.

tHtt

You said, I am reasonably sure that the traffic light was green

One report takes out the equivocation and quotes you as saying: The light w was green.

This brings us to Federal law 18 USC 1001. That statute makes it a felony to lie to the poveruaicat. And
guess who decides whether or not you were lying? The government. —

So here is your conundrum. Do you testify about your doubts about the light, which is the truth, or do
you adopt the 302 version to avoid the wrath of the FBI?

Whether or not the 302' discrepancies are a result of stupidity or cupidity makes no difference.
Testify in opposition to the 302 and you are in the crosshairs of the Feds.

If they believe your testimony cost them the case, the next thing you likely to hear from the FBI will be:
Please place your hands behind your back.

Cannabis Investment Report | December 2017

Production Outlook

Due to U.S. federal and international legal restrictions on cannabis commerce, producers currently
must invest significant capital in potentially redundant facilities located in separate jurisdictions, and
many large agricultural producers and equipment suppliers that could effectively compete in the can-
nabis industry are reluctant to enter the market. In the near term, we expect that cultivators will con-
tinue to raise capital for facilities across multiple jurisdictions, and well-managed and well-financed
cultivators will differentiate themselves by creating consistent, high-quality strains, developing strong
distribution relationships, vertically integrating other supply-chain functions and offering branded
products and competitive pricing. We also expect production services companies will benefit from
increasing demand for specialized extraction and manufacturing services that cultivators and other
production intermediaries cannot efficiently perform themselves, and providers of testing services will
benefit from increasingly robust testing and safety regulations. In the long run, we expect more per-
missive domestic and foreign laws will result in increased competition from large enterprises that are
able to realize economies of scale or have operations in regions best suited for efficient, sustainable
production.

= Distribution

We divide the distribution segment of the cannabis industry into three subsegments: dispensaries,
e-commerce and distribution services. Dispensaries are retail outlets where consumers purchase can-
nabis products for medical or recreational purposes. E-commerce includes digital applications used to
enhance the cannabis shopping experience. Distribution services include wholesale and related trans-
portation and logistics services. Participants in the distribution segment generally “touch the plant”
and therefore must comply with state and local regulations—which often require licenses or permits—
and must accept legal risks related to federal cannabis restrictions.

Dispensaries

Cannabis dispensaries are “point of sale” retail establishments where consumers may purchase medical
or recreational cannabis products. Cannabis dispensaries are the face of the cannabis industry in many
communities and, consequently, they occupy one of the most heavily regulated and scrutinized posi-
tions in the cannabis supply chain.

Dispensaries in established state-legal markets provide consumers with a typical retail shopping
experience. Dispensaries typically range in size from 1,000 to 10,000 square feet of retail space. A dis-
pensary may offer between 10 to 50 strains of cannabis flower and a variety of concentrates, edibles,
topicals and accessories. Inventory is either acquired from cultivators and other wholesale product
suppliers, or cultivated and produced internally. Products may be illustrated in menus or displayed on
shelves and may also be available for customers to touch, smell or otherwise examine. Trained customer
service staff, often known as “budtenders,” are typically available to educate customers about product
offerings.

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021302.txt,"general domain of sociality and social
relationships, a domain heavily
influenced by our genetic constitution as
a social species. Indeed, the importance
of sociality may be more related to
beliefs and attitudes about the
meaningfulness of relationships than
their existence or number. And again,
beliefs about social relationships also
have real consequences.

Conclusion

Beliefs impact thoughts and
actions. This may be reflected in
phenomena as diverse as biasing a
behavioral disposition (such as slapping
a donkey), coloring our perception of the
environment, or determining how we
perceive the quality of our social
(including spiritual) relations.
Psychology can also impact physiology,
and physiology, in turn, can influence
our thoughts and emotions.
Psychophysiology is the study of these
relationships, and promises to illuminate
the intricacies of psychosomatic
relations and the heretofore “invisible”
mechanisms that mediate these links.
The relations between the mind and the
body, the so-called mind-body problem,
are complex and still rather obscure.
Nevertheless, the mind-body problem is
yielding to science, and the problem it
poses is progressively diminishing.
Among the components of the mind-
body problem yielding to rigorous
scientific inquiry are the effects of
spiritual beliefs including feelings of
closeness to God.

Rationale

SPX has traded range bound since inception of the trade, still the carry has been minimal, close
out or roll the position

nwind the option post the state election event and Close position

The call vs call relative value trade is now riskier given the potential reversal in US reflation trades
and the potential for European equities to rally in a French election market-favourable outcome.
Unwind the position for the Tencent earnings

Option expired; HSCEI was up 5.1% but the SPX ended above 2200

Unwind post Mar-17 expiry; the short Sep 17 put helped reduce the hedging cost

Option expired; HSCEI stayed flat and failed to rally above the 10800 call strike

Apr17 option expired so we unwind the entire trade as planned

Unwind before May expiry following the large 4% SX5E move on 24-Apr, given lack of near term
catalysts

In Nov-16, we recommended remaining long equities with cheap hedges. The hedge expires out
of the money, while SPX has returned 8.7% for the period

The reflation trade has slowed down and the market is in a holding pattern. The long Apr-17 call
expires in-the-money, and the short Dec-17 call still has time value

The call spread still has value due to elevated vol and vol-of-vol and we collect the premium on
the expired short OTM put

The trade benefited from the rise in post-event volatility relative to pre-event volatility

The option expired
Single stock option expired in-the-money despite a 1.4% decline in the HSCEI

Single stock option expired in-the-money despite a 1.4% decline in the HSCEI
Single stock option expired in-the-money despite a 1.4% decline in the HSCEI
SX5E has rallied 23.3% since we entered the trade and European political risk abated for now

Option expired; KOSPI2 rallied 8.37% over the period

Option expired; KOSPI2 rallied 8.37% over the period
Closing the trade post French election; option strikes remain far from the spot level

Expired
Expired

The hedge expired out-of-the-money as S&P 500 remained supported

EFA rallied strongly leading into the second round of the French elections but subsequently stalled
Expired
Option expired; Both HSI and SPX puts expire out-of-the-money
Option expired; Nifty failed to move more than the straddle huddle (5%)

Option expired; HSBC is up 6.75% on the back of a strong seasonal rally
Closing the trade on expiry; Japan market rallied but options remain out of the money

Closing the trade on expiry; Japan market rallied but options remain out of the money

Closing the trade on expiry; Japan market rallied but options remain out of the money

Closing the trade on Jun17 expiry; Global volatility collapsed in 1H2017

Recent political turmoil in Brazil surrounding Temer's presidency caused a slide in the Brazilian
equity market and the BRL

In Dec-16, we recommended remaining long equities overlayed with cheap hedges. The hedge
expires out of the money, while SPX has returned 10.2% for the period

Following the US election and the initial move in rates, XLF rallied and subsequently stalled. In the
same period, the defensive sectors played the catch-up trade

Concerns over US tax reform implementation caused small-caps to underperform relative to other
equity markets, including EM

The trade captured the recent Tech sector outperformance in a period when Financials lagged
driven by lower rates

division between periods of peace and of war.

That the knotting together of distance, speed and power changes the nature of an
object was something Janelle, the father of “Space Time Compression,” anticipated.
He labeled it “Locational Utility’, the way in which something becomes more useful
or powerful or relevant as it is drawn closer to us by increased connection and
speed, even if it stays the same “distance” away’. A nuclear weapon three hours
from landing and one that is three months away are, nearly, a different object
entirely. Adam Smiths’s famous remark in his Theory of Moral Sentiments that most
people would be more perturbed by the loss of half a finger than the news that a
million Chinese had perished, begins to take on a different color in an age when a
billion and a half Chinese are nanoseconds away.2°? When we say that connection
changes the nature of an object, we mean this; Networks change the “locational
utility” of anything they touch. When connection makes an object instantly, clearly
visible, it revolutionizes its potential. Little wonder so many great fortunes are being
made in applying this trick of plugging goods into compression engines like apps or
matching services. It’s hard to know if firms like Airbnb or Uber will be around ina
decade, but the economic energy they release emerges right out of Janelle’s theories:
Connect a car seat or an empty room and you change its nature. You give it value.
Part of our unease now - and part of the problem we have in strategizing about the
world or our businesses - is that stability on our topological maps is some time off
yet. There is so much yet to be connected. So many new topologies to be built.

“Time is a ride,” Danny Hillis once remarked in an early meditation about his rock-
sunk clock, “and you are on it.”2°4 He was right. That ride takes place, in a connected
age, on topological rails. And just how “instant” you are will be a mark of what sort
of ride you're on. In the same way that rivers and oceans and mountains define
different landscapes in real geographies, topological neighborhoods too will each
bounce with funny quirks. Some will be super fast. Others yoked by politics. Citizens
of Santa Fe or Mumbai may choose to compress time in different ways. But they will
all share a common desire. To do more with less. The German philosopher Peter
Sloterdjik, writing about the way in which some people breeze through airports and
borders (with first class tickets and pre-approved immigration) while others
struggle to move at all out of refugee camps or poverty traps, has labeled the
winners of this new order as a kind of “kinetic elite”2°5. They are a kind of temporal
elite, in possession of golden keys to a special, frictionless topology. The technology
to eliminate space and capture time.

cousins is both the overall geometry of the brain in terms of the relative size of different components, as
well as the connections both within and between these components. Some of the most spectacular
changes evolved within the frontal and temporal lobes, as well as their connections to other areas of the
brain involved in the control of emotion and stress. These circuits play a critical role in decision making,
self control, short-term memory, social relationships, tool use and language.

For detail, and further evidence of the importance of connectivity in promiscuous thinking, we
turn to brain imaging studies of healthy adults, developing children, and patient populations that lack the
signature of promiscuity. Consider tool use. Though a wide variety of nonhuman animals use tools, only
humans create tools that combine different materials, have multiple functioning parts, can be used for
functions other than the one originally designed, and function in the context of survival, reproduction, and
leisure. These properties are the signature of a promiscuous brain. When we look at the material culture of
the most sophisticated animal tool user — the chimpanzee — we see tools that use a single material, have
only a single functional part, are only designed for one function, and the function set is strictly limited to
survival or reproduction. Something as simple as a pencil, beyond the chimpanzees’ wildest imagination,
consists of multiple materials (rubber, wood, lead, metal), was designed for writing but can be used for
poking or keeping hair up in a bun, and has two functional parts (lead for writing, rubber for erasing).
When you put a human subject in a brain scanner and record activity during observations of tool use,
what you see is an orchestrated coordination between different and connected brain regions. There is
activity in regions carrying out spatial analyses, motor behavior, goal directed assessments, and object
recognition, and much of this activity is fed forward to the frontal areas for storage in working memory as
well as judgment and evaluation. A healthy adult brain is a heavily connected brain. Promiscuity results
from a network of interconnected brain regions.

Even resting brains show signs of promiscuity. When you lie down in bed and close your eyes,
but before you drift off to sleep, your brain — assuming you are an adult and healthy — shows activity in
a family of inter-connected brain regions called the default network. This is your brain at rest, but it is
anything but at rest. Some of the most active areas involve those that are engaged when we evaluate
social relationships, consider what others believe and desire, who they are, and how we might interact in
the future. This same default network looks very different in children, as well as in the elderly: it is much
less connected. Growing up is connecting up. Growing old is disconnecting. We gain promiscuous
thinking as we mature and lose it as we age.

If connection is key, then disorders of the mind or physical insult should result in predictable loss
of promiscuity. A brain imaging study of individuals with autism is revealing. Individuals with autism

fall along a spectrum, from low to high functioning. Though this spectrum captures important

Private sector participation and investment will be crucial...

Whilst the government has earmarked cUS$2bn for the expansion of FTTH and wireless
infrastructure (with a view to ultimately increasing internet usage), we believe this will
likely be insufficient to meet the needs of the NTP’s ambitious targets (based on costs
of rolling out existing wireless and FTTH networks). As such, we believe the private
sector (Zain KSA, Mobily and STC) will be key contributors to the financing of the
expansion plan.

..intensifying the case for creation of a Saudi tower company

The Saudi telecom service providers have invested heavily in rolling out high speed
wireless networks and, in the case of Mobily and STC, FTTH networks (not to mention
license costs). This has seen the balance sheets of both Mobily and Zain KSA reaching
relatively high gearing levels; thereby limiting their ability to step up capital expenditure
for a sustained period. Consequently, we believe the focus on raising capital (to fund the
expansion programmes) from the spin out of their Tower portfolios will only increase.
We see Zain KSA as the key beneficiary of this given they have the most highly geared
balance sheet amongst Saudi Telco peers.

Mobile market share gains for Zain KSA and Mobily increasingly important

Whilst the Saudi government has taken steps to introduce competition in the
telecommunications industry, its moves to open the market have thus fallen short of
this objective. Specifically, government-owned STC retains more than 60% revenue
market share in Saudi Arabia, giving it a dominant position in the market, whilst Mobily
and Zain KSA have only managed to achieve c25% and 15% revenue market share
respectively.

This, in our view, has likely been driven by a number of factors including: (1) the
relatively high cost of market entry (ie licenses) for both Mobily and Zain KSA, which has
lumbered both with high operating costs; (2) high royalty costs, which amount to c16%
of revenues generated in Saudi Arabia (with some exceptions, including data), arguably
inhibiting requisite marketing and infrastructure spend. We note both Mobily and Zain
KSA remain loss making; and, (3) the relatively high mobile termination rates, which
arguably afford an advantage to STC and prevent Zain or Mobily from competing more
aggressively on price.

For the realisation of the NTP, we believe it is important that all private sector players
are realising sufficient rates of return and FCF generation to be able to finance the

requisite growth in infrastructure. We note both Mobily and Zain KSA were loss making
in 2015 and are expected to return sub 5% ROE’s in both 2016 and 2017 (according to

AFFIDAVIT OF BRADLEY JAMES EDWARDS

I am an attorney in good standing with the Florida Bar and admitted to practice in the
Southern District of Florida. I am currently a partner in the law firm of Farmer, Jaffe,
Weissing, Edwards, Fistos & Lehrman, P.L.

In 2008, I was a sole practitioner running a personal injury law firm in Hollywood, FL.
While a sole practitioner I was retained by three clients, Ml WWMM, and Jane Doe to
pursue civil litigation against Jeffrey Epstein for sexually abusing them while they were
minor girls. I agreed to. represent these girls, along with attorney Jay Howell (an
attomey in Jacksonville, Florida with Jay Howell & Associates) and Professor Paul
Cassell (a law professor at the University of Utah College Of Law). I filed state court
actions on behalf of L.M. and E.W. and a federal court action on behalf of Jane Doe.
All of the cases were filed in the summer of 2008.

My clients received correspondence from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding
their rights as victims of Epstein’s federal sex offenses. (True and accurate copies of
the letters are attached to Statement of Undisputed Facts as Exhibit “M”)

In mid June 2008, I contacted Assistant United States Attorney Marie Villafafia to
inform her that I represented Jane Doe #1.) and, later, Jane Doe #2@@M). I asked
to meet to provide information regarding Epstein. AUSA Villafafia did not advise me
that a plea agreement had already been negotiated with Epstein’s attomeys that would
block federal prosecution. AUSA Villafafia did indicate that federal investigators had
concrete evidence and information that Epstein had sexually molested at least 40
underage minor females, including J. Jane Doe and

I also requested from the U.S. Attorney’s Office the information and evidence that they
had collected regarding Epstein’s sexual abuse of his clients. However, the U.S.
Attorney’s Office declined to provide any such information to me. The U.S. Attorney’s
Office also declined to provide any such information to the other attorneys who
represented victims of Epstein’s sexual assaults.

I was informed that on Friday, June 27, 2008, at approximately 4:15 p.m., AUSA
Viilafaiia received a copy of Epstein’s proposed state plea agreement and learned that the
plea was scheduled for 8:30 a.m., Monday, June 30, 2008. She called me to provide
notice to my clients regarding the hearing. She did not tell me that the guilty pleas in
state court would bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the
plea agreement. My clients did not learn and understand this fact until July 11, 2008,
when the agreement was described during a hearing held before Judge Marra on the
Crime Victims’ Rights Act action that I had filed.

In the summer of 2008 I filed complaints against Jeffrey Epstein on behalf of i,
E.W., and Jane Doe.

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013468

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019425.txt,"The charges included “IV therapy,” billed at $787 for the adult and $393 for the child, which suggests that the difference in
the amount of saline infused, typically less than a liter, could alone account for several hundred dollars.

Tricia O’Malley, a spokeswoman for the hospital, would not disclose the price it pays per IV bag or break down the therapy
charge, which she called the hospital’s “private pay rate,” or the sticker price charged to people without insurance. She said

she could not explain why patients covered by Medicaid were billed at all.

Eventually the head of the family, an electrician’s helper who speaks little English, complained to HealthFirst, the Medicaid
H.M.O. It paid $119 to settle the grandmother’s $2, 168 bill, without specifying how much of the payment was for the IV. It
paid $66.50 to the doctor, who had billed $606.

At White Plains Hospital, a patient with private insurance from Aetna was charged $91 for one unit of Hospira IV that cost the
hospital 86 cents, according to a hospital sookeswoman, Eliza O'Neill.

Ms. O’Neill defended the markup as “consistent with industry standards.” She said it reflected “not only the cost of the
solution but a variety of related services and processes,” like procurement, biomedical handling and storage, apparently not
included in a charge of $127 for administering the IV and $893 for emergency-room services.

The patient, a financial services professional in her 50s, ended up paying $100 for her visit. “Honestly, | don’t understand the
system at all,” said the woman, who shared the information on the condition that she not be named.

Dr. Frost, the anesthesiologist, spent three days in the same hospital and owed only $8, thanks to insurance coverage by
United HealthCare. Still, she was baffled by the charges: $6,844, including $546 for six liters of saline that cost the hospital
$5.16.

“It’s just absolutely absurd.” she said. “That’s saltwater.”

Last fall, | appealed to the New York State Department of Health for help in mapping the charges for rehydrating patients in
the food poisoning episode. Deploying software normally used to detect Medicaid fraud, a team compiled a chart of what

Medicaid and Medicare were billed in six of the cases.

But the department has yet to release the chart. It is under indefinite review, Bill Schwarz, a department spokesman, said,
“to ensure confidential information is not compromised.”

States scramble to get health-care law’s insurance marketplaces up and running
Sarah Kliff and Sandhya Somashekhar - Washington Post

With a key deadline approaching, state officials across the country are scrambling to get the Affordable Care Act’s complex
computer systems up and running, reviewing contingency plans and, in some places, preparing for delays.

Oct. 1 is the scheduled launch date for the health-care law’s insurance marketplaces — online sites where uninsured people
will be able to shop for coverage, sometimes using a government subsidy to purchase a plan. An estimated 7 million people
are expected to use these portals to purchase health coverage in 2014.

The task is unprecedented in its complexity, requiring state and federal data systems to transmit reams of information
between one another. Some officials in charge of setting up the systems say that the tight deadlines have forced them to
take shortcuts when it comes to testing and that some of the bells and whistles will not be ready.

“There’s a certain level of panic about how much needs to be accomplished but a general sense that the bare minimum to
get the system functional will be done,” said Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors.

“It will by no means be as smooth and as seamless as people expected.”

Oregon announced this month that it will delay consumers’ direct access to its marketplace, opening the Web site only to
brokers and consumer-assistance agents in order to shield consumers from opening-day glitches.

Moves To Take Down Pence. 
An MSNBC panel says that former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn has information that could take down Vice 
President Mike Pence. Flynn may have leaked information that shows Pence and the Trump transition team knew 
that foreign governments were paying him. 
If this information turns out to be true, it would be a devastating blow to the Vice President's reputation. So far, Pence is 
untouched by the Russia scandal. 
The prevailing opinion is that Pence didn't know anything about Flynn's calls to the Russian ambassador to the U.S. And 
the administration's story is that Flynn lied about his Russian contacts to Pence.

IT'S HAPPENING: Trump Insider TURNS On Trump, Asks For Plea Deal to Expose Trump. 
But these new leaks fly in the face of all this. They suggest that Pence knew about all of Flynn's dealingswith foreign 
governments and chose to ignore them. 
Additionally, Pence was the head of the Trump transition team and was supposed to vet all of Trump's appointees. So he 
should have known about Flynn's work with Turkey and Russia. 
So either Pence is incompetent, or he's an outright liar. Neither is a good quality for a Vice President. 
Washington Post reporter Karen Tumulty also stated that Pence was in the Oval Office right before President Trump asked 
Comey to drop the Flynn investigation. So Pence may also have been involved in Trump's efforts to obstruct the 
investigation into Flynn and the Russia scandal. 
Flynn may not have finished with Pence, either. Bloomberg Politics editor John Heilemann showed how Flynn can keep the 
pressure on Pence. 
Heilemann said, Either he [Pence] knew and is lying or he did not know and was wildly incompetent. Either way, not a 
great story for him. 
By the way, it seems to me the import of this story is that Michael Flynn's lawyer came out a couple of months ago and 
said that Mike Flynn had a story to tell, continued Heilemann. He's now starting to tell that story. 
POLL: Is the whole Trump administration going down? 
The Trump administration claims that Vice President Mike Pence didn't know anything about Michael Flynn's work with 
the Russian or Turkish governments. 
But Flynn has allegedly released information contradicting these claims. 
Is Flynn trying to take down the whole Trump administration? Share your opinion in the poll below. 
Heilemann suggested that Flynn might be leaking these stories in 
order to get immunity. Flynn's hoping that he can prove his story is 
worth enough to gain immunity from prosecution. 
If this is the thing that he's leaking, and there are other things that he's still holding to offer in exchange for immunity, that 
means this isn't even the worst of it___that means he's got more things to say, said Heilemann. 
If that's true, that means there's more bad news coming for Pence and Trump. Flynn could help take down both men. 
It looking more and more like Pence is also guilty of treason. So Congress should impeach Pence as well as Trump. 
Unfortunately, that would put House Speaker Paul Ryan in charge. But at least he's not in the Russian President's pocket. 
Flynn's trying to get his revenge and take down the Vice President. Please share this story on Facebook to show that Pence 
isn't as innocent as we've been led to believe.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012762.txt,"In a competitive world with limited resources, our desire system never rests. This is a good thing
as it motivates us to take care of our self-interests and strive for bigger and better. But a desire system
that never sleeps is a system that 1s motivated to accrue ever larger coffers or power. To satisfy this
inflationary need is often not possible without harming others, either directly or indirectly. To offset the
costs of harming another, desire recruits denial. This is a recipe for evil and the creation of excessive
harms. It is a recipe that takes two, often benign and highly adaptive ingredients that are essential for
motivating action and promoting survival, and combines them into an explosive outcome. Seen in this
way, our capacity for evil is as great as our capacity for love and compassion. Evil is part of human
nature, a capacity that can’t be denied. What I will show is both how this capacity works, and how some
of us, due to biological inheritance and environmental influence, are more likely to end up as evildoers.

Historical material on the lives of Franz Stangl and Adolf Eichmann, leaders in the Nazi
annihilation of Jews, illustrates how desire and denial combine within individual minds to create
excessive harms. Although this is a historical example, focused on the lives of only two men, stories like
theirs have been recounted hundreds of times, all over the globe and across time. This pattern points to
common mechanisms, identified in detail by the sciences of human nature.

Stangl was a politically motivated man with a burning desire to climb to the top of the Nazi
hierarchy. A clear path opened when he was appointed commander of the Polish prison Treblinka.
Unbeknownst to Stangl, Treblinka was one of the Nazi’s concentration death camps. To fulfill his desire
for power therefore required harming thousands of others, or more accurately, commanding Nazi soldiers
to harm others on his behalf. But since Stangl had no burning desire to harm the Jews, he dehumanized
them, transforming living, breathing, feeling, and thinking people into lifeless “cargo” — his own
expression. Stang] was dry-eyed as officers under his command killed close to one million Jews, one
third of them children. The reward? Power and status within the Nazi hierarchy. The death of innocent
Jews was a foreseen consequence of Stangl’s desire for power, not his direct goal.

Eichmann, Lieutenant Colonel in the Nazi regime, was considered one of the central architects of
the Final Solution, the master plan for the extermination of Jews. Eichmann denied Jews their humanity
by championing the pamphlets and posters that portrayed them as vermin and parasites. This
dehumanizing transformation empowered Eichmann’s belief that cleansing was the only solution to
German integrity and power. Eichmann’s reward? Elimination of the Jews. Unlike Stangl, killing Jews
was rewarding. As the historian Yaacov Lozowick stated “Eichmann and his ilk did not come to murder
Jews by accident or in a fit of absent-mindedness, nor by blindly obeying orders or by being small cogs in
a big machine. They worked hard, thought hard, took the lead over many years. They were the alpinists of

evil.”

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019431.txt,"Calestous Juma, international development professor at the Kennedy school of government and a nominator, judge and
promoter of new types of prizes, sees awards as part of a complex ecology of financing innovation that includes many other
instruments. He believes there should be more prizes for humanitarian work and development.

Doing humanitarian work may look like a thankless job. Yet itis driven by the instinct of empathy that makes us human,
said Juma, author of The New Harvest: Agricultural Innovation in Africa. Honouring, rewarding, celebrating and inspiring
work in this area is more needed today than ever. This is an area that can use more societal recognition, especially at a time
when the whole aid industry is under scrutiny.

However, Juma says prizes need to be carefully thought out. Many organisations are launching them without thinking
carefully about what prizes can do or cannot do.

The AidEx challenge's lead judge, Michael Pritchard, inventor of the Lifesaver water bottle, says the award is not so much
about the money — £2,000 — as validation, although the publicity can be a much-needed boost.

The validation goes an awfully long way to get the product developed and provides a big leg-up into getting it into the
market, he said. It gets written up all over the world and gets the oxygen of publicity.

As for Thakkar, he says winning the AidEx award has been a positive experience: Winning the award made a huge

difference, it increased publicity. People look more favourably on us and [that] gives us an extra edge. We don't have to sell it
as much. But we don't want to be just appreciated, we want the lamp to be used extensively.

A Chance at Learning
Ginia Bellafante — New York Times

This year, a study administered by researchers at Harvard and Stanford drew significant attention for what it revealed about
how inadequately low-income students are represented at selective colleges and universities. Only 34 percent of the
highest-achieving high-school seniors whose families fell in the bottom quarter of income distribution — versus 78 percent
in the top quarter — attended one of the country’s most selective colleges, based ona list of nearly 250 schools compiled by
Barron’s.

In New York City, where a neighborhood like Bushwick, in Brooklyn, can seem like a satellite campus of Wesleyan and a
prewar apartment building on the Upper East Side can feel like an lvy League dormitory for 46-year-olds, there has been
considerable philanthropic attention, of the kind other cities ought to envy, paid to finding the most gifted low-income
students and putting them ona similar path.

In 1978, Gary Simons, a Bronx teacher, founded Prep for Prep with the goal of identifying talented students of color in the
city and readying them for attendance at private schools like Dalton and Groton and so on. Hundreds of the program’s
alumni have gone on to law, medical and business schools, and employment at Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and
Time Warner.

Adecade ago, hoping also to advance the best students attending public high schools, Mr. Simons and others founded
another organization, Leadership Enterprise for a Diverse America, or LEDA, which draws exceptional children from around
the country, regardless of race, almost entirely from families who make less than $55,000 a year. Applicants are required to
be in the top 10 percent of their class, having taken the most difficult courses their schools offer. The 60 who gain entry to the
program each year spend the summer before 12th grade at Princeton, studying ethics, political theory and public policy, and
preparing for standardized college entrance exams.

In awondrous righting of the current disequilibrium, however small its scale, they are tutored for those tests by the same
instructors who work with some of Manhattan’s wealthiest teenagers: the staff of Advantage Testing, whose services cost
parents up to $795 an hour. Arun Alagappan, the founder and president of Advantage and a major benefactor of LEDA,
provides his employees (whose résumés typically resemble those of the people at Google or McKinsey) pro bono.

I hope all is well with you. As per Peggy Siegal's office, I have included here the invitation to the IFP Gotham Awards 
ceremony, which will be held on Monday, November 27 at Cipriani Wall Street in New York City. 
This year's ceremony is going to be another successful event. We couldn't be more thrilled with this year's impressive 
group of Tributees. The Actress Tribute will go to Nicole Kidman and the Actor Tribute to Dustin Hoffman. The 
Director Tribute will be given to Sofia Coppola, with the Cinematographer Tribute going to Ed Lachman. With the

Industry Tribute, we will be honoring Jason Blum, founder of Blumhouse Productions. And we simply couldn't be more 
pleased to honor Vice President Al Gore with this year's special Humanitarian Tribute. With nominees this year 
ranging from Willem Dafoe, Adam Sandler and Robert Pattison to Margot Robbie, Lois Smith and Mary J. Bilge, this 
year's ceremony looks to be the most star studded ever. 
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: Financials trade for Monday

It’s not too late to buy financials as a medium term trade. They’ve run up a lot this week but we’re getting
endless calls from generalists asking which banks to buy — there is still more upside to the sector. Banks also
provide some offset to your bonds if interest rates continue to move. Our financials sector specialist thinks XLF
could have another 20-25% upside given its many levers to the Trump trade: less regulation, higher interest
rates/steeper yield curve, higher vol, economic growth, etc. The regional banks are asset sensitive and more of a
pure play on a rates move but we view the larger cap banks as having even more upside to the Trump Trade
given the above points.

Buy an XLF 17March2017 call spread:
° Buy the 105% call / sell a 110% call with a 115% at-expiry knock-in
° Total premium: 1.75%

All eyes are on Sunday’s 60 Minutes interview with Trump. Market is pricing that all regulations will be rolled
back (very optimistic). Any hint that this is not true could lead to pullback on Monday.

Note on tech: we’re seeing FANG used as a source of funds with the rotation from growth into value. There’s
also the tax read-through: tech is already relatively tax advantaged @ 22%; Industrials are at 30%, Financials at
29%. Next year, tech could benefit from a repatriation tax holiday but that is viewed as more of a Q1/Q? trade.

More thoughts on financials:

With respect to the economy, the market is certainly indicating that there will be a large fiscal stimulus which
may send US growth higher and that’s a good thing for financials for a wide variety of reasons, from
employment to wages to loan growth and credit quality (even if somewhat offset by higher rates). It does
remain to be seen exactly how much of this expected policy actually gets done, but at the moment, investors are
willing to take a certain amount of growth on faith.

So those are positives for financials before we even discuss regulation. The move in the financials since the
election would seem to indicate that investors have concluded that nearly every piece of financial regulation
will get put into a shredder on day one of the new administration. The incoming administration has fueled that
with comments about rolling back pieces (or more) of Dodd-Frank in particular. I can see making the case for
that to the American public by saying that banks need less regulation in order to get more capital flowing into
the economy to drive growth. Not only does that mean that the E is likely too low (meaning that the P/E is not
as high as it seems) but it could help improve ROE’s as well which could increase the multiple of that higher E
investors are willing to pay. Note that while ROEs could go higher, it’s unlikely that they can get back to the
peaks...

Amanda

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021316.txt,"correspond if the observer were doing
the same thing. Another way to say this
is that there is a resonant response in an
observer’s motor system to observing a
behavior and this may potentiate a
degree of social coordination and
connection, as discussed in Semin’s
chapter. This kind of neural resonance
has been shown to play a role in
understanding speech when seeing a
talker’s mouth move, even if the listener
does not actually make any mouth
movements.

Mirror neurons demonstrate that
observed action can produce a resonant
response in an observer’s brain. Seeing
a talker’s mouth move creates a motor-
resonant response that aids in
understanding speech sounds. However,
these two observations are very different
from the idea that the meaning of
sentences can create a resonant response
in the listener’s brain. In the case of
speech, mouth movements are the
actions that create speech. This might
seem like a very special case. The
traditional linguistic view of language is
that words and sentences are symbolic:
Language describing action is not action
itself. Language describing emotion is
not the emotion itself. The entire
concept of a symbol is that a symbol
denotes something, stands for
something, but the symbol is not the
thing itself. But it now appears that this
long-held notion may be wrong.

The idea that seeing an object or
event gives rise to brain states that
resonate with previous experiences of
that thing suggests a mechanism for
language understanding to go beyond
symbolic interpretation. Given that there
is a brain mechanism for re-experiencing
actions or sensations, this same
mechanism may operate even when
there is just a symbolic linguistic

description. Understanding language
may take place by invoking such
resonant past experiences in the brain.

For example, when listening to
sentences about hockey action, hockey
players show neural activity in their
motor system which is not seen for
people who are naive to hockey.’
Experience playing hockey recruits the
motor system in service of
understanding hockey sentences as if
one were watching or playing hockey
when only listening to speech. This
suggests one way in which language can
have a direct impact on a listener.
Rather than making inferences about
actions based on the meanings of
sentences, understanding a sentence may
be a resonant motor system response in
the listener to a description of an action.
If this idea is extended more broadly,
language impact may come from such
resonant responses. Language
understanding and the impact of
language may result from processes
more similar to the effects of hearing
laughter. Hearing a sentence may create
in a listener a set of resonant responses
very similar to the patterns that
correspond to the actual situations being
described.

Such resonant responses need not
be confined to the motor system and
actions. Emotions such as fear or joy
may be empathically evoked in listeners
by speech just as a scream or laughter
might. Verbal expression of attitudes
may produce similar attitudinal
responses in listeners. Moreover, if a
listener’s resonant response is strong,
there may be increased empathic overlap
with the speaker, which may serve to
increase social connection. To the
extent that people speak together and
share feelings, social connection may
increase as well.

European equities ended the week lower mainly due to a tech-driven sell-off on 12-Jun

the UK’s EU referendum. Nevertheless, implied vols across European indices remained
mostly unchanged near 2 year lows.

10-year low in Mar-17 driven by post US election reflation trades but is now
rising off its lows likely driven by an unwind of reflation trades.

- §SX7E implied-realised correlation near 5-year highs: SX7E 6m implied
correlation fell since Mar-17 but the implied-realised correlation spread remains
in the 88 5-year percentile driven by even lower realised correlation.

* _ESTX50 3M put skew is near 5 year highs, in stark contrast to SXEP
(European Oil & Gas equity) put skew which is close to 5 year lows.

* The overall seasonality in ESTX50 realised volatility since 1987 has been one of
relatively lower vol during the summer months vs. autumn. In particular, May
stands out as the lowest vol month across most 10 year horizons, and this
also appears to be the case so far this year.

EU Intra-sector correl continues to decline while inter-sector correl is supported
The average European intra-sector 3m correlation is near a 10-year low, partly driven by
divergence within the personal & household goods, utilities, real-estate, autos and
insurance sectors (Chart 18 and Table 3). Interestingly, the average 3m inter-sector
correlation reached a 10-year low on 14-Mar-17 (as the 8-Nov-16 US election led to the
outperformance of sectors sensitive to inflation) but inter-sector correlation now seems
supported likely driven by the unwind of reflation trades (Chart 18).

Machine.)”189

Hillis’s ambition to build this device boiled in him while he was at MIT, and it finally
outstripped what MIT could support, so he gathered a group of students and started
a small company. The Thinking Machines Corporation, blessed by some combination
of Hillis’s charisma and the fantastic promise of the project, became a magnetic field
for talent, ideas and money. In the early days of the firm, for instance, the hunt for
investors led Danny to the luxurious New York City apartment of William Paley, the
founder of CBS. Hillis lived then in a ramshackle house close to campus at MIT. He
drove a surplus fire truck to work most days.1%° Faced with the urbane, powerful 81-
year old founder of the largest radio and TV network in America, Danny jumped
right into a passionate introduction of his ideas about connection and networks.
Paley, cooly: I didn't understand a word you said. Then: A check for $5 million.

Or there was the time that Hillis asked Nobel-prize winning physicist Richard
Feynman to tip him off about any smart scientists Thinking Machines might hire.
Feynman, pushing 60, volunteered himself and spent his summer vacations for the
next ten years with Hillis and his team.1?! When it came time to test the first
Connection Machine, it was Feynman’s data that revealed how well the black box
was doing its job. The architecture they had designed cranked through what would
have been a month’s worth of complex chromodynamics problems in hours. As the
machine got better, these already fast processing times improved by another factor
of 1,000. Such a machine, for scientists who were desperate for computed answers,
was like adding years to their life. If they could solve a problem in a week instead of
years? The whole texture of their careers would be altered.

“At times,” one fellow computer developer remarked, “the Connection Machine
seems so different from current computers that it seems more akin to science fiction
than high technology.”!92 Thinking Machines Corporation sold Danny’s computers to
Lockheed to model stealth fighters. Chevron used one to model oil fields. The US
government bought several to help to predict the weather. Puzzles long resistant to
mere power melted in the face of parallel consideration. Nothing was more exciting
about Hillis’s machines than this intimiate, unprecedented link between intelligence
and speed. If you have twice as many processors as | do, you can perhaps crack a
puzzle of genomics or cryptography a year faster. But say you have figured out how
to have 275,000 machines linked together and I have 1,000? You can solve a

provide the judge with as much information as possible. The court is under no obligation to accept a plea proposed by the
155

parties. '°4 After hearing from the victim about the plea, the court can determine what weight to give to the victim's views.
To mplement the victim's right to be heard regarding a plea, the proposed rule change requires the court to directly address any
victim present in court. This is consistent with the CVRA's legislative history that explains that this provision is intended to
allow crime victims to directly address the court in person. !°° The language of the proposed rule is lifted from an earlier
paragraph in Rule 11, which requires the court to address the defendant personally in open court “before accepting a plea of
guilty. '°7 Victims should be treated even-handedly. It may be important for the judge to address victims directly because
many victims will lack the assistance of counsel. As novices in legal proceedings, victims may be uncertain about exactly when
in the process they should present their views. By addressing victims, the court will eliminate that uncertainty and ensure that
the victim's right to be heard is vindicated.

[*868]

Rule 11(c)(1) - Prosecution To Consider Victims' Views on Pleas

The Proposal:

The prosecution should be required to consider the victims' views in developing any proposed plea arrangement as follows:

(1) In General. An attorney for the government and the defendant's attorney, or the defendant when proceeding pro se, may
discuss and reach a plea agreement. The court must not participate in these discussions. The attorney for the government shall
make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider the victims’ views about, any proposed plea negotiations. If
the defendant pleads guilty or nolo contendere to either a charged offense or a lesser or related offense, the plea agreement may
specify that an attorney for the government will ... .

The Rationale:

The proposed change requires prosecutors to make reasonable efforts to notify victims about possible plea bargains and to
consider the victim's views regarding those pleas. This requirement is taken essentially verbatim from the Attorney General
Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance, which direct prosecutors to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims

153 See, e.g., Conn. Const. art. 1, 8 (giving victim right to be heard and to object to plea agreement); Mo. Const. art. 1, 32 (giving victim right
to be heard at plea hearing); Utah Const. art. I, 28(1)(b) (giving victim the right to be heard at important criminal justice hearings related to
the victim); Ala. Code 15-23-71 (2000) (giving victim right to be present at plea hearing and requiring prosecutor to confer with victim

about plea); Ariz. Rev. Stat. 13-4423 (2001) (giving victim right to be present and heard at plea hearing and requiring prosecutor to confer
with victim about plea); Afinn. Stat. Ann. 6114.03 (West 2003) (giving victim right to be heard at plea hearing); Miss. Code Ann. 99-43-33
(2000) (giving victim right to make statement at plea hearing); N.H. Rev. Stat. 2]-M:8-k (2000) (giving victim right to be heard at plea
hearing); R.I. Stat. 12-28-4.1 (2000) (giving victim right to make statement at plea hearing). See generally Beloof, Cassell & Twist, supra
note 15, at 476-94 (discussing victims and pleas); Sarah N. Welling, Victim Participation in Plea Bargains, 65 Wash. U. L.Q. 301 (1987).

154 See, e.g., United States v. Bean, 564 F.2d 700 (5th Cir. 1977).

155 But cf. George P. Fletcher, With Justice for Some: Victims' Rights in Criminal Trials 252, 257-58 (1995) (proposing that victims have a
veto over any plea); Bennett L. Gershman, Crimes Against Victims: The Prosecutor's Duty of Neutrality, 9 Lewis & Clark L. Rev.
(forthcoming 2005) (discussing situations in which victims have effectively been given a veto over pleas); Karen L. Kennard, Comment, The

secret political party with the vivid nightmares of a nation that had been invaded,
abused — humiliated, they said - by nine countries since the mid-19 Century Opium
Wars. “We used to worry about war and talk about its possibility every year,” Deng
told them. “It seems the worry was overdone.” The world was, he felt, entering an
era of heping yu fazhan - peace and development. Terrible, nation-demolishing wars
would not soon victimize China, Deng thought. Nation building was the nature of the
age. Its tools would be science, finance, and trade. If the Chinese people worked
hard, he promised his incredulous listeners, they might by the year 2000 grow their
thin $250 per capita income to the nearly unimaginable target of $1000. “I don’t
care if the cat is white or black,” he famously observed, “as long as it catches mice.”
Socialism? Capitalism? No matter so long as it produced progress. Deng’s judgment
proved out. There were no major wars. Development was, for China, the name of the
age. The cat caught $1000 dollars of per capita income nearly on the old man’s
schedule. It is still playing with the string.

There is something admirably direct about the Western way of problem solving, of
course. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. It has its uses. But
it’s also true that this sort of elementary geometry does not describe, always, the
best path. Particularly not today, in an era when topological collapse or instant
connection means that the distance from a to b can go to zero (or infinity) in a single
sudden shift. Yes, you may be stringing a line from a to b, but if you’re putting it up
in a tornado? Is the best route to a new Middle East really the tipping over of stable
states? Is the quickest path to climate control voluntary compacts? Are faster
markets and more unwatched capitalism the safest way to ameliorate our
unbalanced economics? Sometimes a more indirect line is called for. Sometimes it is
faster, safer. Huang Hua’s question - “Where is the world going, after all?” - turns
out to be the first essential one for any endeavor. Ifyou are not looking from the
highest possible altitude, Chinese will warn you, you are not seeing the full picture.

The nature of our age has, | think, emerged clearly, vividly and broadly for us now.
Constant, instant, everywhere connectivity taps with the efficient mercilessness of a
steel hammer on the glass of most of our comfortable institutions. The Seventh
Sense has let us understand a bit about the origins of this creative violence. And it
has shown us too that our era’s dominant feature is not merely cracking disruption,
but also the construction of new orders. Da po, Da li the Chinese might say - great
destruction and great construction. This is the nature of our age. Tap, tap, crack. And
then: Gatelands - speed-bred by technology and filled with possibility. That some of
these gated worlds contain billions of people or trillions of sensors, computer chips
or network nodes only strengthens their inexorable grip. That they can be so easily
or even accidentally weaponized marks the edginess of our problem. That they will
be built atop the sharp-edged shards of a collapsing older system heightens the
urgency at which they must emerge. To be inside, we've seen, delivers the light-
speed benefits of time compression, of life on a nearly alive mesh. To be outside? It
is to be cut off.

e High quality dividend yields (sourced from existing European ®
and UK equities)
High quality companies with geographically diversified business models
that pay sustainable dividends offer an attractive income stream in a
low yield world. Historically, dividends have made a substantial
contribution to total returns, and we expect this to remain the case in
the current environment.

e Western winners from emerging market growth (sourced from
existing equity holdings)
Emerging economies continue to grow faster than developed
economies. With little need to deleverage and repair balance sheets,
Asian economies are also well positioned to continue to outpace their
Western peers in the years ahead. We have identified companies from a
variety of sectors in Europe, the US and Japan which have significant
exposure to the rapidly growing emerging regions. We believe a
diversified portfolio of these companies will reward investors seeking
to profit from the robust demand growth in emerging economies.

e Natural gas growth gainers
Natural gas is a relatively clean source of energy, and we think it will
benefit from continued substitution for other energy sources over the
long term. We have examined the dynamics of the global market and
the various components of the gas value chain, and identified the areas
we see as the most significant beneficiaries currently. These include
producers in Europe and Asia, suppliers of infrastructure, services and
related machinery, and Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) in the US, )
that offer both attractive yields and growth.

Government bond alternatives (sourced from government bonds
- ClO UW)

Developed world government bonds offer a comparatively small cushion
against future interest rate hikes and many face increasing credit risk. We
expect select bonds of supranational or national agencies, sub-national
governments, multinational corporates, and covered bonds to
outperform government bonds. We recommend switching out of
government bonds into these alternatives.

US high yield corporate bonds (sourced from government bonds -
clo UW)

Positive economic growth, robust corporate earnings and healthy
balance sheets provide support to US high yield corporate bonds. Current
yield spreads of roughly 660 basis points still price in a much more dire
economic outcome than we expect. Historically, US high yield bonds have
delivered similar returns to US equities with lower volatility. We continue
to believe that US high yield corporate bonds represent a more favorable
risk/return potential than equities and expect total returns of
approximately 7% over the next 6 months.

The place to be in Hedge Funds

Recent economic data has shown signs of improvement, but growth in
most developed markets remains muted. In this environment, less
directional hedge fund strategies, such as relative value and event driven,
should offer above average returns.

EM corporates: a growing asset class (sourced from global
government bonds - CIO UW)

Given our relatively constructive current view on risk, we regard EM
corporate debt as more attractive than EM sovereign debt due to its
higher overall yield. Over a 6-month horizon, we expect EM corporate
bonds to outperform US Treasuries and deliver total returns of close to
8% p.a.

annual filing with SEC and in annual reports. Additionally,
the parent's legal department approved the retention of the
third-party agent through whom the bribes were arranged
despite a lack of documented due diligence and an agency
agreement that violated corporate policy; also, an official of
the parent approved one of the payments to the third-party
agent.'*! Under these circumstances, the parent company
had sufficient knowledge and control of its subsidiary’s
actions to be liable under the FCPA.

Successor Liability

Companies acquire a host of liabilities when they
merge with or acquire another company, including those aris-
ing out of contracts, torts, regulations, and statutes. As a gen-
eral legal matter, when a company merges with or acquires
another company, the successor company assumes the prede-
cessor company’s liabilities.’* Successor liability is an integral
component of corporate law and, among other things, pre-
vents companies from avoiding liability by reorganizing.'”
Successor liability applies to all kinds of civil and criminal
liabilities,!** and FCPA violations are no exception. Whether
successor liability applies to a particular corporate transac-
tion depends on the facts and the applicable state, federal,
and foreign law. Successor liability does not, however, create
liability where none existed before. For example, if an issuer
were to acquire a foreign company that was not previously
subject to the FCPA’s jurisdiction, the mere acquisition of
that foreign company would not retroactively create FCPA
liability for the acquiring issuer.

DOJ and SEC encourage companies to conduct pre-
acquisition due diligence and improve compliance pro-
grams and internal controls after acquisition for a variety
of reasons. First, due diligence helps an acquiring company
to accurately value the target company. Contracts obtained
through bribes may be legally unenforceable, business
obtained illegally may be lost when bribe payments are
stopped, there may be liability for prior illegal conduct, and
the prior corrupt acts may harm the acquiring company’s
reputation and future business prospects. Identifying these

issues before an acquisition allows companies to better

The FCPA:

Anti-Bribery Provisions

evaluate any potential post-acquisition liability and thus
properly assess the target's value.'® Second, due diligence
reduces the risk that the acquired company will continue to
pay bribes. Proper pre-acquisition due diligence can iden-
tify business and regional risks and can also lay the founda-
tion for a swift and successful post-acquisition integration
into the acquiring company’s corporate control and com-
pliance environment. Third, the consequences of potential
violations uncovered through due diligence can be handled
by the parties in an orderly and efficient manner through
negotiation of the costs and responsibilities for the inves-
tigation and remediation. Finally, comprehensive due dili-
gence demonstrates a genuine commitment to uncovering
and preventing FCPA violations.

In a significant number of instances, DOJ and
SEC have declined to take action against companies
that voluntarily disclosed and remediated conduct
and cooperated with DOJ and SEC in the merger and
acquisition context. And DOJ and SEC have only
taken action against successor companies in limited cir-
cumstances, generally in cases involving egregious and
sustained violations or where the successor company
directly participated in the violations or failed to stop the
misconduct from continuing after the acquisition. In one
case, a U.S.-based issuer was charged with books and records
and internal controls violations for continuing a kickback
scheme originated by its predecessor.’ Another recent case
involved a merger between two tobacco leaf merchants,
where prior to the merger each company committed
FCPA violations through its foreign subsidiaries, involving
multiple countries over the course of many years. At each
company, the bribes were directed by the parent company’s
senior management. The two issuers then merged to form
a new public company. Under these circumstances—the

Cannabis Plant Terpene Profile

Myrcene is the most abundant terpene found in many cannabis strains, and other terpenes are gen-
erally present in lesser, varying amounts. The following chart shows the terpene levels (percentage by

weight) found in the flower of a typical strain of cannabis.

The “Entourage Effect”

The cannabis industry is currently focused on identifying and producing customized formulations of
cannabinoids and terpenes that may effectively target specific health conditions or otherwise cause an
intended, desirable effect on users. Cannabis strains with specific THC to CBD ratios are currently
the predominant focus for therapeutic applications. THC to CBD ratios in strains popular for treating
certain medical conditions generally range from 100:1 through 1:100, as illustrated by the following
chart.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014475.txt,"Politics — populism in the Eurozone?

Few predicted that the UK would vote to leave the EU and Donald Trump would win the
US presidential election in 2016, least of all pollsters (and many in markets). As Michael
Hartnett argues, the rise of populism can be linked to what he refers to as Peak
Inequality and Peak Globalisation. Trump and the Brexit campaign tapped into deep
apathy with the socio-economic order that for them remains unreformed post-GFC.
That’s why the poster boy for this dislocation is often the blue collar voter whose
standards of living have not been rising in the increasingly globalised world. The crucial
question for investors as we enter a busy year for European politics (see table opposite}
is whether the populism train will gather pace or terminate at the Eurozone.

Italy risks elevated, but risks two way and banks the bigger issue

Although Italy goes to the polls this year, it is worthwhile starting with this Sunday’s
vote. In Strategy Insights: Italy risks elevated we argue that our base case is a narrow
rejection of the proposed constitutional reform, which is another vote against governing
party on Dec 4. But unlike UK/ US, this would be expected and Renzi is likely to stay on
so the outcome should not carry the same surprise or uncertainty factor for markets.
The tail risk are also two way. A large “No” vote could perceived as supportive of the 5
star movement but a “Yes” vote would be bullish Italy and risk assets more generally.
The bigger issue is likely recapitalisation of the Italian banks. This remains a significant
tail risk for banks and was part of why we downgraded the sector.

A Le Pen victory could prove the biggest risk to European markets in 2017
Probably the most natural fit for the populism theme in 2017 is the French presidential
election. Although polls have been somewhat discredited by events this year they
remain useful as an indication of where the public mood lies. With that caveat in mind,
current voting intentions suggests Front National leader Marine Le Pen will receive
enough votes to progress to the second round and is likely to be joined by Republican
candidate Francois Fillon. Although when Fillon and Le Pen are polled together in a
second round runoff Fillon is ahead by ~65%-35%, Le Pen is seen as capable of
appealing to the same anti-establishment / blue collar voters as Trump/ Brexit.

Investors’ biggest concerns are that we could see the same narrowing of polls in favour
of Le Pen into the election months as we saw in the UK/US. We think this could mean
French political risk becomes a major overhang for European equities in H1 2017. The
worry is that a Le Pen Presidency could bring the future of the EU and the Euro into
question as she has talked about France withdrawing from both and is especially an
issue because of the winner takes it all nature of French presidential elections. As James

didn’t need to. Sources say she found another rich man as Epstein
whiled away his hours in and out of the Palm Beach Stockade.
She reinvented herself, and when her relationship with the
wealthy man fell apart, she played the field until she met and
married a race-car driver named Brian Vickers. Along the way
she reinvented herself yet again, changing her name to Sarah

Kensington.

Nadia Marcinkova changed her surname to Marcinko and, after
training at a Palm Beach flight school, became a commercial
pilot and certified flight instructor. Calling herself Gulfstream
Girl on Facebook, she cultivated her social media presence until
2013, when the Gulfstream company filed a trademark infringe-
ment lawsuit against her. When the suit was settled out of court,
in 2014, Marcinko changed “Gulfstream” to “Global.”

“As a child.” she wrote for the “About Me” page on her web-
site, “Nadia channeled her entrepreneurial spirit by selling invi-
sible pets to neighboring kids. She continued on to manage a
successful family marketing business and soon she was disco-
vered by a modeling agency and immersed into the marketing
and advertising world as a spokesperson and international fash-

ion model.”

Can Alts Unlock Value with
C-Corp Conversions ?

e think APO could unlock the most value by converting to a C-corp

with 26% in our upside case vs. -14% in our downside case. ARES

could be the first to convert, but this is largely priced in. These

Brokers & Asset Managers

firms have more sticky management fee-related earnings @ North america industry View

vs. BX/CG/KKR that may see less benefit.

We believe ARES could be the first Alt stock to convert; we
would view that as a positive catalyst for the group that, if suc-
cessful, could lead others to follow. ARES reports 4Q earnings on
February 15, and we expect a potential announcement or indications
of mgmt@ intentions and/or timing. C-corp conversion has domi-
nated our conversations with investors of late with increased
inbound questions including interest from some new to the Alts. As
a result, in this report we expand on prior work here, and here, cre-
ating a C-corp conversion scorecard with qualitative pros/cons for
each company. We also evaluate the potential valuation impact if
Alts convert, and we take a deep dive into how the market might
value two earnings components ina C-corp structure: )) sticky, recur-

ring management fee-related earnings and 2) performance fees.

We see an opportunity for Alts to unlock value by shedding the
partnership structure and converting to C-corps. Changing from
a partnership structure could help alleviate the complexities of cur-
rent K-1 tax reporting and expand the universe of eligible investors in
the Alts. Some investors today are restricted from investing in lim-
ited partnerships, while others don®want the operational and tax

complexities of investing in a partnership structure.

Management fee-related earnings could re-rate higher toward
22.5xin our upside case, as we look at three different approaches
for valuing this sticky earnings stream: 1) traditional asset man-
ager comps vs. organic growth, 2) publicly traded C-corp Alts comps,
and 3) an approach looking at FRE as bond yield proxy with a credit

spread, to determinate an appropriate cap rate.

In-Line

Performance fees appear cheap (at 6.1x) if management fees
re-rate to 22.5x in the context of Alts converting to C-corps anda
24% overall tax rate. This suggests the market is misvaluing perform-
ance fees, and we could also see Alts performance fee earnings

re-rate higher if C-corp conversion expanded the investor base.

We see companies that have a greater skew to management fees
as best positioned for conversion, as we see the greatest potential
for multiple expansion on for this portion of the earnings. For stocks
under coverage, we see APO as potentially being able to unlock
the most value, with near-term upside to current prices of 26%,
if the shares re-rate. We see ARES as another winner from conver-
sion but the we belive this is priced with shares up 23.5% YTD. Our
analysis suggests a less favorable upside/downside scenario for con-
version for companies under coverage with lower taxes and/or

greater exposure to performance fees (KKR, CG, BX).

into what it seeks? The leap from deciding liver allocations to shutting down liquor
plants might seem pretty short to a rationalizing machine. And if such a machine
could really “think”, Vinge bet it would pretty quickly conclude that the restraints of
its creators were limiting what it had been asked to do. At which point the AI would
turn to thinking about how to escape those bounds. It would be like Deep Blue
programmed to plan its own prison break. And as much as humans might try to
stifle a smart machine, we’d be fighting to contain something more powerful than
we'd ever encountered.

This challenge, which sounds like something out of science fiction, is known by
technologists by a name that does sound like a short story by Isaac Asimov: “The
Confinement Problem”. The computer scientist Butler Lampson named this in 1973
as a sort of task for computer security experts - possibly their last. The assignment:
Not simply to keep malware out of a system, but to keep the mind of a malicious
machine inside. To gate it. Today computer science labs are filled with nervous,
apocalyptic research imagining the impossible troubles of confinement. The debate
divides those who think smart technology can be contained - “Boxers,” they are
called - and those like Vinge who think the AI will always, eventually escape.
“Imagine yourself confined to your house with only limited data access to the
outside, to your master.” he wrote, putting the reader in the place of an AI machine.
“If those masters thought ata rate -- say - one million times slower than you, there
is little doubt that over a period of years (your time) you could come up with
‘helpful advice’ that would incidentally set you free.”

Imagine you are in charge of containing that health-optimizing AI. What if it told you
it had the power to cure all illness and hunger, to ameliorate the misery of the world,
if only it could be permitted to really control access to all the world’s trading and
transport market? Let me out! Would you refuse?2°8 Would that be ethical?
Eventually, perhaps, the Al would study the physics of its own electrics, discover
laws no human knows, and then slip free from its box on a trail of bits we’d never
imagined, using physical laws we'll never discover. Impossible? “It seems to me that
historically ‘impossible’ has essentially always meant ‘I can’t figure out how to do it
right now,” the computer scientist Michael Vassar has written about such a situation.
“People proposing AI boxes are a bit like literature majors proposing to

lock McGuyver in a ‘room full of discarded electronics components.’”26? The
computers, built to solve problems, will do exactly that. This is perhaps why some of
the bleakest warnings about AI come from the very New Caste figures now
accelerating their adoption. Al is our “biggest existential threat” they warn, even as
they integrate it more fully into their own products.

Commodities -— Key points

36 UBS

Broadly diversified commodity indices, which declined by about 10% in May, found some support in
June. The sideways move was visible across all commodity sectors, with gold (precious metals)
delivering a temporary price uptick after the May US nonfarm payroll release.

Despite signs of price stabilization, diversified commodity indices are likely to decline in the
coming weeks. Sluggish economic activity should put upward pressure on most commodity
inventories. To mitigate inventory buildups, lower prices are required, in our view. Production cuts for
cyclical commodities need to be incentivized, while demand needs a push.

The starting point for gold (precious metals) remains challenging, with supply likely to outpace
demand this year. However, the chance of further monetary easing (QE3) by the Fed - which is not our
base case - is an upside risk to the gold price. Given the weak fundamental situation combined with
the substantial QE3 risk we maintain our neutral position.

Easing geopolitical tensions related to Iran and further inventory builds in crude oil shifted the
market's attention to sluggish demand growth. With muted incremental crude oil consumption, crude
oil prices are likely to remain under pressure. But as production cuts are likely to kick in, downward
price momentum should slow meaningfully. OPEC production cuts of up to 0.5 mbpd are needed in
the coming months, and should allow the Brent price to stabilize in the USD 80.5 - 90/bbl range (WTI
with a USD 12/bbl discount). But a sideways move in crude oil is not good enough to be long the
commodity. The Brent forward curve has joined WTI and moved into contango as well. Hence, we
keep our underweight position.

With regards to base metals, prices have room to soften in the very short run (4-6 weeks). Copper
prices are likely to decline to USD 6,600/mt in order to weigh on scrap supply and compensate for
deteriorating Chinese import volumes. But the price decline in copper and other base metals should be
short lived. Fiscal and monetary easing in China provide the basis for an acceleration in base metal
demand and should keep prices largely flat on a 6-month horizon. Moreover, metals like aluminum
and nickel are already trading deeply into the production cost curve, which we regard as
unsustainable over the long run. We keep a neutral position on base metals until we see further
confirmation of a pickup in Chinese economic activity.

The outlook for ample supply in agricultural commodities, especially for corn, should still weigh on
the grain complex towards the end of the year. Some short-term price support from dry US Midwest
weather conditions in recent weeks is not altering our negative stance. Soft commodities are also
battling with higher inventories, which will not bode well for prices in 3Q 2012.

supplements, regardless of whether the substances are hemp-derived. This is because
both CBD and THC are active ingredients in FDA-approved drugs and were the subject
of substantial clinical investigations before they were marketed as foods or dietary
supplements. Under the FD&C Act, it’s illegal to introduce drug ingredients like these
into the food supply, or to market them as dietary supplements. This is a requirement
that we apply across the board to food products that contain substances that are active
ingredients in any drug.

In response to Gottlieb’s statement, Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.)
sent a letter to the FDA on Jan. 15 urging the agency to update federal regulations
governing the use and interstate sale of certain hemp-derived ingredients in food,
beverages or dietary supplements. The two senators, who authored the 2018 Farm Bill’s
Hemp Farming Act provision, indicated that it was “Congress’ intent to ensure that both
U.S. producers and consumers have access to a full range of hemp-derived products,
including hemp-derived cannabinoids.” They requested feedback from FDA within 30
days on the agency’s specific plans regarding implementation of the 2018 Farm Bill.

Notable State-Level Events
California

California has historically been more aligned with the FDA's stance that industrial hemp-
derived CBD cannot be used in food or dietary supplements. However, that state does
permit the sale of food products with cannabis-derived CBD in licensed dispensaries.
The Food and Drug Branch of California Department of Public Health (CDPH) issued an
updated FAQ on CBD in food products in July 2018 indicating that its definition of “food”
does not include cannabis products like edibles, which are legal in California. CDPH also
technically bans the sale of CBD oil outside of licensed cannabis retailers, though it isn’t
always enforced.

Separately, California Governor Jerry Brown signed a law in late September 2018
(Assembly Bill 2914) that bans the addition of CBD or THC to any cocktail at a public
establishment. The new law “prohibit[s] an alcoholic beverage licensee from, at its
licensed premises, selling, offering, or providing cannabis or cannabis products, including
an alcoholic beverage that contains cannabis or cannabis products, and would provide
that no alcoholic beverage shall be manufactured, sold, or offered for sale if it contains
tetrahydrocannabinol or cannabinoids, regardless of source.”

value to Chinese government officials.”

Companies also may violate the FCPA if they give
payments or gifts to third parties, like an official's family
members, as an indirect way of corruptly influencing a for-
eign official. For example, one defendant paid personal bills
and provided airline tickets to a cousin and close friend of
the foreign official whose influence the defendant sought in
obtaining contracts.'© The defendant was convicted at trial
and received a prison sentence.’

As part of an effective compliance program, a com-
pany should have clear and easily accessible guidelines
and processes in place for gift-giving by the company’s
directors, officers, employees, and agents. Though not
necessarily appropriate for every business, many larger
companies have automated gift-giving clearance pro-
cesses and have set clear monetary thresholds for gifts
along with annual limitations, with limited exceptions
for gifts approved by appropriate management. Clear
guidelines and processes can be an effective and efficient
means for controlling gift-giving, deterring improper
gifts, and protecting corporate assets.

The FCPA does not prohibit gift-giving. Rather, just
like its domestic bribery counterparts, the FCPA prohibits
the payments of bribes, including those disguised as gifts.

Charitable Contributions

Companies often engage in charitable giving as part
of legitimate local outreach. The FCPA does not prohibit
charitable contributions or prevent corporations from act-
ing as good corporate citizens. Companies, however, can-
not use the pretense of charitable contributions as a way to

funnel bribes to government officials.

Lawsuit documents link Jeffrey Epstein to
modeling agency owner Jean Luc Brunel

By Michele Dargan

Daily News Staff Writer

New court filings in a civil case filed by billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein link Epstein and
Jean Luc Brunel, owner of modeling agency MC2.

The documents say MC2 employees told attorney Brad Edwards that Epstein’s condos at 301 E.
66th St. in New York City were used to house young models.

Edwards, who has sued Epstein on behalf of several women claiming to be victims of sex abuse
by Epstein, was told MC2 brought underage girls in from all over the world, promising them
modeling contracts,

“Epstein and Brunel would then obtain a visa for these girls, then would charge the underage
girls rent,” the documents say.

Through the investigation of his lawsuits against Epstein, Edwards learned Brunel “runs the
modeling agency MC2, a company for which Epstein provides financial support,” the documents
say.

They also allege Epstein tried to thwart Edwards from taking depositions of Brunel, Epstein’s
companion Guislaine Maxwell, and other high-profile names such as President Bill Clinton.

Details are listed in more than 62 pages filed by attorney Jack Scarola on behalf of Edwards in
the lawsuit Epstein filed against Edwards. Edwards represents four of Epstein’s minor victims,

three of whom have settled their cases with Epstein under a confidential agreement.

Epstein attorneys Christopher Knight and Joseph Ackerman declined to comment Friday on the
court filings.

Edwards deposed Brunel, but his attorney delayed it and then said he was back in France with no
plans to return. But according to the court papers, Brunel was staying with Epstein in Palm
Beach during that period.

I've got a story idea for you. The rebuilding of Indonesia. Or New Orleans. Or both. Go there. I've just been. You will never 
think the same way about anything again. 
So spoke not Bill or Melinda Gates, but Ghislaine Maxwell, the 48-year-old woman being written up everywhere at the moment 
as the alleged procurer of young women for billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. 
Epstein, 57, is the financier who spent a year in jail on charges of soliciting prostitutes—and now there is talk of another 
investigation because various women, now in their twenties and thirties, have come forward with allegations that he molested 
them when they were under-age. The allegations first surfaced in British newspapers, which have zeroed in on Epstein's 
friendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tried to publicly disassociate himself from his old pal. 
I wrote a piece for Vanity Fair in 2003 called The Talented Mr. Epstein. It was largely a business piece that focused on his 
mysterious exit from Bear Stearns in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne, Les Wexner, the chairman of Limited 
Brands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude Hoffenberg, who is currently serving a 20-year-jail 
sentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of $450 million. 
The piece alluded to Epstein's great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women with whom he had 
sexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn't really go there, focusing instead on the issue that remains a mystery—how 
Jeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers. 
This is not to say I didn't hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I concentrated on the intriguing 
financial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same ones, different ones. And their stories are bone-
chilling. Journalists from England have phoned—and, in one case, flown—to ask me about Epstein and Maxwell. Who is he? 
And the British, especially, want to know: Who is she? At this point, I am so bored of repeating myself to others—it was, after all, 
my 2003 Vanity Fairstory that really brought him into the limelight—that I have decided to write about this myself. 
Bizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to know Jeffrey and Ghislaine far better after my piece than before it. I kept running into both of 
them, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of young women with him who stand two 
feet behind him, as if serving a monarch. Do they speak? I remember asking him once, nodding at his lookalike blondes. He 
laughed. Not like you, Vicky, was his riposte. 
I remembered that when we'd once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I hadn't studied math 
since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a package at home via messenger. It was a 
book: Math for idiots. 
So he is not without humor, even though he doesn't drink or smoke, and hates restaurants. 
Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects, newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He was certainly 
preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few moments in his company and 
you know this to be true. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030462 
When I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that Andy—as 
Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his strange title is. Because if one 
thing's for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what he's talking about far more than Andy does. 
Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other financiers hang out with him. 
And Ghislaine? 
Full disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It's almost impossible not to. 
She is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I've spent hours talking to her about 
the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is curious. She has spent weeks at the bottom 
of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent me a DVD of the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away 
almost anyone else's I can think of—probably even Rupert Murdochs'. She is very well-read and can talk about most things for 
hours. She is passionate about Bill Clinton with whom she is close friends. 
Yet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-Platero, (known 
fondly to her close friends as the Tennis Goddess) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When it comes down to things she 
really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her vulnerability. 
And that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey. 
He saved her, I remember a close friend of mine telling me. When her father died, she was a wreck; inconsolable. And then 
Jeffrey took her in. She's never forgotten that—and never will. 
In many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect replacement for her 
father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his sexual pecadillos, but then Ghislaine's 
father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving a massive black hole he'd fraudulently created. To 
Ghislaine, Jeffrey's habits may not have seemed that strange. 
In fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful people in the end 
either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl issues, and moved countries to avoid 
paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You don't tend to get to the top by being the world's most 
balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett didn't quite manage a normal life—whatever that is. He had a second 
wife for many years whose existence he has been open about. 
So what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven't spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her loyalty to friends 
like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about as always. Look at Waksal and Stewart. No one 
sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up for all sorts of blemishes.

Company _ Contracts

Dallah Dallah has had two types of hospital contracts.
One, which just involves management expertise, was worth SAR4.5m over five years and 10% of the
hospitals income.
The other was worth SAR89m over five years but in this Dallah was responsible for all staffing and
supplies and infrastructure operation and maintenance.

Mouwasat Mouwasat managed Najd consulting hospital in Riyadh in return for management fees of c.SAR3m per
year; this was subsequently changed to receiving a share of revenues and net profits.

NMC NMC was awarded a contract to manage a government hospital in Umm Al Quwain, UAE. The five year
contract sees it earn $5m (SAR18m) in fees per year, subject to certain performance criteria being met.
During the term of the contract NMC is to train government staff to which it will hand over administration
at expiration.

Source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, company report

Private groups may lack capacity to undertake such contracts

The private hospital groups in Saudi Arabia are small. Habib Medical Group, Mouwasat
and Middle Eastern Healthcare group are the largest, with only 8, 5 and 4 hospitals
respectively. We would question whether any company has the depth of management to
undertake management of a large number of government hospitals. Potentially the
government could seek to import foreign expertise.

Insurance roll-out likely to boost private volumes

Longer-term, the roll-out of private insurance would likely have a positive impact on
volumes available for incumbent operators to capture. This will depend though on the
available capacity of private operators at that time and level at which reimbursement is
set. The current listed operators typically target high income patients and a lot of the
growth in volumes would likely be in the low-to-middle income spectrum.

Cultural shift would be needed to target larger population at lower price point

It would require a clear cultural shift for the incumbent listed hospital operators to
switch from offering a high quality service to high income individuals to operating
facilities that served the wider population at what we presume would be a much lower
price point.

Investment is difficult until pricing and reimbursement is clarified
Until reimbursement levels are clarified, existing private operators/investors will not be
able to make decisions on investing in private healthcare facilities.

Privatisations seem unlikely in the near-term

Given the stated intention to improve the quality of hospitals prior to privatisations, it
seems unlikely there will be any near-term, although the NTP does call for privatisation
of one of the medical cities in a public-private partnership. Saudi operates a number of
medical cities, which are typically collections of hospitals that act as tertiary referral
centres. The largest of these is the King Fahad medical city in Riyadh, with 1,095 beds.
It is uncertain which city is planned for privatisation. As with further investment by
private operators in new facilities, the level of reimbursement would need to be clarified
so potential bidders can estimate their return on investment from participating.

270 public hospitals in Saudi currently

Latest available data (2014) from the Saudi Ministry of Health discloses 270 public
hospitals with 40,300 beds. Of these, 47 hospitals are in Riyadh, with 25% of the
population, and 13 hospitals are in Jeddah, which holds 14% of the population.
Presumably these assets would be the most valuable during a privatisation process, not
only because of the population sizes, but also because the provision of beds hasn’t kept
up with population growth, ensuring high demand. Both areas also host the highest
number of private hospitals in the country.

Snowden’s supporters, to be sure, disputed this view. If only as an act of faith in Snowden’s
personal integrity, they continued to believe his avowal to Senator Humphrey that he had acted
to protect U.S. secrets by shielding them from adversary intelligence services after he took them
abroad. They also continued to take him at his word when he said he had destroyed all the NSA
documents before going to Russia. Despite such protestation of Patriotic loyalty, U.S intelligence
officials could not so easily dismiss the possibility that the missing documents still existed. After
all, a U.S intelligence worker who is dedicated to protecting American secrets from its
adversaries does not ordinarily takes them to an adversary country. The NSA, CIA and
Department of Defense therefore had little choice but to assume the worst had happened: Russia
and China had obtained access to the “keys of the kingdom”. Whatever the extent of the actual
damage, it was up to General Alexander’s replacement, Admiral Michael Rogers, both to restore
morale and rebuilding the capabilities of America’s electronic intelligence in the wake of the
massive breach. According to a National Security staff member in the Obama White House, that
job would take more than a decade. Meanwhile, Whoever now held the keys to the kingdom,
one thing was certain: the NSA had failed to protect them. This intelligence failure did not happen
out of the blue. Meanwhile, Putin added insult to the injury by awarding the alleged perpetrator
sanctuary in Russia.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019419.txt,"published today in Nature Physics, is that spatial networks are necessarily dependent on any number of critical nodes
whose failure can lead to abrupt — and unpredictable — collapse1.

The electric grid, which operates as a series of networks that are defined by geography, is a prime example, says Havlin.
“Whenever you have such dependencies in the system, failure in one place leads to failure in another place, which
cascades into collapse.”

The warning comes ten years after a blackout that crippled parts of the midwest and northeastern United States and parts of
Canada. In that case, a series of errors resulted in the loss of three transmission lines in Ohio over the course of about an
hour. Once the third line went down, the outage cascaded towards the coast, cutting power to some 50 million people.
Havlin says that this outage is an example of the inherent instability his study describes, but others question whether the
team’s conclusions can really be extrapolated to the real world.

“| suppose | should be open-minded to new research, but I'm not convinced,” says Jeff Dagle, an electrical engineer at the
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Washington, who served on the government task force that investigated
the 2003 outage. “The problem is that this doesn’t reflect the physics of how the power grid operates.”

Critical order

Havlin and his colleagues focused on idealized scenarios. They found that randomly structured networks — such as social
networks — degrade slowly as nodes are removed, which in the real world might mean there is time to diagnose and
address a problem before a system collapses. By contrast, the connections of orderly lattice structures have more critical
nodes, which increase the instability. The problem is that such orderly networks are always operating near an indefinable
edge, Havlin says. To reduce that risk, he recommends adding a small number of longer transmission lines that provide
short cuts to different parts of the grid.

Benjamin Carreras, a physicist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee who has conducted similar work2, says that
network theory can be useful for providing insight into electric grids but must be complemented with more complex models
that attempt to represent both the physical realities and the responsiveness of the modern electric grid. Although in some
cases adding long lines can benefit the overall stability of an electric system, Carreras’ work suggests that in certain
circumstances such an approach allows problems to propagate even farther.

“More connections may stabilize some processes, by, for instance, increasing the number of paths to generators, but also
may destabilize others,” Carreras says. “One cannot make generic statements on this topic.”

Although local outages caused by falling trees knocking down distribution lines are common, large-scale failures within the
core ne transmission lines rarely occur ona modern electric grid. Before 2003, the last major blackout in the United States
had been on the west coast in 1996, and more recently an outage has struck in the San Diego area.

Dagle says that the 2003 blackout stemmed from a combination of bad vegetation management — the first three lines
tripped after sagging into trees but were all within their load rating — and a series of monitoring and communications
breakdowns. Vegetation requirements have since been standardized, and a new generation of sensors is providing grid
operators with more information about what is happening across the grid at any given moment.

“Many more utilities have much more data,” Dagle says. “The next phase of our voyage is to make better use of that data.”

4.4.1.1 Neural-Symbolic Integration

The distinction between neural and symbolic systems has gotten fuzzier and fuzzier in recent
years, with developments such as

e Logic-based systems being used to control embodied agents (hence using logical terms to
deal with data that is apparently perception or actuation-oriented in nature, rather than
being symbolic in the semiotic sense), see [SSO3a] and [GMIT08].

e Hybrid systems combining neural net and logical parts, or using logical or neural net com-
ponents interchangeably in the same role [L Aon].

e Neural net systems being used for strongly symbolic tasks such as automated grammar
learning ([Elm91], [Elm91], plus more recent work.)

Figure 4.7 presents a schematic diagram of a generic neural-symbolic system, generalizing
from [BI05], a paper that gives an elegant categorization of neural-symbolic AI systems. Figure
4.8 depicts several broad categories of neural-symbolic architecture.

Fig. 4.7: Generic neural-symbolic architecture

Bader and Hitzler categorize neural-symbolic systems according to three orthogonal axes:
interrelation, language and usage. “Language” refers to the type of language used in the symbolic
component, which may be logical, automata-based, formal grammar-based, etc. “Usage” refers
to the purpose to which the neural-symbolic interrelation is put. We tend to use “learning” as
an encompassing term for all forms of ongoing knowledge-creation, whereas Bader and Hitzler
distinguish learning from reasoning.

Of Bader and Hitzler’s three axes the one that interests us most here is “interrelation”, which
refers to the way the neural and symbolic components of the architecture intersect with each
other. They distinguish “hybrid” architectures which contain separate but equal, interacting
neural and symbolic components; versus “integrative” architectures in which the symbolic com-
ponent essentially rides piggyback on the neural component, extracting information from it and
helping it carry out its learning, but playing a clearly derived and secondary role. We prefer
Sun’s (2001) term “monolithic” to Bader and Hitzler’s “integrative” to describe this type of
system, as the latter term seems best preserved in its broader meaning.

¢ Four tail risks for 2017: 1) US deregulation, 2) EZ risk premia rises; 3) weaker bulk

« Position for normalization of swap spreads; 30s50s BTP flattener; long EUR/HUF
vol; long AUD/USD digital puts; 1y10s20s conditional bear steepener in Japan.

There are three key lessons on tail risks from 2016: 1) tail-risk probabilities are generally
“fatter” than commonly assumed (Brexit and Trump’s victory); 2} hedging tail risks even
in a world of low implied volatilies is hard if the directional implications are unclear
(equity puts for a Trump victory); 3) investors worry about tail risks closer to the events
— Chart 72 shows the biggest perceived tail risks, according to our Fund Manager
Survey, were either during the event itself (China recession worries alongside capital
outflows) or at most a few months in advance (Brexit and the US election).

Looking ahead to 2017, we believe tail-risk hedging will be more important than ever,
but that investors should be sufficiently forward looking and focus on those where there
is clarity about the directional implications. We highlight four such opportunities in this
section, specifically: 1) US deregulation; 2) return of Euro zone risk premia; 3) China-
linked commodity prices weakening sharply; and 4) Japan’s yield curve targeting
triggering a steeper curve and volatility increase.

be to expand government ownership of the means of production.

“They have nationalized the health care industry pretty extensively. They’ve done that with home building as
well. They’ ve tried it with the auto industry as well. So they have moved very, very deliberatively and

purposefully toward extending the government ownership of the means of production.

“That to me, if you read the tealeaves, is what they are doing. It is not what they are saying they are doing, but
that is what they actually are doing.

“People don’t work to pay taxes, people work to get what they can after taxes. It’s that very private incentive
that motivates them to work. If you pay people not to work and tax them if they do work, don’t be surprised if

you find a lot of people not working.”

Laffer said the current economic woes started to form under President George W. Bush but have been made
worse by Obama’s policies.

“There’s a wedge driven between wages paid and wages received and that wedge is the tax/government
spending wedge,” he said.

“That wedge has grown dramatically in the last 4 % years...under W and a Republican administration
and...under Obama. Bipartisan ignorance has led us to this very disastrously desolate state.”

Laffer had high praise for the role the tea party has played in bringing the problem of the deficits to the fore.

“The tea party is not the problem, the tea party may well be the solution,” he said. “They are critical to the
future of the country in a positive way. They are the only fiscally sound people I know out there all the time.

“T don’t know that I would go as far as they go on a lot of issues but I surely respect their movement very
much.”

And he said any one of the group of Republicans vying for the party’s nomination for the White House would
make “a great president.”

“Tim Pawlenty is spectacular. Newt Gingrich knows more about issues than anyone you’ ve ever seen. Michele
Bachmann is out-of-sight wonderful,” he said.

“Rick Perry is second to no one in this stuff. If you look at Herman Cain, he’s phenomenal.

“Oh and (Jon) Huntsman was a great governor of the state of Utah and is a phenomenally experienced
intellectual competent man.

Carry trades and blond swans

¢ We do not expect traditional carry trades such as ARS and BRL to perform well ina
strong USD and increasing interest rates environment, so we focus on USD neutral
carry trades.

¢ We like short EUR/RUB, short SGD/INR and long PEN/CLP. For more neutral
commodity exposure we like baskets of EUR, CAD, COP and CLP, AUD to fund RUB
and PEN trades respectively.

Carry is in the eye of the beholder

To focus on identifying best carry trades in the current environment of rising US
interest rates sounds counterintuitive at least. It is well know that carry trades perform
nicely in risk-on periods as well as in a low volatility environment, which is the opposite
of what we expect in the coming months. However, once proper factor exposure of
currency returns is considered, smart carry reemerges as an interesting proposition. As
we have documented (Forecasting with Compass30), most of the variation in currency
returns can be explained by the first two principal components, which can be labeled as
dollar and carry factor respectively, as they are highly correlated with USD and carry
performance.

Expected returns of carry strategies are defined by interest rate differentials (ie, carry),
assuming no change in spot exchange rates. Uncovered interest parity states that the
carry should be offset by a change in the spot of equal magnitude. However, empirical
evidence (so called forward premium puzzle) clearly shows that carry trades are
profitable on average, which indicates the presence of currency risk premium. Since
both dollar and carry, are priced factors, any sensible carry strategy in an environment in
which US rates are rising needs to hedge the USD exposure. This is just a necessary
though not a sufficient condition, since the carry factor is also correlated with global
measures of risk. Interestingly, post-election currency losses is not as highly correlated
with carry, indicating that carry trades were not as a strong investment theme as it was
the case during the taper tantrum episode (Chart 62).

When you smile, the gleam of your teeth obscures a
slight glow from radioactive waste. During the late
1950s and early 1960s, atmospheric testing of thermo-
nuclear weapons scattered so much radioactive car-
bon-14 into the atmosphere that 1t contaminated vir-
tually every ecosystem and human. Several thousand
unstable radiocarbon atoms explode within and among
your cells every second as their unstable nuclei under-
go spontaneous radioactive decay. Some are the natu-
ral products of cosmic rays that can turn atmospheric
nitrogen into carbon-14, while others result from the
decay of unstable mineral elements that are found in
soil. But many of them represent the echoes of ther-
monuclear airbursts from the Cold War, finding their

18

way into our water supply and meals. If they happen to
disintegrate within your DNA, they can damage your
genes. And many of them are bound up in your teeth.
Unlike most of the atoms in your body, those embed-
ded in your strong, stable tooth enamel have been with
you ever since you ingested them through your umbili-
cal cord and your infant feeding. If you were born dur-
ing the early 1960s, you have more nuclear waste in
your teeth than if you were born later, when soils and
oceans had had time to bury radioactive atoms. In fact,
forensic scientists use the proportion of bomb carbon
in tooth enamel to determine the age of unidentified
human remains.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016171.txt,"Saudi Arabia approves 100% foreign ownership rules

e Saudi Arabia’s cabinet has approved rules governing foreign ownership of retail and
wholesale businesses in the Kingdom. The regulations, which were first discussed
last year, allow foreign investors to own 100% of retail and wholesale businesses in
the country. Earlier, the ownership ceiling for foreigners was set at 75%. This
initiative is aimed at attracting more regional and international brands to Saudi
Arabia, creating more jobs, and boosting non-oil revenue. This has raised concerns
regarding the sustainability of the business model of Saudi retailers.

e Real estate is key to entering a market: unlike its peers, Al Hokair enjoys favourable
access to prime locations in well-located shopping malls owned by its parent
shareholder, Al Hokair Group. Fashion retailers such as Inditex continue to compete
for good-quality real estate in shopping centres and on high streets.

e — Jarir and Extra are more vulnerable to the entry of international retailers such as
Apple as barriers of entry are very low for consumer electronics and appliances.
Furthermore, the government emphasis on developing tourism and family
entertainments (Six Flags, Sea World) represents a potential threat to Jarir and
Extra’s business models which still play an ‘entertaining’ role in Saudi Arabia.

e — Such initiatives would result in (1) reducing the number of stores; (2) a rapid
modernization of the sector; and, (3) a significant increase in labor productivity by
adopting merchandising best practices.

Rationale for liberalization

The rationale for permitting FDI in retail trading is (1) attracting investments in
production and marketing; (2) improving the availability of such goods for the consumer;
(3) encouraging increased sourcing of goods from Saudi Arabia; and, (4) enhancing
competitiveness of Saudi enterprises through access to global designs, technologies and
management practices.

Typically, global retailers follow a 100%-ownership business model, which explains their
reluctance to establish their presence in Saudi Arabia because of the restrictive policy
environment. This has been reflected in the little amount of FDI received in the Saudi
retail sector.

However, we do not believe that such decision will provide foreign investors more ability
to have control of a company as the current ownership ceiling of 75% already allows
them to pass both ordinary and special resolutions.

Key opportunities of 100% foreign ownership initiative:
We perceive several opportunities emerging from such an initiative:

1) Capital infusion: FDI is one of the major sources of investments for a
developing country like Saudi Arabia wherein it expects investments from
multinational companies to improve economic activity, create jobs, share their
expertise, back-end infrastructure and research and development in the host
country.

2) Boost competition and dampen inflation: the entry of the many multinational
corporations will promise intense competition between the different
companies offering their brands in a particular product market. This will result
in availability of many varieties, reduced prices, and convenient distribution of
the marketing offers.

3) Improvement of supply chain: Improvement of supply chain/distribution
efficiencies, coupled with capacity building and introduction of modern
technology will help arrest wastages, particularly in the food supply chain.

application of supervised learning algorithms such as recurrent neural networks. These cluster-
ing and prediction processes occur separately in each node, but the nodes are linked together
via bidirectional dynamics: each node feeds input to its parents, and receives advice from its
parents that is used to condition its probability calculations in a contextual way.

These processes are executed formally by the following basic belief update rule, which governs
the learning process and is identical for every node in the architecture. The belief state is a
probability mass function over the sequences of stimuli that the nodes learns to represent.
Consequently, each node is allocated a predefined number of state variables each denoting a
dynamic pattern, or sequence, that is autonomously learned. The DeSTIN update rule maps
the current observation (o), belief state (b), and the belief state of a higher-layer node or context
(c), to a new (updated) belief state (0’), such that

Pr(s’MN on bne)
Pr(onbne)

b’ (s’) = Pr (s’|o, b,c) = ; (4.1)

alternatively expressed as

_ Pr(ols’, b, c) Pr (s'|6, c) Pr (6, c)

(8) = Pr (06, ce) Pr (6, c} (4.2)

Under the assumption that observations depend only on the true state, or Pr(ols’, b,c) =
Pr(o|s’), we can further simplify the expression such that

__ Pr(o|s’) Pr (s’|b, c)

/ i
= A,
u (s) = Pe (43)
where Pr (s‘|b,c) = >> Pr (s‘|s,c)b(s), yielding the belief update rule

sles ses

where S denotes the sequence set (i.e. belief dimension) such that the denominator term is a
normalization factor.

One interpretation of eq. (4.4) would be that the static pattern similarity metric, Pr (o|s’),
is modulated by a construct that reflects the system dynamics, Pr (s’|s,c). As such, the belief
state inherently captures both spatial and temporal information. In our implementation, the
belief state of the parent node, c, is chosen using the selection rule

c= argmaxb,(s), 4.5
Op

where 6, is the belief distribution of the parent node.

A close look at eq. (4.4) reveals that there are two core constructs to be learned, Pr(o|s’)
and Pr(s‘|s,c). In the current DeSTIN design, the former is learned via online clustering while
the latter is learned based on experience by inductively learning a rule that predicts the next
state s’ given the prior state s and c.

The overall result is a robust framework that autonomously (i.e. with no human engineered
pre-processing of any type) learns to represent complex data patterns, and thus serves the

Regulating Modeling Agencies to Help Prevent Child Sex Trafficking

Conchita Sarnoff
Posted: 02/10/2012 8:49 pm

In 2010, Jezebel, an online site, published “The Sex Trafficking Model Scout” warning about the
dangers of deregulated modeling agencies in the U.S.

Given the growing number of modeling agencies that transport underage teenagers from foreign
countries tnto the United States and the growing sex trade of underage girls in the U.S. why does
this industry remain deregulated?

Since the advent of this business, modeling agencies have had free reign to scout teenagers from
every state in the country as well as every nation in the world. Many of these teenage girls come
from economically disadvantaged families and are offered none to very limited protection while
traveling and working as “models.”

Jezebel reported that Jean Luc Brunel, one of the cast of characters involved in the ongoing
Jetfrey Epstein (a level 3 registered sex offender), eight-year-long case, has been working for
over two decades with a succession of agencies in New York and Paris. According to media
reports, Diane Sawyer produced a segment for CBS's 60 Minutes featuring a sex scandal that
eventually led Eileen Ford (founder of renowned Ford modeling agency) to stop working with
Brunel.

Brunel's latest venture is the modeling agency MC2 based in South Beach, Fla. with satellite
offices in New York and Tel Aviv. Since his agency is deregulated and “no criminal charges

The J.P. Morgan View
Do US elections change anything?
� Asset allocation –– The equity market has priced out the Romney win scenario,
but from these levels, our economic and market outlook and risks are
unchanged. These keep us medium-term overweight equities and credit, despite
the likely volatility as the fiscal cliff is negotiated. Within equities, we stay
underweight the US, and move most of the overweight into EM Asia. We have
moved some of our credit overweight from the US to Europe.
� Economics –– The data flows continue to confirm that June/July was likely the
bottom in global activity growth, and that we are gently lifting from those
levels, even as it will take well into next year before growth returns to trend.
� Fixed Income –– Look for yields to head higher, but focus more risk on spread
compression trades.
� Equities –– We focus our overweights on EM Asia, Cyclical stocks and US
Home builders.
� Credit –– We see the current dip as an opportunity to add risk.
� Currencies –– Be long the dollar during the fiscal cliff negotiations.
� Commodities –– A further set of better Chinese economic data keeps us long
base metals.
� Equity markets are taking the Obama victory quite badly, with US stocks
down some 4% on Wednesday and Thursday. This has pushed up global bond
markets, and credit spreads are wider, but commodities are largely ignoring this
turmoil. We don’t think an Obama victory truly changes the economic outlook,
or risks, but it does eliminate the Romney hope that appeared to have been in
market pricing.
� By definition, the Romney scenario is now priced out of the market. The US
elections confirm the status quo in Washington, and to us, they do so also for
the broad economic and market outlook, from current levels. Hence, we do not
see much reason to change our investment allocations, and remain medium-term
overweight both credit and equities against cash, government debt, and
commodities. We do so on the basis of value – still high risk premia – fading
risks on fiscal policy in the US into next year; an expected rebound in global
growth; and super easy monetary policy, with more QE coming if growth were
to disappoint.
� In recent weeks, we have switched out of our long-standing US risk overweight,
into an underweight, on the argument that the US had the most committed
central banker, its growth has been least disappointing, and its fiscal risks were
further into the future. This relative risk has changed, with Chinese economic
data confirming that its economy is rebounding, while the ECB now creating a
period a relative financial “peace”. The US, in contrast, is at the start of intense
negotiations on how to avoid a fiscal-cliff induced recession next year. Neither
side of the aisle has an interest in being blamed for a recession. But markets will
still be buffeted by a steady news flow on wide gaps between each side’s
position.

As a result, we stay underweight US equities and have moved risk from our
US credit longs into Europe. Our initial US equity underweight was against
Europe and EM Asia. Our recent downgrade of Q1 growth in the Euro area
and better activity data in China made us move the lion’s share of the
overweight versus the US into EM Asia (see Wednesday’s Global Market
Outlook and Strategy).
Chinese activity data continue to surprise on the upside. October data for
IP, retail sales and fixed investment each came above our expectations. This
creates upside risk, but no change yet, to our forecasts which already assume a
gentle rise in quarterly growth rates from under 7% early this year to just
above 8% in Q1. Better data reduce the need for renewed fiscal and monetary
stimulus. The 18th Party Congress started yesterday, will last a week, and will
be followed by the announcement of the next leadership. More important for
the economic outlook will be the Annual Central Economic Working
Conference that will be held in December. We expect it to support continued
moderate fiscal policy, a neutral monetary policy, and further economic
rebalancing towards domestic consumption. It may also lower the 2013
growth target to 7%. For more details, see Haibin Zhu in today’s GDW.
Fixed Income
�
�
�
�
Bonds rallied strongly, in the slipstream of the tumbling equity market.
President Obama’s re-election perhaps also diminishes expectations of a
change in course at the Fed.
The ECB and the Bank of England stood pat at their policy meetings this
week, but the latter delivered a curveball today, announcing that its net
coupon income from QE would be transferred to the UK Treasury from next
year on. The near-term effect is a slight monetary easing, as the money will
be used to reduce the amount of gilts in issue, similar to QE itself.
Beyond that, this is another small step towards perceptions that monetary
policy is no longer independent from fiscal policy, like the Bank of Japan’s
joint statement with two government ministers last month. Nobody knows the
tipping point at which these perceptions feed into much higher inflation
expectations, just that we’ll know it when we see it.
Core euro bond yields are towards the low end of the range, and we expect
them to head higher. But we focus more risk on spread compression trades,
via overweights in Euro area peripherals, US MBS, and EM local bonds vs
DM.
Equities

Equity markets fell sharply post US elections, but we are not changing our
strategy.
From a month ago, we avoided directional longs in our GMOS model equity
portfolio due to elevated positions by spec investors (see Charts A10 and A12
in today’s Flows & Liquidity). We preferred to focus instead on regional and
sectoral trades. We stay with the same strategy focusing our
recommendations on EM Asia across regions, and Cyclical stocks and US
Home builders across sectors.
The rebound in the October global manufacturing PMI is what keeps us long

necessarily. Last summer, as equity markets rebounded in June and July,
Cyclical sectors actually underperformed. The thin grey line in the top chart
shows that Cyclical sectors have recaptured only a quarter of the
underperformance seen between March and August and thus provide a better
entry point. Position indicators suggest that investors are underweight
Cyclicals and overweight Defensives which is turn means that Defensive
sectors are more vulnerable to position unwinding.
�
We introduced an underweight in US equities in mid October to position for
the US fiscal cliff risk. Obama’s win makes it more likely that this risk will
intensify into year-end. Across regions we favor EM Asia and Europe vs. the
US. While the US is facing fiscal cliff risks, Asian equities are benefiting
from concrete signs that economic activity is rebounding in China. European
equities are benefiting from greater improvement in financial conditions,
although they are more vulnerable to noise around the Greek and Spanish
issues.
Credit
�
�
�
US credit spreads edged wider in response to the fall in equity markets
following the US elections. US HG widened 7bp to 160bp, undoing around
half of October’s peak-to-trough moves. Similar moves registered in other
USD credit markets. At 107bp, the CDX.IG is now back to early-August
levels, even as the CDS-Bond basis moved back into negative territory with
corporate bond spreads again moving above CDS.
Credit spreads may be repricing the risk of a fiscal-cliff induced recession in
2013. For context, we expect the eventual outcome of the negotiations to lead
to about 2% of GDP in fiscal contraction, not enough to tip the economy back
into recession in itself, and considerably lower than the 4% drag under the full
enactment of all revenue raising measures and spending cuts currently set to
become law on Jan 1.
From our point of view, the elections confirm the status quo both in
Washington and in market conditions – i.e. we should expect more of the
same and it has been a great year for credit. Therefore, we see the current
dip as an opportunity to add risk, and expect spreads to continue to tighten
into year end, albeit at a slower rate than in recent months. We stay down in
quality and outline in GMOS this week some relative value arguments for
Euro HY vs US HY. On that front, European credit shrugged off the election
outcome, tightening marginally in the HG space and widening very slightly in
the HY space.
Foreign Exchange
�
�
The post-US election drama is unfolding as expected. Four more years with
the same cast is delivering a higher USD versus most currencies but JPY due
to deleveraging ahead of the fiscal cliff, and lower USD/CNY forwards due to
avoidance of US-China trade conflict (see An FX guide to America’s toss-up
election, FX Markets Weekly, Nov 2). The only surprise has been that FX
volatility remains so subdued (VXY unchanged at 7.4%) in a week when the
trade-weighted dollar and equity volatility have rallied. Chalk it up to
positioning, as most indicators suggest that institutions investors entered the
US polls with aggregate USD positions close to flat.
Now, sausage-making season begins. US recession is guaranteed if the fiscal
cliff is enacted on schedule, and neither Congress nor the President welcomes

that outcome. But avoiding the worst case requires a short-term bargain plus a
long-term compromise on a scale not seen in Washington since the Clinton-
Congressional budget showdown of 1995/96. As with sausage making, this
process won’t be pleasant to watch. It would be easier to return in several
weeks when the final product is ready, but for those who cannot avoid, ignore
the likely volatility, and add to defensive trades.
Washington needs at least a month to broker deferral of a decent part of the
fiscal cliff before it can assume the monumental task of comprehensive fiscal
reform next year, and the currencies most vulnerable to an impasse are
expensive. If no grand bargain is reached before the end of the year, full
implementation of the cliff implies enough fiscal tightening to drive the dollar
up 3%-5% versus commodity currencies, given typical patterns during global
growth shocks. Even if these tax increases are reversed later in the year, the
first response would be a higher USD versus all currencies but the yen, given
how long that investors are of cyclical currencies and how short they are the
yen.

Commodities

�
Commodities are up some 1% this week, led by precious metals, which
rallied almost 4%. The strong gains in gold are probably due to the US
election result as Obama’s victory means no change to Fed policy and so
continued QE and negative real yields. Gold also tends to gain when there is
high fiscal uncertainty, just as it did last year during the acrimonious debt
ceiling debate which cost the US its AAA rating. We stay long gold.
Chinese economic data came out stronger than expected this week, providing
support for our view that Chinese economic growth has bottomed and will
rebound through next year. China’s slowing activity growth has been a major
drag on commodities over the last few years and the improving economy is
what makes us long base metals.
The expected rebound in Chinese growth does not imply that we will go back
to the double-digit growth rates that we saw before the crisis, and immediately
after. The periods when China’s economy grew at a pace above 8% coincided
with very strong price gains on commodities, as it boosted global demand.
China’s leadership is in the process of reorienting its economy towards
domestic consumption and to reduce reliance on exports and capital
investments. As a result, Chinese growth will likely settle in a 7%-8% range
over the medium term, a growth pace that in the past has not put upwards
pressure on commodity prices.

Long SX5E 2018 Index dividend futures
With our second dividend related trade, we remain long SX5E 2018 index dividend

futures (DEDZ8), a trade where we continue to see value even with the future price
trading close to the high for the year. The 2018 contract implies a 4% decline in
dividends paid from the 2016 level. In the absence of a recession, we think that is too
pessimistic — 2013 was the last year to see a material 2-year decline in dividends (in the
wake of the sovereign crisis and recession). The 2018 contract also still trades at a
discount to the level implied by our stock analysts’ DPS forecasts. Our derivative
Strategists using BofAML forecasts for 2018 estimate 8% upside from current prices.
Although the upside is now more limited the risk around this trade is also much lower
now. The pull to par effect will become the dominant driver over the coming months and
the full year results should provide clarity on where the 2018 contract will settle.

he held her head down against her will and pumped his penis inside her while she was screaming
No. See Rule 413 Notice, Exhibit “E”; Incident Report, Exhibit “A”, at 41 (specifically
discussing the rape):

“TA.H.] remembered that she climaxed and was removing herself from the

massage table. [A.H.] asked for a sheet of paper and drew the massage table in the

master bathroom and where Epstein, Marcinkova and she were. Epstein turned

[A.H.] on to her stomach on the massage bed and inserted his penis into her

vagina. [A.H.] stated Epstein began to pump. his penis in her vagina. [A.H.]

became upset over this. She said her head was being held against the bed forcibly,

as he continued to pump inside her. She screamed no, and Epstein stopped ....”

“TA.H.] advised there were times that she was so sore when she left Epstein’s

house. [A.H.] advised she was ripped, torn, in her vagina area. [A.H.] advised she

had difficulty walking to the car after leaving the house because she was so sore.”

14. Without detailing each fact known about Epstein’s abuse of the many underage
girls, Edwards has had a good faith basis to believe and did in fact believe at all relevant times
that Epstein also abused other victims in ways closely similar to those described in the preceding
paragraphs. Epstein’s additional victims include the following (among many other) young girls:
S.G.; A.D.; V.A.; N.R.; 1S; V.Z.5 J.A; FE. M.L.; M.D.; D.D.; and D.N. These girls were
between the ages of 13 and 17 when Epstein abused them. See Rule 413 Notice, Exhibit E;

good life. Parties in Vegas; weekends in the Hamptons; affairs with
beautiful women that end up getting splashed all over the tabloids.

It makes sense that, once upon a time, he and Epstein would
have gotten along.

“As for the girls,” Meister says, “that was just business. He'd
seat them strategically at client dinners. When he went to the
movies, he'd take three or four girls with him. They'd take turns
massaging his back, arms, and legs.”

According to Meister, Epstein used to boast that he “liked to
go into insane asylums because he liked to fuck crazy women.”

“Who knows if it’s true?” Meister adds. “But Tm telling you,

he used to say it.”

From time to time, Epstein’s friends and acquaintances would

see sides of Epstein that he’d grown much less shy about sharing.

Epstein encouraged Alan Dershowitz to invest with a prominent
hedge-fund managet named Orin Kramer. Dershowitz did, and he
made a lot of money at first. But in 2008, the fund Dershowitz had
invested in lost a substantial amount. Afterward, according to a for-
mer associate of Epstein’s, Epstein appeared in Kramer's midtown
Manhattan office. There, sources say, he told Kramer: “It’s very much
in your interest to make Alan Dershowitz whole.”

Epstein’s intervention worked, and Dershowitz recovered his

money.

and would have shown how he could provide potential protec-
tion from Epstein. That never happened.

39. Getting a call from this supposed FBI agent made me
scared all over again. I had left the old life of sexual slavery
behind me and started a new life in a new country in hopes
that the powerful people whose illegal activities I knew all
about would never find me.

40. Shortly after this purported FBI call, I was contacted
by telephone by someone who appeared clearly to be working
for Epstein. The caller told me about an investigation into.
Epstein and said that some of the girls being questioned were
saying that Epstein had had sexual contact with them. After
they made these allegations, the man said they were being
discredited as drug addicts and prostitutes, but in my case, if
I were to keep quiet, I would “be looked after.” The fact that
this call was made shortly after the supposed FBI call rein-
for[cled my concern that the man I had talked to earlier was
not really working for the FBI but for Epstein. I didn’t think
that the FBI and Epstein would both be working together and
would both get my phone number at almost exactly the same
time. I played along and told this person that I had gotten a
call from the “FBI” but that I didn’t tell him anything. The
person on the phone was pleased to hear [that].

41. A short time later, one of Epstein’s lawyers (not Alan
Dershowitz) called me, and then got Epstein on the line at
the same time. Epstein and his lawyer basically asked again
if I was going to say anything. The clear implication was that
I should not. The way they were talking to me, I was afraid of
what would happen if I didn’t keep quiet. My thought was

At the start of my brief remarks at the hotel podium before going to Rabin
Square, I had to call for quiet when I mentioned the phone call from Bibi. “No,” I
said, raising my voice to be heard above the boos, “we will not boo an incumbent
Prime Minister of Israel... A short time ago, I spoke with Prime Minister
Netanyahu and thanked him for his service to the State of Israel.” Then — with both
Leah and Shimon Peres at my side — I paid tribute to “that one special person who
had a unique role in our reaching this moment — somebody who was my
commander and guide, and the person who led me into politics: Yitzhak Rabin. I
pledged to fulfil his legacy, and complete the work he’d started. And I extended a
hand to “secular and religious, the ultra-Orthodox and the residents of the
settlements, to Israelis of Middle Eastern origin and Ashkenazi extraction, to
immigrants from Eithopia and the former Soviet Union, to the Arabs, the Druze,
the Circassians, the Bedouin. All, all of them, are part of the Israeli people.”

It was not long before sunrise when I reached the square. As the crowd shouted
and sang, I began with a line borrowed from Bob Shrum. It seemed particularly
apt: “It is the breaking of a new dawn,” I said.

But was it? As I paid tribute to Rabin — “in this place where our hearts broke” —
and dedicated myself to completing the work he’d begun, I could feel the
thousands in the square willing me on. Even in my more nuanced comments on the
talks with the Palestinians: the need to achieve peace, but at least for now by
disengaging rather than joining hands with the Palestinians, ensuring we had
military and border provisions to safeguard our security, and with the stipulation
that Jerusalem would remain our undivided capital, under Israeli sovereignty. But
some in the crowd were carrying posters saying ““No to the charedim” — the strictly
Orthodox. Others were chanting, in anticipation of the negotiations needed to put
together a coalition: Rak lo Shas! Anyone but Shas! It was a reference to the
Sephardi Orthodox party, which in addition to being more nuanced and flexible
than other religious parties on the issue of peace talks, had been the big winner in
the election. It had gained seven seats and now had only two fewer than the Likud.

I did not specifically mention Shas. But I said: “I tell you here that the time has
come to end divisions. The time has come to make peace among ourselves,
whether we are traditionalists or secularists... We must not be enemies of each
other.” Paying tribute to all those in the square who had worked for our election
victory, I added: “I know it would not have been possible without your support.
But I also know it would not have been possible without the support many in the

signed into law by President Obama. The
complex set of new measures targets key
industrial sectors, including shipping and
imports of products such as aluminum,
steel and coal, and seeks to block Iran
from using barter commodities such as
oil and gold to pay for imports. The
Washington Post paraphrased U.S.
officials as saying that, “the new policies
are closer to a true trade embargo,
designed to systematically attack and
undercut Iran’s major financial pillars
and threaten the country with economic
collapse.” Obama signed the National
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that
contained the sanctions provisions
despite having hinted earlier that he
might veto the NDAA over a host of
measures contained in the bill.

If the Obama administration believes that
ever-tougher sanctions will cause Iran to
cave in at the talks, it’s likely that they
are badly misreading Iranian politics.

For many observers, however, and for
Iran, too, the nomination of Hagel for
secretary of defense may be a sign that
the White House is beginning to realize
that sanctions, and threats of military
action, won’t force Iran’s hand.

neoconservatives, and members of the
pro-Israel lobby in Washington have

email concluded. “You owe me a large Scotch.”

Mr Staley, who has been heavily criticised for his attempt to unmask a whistleblower,

soon replied to the prankster in effusive terms. Presumably thinking he was talking to his
chairman, who has been dubbed “Mack the Knife” for his habit of ousting chief executives,
Mr Staley said, “You are a unique man, Mr McFarlane”.

“You came to my defense today with a courage not seen in many people. How do I thank
you?” Mr Staley wrote. The 60-year-old Barclays boss continued in the same style: “You
have a sense of what is right, and you have a sense of theatre. You mix humor with grit.
Thank you John. Never underestimate my recognition of your support. And my respect
for your guile.”

He had time for yet more praise before he signed off. “And some day I want to see an ad lib
guitar run. You have all the fearlessness of Clapton,” said Mr Staley, referencing the
legendary guitarist Eric Clapton and his chairman’s fondness for playing his guitar in
public meetings.

The brief conversation ended with a final email around 11pm. The imposter sent a poem,
which began “Worry not of tomorrow’s end” and ended “Revel in their bloodied eyes”. The
first letter of each line spelled out the word ‘Whistleblower’.

“Thanks for sharing the foxhole,” Mr Staley replied.

The prankster, who contacted the Financial Times via Twitter, told us the email was part
of his “battle with Barclays” over a customer issue. “I thought I’'d see how Jes was relaxing
after his AGM,” he said.

Barclays declined to comment.

Growing Application For Hemp And CBD Within The Apparel & Footwear
Market (Kernan)

With the changing tide on marijuana legalization and hemp cultivation, the use case for
and interest in CBD applications are rapidly expanding. We think there lies within this
fervor potential for greater utilization of hemp derived textiles in apparel, footwear and
accessories after largely being relegated to specialist brands with a few exceptions. The
Western Producer, a Western Canada weekly agriculture publication, commented that
“industrial hemp could reach whole crop utilization” in an article published on 1/10/19
“Revenue Streams Expand For Hemp Growers.” We think this compliments the
sustainability movement that is gaining ground in global apparel and footwear
production and among Millennial and Gen Z consumers. Western Producer quotes Jan
Slaski, senior researcher for InnoTech Alberta, that “textile applications have brought
[about] the development of hemp-based uniforms, socks, underwear and other
apparel...” as its properties, which Patagonia describes as “linen-like,” provide a “quality
suitable for fine textiles.”

Approximately $820MM worth of legal hemp products were sold in the U.S. in 2017 and
roughly 13% of those hemp-based products are textiles according to Entrepreneur's
9/4/18 article, “The Hemp Business ls Booming.” The article’s author Rose Leadem cites
a history of the crop dating back “to the 1600s when growing hemp was encouraged for
use in sails, ropes and clothing.” This period was followed by years of back and forth
regulation that alternately banned and unbanned hemp cultivation in the U.S. While the
2014 U.S. Farm Bill allowed for heavily restricted industrial hemp cultivation, the more
recent 2018 U.S. Farm Bill, as described by the Brookings Instituted, offers a more
“expansive” cultivation of hemp.

To frame the market opportunity for greater hemp utilization as a textile in apparel and
footwear from what is likely a nascent penetration currently, the U.S. clothing and
accessories market reached store sales of $262 billion in 2017 as reported by the U.S.
government, with potential to grow to $275B in 2018. We note that there are some
global brands that offer hemp fiber, mostly but not all ona limited basis, in their clothing
and footwear assortment. These brands include Patagonia, Columbia Sportswear’s
prAna brand, Orvis, Thought Clothing, Toad&Co, Jungmaven, Eartheasy, Sanuk, Toms,

critical role of building and maintaining a model of the state of the world. In a vision processing
context, for example, it allows for powerful unsupervised classification. If shown a variety o
real-world scenes, it will automatically form internal structures corresponding to the various
natural categories of objects shown in the scenes, such as trees, chairs, people, etc.; and also
the various natural categories of events it sees, such as reaching, pointing, falling. And, as wil
be discussed below, it can use feedback from DeSTIN’s action and critic networks to further
shape its internal world-representation based on reinforcement signals.

Benefits of DeSTIN for Perception Processing

DeSTIN’s perceptual network offers multiple key attributes that render it more powerful than
other deep machine learning approaches to sensory data processing:

1. The belief space that is formed across the layers of the perceptual network inherently
captures both spatial and temporal regularities in the data. Given that many applications
require that temporal information be discovered for robust inference, this is a key advantage
over existing schemes.

2. Spatiotemporal regularities in the observations are captured in a coherent manner (rather
than being represented via two separate mechanisms)

3. All processing is both top-down and bottom-up, and both hierarchical and heterarchical,
based on nonlinear feedback connections directing activity and modulating learning in mul-
tiple directions through DeSTIN’s cortical circuits

4, Support for multi-modal fusing is intrinsic within the framework, yielding a powerful state
inference system for real-world, partially-observable settings.

5. Each node is identical, which makes it easy to map the design to massively parallel platforms,
such as graphics processing units.

Points 2-4 in the above list describe how DeSTIN’s perceptual network displays its own
“cognitive synergy” in a way that fits naturally into the overall synergetic dynamics of the overall
CogPrime architecture. Using this cognitive synergy, DeSTIN’s perceptual network addresses
a key aspect of general intelligence: the ability to robustly infer the state of the world, with
which the system interacts, in an accurate and timely manner.

4.3.1.3 DeSTIN for Action and Control

DeSTIN’s perceptual network performs unsupervised world-modeling, which is a critical aspect
of intelligence but of course is not the whole story. DeSTIN’s action network, coupled with the
perceptual network, orchestrates actuator commands into complex movements, but also carries
out other functions that are more cognitive in nature.

For instance, people learn to distinguish between cups and bowls in part via hearing other
people describe some objects as cups and others as bowls. To emulate this kind of learning,
DeSTIN’s critic network provides positive or negative reinforcement signals based on whether
the action network has correctly identified a given object as a cup or a bowl, and this signal

Initial ideas: 
* Expand the first episode Mathematics and Truth into two or likely three episodes. I'm intrigued by this 
because there is so much rich material - pure math, philosophy (discovered or invented), physics (Wigner's 
'unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences)', astrophysics, cosmology, biology, 
general systems theory. I've felt frustrated in this first episode because there is so much material. I think three 
episodes could work - if you agree, I'll get back to you with a suggested structure of the 2 or likely 3 parts. 
Also, Closer To Truth has had only a few videos and one episode on mathematics per se (out of 277 
episodes!), so this would be original and complementary. In this may, math would become about half the

* Integrated Information Theory - quantifying and explaining consciousness (Giulio Tononi, Un

* Evolutionary Dynamics - your program at Harvard - mathematical models. This is not an area of my 
expertise, but it could well fit Closer To Truth in general and Radical Breakthroughs in particular. But you 
need to tell me if you would like to include this.

The sweeping energy, water and electricity administered price changes introduced in
December 2015 are a first step in the five-year fiscal consolidation and economic
transformation strategy. We expect further reviews of energy, water, and electricity
prices over the medium-term. Furthermore, the likely government review of current
levels of fees and fines, introduction of new fees, application of a VAT and introduction
of excise taxes on tobacco and soft drinks will also impact the Saudi consumer.

Subsidy cuts on energy and utilities to add up to 1.5ppt to CPI inflation only

We estimate the December natural gas price hike on petrochemical firms, domestic
crude oil price hike as well as the combined gasoline and diesel price hike introduced
could add USS2.2bn, US$2.0bn and USS$3.8bn to central government revenues if fully
passed to the budget (a combined 1.2% of GDP). We estimate the direct impact of these
higher gasoline, water and electricity prices to add 1.3-1.5ppt to CPI inflation due to
their low basket weights (c.1.5%, cO.4% and 1.6% respectively). We think a 5% VAT tax
could add c2% of 2015 GDP in fiscal revenues over the medium-term.

Subsidies account for 15% of Almarai’s net income; 40% are related to poultry
Almarai continues to receive subsidies from the Saudi government, amounting to
SAR295mn in 2015. This represents 15% of the Almarai’s 2015 net income. The
government pays subsidies based on price of subsidized feed importer, which means it
may increase or decrease naturally. Regarding the breakdown by business (poultry,
dairy), it is unfixed, depending on the price of feed and ingredients. As of 2015,
subsidies for poultry accounted for 40% and dairy for 60%.

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025227.txt,"helped cushion portfolio returns when markets declined. We won’t know until the data comes in, but we expect the same
to happen this time.

[5] The “Eye on the Market” has endlessly chronicled this year the fissures which are now affecting financial markets:
European sovereign risk and inadequate bank capitalization; weak labor compensation as an Achilles heel of the US
profits recovery, given its negative impact on spending; the political divide in Congress over how to deal with falling
government revenue and rising entitlement spending; inflation risks in Asia and Latin America and the resulting need for
more policy tightening; and the mixed track record of low interest rates to sustainability solve structural problems. The
cover of the 2011 Outlook (a printing press, out of control) expressed our concern regarding a recovery built upon a
stimulus machine. I would contrast this with the cover of a competitor’s 2011 publication, which had a picture of George
Washington crossing the Delaware, with the caption “America’s structural resilience, fortitude and ingenuity will carry
the economy and financial markets in 2011 —- and beyond”. Our job is not to point to where we would like the
financial markets to go, but rather to point to where they might end up. It’s like the scene in Oliver Stone’s Nixon,
when Nixon looks up at a portrait of JFK and says, “When they look at you, they see what they want to be. When they look
at me, they see what they are.” Our job is to see financial markets for what they are.

[6] All that said, we have lessons to learn here.

Too many of our investment discussions this year focused on the negative real return characteristics of
cash, and why to reduce it. In a world of deflation risk on financial assets (rather than of goods and
services), cash retains substantial option value at times like these.

We could have connected the dots more aggressively on our views on weak growth and easy monetary
policy, and owned more gold. While we have had rising price forecasts for gold and owned it in
portfolios, we did not have large enough allocations.

Given the all-time high of US government transfers to households and negative real interest rates, we
should not have interpreted positive economic data earlier this year as being highly representative of the
true run-rate of the US economy. The same goes for the global economy, which has been the beneficiary
of a lot of stimulus that is now fading, for a variety of economic and political reasons.

Great corporate profits are no guarantee against a problem in financial markets. Corporate profits and P/E
multiples were fine in June 2007, but rested on top of a systemic problem in private sector credit markets
and private sector balance sheets. This year, strong corporate profits and low P/E multiples sit on top of
systemic problems in public sector finances.

[7] In the wreckage, as usual, there are opportunities, and we will be reviewing them with you in the days ahead. There
is a benefit to having held back on our firepower this year. With risk to spend held in reserve, there are oversold assets
with considering, particularly among multinationals with strong balance sheets, high dividends and which trade at very
low multiples, something we reviewed earlier in the week.”

Oxygen: Your leafy breath

The oxygen in your lungs and bloodstream 1s a highly
reactive waste product generated by vegetation and
microbes. Trees, herbs, algae, and blue-green bacte-
ria split oxygen atoms out of water molecules during
photosynthesis. They use most of the resultant gas for
their own purposes, but thankfully some leaks out to
sustain you. In fact it makes up about a fifth of the
air you breathe. Your cells harness oxygen to release
energy from chemical bonds 1n the food you consume.

TEXT SETS

Oxygen absorbs electrons released by broken food
molecules, which attract hydrogen ions, resulting in
a molecular waste of your own making: metabolic
water, which comprises one tenth of your body fluids.
An average adult carries between 8 and 10 pounds of
homemade wastewater within them, and 1 in 10 of your
tears are the metabolic by-products of your breathing
and eating.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014767.txt,"Characterizing carry

Efficient carry strategies involve buying and selling dynamic portfolios of currencies
with certain risk characteristics. Carry strategies are supposed to work better over long
investment horizons, so that the cushion provided by the carry compensates for the
currency volatility through mean reversion.

Here, we analyze carry from a different perspective, as our goal is to identify standalone
attractive carry opportunities. We define the investment horizon to end 1Q17. We sort
currencies based on risk-adjusted carry. We then characterize the factor exposure of
currency returns, isolating global and idiosyncratic sources of risks, in order to identify
smart carry trades that are not highly exposed to a massive re-pricing of global factors,
such as US rates, USD, commodity prices and global risk aversion. We identify carry
trades that have low exposure to global factors, in particular the USD factor, and offer
attractive risk-rewards.

Not surprisingly, purely based on carry considerations, EM currencies appear more
attractive than DM ones, which are mostly candidates for funding currencies. However,
carry trades returns are highly volatile, exhibit negative skewness and fat tails. Even
controlling for different measures of risk such as volatility or maximum drawdown, and
according to this criteria only, we find that EM currencies are the most attractive, in
particular ARS, BRL in LatAm, RUB, TRY and ZAR in EEMEA and INR, IDR and CNY in
Asia (Chart 63).

Even though volatility and drawdowns can be useful measures of risk, they don’t say
much about the exposure to different risk factors. Since carry trade strategies are
usually very sensitive to global factors, we study the cross sectional exposure of
currencies to key global factors: commodity prices, global risk aversion and US yields (as
a proxy of global yields}. We report the R2 of regressions of two years of weekly returns
on the above mentioned global factors, for the last two years and the years 2013-2014
for the sake of comparison (Chart 64).

We find that currencies in LatAm and EEMEA are more exposed to global factors than in
Asia. Interestingly, LatAm and EMEA currencies are more sensitive to shocks in
commodity prices and risk aversion, while in Asia the shocks to monetary policy are the
most important ones (Chart 65). Within DM currencies, AUD and NOK are the two
currencies most exposed to global factors. Ideally, we seek for currencies with high risk-
adjusted carry and low exposure to global factors. Under such a metric, ARS, BRL, RUB
and INR stand out as the best investment currencies, while EUR, CHF, JPY, KRW and
TWD are the best funding currencies. However, this filter is not enough in the current
volatile environment.

Can you confirm if the following quote is accurate?

If anything, the unfortunate period he suffered has caused him to really think about what he wants to do
with his money and his time, and support knowledge,” says Krauss. Jeffrey has surrounded himself with
beautiful women and young women but they're not as young as the ones that were claimed. As a scientist I
always judge things on empirical evidence and he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've
never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were I would
believe him over other people. Though colleagues have criticized him over his relationship with Epstein,
Krauss insists, I don't feel tarnished in any way by my relationship with Jeffrey; I feel raised by it.”

There is also a growing market for apparel and footwear that provide recovery
attributes. For example, Under Armour has its Recovery line of apparel that includes
Celliant which is designed to “capture body heat and convert it to infrared light that is
returned to your body, boosting localized blood flow and upping the amount of oxygen
reaching your muscles.” Celliant is described as “utilizing a proprietary mineral matrix
that can be embedded into the core of a yarn or applied to a wide variety of fabrics.”
This demonstrates the ability to weave outside attributes into existing textiles to add
beneficial components beyond just providing an item of clothing. With CBD being
reported as having health and wellness properties, such as to combat inflammation,
there could be potential for CBD to be infused into textiles. Canada’s Fashion magazine
recently highlighted Devan Chemicals in its 1/4/19 article, “CBD Is Everywhere. Will
CBC-Infused Clothing Be Next?” Devan Chemicals is a Belgium-based company that has
“added CBD to their textile solutions portfolio.” The company’s “R Vital’ fabric reflects a
weave of microcapsules of CBD that release when a person wears the clothing as
demonstrated in their website’s flow chart below. While still early stage, perhaps there
will be demand for widescale CBD infused textiles, although, as the article points out, it
is unclear how the “potency” holds up over time and after washing.

Palm Beach Post Editorial 
Monday, July 07, 2008 
Two years after a grand jury indicted him on a felony charge of solicitation of prostitution, Jeffrey Epstein 
finally admitted that he lured a teenage girl to his $8.5 million, 13,000-square-foot Palm Beach mansion for 
sex. A week ago, the 55-year-old investment banker began serving 18 months in jail. 
But that plea deal - guilty of felony solicitation of prostitution and procuring a person under the age of 18 for 
prostitution - does not account for all five of the girls, one as young as 14, who alleged that Epstein sexually 
abused them. And why is Epstein serving his term in the overcrowded Palm Beach County Jail and not a state 
prison, where inmates are sent if their sentences are longer than one year? 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030311 
The slow, dissatisfying resolution of the case sends a message to the public that there's a different system of 
justice for the wealthy who hire high-powered lawyers. Epstein's legal team included West Palm Beach defense 
attorney Jack Goldberger, Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz, who defended O.J. Simpson 
against murder charges, and Kenneth Starr, the prosecutor who pursued then-President Bill Clinton for lying 
about sex with young women. 
Palm Beach police spent 11 months investigating Epstein before State Attorney Barry Krischer sent the case to 
a grand jury, instead of charging Epstein so the man who once boasted of accepting only billionaire clients 
could face a trial. The police had taken a high school transcript, class schedules and phone messages from 
Epstein's home that showed he knew the girls were underage. Yet Mr. Krischer was more swayed by Epstein's 
lawyers, who attempted to impugn the girls' character by showing they had chatted on myspace.com about 
smoking marijuana and drinking. He should have let a jury decide whether the victims - and Epstein - were 
credible. 
Ultimately, one charge against Epstein finally reflected the age of one victim, and the plea agreement left 
Epstein labeled a sex offender. With that additional charge, if Epstein had been convicted at a trial, he could 
have been sentenced to anything from probation to 15 years in prison, Assistant State Attorney Lanna 
Belohlavek said, adding that the recommended guideline sentence was 21 months. 
Epstein also won't have to certify to the court that he is receiving counseling, typically required of sex 
offenders, because he has a private psychiatrist. But without court supervision, who will ensure Epstein is in 
fact being treated? 
The plea deal also drops a federal investigation of Epstein. If a federal investigation was warranted, how does 
dropping it before completion benefit the public? 
Epstein preyed on girls and denied it. For three years, his wealth and the influence of his lawyers bought him 
the protection the state attorney owed to the victims. 
Police chief's reputation helps discredit attacks 
By Larry Keller  
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
Monday, August 14, 2006 
In the case of Palm Beach financier Jeffrey Epstein, it seems, at times, as if two men are accused of 
wrongdoing: Epstein and Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter. 
Epstein, 53, was indicted last month on a charge of felony solicitation of prostitution solely because of Reiter's 
craziness, one of Epstein's lawyers said. His department disseminated a distorted view of the case and 
behaved in a childish manner when the grand jury didn't indict Epstein on the charges it sought, another 
Epstein lawyer complained. To hear the Epstein camp tell it, Reiter, 48, is a loose cannon better suited to be the 
sheriff of Mayberry. They whisper that he's embroiled in a messy divorce. 
Reiter did in fact file for divorce from his wife, Jill, last year, after 24 years of marriage. They have a son, 18, 
and a daughter, 14. The couple is scheduled to go to mediation next week, Aug. 16. Nothing in the court file 
suggests their split is particularly ugly. 
Reiter incurred the wrath of the Epstein camp as well as the state attorney's office for two reasons. First, he 
pressed for Epstein to be charged with the more serious crimes of sexual activity with minors. Second, he 
slammed State Attorney Barry Krischer in blunt language seldom used by one law-enforcement official 
concerning another because of what he perceived as that office's mishandling of the case. 
In a letter to Krischer written May 1, Reiter called his actions in the Epstein case highly unusual. He added, 
I must urge you to... consider if good and sufficient reason exists to require your disqualification from the 
prosecution of these cases. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030312 
In short, Reiter told the county's top prosecutor for the past 13 years that he ought to get off the case. It looks 
like a departure from professionalism, Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said of 
Reiter's letter. 
Following Epstein's indictment, Reiter referred the case to the FBI to determine whether the super-rich, super-
connected defendant had violated any federal laws. 
Reiter won't discuss the case or the broadsides aimed at him. But others almost uniformly use one word to 
describe the chief: professional. 
I have always been impressed by Mike's professionalism and his leadership, said Rick Lincoln, chief of the 
Lantana Police Department and a Palm Beach County cop for 32 years. 
The town of Palm Beach has a very professional police department. We all consider Mike to be our peer and a 
man of integrity. 
Juno Beach Police Chief H.C. Clark II agreed. Although he doesn't know Reiter well, he has met with him on 
countywide law enforcement issues. I've never seen him lose his cool. I've never seen anything but a 
professional demeanor from him. 
Reiter joined the Palm Beach Police Department in 1981, leaving a $20,000-a-year patrol job at the University 
of Pittsburgh. His personnel jacket shows consistently excellent job evaluations. 
Posh Palm Beach is no hotbed of crime, and in his first year on the job, a resident confined to his home with a 
sick child thanked Reiter for delivering a few Cokes to the house. Reiter refused payment for the beverages. 
Another resident thanked Reiter for shutting off his car's headlights in his driveway, saying a valet must have 
been at fault. 
Reiter worked everything from road patrol to organized crime, vice and narcotics. And he's no novice at 
investigations involving the island's rich and famous. He was the lead detective probing the drug overdose 
death of David Kennedy in 1984. He also was one of the officers who worked the investigation of William 
Kennedy Smith, who was charged in 1991 — and later acquitted — with raping a woman at the Kennedy 
family compound in Palm Beach. 
Reiter, who has a master's degree in human resource development from Palm Beach Atlantic University, also 
has attended the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Va., and management courses at Harvard. He's been 
active in countywide interagency law enforcement organizations and has a top secret national security 
clearance. 
He has a perspective that's broader than just addressing the needs of the town, said Town Manager Peter 
Elwell, who promoted Reiter from assistant chief to chief in March 2001. Reiter makes more than $144,000 as 
the town's top cop. Elwell thinks he's worth it. 
He's very businesslike, very straightforward. He's not easily agitated or flamboyant. He's about the work, 
Elwell said. I think that his service as chief has been outstanding in five-plus years.

and positions on Iran. In conjunction with
Israel-friendly members of Congress,
they’ve warned Obama to rein Hagel in
so as not to send a dovish signal to
Tehran. Robert Satloff, executive
direction of the Washington Institute for
Near East Policy (WINEP), a pro-Israel
think tank, warned bluntly that the White
House should act quickly to make sure
that Hagel backs away from his previous
views on Iran and at least toes the
administration’s tougher line. “If the
White House does not take steps soon to
correct that impression, the chances for a
negotiated resolution of the Iran nuclear
crisis will fall nearly to zero and the
likelihood of Israeli military action will
rise dramatically,” he wrote.

Indeed, within days of his nomination as
secretary of defense, Hagel was already
backing away from his earlier views,
meeting with senior Pentagon officials
and influential senators who’ll vote on
his confirmation to clarify his views on
Iran, asserting that he supports broad
international sanctions against Iran and
that he believes that the military option
ought to be “on the table.” Several
Democratic senators who met with Hagel
announced with satisfaction that the
former senator from Nebraska had
sufficiently backtracked or “clarified” his

Nava and I voted, we attended an event for Labor supporters north of Tel Aviv,
before flying to Beersheva to spend the final hours in the Negev. I’d arranged for
Shlomo Ben-Ami to go to Kiryat Shmona in the north — emphasizing, as
throughout the campaign, our determination to broaden our support beyond
Labor’s heartland. The polls closed at 10 o’clock. I knew Bibi would be staring at
the same Channel One newscast as I was, each of us ready to put the best spin on
things, especially if there was no clear sign at this stage which one of us had won.
But the exit poll findings came as a shock: Barak, of One Israel, 58.5 percent;
Netanyahu, Likud, 41.5 percent. It was a landslide.

The full impact hit me only when I got to the fifth-floor suite in the Dan Hotel
in Tel Aviv, our election-night headquarters. My three brothers, and Nava and our
daughters, were waiting for me. Leah Rabin, too. Our eyes teared up as we
embraced. My parents were by now too frail to come. But I’d promised to phone
them, whatever happened. “We did it,” I told my father, who said mazaltov with a
depth of feeling which had become rare as his health began to fail. My mother had
always been a bit conflicted about my going into politics, despite her lifelong
belief that the isswes of politics mattered, especially after Yitzhak had been cut
down and killed for following the path on which I hoped to continue. Still, I could
hear the pride, and relief, in her voice when I said: “Remember, ima. I did promise
you that if I ran, at least I'd make sure to win.”

When we’d finished speaking, Bibi called. He had conceded publicly as soon
as the exit poll was out. He had also stunned the Likud crowd by immediately
resigning as party leader. “Congratulations,” he said, sounding, more than
anything, tired. “I accept that the voters have spoken.” I thanked him for taking the
trouble to call. I said I appreciated the contribution he’d made to the country, and
that we’d meet in the next few days to discuss how best to handle the political
transition. “Thanks,” Bibi said. “And again, mazaltov.”

By the time I got off the phone with Bibi, the TV was showing pictures of tens
of thousands of people celebrating the results in the central Tel Aviv square, now
renamed in Rabin’s memory, where he had been murdered nearly four years
earlier. Before leaving to join them, I fielded a stream of calls: from friends, other
Israeli party leaders and leaders from abroad, including Tony Blair and Bill
Clinton, both of whom not only offered warm congratulations but said they looked
forward to working with me as I tried to move Israel forward and to finish the
work Yitzhak had begun.

that. I hadn't heard Epstein’s name for years. I didn’t know
who this person was and what it was really about. I couldn’t
tell what was going on.

36. This man said he was looking into Jeffrey Epstein.
The man asked if I had been involved with Epstein. My first
instinct was to say nothing because I wasn’t sure he was
really with the FBI or any authorities. I answered a few basic
questions, telling him that I knew Jeffrey Epstein and had
met him at a young age. But the conversation didn't feel right.
This man never offered to come and meet with me in person.
Instead, he asked me right off the bat about Epstein’s sexual
practices. I thought it would be strange for a true law enforce-
ment officer to behave that way, so I became increasingly
uncomfortable and suspicious about who was actually call-
ing me.

immediately triggered all of the fears of Epstein and his pow-

would have known who I was and how I fit into Epstein’s sex-
ual crimes in many different places. He would have inter-
viewed me in a way that would have established his credentials

Long Europe equities via yield stocks & index dividends

We continue to run two yield related trades in European equities. First, we remain long a
broad selection of high yielding European equities. The dividend yield on offer in
European equities is one of the asset class’s key attractions. Europe offers a higher
dividend yield than the other regions, with a 1.1% yield pick-up versus the DM average
and 0.9% against EM equities. Those also look attractive relative to history: Europe’s
yield spread to DM ranks at the 87 percentile of the 20-year range. Europe’s DY also
looks attractive relative to sovereign and corporate bonds despite the recent sell off in
fixed income markets: the yield pick-up relative to investment grade corporates is still
289bp. Given the concerns over European politics we prefer yield based strategies in
Europe to those looking for capital appreciation at least in the short term.

That Gorgeous Underage Model May Be A
Slave: Regulation For Agencies To Stop Child
Sex Trafficking

First came the knowledge that slaves still existed and were present in larger numbers than ever
before. Then the realization that a human being could be purchased within a few hours of my
home for under $100. Now only a few miles away. In the following years I've been learning the
myriad forms, places and types of slavery. The list keeps lengthening and with each new form
(to me), I learn about , it knocks me down, one more time.

Slavery

Debt Bondage
Sexual Slavery
Child Brides

Forced Labor

Child Soldiers
Adoption Trafficking
Organ Trafficking
Trafficked Athletes

And now a new one I should have seen coming.

Those very young, foreign models you see? Some of them were trafficked by model scouts who
literally trawled through some of the most destitute and vulnerable people on earth for them. The
same methods as other predatory traffickers; Go to politically or economically unstable areas,
locate 5'11 beautiful young girls; buy them, import them, own them, use them.

Horrible irony to have images that portray us to the world possibly be of slaves.

It’s hard to think of an area of our society that doesn't admire seeing it's most vaunted members
with a model on their arm. While this observation does not imply that those people were
trafficked, imagine how simple that makes it to approach a child or it’s family anywhere in the

world and offer them this in return for absolute control.

All the traffickers have to do is pull out a magazine or phone with videos on it.

Exceptional Public Schools Cited By 
Obama, Get Critical Backing From 
Investor, Jeffrey Epstein 
PR Newswire 
NEW YORK, July 5, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- A group of unique public high schools in New 
York State and New Jersey, cited by President Obama as role models for the nation, have 
received critical funding from science investor, Jeffrey Epstein and his foundation, The  
Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation. The schools are called the Bard High School Early College  
schools (BHSEC) in Manhattan and Queens of New York City and in Newark, New Jersey. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026567 
The Bard schools are not charter schools. They are financed by New York State and New 
Jersey. However, they run with the efficiency and success of a prominent charter school. 
The schools are small, with less than 600 students each and a student teacher ratio of 20 
to 1. Admission is academically exclusive, focusing on academic records, writing and math 
assessments and an eagerness for ideas and learning. And like most charter schools, the 
BHSEC schools critically have autonomy, even though they have to meet Regent state 
exams and state graduation guidelines. They have the autonomy to run their teaching 
staff, budget, operations and curriculum. 
Unlike charter schools however, BHSEC schools provide an entire high school curriculum 
in just two years and then two years of college level credits. After four years, students 
graduate with sixty college credits, a state Regents high school diploma and a Bard College 
Associate in Arts degree in the liberal arts and sciences. This accelerated approach comes 
from the schools' belief that many young people are ready and eager to do serious college 
work at age sixteen and that young adults' ambition to learn must be taken seriously. 
The results have been exceptional: 95% of BHSEC graduates attend college. In July 2009, 
President Obama, addressing the NAACP's centennial convention cited the schools as a 
role model for the nation: Innovations like Bard High School Early College and Medgar 
Evers College Preparatory School that are challenging students to complete high school 
and earn a free associate's degree or college credit in just four years. In 2012, The New 
York Observer ranked BHSEC as the #1 public high school in New York City, with an A+ 
grade, outranking the top private school. 
BHSEC has its roots in the college system. In June 2001, The New York City Board of 
Education and Bard College created Bard High School Early College with the support of 
the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Since the 1960's Bard College, originally called, 
Bard College of Simon's Rock, was the nation's only four year college and was designed for 
younger scholars. 
Competition is tough, Jeffrey Epstein notes, whose foundation actively supports public 
education across the country. Approximately 7,000 applicants compete for 150 seats each 
fall. So we need to continue working with state education boards to duplicate this 
successful model.

MODEL SHOP DENIES EPSTEIN TIE
By PageSix.com Staff - October 6, 2007 | 9:00am

THE owners of MC2 models are denying industry speculation that massage maven Jeffrey
Epstein is a secret financial backer of the agency being run by scandal-scarred Jean-Luc
Brunel, who was once accused of taking advantage of underage models.

Epstein, who this week agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes at his Florida
mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about 18 months, reportedly gave “millions” to
start MC2, which opened in October 2005 with offices in New York, Miami and Tel Aviv. One
of the girls Epstein, 54, was accused of soliciting massages from was described in court
documents as being just 14.

“E equals MC squared . . . get it, like the equation? E equals Epstein. He just thinks everyone is
too dumb to figure it out,” said a model industry insider. “He’s a desperate old man that
fantasizes and takes advantage of young girls.”

The trouble doesn’t stop there.

Karins Models founder Brunel, who’s currently a partner in MC2, denied allegations in a 1997
“60 Minutes” segment that he took advantage of young models who were high on drugs. Brunel
also reportedly left his Trump Tower digs in 1999 after complaints of night carousing, which he
also denied.

Disgraced former Elite models exec Gerald Marie is also involved with MC2, says our source.
Marie was accused of having sex with underage models in a 1999 BBC documentary where he
was filmed saying he hoped to seduce contestants in a modeling contest in which the average age
of participants was 15. He also dated Linda Evangelista when she was a teen.

““He’s also involved in the agency,” said the source. “Gerald and Jean-Luc like the same things.
They hang out because they have young girls in common, like two guys who enjoy the same

wine,”

MC2 president Jeffrey Fuller confirmed Brunel was a partner in the company, but denied any
working relationship with either Epstein or Marie.

“We have no relationship business-wise with Gerald Marie. Jeffrey Epstein has no ownership or
involvement in our company and never has. Jean-Luc Brunel and I are the only two partners and

owners of MC2 Model Management,” Fuller said.

Epstein’s rep said he was not involved in the agency. “He has no business relationship with
them,” said Howard Rubenstein.

Company A is a large U.S. engineering company with global operations in more than 50 countries, including a
number that have a high risk of corruption, such as Foreign Country. Company A's stock is listed on a national U.S. stock
exchange. In conducting its business internationally, Company A's officers and employees come into regular contact with
foreign officials, including officials in various ministries and state-owned entities. At a trade show, Company A has a booth
at which it offers free pens, hats, t-shirts, and other similar promotional items with Company A's logo. Company A also
serves free coffee, other beverages, and snacks at the booth. Some of the visitors to the booth are foreign officials.

ls Company A in violation of the FCPA?

No. These are legitimate, bona fide expenditures made in connection with the promotion, demonstration, or
explanation of Company A's products or services. There is nothing to suggest corrupt intent here. The FCPA does not
prevent companies from promoting their businesses in this way or providing legitimate hospitality, including to foreign
officials. Providing promotional items with company logos or free snacks as set forth above is an appropriate means of
providing hospitality and promoting business. Such conduct has never formed the basis for an FCPA enforcement action.

At the trade show, Company A invites a dozen current and prospective customers out for drinks, and pays
the moderate bar tab. Some of the current and prospective customers are foreign officials under the FCPA. Is
Company A in violation of the FCPA?

No. Again, the FCPA was not designed to prohibit all forms of hospitality to foreign officials. While the cost here may
be more substantial than the beverages, snacks, and promotional items provided at the booth, and the invitees specifically
selected, there is still nothing to suggest corrupt intent.

Two years ago, Company A won a long-term contract to supply goods and services to the state-owned Electricity
Commission in Foreign Country. The Electricity Commission is 100% owned, controlled, and operated by the
government of Foreign Country, and employees of the Electricity Commission are subject to Foreign Country's
domestic bribery laws. Some Company A executives are in Foreign Country for meetings with officials of the
Electricity Commission. The General Manager of the Electricity Commission was recently married, and during the
trip Company A executives present a moderately priced crystal vase to the General Manager as a wedding gift
and token of esteem. Ils Company A in violation of the FCPA?

No. It is appropriate to provide reasonable gifts to foreign officials as tokens of esteem or gratitude. It is important that
such gifts be made openly and transparently, properly recorded in a company’s books and records, and given only where

appropriate under local law, customary where given, and reasonable for the occasion.

During the course of the contract described above, Company A periodically provides training to Electricity
Commission employees at its facilities in Michigan. The training is paid for by the Electricity Commission as part of
the contract. Senior officials of the Electricity Commission inform Company A that they want to inspect the facilities
and ensure that the training is working well. Company A pays for the airfare, hotel, and transportation for the

Maine

2

Despite being one of 10 states to legalize marijuana for recreational use, health officials
in Maine recently ordered businesses in the state to remove CBD-infused edibles from
store shelves according to an article in the Portland Press Herald. Similar to California,
the Maine Department of Health and Human Services appears to be following the FDA’s
lead in determining that CBD is an unapproved food additive.

State health inspectors in Maine have reportedly told businesses to remove “all foods,
tinctures and capsules’ containing CBD from their shelves; however, business owners
can still sell “CBD products that can be smoked, vaped, worn as a patch or applied asa
lotion, and all medical marijuana patients can still buy oral CBDs from licensed
caregivers or dispensaries.”

New York

In response to the 2018 Farm Bill, the New York State Department of Agriculture and
Markets issued a FAQ dated Dec. 18, 2018 on the manufacture and sale of hemp-
derived CBD products. The department indicates that its current guidance is subject to
change and that it will likely be issuing additional regulations as the industry evolves.

The FAQ suggests that New York will allow the sale of CBD products sold as a topical or
dietary supplement (pill or tincture), the latter of which runs counter to FDA’s current
position. However, the guidance appears to restrict CBD products for vaping/inhalation.

Additionally, New York will require licensure and prior written approval to produce and
sell certain food and beverages under the New York State Industrial Hemp Research
Pilot Program. Licensees under the program can sell products that are “(1) listed in your
Research Plan and (2) produced in a facility meeting dietary-supplement GMP standards
and (3) properly labeled and packaged for sale pursuant to FDA regulations for dietary
supplements, and (4) in compliance with all provisions of the Research Partner
Agreement.”

Otherwise, New York will restrict the manufacture and sale of ready-to-eat food and
beverage products with added CBD infusions or CBD extracts and lists products such as
“CBD chocolate syrup, CBD soda, and CBD-infused frosting drizzled cookies.” In early
February, the New York Times reported that the New York Department of Health and
Mental Hygiene was beginning to more aggressively enforce this restriction in New York
City restaurants and eateries.

North Carolina

The North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services recently
announced its intent to issue warning letters to manufacturers and retailers who sell
products containing CBD oil in the state. According to a Feb 8 press release, North
Carolina will follow current federal laws, meaning that “CBD cannot legally be added to
any human food or animal feed that is for sale,” as CBD is the active ingredient in an
FDA-approved therapy and cannot be considered a dietary supplement.

North Carolina intends to take an “educate before regulate stance with industry,”
according to the release. However, the state will “reserve the right to be more assertive”
to ensure consumer health and safety, likely meaning product embargoes and seizures.

Executive Summary

Will the Alts simplify their structure and convert to
C-corporations from partnerships? What would this
mean for valuations? We think the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
could accelerate cost-benefit analyses and decision-
making by management teams as a 21% federal tax rate vs.
35% previously implies less tax leakage and less expense in
moving from single-layer taxation to a double taxation
structure. While investors would give up economics in the
process, the new business structure would, we think, com-
mand a higher valuation multiple.

For context, investor questions on the topic have picked up
recently, including from a number of long-only accounts, which
have historically avoided the Alts. Some investors have said they
currently cannot invest in Alts given the partnership structure but
would be interested and able to do work on them if they were to con-
vert to C-corps. We had conversations around conversion a year ago
as President Trump took office amid promises of tax reform, and the
subject came up on nearly every 4Q16 earnings call. Management
teams seemed to table the idea because of too many moving parts
that needed to be clarified before they conduct a proper cost/benefit
analysis. Post tax reform, conversion is at the top of investors@ninds

and becomes a key debate/catalyst for the sector.

We believe Ares Management L.P. (ARES, Equal-weight) could be
the first Alt to convert to a C-corp, potentially sparking other
conversions within our coverage. We believe this prospect has
likely driven much of the stock©24% return year-to-date and +16%
outperformance vs. the S&P 500 and +10% its Alts peers. Over the
past few months, ARES management has stated clearly that they
have been actively considered conversion. CFO Mike McFerran
recently told investors, This topic has become clearly very elevated
in light of possible tax reform. Absent that and even before this
became so topical, this is the thing we@e been thinking about. And
the overarching question is, can public traded partnerships attract
the breadth of shareholder base to support an appropriate valuation
notwithstanding some other obstacles. Even without tax reform,
the company was considering the structure change, and with a 21%
corporate statutory rate (vs. 35%), we believe cost-benefit analysis
may make sense for ARES. The company reports earnings on
Thursday, February 15, and we expect an update or additional
color on conversion. We think all Alts shares could benefit as
investors see a higher probability of others following in their
footsteps and/or investors re-rate AltsGRE higher.

NORTH AMERICA INSIGHT ~~

Against this backdrop, we@e created a conversion scorecard
with qualitative pros/cons for each company. To be clear, these are
our views on where conversion makes the most sense and not calls on
which companies will commit or the timing of potential conversions.
We focus selectively on the factors we view as most important in

deciding whether to convert.

e FRE %ofEarningsD We believe the higher fee related earn-
ings as a % of total earnings, the more likely for a re-rating of
the shares and therefore more likely to consider C-corp con-

version.

e Effective Tax Rate D The lower the current tax rate, the
more tax slippage if companies convert and are subject toa
higher corporate tax rate, and lower EPS. Conversely, compa-
nies with a higher tax rate today already have more tax
leakage, and thus could make sense to pay a little more tax in

a corporate structure for a broader investor base.

e Current P/ERatioD The lower the current P/E multiple, the
more management may be inclined to take action to drive a

re-rating.

© Management Commentary D Lastly we look at manage-
ment commentary from earnings calls/conferences to assess
the extent that companies are evaluating conversion and seri-

ously considering it as a strategic option.

over the fate of our livers, an Al-enabled weapons system of sort will come ripping
through our world. This need not be a fully-escaped McGuyver system making pipe-
bombs from our cars; even existing technology tools when salted with AI can be
slipped into an accidental gear - particularly when they begin interacting with one
another. Such AI weapons systems will be trained to operate and move along the
most invisible elements of our topologies, sometimes pulling violently at life support
cords for currency or logistics or trade but also - perhaps more dangeroulsly - we
will find them insinuated into cognition systems we will come to depend upon,
whispering into our ears or tapping us on the shoulder “Look that way!” when in
fact we should be gazing at some other gaping hole. Of course the problems of how
Al-enabled machines are permitted to touch our commerce or our brains or our

should have a Coke. It would make people like you.” But these “civilian” problems

network attack and defense is racing at us and will emerge in the form of smartened
weapons. The project of developing a national security or arms control doctrines or
treaty frames in these fields has not even begun. Really this means, since we've no
hope of honestly controlling every AI that could be possibly written: How do we
design the topologies on which Als operate??”° Can we protect ourelves? In the
rooms where AI systems “values” are being carefully poked and limited, it’s vitally
important that the lessons of history and war have a first place at the table. Sucha
conversation, informed by all the popping Seventh Sense warnings we've seen in
this book and by a catalog of specificly sharp dangers of diplomacy and security,
must happen in cold blood. It will be impossible to tackle these problems cleanly in
the heat of an emergency. In our jack-filling enthusiasm for the new, we’d be wise to
also gate ourselves and these Al-fired dangers as best we can. For as long as possible.
Which, unfortunately, will not be forever.

At the start of this book, I explained how the future will unspool: First, there will be
a struggle between those who have the Seventh Sense and those who don’t. This is
playing out around us today. In the end, the people without the Seventh Sense will
lose, because people who fight the future always lose. Then there will be a battle
between different groups who have the Seventh Sense, each wired for different aims
and instincts. Networks of terror taking on networks of bots. Gene adjusting health
protocols competing to become the platform of choice. This battle for the topological
high-ground, where unimaginable profit, power and security linger, awaits us. If
we're lucky, it will unfold in a co-evolutionary way. Everyone will be better off. But
then, finally, there will be a contest between the winners of final topological mastery
and the system itself. The Boxers against the Box. The AI machines will have the
Seventh Sense, too. Just as computers can see better than us, hear better, or
remember longer so the device webs of our future will own this new, essential sense
with unimpeachable fidelity. They will glow with it, honed to a sensitive sharpness
more acute than any human will ever achieve. What do we do then? We are already

The Crooked Course:
Step by Step on the Path to Peace

INTRODUCTION

As Immanuel Kant observed, “out of the crooked timber of humanity no straight thing
was ever made.” And the Middle East peace process is no exception. It runs a crooked
course. This work provides a paper trail of the meandering and rocky path of the peace
process. Relevant documents related to the Arab-Israeli conflict over the past century
(since the Sykes—Picot Agreement of 1916) are compiled in this book. It provides an
annotated and chronological overview of attempts to make peace in one of the most
difficult and protracted conflicts in the world, and it includes a full set of accompanying
maps specially made for this edition.

The sheer volume of such a work raises the critical problem of how to present the
documents in a way that facilitates their accessibility and understanding. A simple
chronological ordering would miss important connections between the documents,
which are thus better grouped by common theme. To this end, we have divided the
volume into five thematic Parts. Part I compiles documents related to the formal peace
agreements between Israel and the Palestinians, as well as those related to Israel’s
unilateral disengagement from Gaza. The documents in Part I] relate to the many
informal peace proposals and ideas offered over the years that have served to contribute
to more official processes at a later date. Part III compiles the many important United
Nations documents specifically related to the question of Palestine. Part IV sets the
Israeli-Palestinian issue in a broader context, providing regional papers going back a
century, up to the latest documents. Finally, Part V compiles Israeli and Palestinian
domestic documents relevant to the quest for peace in the Middle East.

Grouping the documents by theme highlights the evolution of particular aspects of
the conflict and the peace process over time. When examined as a group, these
documents provide valuable insights on the events, conditions, and actions that have
been most important in influencing the different phases of the peace process.

For guidance, the reader will find a chronological overview of all the documents and
key events.

ON PART I: PEACE AGREEMENTS AND THE
DISENGAGEMENT FROM GAZA
Nothing about the quest for peace in the Middle East has been simple or easily attained.
Merely bringing Palestinians and Israelis together was a feat that took decades to

achieve. Despite all the efforts exerted by not only the principal parties, but also local
actors, regional neighbors, and international players, agreements between the two sides

"
IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014773.txt,"in 2011 called the law a calamity that increases business uncertainty and undermines
growth. Under Atkins, the transition team posted a statement that it will be “working to
dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act and replace it with new policies to encourage economic
growth and job creation. At this point there are no details on what parts of Dodd-Frank
are most likely to be repealed, but Republican financial policy leaders appear pro-
markets and have flagged free movement of capital via open markets as the best policy
for economic growth and risk transparency.

There are several dislocations across markets today that we think have a chance of
normalizing in the tail-risk event that deregulation results in increased availability of
leverage and ability to take more risk. We have discussed these dislocations as resulting
in part from the lack of ability of hedge funds and other relative-value traders to access
enough balance sheet at a low enough cost to help these trades normalize. The top
trades we could see benefitting from the return of leverage would be:

e« Normalization of swap spreads; balance-sheet intensive Treasuries, both nominal
and TIPS, are very cheap versus OIS and Libor swap rates.

« Normalization of cross-currency basis swaps, which currently allow USD-based
investors the ability to buy very cheap EUR- and JPY-denominated assets via the
basis swap.

¢ Normalization of coupon STRIPS versus principal STRIPS as these yield differentials
are near their all-time wides, particularly in the 2030-38 maturity bucket.

As a tail risk for deregulation, we like buying 30y swap spreads, a credit-risk-free
floating-rate US Treasury asset that provides 3m Libor + 56bp annually, which is about
100bp cheap to pre-crisis levels. Swap spreads could also benefit from deregulation that
removes cash and Treasury bonds from the leverage ratio requirements, which would
provide the ability of the dealer community to more easily absorb Treasury supply in the
primary and secondary markets.

The main risk is that policy changes retain strict capital requirements, which would
continue to limit the availability of leverage. For example, the Financial Choice Act, a
product of Texas Representative Jeb Hensarling's team, would provide banks an off-
ramp option to all Basel 3 requirements as long as banks hold a 10% capital ratio. This
plan would probably decrease the availability of leverage, and could also result in
reduced demand for short-dated Treasuries in HQLA portfolios. Another risk to 30y
swap spread normalization in particular would be a material increase in deficit spending
as part of a fiscal stimulus package. This would likely further cheapen Treasuries versus
swaps and other benchmark interest rates.

Trade recommendation: Buy 30y Treasuries versus 30y matched Libor swap at
3mL+56bp. Target 3mL + Obp, stop loss 3mL+75bp.

Tail risk 2: Comeback of Eurozone risk premia

EZ risk hedges: 30s50s flatteners in BTPs, buy EUR/HUF vol

In Europe, the biggest market risk for 2017 is arguably a comeback of stress on
peripheral sovereigns. The next 12 months provide plenty of triggers, with increasing
concerns about the ability of ECB to continue with QE, and an intense political season
ahead (referendum in Italy on 4 Dec, and elections in France and Germany in 2017).

As hedges to Eurozone risks, we recommend buying 30s50s flatteners in BTPs as the
cheapest way to express a bearish view on the periphery, and buying EUR/HUF vol as a
proxy for Euro instability with better pricing than EUR/USD vol.

Concerns on EU politics and the ECB would likely lead to a switch of market focus from
monetary policy to fundamentals. The periphery would be hurt by this new focus: public
debt to GDP remains very high, and the low debt service costs enjoyed in the past five
years favored debt accumulation, rather than debt reduction (Chart 73). The cyclical

Tightly interactive hybrid:neural and symbolic components interact
frequently, on the same time scale as their internal learning operations

Fig. 4.8: Broad categories of neural-symbolic architecture

Within the scope of hybrid neural-symbolic systems, there is another axis which Bader and
Hitzler do not focus on, because the main interest of their review is in monolithic systems. We
call this axis interactivity’, and what we are referring to is the frequency of high-information-
content, high-influence interaction between the neural and symbolic components in the hybrid
system. In a low-interaction hybrid system, the neural and symbolic components don’t exchange
large amounts of mutually influential information all that frequently, and basically act like
independent system components that do their learning/reasoning /thinking periodically sending
each other their conclusions. In some cases, interaction may be asymmetric: one component may
frequently send a lot of influential information to the other, but not vice versa. However, our
hypothesis is that the most capable neural-symbolic systems are going to be the symmetrically
highly interactive ones.

In a symmetric high-interaction hybrid neural-symbolic system, the neural and symbolic
components exchange influential information sufficiently frequently that each one plays a major
role in the other one’s learning /reasoning/thinking processes. Thus, the learning processes of
each component must be considered as part of the overall dynamic of the hybrid system. The
two components aren’t just feeding their outputs to each other as inputs, they’re mutually
guiding each others’ internal processing.

One can make a speculative argument for the relevance of this kind of architecture to neuro-
science. It seems plausible that this kind of neural-symbolic system roughly emulates the kind
of interaction that exists between the brain’s neural subsystems implementing localist symbolic
processing, and the brain’s neural subsystems implementing globalist, classically “connection-
ist” processing. It seems most likely that, in the brain, symbolic functionality emerges from
an underlying layer of neural dynamics. However, it is also reasonable to conjecture that this
symbolic functionality is confined to a functionally distinct subsystem of the brain, which then

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019418.txt,"In July, the Texas transportation department decided to convert 83 miles of state road in six oil-boom counties from
pavement to gravel, to reduce repair costs and slow traffic.

Trucks filled with Eagle Ford crude are also heading 100 miles west to a barge canal. The first barge of crude departed in
September 2011, heading south toward the Gulf of Mexico and refineries near Houston. Now the canal moves 1.6 million
barrels a month, says Jennifer Stastny, executive director of the Port of Victoria.

It's like putting your 5-year-old to bed one night and he wakes up the next morning as a 16-year-old, with the appetite and
demands of a 16-year-old,” she says.

In North Dakota, trains move 69% of the state's 800,000 barrels a day of crude, according to state figures. Energy
companies say they value rail's ability to deliver crude to the highest-paying markets.

But the deadly runaway crude train crash in Canada's Quebec province in July, which incinerated a small town and killed at
least 47 people, highlighted the risks of the mile-long crude trains crisscrossing the country. The U.S. government is
imposing new regulations on oil shipments by rail.

Some state regulators wonder if their local efforts leave them prepared for a train accident, in part because federal railroad
rules pre-empt state and local control over trains.

In Washington state, we can't say [to train operators] you have to have oil-spill contingency plans in order to operate, says
Curt Hart, a spokesman for the state's Department of Ecology. We do that for oil tankers, barges, large commercial vessels
and refineries.

Home to five refineries, the state levies a per-barrel tax on crude delivered by tankers and barges, which pays for spill-
response officials and inspectors. The tax doesn't apply to rail shipments.

The American Association of Railroads says itis prepared for growing crude shipments because it has long carried
hazardous cargoes. In 2008, major U.S. railroads carried 9,500 carloads of crude, the association says, and are on pace this
year to carry 389,000.

Most industry analysts believe that while crude on trains will last, truck and barge traffic will decline once new pipelines
come into service.

Environmental groups have criticized some pipeline projects, including the Keystone XL, meant to move Canadian oil to
Gulf Coast refineries. The federal government is still studying the Keystone pipeline and has yet to issue needed permits.

Steve Kean, president and chief operating officer of Kinder Morgan Inc., KMI +0.30% one of several interrelated companies
that own or operate 82,000 miles of North American pipeline, says government agencies thoroughly vet new projects.

Falling imports, infrastructure investments and increased manufacturing are just some of the benefits of newly abundant

energy supplies, he says. This has got to be one of the best things that has happened in our economy in the past 10 years.

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

The Unheeded Warning

“The NSA—the world’s most capable signals intelligence organization, an agency immensely skilled in stealing
digital data—had had its pockets thoroughly picked.”

m= --CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell

In April 2010, the CIA received a stark reminder of the ongoing nature of Russian
espionage. It came in the form of a message from one of its best placed moles in the Russian
intelligence service. This surreptitious source was Alexander Poteyev, a 54-year old colonel in the
SVR, which was the successor agency to the First Chief Directorate of the KGB. While the FSB
took over the KGB’s domestic role in December 1991, the SVR became Russia's Foreign
Intelligence Service. Its operation center was in the Yasenevo district of Moscow. The CIA had
recruited Poteyev as its mole in the 1990s when he had been stationed at the Russian Embassy in
Washington DC. That it could sustain a mole in Moscow for over a decade attested to its
capabilities in the espionage business. After he returned to Moscow, still secretly on the CIA’s
payroll, he became the deputy chief of the SVR’s “American” section. This unit of Russian
intelligence had the primary responsibility for establishing spies in CIA, FBI, NSA and other
American intelligence agencies.

The SVR’s last known (or caught) mole in US Intelligence was CIA officer Harold Nicholson
in 1996. Before it could now expand its espionage capabilities. It needed to build a network of
Russian sleeper agents in the United States. For this network, it needed to groom so-called
“illegals,” or agents who were not connected to the Russian Embassy. This so-called “illegals”
network was necessary since presumably all Russian diplomats, including the so-called “legal”
members of Russian intelligence, were under constant surveillance by the FBI. Advances in
surveillance technology in the 21“ century had made it increasingly difficult to communicate with
recruit through its diplomatic missions. To evade it, the “American” division of the SVR was
given the task of placing individuals in the United States disguised as ordinary Americans. Their
“legend,” or operational cover, could be thin since they would not be applying for jobs in the
government. Their job was simply blend in with their community until they were called upon by
the “American” department in Moscow to service a mole that had been planted in US intelligence
or other part of the US government. Until there were activated by such a call, they were
classified as sleeper agents. Unlike the SVR’s “legal” officers, who were attached to Russian
embassies as diplomats and were protected from arrest by the Treaty of Vienna, the SVR’s illegal
agents lack diplomatic immunity. According to Pavel Sudoplatov, who defected from the KGB in
the Cold War, the sole job of such sleeper agents was to “live under cover in the West awaiting
assignments for the Center.” One assignment that justifies the expense of maintaining such
agents is to service a penetration, after one is made, in the US intelligence establishment. While

pressure should lower-cost packages impact their volumes.

Vision implies a long process
To us, the government's vision implies a two stage process over a long time-frame:

e Inthe short-term: improve the quality of care offered in the public sector,
potentially with the assistance of private healthcare

e In the long-term: Only when public facilities have improved, privatise such facilities
(although one medical city is to be privatised under a public-private partnership)

e Concurrently: Prepare for a roll-out of private health insurance to finance private
provision

Abu Dhabi and Dubai are probably not parallels

In Abu Dhabi and Dubai, private healthcare was encouraged to avoid expats relying on
public facilities. The large expat population in proportion to the locals (85:15) supported
the creation of private facilities that it was then possible for the governments to fully
fund Emiratis to use. The quality of public facilities was not a cause for concern - many
Emiratis still prefer to use government facilities for more serious problems.

Expat population and quality of public system differ in Saudi

The proportion of expats (33% of the population) is not large enough to drive the
establishment of a large, high quality private hospital base sufficient to serve the entire
Saudi population. Additionally, the quality of both care and infrastructure in the public
system is seen as lacking, suggesting additional investment in facilities is required.

Degree to which private sector will benefit is uncertain

Given the lack of detail provided to date, it is hard to assess the benefits, or risks to the
incumbent private hospital operators in detail. We see two main ways the private sector
can participate in healthcare reform:

e Win contracts to run and improve public health facilities
e Benefit from volume growth any roll-out of private health insurance could spur

e Participate in privatisations

In the long-term, volumes up but pricing down, likely to benefit nonetheless

At present there is limited supply of quality private hospitals and the incumbents are in
a strong bargaining position with insurers. Greater private hospital supply, and
competition, would likely pressure pricing, and margins in the longer-term, albeit offset
by increased volumes. Assuming only basic services are offered to most citizens under
any government-driven scheme, there would still be a place for offering higher-quality
accommodation for example, to higher-income patients.

Private sector could win public hospital contracts

Private operators could be allocated management contracts for public hospitals to
improve efficiency of existing hospitals, train public sector administrators and raise
clinical standards. Presumably reimbursement under such contracts would be based on a
fixed fee, potentially with performance clauses for improved outcomes or lowering
costs. More substantive contracts, where the private operator is responsible for all
aspects of operating the hospital could be more accretive, but bring greater financial
risk.

Hillis-style neural computer could handle grew from 1 million to 100 billion. This
speed did produce things very like science fiction: Accurate voice recognition. Real-
time genetics. And it also began to mark out, clearly, the powerful network territory
where our future will be decided.

<P

Of all the things that mark a change between our modern lives and the days of those
who came before us, few are as sensationally obvious as the sheer acceleration of
life, the reduction of delay and the emerging instantness of experience. Faster. What
is going on inside the machines, as Mel Conway’s old law would have told us, is
happening too on the surface of our lives. A feeling of breathlessness in the face of
speed isn’t new, of course. When Anna Karenina folds herself under an oncoming
train at the end of Tolstoy’s novel, for instance, her suicide is as much metaphor as
personal tragedy, a comment on the disorienting steam, engine, and rail pace of
modernity. Speed kills, old habits and ideas particularly. Between 1840 and 1940
travel times between Anna’s St. Petersburg and Vronsky’s Moscow shrunk by 10
minutes every year on average, loosing deep cracks in Russian economics and
politics, tearing apart Anna’s slow-moving world of glittering balls and hereditary
estates with the fast force of industry, modernity and then the awful pliers of
communism. Tolstoy’s own death in 1910 held a bit of this acute tension between
old and new velocities: At 82, hoping to live out his final days in the peace of a small
hut, he left his family for the rural Russian town of Sharmardino. By train. He died at
a station on the way, stopped quite literally, like an absurd figure in a Gogol novel, as
he was enacting the tragedy of trying to use the modern to get to the past.

At the same time in the late 19 Century, the American rail system was working its
own transformation, but with almost no ambivalence. America was using the
modern to get to the future - as fast as possible. This was a decisive difference in
temperament. “The American frontier,” Frederick Jackson Turner wrote in his
famous 1894 essay about borders and American life, “is sharply distinguished from
the European frontier—a fortified boundary line running through dense
populations.”1% American rails and roads (and trade) encountered no substantial
fortifications. They ran nearly unchecked into the wilderness. The only apparent
limit to expansion, that generation thought, was technology itself. The trains had,
from the start, an unusual purchase in American life. During the three decades after
1840, the refinement of small but important details - faster train engines, stiffer
carriage design, tracks that were straighter, an ability to move and re-load boxcars
at night, better time-table management - eased America into the steam engine age

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021317.txt,"Evolution of social connection by
communication

The human social brain
constructs connection and understanding
by anthropomorphic projection as
discussed by Nick Epley in his chapter.
When we observe the behavior of
nonhuman entities, anthropomorphic
projection may form a feeling of social
connection. Social connection depends
in part on empathic responses to
observed action. It has been argued that
this same foundation is the basis for the
evolution of language as well--observed
action may be the foundation for
language.”

A mirror neuron theory of the
evolution of language starts with the
assumption that we understand others by
observing their actions. Communication
depends on the regularization of typical
actions that can be pantomimed. In
principle this could lead to a kind of
manual gestural system of
communication akin to sign language.
Hand and arm movements can depict a
wide range of actions both by first-
person depiction of an action such as
screwing the top onto a jar and by third-
person depictions such as using the
fingers to portray a person walking.
Hand and arm postures can depict
objects such as a cupped hand
representing a bowl. Combining
sequences of such object and action
depictions can communicate relatively
complex messages even without a
formal language. This is a far cry from
sign languages in which the mapping
between hand shapes and movements is
not visually transparent in this way. But
as the pressure to communicate a
broader range of messages increases, a
manual gestural language would have to
be modified to reflect more abstract

Page |71

symbols ultimately leading in the
direction of a sign language.

However, this kind of manual
language has one major drawback.
Communication depends on visual
contact. In order to understand a
gestural message it is necessary to see
the hand movements. This limits the
distances over which communication can
take place. Moreover, a communication
system that is effective for a group
should not depend on face-to-face
dyadic interaction, but allow for more
broadcast communications. There is a
great survival advantage in being able to
maintain social connection and convey
information over distances that go well
beyond face-to-face communication.

Many species of fish,
amphibians, reptiles, birds, and
mammals commonly exchange
information at a distance through
vocalizations. The learned songs (and
some calls) of songbirds are particularly
rich sources of information conveying,
to the receiver, individual identity and a
host of other characteristics of the
sender. Some mammals exchange
information at great distances through
calling behavior. Humpback whale
vocalizations are perceived over
extremely long distances and may be
used to maintain social groups at
distances as great as 5 km. African
elephants can recognize friends and
relatives from their calls at a distance of
2.5 km. Human sheepherders keep each
other company from the top of one
mountain to another in the Canary
Islands using a whistled language called
Silbo Gomero. Whether for purposes of
mating, threat, warning, or social
organization, conveying information
regarding location, identity and
motivation, and directed at one
individual or towards far-flung groups,

Paton the back or force for good: what purpose do development awards serve?
Mark Tran — Guardian blog

Divyesh Thakkar has just returned from refugee camps in Ethiopia, where he was surprised to see portable solar lanterns
designed by his company still in use three years after their distribution.

The batteries for the prototype lamps were expected to last only two years, but were still functioning at the Jijiga camp near
the Somali border.

It's amazing they're still working and to see them changing lives, said Thakkar, who is based in Leicester. People are
going to university thanks to the lamp.

The solar lantern, which looks like an old-fashioned kerosene hurricane lamp, won an innovation award last year at AidEx,
an annual trade show bringing together suppliers and buyers of products for the aid industry. The lamp has a built-in solar
panel to charge its four AA-sized batteries.

The lantern has an obvious advantage over kerosone-fuelled equivalents: with no flame or smoke emissions, it is safer and
more environmentally friendly. The batteries are made for 500 cycles, or about two years, but the longevity of the lamps in
Ethiopia has come as a pleasant surprise. In a novel twist, the lantern, which costs $38 (£24.50), can also be used to charge
mobile phones.

The award provided a huge fillip for Thakkar's company, Sunlite. As word spread, relief agencies placed increasingly large
orders. About 100,000 of the lamps have been (or are being) used after emergencies in Japan, the Philippines, Thailand and
Syria.

Sunlite makes 15,000 lamps a month at two plants in India, including one in a special economic zone in Gujarat state.

Next month, there will be a new winner at AidEx in Brussels, the third year of the award. The innovation award sits alongside
a crowded field of honours in the development world, although AidEx is geared more towards humanitarian needs.

Awards seem to be proliferating. Last month, 53 finalists met in Washington to showcase ideas to save the lives of mothers
and newborns in developing countries. The award is given by the Saving Lives at Birth partnership, launched in 2011, which
includes USAid, Norway, Grand Challenges Canada, backed by the Canadian government, the UK's Department for
International Development, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

In October, the Mo Ibrahim foundation will announce its prize for achievement in African leadership, established in 2007.
Past winners include presidents Joaquim Chissano and Festus Gontebanye Mogae, of Mozambique and Botswana
respectively, although the prize is not awarded if no one meets the criteria.

Sceptics may wonder whether these accolades contribute meaningfully to development, or exist only to make donors feel
good while sidestepping more fundamental, structural issues. Forinstance, the Gates foundation awarded $100,000 to the
California Institute of Technology last year for designing a solar-powered toilet that breaks down water and human waste
into hydrogen gas for use in fuel cells.

The competition was for next-generation toilets to improve sanitation in the developing world. Would that money have

been better spent on supporting community-led total sanitation — a project to end open defecation that has had considerable
success?

humanity.

This is a lean explanation of why evil evolved and how it develops within individuals and
societies. It is an explanation that strips evil down to its root causes, focusing on the core psychological

ingredients that enable us to violate moral norms and cause excessive harms to innocent others.

A difficult journey

This book takes you on a journey into evil. It is a story about our evolutionary past, our present state of
affairs, and the prospects for our future. It is as much a story about you and me, as it is about all of our
ancestors and future children. It is a story about the nature of moral decay and the prospects of moral
growth. It is story about society’s capacity to engineer great harm, and about our own individual
responsibility to avoid joining in.

Explaining how our genes create brains that create a psychology of desire and denial that leads to
excessive harms provides a satisfying explanation for the landscape of evil. It explains all varieties of evil
by showing how particular genetic combinations can create moral monsters and how particular
environmental conditions can convert good citizens into uncaring killers and extortionists. This
explanation will not allow us to banish evil from the world. Rather, it will enable us to understand why
some individuals acquire an addiction to feeling good by making others feel bad, and why others cause
unimaginable harm to innocent victims while flying the flag of virtue. This, in turn, will help us gain
greater awareness of our own vulnerabilities by monitoring the power of attraction between desire and

denial.

Dershowitz Goes Off on Woman Who Made Underage Sex
Allegations: ‘She Should Be Seriously Punished’

Just hours after convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein agreed to settle
a civil case brought against him by attorney Bradley
Edwards, Epstein’s lawyer from his past criminal case, Alan
Dershowitz, discussed his former client on the Law&Crime Network.
Epstein was accused of trafficking more than 40 underage girls for
sex, and one such girl claimed Dershowitz himself had sex with her
when she was underage.
Dershowitz vehemently denies the claim, telling host Brian Ross that
accuser Virginia Roberts is a “certified, complete, total liar,” and that
her allegations are a “complete and total fabrication.” He also added
that she should be punished by the law for what she did.
The Harvard Law Professor Emeritus noted that Roberts’ allegations
were eventually withdrawn, and that the FBI recognized the
evidence showed he was not where she said he was. He pointed to
documented evidence that proves he is innocent.
“I can prove conclusively that she made the whole thing up,”
Dershowitz said, citing travel records that he says prove where he
was at the time she claims she had sex with him. “It’s conclusive,
conclusive evidence.”
“More importantly, I can prove where I wasn’t,” he said, after stating
outright, “Never met her, don’t know who she is, never heard of her.”
Similarly, Dershowitz said that Roberts claimed that notable figures
such as Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and Tipper Gore were present on an

island, when Secret Service records proved they were never even
there.
Dershowitz said Roberts’ allegations were part of an extortion plot,
and that she “should be seriously punished for submitting false
information and a false affidavit.”
The attorney emphasized that Roberts has not been willing to repeat
her allegations against him in public, and that she has only accused
him in the context of litigation, which affords certain protections.

“She simply hides behind litigation privileges,” Dershowitz said,
encouraging Ross to call Roberts and see if she would repeat her
claims. “And if she does, I will be in court the next day suing her for
defamation and I will win the case ’cause I can prove conclusively
that she made up the whole story from top to bottom.”
Ross then turned to the controversial deal that Epstein received from
federal prosecutors who were investigating the trafficking case
against him. Federal prosecutors agreed not to prosecute him, and let
him plead guilty to state charges that resulted in a 13-month prison
sentence that allowed Epstein to leave prison during the day for
work. Federal prosecutors allegedly did not even inform victims
before making the deal, which is now the subject of a request for an
Inspector General investigation. Congressional Democrats said in a
letter that they want to know more about the circumstances
surrounding the deal, which was made by then-U.S. Attorney and
current Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta.
As Epstein’s defense attorney in that case, Dershowitz is not upset
about it the deal at all.
“I’m very proud of that deal, that’s what lawyers are supposed to do,”
he said. “Lawyers are supposed to get the best deals they can.” If he
could have gotten 10 months or no time at all, that would have been
even better, he said.
Acosta said in the past that Epstein’s lawyers, including Dershowitz,
put pressure on his office by investigating his staff. Dershowitz has
denied this.
“Acosta was very tough,” Dershowitz said, contrary to concerns that
he did anything improper. Dershowitz pointed out that the problem
feds had was proving that girls were transported in interstate
commerce.

competitive devaluation, which risks a
new protectionism. Currency
manipulation could become a danger
that reaches far beyond the debate about
Chinese policies. The world economy
will need at some point to withdraw the
drug of cheap money and negative real
interest rates. The U.S. should anticipate
these dangers.

The International Monetary Fund also
could help set standards about exchange-
rate policies and serve as a referee that
blows a whistle, even if it cannot
penalize. The IMF and the World Trade
Organization should anticipate this risk
and give effect to the existing WTO
agreement that economies must avoid
manipulating exchange rates . . . to gain
an unfair competitive advantage.

Third, the U.S. needs to break the logjam
on opening markets. As the leading world
economy, America should initially try to
strengthen and increase international
trade through the WTO. As my
colleagues at the Peterson Institute have
pointed out, there are gains from the
stymied Doha Round of trade
negotiations that should be harvested
now: ending agricultural export
subsidies; limiting food export controls;
eliminating tariffs and quotas for almost
all exports of the poorest countries;
facilitating customs and clearance

courts basically abolished the tort of malicious prosecution
in Florida. My case was dismissed. I then appealed that. And
our district ruled that my malicious prosecution claim can
stand and the tort is not abolished in Florida. They sent it
back to the trial court and Jeffrey Epstein appealed that to
the State Supreme Court, and that’s where that stands.

Sarah Kellen

“She said her name was Clara something on the rental applica-
tion,” says a real estate agent in Palm Beach. “It wasn’t until
much later that I realized she was associated with Epstein.”

In April of 2009, that agent rented Clara a bungalow in Palm
Beach. For Clara, that little home was a step down from Jeffrey
Epstein’s big house on FE] Brillo Way and from the life she’d known
as Sarah Kellen. But not such a step down. “She signed a lease to
pay four thousand dollars a month from April 18 through July 18,
2009,” says a Palm Beach resident familiar with the local housing
market. “But she stayed a lot longer. And by the way, she went ona
round-the-world trip for at least a month while she had the lease.”

Kellen had been a prime suspect in Chief Reiter's investigation.
Prosecutors had considered charging her, Wendy Dobbs, and Nadia
Marcinkova as potential coconspirators. They'd avoided those
charges as part of the plea deal that Epstein had struck—a deal in
the course of which it was suggested that if Epstein had to have
pleaded to something, he could have pleaded to striking Kellen—or
slapping her, once, on his jet. Assault, they'd have called it.

4 December: Italian constitutional referendum

Our base case is a close “No” vote where Renzi stays and no snap election, given
current polls and the outstanding electoral reform court case. BTPs and the banks
recaps remain a tail risks for the Italian economy, although the ECB extending QE
should help. A big “No” vote would boost Five Star and undermine Renzi into 2018
elections, in our view.

4 December: Austrian presidential election

Polls by public broadcaster ORF show the result as very close. Norbert Hofer is
standing on an anti-immigrant platform against the moderate former Green leader
Alexander Van der Bellen in a rerun of the May vote. The election of Freedom party
candidate Norbert Hofer would make Austria the first nation to elect a head of state
running on a far right platform since the EU began.

22/ 29 Jan: French Socialist Party presidential nominee elections

If President Francois Hollande decides to run for re-election as the Socialist Party
candidate (decision expected Dec 10th) he could be challenged by former Prime
Minister Manuel Valls and Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg. Current second
round polls for any combination of these candidates suggest likely Socialist nominee
too close to call.

15 March 2017: Dutch elections

Prime Minister Mark Rutte currently leads a “purple” coalition with the Dutch Labour
party as main second party. But the latest polls suggest both parties could win fewer
seats than they have now in 2017. That could make it more challenging to build a
government given the need to secure at least 76/150 seats. In terms of who could
lead that coalition, polls have Rutte’s People’s Party neck and neck with the anti-
immigrant Freedom party led by populist Geert Wilders. Wilders has called for the
Netherlands to leave the EU indicated he would call a referendum if elected. A
Wilder-Rutte coalition also hasn’t been ruled out according to press reports.

23 April: French first round presidential elections

The first round of voting for the next French president will be on 23 April. First
round polling suggests the leader of the anti-EU Front National Marine Le Pen is
expected to progress to the decisive runoff. At present Republican Candidate
Francois Fillon is also expected to make it through.

7 May 2017: French second round presidential elections

Current polls, albeit their validity has been called into question by events in 2016,
show Fillon securing 65-70% of the vote vs Le Pen in a runoff (see chart below). We
note that when her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, faced Jacques Chirac in the 2002
Presidential elections the FN candidate only received 18% of the vote. Nevertheless,
we see a potential Le Pen win as the biggest political risk event for European (and
possibly global) equity markets in 2017.

By 22 October 2017: German Federal elections

Current Chancellor Angela Merkel has announced that she intends to stand for re-
election. Current polls have Merkel’s CDU ahead followed by SDP with the euro-
sceptic Alternative fur Deutschland, Greens and Die Linke competing for third spot.
While it may be necessary for Merkel to maintain the grand coalition with the SDP,
our central case is that we see a continuation of the current German administration
and that German elections carry less risk than the earlier French presidential
elections.

The “entourage effect” refers to the overall user experience produced by the interactions among all
active compounds in the cannabis plant. The various cannabinoids and terpenes in a particular can-
nabis plant are believed to work synergistically with each other and with the human endocannabinoid
system to create an effect very different from the effect any one compound would create. This phenom-
enon may partially explain why different cannabis strains are used to treat diverse medical conditions.

There are several generally accepted examples of the entourage effect. CBD is believed to regulate
the psychoactive effects of THC and reduce short-term memory loss, sleepiness and paranoia that may
be caused by THC. Myrcene is understood to enable and hasten the psychoactive effect of THC by
lowering resistance posed by the blood-brain barrier and increasing the THC saturation capacity of the
CB1 receptors. Other terpenes have been shown to block endocannabinoid receptors in the brain while
promoting bonding by endocannabinoid receptors located elsewhere in the body.

Many cannabinoid and terpene formulations developed for therapeutic applications are created
by combining extracts from multiple cannabis strains, a process known as “Frankensteining.” Some
believe Frankenstein formulations are less effective than formulations developed from a single strain
because the natural balance of compounds in a single strain translates to a naturally balanced effect on
the human body.

An understanding of entourage effects and how to effectively combine cannabinoids and terpenes
is believed to be critical to the development of targeted cannabis therapies. Examples of cannabis-based
therapies being developed with specific cannabinoid-terpene profiles include acne medication contain-
ing CBD and limonene, linalool and pinene; antiseptic agents containing CBG and pinene; treatments

Practical Tips to Reduce FCPA Risk in Mergers and Acquisitions

Companies pursuing mergers or acquisitions can take certain steps to identify and potentially reduce FCPA risks:

M&A Opinion Procedure Release Requests: One option is to seek an opinion from DOJ in anticipation of a
potential acquisition, such as occurred with Opinion Release 08-02. That case involved special circumstances,
namely, severely limited pre-acquisition due diligence available to the potential acquiring company, and, because
it was an opinion release (i.e., providing certain assurances by DOJ concerning prospective conduct), it necessarily
imposed demanding standards and prescriptive timeframes in return for specific assurances from DOJ, which
SEC, as a matter of discretion, also honors. Thus, obtaining an opinion from DOJ can be a good way to address
specific due diligence challenges, but, because of the nature of such an opinion, it will likely contain more stringent
requirements than may be necessary in all circumstances.

M&A Risk-Based FCPA Due Diligence and Disclosure: As a practical matter, most acquisitions will typically not
require the type of prospective assurances contained in an opinion from DOJ. DOJ and SEC encourage companies
engaging in mergers and acquisitions to: (1) conduct thorough risk-based FCPA and anti-corruption due diligence
on potential new business acquisitions; (2) ensure that the acquiring company’s code of conduct and compliance
policies and procedures regarding the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws apply as quickly as is practicable to
newly acquired businesses or merged entities; (3) train the directors, officers, and employees of newly acquired
businesses or merged entities, and when appropriate, train agents and business partners, on the FCPA and other
relevant anti-corruption laws and the company’s code of conduct and compliance policies and procedures; (4)
conduct an FCPA-specific audit of all newly acquired or merged businesses as quickly as practicable; and (5) disclose
any corrupt payments discovered as part of its due diligence of newly acquired entities or merged entities. DOJ
and SEC will give meaningful credit to companies who undertake these actions, and, in appropriate circumstances,
DOJ and SEC may consequently decline to bring enforcement actions.

bribery—both the new entity and the foreign subsidiaries
were liable under the FCPA. The new parent entered into
a non-prosecution agreement with DOJ and settled a civil
action with SEC, while the company’s subsidiaries, which
also merged, pleaded guilty.'*

More often, DOJ and SEC have pursued enforce-
ment actions against the predecessor company (rather
than the acquiring company), particularly when the
acquiring company uncovered and timely remedied the
violations or when the government’s investigation of
the predecessor company preceded the acquisition. In
one such case, an Ohio-based health care company’s due
diligence of an acquisition target uncovered FCPA vio-
lations by the target’s subsidiary, and, before the merger
was completed, the subsidiary’s violations were disclosed
to DOJ and SEC. The subsidiary pleaded guilty and

paid a $2 million criminal fine,

the acquisition target

and no successor liability was sought against the acquir-
ing entity. In another case, a Pennsylvania-based issuer
that supplied heating and air conditioning products and
services was subject to an ongoing investigation by DOJ
and SEC at the time that it was acquired; DOJ and SEC
resolved enforcement actions only against the predecessor
company, which had by that time become a wholly owned
subsidiary of the successor company..”!

DOJand SEC have also brought actions only against a
predecessor company where its FCPA violations are discov-
ered after acquisition. For example, when a Florida-based
US. company discovered in post-acquisition due diligence
that the telecommunications company (a domestic con-
cern) it had acquired had engaged in foreign bribery, the
successor company disclosed the FCPA violations to DOJ.
It then conducted an internal investigation, cooperated
fully with DOJ, and took appropriate remedial action—

including terminating senior management at the acquired

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018401.txt,"I said earlier that | wanted to lay the Seventh Sense onto the problems of war and
peace and grand strategy - and while the insights our new instinct reveals are life-
giving for business and eye-opening for culture, it’s to the devious and unavoidable
problem of global order I want to turn now. In a now-famous 1986 speech “You and
Your Research”, the Bell Labs scientist Richard Hamming set three questions for
anyone embarked on the exploration of new ideas: “1. What are the most important
problems in your field? 2. Are you working on one of them? 3. Why not?”2*° Well, the
most important problem in the field of global affairs is the question of the future of
world order, of how it will emerge - and what sort of aspect it may yet present. It is
the problem to be working on. It also touches, like it or not, whatever the most
important problem in your field is: Opening new markets, educating your kids,
planning five years of corporate growth. Remember the distinction from earlier in
the book, the difference between living at an ordinary moment and an historic one?
The difference between Warsaw in 1539 and 1939? In one age, history is irrelevant;
in the other it nearly throttles you. You can’t avoid being touched. We live in an
historic era, not least because the connections that define our age means epochal
quakes in one part of the system will rattle other bits too.

A feeling for history — Nietzche’s old “Sixth Sense” - should fire up invisibly in us bit
now as we think about what life in an historic age might mean for us. The surprises
in our news every day. The creaking of our old institutions. What do they augur? The
political scientists Charles S. Gochman and Zeev Maoz once made a survey of history
to see if they could spot just when the world slipped from calm moments to
epochally unettled ones. They surveyed nearly 1,000 wars, big and small, hunting
for patterns as you or! might look for trends in stock prices or sports scores.
Increasing complexity, they discovered, almost always shook the world into conflict.
States, armies, political groups, newly independent nations, ideological and religious
forces emerge and then collide in their young energy, each driven by different aims
and values and dreams. A cycle marks the process. First, disputes over small matters
accelerate — as they are doing now. Everything seems open to question: Do you
control this trade route? Who says we have to respect this arms limit? The
combined pressure of so many simultaneous disagreements announces a shift in the
pattern of all relations. A logical loop follows: “The frequency of disputes,” Gochman
and Moaz explain, “appears to be an early indicator of system transformation...The
rise in the number of disputes seems to indicate a decline in the degree of consensus
on the ‘rules’ of the international order. This heightened dissensus (often
culminating in large-scale wars) is followed by restructuring.”**! Pressure on the
rules. Small cracks. Large scale war. Re-ordering. Like water moving from ice to
liquid to steam and back, this cycle has a predictable logic. It ran in the age of
Bismarck and culminated in World War One. It spun again in the age between last
century’s great wars too, tripping into a second World War. And it ran as well in the

Furthermore, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure already direct executive branch actions less directly connected to court
hearings. For instance, Rule 16 directs that prosecutors must turn over various discoverable items to the defendant. '47 Rule 41
directs federal agents serving a warrant to leave a copy for the person whose premises are searched. !4% And, most
controversially, Rule 5 directs that federal agents making an arrest must take the defendant without unnecessary delay before
a judicial officer. '49 The kinds of rule changes discussed in this Article are far less invasive than these commands. Finally, it
should be remembered that federal prosecutors serve as officers of the court. !°° In that capacity, the court can be reasonably
expected to facilitate victims’ involvement in the criminal justice process. !°! For all of these reasons, this proposed rule breaks
no new ground in directing prosecutors to notify victims of courtroom proceedings.

Rule 11(a)(3) - Victims’ Views on Nolo Contendere Pleas
The Proposal:

Rule 11's procedures on pleas should be revised to allow victims to express their views on any plea of nolo contendere before
the court decides whether to accept it as follows:
[*866]

(a)(3) Nolo Contendere Plea. Before accepting a plea of nolo contendere, the court must consider the parties’ and victims’ views
and the public interest in the effective administration of justice.

The Rationale:

As discussed at greater length in the immediately following sections, the CVRA gives victims the right to be heard regarding
any plea, presumably including any nolo contendere plea. It is a natural corollary that the court should consider the victim's
views before accepting any such plea.

Rule 11(b)(4) - Victims' Right To Be Heard on Pleas
The Proposal:

The court should address any victim present in court when taking a plea in order to determine whether the victim wishes to
make a statement and to consider the victim's view before accepting a plea as follows:

(4)[cfn ]Victims’ Views. Before the court accepts a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or allows any plea to be withdrawn, the
court must address any victim who is present personally in open court. During this address, the court must determine whether
the victim wishes to present views regarding the proposed plea or withdrawal and, if so, what those views are. The court shall
consider the victim's views in acting on the proposed plea or withdrawal.

The Rationale:

The CVRA gives victims the right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving ... [a] plea.
'S2 Many states afford victims similar rights. !°? The rationale for a [*867] victim's right to be heard regarding a plea is to

Businesses may reduce the FCPA risks associated
with third-party agents by implementing an effective com-
pliance program, which includes due diligence of any pro-

spective foreign agents.

United States v. Kozeny, et al.

In December 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit upheld a conscious avoidance
instruction given during the 2009 trial of a businessman
who was convicted of conspiring to violate the FCPA’s
anti-bribery provisions by agreeing to make payments to
Azeri officials in a scheme to encourage the privatization
of the Azerbaijan Republic’s state oil company. The
court of appeals found that the instruction did not lack
a factual predicate, citing evidence and testimony at
trial demonstrating that the defendant knew corruption
was pervasive in Azerbaijan; that he was aware of his
business partner’s reputation for misconduct; that he
had created two U.S. companies in order to shield
himself and other investors from potential liability for
payments made in violation of the FCPA; and that the
defendant expressed concerns during a conference call
about whether his business partner and company were
bribing officials.

The court of appeals also rejected the defendant's
contention that the conscious avoidance charge had
improperly permitted the jury to convict him based on
negligence, explaining that ample evidence in the record
showed that the defendant had “serious concerns”
about the legality of his partner’s business practices
“and worked to avoid learning exactly what [he] was
doing,” and noting that the district court had specifically
instructed the jury not to convict based on negligence.

What Affirmative Defenses Are
Available?

The FCPA’ anti-bribery provisions contain two affir-
mative defenses: (1) that the payment was lawful under the
written laws of the foreign country (the “local law” defense),
and (2) that the money was spent as part of demonstrating a
product or performing a contractual obligation (the “reason-
able and bona fide business expenditure” defense). Because
these are affirmative defenses, the defendant bears the burden

of proving them.

The Local Law Defense

For the local law defense to apply, a defendant must
establish that “the payment, gift, offer, or promise of any-
thing of value that was made, was lawful under the writ-
ten laws and regulations of the foreign official’s, political
party’s, party official's, or candidate’s country.’“! The defen-
dant must establish that the payment was lawful under the
foreign country’s written laws and regulations at the time
of the offense. In creating the local law defense in 1988,
Congress sought “to make clear that the absence of written
laws in a foreign official’s country would not by itself be suf
ficient to satisfy this defense.” Thus, the fact that bribes
may not be prosecuted under local law is insufficient to
establish the defense. In practice, the local law defense arises
infrequently, as the written laws and regulations of coun-
tries rarely, if ever, permit corrupt payments. Nevertheless,
if a defendant can establish that conduct that otherwise
falls within the scope of the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions
was lawful under written, local law, he or she would have a
defense to prosecution.

In United States v. Kozeny, the defendant unsuccess-
fully sought to assert the local law defense regarding the law
of Azerbaijan. The parties disputed the contents and appli-
cability of Azeri law, and each presented expert reports and
testimony on behalf of their conflicting interpretations. The
court ruled that the defendant could not invoke the FCPA’s
affirmative defense because Azeri law did not actually legal-
ize the bribe payment. The court concluded that an excep-

tion under Azeri law relieving bribe payors who voluntarily

Ina high profile case, my client was asked to submit to an FBI interview at their offices in North Miami
Beach.

Feigning naivety, I asked where the court reporter was. I was told there was no court reporter.
I then asked where the tape recorder was.

I will always be impressed that the agent was able to give us the response he did without laughing. He
said the FBI could not tape the interview because they did not have enough money in their budget.

_Itwas time to play the Trump Card.

At that point, I removed a cassette recorder from my pocket and explained that my client had been able
to scrape together the 59 cents for a cassette tape. Further we would pay for the lape to be transcribed
and supply them with 4 free copy of everything.

You could've heard a fart in a vacuum.

They now made it clear that no way, no how would any FBI interview be recorded. So we went forward
with the interview as the agent took notes.

Months later the client was called to testify at trial.
I warned him the 302 would be a work of fiction. It was. I was sitting in the back of the courtroom. -

Called to the stand; he told the real truth and not the 302 version of the truth. The Assistant US.
Attorney was frustrated and kept on confronting him with the 302 version.

Fed up with the prosecutor and in the presence of the jury, the witness preceded to recount my debate
over recording from the first interview. Pointing to me in the back of the courtroom, the witness
announced that I had warned him that they would pull this crap with the 302 report.

It didn't take the jury very long to acquit.

With the advent of DNA and groups like the Innocence Project, we have now seen that so-called
unrecorded confessions have put many innocent people in jail and even on Death Row. As a resuit,
agencies such as the BSO, now require all interviews to be taped.

But not the FBI. .

Like anyone, including lawyers, the FBI wants to control the record of the interview. Taping hurts that
effort. ©

I'm not saying that it is FBI policy to step over the line. But they have chalk on their shoes more often
than you can imagine.

MSCI EM (27 June): 913 (last month: 907)
UBS View MSCI EM 6-month target: 1,000
¢ Currency weakness hurt emerging market (EM) equity performance in US-dollar terms year-to-date. We
expect EM FX to appreciate against the USD from current levels over a six-month horizon.
e As expected, China has started to ease monetary policy. We believe there is also room to do more on the
fiscal side, helping to support China's economic growth outlook for the second half of 2012 and into 2013.
The 2Q GDP numbers are expected to represent the low point in the current cycle.
¢ Given the above, in our base case, we see scope for some multiple expansion for the MSCI EM Index,
from the current 10.3x realized price-to-earnings ratio to closer to 11x over the next six months. We expect
earnings growth of around 10% over the next 12 months.
¢ Within EM, we believe that Asia is best positioned for economic growth in the second half of 2012. In
emerging Asia, we prefer China. In Latin America, we prefer Brazil and Mexico. Central and Eastern
Europe remains the most vulnerable region, and we remain neutral on Russia.
4 Positive scenario MSCI EM (6-month target): 1,190
e The outlook for the global economy improves, boosting EM's ability to grow more strongly in 2013.
Stronger economic growth leads to earnings growth of 15%. Investor confidence improves, leading to a
better P/E multiple of 12.5x trailing earnings. More cyclical Korea and Taiwan would benefit.

& Negative scenario MSCI EM (6-month target): 730

e Serious negative developments (e.g. a further deterioration of the Eurozone crisis, the US fiscal cliff, or a
Chinese hard landing) hit trade and thus the economic prospects of emerging markets. In this case, we
would expect a 25% decline in earnings. More defensive Malaysia would do better, whereas more cyclical
Korea and Taiwan would underperform. We assume, however, that the market would also be expecting
some recovery in earnings for 2013, helping the P/E multiple to recover to 9.5x trailing earnings.

Upside Scenario

Starting with the framework laid out above, we make several key
adjustments in our upside scenario to illustrate where we think mul-
tiples go and where the stocks can trade over the near term if the alts
convert. Our upside scenario implies an average share price increase

of 13% across the group.

e First we fully tax effect the performance fee earnings.
Under a C-corp structure these would not get the pass-
through benefit and would be subject to full taxes. We use a
full 24% tax drag on the net accrued carry receivable balance
and the future net carry per share.

e@ Second we adjust the FRE multiples upward. As we dis-
cussed previously with our three approaches for FREmulti-
ples, we believe there is significant upside to the value of
these earnings if alts were to convert. This drives nearly all of
the upside from current prices in our upside scenario. We use
a 22.5x multiple on FRE in our upside case, which represents

50% increase from the 15x multiple that we believe is priced

in today.

e Last we assume 2x of multiple expansion for performance

fees. As a starting point, we look at the implied multiples
using current share prices and a 15x multiple for FRE as
described above. We then add 2x turns of multiple expansion
to each of the companies@urrent implied multiples. We look
to the Goldman Sachs example earlier in the note as a comp
for cyclical financials earnings. Our group median for implied
future carry multiples of 8.5x is just under one standard devi-
ation away from GS@historical P/E average of 9.5x. Although
we use the higher multiple, this is on a lower value of fully
taxed future performance fee earnings. The impact to valua-
tion of future performance fees are mixed from company and
can be seen in greater detail in the following appendix with
company specific SOTP and scenario analysis. While we
expect some multiple expansion for performance fees ina
C-corp, the structure will not change the inherent vola-
tility of the performance fee portion of earnings that is

marked to market.

equilibrium. After all, if we were constantly tearing into one another, we'd be
extinct, not evolved. Why did cities form? Nations? The key is a moment when
shared, possibly devastating risk of collective failure becomes apparent - those
moments when the whole system threatens to collapse right on top of all the
participants. The greater the shared danger, Mezza-Garcia and her colleagues
explain, the better the chance for real cooperation. It’s a forumula that fits what we
face now: “An increased risk of collective failure facilitates large-scale cooperation,
especially when the large scale system is composed of smaller, nested groups,” They
explain. ““Complex systems theory reveals an alternative to constant conflict.”

This is our world now: Linked clusters of markets, nations, machines - all exposed
to arisk of shared and instant collective failure. Such a structure upends an axiom of
politics that has run for centuries: Man is purely Darwinian and that survival is
determined by constant competition alone. In a network, survival is determined by
sociability, by cooperation. Linked systems drive people to agree on rules in order to
participate, which accelerates change and co-evolution. Smart cancer databases,
linked traffic systems, video platforms like YouTube - each are Gatelands that press
users together on a single platform, one that can be instantly updated and
constantly studied for adjustment. “Rich get richer” arrangements are an ideal place
for co-evolution, shaped as they are by easy linkage, exchange and connection to
outside events. As more people follow the logic inside the gates, the system co-
evolves. It becomes still more fit. It’s this loop that makes Hard Gatekeeping so well
suited to an age of connection. We’re not merely putting up walls; gatelands are like
markets or public squares. They are loci for cooperation. In diplomatic history it’s
not hard to calls for cooperation. “We must get along or this war will devastate us
all!” But they don't work. Mostly you find hand-wringing about how terrible war
would be followed by, well, war. The logic of networks offers an escape from this sad
habit.

Co-evolving relations between the US and China can begin at the most obvious of
starting points: Both sides need to change. New pressures are already tearing at
each. Both nations need a new gatekept system. Our aim isn’t to “balance” China into
some sort of frozen checkmate. It’s not to tip her unwisely into chaotic and
impoverished domestic order - we are, like it or not, all connected. It is to co-evolve
together. And China? She won’t survive if she does not connect to a system that is
congenial to her needs. Fortunately, the networks are infinitely flexible in their
design. A Chinese model and an American model pose no problem of
interoperability. This is the best co-evolutionary strategy for each side. The dangers
we confront now are everywhere. The habitual American temptation is to break all
these risks into pieces, to find out where the problem is, and to flatten each of them:
“Let’s hit the terrorists, then the Chinese navy, then the Russians, then the drug
lords.” This will kill us if we keep it up. In a complex system, piecemeal attack
simply shocks the system to still greater complexity. The world, rather wonderfully,
is too flexible for brute force applied at one place. A dynamic defense, is a precursor

such conclusion would be contrary to the plain language of the CVRA. |!° To avoid possible confusion, the rules should be
clear on this point.

An additional reason for integrating victims into the federal rules is that Congress seemingly expects this to happen. Congress
adopted the CVRA with the express goal of making the new law a formula [*855] for success and a model for our States.
111 Congress clearly wants the new law aggressively implemented, thereby avoiding the need for further legislative action or
even, possibly, a federal constitutional amendment. Congress is watching to see whether the Judiciary (and the Executive) will
fully and fairly implement this new Act. As Senator Leahy warned, Passage of this bill will necessitate careful oversight of its
implementation by Congress. 1!

Construing the CVRA to require changes is also appropriate because the Act is remedial legislation. As the Supreme Court has
instructed, When Congress uses broad generalized language in a remedial statute, and that language is not contravened by
authoritative legislative history, a court should interpret the provision generously so as to effectuate the important congressional
goals. !!3 The congressional sponsors described the victims’ rights in the CVRA as broad rights, !!4 the significance of
which should not be whittled down or marginalized by the courts or the executive branch. This legislation is meant to correct,
not continue, the legacy of the poor treatment of crime victims in the criminal process. !!>

A final reason for amending the rules is that crime victims’ groups are looking for the effective implementation of the CVRA.
They are urging that the federal rules be comprehensively amended to reflect victims’ rights; indeed, they have even suggested
that Congress should directly amend the federal rules to include victims’ rights. !!© The Judiciary would be well advised not to
ignore these lobbying efforts. Victims have proven very effective at advancing legislation in Congress, particularly where they
have legitimate grievances about how they have been treated. !!7

Moreover, allowing the initiative for drafting of rules to pass from the Judiciary to Congress is not ideal. The Advisory
Committee on Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure includes many skilled [*856] members with considerable experience in
drafting rules. The Committee is well aware of the CVRA. Shortly after the passage of the CVRA, the Committee withdrew a

118

modest victim amendment it was proposing in anticipation of the need to make more extensive changes, and is already

working on proposed amendments to the rules. |!° It is preferable to have victims integrated into the federal rules through
careful drafting by the Committee rather than by the potentially blunderbuss approach of direct congressional action.

For all these reasons, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure should be comprehensively amended to recognize the interests
of crime victims and thereby to allow victims to be full participants in the criminal process.

Swiss Accounts Survey 
Dear Mr Epstein, 
We are writing because a US media organisation, in concert with ourselves at the Guardian newspaper in 
London, is currently conducting a detailed survey of Swiss bank accounts, past and present. 
It is not illegal to have Swiss accounts. But as you may know, it is a topic of considerable public debate, and 
several governments have been investigating the owners of such accounts. 
There are a number of ways such accounts and also offshore trusts have been used to avoid inheritance tax, 
UK domestic tax, or tax imposed by other countries. Such accounts have also been used to launder money. 
We have seen records held in the US identifying you among those who have held accounts. These accounts

We will be particularly concerned with these questions: 
2) Why you had Swiss accounts. 
3) How much back tax you have settled with the tax authorities following their investigation of your affairs. 
Additionally, from public records and from material we have seen we note that:

4) In 2008 you pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution and procuring minors for prostitution. You were 
sentenced to 18 months in prison. 
5) Your above accounts were also linked with Mr Leslie Wexner. 
6) You are known to be or have previously been closely associated with Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew and Kevin 
Spacey. 
7) You have made substantial contributions to the Clintons' philanthropic causes. Tax reform campaigners 
have previously been critical of those who engage in public life or the political process while avoiding or 
evading tax. Hilary Clinton herself, speaking in 2012, noted the importance of elites paying a substantial share 
of tax: One of the issues that I have been preaching about around the world is collecting taxes in an 
equitable manner — especially from the elites in every country. 
It is intended shortly to publish the results of our survey in both the US and the UK.

TIIC Group backed by Edmond de Rothschild, is a pan-European infrastructure firm advising on mid-market
infrastructure projects across Europe in both the transportation and social sectors. It was established in 2008
by the 3 founding partners of TIIC Group, Jaime d’Almeida, Manuel Cary and Francisco Mendes, with strategic
support from the Edmond de Rothschild Group and Brisa.

The aim of TIIC Group is to bring an operational approach to infrastructure investments in Europe, drawing
upon the extensive management and financial skills of its team members. These skills have been developed
over many years at some of Europe’s leading infrastructure operators and project financing firms which,
when combined with the very specific infrastructure expertise of both the Edmond de Rothschild Group and
Brisa, makes for a powerful and differentiated investment platform.

TIIC Group operates from two offices in Lisbon and Paris, providing its team with access to relevant
investment opportunities across key target markets in Europe as well as to leading industrial contractors,
operators, advisors and financiers in the infrastructure industry.

TIIC Group successfully raised a First Fund with €140m of commitments targeting transportation investments
across Europe. The portfolio of the First Fund comprises 6 assets located in Portugal, Spain, France and
Poland. They represent a carefully balanced mix of greenfield and early stage brownfield projects in roads
and car parks. TIIC Group has played an active role in the sourcing and development of all investments and
has made a significant contribution to value creation. TIIC Group believes that this is a high quality,
operationally secure, cash yielding portfolio of assets which will be of strong interest to potential investors
over the coming few years.

TIIC has launched a successor fund, TIIC 2, which will build upon TIIC Group’ differentiated approach to
infrastructure in Europe. TIIC 2 will is targeting aggregate commitments from investors of €300m (€350m
hard cap) to invest into both transportation and social infrastructure projects in Europe. TIIC 2 will also seek
to invest, ona very selective basis, into greenfield social infrastructure projects in New Frontier Markets,
within close proximity to the European Union. Given its powerful network of relationships across Europe and
the operational skills of its team, TIIC Group will continue to target superior investment returns for TIIC 2’s
portfolio of assets. These returns should be in line with the anticipated returns from the First Fund portfolio
which is forecast to deliver a gross IRR of up to 14% and a multiple of approximately 2x on invested capital.

TIIC announced the first close of TIIC 2 on December 30 2016, with aggregate commitments of €135m from
a group of high quality and well-diversified limited partners. First close investors in TIIC 2 include the
European Investment Bank and Edmond de Rothschild, both with significant commitments, as well as the

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019424.txt,"cost of medical supplies from gauze to heart implants, disappears into an opaque realm of byzantine contracts, confidential
rebates and fees that would be considered illegal kickbacks in many other industries.

IV bags can function like cheap milk and eggs in a high-priced grocery store, or like the one-cent cellphone locked into an
expensive service contract. They serve as loss leaders in exclusive contracts with “preferred manufacturers” that bundle
together expensive drugs and basics, or throw in “free” medical equipment with costly consequences.

Few hospitals negotiate these deals themselves. Instead, they rely on two formidable sets of middlemen: a few giant group-
purchasing organizations that negotiate high-volume contracts, and a few giant distributors that buy and store medical
supplies and deliver them to client hospitals.

Proponents of this system say it saves hospitals billions in economies of scale. Critics say the middlemen not only take their
cut, but they have a strong interest in keeping most prices high and competition minimal.

The top three group-purchasing organizations now handle contracts for more than half of all institutional medical supplies
sold in the United States, including the IVs used in the food-poisoning case, which were bought and taken by truck to
regional warehouses by big distributors.

These contracts proved to be another black box. Debbie Mitchell, a spokeswoman for Cardinal Health, one of the three
largest distributors, said she could not discuss costs or prices under “disclosure rules relative to our investor relations.”

Distributors match different confidential prices for the same product with each hospital’s contract, she said, and sell
information about the buyers back to manufacturers.

A huge Cardinal distribution center is in Montgomery, N.Y. — only 30 miles, as it happens, from the landscaped grounds of
the Buddhist monastery in Carmel, N.Y., where many of the food-poisoning victims fell illon Mother’s Day 2012.

Among them were families on 10 tour buses that had left Chinatown in Manhattan that morning to watch dragon dances at
the monastery. After eating lunch from food stalls there, some traveled on to the designer outlet stores at Woodbury
Commons, about 30 miles away, before falling sick.

The symptoms were vicious. “Within two hours of eating that rice that | had bought, | was lying on the ground barely
conscious,” said Dr. Elizabeth Frost, 73, an anesthesiologist from Purchase in Westchester County who was visiting the
monastery gardens with two friends. “I can’t believe no one died.”

About 100 people were taken to hospitals in the region by ambulance; 5 were admitted and the rest released the same day.
The New York State Department of Health later found the cause was a common bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus, from
improperly cooked or stored food sold in the stalls.

MYSTERIOUS CHARGES
The sick entered a health care ecosystem under strain, swept by consolidation and past efforts at cost containment.

For more than a decade, hospitals in the Hudson Valley, like those across the country, have scrambled for mergers and
alliances to offset economic pressures from all sides. The five hospitals where most of the victims were treated are all part of
merged entities jockeying for bargaining power and market share — or worrying that other players will leave them struggling
to survive.

The Affordable Care Act encourages these developments as it drives toward a reimbursement system that strives to keep
people out of hospitals through more coordinated, cost-efficient care paid on the basis of results, not services. But the billing
mysteries in the food poisoning case show how easily cost-cutting can turn into cost-shifting.

A Chinese-American toddler from Brooklyn and her 56-year-old grandmother, treated and released within hours from the
emergency room at St. Luke’s Cornwall Hospital, ran up charges of more than $4,000 and were billed for $1,400 — the
hospital’s rate for the uninsured, even though the family is covered by a health maintenance organization under Medicaid,
the federal-state program for poor people.

iL.

In the Spring of 2009 (approximately April), I joined the law firm of Rothstein,
Rosenfeldt and Adler, P.A. (“RRA”). I brought my existing clients with me when I
joined RRA, including MMB, and Jane Doe. When I joined the firm, I was not
aware that Scott Rothstein was running a Ponzi scheme at RRA. Had I known such a
Ponzi scheme was in place, I would never have joined RRA.

I am now aware that it has been alleged that Scott Rothstein made fraudulent
presentations to investors about the lawsuits that I had filed on behalf of my clients
against Epstein and that it has been alleged that these lawsuits were used to fraudulently
lure investors into Rothstein’s Ponzi scheme. I never met a single investor, had no part
in any such presentations and had no knowledge any such fraud was occurring. If these
allegations are true, I had no knowledge that any such fraudulent presentations were
occurring and no knowledge of any such improper use of the case files.

Epstein’s Complaint against me alleges that Rothstein made false statements about
cases filed against Epstein, i.e., that RRA had 50 anonymous females who had filed suit
against Epstein; that Rothstein sold an interest in personal injury lawsuits, reached
agreements to share attorneys fees with non-lawyers, paid clients “up front” money; and
that he used the judicial process to further his Ponzi scheme. If Rothstein did any of
these things, I had no knowledge of his actions. Because I maintained close contact
with my clients, Hj HMM and Jane Doe, and Scott Rothstein never met any of them, I
know for certain that none of my clients were paid “up front” money by anyone.

Epstein alleges that I attempted to take the depositions of his “high profile friends and
acquaintances” for no legitimate litigation purpose. This is untrue, as all of my actions
in representing H., MM, and Jane Doe were aimed at providing them effective
representation in their civil suits. With regard to Epstein’s friends, through documents
and information obtained in discovery and other means of investigation, I learned that
Epstein was sexually molesting minor girls on a daily basis and had been for many
years. I also learned the unsurprising fact that he was molesting the girls in the privacy
of his mansion in West Palm Beach, meaning that locating witnesses to corroborate
their testimony would be difficult to find. I also learned, from the course of the
litigation, that Epstein and his lawyers were constantly attacking the credibility of the
girls, that Epstein’s employees were all represented by lawyers who apparently were
paid for (directly or indirectly) by Epstein, that co-conspirators whose representation
was also apparently paid for by Epstein were all taking the Fifth (like Epstein) rather
than provide information in discovery. For example, I was given reason to believe that

Larry Visoski, Larry Harrison, David Rogers, Louella Rabuyo,
ME, Ghislaine Maxwell, Mark Epstein, and Janusz Banasiak all had lawyers
paid for by Epstein. Because Epstein and the co-conspirators in his child molestation
criminal enterprise blocked normal discovery avenues, I needed to search for other
ordinary approaches to strengthen the cases of my clients. Consistent with my training
and experience, these other ordinary approaches included finding other witnesses who
could corroborate allegations of sexual abuse of my clients or other girls. Some of these
witnesses were friends of Epstein. Given his social status, it also turned out that some
of his friends were high-profile individuals.

intentions and emotions of others, and often become hyper-aroused when seeing, hearing, or touching
rather unremarkable objects or events. All of these capacities require a system that can integrate multiple
sources of information. During brain scanning, individuals with autism show a striking reduction in
activity in an area called the insula and its connection to both the somatosensory cortex and amygdala.
The insula is an area of the brain that is like a traffic cop, responsible for coordinating the flow of
information in the brain, both where it is coming from and where it should go. The somatosensory cortex
handles our body’s response to the world, including its state of arousal. The amygdala plays a key role in
emotional processing, and more generally, in generating positive or negative assessments about the value
of an experience. With the traffic cop asleep, and the body’s arousal and emotional hubs dormant, it is no
wonder that those with autism lack empathy, can’t understand what it means for someone to be in love,
are befuddled by deception, and find the bombardment from our media-intense world truly
overwhelming. The lack of connectivity among those with autism is proof that connectivity is necessary
for promiscuous thinking.

Once we evolved our massively connected, promiscuous brain, tool use, communication,
mathematics, music, and morality were transformed. No longer were we constrained to think within the
confines of the evolved context. We could take aspects of an ancient psychology that evolved for one
problem and use it for new purposes, some beneficial to us individually and as members of a group, and
some costly to our own and others’ survival.

Consider our capacity to defend members within a group against attack from individuals outside
the group. Many, perhaps even the majority of religious groups have carried out this mission, some with
violence such as the Catholic-Protestant conflict in Ireland, and some with tranquility such as the
Tibetan’s plea for peace amidst a powerful Chinese oppressor. The process starts, however, with an
ancient system that we share with all socially living animals. To survive and reproduce, individuals
cooperate with members of their own group and defend their resources against members of neighboring
groups. All animals, humans included, recognize group members by distinctive markings or recalling
features associated with specific individuals. We transformed this evolutionarily ancient capacity into a
distinctively human one by combining it with our systems of language, morality, and beliefs. This
combination allows us to use symbols to demarcate those within our group from those outside, to tie these
symbols to distinctive beliefs, values, and emotions, and to use these different psychological systems to
caricature the other as buffoon, vermin, parasite, or inanimate cargo. This combinatorial process allows
us to cleanse the in-group by annihilating the out-group. It allows us to increase cooperation within a
group while ramping up the defenses to take out enemies living outside the group. This strategy is

simple and effective. First, convince one group of people that another group has a set of undesirable traits,

NTP helps increase penetration of higher margin offerings
We believe the National Transformation Plan will herald significant change for the Saudi
telecom sector over the next five years. In particular, its focus on increasing access to
high speed internet (via wireless and fibre) should underpin a material uplift in data
usage and broadband penetration levels. Given these offerings represent the highest
margin services provided by the telecom service providers, we believe the move towards
a more data intensive society should be supportive for industry margins. Furthermore,
with the NTP’s plans relying heavily on private sector investment (including STC), we
believe it could accelerate the spin out of tower portfolios from the three telecom
players in the Kingdom (as a way of raising financing).

Government investment set to exceed US$2bn

As part of the National transformation plan, the government is seeking to invest more
than US$2bn in the expansion of wireless (3G & 4G) and fibre infrastructure (FTTH)
across the kingdom. Whilst the finer details on how this expenditure will be deployed
(e.g. via grants or via direct investments?) have yet to be disclosed, details of the NTP
suggest it will be used to expand connectivity in the remote areas of Saudi Arabia (given
the telecom companies have largely avoided such expenditure in the past given low
returns), as well as increasing network density in developed and urban areas.

Spectrum increases an indication of ambitious growth

The government is also looking to significantly enhance the availability of spectrum to
the telecom industry (from 42% to 80% of total spectrum allocated), highlighting the
expected surge in data usage in the Kingdom to 2020 and beyond. Whilst data usage in
the Kingdom has been rapidly growing in recent years on the back of high speed rollouts
(3G & LTE), demand still lags global and regional averages (as indicated by data as a
percentage of total mobile revenues). Ultimately, we believe this will have a number of
effects including: (1) Saudi Arabia will further increase its focus on high speed offerings,
(LTE/LTEA and eventually 5G); (2) capex cycles will likely lengthen as telecom companies
intensify their rollout of coverage; and, (3) tower density will likely have to increase
across the key demand centres.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018373.txt,"The computing programming technology that lingers inside most data centers now
and that makes sense of the ceaselessly arriving bits - Here is information on a
billion people. How many are named Bob? - is known as MapReduce. The name
combines two well-know computer fuctions, Map and Reduce, and it is just the sort
of program Janelle and Hillis would have dreamed up, had they ever met.
MapReduce divides computation work among thousands of machines, just the sort
of massive parallelism Hilli had in mind. What it implicitly does, however, is crunch
what might have taken years into microseconds. If the charmed phrase of James’
stately Victorian elites more than a century ago was “Summer Afternoon,” ours
might be “MapReduce”, a kind of magic two word code for a whole way of living and
thinking.

The most successful political and economic systems of the past, the ones that
marked the winning “convergence” club of humanity’s last great leap, let people
liberate themselves into a life of their dreams. Liberty meant tearing down old
barriers to influence and security and knowledge; tipping over the Bastille, escaping
colonialism. And it meant, too, providing a scaffolding of education, of social
support, of laws and stability for citizens. The industrial, urban and rich countries
that populate our world now evolved that way because their citizens made them so.
They escaped the tyranny of the pre-modern, of a world where the small town you
were born in and the pattern of your parents’ life were a kind of prision for your
hopes. This was the whole trick of the Enlightenment, after all: What do you want to
be? You decide! What do you want your nation to be? Decide that too. Dare to know!

Look ahead now. The very best future political and economic arrangements will
need to do something more than simply liberate us. They will have to enable and
permit citizens to compress time. Just as the idea of a democracy was shocking once,
this concept of a system tuned not merely for liberty but for compression of time
should rattle us a bit. Certainly the attempt to achieve such an aim, to build the
scaffolds and rails a time compressed world demands, will jostle much of what
existst now. But to be modern means, in essence, the right, the ability to engage in
compression. Nations or corporations or ideologies that can deliver this liberty of
velocity - and that can construct and manage the flat-out fast, networked, artificially
topologies such a life demands - will grow, thrive, accelerate even faster. The others,
slowed by history or blocked by social or ideological designs, will miss the turn.
They will be the new divergence club. Fast networks will elude them. Self-defense
will be impossible; their time will be as vulnerable to easy manipulation and attack
as the resources of China and Africa and Latin America were in the face of greedy
colonialist plunder several hundred years ago.

There is no equality of justice between the weak and the strong, the Italian historian
Giambattista Vico once noted. So in our age. Between the fast and the slow? No

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021303.txt,"The Mind and Body Are One

The Cartesian view of the mind
as distinct from the body persists in
twenty-first century discourse as the
mind-body problem alluded to by Gary
Berntson. Berntson provides evidence
that the mind and the body, psychology
and physiology, are not independent of
each other but represent different levels
of organization of human organisms.
Beliefs influence thoughts, behaviors,
and physiology, and peripheral
physiological processes signal central
neural networks that influence
cognitions and feelings crucial for the
generation and moderation of beliefs.
Spiritual beliefs are considered by some
to be contentious candidates for
scientific examination, yet Berntson
argues that spiritual beliefs can be
identified, measured, and subjected to
scientific investigation in the same
fashion as any other belief or invisible
force. Accordingly, Berntson examines
the effects of a specific spiritual belief —
the belief that one has a close personal
relationship with God. As documented
by Berntson, this belief is associated
with rather profound physiological and
health effects.

Whereas Berntson focuses on the
influence of the mind on the body and
vice versa, Giin Semin speaks of the
mind in the body and, more specifically,
in several bodies simultaneously. In his
social cognition model, Semin
challenges the limits of individual social
cognition and argues that regulation and
co-regulation of social behavior are
distributed across brains. When several
individuals exhibit spontaneous
synchronized behaviors (e.g., hand-
clapping), the human tendency is to
invoke a “supra-individual” explanation.
Semin describes a mechanism by which

Page |57

the supra-individual source can be
explained as shared motor
representations and ongoing monitoring
of observed actions that, under certain
conditions, lead to dissolution of the
boundary between self and other. The
resulting shared experience of unity and
collective identity may feel
transcendental, but the mechanisms are
as real and explicable as those governing
individual behaviors and experiences.

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031389.txt,"The reassignment means that the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, Byung J. “BJay” Pak, will
oversee the case for the government. Pak, a former Georgia lawmaker, was appointed Atlanta’s chief federal

prosecutor by President Trump in October 2017.

The Justice Department is still under a Friday deadline for prosecutors to confer with the victims’ attorneys in
an effort to settle the case. On Feb. 22, U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra in Palm Beach ruled that federal
prosecutors, under former Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta, broke the law when they concealed a plea
agreement from more than 30 underage girls in Palm Beach who had been sexually abused by Epstein, a

multimillionaire New York hedge fund manager.

Marra stopped short of voiding the agreement, which granted Epstein and an untold number of accomplices
immunity from federal prosecution for sex trafficking crimes, provided Epstein plead guilty to minor charges in
state court. At the time of the plea deal, federal prosecutors had gathered enough evidence against Epstein to

write a 53-page federal indictment, court records show.

The story behind a Palm Beach sex offender’s remarkable deal

The story behind a Palm Beach sex offender’s remarkable deal

Emily Michot

An investigation by the Miami Herald, “Perversion of Justice,’’ found that after Acosta met privately with one
of Epstein’s lawyers, the government agreed to seal the plea agreement so that no one — not the victims, not
even the state court judge who sentenced Epstein — would know the full extent of his crimes. Epstein, now 66,
was allowed to plead guilty to prostitution charges and served 13 months in the Palm Beach County jail, where
he was given liberal work release, and allowed to travel to New York and his private island in the Caribbean
during his subsequent house arrest. He was released in 2009, and now divides his time between New York,
Palm Beach and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The Herald interviewed four of Epstein’s victims, who were as young as 13 at the time they were abused by
Epstein. They said they felt betrayed by state and federal prosecutors, who treated them like prostitutes instead
of victims. Two of them sued the federal government in 2008 under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, which

grants crime victims the right to be informed about plea deals and to confer with prosecutors.

Marra, in a 33-page opinion, said prosecutors not only intentionally violated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, but
they misled the girls into believing that the FBI’s sex trafficking case against Epstein was ongoing — when, in

fact, prosecutors had secretly closed it after sealing the plea bargain from the public record.

Marra, noting that he reviewed affidavits, depositions and interrogatories, said “Epstein worked in concert with

others to obtain minors not only for his own sexual gratification, but also for the sexual gratification of others.’

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031362.txt,"Basic Policy Plan of Hosting the Convention

NOBEL CHARITABLE TRUST

Points to Keep In Mind in Hosting the Convention ( Direction of Hosting the Convention)

1 .Host Country

#ln the future we will construct a framework where different countries will
rotate to host and support the Convention.

=To establish an implementation model as well as build recognition and
success, the first 3 to 4 Conventions will be held in Japan.

#One of the most well-known environmental instrument is the Kyoto
Protocol adopted in Japan. Despite the many environmental conferences
taking place around the world, no event has ever included an exhibition
of environmental technologies. Therefore, it is a natural course of
events, that this Convention should begin in Japan, which would carry a
significant message . Global consensus on this matter should be easy
to attain.

™Venue candidates include Kyoto from the Kyoto Protocol, and
Okinawa and Hokkaido from the past G8 summits but considering
factors such as transportation, operation and promotion, we would
like to recommend the Tokyo Big Sight (Tokyo International
Exhibition Center.)

3 .Timing of the Conference

#As the formation of NCT and preparations to organize the
support system in Japan will begin in spring 2010, timing of the 1*
Convention will be in the year 2012.

=™Seasonal factors in Japan indicate the best timing for the
conference to be in spring (April-May) or fall (Sept- Oct).

4 .Exhibitors (Corporations)

mWith the cooperation of governments around the world, NCT will
encourage corporations worldwide to participate in the exhibition.

=Participation of Japanese corporations will be managed through the
future energies organization (GSSI Earth Environment Technology
Development Expo Executive Committee)

( Anticipated number of participating corporations: from 500 to 1000 )

5 . Advantages in Participating in the Exhibition

=By participating, corporations will have the opportunity to introduce and promote
their energy efficient products, obtain information on renewable, alternative and
sustainable energy resources, and may obtain rights to or participate in projects.
=By positioning participation itself as a status symbol, higher awareness will be
seen in corporate efforts to engage in environmental friendly endeavors.
=lmproved brand image of participating corporations and an opportunity to
accumulate consumer response data

6 .Operations

#Hosted by: Nobel Charitable Trust

= The GSSI Earth Environment Technology Development Expo
Executive Committee will manage all production and operations of
this convention.

7. \|mplementation Costs

=Funds will be provided by NCT, sponsors, and exhibition fees

will be collected from each participating exhibitor.

virtual agents in preschool-like virtual world environments, as well as commercial humanoid
robot platforms such as the Nao (see Figure 2.1) or Robokind (2.2) in physical preschoollike
robot labs.

Another advantage of focusing on childlike cognition is that child psychologists have created
a variety of instruments for measuring child intelligence. In Chapter 17, we will discuss an
approach to evaluating the general intelligence of human childlike AGI systems via combining
tests typically used to measure the intelligence of young human children, with additional tests
crafted based on cognitive science and the standard preschool curriculum.

To put it differently: While our long-term goal is the creation of genius machines with general
intelligence at the human level and beyond, we believe that every young child has a certain
genius; and by beginning with this childlike genius, we can built a platform capable of developing
into a genius machine with far more dramatic capabilities.

2.4.1 Design for an AGI Preschool

More precisely, we don’t suggest to place a CogPrime system in an environment that is an
exact imitation of a human preschool — this would be inappropriate since current robotic or
virtual bodies are very differently abled than the body of a young human child. But we aim to
place CogPrime in an environment emulating the basic diversity and educational character of
a typical human preschool. We stress this now, at this early point in the book, because we will
use running examples throughout the book drawn from the preschool context.

The key notion in modern preschool design is the “learning center,” an area designed and
outfitted with appropriate materials for teaching a specific skill. Learning centers are designed to
encourage learning by doing, which greatly facilitates learning processes based on reinforcement,
imitation and correction; and also to provide multiple techniques for teaching the same skills,
to accommodate different learning styles and prevent overfitting and overspecialization in the
learning of new skills.

Centers are also designed to cross-develop related skills. A “manipulatives center,” for ex-
ample, provides physical objects such as drawing implements, toys and puzzles, to facilitate
development of motor manipulation, visual discrimination, and (through sequencing and clas-
sification games) basic logical reasoning. A “dramatics center” cross-trains interpersonal and
empathetic skills along with bodily-kinesthetic, linguistic, and musical skills. Other centers,
such as art, reading, writing, science and math centers are also designed to train not just one
area, but to center around a primary intelligence type while also cross-developing related areas.
For specific examples of the learning centers associated with particular contemporary preschools,
see [Nei98]. In many progressive, student-centered preschools, students are left largely to their
own devices to move from one center to another throughout the preschool room. Generally,
each center will be staffed by an instructor at some points in the day but not others, providing
a variety of learning experiences.

To imitate the general character of a human preschool, we will create several centers in our
robot lab. The precise architecture will be adapted via experience but initial centers will likely
be:

e a blocks center: a table with blocks on it
e a language center: a circle of chairs, intended for people to sit around and talk with the
robot

email concluded. “You owe me a large Scotch.”

Mr Staley, who has been heavily criticised for his attempt to unmask a whistleblower,

soon replied to the prankster in effusive terms. Presumably thinking he was talking to his
chairman, who has been dubbed “Mack the Knife” for his habit of ousting chief executives,
Mr Staley said, “You are a unique man, Mr McFarlane”.

“You came to my defense today with a courage not seen in many people. How do I thank
you?” Mr Staley wrote. The 60-year-old Barclays boss continued in the same style: “You
have a sense of what is right, and you have a sense of theatre. You mix humor with grit.
Thank you John. Never underestimate my recognition of your support. And my respect
for your guile.”

He had time for yet more praise before he signed off. “And some day I want to see an ad lib
guitar run. You have all the fearlessness of Clapton,” said Mr Staley, referencing the
legendary guitarist Eric Clapton and his chairman’s fondness for playing his guitar in
public meetings.

The brief conversation ended with a final email around 11pm. The imposter sent a poem,
which began “Worry not of tomorrow’s end” and ended “Revel in their bloodied eyes”. The
first letter of each line spelled out the word ‘Whistleblower’.

“Thanks for sharing the foxhole,” Mr Staley replied.

The prankster, who contacted the Financial Times via Twitter, told us the email was part
of his “battle with Barclays” over a customer issue. “I thought I’d see how Jes was relaxing
after his AGM,” he said.

Barclays declined to comment.
The emails, which the FT has verified are genuine, are reproduced below.

Nutraceuticals

Given robust consumer interest in CBD products, we estimate that over the next two
years, the nutraceuticals category (which includes tinctures, capsules, gummy vitamins,
etc.) can generate revenues of $2.4 bn. Uncertainty around the timing of this revenue
ramp reflects a lack of clarity on how quickly retailers, in particular mass market
retailers, will begin to stock the products following the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill.

Our $2.4 bn estimate is benchmarked against the herbal supplement market in the U.S.
According to the American Botanical Council, herbal supplement retail sales were $6.4
bn in 2014, posting the 11 year of consecutive growth. Between 2004-2014, the
herbal supplement category grew its revenues at a ~4.2% CAGR. Extrapolating that
growth out to 2019 would imply a total herbal supplement market of ~$8 bn over the
next two years. Our $2.4 bn estimate for the CBD market would imply almost a 30%
share of this market by 2020. The importance of retail adoption is reflected in the
category makeup of the herbal supplement market, where we can see that over 17% of
sales come from mass market retailers.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027904.txt,"The day before the end of basic training, I was told to return to Maka Esser.
A Jeep was waiting. A soldier was at the wheel. He mumbled hello and drove
me to a sprawling military base about 15 minutes away, not too far from the
international airport in Lod. It was built by the British in the Second World War
for the RAF. After 1948, the main part had been converted into Israel’s officer-
training school. But at the far end, set back from a criss-cross of runways, was a
pair of domed concrete shelters which had been used by the British for
munitions storage. Five tents. Two field toilets. And a single-story brick
structure with a tin roof. It contained offices for Avraham Arnan, a couple of
other officers and a secretary, a kitchenette and a room for storing weapons.
This was the home of Sayeret Matkal, although the first thing I was told was
that no one, outside a handful of senior officers in military headquarters, knew
we existed.

The heart and soul of Sayeret Matkal was Avraham Arnan. Even from my
brief first encounter with him in his living room in Tzahala, I was struck by his
physical presence, with almost movie-star looks and a face made even more
intriguing by the fact he had different-colored eyes, one brown and one a
piercing green. But what really set him apart, as I got to know him and come
under his spell in the sayeret, was his playful, almost bohemian disregard for the
normal strictures and structures, rules and regulations, of the armed forces.
What mattered to him was what actually needed to get done, and how best to
accomplish it despite all the bureaucratic obstacles, and he made me and his
other teenage recruits feel we were equal partners with him in getting there.

Years later, he confided that if his life had not led him into the military, he
would have probably chosen something in the arts or culture, maybe directing
films. But he had volunteered for the Haganah at age 17, a year before the 1948
war. As the losses mounted in Jerusalem, he found himself in the Palmach’s
crack Harel Brigade, under the command of a future Israeli chief-of-staff, Dado
Elazar.

His vision for Sayeret Matkal became Israel’s answer to the dangers
identified by Rotem. But it had its origins in his experiences in the years after
1948, when he joined a military intelligence group running a loose network of
Arab agents across Israel’s northern border. They provided occasional bits of

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031404.txt,"The reassignment means that the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, Byung J. “BJay” Pak, will
oversee the case for the government. Pak, a former Georgia lawmaker, was appointed Atlanta’s chief federal

prosecutor by President Trump in October 2017.

The Justice Department is still under a Friday deadline for prosecutors to confer with the victims’ attorneys in
an effort to settle the case. On Feb. 22, U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra in Palm Beach ruled that federal
prosecutors, under former Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta, broke the law when they concealed a plea
agreement from more than 30 underage girls in Palm Beach who had been sexually abused by Epstein, a

multimillionaire New York hedge fund manager.

Marra stopped short of voiding the agreement, which granted Epstein and an untold number of accomplices
immunity from federal prosecution for sex trafficking crimes, provided Epstein plead guilty to minor charges
in state court. At the time of the plea deal, federal prosecutors had gathered enough evidence against Epstein to

write a 53-page federal indictment, court records show.

The story behind a Palm Beach sex offender’s remarkable deal

The story behind a Palm Beach sex offender’s remarkable deal

Emily Michot

An investigation by the Miami Herald, “Perversion of Justice,’’ found that after Acosta met privately with one
of Epstein’s lawyers, the government agreed to seal the plea agreement so that no one — not the victims, not
even the state court judge who sentenced Epstein — would know the full extent of his crimes. Epstein, now 66,
was allowed to plead guilty to prostitution charges and served 13 months in the Palm Beach County jail, where
he was given liberal work release, and allowed to travel to New York and his private island in the Caribbean
during his subsequent house arrest. He was released in 2009, and now divides his time between New York,
Palm Beach and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The Herald interviewed four of Epstein’s victims, who were as young as 13 at the time they were abused by
Epstein. They said they felt betrayed by state and federal prosecutors, who treated them like prostitutes instead
of victims. Two of them sued the federal government in 2008 under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, which

grants crime victims the right to be informed about plea deals and to confer with prosecutors.

Marra, in a 33-page opinion, said prosecutors not only intentionally violated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act,
but they misled the girls into believing that the FBI’s sex trafficking case against Epstein was ongoing —

when, in fact, prosecutors had secretly closed it after sealing the plea bargain from the public record.

10 A.L.R. Fed. 2d 789

455, 463; see also Federal RICO Statement Applicable to
Saudi Princes at Ex. A.) The Federal Plaintiffs claim
Prince Salman “fully intended [SHC] would serve as a
vehicle for funding and supporting Islamic militants in
Bosnia, including elements of the al Qaida movement.”
(Federal Compl. J 456.) “Prince Salman knowingly failed
to take appropriate actions regarding the management and
use of funds of the SHC in Bosnia.” (Ashton Compl. J
457; Burnett Compl. § 406.) On December 30, 2000, the
Embassy of the State of Palestine in Riyadh sent Prince
Salman a letter expressing Yasser Arafat’s concern
regarding the funding of radical organizations in
Palestine. (Ashton Compl. | 291; Burnett Compl. § 402.)
Further, Plaintiffs claim Prince Salman “has a history of
funding Islamic extremism,” because he was named the
Chairman of the General Donation Committee for
Afghanistan in 1980, which gave $39 million to aid the
Afghan mujahideen. (Ashton Compl. § 289; Burnett
Compl. § 400.)

In 1994, Prince Salman allegedly stated that he had
personally raised more than six million Saudi Riyals for
Defendant ITRO and Sanabel al-Kheer. (Federal Compl. J
462.) And in 1998, he allegedly donated one million
Saudi Riyals during a fundraising drive by IIRO and
Sanabel al-Kheer. (Federal Compl. § 461.) In 1999,
Prince Salman donated $400,000 during a fundraising
event organized by charity Defendants TTRO, World
Assembly of Muslim Youth (“WAMY”), and
Al-Haramain Foundation for the benefit of Bosnia
Herzegovina and Chechnya. (Ashton Compl. § 290;
Burnett Compl. § 401; Federal Compl. § 461.) Finally,
Plaintiffs claim that members of the Saudi royal family
have assets and do business in the United States. (Ashton
Compl. § 296.)

3. Prince Naif®
Prince Naif has been the Minister of Interior of the
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia since 1975. (Ashton Compl. J
286; Federal Compl. § 433; Prince Naif Mem. in Supp.
Mot. to Dismiss at 1, 5.) According to Plaintiffs, the
Minister of Interior “controls the activities of Islamic
Charities and is empowered to verify their legality and
conduct.” (Ashton Compl. J 286; Burnett Compl. ¥ 382;
see also Federal Compl. § 435 (alleging that as Minister
of Interior Prince Naif is “responsible for the oversight of
charities based within Saudi Arabia, including the
operations of the Saudi Joint Relief Committee [ (“SJTRC’)
], Muslim World League [ (MWL’) ], IIRO, Saudi Red
Crescent, WAMY, and al Haramain Foundation’).) He is
also a member of the Council of Ministers and serves on
the Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs. (Plaintiff's

Mem. in Opp’n to Prince Naif’s Mot. at 2-3, 5.)

Plaintiffs claim that “Prince Naif has engaged in a pattern
of conduct that aids, abets, and materially sponsors
international terrorism and Al Qaeda.” (Ashton Compl. Jf
288, 255; Burnett Compl. JJ 342, 381; Federal Compl. J
434; see also Federal RICO Statement Applicable to
Saudi Princes at Ex. A.) They claim that along with other
Saudi princes, Prince *550 Naif made “monetary payoffs
to Osama bin Laden’s al Qaeda.” (Ashton Compl. § 288;
Burnett Compl. § 381.) “In 1996, according to various
intelligence sources, a group of Saudi princes ... met in
Paris and agreed to continue contributing, sponsoring,
aiding and abetting Osama bin Laden’s terrorist network.”
(Burnett Compl. | 347.) Plaintiffs claim that Prince Naif
and the Saudi government received warnings from the
United States and France that charitable donations to
Islamic charities were being used to fund terrorism. (See
Plaintiffs’ Mem. in Opp’n to Naif’s Mot. to Dismiss at 5.)
Prince Naif was present for one such meeting in 1994
with French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua. (Id.) The
Federal Plaintiffs allege that Prince Naif has used his
position as the Minister of Interior to “protect al Qaida’s
support infrastructure.” (Federal Compl. J 438.)

The Federal complaint further alleges that “[b]etween
1998 and 2000, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, through
SJRC, diverted more than $74 million to al Qaida
members and loyalists affiliated with SJRC bureaus.
Throughout this time, [SJRC] was under the supervision
and control of ... Prince Naif.” (Federal Compl. JJ 126,
436.) “Prince Naif also heads the Saudi Committee for
Relief to Afghans, ... [1]n this position, Prince Naif has
channeled substantial financial and logistical support to
sustain al Qaida’s presence and operations in
Afghanistan.” (Ud. 9 437.) Plaintiffs allege that Prince
Naif is the “Chairman of the Saudi Arabian Committee
for Support of the Intifada al Quds, [which] knowingly
transferred large sums of money to the families of Hamas
terrorists who had executed murderous attacks against
Israelis.” (Ashton Compl. § 287; Burnett Compl. J 379;
Federal Compl. § 439; see also Burnett Compl. J 380
(citing letter written on behalf of Yasser Arafat and
claiming this committee funds radical groups).) As a
result, Plaintiffs assert that “Prince Naif .... supports
suicide martyrs.” (Ashton Compl. § 287; Burnett Compl. J
379.) The Federal Plaintiffs also allege that in 2003, U.S.
Senator Charles Schumer asked that Prince Naif be
replaced as Interior Minister because of his
“well-documented history of supporting — terrorist
financing and ignoring the evidence when it comes to
investigating terrorist attacks on Americans.” (Federal
Compl. | 441.) Finally, the Federal Plaintiffs claim
Prince Naif made significant personal contributions to

pharmaceutical company engaged in a hostile takeover of a smaller,
but highly successful, competitor. Students experience the tough ne-
gotiations, the elimination of dedicated and talented individuals, and
the painful shuffling of roles and responsibilities that accompany ma-
jor change in a modern corporation. Students also confront the com-
plicated (and sometimes conflicting) relationship between social re-
sponsibility, legal responsibility, and profit motive, as they witness the
company’s attempt to establish a new research facility in a blighted
town as a consequence of the merger. As students consider each epi-
sode, they critique the actions and reactions of the central characters,
advise them on next steps, and glean lessons related to negotiation,
change management, legal and ethical issues in corporate governance,
and working with other cultures,

STORY 7: SELLING AND IMPLEMENTING SOLUTIONS

Students begin their work as new project managers at a premier event-
planning company, World Class Events. They begin by qualifying
and prioritizing opportunities to propose work to prospective clients,
pitching to senior management which of the proposals should receive
the greatest budget, based on potential profitability, likelihood of win-
ning, and other relevant considerations. They create a project scope
document for the sales effort, first planning and attending a simulated
meeting with event-planning experts to determine a vision for the
event, including risks and open questions for the client. They then en-
gage in a role-play call with the client, introducing World Class Events
and clarifying the project vision.

Of course, the intent of this curriculum is to prepare students to go
out into the business world. So, there is a natural subject orientation.
The subject is business. But after we acknowledge that, everything else
is different. The curriculum was designed with the 12 cognitive pro-
cesses in mind. Let’s see how that was accomplished.

The real issue in learning in any arena of knowledge is getting
better at the cognitive processes that underlie that knowledge. The
processes involved in learning have been with us as long as there have
been humans. School, and subject-based education, is a more recent
invention. To understand how human learning works, we need to
think more deeply about how we can teach these processes.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027910.txt,"Challenging though our training was, I found every bit of it enthralling and,
with each new test passed, somehow empowering and exhilirating. This was all
the more remarkable because we had still yet to carry out a single operation. If
anyone other than Avraham had been in charge, I think the unit might have
unraveled. The fact that it didn’t was mostly due to of the ethos he created, the
feeling that we were a special breed with a critically important common
purpose, and that sooner or later we would be called on to do special things.
When we were in uniform, it was camouflage dress. When we were on the base,
we mostly wore sandals and shorts. We called each other by our first names,
even the officers.

In its first few years, the sayeret sometimes felt less like an army unit than a
college fraternity. Every spring, we organized a feast in a cavernous hangar on
the edge of our compound. It was called Chag ha Pri, the Feast of the Fruit. For
days ahead of the event, we would mount night raids on kibbutzim, “liberating”
crates of every kind of fruit imaginable, and chicken and lamb if we got lucky.
The only rule was that none of us would steal from our own kibbutzim. Among
the guests at the Feast of the Fruit was an unsuspecting selection of senior
officers whom Avraham knew. A few of them got into the spirit, like Dado
Elazar, his Palmach commander from 1948. The Palmach had held similar
foodfests, with delicacies grabbed from nearby kibbutzim. Dado was by this
time commander of Israel’s armored corps. Since our sayeret was always short
of gasoline for our exercises, he would divert surplus supplies to us. But other
guests were less impressed with the pyramids of oranges and avocados and
mangoes and watermelons. I could almost hear a voice screaming inside them:
these are Israeli soldiers. They’re stealing this stuff.

It was not until the autumn of 1961, nearly eighteen months after I arrived,
that it seemed we might actually be given a real mission. This was largely due
to a change at the top of the military. For much of the 1950s, when Dayan was
chief-of-staff, his right-hand-man was a Haganah veteran named Meir Amit. In
1961, the term of Dayan’s successor as chief of staff, Haim Laskov, was coming
to an end and Amit was in the mix to get the top job. He was already Head of
Operations. In practical terms, that made him the number-two man in the armed
forces. But the job went to Tzvi Tzur, Laskov’s deputy. Amit decided to accept

Cannabis Investment Report | December 2017

Vaporizers and Accessories

Smoking or vaporizing cannabis flower or concentrates is the most popular method of cannabis con-
sumption, in part because the effects of inhaled cannabis smoke or vapor begin almost immediately.
Accessories used to smoke cannabis include glass, wood or metal pipes; glass or plastic water pipes
known as “bongs”; and cigarette papers used to roll “joints.” A vaporizer is a device that heats cannabis
flower or concentrate to a temperature at which its active compounds boil and can be inhaled as vapor.
Vaporizers are increasing in popularity faster than any other cannabis-consumption device, in some
measure because vaporizing is perceived by many as a healthier method of cannabis consumption than
smoking. Distinguishing features of a vaporizer include whether it vaporizes flower or concentrate, the
form of the heating mechanism, or “atomizer,” power output, battery efficiency, durability, reusability
(there are both refillable and disposable vaporizers) and design aesthetics. Hundreds of vaporizers are
marketed, ranging from simple to complex, including handheld vaporizers that retail for $10 to $500
and. tabletop vaporizers that retail for $100 to more than $1,000.

Complaint 147. It also has banks in Chi-
cago, Illinois and Houston, Texas. Bur-
nett Complaint 147. Al Baraka allegedly
provided financial infrastructures in Sudan
to Osama bin Laden through Defendant
charity Al Haramain. Ashton Complaint
119 584, 585, 598; Burnett Complaint 11 48,
49, 62,

Plaintiffs do not offer any factual allega-
tions against Al Baraka or Mr. Kamel to
withstand their motions to dismiss. The
majority of the complaints’ allegations re-
garding Al Baraka actually concern Dallah
Albaraka. The specific allegations against
Al Baraka are that through Al Haramain it
provided financial infrastructures in Su-
dan, it provided support to Al Haramain,
and it is present in the Sudan banking
business through banks it holds. The
complaints do not allege that Al Baraka
knew or had any reason to know that Al
Haramain was supporting terrorism, nor
do they allege facts from which such an
inference could be drawn.

The allegation that an employee of a
Dallah Albaraka subsidiary financially sup-
ported two of the hijackers in San Diego
does not translate into an allegation that
Mr. Kamel provided material support to
terrorism or aided and abetted those that
provided material support. An employee’s
actions cannot be a basis for employer
liability unless the employee was acting in
furtherance of the employer’s business.
Tasso, 1997 WL 16066, at *6. There is no
allegation that Mr. Kamel knew Mr. al
Bayoumi or directed anyone at the Della
Albaraka subsidiary to support al Qaeda or
the hijackers. Similarly, the allegation
that Mr. Kamel was one of three founders
of Al Shamal Islamic Bank in 1983, without
additional allegations, does not state a
claim for relief. Thus, the Ashton and

349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES

Burnett claims against Al Baraka and Mr.
Kamel are dismissed in their entirety.

5. NCB

[99] The Ashton and Burnett Plain-
tiffs’ allegations against NCB are outlined
in Part I.B.4. The Court finds it would be
premature to analyze Plaintiffs’ largely
conclusory claims against NCB under Rule
12(6)(6) at this time. NCB may be im-
mune from suit and further discovery if it
is found to be an instrumentality of the
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its actions
do not fit within the FSIA’s exceptions to
immunity. Additionally, the Court is not
yet convinced that it would be proper to
exercise personal jurisdiction over NCB.
Accordingly, NCB’s motion to dismiss for
failure to state a claim is denied without
prejudice. NCB may renew its motion
upon completion of the limited jurisdiction-
al discovery—tirst with respect to its in-
strumentality status—outlined by the
Court above.

6. Saudi Binladin Group

[100] The Ashton and Burnett allega-
tions against the SBG are outlined in Part
II.C.8. The same allegations that warrant
limited jurisdictional discovery to investi-
gate whether SBG purposefully directed
its activities at the United States and its
contacts with the United States preclude
dismissal under 12(b)(6) at this time. SBG
provided construction support to Osama
bin Laden. Ashton Complaint 11550,
552-53; Burnett Complaint 11319-22. A
branch of SBG purportedly provided shel-
ter to an al Qaeda operative. Ashton
Complaint 1555; Burnett Complaint 1 324.
SBG has, at some point, had a close rela-
tionship with Osama bin Laden, but the
complaints do not specify when or whether
the relationship continues. While these
allegations are certainly not sufficient to
reach a jury, if Plaintiffs demonstrate that

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012788.txt,"of mathematical expression. There are also thousands of ways of being violent, and equally, ways of
counteracting such violence. But none of this takes away from the importance of biology, especially its
role in constraining the form that these expressions take in different environmental settings. To think
otherwise is just wrong.

The debate about version 1.5 of lethal aggression gains interest if we restrict the conversation to
the similarities and differences between chimpanzee and human killing. Similarities speak to our shared
evolutionary history, including the mechanisms we inherited and the pressures that favored this form of
violence. Differences speak to both changes in our biology and the environments we confronted and
created.

Those who argue that the comparison between human and chimpanzee killing lacks any
analytical value come from two different camps. On the one hand are anthropologists such as Robert
Sussman and Brian Ferguson who suggest that chimpanzee killing is infrequent, has little benefit in terms
of resources or competition, and is restricted to populations that are either artificially provisioned by
humans or crowded in by us. They also suggest that the archaeological evidence for human warfare
doesn’t really begin until about 12,000 years ago. As Ferguson notes “To argue that war is a result of
some sort of innate predisposition to wage it requires that war be practiced throughout our prehistoric
past.” This date, so Ferguson continues, is too recent to invoke natural selection as a cause, and leaves
unexplained why there is no earlier evidence of massive killing if our last common ancestors had this
capacity.

These criticisms either fly in the face of contradictory evidence or have little to do with the
original ideas. Concerning chimpanzee killing, the evidence comes from multiple sites in East and West
Africa, including sites with no provisioning and no crowding from humans. Further, analyses by
Wrangham and his colleagues show that humans living as hunter-gatherers or subsistence farmers on the
continents of Africa and South America, engage in coalitionary killing, using stealthy raids and
imbalances of power to minimize the costs and maximize the benefits. Looking at 32 different small
scale societies, calculations of the median death rate were between 164-595 per 100,000 per year.
Looking at 9 chimpanzee communities spanning 5 populations in Tanzania, Uganda, and Ivory Coast, the
rate was 69-287 per 100,000 per year. Chimpanzees fall well within the range of human hunter-gatherers
and subsistence farmers. This evidence not only shows parallels between chimpanzees and human
societies living under conditions most like our ancestors, but also provides a resounding rejection of the
view that chimpanzee killing is infrequent and of trivial importance. If the rates of killing are comparable,
then either they are trivial for both species or trivial for neither. Given that both chimpanzees and human
hunter-gatherers live in small groups, killing even a few individuals can have a dramatic effect on their

capacity to defend resources.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011039.txt,"Negative cash flow, or transfer in, always means new investment added from
outside. Plowback from revenue is excluded, as it is already recognized as a
deduction from positive cash flow. For the firm, the only source of positive cash flow

is proceeds from new shares issued. With this understood,

cash flow = gross cash flow - plowback - transfer in
= earned revenue - plowback - transfer in
= positive cash flow - negative cash flow, (6.6)

where

positive cash flow = earned revenue - plowback, and
negative cash flow = transfer in. (6.7)

Firms use the term gross realized output to mean the same thing as what I call gross

cash flow. A common definition is

gross realized output = realized output + depreciation.

Now we come to the subtle point allowing for deadweight loss. The total return
truism shows that output equals value growth plus cash flow. Then output is
negative wherever the sum of growth and cash flow is less than zero. Natural
disasters and bad investments can make them so. Those unexpected setbacks are
examples of deadweight loss. It amounts to unrecovered depreciation, meaning
depreciation not recovered (realized) in positive cash flow. I'll get back to that soon.

The point at present is that the equation above really means

gross realized output = realized output + recovered depreciation.

Here too | prefer the generality of “decapitalization” over “depreciation”, and define

gross realized output = gross cash flow
= realized output + recovered decapitalization
= earned revenue + recovered decapitalizaton. (6.8)

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030421.txt,"Bizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to know Jeffrey and Ghislaine far better after my piece than before it. I kept running into both of
them, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of young women with him who stand two feet
behind him, as if serving a monarch. “Do they speak?” I remember asking him once, nodding at his lookalike blondes. He
laughed. “Not like vou, Vicky,” was his riposte.

Iremembered that when we’d once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I hadn’t studied math
since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a package at home via messenger. It was a
book: “Math for idiots.”

So he is not without humor, even though he doesn’t drink or smoke, and hates restaurants.

“Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects,” newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He was certainly
preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few moments in his company and
you know this to be true.

When I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that “Andy”—as Jeffrey
calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his strange title is. Because if one thing’s
for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what he’s talking about far more than “Andy” does. Which is
why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other financiers hang out with him.

And Ghislaine?
Full disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It’s almost impossible not to.

She is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I’ve spent hours talking to her about
the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is curious. She has spent weeks at the bottom
of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent me a DVD of the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away
almost anyone else’s I can think of—probably even Rupert Murdochs’. She is very well-read and can talk about most things for
hours. She is passionate about Bill Clinton with whom she is close friends.

Yet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party ofher best friend, Ariadne Calvo-Platero, (known
fondly to her close friends as “the Tennis Goddess’’) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When it comes down to things she
really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her vulnerability.

And that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey.

“He saved her,” Iremember a close friend of mine telling me. “When her father died, she was a wreck; inconsolable. And then
Jeffrey took her in. She’s never forgotten that—and never will.”

In many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect replacement for her
father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his sexual pecadillos, but then Ghislaine’s
father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving a massive “black hole” he’d fraudulently created. To
Ghislaine, Jeffrey’s habits may not have seemed that strange.

In fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful people in the end
either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl issues, and moved countries to avoid
paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You don’t tend to get to the top by being the world’s most
balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett didn’t quite manage a normal life—whatever that is. He had a second
“wife” for many years whose existence he has been open about.

So what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven’t spoken to her orto Jeffrey, but I suspect that her loyalty to friends

like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she’|l be out and about as always. Look at Waksal and Stewart. No one
sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up for all sorts of blemishes.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029170.txt,"dismisses the argument made most aggressively by Harvard law
professor Alan Dershowitz—who offers frequent legal advice to the
President both in person and via television—and repeated recently by
the President, and in the recently revealed letter sent by his lawyers to
the Special Counsel in January, that a president cannot be prosecuted
for exercising his constitutional prerogatives, even if they foster crimes.
Again, the team argues that there is no statute or constitutional
authority that puts the President above the law or that allows him to
contribute to breaking the law.

Curiously, the tradition breakers in the White House—supported
by a many lawyers, both right and left leaning—now argue that the
President's traditional and constitutionally mandated executive powers
give him wide latitude for how he carries out his duties. I don't think
you are going to find a court who will not see the president's role as
unique, said one White House advisor. The Mueller theories are
wishful thinking.

Such an indictment is described in similar ways by both Mueller
and White House insiders: it puts the President's public behavior on
trial. The nature of that behavior, for the Mueller team, is corrupt; this,
according to the White House, is how voters elected the President to
behave.

The Mueller team may have a high hurdle in convincing
Rosenstein to approve the indictment. Giuliani recently put standing
DOJ policy against the indictment of a president in hyperbolic terms: the
President could kill James Comey if he wanted to without fear of
prosecution. But, according to one former senior DOJ lawyer, Rosenstein
in this circumstance may have the power to override the DOJ guidelines.
The Mueller team appears to believe that Rosenstein's pledge before
congress that, absent malfeasance, he will support the Special Counsel's
independence with regard to the Russian investigation, means he will
let the indictment go forward. In one view—and in the suspicion of
some in the White House—he may have already authorized Mueller to
proceed with the indictment.

The counsel's office does, however, according to the papers I have
reviewed, worry about the possibility that Trump will replace
Rosenstein with someone who will fire Mueller or curtail the
investigation. Indeed, the Mueller investigation seems concerned or
shadowed by daily procedural questions of an existential nature—

Rich, following up on your question from a while back about this topic. Please find a white paper attached. 
Regards, 
Amanda 
The election of Donald Trump as President is expected to lead to significant tax law changes. The tax changes may come 
in two parts: from the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) and its related taxes and from comprehensive tax 
reform. Since Republicans will also have majorities in both the House and Senate, such changes could be undertaken 
without bipartisan support. Although it is not yet known exactly what the changes will be or when they would be 
effective, we are issuing this Tax Alert to inform you of changes that are anticipated, based on proposals made during 
the campaign by both President-elect Trump and the House Republicans. We also discuss how these changes may 
impact your planning, both currently and in the future.

such by bidders for the assets themselves. It is a mistake, | think, to suppose that
shares prices would be less volatile if more descriptive of real value underneath.
The existence of trends suggests the opposite. Trends would be expected from
systematic underreaction to the news, so that reaction catches up later, while
systematic overreaction ought to be followed by adjustment in the opposite
direction. This gradual rather than immediate digestion of the news would tend to
smooth out price response. Trends imply systematic underreaction, not
overreaction. Market evidence shows something near that random walk as a usual
rule, implying neither systematic overreaction nor systematic underreaction, but
with some episodes of the latter. What would the reason be? My first guess would be
something delaying the mechanics of price reaction when news is particularly
surprising. Our sense of where prices should go right now seems not to get them
there until later. Prefect reaction to perfect news ought to mean more price

volatility, not less, from day to day.

Stocks are more volatile then most assets because most are “leveraged.” Firms may
issue bonds, and may borrow shorter-term from banks. Fixed interest on those debt
claims is paid first. Shareholders get the rest of net output, which itself fluctuates
around expected norms and is sometimes negative. If a firm’s net profit (net output)
is one million dollars one year, and one dollar higher the next, net profit will have
varied only one ten thousandth of a percent. But if interest payments take up the
same million dollars per year, every year, profit left for shareholders will have
grown from nothing to one dollar. Its growth rate will have been effectively infinite.
If the firm earns two dollars less the year after, it will have to invade capital to pay
the interest, and owners take a one-dollar loss. Again the difference is trivial
percentage-wise to net profit, but diametric to equity investors. The more fixed debt,
the more surprise and volatility in whatever is left for shareholders. The ratio of
debt to that remainder, called “equity,” is the leverage meant. Stock in this security

sense means the same as shares or equity.

sure, scenario-building differs from that of a conventional forensic investigation aimed at finding
pieces of evidence that can be used to persuade a jury ina courtroom. Unlike a judicial
investigation concerned with guilt and innocence, scenario-building looks building looks to
develop a story that is, concurrently: intrinsically consistent, humanly plausible and symbolically
memorable; and in the process, it also identifies and explores the possible holes in the case. Such
scenarios must aim at constituting a limited set of alternatives that are mutually exclusive The
point is to assure that any alternative that fits the relevant facts, no matter how implausible it
initially may seem to be, is not neglected.

One of the most vexing problems that had to be explained by these scenarios is how Snowden
got the passwords to up to 24 of these vaults. He could not have obtained these passwords
during his previous employment at Dell because Dell technicians did not have access to the Level
3 documents stored in these compartments. Nor, as was discussed earlier, was he given access to
them when he transferred to Booz Allen because he had not completed the requisite training.

Snowden had also, it will be recalled, relinquished his privileges as a system administrator when
he transferred to Booz Allen, so he did not have the privilege to override password protection. In
short, his new position as an infrastructure analyst did not give him the ability to enter
compartments which he had not yet been read into.

There are two possible ways he could have gotten these passwords: Either he had assistance
from a party who had access to them or he found flaws in the NSA’s security procedures that left
the supposedly-closed vaults effectively unlocked.

The Unwitting Accomplice Possibility

As for the first alternative, it is possible whatever assistance that Snowden received was entirely
unwitting. For example, he could have simply asked other analysts at the Center who had been
“read into” compartments for their passwords. But such an approach would be extremely risky for
him. Ifan analyst gave him his password, and it was discovered, that analyst could lose his job.
Moreover, any analyst was supposed to report any request for a password to a security officer.
Nor was Snowden, who had been working at the Threat Operations Center for just a few weeks
as a trainee, well known to other analysts. So asking them to break the rules was fairly risky for
Snowden. “It is inconceivable to me that his co-workers would divulge their passwords to him,”
a former Booz Allen executive, who had also worked at the Defense Intelligence Agency, told
me. “If he was a system administrator he might trick a threat analyst into entering his password
into his computer under the pretext that he needed it to deal with an urgent hardware issue.” But
Snowden was not a system administrator at the Center. Snowden therefore “had no plausible
reason for requesting passwords to compartment he had not been read into,” the former executive
said. I asked him what the chance was of him obtaining some 24 passwords in 5 weeks. “In my
opinion, near zero,” he said. I next asked him whether it was possible that Snowden could have
used a device for intercepting another computer’s electronic signals, called by hackers a “key
logger.” Such a device, which was obtainable over the Internet, could be used to steal passwords
of the analysts who had been “read into” the compartments. My source said that while it was

psychological data. Opinions differ as to whether this sort of modeling is valuable for achieving
AGI goals. CogPrime is not designed to support this kind of modeling, as it intentionally does
many things very differently from humans.

ACT-R in its original form did not say much about perceptual and motor operations, but
recent versions have incorporated EPIC, an independent cognitive architecture focused on mod-
eling these aspects of human behavior.

4.2.3 Cyc and Texai

Our review of cognitive architectures would be incomplete without mentioning Cye [LG90],
one of the best known and best funded AGIL-oriented projects in history. While the main focus
of the Cyc project has been on the hand-coding of large amounts of declarative knowledge,
there is also a cognitive architecture of sorts there. The center of Cyc is an engine for logical
deduction, acting on knowledge represented in predicate logic. A natural language engine has
been associated with the logic engine, which enables one to ask English questions and get
English replies.

Stephen Reed, while an engineer at Cycorp, designed a perceptual-motor front end for Cyc
based on James Albus’ Reference Model Architecture; the ensuing system, called Cognitive-
Cyc, would have been the first full-fledged cognitive architecture based on Cyc, but was not
implemented. Reed left Cycorp and is now building a system called Texai, which has many
similarities to Cyc (and relies upon the OpenCyc knowledge base, a subset of Cyc’s overall
knowledge base), but incorporates a CognitiveCyc style cognitive architecture.

Monday, contending that
teenage girls who have ac

psychopathy is utterly novel to me and most interesting. I had always thought of
dominance hierarchies as being associated with tyranny and despotism—but are
these not often associated with psychopathy?!

“NEAR FIXATION”—SEZ WHO? OH YOU AND YOUR STUDENTS—NOW THAT'S A
SURPRISE.

Consider the “Butcher of Bagdad” Saddam Hussein or the sadistic Basir Assad. The
only thing they didn’t do is specialize in rape, although Saddam’s son Uday did and
we can be sure each had greater than average reproductive success but note how
sensitive each is to degree of relatedness writ large. Saddam was most biased
toward people that came from his place of birth, along the Tigrit River, then people
in the surrounding province and then Sunnis over Shia.

Since he was willing to kill others on a large scale—200,000 Shia slaughtered when
the idiotic first Bush allowed Saddam to retain his Airforce after we had marched to
Bagdad after flinging Saddam’s troops out of Kuwait. Or for that matter, Saddam’s
attack on Shia Iran which claimed more than a million lives on both sides.

seek common ground with their children, while other people remain true to their earlier world
views. It depends on the life one has lived.

I have been fortunate to live an ever changing life, both personally and professionally, and
although my views on particular issues have been modified over time, my basic commitment to
liberal values has remained relatively constant, in part because of my strong upbringing and in part
because my career has been based on advocating these values.

An ancient Chinese curse goes this way: “May you live in interesting times.” One of the worst
things a doctor can say after examining you is: “Hmm... that’s interesting.” I have been blessed
with living an interesting, if often controversial, life.

As an adolescent, I was involved in causes such as justice for the Rosenbergs, abolition of the
death penalty, and the end of McCarthyism.

As a law clerk, during one of the most dramatic periods of our judicial history, I worked on
important civil rights and liberties cases, heard the “I have a dream” speech of Martin Luther
King, was close to the Cuban Missile Crisis, and partook of events following the assassination of
John F. Kennedy.

As a young lawyer, I played a role in the Pentagon Papers case, the forced resignation of Richard
Nixon, and the anti-war prosecutions of Dr. Spock, the Chicago Seven, the Weather
Underground and Patricia Hearst. I consulted on the Chappaquiddick investigation of Ted
Kennedy, on the attempted deportation of John Lennon and the draft case against Mohammad
Ali. I was an observer at the trial of accused Nazi war criminal John Demjanjuk and subsequently
consulted with the Israeli government about that case.

Later in my career, I was a lawyer in the Bill Clinton impeachment, the Bush v. Gore election
case, the efforts to free Nelson Mandela, Natan Sharansky and other political prisoners. I
participated in the Senate censure of California Senator Alan Cranston, the Frank Snepp CIA
censorship case, prosecutions involving the former Yugoslavia in the Hague, the defense of Israel
against international war crime prosecution, and the investigation of Wiki-Leaks and Julian
Assange. I worked on the appeals of the Jewish Defense League murder case and the Jonathan
Pollard spy prosecution. I consulted on the defense of director John Landis, the OJ Simpson
double murder case and the Bakke “affirmative action” litigation. I challenged the Bruce Franklin
tenure denial at Stanford and appealed the Claus Von Bulow attempted murder conviction, the
Leona Helmsley tax case, the Mike Tyson rape prosecution, the conviction of Conrad Black, the
Tison Brothers murder case, the “I Am Curious Yellow” censorship prosecution, the Deep Throat
case, the nude beach case on Cape Cod and the HAIR censorship case. I participated in the
Woody Allen-Mia Farrow litigation, the Michael Milken case, the litigation against the cigarette
industry and the wrongful death suit on behalf of Steven J. Gould. I have won more than 100
cases and have been called—perhaps also with a bit of hyperbole—“the winningest appellate
criminal defense lawyer in history.” Of the more than three dozen murder and attempted murder
cases in which I have participated, I lost fewer than a handful. None of my capital punishment
clients has been executed.

traction, 4) lower conversion rates on mobile, 5) mobile conversions with 30% fee to
Apple and Google Play marketplaces could negatively impact margins, and 6)
international expansion may not be successful given different demographics.

Upside risks to our PO are 1} lower marketing spend resulting in higher margins and
better leverage in 2016, 2) revenue upside from cross-selling and word of mouth, 3}
increase length of stay for paid subscribers, reducing churn, and 4) traction from new
care offerings, Care at Work, and international expansion.

eBay (EBAY)

Our $38 price objective is based on 17x our 2018E EPS. Our 17x P/E multiple is slightly
ahead of the retail comp group average of about 16x, reflecting eBay's potential for a
Marketplace growth acceleration in 2017.

Risks to our price objective are: 1) competition from Amazon and other new
Marketplaces in the U.S., competition from Amazon, Alibaba and local incumbents in
International markets, and competition from multi-channel retailers that are
aggressively investing in the online channel, 2) vulnerability to future Google algorithm
changes, 3) decelerating user growth, resulting in eCommerce market share losses, and
4) currency risk including FX volatility impact on cross border trade. The stock has been
subject to heavy volatility in the past based on GMV growth and market share trends
and this volatility could increase due to economic uncertainty.

Expedia (EXPE)

Our $146 price objective is based on our sum of the parts (SOP) that assumes 9x 2018E
EBITDA for the core OTA business (a discount to Priceline at approx. 15x due to slower
organic growth and higher taxes on earnings), 8x 2018E EBITDA for Egencia (we expect
single digit growth), 60% ownership of Trivago (using our PO), and HomeAway at 15x
2018 EV/EBITDA.

Downside risks to our PO are: 1) economic downturn leading to fewer travel bookings, 2)
competition for European traffic lowering the company's growth or margin opportunity,
3) hotels favoring lower-cost alternative distribution channels and limiting Expedia's
access to inventory, 4) Google and/or TripAdvisor disintermediation, and 5) the negative
impact of terrorism and disease on global travel trends.

Facebook (FB)

Our $165 price objective is based on 24x our non-GAAP 2018E EPS and 27x GAAP EPS,
multiples equal to about 1x 2018E revenue growth, mostly in-line with its social and
online media peers.

Risks are: 1) high valuation that discounts strong growth, 2) changes in user
engagement impacts optimism on revenue opportunities and compresses the stock
multiple, 3) privacy issues or pushback on Facebook's policy changes impact revenue
generation, 4) risks to executing Messenger & WhatsApp monetization, 5) potential for
higher investment to negatively impact margins, and 6) a macroeconomic impact on
advertising pricing.

Fitbit (FIT)

Our $6.50 price objective is based on 0.5x EV/S multiple which is below the device
manufacturer peer group at 1.8x, but justified in our view given declining revenue and
profitability, FCF burn, market saturation, and limited visibility into the next product cycle.

Upside risks are: 1) international product launches and expansion, 2) higher-than-
expected ASPs, 3) new product launches domestically, 4) slower-than-expected OpEx
ramp, 5) software monetization and 6) corporate wellness program growth.

cost as little as $2 per gallon, or about half the price
gas currently goes for at local pumps, to produce at a
full-sized facility, even though such an industrial plant
would require a lot of capital to build.

However, the machine Fang shows me is not run-
ning on the biomass that Fang originally tested: wood
chips, switchgrass, canary grass, miscanthus. Instead,
it churns through natural gas, turning methane into
syngas. Making long hydrocarbons from the single car-
bon in methane molecules is “very easy,” he assures
me. But “natural gas is not true green,” he concedes.
“There is no benefit in [the reduction of] greenhouse
gases. Biomass 1s still true green.”

Natural gas from the fracking boom has revolution-
ized the global energy landscape—particularly in the
United States, the world’s biggest producer of shale
gas. But it is also controversial. Gas burns cleaner, but
it still produces around half the greenhouse emissions
of its dirtier cousins like coal, not including the excess
methane that leaks from fracking sites and the pipe-
lines that transport the gas. Fracked gas can also con-
taminate groundwater supplies. And while in 2012 it
brought America’s carbon footprint down to its low-
est level in 20 years, relying on it in the long-term will
make it hard to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, as
is required to combat climate change.

As the price of natural gas slid in response to the
glut of shale gas, Primus changed gears in mid-2012
to move away from biomass and to focus on making
syngas from natural gas. This is not a new idea: Exx-
onMobil built a plant in New Zealand in 1986 to turn
natural gas into methanol and then gasoline, but aban-
doned its efforts when the price of petroleum dropped
dramatically in the mid 1990s. Now, though, natural
gas 1s cheap and attractive. Boyayian has a map of all
the shale formations in North America tacked to the
wall of his office. “The world is full of shale,” he notes.

An earlier version of Primus’ machine, tuned to pro-
cess biomass, sits swathed in silvery insulating tape
in a locked and darkened lab. “Right now it is aban-
doned,” Fang says. The company insists that the state-
ment doesn’t apply to Primus’s biomass efforts more
generally. “This is the way to get to biofuels,” says Pri-
mus CEO Robert Johnsen, of the gas to gasoline pro-
cess, through a tight smile. “Will we be the ones to get
there? Maybe.”

e  Mary’s Whole Pet. Whole plant CBD remedies for pets, sold in retailers and
online in the U.S. and international markets.

Mary’s is a high-end brand, focused on clean delivery methods through its transdermal
patches, topicals and patented gel pen technologies. In March 2018, Mary’s Nutritionals
was chosen as the preferred CBD vendor partner for all Ritz Carlton, Marriott, JW
Marriott, W, and St. Regis Locations.

Mile High Labs. Based in Colorado, Mile High Labs is the largest extractor of CBD in the
world. The company sources hemp from third party cultivation partners across four
states, which include Colorado, Oregon, New York, and Kentucky. Mile High Labs
extracts exclusively from industrial hemp flower material to create full spectrum
extract, distillate and isolate. Their full spectrum extract contains a full range of CBD
terpenes and over 60% CBD on average, making it useful for low concentration
formulations in holistic and wellness applications, including tinctures and capsules. Mile
High Labs distillate is refined using proprietary molecular distillation technology and
contains ~85% CBD on average, making it ideal for vape pen cartridges, tinctures and
other high potency formulations. The company’s isolate contains ~99% CBD and is used
as a main ingredient in bioceutical and nutritional product applications. Mile High offers
end-to-end certified GMP hemp CBD manufacturing. In October 2018, Mile High Labs
raised $35 mm ina Series A, which according to CEO Jason Roth represented a “record-
breaking investment [which] is a reflection of the growth in demand for quality CBD
products and Mile High Labs’ unique ability to meet that demand.” CFO Jonathan Hilley
also recently noted that he believes “the CBD market is in the early stages of a 20-year
secular growth trend.”

Papa & Barkley. Papa & Barkley is based in California, with a diverse portfolio of
products and lines. The company’s Re/eaf line spans multiple form factors, including
tinctures, capsules, patches, and balms, among others, which are comprised of different
THC:CBD ratios. Papa & Barkley’s Essentials line is specifically focused on CBD, and as it
stands, they offer a tincture in both a 15 ml bottle (450 mg CBD) and 30 ml bottle (900
mg CBD) and will soon be rolling out capsules, as well as an extra strength pain balm.
The company is only in California currently, but is looking at going to market in three
other primary states, as well as three other secondary states.

Recess. Launched in October 2018, Recess is a wellness company currently specializing
in beverages which are infused with full spectrum hemp extract. The company has
positioned itself as a modern day lifestyle brand and daytime productivity enhancer that
offers a universal message and idea instead of being anchored specifically to CBD. This
strategy shares similarities with traditional CPG products, such as energy drinks and
soda, which are not marketed for the active ingredient, but instead as the solution.
While the current product portfolio includes sparkling beverages only, Recess plans on
rolling out a plain water, as well as powders, which will cater to on-premise
consumption occasions, such as coffee shops, juice shops and cocktail bars.

Reliva CBD Wellness. Reliva is a CBD-focused company, which form factors include
tincures, shots, sprays, topicals, gummies, and pet care. The company is run by Miguel
Martin, who previously served as the President and GM of Logic Technology
Development, an e-cigarette manufacturer in the U.S. Reliva’s products are focused on
value from an absolute pricing perspective, as nothing sells for over $19.99 at retail. The
company is unique insofar as they do not offer e-commerce, nor do they make and
claims on efficacy or rely on testimonials or influencer marketing, which Martin believes
will create a narrative on responsibility. Reliva focuses on independent c-stores and
grocery channels and is expected to be in ~1,000 stores by the end of March, growing to
4,000-5,000 stores by the end of the summer with the goal of doubling that store count
to ~10,000 locations by year-end.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027938.txt,"This interlude instantly conferred on us the desert equivalent of street cred.
The next morning, Talik agreed we could accompany the Seventh Brigade as it
moved deeper into the Sinai, and peel off when we got closer to Gebel Libni to
complete our “sayeret mission.” Given the early course of the fighting, and our
forces’ rapid advances in the Sinai, I couldn’t help wondering whether there
was any real need to defuse, much less remove, the bugging machinery. But the
very fact that the kirya, in the early hours of the war, had still wanted us to try
was a reflection of the deep sense of apprehension in Israel in the weeks before
the war. Even now, it appeared, there was a concern that the Egyptians might
reclaim the parts of the Sinai which we had captured.

When the armored column got close to Gebel Libni, I pulled our Jeep aside
and headed for the stretch of communications cable where we’d planted the
intercept. For several hours, I tried to accomplish in broad daylight what I’d
failed to do in the desert darkness four months earlier. But it was no use. I
finally told Avraham we’d be better off just blowing it up. I attached an
explosive charge and set a two-minute delay. We watched from a couple of
hundred yards away as the whole assembly disintegrated. Then we rejoined the
Seventh Brigade.

Before sunset on the third day of the war, we reached the Egyptian air base
at Bir Gafgafa in the heart of the Sinai. Even had the war ended then, we would
have been in control of a large chunk of the desert buffer zone which Ben-
Gurion had hoped to retain after the 1956 war. But now, more quickly than even
the most optimistic planners in the kirva could have anticipated, Talik was
poised to move on — toward the Suez Canal, and the main towns and cities of
Egypt. As the Seventh Brigade billeted down in Bir Gafgafa, Talik sent his
reserve brigade westward, in the direction of the canal.

We went with them. The battalion was more mobile than a pure tank force,
but also more vulnerable: lightly armored French AMX-13s and a collection of
the halftracks which I dimly, unfondly, remembered from my fironut. A few of
the AMXs led the way, then a line of halftracks, and more tanks at the rear. I
nosed our Jeep into the middle, behind the battalion commander, a lieutenant-
colonel named Ze’ev Eitan. There were scattered groups of Egyptian soldiers on
either side of us, and they aimed an occasional burst of fire in our direction. But
there seemed little point in shooting back. We didn’t need to fight, and it was
clear that the Egyptians didn’t really want to.

Shortly before dark, Lieutenant-Colonel Eitan brought our column to halt.
The road we were on cut through tall sandunes on either side. We knew there

volunteer for CFI D.C.

° At the event, you asked for her business card. Later, you followed her as she was leaving and asked
her if she was “of age.”

° Later, you emailed her to invite her to dinner.

° You planned to dine with her in the restaurant at the Washington D.C. hotel where you were staying.

° You told her to come up to your room first because you needed to finish some work.

° In your hotel room, you seemed in no rush to leave. You ordered a cheese plate, and later champagne,
despite her suggestion that you go down to dinner.

° You then made a comment about her eye makeup, getting very close to her face.

° You then lifted her by her arms, and pushed her onto the bed beneath you, forcibly kissing her and

trying to pull down the crotch of her tights.
° She struggled to push you off her.
° You said, “When | was in college | could never get a girl that looked like you.”

° When you pulled out a condom, she got out from under you. She said “I have to go,” and rushed out of
the room.

Incident 2:

° In an incident that occurred in fall of 2007 while you were a physics professor at Case Western Reserve
University, a student tried to talk to you about her plans after graduation. You mentioned to her how tough it
must be to have all the other physics majors asking her out on dates.

° In a second incident in December of 2007, while you were still at Case Western, the same student
visited your office to interview you for a student science journal. You closed the door behind her, and ignored
the questions she had prepared. Then you made a casual comment about taking her out for dinner.

° Later, in a regular column for the school paper, she described her experiences with you, without
mentioning you by name. “There was even one particular creep of a professor who once told me he thought
differently of me compared to other students and asked me to dinner: a situation so disturbing that it left me
upset for weeks afterward,” she wrote.

° She was then approached by a dean at the university, who suspected that she was referring to you,
based on a previously reported incident with another student. He encouraged her to make a complaint, and
she did.

° University investigators interviewed both you and the student.

° On September 4, 2008, Susan Nickel-Schindewolf, the university’s associate vice president for student
affairs, wrote to the student, telling her that the investigation was complete. She wrote that you had been told:
“This type of behavior could constitute sexual harassment in violation of the university’s sexual harassment
policy.”

° The letter also stated that you were prohibited from making contact with the student as long as she
remained at Case.

° The letter also stated that you are required to get approval from the dean or the chair of the physics
department before setting foot on the campus again.

° The letter also stated, “Dr. Krauss expressed regret about having a negative impact on you, and also
his willingness to use this complaint as an opportunity to reflect and improve on his future interactions with
students.”

° By then, you had already left Case, taking up your current position at Arizona State University the
month before.

° “The opportunities being offered at ASU are simply too great to turn down at this stage in my career,”
you told Case colleagues, in an email announcing your departure on April 16, 2008.

at that address, or elsewhere.” *570 (Burnett Compl. J
262; Ashton Compl. § 334.) The complaints further allege
that many of the “SAAR Network” organizations’ offices
in Herndon were raided in March 2002 as part of
Operation Greenquest to investigate “potential money
laundering and tax evasion activities and their ties to
terrorist groups such as ... al Qaeda as well as individual
terrorists ... (including) Osama bin Laden.” (Burnett
Compl. J 263; Ashton Compl. § 335.) As noted above,
Plaintiffs claim that the entity Defendants are among
numerous co-conspirators, material sponsors, and/or
aiders and abettors of the SAAR Network. (Burnett
Compl. § 267; Ashton Compl. § 339.) The Plaintiffs also
refer the Court to their allegations regarding charity
sponsors of terror. (See, e.g., Burnett Compl. J¥ 150-53
(alleging, for example, that charity Defendants “are used
as terrorist fronts, to mask money transfers and provide
cover for terrorist operatives”).) Additionally, the Ashton
complaint claims that IIT received its “operating
expenses” from SAAR and “in turn financed two Florida
charitable organizations accused of being cells for Islamic
Jihad in Florida.” Ud. § 579.)

Unlike the SAAR Network entities whose motions to
dismiss the Federal complaint the Court considered in its
previous opinion and order, see Terrorist Attacks I, 349
F.Supp.2d at 822—23, these Defendants do not dispute that
this Court has personal jurisdiction over them. Although
each of these moving Defendants filed a separate motion
to dismiss, their arguments in favor of dismissal are
similar.’ They argue that, even “assum[ing] that plaintiffs
have stated a claim against the ‘SAAR Network,’ ” (see,
e.g., African Muslim Agency’s Mem. in Supp. Mot. to
Dismiss at 3, n.1) the complaints must be dismissed
because they contain only conclusory allegations that they
are “co-conspirator[s], material sponsor[s], and/or aider[s]
and abettor[s] of the SAAR Network.” (Burnett Compl. J
267; Ashton Compl. § 339.) Further, they argue that the
complaints must be dismissed because they do not allege
that they donated any money improperly, or with the
knowledge that it would be given to Osama bin Laden, al
Qaeda, or to any other charity allegedly funneling money
to terrorists.

381 Plaintiffs offer the legal conclusion that the SAAR
Network entities conspired with the SAAR Network.
These Defendants, however, have no notice of the factual
grounds on which Plaintiffs’ claims of conspiracy are
based. See Jackson, 372 F.3d at 1271 (explaining
Swierkiewicz does not permit bare conclusory allegations
without notice of the factual grounds on which they
purport to be based); see also Bodner v. Banque Paribas,
114 F.Supp.2d 117, 125 (E.D.N.Y.2000) (noting the
Second Circuit “has dismissed complaints which plead

WESTLAW

conspiracy in vague or conclusory terms and which do not
allege specific instances of misconduct in furtherance of
the conspiracy”); Ying Jing Gan v. City of New York, 996
F.2d 522, 534 (2d Cir.1993) (explaining that on a Rule
12(b)(6) motion, “legal conclusions, deductions or
opinions couched as factual allegations are not given a
presumption of truthfulness”) (internal quotations
omitted)). The Burnett complaint against African Muslim
Agency, Grove Corporate, Heritage Education Trust,
International Institute of Islamic Thought, Mar—Jac
Investments, Mar—Jac Poultry, Reston Investments, Safa
Trust, *571 and York Foundation is therefore dismissed
without prejudice. For the same reasons, the Ashton
complaint against Mar—Jac Poultry is dismissed without
prejudice.

3°] The Ashfon complaint alleges one action by IIIT in
support of its claims—that it allegedly financed two
charitable organizations in Florida accused of being
Islamic Jihad cells. The complaint does not allege that
INT knew these charities were Islamic Jihad cells or
whether and how these cells participated in or contributed
to al Qaeda’s agenda of terror. See Boim II, 291 F.3d at
1011-12 (making donations to an alleged terrorist group,
without “knowledge of and intent to further payee’s
violent criminal acts,” cannot sustain cause of action).
Accordingly, the Ashton complaint against TIT is
dismissed without prejudice.

41 In support of the claim that Mar—Jac Poultry is a
material sponsor of terrorism, Plaintiffs allege two acts:
first, that it donated money to African Muslim Agency,
which the Plaintiffs clatm was later “laundered,” and
second, that it donated money to unnamed SAAR
Network entities, which was later forwarded to al Qaeda.
(See Federal RICO Statement Applicable to SAAR
Network Entities at 5(f) and Ex. A.) The RICO claim
against Mar—Jac Poultry is dismissed because it is not
alleged that Mar—Jac had any role in directing an
enterprise, see Redtail Leasing, Inc., 1997 WL 603496, at
*5. The Federal complaint does not provide Mar—Jac
Poultry with notice as to how it could be liable for the
terrorist attacks. See Boim IT, 291 F.3d at 1012 (“To hold
the defendants liable for donating money without
knowledge of the donee’s intended criminal use of the
funds would impose strict liability. Nothing in the
language of the statute or its structure or history supports
that formulation.”). Mar—Jac’s motion to dismiss the
Federal complaint is therefore granted.

How can we offer new curricula and new ways of learning if no mat-
ter what we do children must pass algebra tests? Each administration
says over and over again that science is important, but since science
in high school is defined for the most part by boring tests of vocabu-
lary terms and definitions, who would be excited to learn science? If
a really good scientific reasoning curriculum were created, the schools
could not offer it unless it helped kids pass the very same tests that
that curriculum was intended to replace.

We must make radical change. The only way to do that is to stop
focusing on teaching subjects and stop using the fact-based tests are
the natural end result of that focus on subjects.

An education system based on cognitive processes would look
very different indeed.

before me, provoked more left-wing parties like Meretz to suggest that if I really
wanted peace, I’d be ready to give away more, and more quickly.

My position wasn’t helped by the way I had come over in the media during my
first months as Labor leader. A number of newspaper commentators wrote that
while they found talking with me stimulating, I seemed to be operating in a world
of my own, either unable or unwilling to give straight answers and a single, clear
message. They were right about that. If asked a question, especially one which
obviously involved an issus of nuance, my instinct was not to come up with a
sound bite. It was, as best I could, to answer fully and accurately. The difficulties
that could sometime cause hit home in an interview with a leading Israeli journalist
in the spring of 1998. He asked how my life might have turned out if I’d been born
and raised not as a kibbutznik, but a Palestinian. I answered: “At some stage, I
would have entered one of the terror organizations and fought from there, and later
would certainly have tried to influence from within the political system.” I did
hasten to add that I abhorred terrorists, describing their actions as “abominable...
villainous.” But that was lost in the political storm that followed. All I’d done was
answer as honestly I could. What if I had been one of the Palestinian babies in
Wadi Khawaret, but with the same mind and same impulses that had defined my
life as an Israeli? I assumed that instead of becoming an Israeli soldier and
politician, I would have become the closest thing to a Palestinian equivalent. Still,
as even my brother-in-law, Doron Cohen, told me when he phoned a couple of
hours later, it was not the most astute thing to say as a potential candidate for
Prime Minister.

None of this might have mattered if I’d been able to show I was bringing Labor
nearer to defeating Bibi. But the only measure of progress that the media paid
attention to was the opinion polls. Briefly, in late 1977, I did pull ahead, during the
period leading up to Bibi’s agreement to pull out of most of Hebron. But for much
of 1998, I was running behind, and questions about my leadership surfaced
publicly by the summer. The media commentators spoke of the need for a Labor
“liftoff.” Why, after a full year as leader, had I failed to deliver it?

Monday, contending that
teenage girls who have ac

with his fami-

give him massages, Goldberg-

He had no explanation as to
why Epstein would pay girls or
women with no massage train-

said was the case — $200 to
$300 for their visits. “The

Epstein, 53, was indicted
by a county grand jury last

that included sifting through

his home, Palm Beach police
concluded there was enough

The case for naming a U.S. secretary of Culture 
Music critic Mark Swed says it's time we have someone in the Cabinet who can 
speak to our common identity: Arts and the humanities help us figure out who we 
are. 
By Mark Swed, Los Angeles Times Music Critic 
6:00 AM PST, January 19, 2013 
Along with adding the finishing touches to his 
inaugural address on Monday, President Obama has 
plenty on his plate. He is consumed by the 
responsibilities of selecting new Cabinet members and 
preparing strategies to get them confirmed. He already 
had his fair share of critics, and the last thing he needs 
is a music critic telling him how to run the country. 
So I'm sorry to have to be the one to remind you, Mr. 
President, that you've left someone out. Secretary of 
Culture. It's time. 
Despite a troubling international reduction of 
government support for the arts thanks to the world 
economic crises, most countries still manage to 
maintain ministries of culture, and not just seats of 
Western civilization such as France, Italy, Spain, Great Britain and Greece but also in Albania, Brazil, 
Haiti, Ethiopia, Cambodia and about 50 other countries. We, instead, have the National Endowment 
for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.

I'm a great supporter of these institutions, but I'm calling for their removal and the creation of a new 
Cabinet-level agency for culture. The NEA, to which I've been closest in my career, is a wonderful 
organization, doing what it can to support institutions (if no longer individual artists) large and small. 
But it is also a political football and it is always going to be one. 
One of the calls to abolish the NEA, for instance, came from Mitt Romney in last year's campaign, as 
part of his proposal to balance the budget But during the debates Obama failed to note that 
investment in the arts is a more reliable jobs creator than in nearly all industries, nor is it easily 
outsourced. That has been an idee fixe of the Obama-appointed outgoing NEA head, Rocco

Landesman. Even so, Landesman's budget got slashed 13% for fiscal 2012 to an embarrassing $146 
million. 
As arts supporters love to point out, that is less than half of the budget the Pentagon provides for 
military bands alone. In cash-strapped France, on the other hand, Minister of Culture and 
Communication Aurelie Filippetti was enraged when President Francois Hollande cut the 2013 budget 
of her department 4.3% to 7.363 billion euros, which is just under $10 billion. According to 
Landesman, the U.S. remains the weakest funder of arts in the developed world. 
From the start, Obama had seemed a good prospect for becoming an arts president, and four years 
ago, as he was about to assume office, 76,000 people signed a petition, instigated by Quincy Jones, 
begging the new president to create a Cabinet-level cultural ministry patterned after France's. He has 
stepped out to arts events and invited artists from many genres to the White House. But he's kept that 
pretty low profile. The arts can be a lightning rod among populist politicians, and Washington is 
divided enough as it is. Clearly Obama has had other preoccupations than cabinetizing culture. But 
that divisiveness is precisely why we need a Cabinet-level spokesperson for culture. We have come to 
see ourselves as a country of opposites. The allocation of public funds for just about anything is 
viewed as a war between the rich and the poor. We color our states red or blue. Some of us love guns; 
some of us hate them. Go down the line, and there appears to be less and less on which we agree. 
One thing we do have in common is our identity. Wherever we are on whatever spectrum, we see 
ourselves as Americans. It is that culture that makes everything else matter. The arts and the 
humanities help us figure out who we are. 
A Department of Culture, into which the current NEA and NEH might be folded, may not be 
protected from budgetary vulnerability, but it would at least have more prestige and perhaps more 
stability. It would also empower a public spokesperson for culture. 
Maybe even more essential is the influence a secretary of Culture could have in a way-too-wonky 
Washington. I know there aren't regular Cabinet meetings anymore where all the secretaries gather 
around a big table and hash out all the issues of the country. Imagine, though, a perfect White House, 
where Cabinet officials did often collect, and among them sat a political outsider, a generalist who 
could offer rich historical insight from the humanities and visionary thinking from the arts. 
PHOTOS: Arts and culture in pictures by The Times 
Ideally, a secretary of Culture should be a political outsider, able to function as a moral conscience for 
all decision making. He or she would further serve as someone able to ask the hard questions, to see 
the world from possibly unexpected angles and help prompt new solutions to old problems. As artists 
know and politicians refuse to acknowledge, all you have to do to create change is change your mind. 
So whom could we get? Who could speak in such a way that the right and left would listen? Who 
from the arts or the humanities could possibly win the respect of expert wonks? Who could inspire a 
divided nation? 
I've saved my suggestions for last because you're going to think them outlandish. They're not. 
First, I nominate Peter Sellars. Stop laughing How is an L.A.-based theater, opera and festival 
director who sports spiky hair, strings his own beads, buys his clothes at thrift shops and regularly 
http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-secretary-of-culture-notebook-... 3/27/2013 
The case for naming a U.S. secretary of Culture - latimes.com Page 3 of 3 
courts controversy ever going to become a national spokesperson, to say nothing of a Washington 
official? 
Sellars, however, happens to be one of the most persuasive and inspirational public figures we have. 
He exhibits a bottomless empathy and spirituality with broad reach. Yes, some of his productions 
have been left-leaning, but he can, one on one, reach just about everyone. He is politically motivated 
and sophisticated. He thinks profoundly about social issues. 
He also has a way with politicians. A few years ago he was asked to speak at the World Economic 
Forum in Davos, Switzerland, about nuclear proliferation — something he became highly 
knowledgeable about when he and composer John Adams put on Doctor Atomic, an opera about the 
creation of the atomic bomb. Sellars held heads of state in awe. 
My second nomination is Leon Botstein, president of Bard College in New York state. He is one of 
our few remaining public intellectuals and a renaissance man, which means he is a conductor, 
educator and scholar. He too is unusually persuasive when speaking on any number of issues to any 
kind of audience. 
Yes, he's also a liberal, one who as a young man could hold his brilliant own against William F. 
Buckley on Firing Line. But he is just as brilliant an administrator who, in his nearly 40-year tenure 
at Bard, has made the school into one of the most progressive and prominent humanities colleges in 
the country by appealing to donors on all sides of the political spectrum. He's an egghead who goes on 
The Colbert Report. 
Botstein makes things happen, and he makes them happen by persuading people to look beyond their 
preconceptions, to view society in broad and grand terms. He is someone politicians and the people 
could listen to. 
So what is the likelihood that Obama will announce on the steps of the Capitol on Monday that over 
these next four years he wants to make the arts a national priority and for that reason he is now 
nominating Sellars or Botstein to the newly created post of secretary of Culture? Zero. He's not crazy. 
Still, if Albania can have one, why can't we?

experience, gravitas, substance. He also had what was probably the best line in the
debate, saying that if Israeli voters were choosing a male model and not a Prime
Minister, Bibi might indeed be their man. Yet Bibi was much the more polished
performer, and the more focused. No matter what question Margalit asked him, he
almost invariably answered with the driving message of his campaign: that because
of Peres, Israeli citizens were living in fear, wondering where the next suicide
bomber would strike or the next Katyusha would land. And unavoidably, there was
another contrast as well: Bibi, who, after all, was 26 years younger, projected
greater youth, energy and confidence. When it was over, and Peres asked us how
he’d done, we all hemmed and hawed. Only Avraham Burg was prepared to offer a
clear verdict. He told Peres that Bibi had been the clear winner.

Still, it remained possible that Ramon’s football-game strategy might work.
Though Peres’s poll lead had been narrowing by the day, he was — just — ahead.
With a large number of voters undecided, however, Bibi pulled one final trick out
of his campaign bag. Under Israeli law, election spending is tightly regulated and
nearly all campaigning is barred during the last 48 hours before polling day. Yet
with the backing of wealthy overseas supporters, the Netanyahu campaign
suddenly flooded Israel with blue-and-white banners under the slogan: Bibi, Tov la
Yehudim. “Bibi is good for the Jews.” Would it swing tens of thousands of votes
among the Orthodox voters who were the main target? It was impossible to say.
But it seemed clear it was going to be a very close election.

I had worried for some time we might lose. That was why Nava and I had
persuaded Michal, our eldest daughter, to bring forward her wedding. She was
marrying her teenage boyfriend, a wonderful young man named Ziv Lotenberg.
They had originally planned it for a week later. But we did want to risk having it
overshadowed by an election defeat. The wedding took place in a beautiful area of
lawns and gardens called Ronit Farm, north of Herzliya. It was how weddings are
meant to be, full of smiles, good food and dancing. Near the end, Shimon showed
up. As he walked over to greet us, one guest after another shook his hand, patted
him on the back, hugged him, wished him luck. It was as if all the pressure and
tension of the campaign had suddenly flowed out of him. He smiled, returned the
embraces, even joined in the dancing. When he left, I told him that he’d done all he
could to secure victory, and that I hoped the voters would make the right choice.

The first exit polls suggested he was going to win. But our internal polling was
less clear. As more and more votes were counted, Shimon’s margin inexorably

The most important energy developments of 2012: how countries are planning for Independence Day

Il; Is Germany making an impetuous mad dash into renewable energy?

In the wake of Fukushima, Chancellor Merkel announced a plan to accelerate the closure of coal and nuclear power plants, with
the goal of relying more on renewable energy to fill the gap. Germany is by far the largest user of electricity in Europe and its
manufacturing to GDP ratio is high, so the consequences may be substantial. To get a sense of the potential impact, start with
the first chart on Germany’s current generating capacity and output by source. While wind and solar installations have increased
in recent years, their electricity output is less impactful due to wind and solar intermittency.

The two largest increases in Germany’s renewable plan are offshore wind and photovoltaic (solar). Offshore wind connections
are very expensive; according to Netherlands-based transmission system operator TenneT, they work out to ~1.1 million Euros
per MW, and that’s just for the connection (not the wind turbine itself, that’s extra). That offshore wind connection cost is
even higher than the 0.8-1.0 million per MW upfront capital cost of building new natural gas plants, using data from RWE AG
(Essen) and SWB AG (Bremen). Wind is free and natural gas isn’t, so we should look at all-in levelized costs” by electricity
source. As shown in the second chart, all things considered, offshore wind is a very expensive way for Germany to generate
electricity, and solar is higher by another order of magnitude. The relative ordering is similar in other countries.

Germany is a very energy-efficient country, and has among the lowest electricity-to-GDP ratios in Europe. However, the cost of
electricity to industrial consumers is already among the highest in Europe when including taxes, and for residential
consumers, Germany is the highest. As a result, the proposed shift to renewable energy may further increase electricity prices
for both residential and commercial users. There’s not enough data yet to measure the impact so far.

Germany’s goal: raise the contribution of renewable energy from 20% to 35% by 2020, and to 80% of total consumption
by 2050. The total cost of financing this transition is estimated at 800 billion Euros by DIW Berlin. The first stage, from now
until 2020, is supposed to cost 200 billion Euros. At a time when commitments to save Spain and the rest of the Periphery are

Europe (unlike in the US), levelized cost numbers also include a carbon footprint estimate @ $30 per tonne of COz.

Computer scientist

Joseph Redmon works on the YOLO algorithm, which combines the simple face detection of your phone camera with a cloud-based AI --
in real time.

Computer scientist Joseph Redmon is working on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm, which has a simple goal: to deliver image
recognition and object detection at a speed that would seem science-fictional only a few years ago. The algorithm looks like the simple face
detection of a camera app but with the level complexity of systems like Google's Deep Mind Cloud Vision, using Convolutional Deep
Neural Networks to crunch object detection in realtime. It's the kind of technology that will be embedded on all smartphones in the next
few years.

Redmon is also internet-famous for his resume.

Radhika Nagpal
Robotics engineer

Taking cues from bottom-up biological networks like those of social insects, Radhika Nagpal helped design an unprecedented “swarm” of
ant-like robots.

With a swarm of 1,024 robots inspired by the design of ant colonies, Radhika Nagpal and her colleagues at Harvard’s SSR research group
have redefined expectations for self-organizing robotic systems. Guided by algorithms, Nagpal’s shockingly simple robots guide
themselves into a variety of shapes -- an ability that, brought to scale, might lead to applications like disaster rescue, space exploration and
beyond.

In addition to her work with biologically inspired robots, Nagpal helped create ROOT, a simple robot to teach coding to would-be
programmers through a simple user interface suitable for students of all ages.

researchers and funds devoted to them. With quiet
stoicism, the Topics have accepted that modern medi-
cine may not have a solution for their daughters’ dis-
ease. Still, says Marijana, “Without hope, there’s no
life.”

Following a current grassroots trend in medicine,
many individuals with orphan diseases do not wait for
the medical industry to care about them. Facing long
odds, they are forced to raise money to find a potential
cure themselves. But the Topics live by modest means.
Maryana runs a daycare center and her husband and
the childrens’ father, Niko, works for a lumber com-
pany. They are in no position to mount a quest.

But then there’s Michele Wrubel, 49, a stay-at-home
parent from Connecticut who has calpainopathy. For
years, Wrubel has been a passionate crusader for a
cure. Affluent and well connected, she doesn’t varnish
the truth about what it has taken to make the medical
industry pay attention to her. “To make a difference in
this disease, you need money and meetings,” she says.
“Researchers are not going to study a disease unless
there’s money behind it to fund the research.” For the
Topics, Wrubel may be their best hope.

THE GLOBAL GENES PROJECT, an advocacy group,
estimates 350 million people suffer from orphan dis-
eases worldwide. Most rare diseases are genetic and
tend to appear early in life. About 30 percent of chil-
dren who have them die before reaching their fifth
birthday. The rest battle their conditions throughout
life, as most orphan diseases have no cure. Out of the
7,000 orphan diseases identified to date, with about
250 new ones added annually, less than 400 can be
treated therapeutically.

This year the European Commission gave 144
million euros to develop 200 new therapies and the

32

National Institute of Health allocated $3.5 billion to
research orphan diseases. Yet some diseases are so rare
that they remain stepchildren even among orphans.
As a result, they receive little research attention and
funding. Neither do they fit the list of billable msur-
ance procedures. There’s no standard healthcare path
to diagnosis, let alone treatment. Similar to the Topics,
many patients go through an ordeal, which Maryana
describes as “a blur,” only to find out that medicine
can’t help them.

Orphan disease organizations, such as the National
Organization for Rare Disorders and the Rare Disease
Foundation, encourage patients to take matters into
their own hands. “Families have to advocate,” says Isa-
bel Jordan, chair of the Rare Disease Foundation. She
encourages patients to form organizations, find new
methods of funding, and push for research.

“Push for research” could be Michele Wrubel’s call-
ing card. She was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy
in her mid-20s. But even though calpainopathy was
identified nearly 20 years ago—about the same time
Wrubel got her initial diagnosis—it took almost the
entire second half of her life to determine that she
was afflicted with calpainopathy. There were no clinical
procedures that would lead to a diagnosis.

“Tt took a really long time and a very concerted
effort,” says Wrubel, who walks with canes, submitting
to a wheelchair for long trips or when in crowded places.
“Tf you don’t know what you’re looking for, they don’t
know whatto tell you or how to help you,” she says.

In 2008, gene sequencing came of age, which aided
physicians in diagnosing muscular dystrophy subtypes.
That year, Wrubel’s husband, Lee, who holds a medical
degree and a master’s in public health from Tufts, an
MBA from Columbia University, and 1s a venture cap1-
talist in the medical field, tracked down a neurologist

output grow at the same rate. It confirms the standard teaching that balance is
possible, although not compelled, when growth rate is constant. It also shows that
balance is impossible when growth rate changes. No one disputes that capital
productivity (output/capital) always leads, and consumption rate
(consumption/capital) always lags, in accelerations up and down. Output gets the
bad news first and the good news first. What the equations leave unspecified is
where capital itself joins the sequence. That is what the evidence in the charts and

tables tells us.

In the case where the free growth index equals one, for example, the above

equations show

thrift gain

thrift index = —=0, implying
acceleration
— change in consumption rate
thrift gain = change in growth rate =0, and

change in consumption rate =0, or equivalently

consumption
consumption rate = oo = constant, (4.7)
capita

if acceleration is non-zero. (The reason for that qualifier is that zero acceleration

means zero change in growth rate, and division by zero is a no-no.)

In the opposite case where the thrift index is one, the same equations would show

b> EPSTEIN from 1B

using the name “Pimpin’
Made EZ.” Robson, who was
not charged in the case, is a
potential prosecution wit-
ness.

According to Recarey,
prosecutor Lanna Belohlavek
offered Epstein attorneys
Dershowitz. and Guy Fronstin
a plea deal in April. Fronstin,
after speaking with Epstein,
accepted the deal, in which
Epstein would plead guilty to
one count of aggravated as-
sault with intent to commit a
felony, be placed on five
years’ probation and have no
criminal record. The deal al-
so called for Epstein to sub-
mit to a psychiatric and sex-
ual evaluation and have no
unsupervised visits with mi-
nors, according to Recarey’s
report. The plea bargain was
made in connection with only
one of the five alleged vic-
tims, the report states.

Fronstin — who declined
to comment on the case —
‘ was subsequently fired and
veteran defense attorney
Jack Goldberger was hired.
He denies there was any

agreement by any of Ep-
stein’s attorneys to a plea
deal.

“We absolutely did not
agree to a plea in this case,”
he said. Neither Belohlavek
nor a_ state attorney’s
spokesman could be reached
for comment.

The parent or parents of
alleged victims who com-

plained of being harassed by
private investigators provid-
ed license tag numbers of two
of the men. Police found the
vehicles were registered to a
private eye in West Palm
Beach and another in Jupiter,
according to Recarey’s re-
port.

“I have no knowledge of
it,” defense attorney Gold-
berger said.

The report also says a
woman connected to the Ep-
stein case was contacted by
somebody who was still in
touch with Epstein. That
person told her she would be
compensated if she didn’t
cooperate with police, Re
carey’s report says. Those
who did talk “will be dealt
with,” the woman said she
was told. Phone records
show the woman talked with
the person who allegedly in-
timidated her around the
time she said, Recarey re-
ported.

Phone records also show
that the person said to have
made the threat then placed a
call to Epstein’s personal as-
sistant, who in turn called a
New York corporation affili-
ated with Epstein, the report
states.

The issue in the Epstein
case is not whether females
came to his waterfront home,
but whether he knew their
ages.

“He’s never denied girls
came to the house,” Gold-
berger said. But when Ep-
stein was given a polygraph

test, “he passed on knowl
edge of age,” the attorney
said.

After the indictment
against Epstein was unsealed
this week, Police Chief Reiter
referred the matter to the
FBI. “We've received the re-
ferral, and we're reviewing
it,” said FBI spokeswoman
Judy Orihuela in Miami.

The chief himself has
come under attack from Ep-
stein’s lawyers and friends in
New York, where he has a
home. The New York Post
quoted Epstein’s prominent
New York lawyer, Gerald
Lefcourt, as saying his client
was indicted only “because of
the craziness of the police
chief,”

Reiter has declined to
comment on the case. ,

Prosecutors have not
presented a sex-related case
like Epstein’s to a grand jury
before, said Mike Edmond-
son, spokesman for the state
attorney’s office. “That’s what
you do with a case that falls
into a gray area,” he said.

The state attorney’s office
did not recommend a partic-
ular criminal charge on

_ which to indict Epstein, Ed-

mondson said. The grand ju-
ry was presented with a list of
charges from highest to low-
est, then deliberated with the
prosecutor out of the room,
he said.

“People are surprised at
the grand jury proceeding,”
West Palm Beach defense
attorney Richard Tendler

said. “It’s a way for the pros-
ecutor’s office to not take the
full responsibility for not fil-
ing the (charge), and not do-
ing what the Palm Beach Po-
lice Department wanted. I
think something fell- apart
with those underage wit-
nesses.”

Defense attorney Robert
Gershman was a prosecutor
for six years. “Those girls
must have been incredible or
untrustworthy, I don’t know,”
he said.

Other attorneys said Ep-
stein’s case raises the issue of
whether wealthy, connected
defendants like Epstein —
whose friends include former
President Clinton and
Donald Trump — are treated
differently from others. Once
he knew he was the subject of
a criminal probe, Epstein
hired a phalanx of powerful
attorneys such as Dershowitz
and Lefcourt, who is a past
president of the National As-
sociation of Criminal Defense
Lawyers.

Miami lawyer Roy Black
— who became nationally
known when he successfully
defended William Kennedy
Smith on a rape charge in
Palm Beach — also was in-
volved at-one point.

Said defense attorney
Michelle Suskauer: “I think
it’s unfortunate the public
may get the perception that
with power, you may be
treated differently than the
average Joe.”

12.3 The Value of an Explicit Goal System

One of the subtle issues confronted in the quest to design ethical AGIs is how closely one
wants to emulate human ethical judgment and behavior. Here one confronts the brute fact
that, even according to their own deeply-held standards, humans are not all that ethical. One
high-level conclusion we came to very early in the process of designing CogPrime is that, just as
humans are not the most intelligent minds achievable, they are also not the most ethical minds
achievable. Even if one takes human ethics, broadly conceived, as the standard — there are
almost surely possible AGI systems that are much more ethical according to human standards
than nearly all human beings. This is not mainly because of ethics-specific features of the
human mind, but rather because of the nature of the human motivational system, which leads
to many complexities that drive humans to behaviors that are unethical according to their own
standards. So, one of the design decisions we made for CogPrime — with ethics as well as other
reasons in mind — was not to closely imitate the human motivational system, but rather to craft
a novel motivational system combining certain aspects of the human motivational system with
other profoundly non-human aspects.

On the other hand, the design of ethical AGI systems still has a lot to gain from the study
of human ethical cognition and behavior. Human ethics has many aspects, which we associate
here with the different types of memory, and it’s important that AGI systems can encompass
all of them. Also, as we will note below, human ethics develops in childhood through a series
of natural stages, parallel to and entwined with the cognitive developmental stages reviewed in
Chapter 11 above. We will argue that for an AGI with a virtual or robotic body, it makes sense
to think of ethical development as proceeding through similar stages. In a CogPrime context,
the particulars of these stages can then be understood in terms of the particulars of CogPrime’s
cognitive processes — which brings AGI ethics from the domain of theoretical abstraction into
the realm of practical algorithm design and education.

But even if the human stages of ethical development make sense for non-human AGIs, this
doesn’t mean the particulars of the human motivational system need to be replicated in these
AGIs, regarding ethics or other matters. A key point here is that, in the context of human
intelligence, the concept of a goal is a descriptive abstraction. But in the AGI context, it
seems quite valuable to introduce goals as explicit design elements (which is what is done in
CogPrime ) — both for ethical reasons and for broader AGI design reasons.

Humans may adopt goals for a time and then drop them, may pursue multiple conflicting
goals simultaneously, and may often proceed in an apparently goal-less manner. Sometimes the
goal that a person appears to be pursuing, may be very different than the one they think they’re
pursuing. Evolutionary psychology [BDL93] argues that, directly or indirectly, all humans are
ultimately pursuing the goal of maximizing the inclusive fitness of their genes — but given the
complex mix of evolution and self-organization in natural history [Sal93], this is hardly a general
explanation for human behavior. Ultimately, in the human context, goal is best thought of
as a frequently useful heuristic concept.

AGI systems, however, need not emulate human cognition in every aspect, and may be
architected with explicit goal systems. This provides no guarantee that said AGI systems will
actually pursue the goals that their goal systems specify — depending on the role that the goal
system plays in the overall system dynamics, sometimes other dynamical phenomena might
intervene and cause the system to behave in ways opposed to its explicit goals. However, we
submit that this design sketch provides a better framework than would exist in an AGI system
closely emulating the human brain.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016414.txt,"Already, a policy debate is raging. Backers are urging people to reserve judgment and say
the tax breaks have galvanized cities, businesses and investors to think creatively about
boosting parts of the country most in need. Critics say the incentives were poorly
calibrated and may amount to a boondoggle far in excess of the official $1.6 billion
projected cost.

Americans may have to wait months or years to learn which side is right. That’s because
the law doesn’t require investors to disclose projects, making it difficult to tell which areas
are benefiting the most.

But there’s plenty of evidence that a boom is brewing. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which
already had an investment team focusing on struggling communities, has disclosed about
$150 million in projects in recent months. Purchases of sites inside opportunity zones
spiked as the tax law took effect, outpacing growth in other areas, according to Real
Capital Analytics, which tracks property sales. Altogether, investors spent 62 percent more
on properties eligible for tax breaks in the 12 months through September, compared with
those in the same census tracts a year earlier, its data show.

Here are snapshots of what’s happening across America:

Bronx Boost

Port Morris Distillery, which makes a high-alcohol rum called pitorro, was the perfect spot
for an opportunity zone pitch. It’s on a block with a colorful mural, industrial buildings
ready for loft conversions and views of the Manhattan skyline. Much of the surrounding
South Bronx is now an opportunity zone.

“We have always been the most ignored,” Marlene Cintron, the borough’s head of
economic development, told an audience of developers and lawyers in November. “These
opportunity zones are here for you to take advantage of them.”

The case for the Bronx, where incomes are among the lowest in New York, is that it’s the
last borough awaiting revitalization. The tax incentives are designed to unleash it. If
developers can buy at current Bronx prices, before seeing a Brooklyn-like rise, the breaks
would be massive.

on their foreheads, would have all the surrealistic flavor of a Lenny Bruce
fantasy.

Since he often talked on stage about his environment, and since
police cars and courtrooms had become his environment, the content of
Lenny's performances began to revolve more and more around the
inequities of the legal system. “In the Halls of Justice,” he declared, “the
only justice is in the halls.” But he also said, “I love the law.” Instead of
an unabridged dictionary, he now carried law books in his suitcase. His
room was cluttered with tapes and transcripts and photostats and law
journals and legal briefs.

Once he was teasing his ten-year-old daughter, Kitty, by pretending
not to believe what she was telling him. “Daddy,” she said, “you'd
believe me if it was on tape.”

Lenny's jazz jargon was gradually being replaced by legal jargon. He

But what I discovered there was that when
sarah Kellen was asked about Alan Dershowitz, she took
the Fifth and she wasn't the only one. There was
Miss Mucinska who also took the Fifth when asked
questions about Alan Dershowitz.

And then there was Marcin -- Miss Marcinkova
who also took the Fifth. So what we -- what I had at
this point was Jeffrey Epstein's international sex
trafficking organization. I had the next echelon and
both the top kingpin of the sex trafficking organization
and the next echelon had taken the Fifth, had refused to
answer questions about Alan Dershowitz.

And so at that point, I was drawing an
adverse inference, not just from one person, but from
four persons and that adverse inference was being
strengthened by the surrounding circumstances, some of

(a department of the China International Publishing Group) saw its cooperative

agreements dwindle.

It was then that Chinese officials revived an old tactic that the Communist Party
had employed before the revolution—using friendly foreigners and pro-PRC Chinese
immigrants to publicize China’s story. Chinese officials called this tactic of localizing

the work of foreign propaganda, the “borrowed boat” strategy.”

One such friendly American was a China scholar*® who was for years associated

with Random House. According to Huang Youyi, the chief editor of the Foreign
Languages Press posted to the United States in the late 1980s and early 1990s, this
American argued that for China to improve its image in the United States, it needed to
work through American organizations, and so he collaborated with Huang on a book
series, “The Culture and Civilization of China,” which the Yale University Press began
publishing in 1997, The American’s “understanding of the US publishing industry and
his friendly attitude towards China became an indispensable condition for the success
of the cooperation,” Huang wrote.*! Books from the series are still given to foreign

guests of the Beijing government.

In a period of deep crisis for China’s reputation, Huang’s success in using foreigners

to publish material beneficial to China’s image became a model for other Chinese
operations. From the early 1990s, the Chinese Communist Party began to seek
opportunities to cooperate with Westerners, Western media and publishing companies,

and overseas Chinese to tell its story.

Lack of Reciprocity

It is important to compare Beijing’s efforts to “grab the right to speak” and obtain
“discourse power” overseas with the efforts, and ability, of Western media organizations
to access China’s market to a similar degree. For decades, those efforts have faced
roadblocks placed in their path by the Chinese government. A key roadblock has been
China’s ban on Western investment in media except when it involves such things as

fashion, cars, and lifestyle.

Private media

Unlike the United States, where Chinese reporters are only restricted from entering

high-security military installations, Western reporters in China are subject to a panoply

right camps. So far, Macron has fostered a good rapport with
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whom we expect to be re-
elected in September. The political risk in continental Europe
is now centered in Italy, but we were encouraged that its far-
left Five Star Movement suffered key defeats in recent regional
elections, which could bode well for their next national elec-
tion, likely to occur next spring.

In addition to Italy, Brexit remains a large political risk for
2018 as the weakened Tories will be negotiating with at best
a tenuous alliance with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP)
and at worst may face another election and lose power alto-
gether. We believe it is too soon to make major portfolio shifts
based on Brexit, but we are watching this closely as substan-
tial progress in negotiations will need to materialize months
ahead of the March 2019 deadline. By this time next year, we
would expect to see traction in negotiations and stability in
Parliament or begin to consider reducing exposure to the Brit-
ish pound and companies exposed to that economy.

Aging Business Models

The “FANG” stocks—Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google
—have disrupted countless business models while seeing their
own revenues and market values soar. Empty storefronts from
Manhattan to malls in Middle America are evidence of the
disruption facing rapidly aging business models like brick-and-
mortar retail. When you include Apple and Microsoft in the
FANG stocks, the six companies account for 12.83% of the S&P
500 Index. At the start of this bull market on March 9, 2009,
these companies had a market value of $326 billion. Today,
their market value is $2.97 trillion. Their sheer size alone
suggests that they cannot keep compounding like they have. To
maintain its ascent, the U.S. bull market will need new sectors
to emerge as market leaders. The challenge will be economic

growth. Companies that disrupt mature businesses, like many
of the FANG stocks have, typically have not relied on a robust
global economy to generate their amazing revenue growth.
Most other sectors in the S&P 500 Index, however, would likely
benefit from a stronger economy.

Summary and Conclusion

Many bull markets have interesting back stories as to how they
begin and end. The latest bull market can arguably be traced
back to March 9, 2009 when the CEO of Citibank, Vikram
Pandit, released a memo to employees announcing that the
company was having its best quarter since early 2007. The
market embraced that memo as a sign the worst was over,
especially for the beleaguered banking sector. The S&P 500
rallied from that day and eight years later is up nearly four-fold.
As we consider future returns, valuation matters. In March
2009, the S&P 500 was selling for roughly 10 times depressed
earnings and is now selling for about 18.7 times. The U.S.
market leads the world in innovative companies and is priced
for it.

As we look for opportunities overseas, we see political fortunes
improving in Europe with some lingering headwinds that may
appear in 2018. We could argue the same in the U.S. as the
leadership in the House of Representatives can easily switch
parties next year. If Europe can continue its economic improve-
ment, we see the potential for more gains ahead for the region
after a robust start to 2017.

The emerging markets offer some attractive valuations, but are
not likely to be a panacea for global growth as the largest ones
face the same challenges of aging and maturing development
that confront most of the developed world. This bull market
may keep moving, but like all of us past a certain age, not at a
pace that we are used to. @

MOTION BY MS. GREENBERG TO GIVE THE VIOLATOR AN
EXTENSION OF TIME UNTIL APRIL 24, 2008 TO COMPLY
SECONDED BY MS. VAN BUREN

MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY

C. Case # 08-2471, 240 Park Avenue, Park Avenue Palm Beach LLC
Violation of Chapter 42, Section 42-86, of the Town of Palm Beach Code of
Ordinances, properties are required to be maintained in good condition and
unsightly, unsafe or unsanitary conditions are not permitted and Chapter 42,
Section 42-87, all exterior walls to be maintained in good repair and interior walls
and ceilings shall be structurally sound.

Lead Code Officer Walton advised this property had been found in non-
compliance at the last hearing, assessed administrative costs in the amount of
$150.00 and given one (1) day to comply. Compliance has not been achieved so
the Town recommends a $250.00 a day fine. He said he has met with the Chief
Financial Officer of the corporation that owns the property and that individual was
present today to address the Board.

Dan Gorman was sworn in by Recording Secretary Houston and said he had
become aware of this violation after the fact. He said they had been going back and
forth with the Town about what to do with the property at 240 Park Ave. He said
it was a disheveled rooming house when they took it over and they began to
rebuild it to its old glory. As recently as three weeks ago, an associate of his met
with the Town to discuss whether to continue to do the eighteen room
hotel/boarding house or convert

it into a single family residence. As a result of that, the original permits lapsed.
They then went to the Bahamas to work on another project and did not get the
notices. They have a new group of contractors, Principal Design and
Development Building, who are going to re-file the permits. He requested an
extension of time as they have done everything they can without permits. Mr.
Walton said the Town was requesting a fine of $250.00 a day to begin on March
22, 2008. In response to questions from Board members, Mr. Gorman said they
had decided to continue with the rooming house zoning and they had consultants
and financing in place. He anticipated the project, at least the exterior, would be
completed within 30 days and the interior portion, three to four months after that.

Mr. Hoffman advised he was not in favor of granting any extensions in this case
and Mr. Ochstein agreed.

Hicks had been elevated to White House communications director, with
Raffel as her number two.

The trouble had arisen the previous summer. Both Hicks and Raffel
had been on Air Force One in July 2017 as the news broke about Donald
Trump Jr-s meeting in Trump Tower during the campaign with Russian
government go-betweens offering dirt on Hillary Clinton. During the
flight back to the United States after the G20 summit in Germany, Hicks
and Raffel aided the president in his efforts to issue a largely false story
about the Trump Tower meeting, thus becoming part of the cover-up.

Even though Raffel had been at the White House for a little more than
nine months, the Axios report said that his departure had been under dis-
cussion for several months. That was untrue. It was an abrupt exit.

The next day, just as abruptly, Hope Hicks—the person in the White
House closest to the president—resigned as well.

The one person who perhaps knew more than anyone else about the
workings of the Trump campaign and the Trump White House was sud-
denly out the door. The profound concern inside the White House was
the reasonable supposition that Hicks and Raffel, both witnesses to and
participants in the president's efforts to cover up the details of his son and
son-in-law’s meeting with the Russians, were subjects or targets of the
Mueller investigation—or, worse, had already cut a deal.

The president, effusive in his public praise for Hicks, did not try to
talk her out of leaving. In the weeks to come he would mope about her
absence—“Where’s my Hope-y?”—but, in fact, as soon as he got wind
that she might be talking, he wanted to cut her loose and began, in a
significant rewrite, downgrading her status and importance on the cam-
paign and in the White House.

Yet here, from Trump's point of view, was a hopeful point about Hicks:
as central as she was to his presidency, her duties really only consisted of
pleasing him. She was an unlikely agent of grand strategy and great con-
spiracies. Trumps team was made up of only bit players.

e+

John Dowd may have been reluctant to give his client bad news, but
he well understood the danger of a thorough prosecutor with virtually

SIEGE

unlimited resources. The more a determined team of G-men sifts, strit
and inspects, the greater the chance that both methodical and cast
crimes will be revealed. The more comprehensive the search, the mc
inevitable the outcome. The case of Donald Trump—with his history
bankruptcies, financial legerdemain, dubious associations, and genei
sense of impunity—certainly seemed to offer prosecutors something
an embarrassment of riches.

For his part, however, Donald Trump yet seemed to believe that |
skills and instincts were at least a match for all the thoroughness a
resources of the United States Department of Justice. He even believ
their exhaustive approach would work in his favor. “Boring. Confusi
for everybody,’ he said, dismissing the reports of the investigation pr
vided by Dowd and others. “You can't follow any of this. No hook?

One of the many odd aspects of Trump's presidency was that
did not see being president, either the responsibilities or the exposu
as being all that different from his pre-presidential life. He had endur
almost countless investigations in his long career. He had been involv
in various kinds of litigation for the better part of forty-five years. He w
a fighter who, with brazenness and aggression, got out of fixes that wot
have ruined a weaker, less wily player. That was his essential busin:
strategy: what doesn’t kill me strengthens me. Though he was wound
again and again, he never bled out.

“It's playing the game,” he explained in one of his frequent mor
logues about his own superiority and everyone else's stupidity. “I’m go
at the game. Maybe I’m the best. Really, I could be the best. I think I<
the best. I’m very good. Very cool. Most people are afraid that the wo
might happen. But it doesn’t, unless you're stupid. And I’m not stupid?

In the weeks after his first anniversary in office, with the Muel
investigation in its eighth month, Trump continued to regard the s}
cial counsel's inquiry as a contest of wills. He did not see it as a war
attrition—a gradual reduction of the strength and credibility of the t
get through sustained scrutiny and increasing pressure. Instead, he sav
situation to confront, a spurious government undertaking that was v
nerable to his attacks. He was confident he could jawbone this “wit
hunt”—often tweeted in all-caps—to at least a partisan draw.

five-year interim period had yet to begin. In one respect, I had some sympathy for
Bibi’s predicament. The reason I'd tried to get Yitzhak to alter the terms of Oslo II
was that it required us to hand back control before we knew what a “permanent-
status” peace deal would look like. But where my sympathy ended was in how Bibi
handled the situation. Despite my concerns about the way the Oslo process had
been designed, I never doubted that killing it off would be by far a worse
alternative. Bibi had been elected to /ead Israel. Instead, he acted as if he was
playing some sort of pinball match, flipping the ball first one way, then the other,
with no obvious aim beyond keeping it in play — and, where Oslo was concerned,
simply stalling for time. Rather than setting out any vision of where he hoped to
move the negotiating process, he seemed more concerned with keeping the right-
wing of Likud and the smaller, even more extreme parties from turning against
him.

In late September 1996, Bibi and the Likud mayor of Jerusalem, Ehud Olmert,
decided to go ahead with the festive opening of an archeological tunnel that
provided access to a larger portion of the Western Wall of the ancient Jewish
temple. It was a decision that, under both Rabin and Peres, we’d delayed out of
concern about inflaming tensions with the Palestinians. As Shimon rightly said
publicly after the three days of violence that followed, we understood that, at a
minimum, it would need to be coordinated beforehand with Arafat. As the unrest
spread into the West Bank and Gaza, there were media warnings of a “new
intifada, ” the difference this time being that the Palestinians newly established
police had entered the fray. By the time urgent US diplomacy, our efforts and
Arafat’s, brought it to a close, 25 Israeli soldiers and nearly 100 Palestinians had
been killed. He did not slam the brakes altogether on the American-led efforts to
move ahead with the Oslo. In early 1997, in fact, he and Arafat reached a separate
agreement on the critically important question, and potential flashpoint, of Hebron.
It stipulated that about 80 percent of the area would be under Palestinian authority,
with Israel retaining control and responsibility for nearby settlements and key
security points. Despite right-wing and settler opposition, it was approved by a
wide margin in the Knesset, with Labor’s backing. But a few months later, in the
spring of 1997, Hamas launched a new campaign of suicide bombings in shopping
areas of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, leaving 24 people dead. While not suggesting that
Bibi took the human cost of terror lightly, he did use the attacks to drag out further
US-mediated talks on the details of implementing the Oslo I redeployments.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014565.txt,"when China’s leadership intervened in the local
equity markets and adjusted the trading band
around the renminbi, and by 104 basis points in
late 2015 and early 2016 when the leadership
changed the reference currency from the dollar to a
basket of 13 currencies. If US financial conditions
had stayed at those levels for over a year, US
GDP growth would have slowed by about one
percentage point, all else being equal. Financial
conditions are the mechanism by which shocks
from China would have the most immediate

impact on key developed economies such as the US.

As mentioned above, one of the triggers of
US recessions has been economic imbalances.
While we do not see such imbalances in the US,
or in other major developed economies, at this
time, we see significant imbalances in China. Such
imbalances have led to crises in other countries,
and there is no reason to believe that they will not
lead to a financial crisis in China. In our view, it is
not a question of if—it is only a question of when.

The biggest imbalance in China is the high level
of debt relative to GDP. The Bank for International
Settlements (BIS) has a series of early warning
indicators. One of the more widely followed
and reliable measures is the credit-to-GDP gap,
measured as the total credit extended to the
private nonfinancial sector as a percentage of GDP
compared with its long-term trend. As shown in
Exhibit 27, China breached the high-risk threshold
in June 2012, when its credit-to-GDP gap rose
above the 10% level. At 30.1% as of March
2016 (latest data available) and rising, China’s
gap exceeds the 10% threshold by 20 percentage
points, levels previously seen in Spain before the
European sovereign debt crisis. Major developed
and emerging market countries have experienced a
financial crisis within three years of their credit-to-
GDP gap exceeding 10%.

In our 2016 Outlook and our 2016 Insight
report, Walled In: China’s Great Dilemma, we
stated that we did not expect a hard landing in
China over the next two years—2016 and 2017.
We continue to assign a low probability to a hard
landing in China in 2017. However, it is unlikely
that China can avoid a financial crisis over the
next three years. In prior years, we have pointed to
China’s high savings rate and government control
of many aspects of the economy as reasons for
its ability to avert a hard landing. However, the
country’s debt levels have risen rapidly, the pace
of capital outflows has picked up, and net foreign

direct investment has reversed and is now negative.
In our view, neither China’s high savings rate nor
its increasing government control of financial
markets and capital flows will be sufficient to avert
a hard landing over the next several years. Keep
in mind that even the US was not able to avert a
financial crisis after its credit-to-GDP gap briefly
breached the 10% high-risk threshold in December
2006 and peaked at 12.4% in December 2007.
The US has the highest GDP per capita of any
major country in the world. The large countries
that come closest to the US on this score have
GDP per capita levels that stand at about 70% of
US levels on a nominal basis and slightly higher
on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis. The US
dollar is also the unquestioned reserve currency
of the world; its reserve-currency status has only
been fortified after the Eurozone sovereign debt
crisis and the British referendum for Brexit. Thus,
the US is able to access the excess savings of the
entire world. The US also receives the largest share
of world foreign direct investment flows, capturing
14% of global flows between 2011 and 2015.
The US now accounts for 20% of the stock of all
foreign direct investment. Yet, despite all these
major advantages, it did not avert a financial crisis
in 2008. It defies logic to assume that China will
be the one major country that avoids a financial
crisis and a hard landing when it does not enjoy
such advantages. As we often say, stating that “this

This attitude shift proved universal across the region. Iraq was almost
never mentioned, nor was 9/11 or al Qaeda, and rather than rail at
what America had imposed on them, the young Arabs instead
criticized how America reacted to them. (President Obama’s failure
to support Egyptian revolutionaries until after Mubarak was clearly a
goner, and his inconsistency helping Libya’s rebels, but not Syria’s,
were both widely criticized.) By taking control of their own fates, in
reality and perception—highly important in this prideful culture—the
conversation has become more respectful and adult.

So it was that in 2011 I found myself having the kind of dialogue that
Hi, whose funding was pulled in 2005, had always aspired to have.
Over lunch in the dark basement of Tabouleh, a restaurant in Cairo’s
Garden City, seven Egyptian bloggers, including many of the digital
heroes of the Tahrir Square Facebook revolution, debated U.S.
subsidies to Egypt. “We don’t want money,” says one blogger, Safa.
“We want to make sure we go the right way.” No, counters Ahmad,
“we need the money, but it must be with no strings attached.”
Eventually, the talk turns to nuts-and-bolts democracy, the real
Jefferson-Hamilton stuff (one of the bloggers, Karim, had already
requested a translated copy of the Constitution): federalism, the role
of the military, and, above all, the peaceful transfer of power that
inspires quadrennial awe worldwide.

Such technology-fueled enlightenment comes with an equally
perilous downside, as evidenced by my conspiracy-minded Beirut
coffee-shop friend. Ask this group, or any others about basic political
facts—al Qaeda’s responsibility for 9/11, or the death of Osama bin
Laden—and even the most educated, whether blogger or student or
lawyer, will start popping off inanities. “Aw, they’re sick about
plots,” Gibran Tueni, the Western-oriented editor of Beirut’s Al-
Nahar had warned me on my first trip to the region, less than two
years before he was killed by a car bomb. “Whenever they see

The Origins of al-Qaeda

As alleged in plaintiffs’ pleadings and confirmed by countless governmental investigations, al-Qaeda has its origins in the
jihad against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, which served as a rallying point for *25 Islamic extremists in the Middle
East.’ In 1980, Osama bin Laden traveled to Afghanistan to participate i the jihad, and gained prominence for his role in
establishing the financial and logistical infrastructure that sustained the mujahedeen fighters.

Bin Ladin understood better than most of the volunteers the extent to which the continuation and eventual success of the jihad
in Afghanistan depended on an increasingly complex, almost worldwide organization. This organization included a financial
support network that came to be known as the “Golden Chain,” put together mainly by financiers in Saudi Arabia and the
Persian Gulf states. Donations flowed through charities or other non-governmental organizations (NGOs).°

Together with Abdullah Azzam, bin Laden founded the Maktab al Khidmat (“Office of Services”) to facilitate the provision
of financial and logistic support to the mujahedeen.’ Throughout the Afghan jihad, Maktab al Khidmat worked in concert
with a network of purported charities and relief organizations, including the Muslim World League (“‘MWL?”), International
Islamic Relief Organization (“IIRO”), Rabita Trust, Al Haramain Islamic Foundation (“Al Haramain”), Muwafaq Foundation
*26 (“Muwafaq”), and the Saudi Red Crescent Society, to provide travel documents, funds, transportation, training facilities,
arms, physical assets and other support to the mujahedeen.'° Fueled by donations from wealthy supporters in Saudi Arabia
and the Gulf, this network of ostensible charities established a vast infrastructure to support the mujahedeen opposition to the
Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.

At the conclusion of the Afghan jihad, bin Laden determined that the network that supported the mujahedeen in Afghanistan
should not be abandoned, but rather adapted to serve as a foundation for waging a global jihad against all of the perceived
enemies of Islam, and in particular, the United States.'!? As the 9-11 Commission explained:

*27 April 1988 brought victory for the Afghan jihad. Moscow declared it would pull its military forces out of Afghanistan
within the next nine months. As the Soviets began their withdrawal, the jihad’s leaders debated what to do next.

Bin Ladin and [Abdullah] Azzam agreed that the organization successfully created for Afghanistan should not be allowed to
dissolve. They established what they called a base or foundation (al Qaeda) as a potential general headquarters for future
jihad.

Once al-Qaeda was established, bin Laden turned its focus towards the United States. This was not done secretly, but rather
publicly, in a series of fatwas. “Bin Ladin began delivering diatribes against the United States before he left Saudi Arabia [in
1991]. He continued to do so after he arrived in Sudan. In early 1992, the Al Qaeda leadership issued a jihad against the
Western ‘occupation’ of Islamic lands...[s]pecifically singling out U.S. forces for attack.”“ In a 1996 fatwa, tellingly entitled
“Declaration of War against the Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Places,” bin Laden asserted that “the
occupying American enemy is the principle and the main cause of the situation. Therefore efforts should be *28 concentrated
on destroying, fighting and killing the enemy until, by the Grace of Allah, it is completely defeated.” In 1998, bin Laden
proclaimed to the world:

The ruling to kill Americans and their allies - civilians and military - is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in
any country in which it is possible to do.

These fatwas ensured that those who provided support to al-Qaeda knew and understood that al-Qaeda was directing its
conduct at the United States.

The thing is, I don't feel attacked or diminished or anything else by this article. Despite
the fact that I'm a guy, I have insecurities and I can in some places see a stupid,
obnoxious mirror of myself in Clarisse's dumb ex boyfriends -- that isn't at all why I
thought I should talk about the topic more with the author. It just seemed to me like
Clarisse hadn't quite got her head around what the guys were going through with their
side of this interaction. Where their insecurities came into play.

In my head, I see a young woman, working through her own issues with orgasms reading
this, and seeing her young boyfriend reflected in Clarisse's past relationships. And the
take away from Clarisse's experience at the moment seems to be that if your boyfriend is
insecure and stupid, maybe he's not the right person to work through this with you. And
I'm not sure that's doing anyone any favors. I mean shit, maybe that is what you should
take away from reading this -- that the guy you're with isn't the right person for you right
now if you're struggling with difficulty achieving orgasm. But maybe there are other
stories going on as well. Maybe he's insecure about his role and his failings (or his body
or whatever) and maybe he could be the right guy to work through this with you, if you're
the right person to work through his insecurities with him?

And please, please don't take that to mean let things slide because you don't want to
emasculate him. I'm not for a moment advocating putting up with nonsense because he's
a guy with a precious male ego. But lots of guys, certainly including myself, have
personal insecurities, about masculinity and about sexuality, and attached to the
perceptions of masculinity in sexual situations. As a guy, we're all taught that real men
don't give head -- or at least that it's a private thing that we don't admit too -- which is so
fucking stupid, but is still really out there in heteronormative western male culture. We're
all taught that getting a woman off is our job, and to be a good man, and a good lover,
we have to get our partner off before we get off. I don't know a single sexually active guy
who has never felt humiliated because he came too early, and too early is largely defined
as before our partner gets off. And we're all taught that real men get their partners off
with nothing but the awesomeness of our cocks. Hand jobs/digital penetration are fine
for highschool or fore play -- but our image of a good man, and a desirable lover doesn't
integrate with those things. We're coached by pop culture and porn to believe that the
guy every woman wants is the one who sticks his cock in and makes her explode with joy
from the very first thrust. And any time that doesn't happen, the guy is at fault.

And again, to stress my position here, I think all of those things are stupid, illogical
nonsense. But those are the pressures that are on guys. And maybe, if the guy that you're
with is struggling to work through your orgasm issues, maybe it's because he's so far
under the weight of his own insecurities that he doesn't know how to cope with his own
issues, and be a supportive partner to work through yours. But the thing about a good
relationship, is that together you're stronger than the sum of your individualities. Maybe
as a couple, you can work through his insecurities and your orgasm difficulties at the
same time. Nobody's problems exist in a vacuum, and sometimes finding the support you
need is easier if you just fix the support you already have.

Alison Gopnik

Alison Gopnik is a developmental psychologist at UC Berkeley; her books include The
Philosophical Baby and, most recently, The Gardener and the Carpenter: What the New
Science of Child Development Tells Us About the Relationship Between Parents and
Children.

Everyone’s heard about the new advances in artificial intelligence, and especially
machine learning. You’ve also heard utopian or apocalyptic predictions about what those
advances mean. They have been taken to presage either immortality or the end of the
world, and a lot has been written about both those possibilities. But the most
sophisticated Als are still far from being able to solve problems that human four-year-
olds accomplish with ease. In spite of the impressive name, artificial intelligence largely
consists of techniques to detect statistical patterns in large data sets. There is much more
to human learning.

How can we possibly know so much about the world around us? We learn an
enormous amount even when we are small children; four-year-olds already know about
plants and animals and machines; desires, beliefs, and emotions; even dinosaurs and
spaceships.

Science has extended our knowledge about the world to the unimaginably large
and the infinitesimally small, to the edge of the universe and the beginning of time. And
we use that knowledge to make new classifications and predictions, imagine new
possibilities, and make new things happen in the world. But all that reaches any of us
from the world is a stream of photons hitting our retinas and disturbances of air at our
eardrums. How do we learn so much about the world when the evidence we have is so
limited? And how do we do all this with the few pounds of grey goo that sits behind our
eyes?

The best answer so far is that our brains perform computations on the concrete,
particular, messy data arriving at our senses, and those computations yield accurate
representations of the world. The representations seem to be structured, abstract, and
hierarchical; they include the perception of three-dimensional objects, the grammars that
underlie language, and mental capacities like “theory of mind,” which lets us understand
what other people think. Those representations allow us to make a wide range of new
predictions and imagine many new possibilities in a distinctively creative human way.

This kind of learning isn’t the only kind of intelligence, but it’s a particularly
important one for human beings. And it’s the kind of intelligence that is a specialty of
young children. Although children are dramatically bad at planning and decision making,
they are the best learners in the universe. Much of the process of turning data into
theories happens before we are five.

Since Aristotle and Plato, there have been two basic ways of addressing the
problem of how we know what we know, and they are still the main approaches in
machine learning. Aristotle approached the problem from the bottom up: Start with
senses—the stream of photons and air vibrations (or the pixels or sound samples of a
digital image or recording)—and see if you can extract patterns from them. This
approach was carried further by such classic associationists as philosophers David Hume

The artist Paul Klee often talked about art as “making the invisible visible.” In computer
technology, most algorithms work invisibly, in the background; they remain inaccessible
in the systems we use daily. But lately there has been an interesting comeback of
visuality in machine learning. The ways that the deep-learning algorithms of AI are
processing data have been made visible through applications like Google’s DeepDream,
in which the process of computerized pattern-recognition is visualized in real time. The
application shows how the algorithm tries to match animal forms with any given input.
There are many other AI visualization programs that, in their way, also “make the
invisible visible.” The difficulty in the general public perception of such images is, in
Steyerl’s view, that these visual patterns are viewed uncritically as realistic and objective
representations of the machine process. She says of the aesthetics of such visualizations:

For me, this proves that science has become a subgenre of art history. ... We
now have lots of abstract computer patterns that might look like a Paul Klee
painting, or a Mark Rothko, or all sorts of other abstractions that we know from
art history. The only difference, I think, is that in current scientific thought
they’re perceived as representations of reality, almost like documentary images,
whereas in art history there’s a very nuanced understanding of different kinds of
abstraction.

What she seeks is a more profound understanding of computer-generated images
and the different aesthetic forms they use. They are obviously not generated with the
explicit goal of following a certain aesthetic tradition. The computer engineer Mike
Tyka, in a conversation with Steyerl, explained the functions of these images:

Deep-learning systems, especially the visual ones, are really inspired by the need
to know what’s going on in the black box. Their goal is to project these
processes back into the real world.

Nevertheless, these images have aesthetic implications and values which have to
be taken into account. One could say that while the programmers use these images to
help us better understand the programs’ algorithms, we need the knowledge of artists to
better understand the aesthetic forms of AI. As Steyerl has pointed out, such
visualizations are generally understood as “true” representations of processes, but we
should pay attention to their respective aesthetics, and their implications, which have to
be viewed in a critical and analytical way.

In 2017, the artist Trevor Paglen created a project to make these invisible AI
algorithms visible. In Sight Machine, he filmed a live performance of the Kronos Quartet
and processed the resulting images with various computer software programs used for
face detection, object identification, and even for missile guidance. He projected the
outcome of these algorithms, in real time, back to screens above the stage. By
demonstrating how the various different programs interpreted the musicians’
performance, Paglen showed that AI algorithms are always determined by sets of values
and interests which they then manifest and reiterate, and thus must be critically
questioned. The significant contrast between algorithms and music also raises the issue
of relationships between technical and human perception.

VI. S&M, Redux

I finally came into my BDSM identity around age 20. At first, when I was faced with the
fact that I wanted to be hurt until I cried and begged for mercy, I freaked out. I had no
idea what to do about BDSM, no idea how to feel about it. The only thing I knew for sure
was that I'd found something I really needed. But what did that mean for me, when I was
also trying hard to be an independent, rational feminist with self-esteem and integrity?

It took me years to parse out my thoughts on feminism and BDSM, to feel comfortable
with BDSM, and to talk openly and comfortably about it. During that process, I got better
and better at finding partners who were interested in my sexual desires and willing to
experiment. I also got to the point of reading sexuality advice books on my own,
including books specifically on BDSM. (For recommendations, please check the notes at
the beginning of this book.)

And I gritted my teeth, forced down my anxiety, and looked into books about the female
orgasm.

One book that came highly recommended from Amazon.com was Lonnie Barbach's For
Yourself. By the time I was halfway through the first chapter, I was crying because what
she wrote felt so true. At the end of the first chapter, I put it down and was never able to
pick it up again. Barbach wrote compassionately about experiences very similar to mine
-- for instance: /Are you afraid to talk to your partner about your problem] because
you're embarrassed to ask for what you want at a particular time; afraid your partner
will refuse, get angry, or feel emasculated?

But she also ended the first chapter this way: You have to assume responsibility and be
somewhat assertive. Our culture has taught us that a woman should depend on a man to
take care of her, which means she can blame him for any mistakes. It's nice to be driven
around in a car, but it's also nice to be able to drive yourself so you can go where you
want to, when you want to. But to do that, you'd have to assume some responsibility.

It was the same let go and keep trying” advice I'd been coming across for years, except
that now it was wrapped up in a nice package of assumptions about me: implications that
I wasn't assuming responsibility or being assertive. I felt like she was telling me that I
chose to depend on a man to take care of me.

Maybe it would have been okay if the rest of the chapter hadn't been so miserably true,
but the combination of reading a bunch of truth about how I was feeling -- then being told
that I wasn't trying hard enough, that I was choosing to avoid responsibility.... It was
toxic.

I also had the bright idea of asking my gynecologist. The doctor rolled her eyes as I
spoke, then told me that the problem was obviously my partners. When I insisted that I

Today, the morning group praying, evening hymn singing, Christian Republican
Right Wing feed their feelings of being on the side of God by dividing people into
those that are like them and good and those that President Bush and Attorney
General John Ashcroft calls the evil doing “bad guys.” As noted previously,
psychoanalytic theory posits that the evil doing others may represent the projected
repository of our own unacceptable impulses and inclinations. It became quite clear
in my own psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic training that it is in healing our split
and knowledge of our own unacceptable things that will lead to our understanding
and forgiveness of others.

As we dig deeper into global brain-mind dynamics of emergent high-energy
fixation, stuck repetitiousness and splitting, we encounter their universality in the
structures of mathematical thought. Did we just make them fit? Do these thought
forms map onto internal and external physical reality? Are these abstract concepts
and operations simply products of our biological brains manifested as psychological
mechanics and used to explain to ourselves what we perceive and think? Does a
square have external reality or is it a universally imagined something, and, as such,
represented only in our minds and the pictures of it we draw? Is mathematical
understanding simply inborn perceptual skills combined with developed and
practiced logical cognition? Or, do we take the Platonic view of mathematical
relations: these abstractions are the ultimate realities, antedating and persisting
through the past, present and future of the universe and omnipresent.

Where can the conceptual boundary be drawn between the physical reality of
the Babylonian surveyors use of the Pythagorean theorem to calculate distances,
that the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two legs of a right triangle is equal
to the square of the length of its hypotenuse, and its abstract, pencil-marks-on-
paper, algebraic development as in the definition of Pythagorean numbers, a,b, and
c such that a*+ b*= c*. The dichotomy between the abstract and concrete,
consistently blurred in our work, is between a natural science with ideas that can be
disconfirmed, directly or indirectly, by experimental observation and the thinking of

mathematics as an a priori field in the sense of Kant. The modern Platonic view

It’s a tale (practically) as old as time. When New York City real estate thrives, home
builders and buyers seek to colonize neighborhoods previously deemed undesirable.

The Financial District was once the exclusive domain of nine-to-fivers; these days,

every other office building is a condominium. Along the Hudson River, midtown s #_

Manhattan used to be an industrial no-man’s-land of warehouses and strip clubs. ABC's David Muir nicknamed
‘Anchor Monster’

No more — residential projects abound. And now the Upper East Side neighborhood
dubbed Yorkville, which stretches from about 72nd to 96th streets east of Third
Avenue, is ready for its turn.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014571.txt,"Last year witnessed a growing repudiation of
this status quo, evident in the surprise outcome
of the UK and Italian referenda, as well as US
presidential election. As we begin 2017, these
winds of change are gaining force. Central banks
are acknowledging the often counterproductive
impact of ultra-easy monetary policy and
shifting attention to the eventual withdrawal of
accommodation. At the same time, the recovery
in commodity prices and recent firming in global
growth is shifting the focus from deflation to
reflation. The same could be said of the increasing
focus on expansionary fiscal policy.

While this change brings hope, it also carries
risk. In the US, fiscal stimulus arrives eight years
into an economic expansion that is already near
full employment, increasing the danger of the
economy overheating. Although the Federal
Reserve could respond by hastening the pace
of rate hikes, it might overdo it. Similarly, an
overzealous negotiating stance on existing trade
relationships or imposition of protectionist policies
by the incoming US administration could staunch
the flow of trade—an outcome that would be
particularly damaging to emerging markets. And
in Europe, a victory of the far right in the French
presidential election could unleash fears about
France exiting the European Union and endanger
the survival of the euro.

Still, we do not yet accord a high enough
probability to these risks to alter our base case,
which assumes these winds of change fill the sails
of the ongoing global recovery, rather than capsize
it (see Exhibit 29).

United States: Age Is Just a Number

The US economic expansion is getting old by
historical standards. At nearly eight years, it is
already the fourth-longest in post-WWII history
and poised to be among the top three by the
middle of this year (see Exhibit 30). Concern that
the economy’s vigor is finally succumbing to its
advanced age was only bolstered by anemic 1.6%
real GDP growth in 2016, close to the weakest of
any year during the recovery.

But as we have argued in the past and as
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen recently noted,
“it’s a myth that expansions die of old age.”!°
Instead, business cycles are typically derailed by

“irredeemably flawed operation.” Historically,

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025031.txt,"As these narratives (“Our courts will never allow that,” “As a superpower we will always be able to win any
fight we put our minds to,” “Assimilation will ensure Muslims are westernized” ...) gain consent from
others they tend to guide us deeply and become infused on our policies. Ultimately, what emerges is a
relationship we take with our Islamic Enemy that parallels that between an addict and an enabler.
Emblematic of this relationship is the “transfer of responsibility” in which we assume responsibility for the
enemy’s behavior who is addicted to transferring it away from itself. The Control Factor actively maintains
this relationship and makes changing that relationship as difficult a chore as any addict finds in breaking his
addiction. And just as an addict needs to devote serious effort and con sciousness to his addiction, so must
we devote great energy to unders tanding how the Control Factor ultimately sabotages us.

FP: Describe the threat we face in our Islamic enemy. And you talk about the three levels of jihad against
us. What are they?

Siegel: Simply stated, our Islamic Enemy seeks the totalitarian domination of Islam throughout the world —
Islamic supremacy. It seeks to have the West submit to Islam. Obviously, this does not mean that everybody
becomes a Muslim. Islam, in all its varied expressions, permits dhimmis- those Christians, Jews, and some
others who are permitted to remain as protected non-Muslims as long as they submit to an inferior status.
What is critical is that Shariah (Islamic Law) ultimately rules the world.

Jihad, loosely, is the effort/struggle to see this vision through. The most obvious method of Jihad is through
violence; it is the one most familiar to most Westerners and almost all of the Koranic references to Jihad are
based in violence. The Violent Jihad includes al-Qaeda and its offshoots as well as other groups that
formed around the globe independent of al-Qaeda. It also obviously includes the violence from Islamic
nations such as the Islamic Republic of Iran whose constitution specifies such vision. It also includes,
however, various militant groups and training camps here in the US as well as ad hoc efforts of individuals.

Since 9/11, there have been something in excess of 15,000 Violent Jihadic attacks across the globe.
However, as terrible as this is, we have a tendency in the West to think that the only dimension of threat we
face comes from violence. While the Bush administration helped initiate this thinking, the Obama
administration has actively abused it by limiting any discussion of the threat we face to al-Qaeda and some
other terrorist groups abroad. As frightening as these groups are, we can get some ease from thinking they
are a band of “extremists limited in number, weaponry, sophisticati on, and means. Stunningly, Hillary
Clinton recently estimated that there are only about 50,000 “homicidal” violent extremists around the world
who simply have been able to project power much greater than their number should allow. Here the Control
Factor makes the threat appear more easily manageable.

Jihad, however, is pursued in other often even more effective ways which I have grouped into three
“levels.” A second more insidious level of threat is what the Muslim Brotherhood itself called the
“Civilization Jihad.” It is the effort to infiltrate all aspects of our society, peacefully according to our laws,
in order to later be in position to sabotage and destroy it from the inside. The Civilization Jihadists have
learned the culture and rules of the territories they seek to command and use those rules to maneuver—
specifically using our freedoms to destroy our freedoms. They use “lawfare” to seek changes in our laws so
as to push Shariah into our society. Your readers should read Daniel Pipes and Brooke Goldstein’s Lawfare
Project material and others to fully appreciate how cancerous this activity has become. This includes
intimidating in a variety of ways anyone who speaks out against them or Islam and seeking to squelch our
treasured broad right to free speech so as to ultimately prevent any criticisms of Islam. Once criticism of
Islam is prohibited, little can stop it from cascading throughout the culture.

The Civilization Jihad includes situating such Jihadists in critical positions in the society, in the
government, in the legal system, the military, and elsewhere. It includes the control over university
programs that distribute propaganda about Islam and Islamic history which then filters down throughout
textbooks for even younger students. It includes control over most of the nation’s mosques and local Imams
guiding the mess ages engaged Muslims are receiving. Most troublesome are the Muslim g roups (CAIR,
ISNA, MSA and others associated and/or joint venture partners with the Muslim Brotherhood) supposedly
interested in “outreach” which know how to appear Westernized and interested in the goals of Western
Civilization. They have fooled a large part of our authorities and media due in part to their patience and

sorts of things.

So you start to look at the flight logs and
you see what's going on is not just events that are
occurring in Florida, but it's occurring on a multi
state basis which now starts to make it a federal crime.
For example, we are seeing evidence that -- let's just
talk about Virginia Roberts since she's central to this
case.

We are seeing Virginia Roberts being flown
from Florida to New York where she's in the clutches of
Jeffrey Epstein who is sexually abusing her, you know,
many times a week. And not just Jeffrey Epstein, but
other powerful persons, for example, Ghislane Maxwell is
there with him on all of these flights and apparently
being involved in the abuse.

Indeed -- and so you have you have -- you
have -- you have that. You also start to see on the
flight logs, what to my mind are some very sinister
things, suggesting that the pattern is not just confined
to sort of, you know, the girls that are there in

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023405.txt,"In re: TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001., 2012 WL 257568 (2012)

York, courts determine the “threshold question” of whether a duty of care exists “by balancing factors, including [1] the *141
reasonable expectations of parties and society generally, [2] the proliferation of claims, [3] the likelihood of unlimited or
insurer-like liability, [4] disproportionate risk and reparation allocation, and [5] public policies affecting the expansion or
limitation of new channels of liability.” Hamilton v. Beretta U.S_A. Corp., 96 N.Y.2d 222, 232 (2001), opinion after certified
question answered, 264 F.3d 21 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A defendant may have a duty
of care with respect to a third-party’s actions “where there is a relationship either between defendant and a third-person
tortfeasor that encompasses defendant’s actual control of the third person’s actions, or between defendant and plaintiff that
requires defendant to protect plaintiff from the conduct of others.” Jd. at 233. For example, New York recognizes the doctrine
of negligent entrustment, whereby

One who supplies directly or through a third person a chattel for the use of another whom the supplier
knows or has reason to know to be likely because of his youth, inexperience, or otherwise, to use it in a
manner involving unreasonable risk of physical harm to himself and others whom the supplier should
expect to share in or be endangered by its use, is subject to liability for physical harm resulting to them.

Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965), § 390. See Splawnik v. DiCaprio, 540 N.Y.S.2d 615, 616-17 (N.Y. App. Div. 1989)
(citing the negligent *142 entrustment doctrine and holding defendant liable for leaving gun with suicide victim because “the
supplier owes a duty to foreseeable parties to withhold the chattel from the entrustee’).

Here, where defendants are alleged to have known -- or at least been on notice of facts supporting a conclusion regarding --
the terrorist nature of the al-Qaeda network they supported, the factors weigh overwhelmingly in support of a duty of care. As
the Seventh Circuit has concluded, lending material support to a terrorist organization, even without knowledge of its
activities, satisfies the elements of negligence. Boim IT, 549 F.3d at 693. A fortiori, providing support while knowing the
character of the terrorist organization is like giving “a gun you know is loaded to a child .... [D]oing so is reckless and if the
child shoots someone” the defendant “will be liable to the victim” even under the higher standard for recklessness. Id.

Analogously, in Sickles v. Montgomery Ward & Co., a department store was held liable for negligence when an employee
sold an air rifle to a father, knowing that it was intended as a gift to his son, and the son later shot the eye of another child.
167 N.Y.S.2d 977 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1957). The court found that the store clerk “should have known” it to be irresponsible *143
to sell the rifle, not only because of the “known propensities of young children in whose possession firearms are placed,” but
also because the sale “was specifically proscribed by the Penal Law” and violated the “legislative policy of the State.” Jd. at
979. Nor did the fact that the defendant sold the rifle to the father, rather than the boy directly, changes the analysis. Jd. (“The
naked legality of the sale to the parent, also in pari delicto, does not operate to relieve the defendant from liability.”)
(emphasis added).

Here, plaintiffs allege that defendants gave material support to persons and organizations they had every reason to suspect
were terrorists, and did so either directly or through front institutions -- in clear violation of the United States’ policies
against such actions. See Companion Brief at Point LA. The “reasonable expectations of parties and society generally” and
“oublic policies affecting the expansion” of liability therefore weigh heavily in favor of recognizing a duty of care. Hamilton,
96 N.Y.2d at 232. Moreover, recognizing a duty would not give rise to a “likelihood of unlimited or insurer-like liability” or
a “proliferation of claims” because the class of potential claimants is restricted to those injured by terrorist attacks and “does
not extend beyond that limited class of plaintiffs to members of *144 the community at large.” Jd. at 232-33. Finally,
imposing a duty of care on those who provide material support to terrorists makes sense as a matter of “risk and reparation
allocation,” id. at 232, because “[d]amages are a less effective remedy against terrorists and their organizations than against
their financial angels.” Boim IT, 549 F.3d at 690.

As for plaintiffs’ NIED claims, the district court itself recognized that under New York law, NIED may be established under
the “bystander theory,” whereby a defendant is negligent for conduct that is “a substantial factor in bringing about injuries to

starting in 1990, the State Council’s Overseas Chinese Affairs Office gave $800,000
a year to SinoVision, ultimately increasing its subsidy to between $2 million and

$3 million a year. Wang made this charge in a 2011 letter to the Overseas Chinese
Affairs Office alleging widespread corruption at the station.*° Allegations of corruption

and governmental subsidies have not been corroborated.

What is clear, however, is that, like Qiaobao, SinoVision’s content echoes China’s
official media. The vast majority of its stories about China, Sino-American relations,
Taiwan, Hong kong, and other important issues for the PRC government are taken
directly from official Chinese media outlets or websites, including CCTV, Xinhua,
and the People’s Daily. In an essay, Qiaobao’s Eastern Group president, You Jiang,
defended his paper’s support of the PRC’s agenda by saying that it stemmed not
from Beijing’s direction, but from demands from pro-Chinese immigrants in the

United States.”

Forays by PRC organizations to assert direct control over Chinese-language media in
the United States sparked a battle with publications owned by private interests from
Taiwan and Hong Kong that did not share the PRC’s ideological bent. PRC officials
openly acknowledged the political nature of this battle, and in a 2007 interview, Guo
Zhaojin, the president of the state-owned China News Service, noted that if China
could gain control of Chinese-language publications in the United States, China would
be better able to influence the overseas Chinese community, have a say in American
politics, and “protect the national image.” Guo further observed that more than one-
quarter of America’s minorities relied on foreign-language media to obtain their news,

Foreign-language media, said Guo, was a “giant hiding in plain sight.””8

Beijing seems to be winning the battle with Chinese-language outlets expressing views
that dissent from Beijing’s. Over the course of the last twenty years, a series of once-
independent Chinese-language media have fallen under Beijing’s control. The Sing Tao
Newspaper Group was established in Hong Kong in 1938. In the mid-1990s, its original
owner”? was forced to divest of interests in the paper, and it was soon taken over by
a pro-PRC businessman,*° who, starting in 1998, became a member of the Chinese
People’s Political Consultative Conference, which functions as part of the broader
united front organization network. Sing Tao’s coverage of China is clearly now aligned
with that of state-run media from Beijing. In fact, in May 2001, the year he purchased
Sing Tao, the owner established a joint venture with the Xinhua News Agency to create

an information-service company known as Xinhua Online.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012097.txt,"A “Vixing” Puzzle

Equity volatility has been unusually low for much of 2017.
The Volatility Index (VIX), which measures the implied
volatility of S&P 500 Index options and has been viewed
as a barometer of equity market volatility, has drifted to
all-time lows. Over a span of more than 7,000 sessions
going back to the start of 1990, the VIX Index’s average
and median closing values have come out to 19.4 and 17.6,
respectively. It was a rare occurrence for the VIX to
collapse below 10 — there were only 9 such occasions out
of 6,802 trading sessions prior to 2017, or 0.13% of the
times. Year-to-date in 2017, however, there were already
35 sessions with the VIX closing below 10.

Another way to look at the lack of volatility is to tally the
number of trading sessions when the S&P 500 Index had
a daily change of more than 1% in either direction. There
were only 8 such sessions so far in 2017, compared to 48
and 72 such occasions in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

It seems ironic that the market should be this steady with
arguably the most mercurial and unconventional
president in modern history at the helm atop the free
world. Perhaps investors have grown numb to all the
chaos and controversies. It is as if Washington’s
dysfunction and a divided America were just fodder for
the hyperventilating media, and markets were behaving
as if all will be fine when the Republicans pass the tax
reform to prime the pump for the 2018 mid-term
elections. Time will tell if this period of eerie calm is
prescient or misguided.

Unintended Consequences

The decline in market volatility has made shorting against
the VIX futures and various VIX ETPs (exchange-traded
products) quite popular and profitable in recent years.
The net short position on VIX futures has progressively
climbed to new highs over the last couple of years.
Another phenomenon was the rise of “volatility control”
investment strategies, supposedly favored by many hedge
funds and insurance companies. These strategies in
essence adjust a portfolio’s allocation between equity and
cash to maintain a targeted level of volatility at the
portfolio level. In an environment of declining volatility,
more assets would be allocated to equities — the equity

allocation would even exceed 100% when the market’s
realized volatility is below the targeted volatility. On the
other hand, as volatility ticks up, the equity allocation
would be scaled back.

While these strategies have enjoyed strong returns during
this stretch of progressively lower equity volatility, they
may be planting the seeds of a market correction. Market
makers and dealers on the other side of the growing short
VIX trades would need to employ various S&P 500 option
strategies to hedge their long VIX positions. There is the
concern that a decline in the S&P 500 Index could trigger
adjustments to these hedging positions that would
exacerbate the market decline. Similarly, should volatility
suddenly spike up, the aforementioned volatility control
strategies would be cutting equity
concurrently, which could amplify the market decline
similar to the downward selling pressure that the so-
called portfolio insurance products generated during the
crash of 1987. We wonder if any investors and regulators
truly appreciate how these strategies, in concert with
various rapid fire trades generated by machine-learning
based algorithms, could impact market movement and
liquidity should there be an exogenous shock. Only time
will tell.

exposures

Fear vs. Greed

There is an adage that one should be fearful when others
are greedy and greedy when others are fearful. Judging by
the depressed levels of the VIX Index, the enthusiastic
speculation over bitcoin as well as other variants of
cryptocurrencies, and surveys that indicated strong
investment sentiment, it is clear that greed has been on
the rise. Can this euphoria continue for a while longer? Of
course. However, in our opinion, the combination of
elevated investor complacency and a tightening Fed
makes the market vulnerable to a pullback, though the
timing of it is hard to predict. The aforementioned issues
with various trading strategies could further add fuel to
fire in the event of a market decline. That said, with the
macro and earnings backdrop remaining positive, we
would view potential selloffs as a buying opportunity
rather than the start of a protracted market downturn. e

"
IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013131.txt,"12.4 Ethical Synergy 215

Thus, empathic “ethics of care” involves a combination of episodic and sensorimotor ethics,
complementing the mainly declarative ethics associated with the “ethics of justice.”

In Gilligan’s perspective, the earliest stage of ethical development occurs before empathy
becomes a consistent and powerful force. Next, the hallmark of the conventional stage is that
at this point, the individual is so overwhelmed with their empathic response to others that
they neglect themselves in order to avoid hurting others. Note that this stage doesn’t occur
in Kohlberg’s hierarchy at all. Kohlberg and Gilligan both begin with selfish unethicality, but
their following stages diverge. A person could in principle manifest Gilligan’s conventional stage
without having a refined sense of justice (thus not entering Kohlberg’s conventional stage); or
they could manifest Kohlberg’s conventional stage without partaking in an excessive degree of
self-sacrifice (thus not entering Gilligan’s conventional stage). We will suggest below that in fact
the empathic and logical aspects of ethics are more unified in real human development than
these separate theories would suggest. However, even if this is so, the possibility is still there
that in some AGI systems the levels of declarative and empathic ethics could wildly diverge.

It is interesting to note that Gilligan’s and Kohlberg’s final stages converge more closely
than their intermediate ones. Kohlberg’s post-conventional stage focuses on universal rights,
and Gilligan’s on universal compassion. Still, the foci here are quite different; and, as will be
elaborated below, we believe that both Kohlberg’s and Gilligan’s theories constitute very partial
views of the actual end-state of ethical advancement.

12.4.3 An Integrative Approach to Ethical Development

We feel that both Kohlberg’s and Gilligan’s theories contain elements of the whole picture of
ethical development, and that both approaches are necessary to create a moral, ethical artificial
general intelligence — just as, we suggest, both internal simulation and uncertain inference are
necessary to create a sufficiently intelligent and volitional intelligence in the first place. Also,
we contend, the lack of direct analysis of the underlying psychology of the stages is a deficiency
shared by both the Kohlberg and Gilligan models as they are generally discussed. A successful
model of integrative ethics necessarily contains elements of both the care and justice models, as
well as reference to the underlying developmental psychology and its influence on the character
of the ethical stage. Furthermore, intentional and attentional ethics need to be brought into
the picture, complementing Kohlberg’s focus on declarative knowledge and Gilligan’s focus on
episodic and sensorimotor knowledge.

With these notions in mind, we propose the following integrative theory of the stages of
ethical development, shown in Tables 12.4, 12.5 and 12.6. In our integrative model, the justice-
based and empathic aspects of ethical judgment are proposed to develop together. Of course, in
any one individual, one or another aspect may be dominant. Even so, however, the combination
of the two is equally important as either of the two individual ingredients.

For instance, we suggest that in any psychologically healthy human, the conventional stage
of ethics (typifying childhood, and in many cases adulthood as well) involves a combination
of Gilligan-esqe empathic ethics and Kohlberg-esque ethical reasoning. This combination is
supported by Piagetan concrete operational cognition, which allows moderately sophisticated
linguistic interaction, theory of mind, and symbolic modeling of the world.

And, similarly, we propose that in any truly ethically mature human, empathy and rational
justice are both fully developed. Indeed the two interpenetrate each other deeply.

Are you aware that the police report reflects
that the woman I referred to who was hired to give
massages, told them that she never touched anyone
inappropriately?

A. LIthink that there are -- there is
information along those lines in the police report, yes.

Q. Okay. And so do you acknowledge that the
police report, on its face, reflects both reports of
massages that involved improper sexual contact --
contact and massages that were perfectly legitimate?

A. Yes, but not in the same proportion.

Q. My question wasn't proportion. The -- the
report on its face, you understood, reflected that there
were massages given at Mr. Epstein's residence that were
perfectly legitimate?

A. Some -- it was basically a few isolated
examples from what I could see,

Q. So you would characterize what was said in
the police report as a few isolated examples?

A. Well, given the backdrop that they had --

Q. No. My question -- it's a yes or no
question. Is that how you would characterize it?

MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me. The witness is not
confined to answering yes or no, if yes or no
would be misleading.

BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. It's a different position than was taken
previously, but --

A. Imean, I was just going to give one
sentence, and the one sentence would be, in the context
of this whole police report where they had 24,
approximately, minor girls who were -- who were being
sexually abused, the references to legitimate massages I
would view as isolated.

Q. So you're coming to the conclusion, looking
at the police report, that they are isolated; is that
right?

A. Yes.

Q. And do you think a fair-minded reader of the
police report would reach that conclusion?

A. Absolutely.

Q. And were you aware that the police report, to
give a bit more detail, reflected that a woman who was
described as having tattoos was hired to give
deep-tissue Swedish massages. Do you recall that being
in the -- in the police report?

A. Something along those lines, yes.

Q. And she also -- that woman also told the
police that she was not Jeffrey Epstein's type, that she
wasn't thin, had tattoos, didn't fit his type?

A. That sounds accurate with the information I

have, yes, she doesn't sound like she would fit his

type.
Q. And so do you agree with me then --

A. And she's over the age of 18, which is
another reason why wouldn't fit his type, so...

Q. But you acknowledge that -- that this
woman -- that the police report reflects a woman over --
well over the age of 18, being hired to give perfectly
legitimate massages, correct?

A. Yeah. That was cover for the sex trafficking
that was going on.

Q. Okay. So you're now -- does the police
report say it was cover --

A. That was --

QQ. -- for the sex trafficking?

A. That was my conclusion when I reviewed the
materials.

Q. Okay. So your inclusion is that a
fair-minded reader of the police report would come to
that conclusion?

A. December 30th of 2014, knowing what we know
now, yes.

Q. Do you consider yourself a very suspicious

A. No.

Q. Do you consider yourself a conspira -- having
a conspiratorial view?

A. Absolutely not.

Q. Do you consider yourself a crusader?

A. Well, crusader for justice, I would say, yes.

Q. If -- let me put it this way: In your view,
is evidence that a person, any person, any guest at
Mr. Epstein's house had a massage, evidence that that
person engaged in criminal sexual conduct, contact with
minors, because of the fact of having a massage?

A. You'd have to look at the context.

Q. On its own, is it any evidence -- doesn't
it -- is it any evidence at all, in your view?

A. It would be some evidence, yes.

Q. Notwithstanding that the report, on its face,
reflects both legitimate and illegitimate massages?

A. The report on its face, let's be clear,
reflects a lot of illegitimate sag -- massages anda
sporadic or isolated, you know, legitimate massages. So
the fact that somebody gets a massage in that context,
I-- I think is -- is -- raises, you know, the concerns
we have been talking about.

Q. Did you, before December 30th of 2014,
yourself personally, review what I think you referred to

liberals to attempt an end run around the referendum. The people
made a choice, and we have to respect it, he says.

The Brotherhood, meanwhile, is sitting pretty. It has offered to form a
broad coalition with liberals and leftists in the elections, and
promises that there will be no attempt to hijack the constitutional
reform process afterward. The new constitution has to be written by
all Egyptians, says Essam Erian, a top Brotherhood leader. No one
group should have a louder voice than the others. This makes the
Islamists look responsible and conciliatory, and is likely to play well
with voters. (See more on the Brotherhood's election strategy in posts
to come.)

In Iraq, it took the liberals years to catch up with the religious parties
in organizational and campaigning skills. In the last election, Allawi
finally cobbled together a coalition that won more seats than any
other group, only to be outmaneuvered by postelection horse trading.
If Egypt's liberals aren't careful, a similar fate awaits them.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017530.txt,"KEITH BLACK

Keith L. Black (born September 13, 1957) is an American
neurosurgeon specialising in the treatment of brain tumors
and a prolific campaigner for funding of cancer treatment.
He is chairman of the neurosurgery department and
director of the Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California.

Keith Black was born in Tuskegee, Alabama. His
mother, Lillian, was a teacher and his father, Robert, was the
principal at a racially segregated elementary school in Auburn,
Alabama; prohibited by law to integrate the student body,
Black’s father instead integrated the faculty, raised standards,
and brought more challenging subjects to the school. Later in
his childhood, Black’s parents found new jobs and relocated
the family to Shaker Heights, Ohio. Black attended Shaker
Heights High School. Already interested in medicine, Black
was admitted to an apprenticeship program for minority
students at Case Western Reserve University, and then became
a teenaged lab assistant for Frederick Cross and Richard
Jones (inventors of the Cross-Jones artificial heart valve) at
St. Luke’s Hospital in Cleveland. At 17, he won an award ina
national science competition for research on the damage done
to red blood cells in patients with heart-valve replacements.
According to Black: “I was working in the lab of a heart surgeon
who had developed his own artificial heart valve, and Ihad a
concept that the heart valve might be damaging red blood cells,
so I asked to do a research project using a scanning electron
microscope at the time. When I was trying to basically learn
the technique, I took some blood from the heart-lung bypass
machine from patients undergoing heart-lung bypass, and
when I incubated the red blood cells overnight, I noticed that
a certain percentage of these cells change from their normal
discoid shape to one that resembled a porcupine, called an
econocyte. What I did was to describe the discocyte-econocyte
transformation in patients undergoing heart-lung bypass, as
an index of sub-lethal red blood cell damage. The importance
being that the blood cells could not parachute through the
small capillaries.” He attended the University of Michigan in
a program that allowed him to earn both his undergraduate
degree and his medical degree in 6 years. He received his M.D.
degree from the University of Michigan Medical School in 1981.

After serving his internship and residency at the

University of Michigan, in 1987 he moved to the UCLA
Medical Center in Los Angeles, where he later became head
of UCLA’s Comprehensive Brain Tumor Program. In 1997,
after 10 years at UCLA, he moved to Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center to head the Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute.
He was also on the faculty of the University of California,
Irvine School of Medicine from 1998 to 2003. In 2007 he
opened the new Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. Brain Tumor Center
at Cedars-Sinai, a research center named after the famous
lawyer who had been Black’s patient and supporter.

Black has been a frequent subject of media reports
on medical advances in neurosurgery. He was featured
in a 1996 episode of the PBS program The New Explorers
entitled “Outsmarting the Brain”. Esquire included him in
its November 1999 “Genius Issue” as one of the “21 Most
Important People of the 21st Century.” He has been cited as
an expert in reports about whether mobile phone use affects
the incidence of brain tumors. He is also noted for his very
busy surgery schedule: a 2004 Discover article noted that he
performs about 250 brain surgeries per year, and that at age 46
he had “already performed more than 4,000 brain surgeries,
the medical equivalent of closing in on baseball’s all-time
career hits record.” (As of 2009, Black’s surgery count had risen
to “more than 5,000 operations for resection of brain tumors”.)

In 1997, Time magazine featured Black on the
cover of a special edition called “Heroes of Medicine”. The
accompanying article described Black’s reputation as a
surgeon who would operate on tumors that other doctors
would not, as well as aspects of his medical research,
including his discovery that the peptide bradykinin can
be effective in opening the blood-brain barrier.

In 2009 Black published his autobiography, co-
authored with Arnold Mann, entitled Brain Surgeon. New
York Times reviewer Abigail Zuger described the book as a
“fascinating, if somewhat stilted, memoir”. The Publishers
Weekly review commented that the book “examines
racial hurdles he had to leap to become a neurosurgeon”
and “alternat[es] incisive writing about incisions with
his personal memoir, insightful and inspirational.”

EUROPEAN MULTI ASSET COVERAGE MEETING IMPRESSIONS: Eyes on Real Money outflows; 
Christmas comes early for most of macro players, hedge funds. Absolute majority bet on HRC to win, but 
majority still made good money because Hillary bets worked as Trump trades. 
Wider, steeper core rates, stronger USD, weaker EM is the Rage. The last one, EM, is the big loser out of 
Trump Reflation Theme. DM over EM and divergence within DM are very much in vogue. All gains of EMBI 
since March are gone! 
For Rates & FX, it does feel like early days of Taper Tantrum trade of 3 years ago. Both dominated by US price 
action. In both, hedge funds have now caught the moves, play offense & ride the Trump narrative. Real Money 
is on the ropes, caught long Fixed Income/duration/carry and cannot play defense fearing Outflows. 
In Emerging Markets, most outflows are retail, ETF driven. All eyes on next leg of institutions. In equities, 
banks big winners; FANGs losing. I asked partners 2 questions. 1) Would the this will be great for business, 
feel good factor wave out-run if real yields go up, equities are a sell fear. Clients are torn, but the former, 
bullish camp wins for now, my colleagues suggest. There are skeptics though. 
2) In Europe, do fears over Renzi losing & Le Pen winning climb over the big momentum behind banks etc. 
Again, my equity team suggests, no, reflation wave may win over Italy referendum anxiety„ for now. Renzi is 
now widely expected to lose, so a yes would be the big surprise trade. And the bigger elephant in the room is 
Le Pen. If she wins in May, Europe as we know it may really shake.. But for now this is more in the radars of 
Euro & EBG traders. 
Core rates are driven by the speed of TY sell-off. And in G5 FX, the big driver is USD/JPY. The stronger we 
should believe in Trump reflation narrative winds are, the more USD/JPY buyers we see. 
Some in Research warn that Trump may succeed in tax cuts, faster than any infrastructure spending, but few 
macro are in mood to listen. A few players believe, looking at trade weights of each with US and magnitude of 
sell-off, Asia FX may have more weakness to come than MXN. Will copper/infrastructure rally eventually help 
Chile? 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 023635 
Most macro love NKY, willing to love it more. Bringing it home; fast macro money players are rushing to erase 
losses, year long pains through wider rates, longer USD, weaker EM, stronger equities. 
Real Money is in defensive, remembering Taper Tantrum days, fearing institutional outflows & forced selling 
of carry hope positions. 
Those who want to fade Trump rally, seek valuation in EM, believe core rates can tighten to get a breather are 
in Minority.

do,” says Weingarten.

Shortly after Weingarten leaves, Epstein tells me that Eric Holder will
resign by the end of the week—which he does.

Epstein summons in the next person cooling his heels in the ante-
room. It’s a young man named Brook Pierce, a former child actor, and
dotcom high flyer—a principle in a gaming company called DEN, a
notorious dotcom burnout, with its own sex scandal—who is now a leading
investor in Bitcoin. He describe himself as the “the most active investor in
the field.”

And, indeed, is the first clear explanation I actually get about Bitcoin.
It is so good that Epstein stops him and checks to see if his next appointment
is here. And seconds later, Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary and
President of Harvard, enters the dining room. Summers, off Diet Coke, digs
deep into the Shakes chocolates, focuses in on the Bitcoin investor.

“Okay,” he says, after listening for a bit, “I have opportunities here.
But an additional feature of my decision problem roughly speaking 1s that
the worst that could happen to you is that you could lose all the money you
put into it. Whereas, I could go—I mean I don’t look that great now—but I
could go from being seen as a figure of some probity and some intelligence
to being a figure of much less intelligence and much less probity...”

“Well,” says Pierce in what in some dramatic understatement, “you
are going to have some low quality characters playing the space...”

That evening, there is a small cocktail party, which includes the former
Prime Minister of Australian, Kevin Rudd, and Thorbjorn Jaglandthe head
of the Noble Peace Prize Committee, who offers an affable, but general
scathing, critique of U.S. diplomacy (and a brief defense of Obama’s Peace
Prize award) and to whom Epstein offers a ride back to Europe on his jet.

The next morning, it’s Ehud Barack, the former Israeli Prime Minister
and Israel, for breakfast. Barack is, over his omelet, able to defend both
Obama and Putin. Then Kathy Ruemmler, who has just left her job as White
House Counsel joins. She is already in the mix as a possible next attorney
general, but, in fact, will withdraw from consideration in part to work with
Epstein.

Larry Summers wife, Elisa New, drops by. She teaches American
poetry at Harvard and is putting together a proposal for a series on poetry
that WGBH in Boston may produce and Epstein is advising on where she
might go for added support (he also makes mince meat of her budget).

Fig. 11.8: The Reflexive Stage

stage adds an entire new feedback loop for reasoning about inference control itself, as shown in
Figure 11.8.

As a very concrete example, in later chapters we will see that, while PLN is founded on
probability theory, it also contains a variety of heuristic assumptions that inevitably introduce a
certain amount of error into its inferences. For example, PLN’s probabilistic deduction embodies
a heuristic independence assumption. Thus PLN contains an alternate deduction formula called
the “concept geometry formula’ that is better in some contexts, based on the assumption that
ConceptNodes embody concepts that are roughly spherically-shaped in attribute space. A highly
advanced CogPrime system could potentially augment the independence-based and concept-
geometry-based deduction formulas with additional formulas of its own derivation, optimized
to minimize error in various contexts. This is a simple and straightforward example of reflexive
cognition — it illustrates the power accessible to a cognitive system that has formalized and
reflected upon its own inference processes, and that possesses at least some capability to modify
these.

In general, AGI systems can be expected to have much broader and deeper capabilities for
self-modification than human beings. Ultimately it may make sense to view the AGI systems
we implement as merely “initial conditions for ongoing self-modification and selforganization.
Chapter ?? discusses some of the potential technical details underlying this sort of thorough-
going AGI self-modification.

Yes, they are the new iterations of Ghislaine Maxwell; for you Richard Beckler, this originated from 
my being a former Stone Ridge classmate of his elder daughter Katie Beckler, and because he was 
on the Board of Stone Ridge during this period in time when my every family, friend, acquaintance 
and association was being contacted, bribed in one form or another, and turned against me (see 
below); as for Ken Adams, it stemmed from my having contacted him for representation in my 2011-
filed case against IBM also during this period of time when my every communication were being 
tracked. 
You both are interesting; you let us see what's to become of the Scalia 35 (see below; at bottom, 
Ghislaine Maxwell's Jeffrey Epstein in context.) 
We start from this following precept: (the repeating 9/11s) 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 017590 
1. Toward a New World Order speech by Pres. George H.W. Bush — 9/11 (1990) 
2. WTC Attack — 9/11 (2001) 
3. BENGHAZI Attack — 9/11 (2012) 
But you have to remember that H. W. Bush was planted: 
AUTHOR PETER DALE SCOTT: Sometimes you have little deep events that most people don't even 
notice. One of those would be the Halloween Massacre. The older people remember the Saturday 
Night Massacre which happened under Nixon. I'm talking about the Halloween Massacre of October 
31, 1975, and probably people watching this show have never heard of it. 
That was under Ford, and Ford may have condoned it because it was trying to help restore his 
popularity. He was going way down in the polls. But it was a very important series of events all on 
the same night. The head of the CIA was fired, William Colby, replaced by a relatively unknown man 
called George H. W. Bush who then went on to authorize something that Colby had refused to 
authorize - the Team B report - the Team B to recalculate the Soviet threat and it was pre-
determined. They were going to find that it was much bigger than the professionals angled like 
Raymond [inaudible] that I mentioned. 
They said Russia is less of a threat now than it used to be. Well, that was terrible news for the 
industrial complex so the Team B came in and said oh, no, no, no, it's much more of a threat than it 
used to be, and that's why we got this huge military build-up. It started actually under Carter but we 
think of it as the Reagan build-up, and that of course is a major factor in having ended the Soviet 
Union because the Soviet Union tried to match it with a weaker economy. And that arms race which 
was not about threats but was about fighting economic war, that was an arms race which you could 
say that the Soviet Union lost because they couldn't keep it up. Their economy went more and more 
downhill because they were deflecting resources away from vital domestic functions. But really I'm 
trying to talk here about the Halloween Massacre... 
Just the change in the CIA was a major historical event but it wasn't very visible. The second thing 
that happened was they fired Jim Schlesinger as Secretary of Defense... It was being done by 
[President Ford's] Chief of Staff and his assistant who are two names barely known then but quite 
famous since. Chief of staff was Donald Rumsfeld and the assistant was Dick Cheney. And that was 
the first real intrusion of the Rumsfeld-Cheney team into American politics. And they became the real 
heart of what I consider the Deep State in the 1980s when they were planning for Continuity of 
Government which was a plan for emergency rules like warrantless surveillance and warrantless 
detention and the militarization of homeland security. All those things were planned all through the 
'80s - COG planning by Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney. Even when Rumsfeld wasn't in the 
government, he was authorized by Reagan to do this planning. 
And why is that important to our history? Because in 2001, these two men were now in the 
government - Vice President and Secretary of Defense - the two top people in Washington on 
September the 11th, 2001 when Bush was down in Florida - George W. Bush - and what did they do 
on that day? They implemented the plans they had been planning for 20 years. Another major event 
in American history but it's not usually told that way. 
We implemented - it's in the 9/11 Commission Report that COG plans were implemented on that 
day. This is a huge change in our country. We now have an ARMY command, NORTHCOM, to take 
charge of America - North America, the way SOUTHCOM is in charge of South America and 
CENTCOM is in charge of Central Asia. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 017591 
This used to be illegal... We had the posse comitatus acts which said, yes, if there's a real 
emergency you could call up the ARMY to deal with the emergency, but you cannot do it on a 
permanent basis but we now do do it on a permanent basis. We haven't even bothered to repeal the 
posse comitatus. We are in a state of emergency that was declared on September the 14th, 2001. 
And it's still enforced. It has to be renewed every year. Obama did it every year just as George Bush 
renewed it every year. 
What are the roots of this? Well there are the legitimate roots that go back to fear of an atomic 
decapitation of the government back in the Truman era, so legitimate COG planning goes back to 
Truman and Eisenhower, but the illegitimate use of COG to deal with any emergnecy you like, that 
goes to the Reagan administration and it really goes back to the [Halloween] Massacre where 
Rumsfeld and Cheney put their thumbprint on American politics for the first time. 
-- interview of Peter Dale Scott, @ min. 32:00, 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNqDAYWYFuQ&t=2433s 
This all suggests that the start of the 9/11 agenda pre-dated him as well. I see now that there was a 
seemingly relevant 1990 event as well. On September 11, 1970 -- a date that only took on haunting 
overtones with the attacks on New York and Washington in 2001 -- Nixon became the first U.S. 
president to try to protect air travelers from extremists who sensed gaping vulnerabilities in security 
for commercial airliners, issuing a statement listing a string of measures including the introduction of 
100 air marshals on U.S. planes. Most countries, including the United States, found effective means 
of dealing with piracy on the high seas a century and a half ago, Nixon said. We can -- and we will - 
- deal effectively with piracy in the skies today. 
The President had been jolted into action by the simultaneous hijackings of planes in Europe headed 
to the United States. Jets belonging to TWA, Pan Am and Swissair were seized by the Popular Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine. The group also attempted to hijack a jet over London belonging to the 
Israeli airline El Al but was thwarted by security guards on board. 
The Pan Am seizure ended quickly, but the passengers on the TWA and Swissair jets were diverted 
to a British air base in Jordan and the drama only ended after days of tense diplomacy, when the 
hostages were all released in a deal in which the Swiss, German, British and Israeli governments let 
Palestinian prisoners go. (http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/27/politics/terrorism-1970s-richard-
nixon/index.html) 
This 9/11 response sounds quite normal of course. But fast forward and the two secret service 
individuals chosen for an April 2001 interview by a PWC staff member on behalf of what becomthe 
IBM Center for the Business of Government were (1) Steve Colo who happened to be the head of 
the division at SAIC that falsely labeled me a threat and added my name to some sort of Do Not 
Admit list at the end of a 5 month temp assignment in 2005 into early 2006. The consequence of the 
SAIC designation for me was the following: 
(I write) The SAIC designation took advantage of a devilish stratagem in which as a national 
security employee (having filed out a SF-86 form, governed actually by the GSA - 
https://www.osa.clov/portal/forms/download/116390 - for government clearance) working a 
designated contract in a classified facility, being designated a disturbance/dissident/threat to 
operations, makes one, in turn, a threat to national security - with all the surveillance/targeting that 
enables. In essence I was made an enemy of the State and was tracked, my family and friends 
turned, my opportunities seized to include the opportunity to rear family as demonstrated especially 
in the 2007 sabotage of my third trimester pregnancy and then the targeting and eventual capture of 
children I used to babysit - in 2011, they were predominantly tweens - to be used for sexual 
blackmail and other forms of leverage. The reason for the use of children in this barbaric way was to 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 017592 
expend ops that were already in effect and had been used to control many of the politicians that 
have been allowed to rise to the top (see info on the Franklin Scandal for example), and similarly 
according to the laws of compromise, the following which has been recently developing into highly 
coordinated murder ops: 
(I write) The progress that was made from the absorbing of my (small) network (and this through 
sources and methods - money and other pleasureful compensations given to those willing to 
participate in and/or coordinate violence against me and my loved ones to include children leading 
only to now their enabled targeting and the absorbing of whatever may be their networks - well, you 
see below (and this only the very tip of the iceberg) how many people they've been able to engulf 
and what advances have been made by the quite elaborate criminal class employing these tactics; 
and one also begins to better understand the events surrounding Justice Scalia's passing and what's 
to come for the 35 guests in Scalia's private party. As for Scalia's passing, it was decidedly 
suspicious as noted by William Ritchie: (The Washington Post prints) As a former homicide 
commander, I am stunned that no autopsy was ordered for Justice Scalia, William 0. Ritchie, former 
head of criminal investigations for D.C. police, wrote in a post on Facebook on Sunday... Ritchie also 
raised questions about the marshals' actions: How can the Marshal say, without a thorough post 
mortem, that he was not injected with an illegal substance that would simulate a heart attack... Did 
the US Marshal check for petechial hemorrhage in his eyes or under his lips that would have 
suggested suffocation? Did the US Marshal smell his breath for any unusual odor that might suggest 
poisoning? My gut tells me there is something fishy going on in Texas. 
As for SAIC, the following also pertains: 
(I write) If you first see SAIC as what's called a systems integrator (author Tim Shorrock's phrase), 
and also the formerly married Bud and Sue Horton and their two grown sons Matthew Horton and 
Ben Lanier as aids of an implementation, you can better see the bigger picture: 
(1) Sue Horton left IBM in early 2007-ish for an executive position at Tetra Tech which soon entered 
into joint venture with SAIC (Sue's employer prior to IBM, btw) on an enormous (billion dollar) 2011 
Hillary Clinton State Department award (http://www.prnewswire.com/.../saic-tetra-tech-joint-venture-
a...); 
(2) that Bud Horton left IBM in early 2009-ish for an executive position at Accenture which soon 
thereafter entered into joint venture with SAIC spin-off Leidos, and Cerner, on an enormous (billion 
dollar) 2015 DoD award (http://www.healthcareitnews.com/.../dod-names-ehr-contract-wi...); 
(3) that the Sue Horton contract was used to grow and fortify the Afghan heroin trade (as well as 
corrupt law enforcement) although the stated intention was of course the opposite... ([SAIC and 
Tetra Tech's] joint venture, Integrated Justice Systems International, LLC (USD, has been awarded a 
contract to provide worldwide civilian police and criminal justice assistance to the U.S. Department of 
State's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL)... [specifically} to 
provide INL with program management, criminal justice, and life and mission support to countries 
emerging from conflict or otherwise facing instability challenges. Under this new contract, IJSI will 
provide technical assistance, training, logistics and infrastructure services to support the Department 
of State's efforts to strengthen criminal justice systems in select partner countries.)... yet, just 
months shy of contract end, the NY Times reported: Tasked With Combating Opium, Afghan 
Officials Profit From It: Penetrating Every Stage of Afghan Opium Chain, Taliban become a Cartel: 
and Corrupt Combatants Fight for Control of Lucrative Afghan Drug Trade: see also here an 
overview of the growth of Afghan opium production from the start of the US occupation (2001) to the 
present, and especially from contract start (2011) to end (2016): http://www.olobalresearch.ca/the-
spoils-of-war-afohanist.../91; 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 017593 
(4) and that the award Bud Horton helped secure just as Sue's contract was coming to an end was 
not only born from what looks like Franklin Scandal compromises, but it is this contract that seems 
intent on implementing bioterrorism as the new form of explosive terrorism. 
(Note that both members of this family were awarded BILLION dollar contracts; that's quite 
exceptional, no?) 
As for terrorism as an US industry, it's hardly better seen than through the following which is 
information of course we all know: 
We note that in-between Bush #41's 9/11/1990 speech(with Dick Cheney as his Secretary of 
Defense) and the 9/11/2001 attack on the WTC were little more than Clinton's 8 years in the White 
House. We look also to The American Deep State by Peter Dale Scott for evidence of ties between 
the actions of the Clinton administration and (1) the 1993 attack on the WTC and (2) the 1998 attack 
on the US embassy in Nairobi, Kenya which demonstrate that the Clinton administration in no 
uncertain terms sponsored terrorism: 
(Writes Scott) The homicidal crime suggested by Fenton's meticulous research is one both difficult 
and painful to contemplate. It has to be considered in the light of the earlier instances of protection 
we have surveyed: 
1. the protection given to Salameh and Abouhalima in the 1990 Kahane murder, leaving them free to 
participate in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; 
2. the failure for two or three years to process Ali Mohamed's documents seized in 1990, which 
could have prevented the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; 
3. the release of Ali Mohamed from Royal Canadian Mounted Police detention in 1993, leaving him 
free to participate in the 1998 Nairobi Embassy bombing; 
4. the treatment of Ali Mohamed as an unindicted coconspirator in the 1993 WTC bombing case 
and Landmarks case, leaving him free to participate in the 1998 Nairobi Embassy bombing. 
(pp. 76-77, The American Deep State) 
Scott had earlier examined these attacks in especial connection to the September 11, 2001 attack 
on the WTC: 
(Writes Scott) For indeed it is certain that on various occasions U.S. agencies have intervened, 
letting al-Qaeda terrorists proceed with their plots. This alarming statement will be dismissed by 
some as conspiracy theory. Yet in this chapter, I will show that this claim doesn't to arise from 
theory, but from facts that are true, even though they have been systemically suppressed or under-
reported in the American mainstream media. I am describing a phenomenon that occurred not just 
once, but repeatedly, almost predictably. We shall see that, among the al-Qaeda terrorists who were 
first protected and then continued their activities were the following: 
1. Ali Mohamed, identified in the 9/11 Commission Report as the leader of the 1998 Nairobi 
Embassy bombing; 
2. Mohammed Jamal Khalife, Osama bin Laden's close friend and, while in the Philippines, financier 
of both Ramzi Yousef (principal architect of the first World Trade Center [WTC] attack) and his uncle 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 017594 
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed; 
3. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, identified in the 9/11 Commission Report as the principal architect of 
the 9/11 attacks; 
4. Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, two of the alleged 9/11 hijackers, whose presence in the 
United States was concealed from the FBI by CIA officers for months before 9/11. 
It might sound from these citations that the 9/11 Commission marked a new stage in the U.S. 
treatment of these terrorists, and that the report now exposed those terrorists who in the past had 
been protected. On the contrary, a principal purpose of my chapter is to show that 
1. one purpose of protecting these individuals had been to protect a valued intelligence connection 
(the al-Qaeda connection, if you will); 
2. one major intention of the 9/11 Commission Report was to continue protecting this connection; 
3. those on the 9/11 Commission staff who were charged with this protection included at least one 
commission member (Jamie Gorelick), one staff member (Dietrich Snell), and one important witness 
(Patrick Fitzgerald) who earlier had figured among the terrorists' protectors. 
In the course of writing this chapter [Scott continues], I came to another disturbing conclusion I had 
not anticipated. This is that a central feature of the protection has been to defend the 9/11 
Commission's false picture of al-Qaeda as an example of non-state terrorism, ignoring not just the 
CIA but also the royal families of Saudi Arabia and Qatar. In reality, as I shall show, royal family 
protection from Qatar and Saudi Arabia (concealed by the 9/11 Commission) was repeatedly given 
to key figures like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged principal architect of the 9/11 attacks. The 
establishment claims that the wars fought by America in Asia since 9/11 have been part of a global 
war on terror. But this war on terror has been fought in alliance with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and 
Pakistan - precisely the principal political and financial backers of the al-Qaedist networks the United 
States has supposedly been fighting. Meanwhile the most authentic opponents in the region of these 
Sunni al-Qaedists - the governments of Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Iran - have found themselves 
overthrown (in the case of Iraq and Libya), subverted with U.S. support (in the case of Syria), or 
sanctioned and threatened as part of an axis of evil (in the case of Iran). We should not forget that, 
just one day after 9/11, Rumsfeld was talking about broadening the objectives of our response and 
'getting Iraq. 
(pp. 44-45, The American Deep State) 
Clinton's daughter is now poised to work global health initiatives which I would suggest is little more 
than a cover for on-going terrorism ops. 
To return to Steve Colo - in the interview he speaks of a partnership between the Secret Service, the 
FBI, and South Carolina's SLED (State Law Enforcement Division) to open a Computer Crime 
Center. Bud Horton (mentioned above) (long-affiliated with IT Security; his title at Accenture was 
Chief technology officer of it's cyber security practice) happened to have just moved to South 
Carolina from Loudoun County after being implicated in a continuing child sex scandal (see details 
below). Further, cyber-crime just so happens to be another of the arenas in which our Intelligence 
Community coordinates with the Russians: The US cooperates with the FSB and Russia's interior 
ministry on counter-terrorism, organized crime, bio-terrorism, and cyber-crime. -- p. 243, Expelled: A 
Journalist's Descent into the Russian Mafia State, by Luke Harding) Most would interpret this quote 
to suggest that the nations work together to prevent these various threats. The reality is more the 
opposite; trust me when I say that the US doesn't work ops alone - the 2005 London Bombings is 
one notable example of a instance in which the US coordinated with also British intelligence in the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 017595 
perpetration of an attack.) I just tweeted this morning actually the following in regards to US 
coordinations with the Russians: One must know a renowned Rus mafiaso was granted entry

As you may know, she was once close with an individual named Matthew Horton with whom she 
attended George Mason University, and through Matthew, Ms. Simms became well-acquainted with 
Matthew's parents Henry Bud Horton and Sue Popovich Horton who helped secure her a position 
at IBM upon her graduation from GMU. Both of these latter individuals (Bud and Sue Horton) were 
involved in the 2007 murder of my son, and they in collusion with their son Matthew continue in the 
exploitation of children Anjulee and Xian Gunther. The powers that be intend now for these children 
to (continue to) follow in the footsteps of Ms. Simms, and to that end, I would advise that you 
become acquainted with (1) the ways in which Ms. Simms subsidized her law school education and 
off course (2) her current and related endeavors especially as they relate to drug trafficking and 
terror financing (see below email to Mr. Martin of the St. Augustine Record). 
On Friday, June 23, 2017 8:36 AM, 
Mr. Martin, 
St. Augustine Record 
wrote: 
Quite an interesting article about the litigation between Deputy Banks and Rusty Rogers (see: 
Deputy Banks' attorney claims FDLE agent's credibility 'destroyed') It must also be explored, of 
course, that Officers Rodgers was once well respected for his investigation and exposure of a 
terrorist financing network that permeated the sunny state of Florida - (the NY Times reports) Agent 
Rodgers joined the state's elite investigative unit, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, where 
he quickly earned agent-of-the-year honors — and a meeting with the governor — for helping 
dismantle a terrorist financing network that stretched from Florida to the Middle East - and that 
terrorism is very much a well-protected U.S. industry (see below). 
God forbid some poor should get away with disrupting the delicate state of secreted operations; as 
you yourself report, As written in [Plaintiff Banks] motion: Defendant Rodgers' false, misleading 
and inconsistent testimony throughout the discovery process is so pervasive and extreme, and 
involves so many material issues, it has destroyed Defendant's credibility on all issues... And here 
we see the whole-of-government attempts to restore balance. 
As for the second Secret Service agent interviewed by the IBM Center for the Business of 
Government, his name is Dana Brown. He just so happened to have filled out his career with the 
Federal Air Marshall Service (October 2003-August 2008 as Director/Chief of Staff) followed by the 
TSA (March 2006-January 2009 as Asst. Administrator-Law Enforcement/Integrity Officer) states his 
Linked In profile. That he worked his way around to that which was largely put in place by the 1970 
9/11 mini-event seems to me rather significant although I don't see all the details yet. I also don't yet 
see exactly who it was that birthed this lengthy 9/11 initiative we're suffering. It seems clear, 
however, that it was birthed prior to 1970. 
The initiative has adjusted in some ways over time, but homage to 9/11 remains strong. Certain of 
the people deeply involved in these manipulations thought it was kismet that an individual well-suited 
to head the newly ordained Department of Homeland Security (that as we all know was the result of 
legislation rushed through Congress in the aftermath of the 9/11 (2001) attack) was born on the 
magical September 11th (this is Jeh Johnson); similarly, it is again being deemed a sign that the new 
Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) (chosen and positioned as she was) is first-
named France (last name Cordova) and that this name so perfectly relates to US intentions to use 
the NSF to forward ops that will solidify a US-France working relationship in the same way the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 017597 
2005 London Bombings helped solidify the US-British working relationship. These France going-ons 
are in higher gear (I've noticed) since Macron was elected but it was prepped for long ago. I was 
working for IBM under IBM project manager Cathie Skoog at the NSF when my third trimester 
pregnancy was sabotaged. The story of this sabotage and what followed is (briefly) this: 
I've long-alleged that John and Avery Gunther (whose children I used to babysit) agreed to a quid 
pro quo exchange of financial compensation for help destroying my credibility on behalf of IBM 
against whom I'd filed a 2010 EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) charge and a 
subsequent May 2011 civil suit. 
Per the May 11, 2011 Complaint, McGuire v. John and Avery Gunther: 
3. On April 6, 2011 Mr. and Mrs Gunther, with uncontrolled greed and total disregard for the rights 
and feelings of Ms. Nadine McGuire as well as those of their children, AFG and XWG, maliciously 
and with ill-intent, wrongfully completed and executed a Complaint and Motion for Preliminary 
Injunction requesting formal protection against Ms. Nadine McGuire. 
4. Over the course of the previous few months, Mr. and Mrs. Gunther, colluding with persons against 
whom Ms. Nadine McGuire is currently furthering litigation, including but not limited to plaintiff's 
mother, Pauline Scala McGuire, and from whom they received and/or have been promised to receive 
monetary incentives, hid their relationships with said individuals, further lied about having those 
relationships in direct conversation with Ms. Nadine McGuire and Court testimony on May 4, 2011, 
and wrongfully completed and executed a Complaint and Motion for Preliminary Injunction against 
Ms. Nadine McGuire in cooperation and collaboration with said persons, resulting in the issuance of 
a Temporary Restraining Order against Ms. Nadine McGuire issued on April 6, 2011. 
- Initial Complaint, 5/11/11, McGuire v. John and Avery Gunther, Case No.:2011 CA 003703 B, DC 
Superior Court, Judge Gregory Jackson presiding 
In regards to the suit against IBM (McGuire v. IBM, 1:11CV528, US District Court of Virginia), the 
only suit in which Pauline Scala McGuire was listed as a defendant, the most important claim was 
one of assault that led to the 2007 death of my son. Per the filing: 
Plaintiff, Grace Nadine McGuire, realleges the allegations of paragraphs 1-65 hereof as if fully set 
forth within and further alleges: 
66. Defendant Palmisano's conduct in ascertaining the drug that was used on the plaintiff to end her 
pregnancy and take the life of her child on April 22, 2007, constitutes an intentional touching of the 
plaintiff by defendant Palmisano, and was undertaken deliberately and with actual malice towards 
the plaintiff and her unborn child. 
67. Defendant Skoog, Susan Horton and Scala's conduct in coordinating the circumstances, creating 
physical proximity and the administering of the drug to the plaintiff that ended her pregnancy and 
took the life of her child on April 22, 2007 constituted an intentional touching of the plaintiff by said 
defendants, and was undertaken deliberately and with actual malice towards the plaintiff and her 
unborn child. 
... 69. As the direct and proximate result of defendant Palmisano, Skoog, Susan Horton, and Scala's 
conduct, the plaintiff suffered a severe placental abruption, which terminated her pregnancy and 
ended the life of her unborn child, causing the plaintiff to suffer damages including but not limited to 
the loss of her child, loss of affection, grief, sorrow, extreme mental torment and emotional distress.

- Initial Complaint, filed 5/16/11, McGuire v. IBM, et al, Case No.: 1:11CV528, US District Court of 
Virginia - Eastern Division, Alexandria, Judge Leonie Brinkema presiding 
This is to say that John and Avery Gunther helped IBM defend against an allegation of murder, and 
in this way they are accomplices to a cover-up. This is also to say that the characterization provided 
by John and Avery Gunther in their April 2011 Superior Court filing for a Protection Order against me 
and their admissions in this filing of having provided derogatory information to various persons 
and/or entities in the DC area to include school administrators, psychologists, and law enforcement, 
were more to harm me, especially in my chances to hold IBM accountable, than to protect either 
themselves or children Anjulee and Xian Gunther. 
I also long-allege that the relationship that developed from this initial quid pro quo led to John and 
Avery Gunther being similarly compensated for what turned into the sexual exploitation of their two 
daughters. For more on child sexual exploitation for the sake of personal and professional leverage, 
see especially the following: 
Nick Bryant I The Franklin Scandal & The Elite's Pedophilia Cover Up, 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68gyGGPjmOo&t=978s  
That the NSF won't acknowledge the abuse, and won't respond even to my FOIA requests, and 
otherwise has gone to extents to protect Cathie Skoog and her co-conspirators at IBM and otherwise 
is all that was needed to have adequately turned the organization towards the interests of the Deep 
State. Now it is simply a matter of the Deep State continuing to put the NSF to use.

Jeffrey Epstein in context: 
(As sent to the Wash Post) 
I send you this in response to the recent column entitled Believe in the Process by Kenneth Starr. 
Perhaps rethink any public affiliation with Ken Starr; although his demeanor on paper is undoubtably 
consoling, it is also a bit intoxifying when it would be best now if we keep our wits about us, no? 
I say this from the following perspective - Ken Starr of the Starr Report, attorney for (1) Erik Prince of 
Blackwater and (2) convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein in context: 
The Starr Report buried behind salacious detail of the Lewinsky affair almost nothing of Whitewater, 
Travelgate, or otherwise what many consider the murder of Vince Foster (Foster, albeit the subject 
of a different investigation was also under the purview of attorney Starr and formal investigation of 
the results of Starr's investigation were drowned out by the details of the Lewinsky affair.) This is a 
bit strange considering the Lewinsky affair was a moral failing and not an actionable criminal one as 
would have been the others had any proof surfaced. 
Starr later defended Blackwater against wrongful deaths suit initiated by the families of the 2004 
Fallujah Ambush victims - In October 2006, Blackwater hired one of the nation's heaviest-hitting 
lawyers to represent it - Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel in the 1999 impeachment of 
President Bill Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal... Starr and his colleagues argued that 
Blackwater was constitutionally immune from such lawsuits and said that if the Fallujah case were 
allowed to proceed, Blackwater will suffer irreparable harm. In the eighteen-page petition to the 
Supreme Court, Blackwater argued that there are no other such lawsuits against private 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 017599 
military/security companies in state courts because the comprehensive regulatory scheme enacted 
by Congress and the President grant military contractors like Blackwater immunity from state-court 
litigation. (pp. 234-235, Blackwater). (Author Ken Davis writes) The four men had spent the night 
before they set off at marine base Camp Fallujah. But the men kept their distance from the 
leathernecks. Had they spoken to the marines, the Blackwater team might have learned that the 
Americans were already in the midst of a major offensive meant to assert control over the 
increasingly restive city, where elements of the radical Islamist movement and remnants of 
Saddam's army were beginning to aggressively strike back. at the American occupation (p. 306, 
The Hidden History of American at War), and perhaps this is the only thing that makes sense of the 
fact that Under the terms of its contract, Blackwater was supposed to supply these convoy security 
missions with two SUVs, each carrying three guards per vehicle; a driver, one man riding shotgun, 
and a third man in back with a heavy machine gun. Instead, the foursome set out that morning with 
just two men per car, each vehicle missing their rear gunner. The SUVs were only outfitted with a 
steel plate as extra armor. And the men had not been given maps. (p. 305). 
Starr went on to defend Jeffrey Epstein abasing allegations of child sex trafficking - Along with a 
dream team of attorneys that included Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black, and Ken Starr, [Alan Dershowitz] 
was successful in getting federal investigators not to charge Epstein with moving his victims across 
state lines and other associated crimes. The federal non-prosecution agreement Epstein's legal 
team negotiated with the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida immunized all named and 
unnamed potential co-conspirators in Epstein's child trafficking network, which includes those who 
allegedly procured minors for Epstein and also any powerbrokers who may have molested them (-
http://dawker.com/flioht-loos-put-clinton-dershowitz-on-ped...). Otherwise, Epstein's eventual 18 
month sentence by the state of Florida was exceptionally light under the circumstances to include 
the number of victims who came forward with testimony. This is best understood in the context of 
children being used as a means to government-sponsored sexual blackmail and other forms of 
leverage. 
See here Erik Prince in greater context: (the similarities between him and once (secretly) favored 
child Bin Laden) 
The coordinations among global intelligence to make rather than eliminate terror as seen thru 
assets bin Laden (as M. Noriega before him) & Erik Prince: 
About BL: Some CIA officers will later say that [BL] serves as a semi-official liaison between the GIP 
[Saudi intell and warlords like Sayyaf. 
(www.historycommons.ord/entity.isp?entity=ahmed badeeb 1) 
About EP: Handcuffed by politics, the CIA had not been able to cultivate relationships with the key 
but messy leaders. Fortunately, Blackwater had no such political restrictions. (p. 54, Civilian 
Warriors by E. Prince) 
We see also: 
About BL: Bin Laden established camps inside Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan and trained 
volunteers from across the Muslim world to fight against the Soviet-backed regime, the Democratic 
Republic of Afghanistan (Wikipedia) 
About EP: In his autobiography, he states that during the Yugoslav Wars in the early 1990s, he 
realized the need for private training facilities for special operations... Prince moved to Virginia 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 017600 
Beach and personally financed the formation of Blackwater Worldwide in 1997. He bought 6,000 
acres (24 km2) of the Great Dismal Swamp of North Carolina and set up a school for special 
operations (Wikipedia) 
Erik Prince is (becoming) no less an Amer. intelligence success story than bin Laden (in support of 
Terrorism as Geostrategy & a New World Order - see below). In short: (we note the repeating 9/11s, 
every 11 years): Toward a NWO speech by Bush #41 - Sept. 11 ('90); The WTC - Sept. 11 ('01); 
Benghazi - Sept. 11 ('12). (There is rhy. & reason also 2 the rise of ISIS.) 
*** 
About training camps: 
I watched so to speak the creating of little torture pockets around the world as justified by Obama's 
desire to close Gitmo. The White House reports (2/23/16): We'll continue to securely and 
responsibly transfer to other countries the 35 detainees already approved for transfer. This process 
involves extensive and careful coordination across our federal government to ensure that our 
national security interests are met when an individual is transferred to another country. We insist, for 
example, that foreign countries institute strong security measures. But are these not just the seeds 
of new training camps (growing concentrated and lauded violent temperaments) & was that not 
someone's exact intent? 
In real-time (and as perpetrated on captured children): 
3/19/14, sent to the now defunct FB page of D. Cheney: 
Dick Cheney, 
I wonder if it's possible that there is coordination with other countries concerning enhanced 
interrogation techniques, in the form of training perhaps? 
Specifically, here in the United States, my sense is that there may be the use of vulnerable 
populations, with the intension to gain favor with and/or intimidate others, especially members of the 
international community.

any investigations. ... Law enforcement officers and prosecutors may never select the timing of
investigative steps or criminal charges for the purpose of affecting any election, or for the purpose of

giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party.”

Strong evidence of a crime can overcome this policy, as was the case with the bureau’s investigation of
Mrs. Clinton’s private email server, which began more than a year before the 2016 election. But
Crossfire was not a criminal investigation. It was a counterintelligence investigation predicated on the
notion that Russia could be colluding with the Trump campaign. There appears to have been no
discernible evidence of Trump-Russia collusion at the time Crossfire was launched, further reinforcing

the notion that it was initiated “for the purpose” of affecting the presidential election.

The chief evidence of collusion is the hacking of the Democratic National Committee’s servers. But
nothing in the public record suggests the Trump campaign aided that effort. The collusion narrative
therefore hinges on the more generic assertion that Russia aimed to help Mr. Trump’s election, and that
the Trump campaign reciprocated by embracing pro-Russian policies. Yet despite massive surveillance
and investigation, there’s still no public evidence of any such exchange—only that Russia attempted to

sow political discord by undermining Mrs. Clinton and to a lesser extent Mr. Trump.

Some members of the Trump team interacted with Russians and advocated dovish policies. But so did
numerous American political and academic elites, including many Clinton advisers. Presidential
campaigns routinely seek opposition research and interact with foreign powers. The Clinton campaign
funded the Steele dossier, whose British author paid Russians to dish anti-Trump dirt. The Podesta
Group, led by the brother of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, received millions lobbying for
Russia’s largest bank and the European Center for a Modern Ukraine, both with deep Kremlin ties. The

Clinton Foundation and Bill Clinton took millions from Kremlin-connected businesses.

No evidence has emerged of Trump-Russia collusion, and Mr. Mueller has yet to bring collusion-
related charges against anyone. Evidence suggests one of his targets, George Papadopoulos, was lured
to London, plied with the prospect of Russian information damaging to Mrs. Clinton, and taken to
dinner, where he drunkenly bragged that he’d heard about such dirt but never seen it. These
circumstances not only fail to suggest Mr. Papadopoulos committed a crime, they reek of entrapment.
The source of this information, former Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, admits Mr.
Papadopolous never mentioned emails, destroying any reasonable inference of a connection between

the DNC hack and the Trump campaign.

underage females and we would like to ask you about your
observations,” put the recipient on notice that you,
yourself, are accused of criminal conduct in abusing
minors?

potential, obviously, witness to this and then therefore
you could have potential involvement.

he declared that this agent would be “welcome, provided, however,
that he stops any kind of activity that could damage Russian-US
relations.”

Even before that public confirmation of the Russian role in Hong
Kong, the White House was well aware of it. On June 23, the Demo-
cratic senator Charles Schumer of New York correctly said, based
on a White House briefing, that “Vladimir Putin had personally
approved Snowden’s flight” to Moscow. The NSA had the means to
monitor Russian communication between Moscow and Hong Kong.
The NSA also reportedly intercepted contacts between these Russian
officials and Russian representatives of Aeroflot, the Russian state-
owned airline that had flights between Hong Kong and Moscow.
Aeroflot (like most other international carriers) ordinarily requires
international passengers to have both a valid passport and, if neces-
sary, a visa to the country of their destination. Those rules had to
be waived for Snowden’s exfiltration from Hong Kong. Snowden’s
defection to Moscow was not a haphazard result of unexpected cir-
cumstances. Russia obviously knew he was coming. This raised new

© questions for the investigation. What led Snowden to defect to Rus- ®
sia? Was his arrival in Moscow planned by Russian intelligence in
advance of his going public in Hong Kong? Was any other party,
such as China, privy to the plan? Was there a quid pro quo?

Putin’s authorization could certainly account for Aeroflot’s waiv-
ing its usual passport and visa check to allow Snowden to board its
plane, as well as the dispatch with which Russian officials whisked
Snowden off the plane after it landed at the Moscow airport. It could
also account for Snowden’s vanishing from public view for the next
three weeks and the promulgation of the cover story that Snowden
was unwillingly trapped at the airport by the U.S. government. The
reasons behind Putin’s move were less clear.

By September 2013, the investigation was looking into a veri-
table abyss. Snowden’s culpability was no longer an issue. What was
lacking from Snowden’s video, or the two-hour film made by Laura
Poitras, was any specific information on how many documents he
had copied, how he had obtained the passwords to the computers
on which they were stored, the period of time involved in the theft,
or how he had breached all the security measures of the NSA in

The rape suit isn’t exactly new. It was filed pro se by “Katie Johnson” in Los Angeles federal court in
April, dismissed, refiled in the Southern District of New York, withdrawn and refiled on Sept. 30. But
with the addition of Mason—a media-savvy lawyer not known for shying away from the
spotlight—the stakes have changed.

Suddenly, it’s a lot more serious. Which is not the same as legitimate, but
the odds that the case will go away quietly are much slimmer given the
rN firepower of her new counsel. Especially now, in the wake of a 2005

= =| recording where Trump bragged about using his star power to kiss and
; grope women.

DAILY DICTA

The allegations in the suit are truly awful. Jane Doe says that when she was
13, she attended parties at Epstein’s New York City townhouse, enticed by
promises of money and a modeling career. She allegedly had sexual
encounters with Trump on four occasions there.

The complaint states, “Defendant Trump tied plaintiff to a bed, exposed
himself to plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape plaintiff. During the
course of this savage sexual attack, plaintiff loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to stop but with no
effect. Defendant Trump responded to plaintiff's pleas by violently striking plaintiff in the face with
his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted.”

Epstein allegedly raped her as well. In 2008, he pleaded guilty to soliciting an underage girl for
prostitution, and has faced other suits by women who allege underage sexual assault.

Trump’s lawyer Alan Garten, has unequivocally denied the allegations. In fact, the current complaint
quotes his denial: “The allegations are not only categorically false, but disgusting at the highest level
and clearly framed to solicit media attention or, perhaps, are simply politically motivated. There is
absolutely no merit to these allegations. Period.” Doe’s suit claims that this statement is libelous.

The only reason I can think of for including such a seemingly absurd claim (how can you libel
someone who is anonymous?) is that it’s not time-barred. The rest of the complaint probably is.

The alleged incidents took place in 1994—22 years ago. The complaint claims that Doe didn’t come
forward because she was “unrelentingly threatened by each defendant that, were she ever to reveal
any of the details of the sexual and physical abuse caused to her by defendants, plaintiff and her
family would be physically harmed if not killed.”

But Epstein in 2008 was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Why couldn’t she have come forward
then?

That’s not the only problem with the case.

I wrote about the suit when it was first filed in LA with great skepticism—“an anonymous stink
bomb,” I called it.

In large part, I was dubious because the person filing the complaint, “Katie Johnson,” claimed her
only past work experience was as a freelance model. And yet her pro se complaint was perfectly
formatted, with proper margins and numbering; it correctly cited statutes, got the venue and
jurisdiction correct and contained no typos.

could derail the last innings of this recovery and
bull market. The first three are low-probability
risks in our view, the next three risks have a

high probability of occurring but their impact is
uncertain and the last two are high-probability and
high-impact risks beginning as early as 2017.

Low-Probability but High-Impact Risks:

is disruptive and financial markets
react negatively.
The economy slips into recession.
Populist parties in the Eurozone

High-Probability but Uncertain-Impact Risks:

High-Probability and High-Impact Risks:

Pace of Federal Reserve Tightening

Unlike the December 2015 interest rate hike that
prompted a vocal response from naysayers but had
limited impact on the bond market, the December
2016 hike has elicited a muted response from
market commentators but has had a larger impact
on the bond market. The underlying strength of the
labor market and the steady improvement in the
economy have led to a change of sentiment toward
more interest rate hikes, which are clearly in the

offing. Interest rates have increased from
a low of 1.3% for the 10-year Treasury
in July 2016 to 2.4% by year-end. While
this increase in interest rates would
ordinarily tighten financial conditions,

it has been partially offset by stronger
equity markets and tighter corporate
bond spreads. In fact, financial conditions
were looser at the end of the year than
they were at the beginning of 2016
despite expectations of a slow but steady
increase in the federal funds rate.

We share the market view that the
pace of monetary policy tightening will
accelerate but remain benign. As shown
in Exhibit 23, the difference between
the Federal Reserve dots, the view implied by the
bond market, the forecast by our colleagues in
GIR and our view is negligible. The bond market
has priced two hikes, the Federal Reserve and GIR
expect three hikes, and we think two or three hikes
are equally likely in 2017. We assume that the
Federal Reserve will slow down the pace of interest

There is no shortage of concerns as markets climb a wall of worry.

talks. I did realize that, “null and void” or not, our proposals or suggestions would
not simply disappear from memory. But I felt the point of principle was essential if
Israel was going to be able to consider the kind of far-reaching concessions which
final peace deals might require.

In the end, I realized that we might simply discover that Assad, and certainly
Arafat, were not willing or ready to make peace. We might, initially at least, have
to settle for a more incremental step. “Right here in Camp David, Begin, Sadat and
Carter couldn’t complete the process,” I pointed out. “They signed a “framework
agreement’ and it took months of further diplomacy to reach a peace treaty. Maybe
we ll end up doing the same.” But I told the President I was convinced that if we
didn’t try to get agreements, we’d have no way of knowing whether the will to
make peace was there on the other side. Assad, I suspected, was the more likely to
reciprocate. That was a major reason I wanted to start our efforts with him. But so
far, his true intentions had never been fested, beyond his obvious determination to
get back the Golan. Nor had Arafat’s, beyond his focus on the detail and extent of
West Bank redeployments.

President Clinton did not object to an early effort to reopen our efforts with the
Syrians. But he was worried about the effects of ignoring the already-creaking
prospects of fulfilling the promise of Oslo. If we were going to delay focusing on
that, Clinton told me, he needed to be able to assure Arafat the wait would be
worth his while. What could we give the PLO leader in return for putting off the
Wye redeployments further, he asked. And then, the real question on his mind:
“Ehud, when we get to the final redeployment and a peace deal, how much of the
West Bank are you prepared to hand back?”

I simply didn’t know at this stage. Much would depend on whether we could be
sure Arafat could or would deliver a final peace. But even if I had known, I would
have been reluctant to name a precise percentage. Though I had full trust in
President Clinton, I knew that everything he and I said would be shared with at
least a few of his closest policy aides and negotiators. Sooner or later, word would
get to Arafat. When we did begin negotiations, he’d take whatever number I gave
as a mere starting point. Still, I knew I had to signal the President that I was serious
about negotiating with Arafat when the time came. I also knew the main source of
his concern. In order to get the agreement at Wye, the President had signed on to a
provision that the dimension of the third and final redeployment phase would be
determined by Israel alone. By that stage, when we got there, Arafat would have

How Obama Blew the Chance for Economic Peace
by Mitchell Bard

Iln 2009, Barack Obama had an
unprecedented opportunity to advance the
peace process between Israel and the
Palestinians. For the first time, the
Palestinians had a prime minister who was
respected and admired by the Israelis,
because he did not come from the same
terrorist background as Yasser Arafat and
Mahmoud Abbas. Unlike his ideological -
comrades who insisted on “liberating Palestine,” Salam Fayyad, was
interested in building the infrastructure for a future state,
strengthening the West Bank economy, and improving the lives of the
Palestinian people.

government has been bullied into making some statement of the kind to silence those who will pressure them
that they are “Islamophobic” and Islam is being attacked. (These are the Islam hustlers who operate on the
same principles that black race hustlers so effectively used to extort concessions over the last six decades or
SO).

Nobody has done any real work to support this proposition, nor is it clear exactly how it would be tested. My
view is that the grammar “Islam is x” is itself problematic because Islam has expressed itself throughout
history in a variety of fashions. It is more useful to talk in terms of how seriously engaged with Islam, the
Koran and other texts, a Muslim is. What is significant is how Muslims today are using Islam and most of
those who are in power either throughout a large territory or within a small community tend toward, if not
fully advocate, the very supremacist ideas that we try to tell ourselves are reserved for the

few ”extremists.” Presumably most Germans did not wish to see all Nazi atrocities carried out but in the end
they fell in line because they had to. Those our politicians and press call the “extremists” are in one sense
more accurately the “good” Muslims who ar e following their Islamic beliefs dutifully.

FP: Tell us how Western shame and guilt play into all of this.

Siegel: One of the dirty little secrets the Control Factor preys upon is that if we believe we control something
we can comfort ourselves that we can change it. Remember the horror film- the threat has one purpose and
that is to destroy you. You can not change it, talk it out of it, teach it alternatives or otherwise. That is what
makes it so inherently frightening. If we can convince ourselves that we caused the threat to act the way it
does we can maintain the secret hope that we can change it. Consequently, there is a tremendous attraction to
blaming ourselves for the Islamic Enemy’s behavior. And we see this power in our readily accepting
responsibility for terror- because of our occupation, our greedy quest for oil, our failure to extend a hand of
“engagement,” Israel’s building settlements, our making videos that defa me Mohammed and so on. Again,
the relationship is defined by the enemy blaming us for his actions and our accepting such responsibility.

Shelby Steele has written brilliantly about what he calls “white guilt” and outlines how whites during the
60's and thereafter were pressured into a transaction whereby in order to re-obtain a sense of moral authority
they accepted blame for the condition of blacks and behaved as if guilty. Blacks were able to extract great
concessions and whites were able to view themselves as morally restored and redeemed. At a certain point,
however, the behavior takes on a life of its own and the narratives become deeply embedded in the culture
and, as we can see today, difficult to uproot.

Western guilt is an extension of Steele’s notion. President Obama’s confessionals to the Arab world
admitting that America has made “‘mistakes” and was not born a colonial pow er express this same tendency
to appease through guilt. Hillary Clint on’s “reset” with Russia conveyed the same submissive request for a
more acceptable response. In being guilty we presume the other party will recognize our contrition and
respond in like kind. One of the Control Factor’s most devastating moves is employed- presuming the other
is just like us and will respond the way we would. This is frequently how an enabler justifies his continuous
support for an addict. The problem, however is that our Islamic Enemy is NOT like us and will not respond
in like kind. Rather, as we repeatedly refuse to learn, appeasement invites more abuse from an

enemy. This becomes the ’game of guilt;” it tends to expand to greater and greater consequences.
Paradoxically, psychological defenses tend to create the very outcomes they seek to eliminate and it is no
different here. It is a game we love to play but, unfortunately, the game gives us no rules for how to end it.

All beha vior is instructive. That is, we teach others how to treat us. The game of guilt, along with other
Control Factor tools, teaches our Enemy it is winning and to continue playing.

FP: The reason Nidal Hasan was able to perpetrate his murder spree at Fort Hood is precisely because of our
Control Factor. Please connect the dots for our readers.

Siegel: Just as I used to look at Hitler when I was young and be amazed that no one could see what he was
about, in retrospect the same applies to Hasan. It is precisely all the elements of the Control Factor that could
allow this man, a Soldier of Allah, to be positioned as he was. He was blatantly voicing his Islamist views
and Jihadi intent including, even, an essay recommending the “painful liquidation” of non-Muslims. Yet, in

Now that two of the culprits were dead, public outrage was focused on those who were still alive.
The media presented the recurrent vision of the murdered toddler and expressed the view that “if
they hadn’t gotten Gary Tison and Greenawalt out, none of this would have happened.” The
press demanded the gas chamber. One editorial expressed chagrin that anyone had been captured
alive.

The two surviving brothers were tried and convicted of the murders, based on the account they
had given the authorities. Under the laws of felony murder and conspiracy, they were as guilty of
murdering the Lyons’ family as were the men who pulled the triggers. The judge employed the
same legal fictions in sentencing them both to die in Arizona’s gas chamber. My job was to try to
save their lives, since the evidence of their guilt—under the long established felony murder and
conspiracy theories—could not reasonably be contested.

After several unsuccessful appeals in the Arizona state courts, we decided to seek review in the
Supreme Court. This decision was itself controversial within the anti-capital punishment legal
community. The legal landscape had changed since the Supreme Court decided Furman and
several other cases imposing restrictions on the use of the death penalty. In 1982, the justices had
decided the case of Enmund v. Florida, reversing the death penalty of a defendant who drove the
“getaway car in an armed robbery of a home in which Enmund’s accomplices killed the elderly
couple they had robbed. The vote was 5 to 4. The majority reasoned that:

“We are quite unconvinced, however, that the threat that the death penalty will be
imposed for murder will measurably deter one who does not kill and has no intention or
purpose that life will be taken. Instead, it seems likely that capital punishment can serve
as a deterrent only when murder is the result of premeditation and deliberation, for if a
person does not intend that life be taken or contemplate that lethal force will be employed
by others, the possibility that the death penalty will be imposed for vicarious felony murder
will not enter into the cold calculus that precedes the decision to act.

It then went on to say that:

“Tt would be very different if the likelihood of a killing in the course of a robbery were so
substantial that one should share the blame for the killing if he somehow participated in
the felony. But competent observers have concluded that there is no basis in experience
for the notion that death so frequently occurs in the course of a felony for which killing is
not an essential ingredient that the death penalty should be considered as a justifiable
deterrent to the felony itself.”

The Enmund decision seemed to apply to the facts of the Tison case. The problem was that there
had been an important change of personnel in the High Court between the time Enmund was
decided and the filing of our petition for review. Justice Antonin Scalia had joined the court and
soon became its most outspoken critic of the campaign to abolish the death penalty. William
Rehnquist, also a strong supporter of capital punishment and an Arizona resident who was aware
of the Tison rampage was now the court’s Chief Justice. Finally, Justice Byron White, who had
written the majority opinion in Enmund, seemed to be backtracking a bit in subsequent cases.

Israel should be wary of celebrating the

‘Shia crescent' setback
Jonathan Spyer

7 September 2011 -- Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's backing of the Syrian
regime during the recent upheaval has damaged his standing in the
Middle East. Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA

In recent years, Israeli strategists have identified an Iran-led regional
alliance as representing the main strategic challenge to the Jewish
state. This alliance looks to be emerging as one of the net losers of
the Arab upheavals of 2011. This, however, should be cause for
neither satisfaction nor complacency for Israel. The forces moving in
to replace or compete with Iran and its allies are largely no less
hostile. The Iran-led regional alliance, sometimes called the
muqawama (resistance) bloc, consisted of a coalition of states and
movements led by Tehran and committed to altering the US-led
dispensation that pertained since the end of the cold war.

It included, in addition to Iran itself, the Hezbollah movement in
Lebanon, the Sadrist movement and other Shia Islamist currents in
Iraq, Syria's Assad regime, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad
organisation. It appeared in recent years also to be absorbing Hamas.
The mugawama bloc presented itself as the representative of
authentic Islamic currents in the Middle East, and as locked in
combat until the end with the west and its clients. These included
Saudi Arabia, Hosni Mubarak's Egypt, and above all, Israel.
However, the alliance always had a rather obvious flaw: while
presenting itself as an inclusive, representative camp, it was an almost
exclusively Shia Muslim club, in a largely Sunni Muslim Middle

that he and others were convinced Bibi couldn’t win. A couple of weeks later,
Yitzhik Mordechai seemed on the verge of becoming the latest of Bibi’s ministers
to resign. He was openly flirting with the idea of joining a new centrist party that
had been formed by Likud’s Dan Meridor. Bibi struck back with a mixture of
subtlety and venom. He fired Mordechai, accusing him of being driven by personal
ambition. Then he offered the Defense Minister’s job to Misha Arens.

Yitzhik did join the Center Party, as did Amnon Lipkin, who had ended his
term as chief-of-staff and, with initial opinion poll numbers suggesting he’d do
well, even briefly entered the race for Prime Minister. Now, he endorsed Yitzhik
Mordechai instead: a man not only with strong military credentials, but of Sephardi
background and religiously observant, and a proven politician and cabinet minister.
It was clear that he would be going after many of the same votes I needed to win.

That situation wasn’t ideal, to put it mildly. But all I could do at this stage was
to put our own campaign house in order. I hoped that if we ran the campaign I
expected, there wouldn’t be a run-off.

At the start of April, the final list of candidates was set. There were five. In
addition to Bibi, Yitzhik and me, Benny Begin had decided to run on the right.
Also in the contest was Knesset member Azmi Beshara, the first Israeli Arab
citizen to seek national office.

When we chose “One Israel” as the name of our campaign alliance, it was not
meant just as a catchy phrase. Though now a half-century old, the country had
rarely seemed so diverse, and in many ways divided. It was not just the old fault
line between Labor and Revisionist Zionism that defined our politics, or even the
Ashkenazi-Sephardi gulf that had predominated since the late 1970s. There were
new, younger, more assertive, more right-wing and more pro-settlement voices
among the Orthodox. There was the contrast between the overwhelmingly secular,
politically and socially liberal, and culturally Western Tel Aviv, with its lively
cafés and restaurants, and the constellation of wealthy suburbs to the north; and
smaller Israeli towns and cities in the interior, Jerusalem as well, not to mention

CLA., 355 F.3d 675, 678 (D.C. 2004) (court explaining that “the agency’s failure to turn up a
particular document, or mere speculation that as yet uncovered documents might exist, does not
undermine the determination that the agency conducted an adequate search for the requested
records.”). Moreover, when dealing with a former President’s security detail travel, there are a
number of reasons why the government may not disclose those records.

As explained above, public flight records from Jeffrey Epstein’s private plane show that
President Clinton traveled with Jeffrey Epstein on multiple occasions. Nevertheless, if Defendant
Dershowitz wants to pursue this issue before the Court, then he needs to produce for deposition
testimony in this case and the proposed criminal investigation, the other witnesses that were
present on the island at the time former President Clinton was alleged to have visited, including
his client Jeffrey Epstein, and Ghislaine Maxwell, to whom he has testified he is party to a joint
defense agreement. It is worth noting on that point, that despite Mr. Epstein’s counsel’s
attendance at depositions in this case, and Defendant Dershowitz’s claim that Mr. Epstein is still
his client, Mr. Epstein has taken extreme measures to avoid being deposed in this case despite
being ordered to deposition by this Court.

Indeed, it is also noteworthy that during Defendant Dershowitz’s recent deposition,
counsel for Mr. Edwards and Mr. Cassell asked Defendant Dershowitz the following question:
“Was Virginia Roberts lying when she said Jeffrey Epstein socialized with Bill Clinton during the
relevant time period?” Depo Tr. Of Alan Dershowitz, Vol. 4, January 12, 2016 at 511. Before
Defendant Dershowitz could answer, Mr. Dershowitz’s legal counsel interposed an attorney-client
privilege objection. /d. Perhaps Mr. Epstein’s defense counsel can provide to the Court an
appropriate privilege log regarding that objection — and all the communications between Mr.
Epstein and Defendant Dershowitz that would have been revealed in answer to that question — so

that the Court will have the benefit of a full record in ruling on this motion.

Conclusion: The Future of Freedom of Speech

Although most Americans support freedom of speech in the abstract, far fewer support speech
that hurts them. Free speech for me but not for thee is a common limitation. Let me propose a
test for my own readers to see whether you qualify to join “the First Amendment Club.”

Do you really believe in the freedom of speech guaranteed by our First Amendment? Or do you
just support the speech of those with whom you agree? Nearly two hundred years ago, the
French philosopher Voltaire articulated the fundamental premise underlying true support for
freedom of speech: “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say
i,

Defending “to the death” may be a bit strong and “disapprove” a bit weak, but the core of
Voltaire’s point is crucial. It is easy, and rather self-serving, to rally ‘round the flag of the First
Amendment on behalf of those whose speech you admire or enjoy. But unless you are prepared
to defend the freedom to speak of those whom you despise—those who make your blood
boil—you cannot count yourself as a member of that rather select club of true believers in
freedom of expression.

I call it a select club because most people, even most who claim adherence to the First
Amendment, favor some censorship. Deep down, clearly everyone wants to censor something. I
have Jewish friends who support freedom of expression for everyone—except for Nazis who
want to march through Jewish neighborhoods like Skokie, Illinois. I have African-American
friends who support freedom of speech for everyone—except those who would try to justify
racism. I have women friends who support freedom of speech for everyone—except those who
are in the business of selling sexist pornography. And the list goes on.

When I spoke at a rally of artists, museum curators, and gallery owners protesting the prosecution
of the Cincinnati museum curator who had exhibited the Mappelthorpe photographs of naked
children and homosexual adults, it was a very self-serving rally. Of course, artists, museum
curators, and gallery owners would protest the censorship of art! Art is their business, after all.

When I represented the musical Hair, which had been “banned in Boston” back in the sixties, of
course we got the support of the theater crowd. No one should be surprised that the leader of the
rock band 2 Live Crew has become a First Amendment maven, since his rap lyrics have been
censored. When the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was prevented from opening an
information office in Washington, it was predictable that Arab-American supporters of the PLO
would cry “First Amendment foul.” It was not as predictable that many Jewish supporters of
Israel followed my lead in opposing such censorship.

And what about the classic of self-serving promotion of the Bill of Rights: The Philip Morris
sponsorship of TV ads praising the First Amendment at a time when Congress was considering
further limitations on cigarette advertising, or corporate support for the First Amendment right to
make unlimited contributions to political campaigns. You do not have to be a supporter of
freedom of speech to protest when the government tries to censor the speech of those who are
goring your ox.

Remote monitoring technology aims to keep seniors in their houses and out of nursing homes

Over the coming months a raft of new-and-improved remote monitoring devices will hit the
market, from GPS shoes that can track the whereabouts of wandering seniors to MedCottages,
portable RV-like units equipped with motion and monitoring systems that allow seniors to
maintain some independence from the backyard of their adult childrens’ homes.

“As we age, this is going to be a growing trend,” says Laurie Orlov, a Florida-based expert on so-
called “aging-in-place technology” aimed at keeping seniors in their houses and out of nursing
homes as long as possible.

“We have to get past the fear and antagonism among the older people who need it the most. I don’t
think they’re that technology-ready, but the boomers, who are their adult children, certainly are.”
Motion sensors strategically placed in the three-bedroom home where Howe has lived for 53 years
feed information right to her daughter’s laptop, detailing when she got out of bed (the Friday we
chatted it was 9 a.m.), walked into the bathroom (9:15 a.m.) or hovered at the kitchen table where
she keeps her pills (9:30 a.m.)

Even her blood-pressure reading (165/76) is fed to her daughter’s computer, along with her daily
weigh-in tally, providing a detailed graph which she often takes to her doctor appointments.

The only thing GrandCare can’t tell Pierce, because her system doesn’t include cameras, is if her
mother actually swallowed her pills.

Monitoring and in-home help technologies will be a $20 billion U.S. business in North America by
2020, predicts Orlov, founder of Aging In Place Technology Watch.

a clumsy word that attempts to denote those of us who are motivated to do BDSM for

professional BDSM, the overlap can be surprisingly rare, and professional BDSM is often
banned at lifestyle BDSM parties. Lifestyle dungeons are often non-profit organizations,

advocate male-head-of-household marriage. There are even websites for Christians who
are interested in BDSM. But there are very few websites for people who are interested in
male-led intimate relationships but who are not interested in all that the above
communities associate with this kind of relationship (jargon, clothes, etc.) Some of us
don't even like thinking of this as a lifestyle.

Well, my friend, you know what... you can refuse to call yourself BDSM all you want,
and you can reject our jargon all you want, and you can dislike thinking of this
lifestyle until the end of time... and you have every right to insist that we have nothing
to do with you. But when your site has posts that include comments like When my
husband behaves in a dominant manner I basically swoon, or have titles like Don't
forget your whip, well... I'm just saying.

Also, since you mention rejecting BDSM clothes? I'll just say that I can be an
astoundingly badass domme in a t-shirt. And I have done so. Multiple times.

Personally, I am particularly frustrated by the stigmatizing idea that BDSM has nothing
to do with love. Sometimes I encounter this idea that BDSM has to be separated from sex
because BDSM has nothing to do with sex, whereas sex supposedly should be about
love. The truth is that both BDSM and sex are very different for different people,
emotions-wise. Although many people experiment with casual BDSM, the same way
many people experiment with casual sex, a stereotype that BDSMers cannot find love
in the act is wrong and absurd.

So yeah. Nowadays, many of these BDSM versus sex reactions strike me as being born
out of pure, irrational stigma. As Dr. Klein noted, these reactions are usually born of the
terrible human urge to exclude: to find ways to differentiate ourselves from those
people. Humans apparently love to think things like: I'm not like those people. It
doesn't matter if I, for example, write extensive rape fantasy fiction! That couldn't

officials to these three key questions “proved maddeningly diffi-
cult.” He found that in mid-June NSA officials with whom he dealt
were so “distraught at the massive security breach” that initially
they refused to allow even CIA officers to participate in the ongoing
security review. A former NSA executive told me there was “near
panic” at the NSA. Finally, Morell called Chris Inglis, a former pro-
fessor of computer science who had risen to be the NSA’s deputy
director at the time of the breach. Inglis, who headed operations for
the NSA, told him “the news was not good.” Among the data copied
by Snowden were a large number of CIA secrets. By the time the
CIA learned that its secrets had been compromised, Snowden was
headed to Russia.

The investigation of a crime involving potential espionage is no
easy task. In this case, it required attempting to solve a jigsaw puz-
zle in which not only were key pieces missing but also, because it
involved adversary intelligence services, some of the found pieces
might deliberately have been twisted to mislead the U.S. investigators.

By late July, NSA investigators had made their initial assessment.

© They determined that most of the material had been taken from ©
sealed-off areas known in intelligence speak as “compartments,”
which in this case were files stored on computers that were isolated
from any network. Each compartment electronically tracks all the
activities that occur in it on its logs, including the password identity
of any person who has gained entry to any compartment. From a
forensic examination of these logs, NSA investigators were quickly
able to reconstruct the timeline of the theft. The logs showed that an
unauthorized party without proper passwords had begun copying
files in mid-April, which was just days after Snowden began his job
at the center. The illicit activity ended just before Snowden’s last day
of work there. So this piece fit in with Snowden’s guilt.

The size of the theft was another matter. Ledgett was certainly in
a position to know (in the shake-up that followed, he would replace
Inglis as deputy director of the NSA). According to Ledgett, the per-
petrator had “touched” 1.7 million documents, moving from com-
partment to compartment. Of these “touched” documents, according
to the analysis of the logs, more than one million of them had been
moved by the unauthorized party in mid-May to an auxiliary com-

Dear Fellow Ritz-Carlton Club Member, 
If you've been following the TV news, you already know that St. Thomas has taken a dreadful hit by 
Hurricane Irma. President Donald Trump, who has authorized disaster relief for the Virgin Islands, plans to 
visit St. Thomas in the next six or seven days according to Governor Kenneth Mapp. 
Our Club appears to have stood up reasonably well, at least when compared with the devastation 
elsewhere on the island. Many homes have been reduced to rubble, including those of some of our employees 
as you have heard. The insurance adjusters arrived today, an important step in obtaining the detailed damage 
and insurance information. The damage seems to grow from the far end of the beach toward the Hotel, with 
only modest damage in the Lily Building, more damage in Gardenia and Heliconia and even more at the Hotel. 
About 40% of our Residences are currently usable—with electricity and air conditioning—and they are 
fully occupied mostly by our employees. Many of these employees have returned to work, notwithstanding the 
hardships in their personal lives. 70% of the exterior lighting has been restored. Road and pathways on our 
property have been cleared. Work has also begun on restoring the landscaping, which was decimated by Irma. 
The Food Center is back open. Some electricity has been restored in the downtown area. Many ATM machines 
are now operational but with most limiting cash withdrawals to $100. 
The airport is still closed to commercial traffic. We know that some of our roofs have been damaged. 
Our air conditioners have been damaged. Some windows were broken and some doors were blown in by the 
200 mph gusts. So we know there is water damage. But we don't know how much. Communication is still a 
major challenge. There is no internet service at the club yet and cell service on our side of the island is 
extremely spotty. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026759 
There has been some looting and other lawlessness in some areas. Local law enforcement is now 
supported by resources from our federal and state governments. Our on-site team reports that we have 
been spared that threat. In addition to our own Loss Prevention staff, our Management Company has 
hired an independent security team to help protect our property. 
One of the most important questions we must address is just when our Club might open again. The 
Club is closed through October 7 and Member Services is not presently taking any reservations through 
December 17. There is a strong possibility that our re-start date could hinge on when the rest of St. 
Thomas recovers, and it is simply impossible to predict that date at this time. Your Board and the 
Management team are monitoring this closely and we will keep you apprised. 
And finally, we thank all who have contributed to the GBCOA Employee Relief Fund. Our Ladies 
and Gentlemen are in desperate need of your help. They deeply appreciate whatever you may offer to 
help, as does the Board. Thank you!

BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. Mr. Cassell, is it your testimony that, from
Mr. Rodriguez's testimony about how often he says
Professor Dershowitz visited in a 2004/2005 time frame,
it's fair to draw an inference about how often he
visited in an earlier -- three-year earlier time frame?

A. In the circumstances of this case,
absolutely.

Q. And would it be fair to infer from the number
of times that Donald Trump visited three years later,
how often he visited at an earlier period?

A. I did not investigate the circumstances
involving Trump. He wasn't somebody that was coming up.

Q. Were you aware on December 30th of 2014 that
Donald Trump was quoted in Vanity Fair as saying: I've
known Jeff -- referring to Epstein -- oh, I'm sorry.

It was a New Yorker Magazine, not Vanity Fair, That he
was quoted as saying: I've known Jeff -~ referring to
Epstein -- for 15 years. Terrific quy. And he's a fot

of fun to be with.” It even said that: He likes
beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on
the younger side. No doubt about it, Jeffrey enjoys the
social ~~ social life? Were you aware of that on
December 30th, 2014?

A. Possibly. I mean that sounds vaguely
familiar. Trump has just not been somebody that -- that
I’ve paid much attention to in this case.

Q. Based on that statement, and the facts we
discussed earlier about Mr. Trump visiting and being a
friend, and the other circumstances we discussed, are
you suspicious about whether he engaged in sexual
misconduct with minors?

MS. McCAWLEY: I'm going to object to the
extent that you can't reveal anything that my
client has informed you of,

THE WITNESS: Right. If we set aside that
information, I'm not -- I'm not suspicious, no,
not given the information I have.

BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. Okay. So notwithstanding that his name is
circled in the address book, he was a good friend, he
visited often, and he was quoted as saying that Jeff was
a terrific guy who liked young women almost as much as
Trump did, you're not even suspicious?

The Weekly Standard

The Illusion of Peace with Syria

Elhott Abrams

May 23, 2011 -- The news from Syria grows grimmer by the day—
more peaceful protesters killed, ten thousand arrested in the past
week, army units shelling residential neighborhoods.

But the Obama administration’s response has not grown grimmer or
louder. As recently as May 6, Secretary of State Clinton was still
talking about a “reform agenda” in Syria, as if Bashar al-Assad were
a slightly misguided bureaucrat rather than the murderer of roughly
1,000 unarmed demonstrators. As for the president, though the White
House has issued a couple of statements in his name, he has yet to say
one word on camera about the bloodletting in Syria. This is not a
small matter, for a tough statement attacking the regime’s repression
and giving the demonstrators moral support would immediately
circulate over the Internet. American sanctions against Syria,
meanwhile, have not named Assad, and there has been no call for him
to step down.

Why is the administration appearing to stick with Assad and refusing
to call for his ouster? A key reason may be the hope that an Israeli-
Syrian peace deal can be arranged.

From the day it came to office, the Obama administration clearly
wanted to win an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. There has been
no progress during its two years in office, mostly because the White
House insisted on a 100 percent construction freeze in the West Bank
settlements and Jerusalem as a precondition for negotiations. This
was politically impossible in Israel, and also meant that Palestinian
president Mahmoud Abbas could not come to the table lest he appear
to be asking less from Israel than the Americans.

Thomas in a discussion about Roe v. Wade. Unfortunately, then-Senator

REFINANCING TRANSFER AGREEMENTS

On August 6, 2018, in connection with a refinancing transaction, we purchased finance receivables we had previously sold under the 2017
Master Transfer Agreement and simultaneously entered into a transfer agreement with a purchaser trust under which the trust immediately purchased such
finance receivables from us. On December 21, 2018, in connection with another refinancing transaction, we purchased finance receivables we had
previously sold under the 2017 Master Transfer Agreement and simultaneously entered into another transfer agreement with a purchaser trust under which
the trust purchased such finance receivables and other finances receivables from us. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold approximately
$477.9 million in principal balances of finance receivables under these transfer agreements.

The trusts engaged Carvana as the administrator of the trust and DriveTime as servicer of the receivables. In the year ended December 31,
2018, we had aggregate earnings of $0.0 thousand for performing trust administrator functions for the purchasers and DriveTime had aggregate earnings of
$1.5 million for performing servicing functions.

MASTER DEALER AGREEMENT

In December 2016, we entered into a master dealer agreement with DriveTime. Pursuant to this agreement, we may sell vehicle service
contracts (“VSCs”) to customers purchasing a vehicle from us. We earn a commission on each VSC sold to our customers and DriveTime is obligated by
and subsequently administers the VSCs. We collect the retail purchase price of the VSCs from our customers and remit the purchase price net of
commission to DriveTime. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized approximately $23.7 million of commissions earned on VSCs sold to
our customers and administered by DriveTime, net of a reserve for estimated contract cancellations. On November 5, 2018 (effective October 1, 2018), we
amended the master dealer agreement to allow Carvana to receive payments for excess reserves based on the performance of the VSCs versus the reserves
held by the VSC administrator, once a required claims period for such VSCs has passed. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Carvana recognized
approximately $1.9 million related to payments for excess reserves to which it expects to be entitled.

Beginning in 2017, DriveTime also administers a portion of our GAP waiver coverage and the limited warranty provided to all customers under
the master dealer agreement. We pay a per-contract fee to DriveTime to administer a portion of the GAP waiver coverage we sell to our customers and a
per-vehicle fee to DriveTime to administer the limited warranty included with every purchase. We incurred costs of approximately $2.2 million during the
year ended December 31, 2018, related to the administration of GAP waiver coverage and limited warranty.

shape of sex organs, and various sex toys, such as a “twin torpedo” vibrator and creams and lubricants available at
erotic specialty shops, were stowed near the massage tables set up in several rooms upstairs.

Epstein also enlisted his staff in the predatory activity, and four—Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, and
Marcinkova—figured in the FBI investigation. The Non Prosecution Agreement stipulated that they would not be
charged. According to police reports and sworn statements in the civil suits, all four women, among their other duties,
worked to ensure that an appointment book for twice- or thrice-daily “massages” was stocked with fresh recruits.
Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late Czechoslovakian-born press baron Robert Maxwell, who was for many years
Epstein’s live-in partner, also recruited young girls.

Since his 13-month sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor, Epstein has settled more than a dozen lawsuits
brought by underage girls. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each
received well over $1 million—an amount that will hardly dent Epstein’s $2 billion net worth.

The victims told police they waited in the kitchen to be called upstairs for a massage, and the house chef often gave
them a bite to eat. House manager Alfredo Rodriguez said in his sworn statement that a maid named Lupita, who was
a devout Catholic, wept when she complained to him about cleaning up after the massage sessions, picking up soiled
towels and putting away the sex toys. And she was upset that a photo of Epstein with the pope hung next to one of
him with a young girl.

Ironically, Rodriguez, who ran the house on EI Brillo Way in 2004 and 2005, ended up being sentenced to more jail
time than his boss as a result of the complex investigation into Epstein’s activities. He was fired, he says, for
inadvertently drawing police attention to one of the girls when she arrived at the house unannounced to collect money.
He saw an unfamiliar “beater” in the driveway one evening and called 911. When he left Epstein’s employ, Rodriguez
took away some notes and emails about massage appointments as “protection” against his own prosecution, and
failed to produce them during the Palm Beach Police Department’s initial investigation.

Unable to get work as a house manager elsewhere in South Florida, he says, Rodriguez later tried to sell this “golden
nugget’—his term—for $50,000, to be used in the victims’ civil suits. Unfortunately, he made the offer to an
undercover cop, and was subsequently charged with “obstruction of official proceedings” for withholding information
that could have advanced the criminal investigation of Epstein—which by that point had been settled in a plea deal.
Rodriguez was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison (Epstein was allowed to serve 13 months in the Palm Beach
county jail), and now awaits an additional sentence on Aug. 24 in federal court in Miami for transporting firearms,
another deal he says he made to pay the bills after he lost his job.

In a deposition given for the civil suits, Rodriguez testified that he was instructed to always have $2,000 in cash on
hand, so that he could pay both the girls who gave massages and recruiters such as Haley Robson who brought them
to the house. He also testified that Epstein made large contributions to the Palm Beach Police Department, and in
return was given PBPD baseball hats to put on the dashboard of his various cars to avoid being stopped or ticketed by
local police. Retired Police Chief Michael Reiter, in his own deposition, acknowledged that, in addition to earlier
donations to the police department (which are fairly common in well-heeled Palm Beach), Epstein had recently given
the department $100,000 for some sophisticated equipment. The police were still researching the purchase when
Epstein came under suspicion, and Reiter ordered the money returned. (Guy Frostin, one of Epstein’s local attorneys,
told police that Epstein also gave $100,000 to the Florida Ballet for massages, because he was “very passionate”
about massages being “therapeutically and spiritually” beneficial. Yet victims told police they had no massage
training.)

Perhaps most disturbing, in terms of possible sex trafficking, was Epstein’s relationship with Jean Luc Brunel, owner
of the MC2 modeling agency. According to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Florida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, Maxwell, Brunel, Rodriguez, and Marcinkova “deliberately engaged in a
pattern of racketeering that involved luring minor children through MC2, mosily girls under the age of 17, to engage in
sexual play for money.” (Which would amount to trafficking.)

Brunel is a 50-plus French playboy who was formerly part owner of Karin, a Paris-based modeling agency. He lives in
New York and South Beach, Florida, and owns 85 percent of MC2, which has offices in New York, Miami, and Tel

This is a hypothesis that is shared by a growing number of people these days. In humans, it is reflected for
instance by the fact that races with faster motor development have lower IQ. (In individuals of the same
group, slower development often indicates defects, of course.)

Another support comes from machine learning: we find that the same learning functions can learn visual and
auditory pattern recognition, and even end-to-end-learning. Google has built automatic image recognition into
their current photo app:
http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/07/01/google-mistakenly-tags-black-people-as-gorillas-showing-limits-of-
algorithms/

The state of the art in research can do better than that: it can begin to Imagine things. I.e. when the
experimenter asks the system to dream what a certain object looks like, the system can produce a somewhat
compelling image, which indicates that it is indeed learning visual structure. This stuff is something nobody
could do a few months ago:

http://www.creativeai.net/posts/Mv4 WGé6rdzAerZF7ch/synthesizing-preferred-inputs-via-deep-generator-

networks

A machine learning program that can learn how to play an Atari game without any human supervision or
hand-crafted engineering (the feat that gave DeepMind 500M from Google) now just takes about 130 lines of
Python code.

These models do not have interesting motivational systems, and a relatively simple architecture. They
currently seem to mimic some of the stuff that goes on in the first few layers of the cortex. They learn object
features, visual styles, lighting and rotation in 3d, and simple action policies. Almost everything else is
missing. But there is a lot of enthusiasm that the field might be on the right track, and that we can learn motor
simulations and intuitive physics soon. (The majority of the people in AI do not work on this, however. They
try to improve the performance for the current benchmarks.)

Noam's criticism of machine translation mostly applies to the Latent Semantic Analysis models that Google
and others have been using for many years. These models map linguistic symbols to concepts, and relate
concepts to each other, but they do not relate the concepts to proper mental representations of what objects
and processes look like and how they interact. Concepts are probably one of the top layers of the learning
hierarchy, i.e. they are acquired *after* we learn to simulate a mental world, not before. Classical linguists
ignored the simulation of a mental world entirely.

It seems miraculous that purely conceptual machine translation works at all, but that is because concepts are
shared between speakers, so the structure of the conceptual space can be inferred from the statistics of
language use. But the statistics of language use have too little information to infer what objects look like and
how they interact.

My own original ideas concern a few parts of the emerging understanding of what the brain does. The
request-confirmation networks that I have introduced at a NIPS workshop in last the December are an

attempt at modeling how the higher layers might self-organize into cognitive programs.

Cheers!

MR. SCAROLA: Professor Cassell, you don't
need to do that.
BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. If I understand you correctly, you said in
that answer question -- strike that.

If I understood you correctly, you said in
that answer that there was a universe of 24 girls I
believe you said or approximately, that Professor
Dershowitz may or may not have abused; is that your
position?

A. That's correct. It's been impossible to
narrow down exactly what happened because of lack of
cooperation from, for example, Jeffrey Epstein.

Q. If as of December 30th, 2014, based on your
information, Professor Dershowitz may or may not have
abused other minors, why did you allege that he did?

A. Your question, as I understood it, was did I
know the name of the particular girl that he may or may
not have alleged -- I'm sorry -- did I know the name of
the particular girl that he may have abused. And I
couldn't get the exact name, but what I had was
Mr. Dershowitz receiving massages in a time when,
according to the police report, massage was a code word
for sexual abuse of underage girls.

Do societies inevitably face a choice between efficient production and the equitable distribution of income? According
to IMF economists Andrew Berg, Jonathan Ostry, and Jeromin Zettelmeyer, the answer is no. They argue that the
empirical literature on growth and inequality using long-run average growth may have missed how income distribution

is tied to abrupt ends in growth.

Their work examined growth over a long time horizon, between 1950 and 2006, focusing on the duration of growth
spells, and showed that there may be no trade-off between efficiency and equality (51). In fact, they posited that
equality could be an important component of sustained growth, observing that the level of inequality may be the key
difference between countries that enjoy extended, rapid expansion and those whose growth spurts quickly dissipate. In

short, promoting greater equality may also improve efficiency in the form of more sustainable long-run growth.

Of the number of variables associated with longer growth spells, income inequality's relationship with the duration of
growth spells was the strongest (see chart 8). They found that a 10% decrease in inequality (a change in the Gini

coefficient to 0.37 from 0.40) increases the expected length of a growth spell by 50%.

Chinese Influence Operations
Bureaucracy

While recent months have brought increased attention to the United Front Work
Department, or “United Front activities,” it is important to emphasize that this is
but one of many institutions within the Chinese party-state involved in influence
operations. As the accompanying graphic illustrates, the bureaucracy involved in
extending China’s global influence is large, complex, and specialized in function.
Generally speaking, there are three types of bureaucratic organizations included in
the chart: (1) policy coordination; (2) policy formulation and implementation; and

(3) organizations with specialized functions.

As a Leninist party-state, CCP organizations have higher political status than
government institutions. This has become even more pronounced under the Party’s
general secretary Xi Jinping and following the bureaucratic reorganization announced
after the March 2018 meeting of the National People’s Congress. Generally speaking,
Party organs make policies, which are then implemented by state bureaucracies. There
is no single organization overseeing the entirety of the country’s influence operations
abroad. The most important CCP organizations in the diagram are the Foreign Affairs
Commission, the External Propaganda Leading Group/State Council Information
Office, the CCP Propaganda Department, the CCP United Front Work Department,
the CCP International Liaison Department, and United Front departments inside the
People’s Liberation Army. Critical policies related to foreign affairs are formulated

in these bodies. The same organizations are also involved in coordinating the

implementation of these policies.

The Policy-Making Process in the Chinese Party-State

The process is driven both by top leadership and functional bureaucracies. Policy
formulation, which involves the generation of ideas and proposals, typically

takes place in functional bureaucracies and specialized departments within these
bureaucracies. In the process of policy formulation, one bureaucracy specializing

in the functional or issue area (for example, propaganda) may take charge, but it

1 am. And then, the police kept his passport for six months before he could finally leave the country.

On the stand, he cried when he spoke about the ordeal.

Isaacson in his closing repeatedly called it extortion. “Because when the bank held Mr. Scudder's passport--I'm
sorry, caused his passport to held, that just didn't cause personal pain for Mr. Scudder,” he said. “What it did
was give the opportunity for the bank to control the technology, to control the situation, because now InfoSpan
couldn't compete in the UAE because of the fears that this type of thing would happen. And it also gave him
the opportunity to try and extort money and control of the technology from InfoSpan.”

How do you counter that?
Ruemmler was not available for an interview, but Schecter said pretrial research showed people expect that if
you do business overseas, you’ll comply with the laws of the foreign country. And in UAE, this is how they

handle fraud.

“Judge Selna has instructed you that filing a criminal complaint in Dubai for fraud is a common practice and
that if you've been cheated, that's what you're supposed to do,” Ruemmler said.

What about Scudder’s emotional testimony?

She undercut it without coming across as callous--a fine line.

“Now, I have to mention the tears. And this is the only thing I'm going to say about it,” Ruemmler said. “He
was detained for less than 24 hours, nine years ago; and then, he was in his corporate apartment and had
$300,000 to live for, like, about six months. I'm just going to say this: I will leave to you to evaluate the
sincerity of those tears in light of all the other evidence that you have heard in this case.”

And then she immediately talked about how he “basically, had faked a document.”

It worked. After about a day of deliberation, the jury found across the board for Emirates NBD Bank.

“Tt was a binary case--either they lied or we lied,” said Schecter. “The plaintiff's strategy was all or nothing.
There were no off-ramps for the jury.”

The Latham team also included counsel Andrew Fossum and associates Nima Mohebbi, Stephanie Grace,
Jonathan Sandler, Jacquelyn Levien, Elizabeth Greenman, Pushkal Mishra and Tom Rickeman.

In a statement to The Lit Daily, Lubna Qassim, chief group general counsel and company secretary of the
Emirates NBD, said, While there was no basis for this case being tried in U.S. courts, Emirates NBD Bank is
deeply gratified by the jury's decision and appreciates the court's commitment to ensuring a fair trial.”

by John Brockman

Seth Lloyd: Wrong, but More Relevant Than Ever
It is exactly in the extension of the cybernetic idea to human beings that Wiener’s
conceptions missed their target.

Judea Pearl: The Limitations of Opaque Learning Machines

Deep learning has its own dynamics, it does its own repair and its own optimization, and
it gives you the right results most of the time. But when it doesn’t, you don’t have a clue
about what went wrong and what should be fixed.

Stuart Russell: The Purpose Put Into the Machine

We may face the prospect of superintelligent machines—their actions by definition
unpredictable by us and their imperfectly specified objectives conflicting with our own—
whose motivation to preserve their existence in order to achieve those objectives may be
insuperable.

George Dyson: The Third Law

Any system simple enough to be understandable will not be complicated enough to
behave intelligently, while any system complicated enough to behave intelligently will be
too complicated to understand.

Daniel C. Dennett: What Can We Do?
We don’t need artificial conscious agents. We need intelligent tools.

Rodney Brooks: The Inhuman Mess Our Machines Have Gotten Us Into
We are ina much more complex situation today than Wiener foresaw, and I am worried
that it is much more pernicious than even his worst imagined fears.

Frank Wilczek: The Unity of Intelligence

The advantages of artificial over natural intelligence appear permanent, while the
advantages of natural over artificial intelligence, though substantial at present, appear
transient.

Max Tegmark: Let’s Aspire to More Than Making Ourselves Obsolete
We should analyze what could go wrong with AI to ensure that it goes right.

Jaan Tallinn: Dissident Messages

Continued progress in AI can precipitate a change of cosmic proportions—a runaway
process that will likely kill everyone.

was representing a series of vastly wealthy people and
families—not just doing their bidding or their investing,
but helping them to navigate the ambitions of their
wealth. If they had big dreams before, it’s nothing to
what they can have now.

If early in his career he might have seemed like a
sort of George Peppard (there’s a physical resemblance)
in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, a charming hustler, later he’s
George Peppard in Banacek, a smart and astute operator.
At just about this point in the narrative, the
incredulity about Epstein began to circulate in social
circles. Epstein had acquired the major symbols of
wealth but without position, public holdings, or
obvious paper trails. His is a questionable substrata of
wealth, without institutional credentials or bona fides.
He’s a freelancer. That’s the rub: he doesn’t work for
anyone.

There is no clear alternate narrative, except perhaps
guilt by association. (In addition to Robert Maxwell,
who will be accused of fraud, there’s Steven
Hoffenberg, briefly a New York high flyer, who went to
jail for a Ponzi scheme, for whom Epstein acted as a
consultant—along with, he points out, Paul Volcker.)
But the characterization persists: if it’s not clear, it must
be murky. Sure, Goldman Sachs partners and tech
geniuses, they might have stratospheric wealth, but what
to make of a Coney Island, Zelig-like no-namer?

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011549.txt,"We were as ready as we were ever going to be. We got the final go-ahead
from in mid-February. Our backpacks were crammed full with the whole array
of equipment we’d designed, commandeered or purchased for the mission —
including a metal detector we got from a hobby shop in Pennsylvania. All the
cargo except our personal gear, our weapons and our communications
equipment was loaded onto the cart. A command post was set up in a few
wooden huts on Mount Keren in the Negev, complete with special antennas to
receive the intercept transmissions if we succeeded. Not since the first Golan
operation had the attention of the kirya been so keen, or the stakes so high. In
addition to Meir Amit, and of course Avraham, also flying down to Mount
Keren would be General Tzur’s successor as armed forces chief of staff —a
gruff Palmach veteran whom I’d met very briefly at the end of my officer’s
course but who I would come to know well, and work closely with, in the years
ahead: Yitzhak Rabin.

The helicopter lifted off at about six-thirty at night. Compared to special
operations nowadays, the mission still had a somewhat improvised feel about it.
Certainly, that was true of the equipment we were ferrying in, and the tools
we'd devised to make sure we could get it installed and working. But the men in
my team were soldiers I’d trained from the day they arrived in the sayeret.
Achihud Madar was unfailingly surefooted, whether finding his way alone at
night on unfamiliar ground or in a firefight inside a building. He also had
natural dexterity. He and another of the soldiers who was also gifted with his
hands, Nissim Jou’ari, would be performing the most technically delicate part of
the operation on the cable. The third member was Oded Rabinovitch. Tall, thin
and quiet, he was absolutely reliable in whatever part of an operation he was
given to execute. And as my deputy commander, I’d chosen a sayeret officer
named Kobi Meron, who’d been with me on a number of Golan missions. Over
six feet tall, he was probably the strongest man in the unit, quick-thinking and
utterly unflappable.

When we landed, we telescoped out the axles on the cart. The roar of the
departing chopper was replaced by silence. Under the soft light of hundreds of
stars, I led the way deeper into the desert. It took nearly an hour to reach the
road leading to the cable site. Though traffic was light, I posted Oded and

It looked more to me like the secret handiwork of a lawyer intent on smearing Trump.

If so, however, there was no way to hold anyone accountable. The phone number provided was
disconnected and Johnson’s address was an abandoned, foreclosed house.

The allegations in the latest complaint by “Jane Doe” are the same, albeit with fewer lurid details and
no explanation why she is no longer Katie Johnson. But the biggest difference is that she’s got
lawyers now.

In addition to Mason, “Jane Doe” is represented—improbably—by New Jersey patent litigator
Thomas Meagher, the managing partner of nine-lawyer IP boutique Meagher Emanuel Laks Goldberg
& Liao.

Mason and Meagher did not respond to requests for comment.

Campaign finance records show that Mason gave $2,000 to Hillary Clinton in February. Meagher
during this election cycle has donated to Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush. He has
never given money to a Democrat, according to Open Secrets data.

So is the suit for real? Or is it an especially dirty way to attack Donald Trump?

There’s a You Tube video of the plaintiff, with her faced blurred and her voice distorted, where she
recounts the rape. Under these conditions, it’s impossible to tell if she’s credible or not.

The complaint also includes an affidavit from “Joan Doe,” a school friend who said the plaintiff told
her about the rapes in 1994, and from “Tiffany Doe,” who said she recruited the plaintiff to come to
Epstein’s parties and witnessed the sexual assaults. So perhaps more evidence will emerge to bolster
Jane Doe’s claims.

On the other hand, if the complaint is determined to be without merit, Mason and Meagher could be
sanctioned by the court for filing a frivolous lawsuit.

Or Trump could respond like Alan Dershowitz, who was also accused of sexual misconduct with a
minor in connection with Epstein. The Harvard Law School professor said lawyers for the accuser
acted unethically and fabricated the allegations; in turn, they sued him for defamation. The case
settled earlier this year on undisclosed terms.

In the Trump case, U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams set an initial conference for Dec. 16. The real
question: if Clinton wins, will this case simply disappear?

The surprising results of yesterday’s election have teed
up comprehensive tax reform asa clear priority for the
new Republican President and the Republican Congress.
A unified Republican government makes the process of
achieving significant tax reform much more manageable
next year, in particular because Speaker Ryan during the
campaign pledged to move such a plan in the form of so-
called budget reconciliation legislation, which would mean
that only a simple majority of senators would be
necessary to pass the plan, rather than the usual 60-vote
majority. Alot of the groundwork has been laid through
proposals and negotiationsover the last three or four
years on various key aspects of businesstax reform, but
Congressional Republican leaders and the new President
will have to decide whether to push forward with
legislation that embodies the House Republican Tax
Reform Blueprint, or the outlines of atax reform plan that
President-elect Trump championed during the campaign.
One significant difference is that the Blueprint, according
to its authors, is largely revenue neutral using dynamic
scoring, while the Trump plan was scored by various non-
governmental groups as losing trillions of dollars.

House Speaker Ryan has said on multiple occasions that
tax reform is his top priority. The Blueprint, the sixth and
final plank of Ryan’s “Better Way” campaign to provide
policy alternatives, proposed a 20%statutory corporate
tax rate, a 25%businesstax rate for pass-through
entities, a move toward a cash-flow consumption tax
through immediate expensing for all businesses and
elimination of deductibility of net interest expense, a
territorial international tax system, a border tax
adjustment mechanism, and elimination of most business
preferences except the R&D tax credit and LIFO.
Interestingly, all of these pieces of businesstax reform
may be fair game in discussions with Democrats, but the
two parties differ greatly over whether to reduce
individual tax rates —a key component of both the
Blueprint and the Trump campaign agenda —and over
important revenue issues, including whether reform
should be revenue neutral on a static basis, and whether
timing and one-timerevenue raisers should be used to
pay for permanent tax rate reduction. The use of budget
reconciliation, however, could make many of these
differencesirrelevant as Senate Democrats could have
little power to change or block the legislation on the
Senate floor.

Along with the 20%statutory corporate tax rate, the
Blueprint includes a 25 %business tax rate for pass-
through entities; and individual rates set at 12% 25% and
33%

Ways and Means Republican tax staff is in the process of
receiving feedback and building out the tax reform
Blueprint by drafting detailed statutory language. The
publicly expressed goal isto have that effort completed
by the end of 2016. In October 14 remarks at University
of Wisconsin-Madison, House Speaker Ryan said, “| really
want to get tax reform running as quickly as possible..:

Asked September 29 whether there is opportunity for
progress on big-ticket itemsin 2017, Senate Majority
Leader McConnell said, “We need to do tax-reform —
comprehensive tax-reform —not piecemeal.”

Trump's tax plan differs from the Blueprint in that the
corporate tax rate would be lower —15%-—with the same
rate imposed on pass through entities. The latest
statement from the Trump campaign suggests that small
business owners do not retain earnings may face double
taxation.

Individual income tax rates would be 12% 25% and 33%
the same as the House Republican tax reform Blueprint.

Trump and his staff have supported a 10%tax rate on the
deemed repatriation of previously untaxed foreign
earnings of US companies, but the campaign never made
clear whether they still support repeal of deferral ina new
international tax system going forward.

Trump has pledged to work with House Republicans on
tax issues and, in addition to adopting their proposed
individual rates, brought his plan closer to theirs by
announcing support for immediate expensing of new
business investments for manufacturers. The House plan
proposed expensing in conjunction with eliminating the
deductibility of net interest expense. In the follow-up toa
September 15 speech to the Economic Club of New York,
Trump clarified that he believes expensing should be
limited to manufacturers and those who elect expensing
will lose the deductibility of corporate interest expense.

The Trump campaign also clarified in September that they
favored repeal of most corporate tax expenditures,
except for the R&D Credit. While continuing to call for
repeal of the estate tax, Trump proposed disallowing a
step-up in basis for estates over $10 million: “The Trump
plan will repeal the death tax, but capital gains held until
death will be subject to tax, with the first $10 million tax-
free as under current law to exempt small businesses and
family farms. To prevent abuse, contributions of
appreciated assets into a private charity established by
the decedent or the decedent’s relatives will be
disallowed.”

Dear Judge Filip:

The Atlantic Building

Washington, DC 20004-1404 
CONFIDENTIAL 
In his confirmation hearings last fall, Judge Mukasey admirably lifted up the finest 
traditions of the Department of Justice in assuring the United States Senate, and the American 
people, of his solemn intent to ensure fairness and integrity in the administration of justice. Your 
own confirmation hearings echoed that bedrock determination to assure that the Department 
conduct itself with honor and integrity, especially in the enforcement of federal criminal law. 
We come to you in that spirit and respectfully ask for a review of the federal involvement 
in a quintessentially state matter involving our client, Jeffrey Epstein. While we are well aware 
of the rare instances in which a review of this sort is justified, we are confident that the 
circumstances at issue warrant such an examination. Based on our collective experiences, as 
well as those of other former senior Justice Department officials whose advice we have sought, 
we have never before seen a case more appropriate for oversight and review. Thus, while neither 
of us has previously made such a request, we do so now in the recognition that both the 
Department's reputation, as well as the due process rights of our client, are at issue. 
Recently, the Criminal Division concluded a very limited review of this matter at the 
request of U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta. Critically, however, this review deliberately excluded 
many important aspects of this case. Just this past Friday, on May 16, 2008, we received a letter 
from the head of CEOS informing us that CEOS had conducted a review of this case. By its own 
admission, the CEOS review was limited, both factually and legally. Part of the self-imposed 
limitation was CEOS's abstention from addressing our allegations of professional misconduct 
by federal prosecutors—even though such misconduct was, as we contend it is, inextricably 
intertwined with the credibility of the accusations being made against Mr. Epstein by the United 
States Attorney's Office in Miami (USAO). Moreover, CEOS did not assess the terms of the 
Deferred Prosecution Agreement now in effect, nor did CEOS review the federal prosecutors' 
inappropriate efforts to implement those terms. We detail this point below.

and, in his words, fair. That is not what occurred. Instead, CEOS has now acknowledged that 
we had raised many compelling arguments against the USAO's suggested novel application 
of federal law in this matter. Even so, CEOS concluded, in minimalist fashion, that we do not 
see anything that says to us categorically that a federal case should not be brought and that the 
U.S. Attorney would not be abusing his prosecutorial discretion should he authorize federal 
prosecution of Mr. Epstein thus delegating back to Mr. Acosta the decision of whether federal 
prosecution was warranted (emphasis added). Rather than assessing whether prosecution would 
be appropriate, CEOS, using a low baseline for its evaluation, determined only that it would not 
be impossible to prove . . . certain allegations made against Mr. Epstein. The CEOS review 
failed to address the significant problems involving the appearance of impermissible selectivity 
that would necessarily result from a federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein. 
We respect CEOS 's conclusion that its authority to review misconduct issues was 
precluded by Criminal Division practice. We further respect CEOS 's view that it understood its 
mission as significantly limited. Specifically, the contemplated objective was to determine 
whether the USAO would be abusing its discretion by bringing a federal prosecution rather than 
making its own de novo recommendations on the appropriate reach of federal law. However, we 
respectfully submit that a full review of all the facts is urgently needed at senior levels of the 
Justice Department. In an effort to inform you of the nature of the federal investigation against 
Mr. Epstein, we summarize the facts and circumstances of this matter below. 
The two base-level concerns we hold are that (1) federal prosecution of this matter is not 
warranted based on the purely-local conduct and the unprecedented application of federal 
statutes to facts such as these and (2) the actions of federal authorities are both highly 
questionable and give rise to an appearance of substantial impropriety. The issues that we have 
raised, but which have not yet been addressed or resolved by the Department, are more than 
isolated allegations of professional mistakes or misconduct. These issues, instead, affect the 
appearance and administration of criminal justice with profound consequences beyond the 
resolution in the matter at hand. 
In a precedent-shattering investigation of Jeffrey Epstein that raises important policy 
questions—and serious issues as to the fair and honorable enforcement of federal law—the 
USA° in Miami is considering extending federal law beyond the bounds of precedent and 
reason. Federal prosecutors stretched the underlying facts in ways that raise fundamental 
questions of basic professionalism. Perhaps most troubling, the USA° in Miami, as a condition 
of deferring prosecution, required a commingling of substantive federal criminal law with a 
proposed civil remedy engineered in a way that appears intended to profit particular lawyers in

private practice in South Florida with personal relationships to some of the prosecutors involved. 
Federal prosecutors then leaked highly sensitive information about the case to a New York 
Times reporter.' The immediate result of this confluence of extraordinary circumstances is an 
onslaught of civil lawsuits, all save one brought by the First Assistant's former boutique law firm 
in Miami. 
The facts in this case all revolve around the classic state crime of solicitation of 
prostitution.2 The State Attorney's Office in Palm Beach County had conducted a diligent 
investigation, convened a Grand Jury that returned an indictment, and made a final determination 
about how to proceed. That is where, in our federal republic, this matter should rest. 
Mr. Epstein faces a felony conviction in state court by virtue of his conduct, and the only reason 
the State has not resolved this matter is that the federal prosecutors in Miami have continued to 
insist that we, Mr. Epstein's counsel, approach and demand from the State Attorney's Office a 
harsher charge and a more severe punishment than that Office believes are appropriate under the 
circumstances. Yet despite the USAO's refusal to allow the State to resolve this matter on the 
terms the State has determined are appropriate, the USA() has not made any attempt to 
coordinate its efforts with the State. In fact, the USAO mandated that any federal agreement 
would be conditioned on Mr. Epstein persuading the State to seek a criminal punishment unlike 
that imposed on other defendants within the jurisdiction of the State Attorney for similar 
conduct. 
From the inception of the USAO's involvement in this case, which at the end of the day 
is a case about solicitation of prostitution within the confines of Palm Beach County, Florida, we 
have asked ourselves why the Department of Justice is involved. Regrettably, we are unable to 
suggest any appropriate basis for the Department's involvement. Mr. Epstein has no criminal 
history whatsoever. Also, Mr. Epstein has never been the subject of general media interest until 
a few years ago, after it was widely perceived by the public that he was a close friend of former 
President Bill Clinton. 
The conduct at issue is simply not within the purview of federal jurisdiction and lies 
outside the heartland of the three federal statutes that have been identified by prosecutors-18 
U.S.C. §§ 1591, 2422(b), and 2423(b). 
1 One of the other members of Mr. Epstein's defense team, Jay Leflcowitz, has personally reviewed the reporter's 
contemporaneous notes. 
2 Although some of the women alleged to be involved were 16 and 17 years of age, several of these women 
openly admitted to lying to Mr. Epstein about their age in their recent sworn statements. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 019226

These statutes are intended to target crimes of a truly national and international scope. 
Specifically, § 1591 was enacted to combat human trafficking, § 2422 is aimed at sexual 
predation of minors through the Internet, and § 2423 deals with sex tourism. The nature of these 
crimes results in multi-jurisdictional problems that state and local authorities cannot effectively 
confront on their own. However, Mr. Epstein's conduct was purely local in nature and, thus, 
does not implicate federal involvement. After researching every reported case brought under 18 
U.S.C. §§ 1591, 2422(b), and 2423(b), we found that not a single case involves facts or a 
scenario similar to the situation at hand. Our review of each precedent reflects that there have 
been no reported prosecutions under § 1591 of a'john' whose conduct with a minor lacked 
force, coercion, or fraud and who was not profiting from commercial sexual trafficking. There 
have likewise been no cases under § 2422(b)—a crime of communication—where there was no 
use of the Internet, and where the content of phone communications did not contain any inducing 
or enticing of a minor to have illegal sexual activity as expressly required by the language of the 
statute. Furthermore, the Government's contention that routine and habit can fill the factual 
and legal void created by the lack of evidence that such a communication ever occurred sets this 
case apart from every reported case brought under § 2422(b). Lastly, there are no reported cases 
of violations of § 2423(b) of a person whose dominant purpose in traveling was merely to go to 
his own home.3 
Although these matters were within the scope of the CEOS review, rather than 
considering whether federal prosecution is appropriate, CEOS only determined that U.S. 
Attorney Acosta would not be abusing his prosecutorial discretion should he authorize federal 
prosecution in this case. The abuse of discretion standard constitutes an extremely low bar of 
evaluation and while it may be appropriate when the consideration of issues are exclusively 
factual in nature, this standard fails to address concerns particular to this situation, namely the 
novel application of federal statutes. The abuse of discretion standard in such pure legal 
matters of statutory application risks causing a lack of uniformity. The same federal statutes that 
would be stretched beyond their bounds in Miami have been limited to their heartland in each of 
the other federal districts. Also, because this case implicates broader issues of the administration 
of equal justice, federal prosecution in this matter risks the appearance of selectivity in its 
stretching of federal law to fit these facts. 
3 
Federal prosecution of a man who engaged in consensual conduct in his home that amounted to, at most, the 
solicitation of prostitution, is unprecedented. Since prostitution is fundamentally a state concern, (see United 
States v. Evans, 476 F.3d 1176, n.1 (11th Cir. 2007) (federal law does not criminalize all acts of prostitution (a 
vice traditionally governed by state regulation))), and there is no evidence that Palm Beach County authorities 
and Florida prosecutors cannot effectively prosecute and punish the conduct, there is no reason why this matter 
should be extracted from the hands of state prosecutors in Florida.

In fact, recent testimony of several alleged victims contradicts claims made by federal 
prosecutors during the negotiations of a deferred prosecution agreement. The consistent 
representations of key Government witnesses (such as 
________________________________) confirm the following critical points: First, there was no 
communication, telephonic or otherwise, that meets the requirements of § 2422(b). For instance, 
Ms. confirmed that Mr. Epstein never emailed, text-messaged, or used any facility of 
interstate commerce whatsoever, before or after her one (and only) visit to his home. 
Tr. (deposition) at 30. Second, the women who testified admitted that they lied to Mr. Epstein 
about their age in order to gain admittance into his home. Indeed, the women who brought their 
underage friends to Mr. Epstein testified that they would counsel their friends to lie about their 
ages as well. Ms. stated the following: I would tell my girlfriends just like 
approached me. Make sure you tell him you're 18. Well, these girls that I brought, I know that 
they were 18 or 19 or 20. And the girls that I didn't know and I don't know if they were lying or 
not, I would say make sure that you tell him you're 18. Tr. at 22. Third, there was no 
routine or habit of improper communication expressing an intent to transform a massage into an 
illegal act. In fact, there was often no sexual activity at all during the massage. Ms. 
testified that [s]ometimes [Mr. Epstein] just wanted his feet massaged. Sometimes he 
just wanted a back massage. Tr. at 19. also stated that Mr. Epstein 
never touched [her] physically that all she did was massage[ ] his back, his chest and his 
thighs and that was it. Tr. at 12-13. Finally, there was no force, coercion, fraud, 
violence, drugs, or even alcohol present in connection with Mr. Epstein's encounters with these 
women. Ms. stated that [Mr. Epstein] never tried to force me to do anything. Tr. 
A at 12. These accounts are far from the usual testimony in sex slavery, Internet stings and sex 
tourism cases previously brought. The women in actuality were not younger than 16, which is 
the age of consent in most of the 50 states, and the sex activity was irregular and in large part, 
consisted of solo self-pleasuring. 
The recent crop of civil suits brought against Mr. Epstein confirm that the plaintiffs did 
not discuss any sexually-related activities with anyone prior to arriving at Mr. Epstein's 
residence. This reinforces our contention that no telephonic or Internet persuasion, inducement, 
enticement or coercion of a minor, or of any other individual, occurred. In addition, Mr. Jeffrey 
Herman, the former law partner of one of the federal prosecutors involved in this matter and the 
attorney for most of the civil complainants (as described in detail below), was quoted in the Palm 
Beach Post as saying that it doesn't matter that his clients lied about their ages and told Mr. 
Epstein that they were 18 or 19. 
Not only is a federal prosecution of this matter unwarranted, but the irregularity of 
conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the deferred prosecution agreement are 
beyond any reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor's responsibilities. The list of 
improprieties includes, but is not limited to, the following facts: 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 019228 
Honorable Mark Filip 
May 19, 2008 
Page 6 
• Federal prosecutors made the unprecedented demand that Mr. Epstein pay a 
minimum of $150,000 per person to an unnamed list of women they referred to as 
minors and whom they insisted required representation by a guardian ad litem. Mr. 
Epstein's counsel later established that all but one of these individuals were actually 
adults, not minors. Even then, though demanding payment to the women, the 
USAO eventually asserted that it could not vouch for the veracity of any of the 
claims that these women might make. 
• Federal prosecutors made the highly unusual demand that Mr. Epstein pay the fees 
of a civil attorney chosen by the prosecutors to represent these alleged victims 
should they choose to bring any civil litigation against him. They also proposed 
sending a notice to the alleged victims, stating, in an underlined sentence, that 
should they choose their own attorney, Mr. Epstein would not be required to pay 
their fees. The prosecutors further demanded that Mr. Epstein waive his right to 
challenge any of the allegations made by these victims. 
• The Assistant U.S. Attorney involved in this matter recommended for the civil 
attorney, a highly lucrative position, an individual that we later discovered was 
closely and personally connected to the Assistant U.S. Attorney's own boyfriend. 
• Federal prosecutors represented to Mr. Epstein's counsel that they had identified 
(and later rechecked and re-identified) several alleged victims of federal crimes 
that qualified for payment under 18 U.S.C. § 2255, a civil remedy designed to 
provide financial benefits to victims. Only through state discovery provisions did 
we later learn that many of the women on the rechecked victim list could not 
possibly qualify under § 2255. The reason is that they, themselves, testified that 
they did not suffer any type of harm whatsoever, a prerequisite for the civil recovery 
under § 2255. Moreover, these women stated that they did not, now or in the past, 
consider themselves to be victims. 
• During the last few months, Mr. Herman, First Assistant Sloman's former law 
partner, has filed several civil lawsuits against Mr. Epstein on behalf of the alleged 
victims. It is our understanding that each of Mr. Herman's clients are on the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 019229 
Honorable Mark Filip 
May 19, 2008 
Page 7 
Government's confidential list of victims. Most of these lawsuits seek $50 
million in money damages.4 
• Assistant U.S. Attorney David Weinstein spoke about the case in great detail to 
Landon Thomas, a reporter with the New York Times, and revealed confidential 
information about the Government's allegations against Mr. Epstein. The Assistant 
U.S. Attorney also revealed the substance of confidential plea negotiations. 
• When counsel for Mr. Epstein complained about the media leaks, First Assistant 
Sloman responded by asserting that Mr. Thomas was given, pursuant to his 
request, non-case specific information concerning specific federal statutes. Based 
on Mr. Thomas' contemporaneous notes, that assertion appears to be false. For 
example, Mr. Weinstein told Mr. Thomas that federal authorities believed that 
Mr. Epstein had lured girls over the telephone and traveled in interstate commerce 
for the purpose of engaging in underage sex. He recounted to Mr. Thomas the 
USAO's theory of prosecution against Mr. Epstein, replete with an analysis of the 
key statutes being considered. Furthermore, after Mr. Epstein's defense team 
complained about the leak to the USAO, Mr. Weinstein, in Mr. Thomas' own 
description, then admonished him for talking to the defense, and getting him in 
trouble. Mr. Weinstein further told him not to believe the spin of Mr. Epstein's 
high-priced attorneys, and then, according to Mr. Thomas, Mr. Weinstein 
forcefully reminded Mr. Thomas that all prior conversations were merely 
hypothetical. 
We are constrained to conclude that the actions of federal officials in this case strike at 
the heart of one of the vitally important, enduring values in this country: the honest enforcement 
of federal law, free of political considerations and free of the taint of personal financial 
motivations on the part of federal prosecutors that, at a minimum, raise the appearance of serious 
impropriety. 
We were told by U.S. Attorney Acosta that as part of the review he requested, the 
Department had the authority, and his consent, to make any determination it deemed appropriate 
regarding this matter, including a decision to decline federal prosecution. Yet, CEOS's only 
conclusion, based on its limited review of the investigation, is that U.S. Attorney Acosta would 
not abuse his discretion by proceeding against Mr. Epstein. Thus, the decision of whether 
As recently as two months ago, Mr. Sloman was still listed publicly as a part of his former law firm. While we 
assume this was an oversight, Mr. Sloman's identification as part of the firm raises the appearance of 
impropriety.

prosecution is fair and appropriate has been placed, once again, in U.S. Attorney Acosta's

In light of the foregoing, we respectfully ask that you review this matter and discontinue 
all federal involvement so that the State can appropriately bring this matter to closure. We 
would greatly appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to discuss these important issues. 
Such a meeting would provide the Department with an opportunity to review the paramount

Jane (receiver): Hello?

John (caller): Hi, is this Jane?

Jane: This is Jane.

John: Hi, Jane, it’s John.

Jane: Oh, hi, John. How are you? (or) Oh, hi, John. What’s going on?

John will now digress and lead you into a conversation about nothing, from which you will have to
recover and then fish out the ultimate purpose of the call. There is a better approach:

Jane: This is Jane speaking.
John: Hi, it’s John.
Jane: Hi, John. I’m right in the middle of something. How can I help you out?

Potential continuation:

John: Oh, I can call back.

Jane: No, I have a minute. What can I do for you?

Don’t encourage people to chitchat and don’t let them chitchat. Get them to the point immediately. If
they meander or try to postpone for a later undefined call, reel them in and get them to come to the point.
If they go into a long description of a problem, cut in with, “[Name], sorry to interrupt, but I have a call
in five minutes. What can I do to help out?” You might instead say, “[Name], sorry to interrupt, but I
have a call in five minutes. Can you send me an e-mail?”

The third step is to master the art of refusal and avoiding meetings.

THE FIRST DAY our new Sales VP arrived at TrueSAN in 2001, he came into the all-company meeting
and made an announcement in just about this many words: “I am not here to make friends. I have been
hired to build a sales team and sell product, and that’s what I intend to do. Thanks.” So much for small
talk.

He proceeded to deliver on his promise. The office socializers disliked him for his no-nonsense
approach to communication, but everyone respected his time. He wasn’t rude without reason, but he was
direct and kept the people around him focused. Some didn’t consider him charismatic, but no one
considered him anything less than spectacularly effective.

I remember sitting down in his office for our first one-on-one meeting. Fresh off four years of
rigorous academic training, I immediately jumped into explaining the prospect profiles, elaborate
planning I’'d developed, responses to date, and so forth and so on. I had spent at least two hours
preparing to make this first impression a good one. He listened with a smile on his face for no more than
two minutes and then held up a hand. I stopped. He laughed in a kind-hearted manner and said, “Tim, I
don’t want the story. Just tell me what we need to do.”

Over the following weeks, he trained me to recognize when I was unfocused or focused on the wrong
things, which meant anything that didn’t move the top two or three clients one step closer to signing a

1. Defendant Epstein has a sexual preference for young children. Deposition of 
Jeffrey Epstein, Mar. 17, 2010, at 110 (hereinafter Epstein Depo.) (Deposition Attachment 
#1).1 
When questioned about this subject at his deposition, Epstein invoked his Fifth Amendment right to 
remain silent rather than make an incriminating admission. Accordingly, Edwards is entitled to the 
adverse inference against Epstein that, had Epstein answered, the answer would have been unfavorable to 
him. [I]t is well-settled that the Fifth Amendment does not forbid adverse inferences against parties to 
2. Epstein repeatedly sexually assaulted more than forty (40) young girls on 
numerous occasions between 2002 and 2005 in his mansion in West Palm Beach, Florida. These 
sexual assaults included vaginal penetration. Epstein abused many of the girls dozens if not 
hundreds of times. Epstein Depo. at 109 (Q: How many times have you engaged in oral sex 
with females under the age of 18? A: [Invocation of the Fifth Amendment]); Deposition of Jane 
Doe, September 24, 2009 and continued March 11, 2010, at 527 (minor girl sexually abused at 
least 17 times by Epstein) (hereinafter Jane Doe Depo) (Deposition Attachment #2); id. 564-67 
(vaginal penetration by Epstein with his finger), 568 (vaginal penetration by Epstein with a 
massager); Deposition of L.M., September 24, 2009, at 73 (hereinafter L.M. Depo) 
(Deposition Attachment #3) (describing the manner in which Epstein abused her beginning when 
LM was 13 years old, touching her vagina with his fingers and vibrator) at 74, line 12-13 (she 
was personally molested by Epstein more than 50 times), at 164, line 19-23 and 141, line 12-13 
and 605, line 3-6 (describing that in addition to being personally molested by Epstein she was 
paid $200 per underage girl she brought Epstein and she brought him more than seventy (70) 
underage girls - she told him that she did not want to bring him any more girls and he insisted 
that she continue to bring him underage girls); Deposition of E.W., May 6, 2010 (hereinafter 
E.W. Depo) (Deposition Attachment #4) at 115-116, 131 and 255 (describing Epstein's abuse 
of her beginning at age 14 when he paid her for touching her vagina, inserting his fingers and 
civil actions when they refuse to testify in response to probative evidence offered against them. Baxter 
v. Paltnigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 318 (1976); accord Vasquez v. State, 777 So.2d 1200, 1203 (Fla. App. 
2001). The reason for this rule is both logical and utilitarian. A party may not trample upon the rights of 
others and then escape the consequences by invoking a constitutional privilege — at least not in a civil 
setting. Fraser v. Security and II1V. Corp., 615 So.2d 841, 842 (Fla. App. 1993).

using a vibrator and he also paid her $200 for each other underage female E.W. brought him to 
molest. She brought him between 20 and 30 underage females); Deposition of Jane Doe #4, date 
(hereinafter Jane Doe #4 Depo) (Deposition Attachment #5) at 32-34, and 136 (she describes 
first being taken to Epstein at 15 years old, Being fingered by him, having him use a vibrator on 
[me], grabbing my nipples, smelling my butt, jerking off in front of me, licking my cut, several 
times.). 
3. At all relevant times Edwards has had a good faith basis to conclude and did 
conclude2 that Epstein was able to access a large number of underage girls through a pyramid 
abuse scheme in which he paid underage victims $200-$300 cash for each other underage victim 
that she brought to him. See Palm Beach Police Incident Report at 87 (hereinafter Incident 
Report) (Exhibit A).3 The Palm Beach Police Incident Report details Epstein's scheme for 
molesting underage females. Among other things, the Incident Report outlines some of the 
experiences of other Epstein victims. When S.G, a 14 year old minor at the time, was brought to 
Epstein's home, she was taken upstairs by a woman she believed to be Epstein's assistant. The 
woman started to fix up the room, putting covers on the massage table and bringing lotions out. 
The assistant then left the room and told S.G. that Epstein would be up in a second. Epstein 
walked over to S.G. and told her to take her clothes off in a stern voice. S.G. states in the report 
she did not know what to do, as she was the only one there. S.G. took off her shirt, leaving her 
bra on. Epstein, then in a towel told her to take off everything. S.G. removed her pants leaving 
2 In support of all assertions concerning the actions Edwards took, what Edwards learned in the course of his 
representation of his clients, Edwards's good faith beliefs and the foundation for those beliefs, see Edwards 
Affidavit and specifically paragraphs 25 and 25 of that Affidavit.

while exhibits attached to this memorandum will be identified alphabetically as exhibits A, B, C, etc.

on her thong panties. Epstein then instructed S.G to give him a massage. As S.G gave Epstein a 
massage, Epstein turned around and masturbated. S.G. was so disgusted, she did not say 
anything; Epstein told her she had a really hot body. Id. at 14. In the report, S.G. admitted 
seeing Jeffrey Epstein's penis and stated she thought Epstein was on steroids because he was a 
really built guy and his wee wee was very tiny. Id. at 15. 
4. The exact number of minor girls who Epstein assaulted is known only to Epstein. 
However, Edwards had a good faith basis to believe and did in fact believe that Epstein's victims 
were substantially more than forty (40) in number. In addition to the deposition excerpts from 
two of his many victims above about the number of underage girls brought to Epstein and the 
Palm Beach incident report, there is overwhelming proof that the number of underage girls 
molested by Epstein through his scheme was in the hundreds. See Complaint, Jane Doe 102 v. 
Epstein, (hereinafter Jane Doe 102 complaint) (Exhibit B); see also Deposition of Jeffrey 
Epstein, April 14, 2010, at 442, 443, and 444 (Epstein invoking the 5th on questions about his 
daily abuse and molestation of children) (Deposition Attachment #6). 
5. At all relevant times Edwards has had a good faith basis to believe and did in fact 
believe that Epstein and his attorneys knew of the seriousness of the criminal investigation 
against him and corresponded constantly with the United States Attorney's Office in an attempt 
to avoid the filing of numerous federal felony offenses, which effort was successful. See 
Correspondence from U.S. Attorney's Office to Epstein (hereinafter U.S. Attorney's 
Correspondence) (Composite Exhibit C) (provided in discovery during the Jane Doe v. Epstein 
case). 
4 
6. At all relevant times Edwards has had a good faith basis to believe and did in fact 
believe that, more specifically, Epstein's attorneys knew of Epstein's scheme to recruit minors for 
sex and also knew that these minors had civil actions that they could bring against him. In fact, 
there was much communication between Epstein's attorneys and the United States Prosecutors in 
a joint attempt to minimize Epstein's civil exposure. For example, on October 3, 2007, Assistant 
U.S. Attorney Marie Villafaila sent an email (attached hereto as Exhibit D) to Jay Leflcowitz, 
counsel for Epstein, with attached proposed letter to special master regarding handling numerous 
expected civil claims against Epstein. The letter reads in pertinent part, 
The undersigned, as counsel for the United States of America and 
Jeffrey Epstein, jointly write to you to provide information relevant to your 
service as a Special Master in the selection of an attorney to represent several 
young women who may have civil damages claims against Mr. Epstein. The 
U.S. Attorney's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (jointly referred 
to as the United States) have conducted an investigation of Jeffrey Epstein 
regarding his solicitation of minor females in Palm Beach County to engage in 
prostitution. Mr. Epstein, through his assistants, would recruit underage 
females to travel to his home in Palm Beach to engage in lewd conduct in 
exchange for money. Based upon the investigation, the United States has 
identified forty (40) young women who can be characterized as victims 
pursuant to 18 USC 2255. Some of those women went to Mr. Epstein's home 
only once, some went there as much as 100 times or more. Some of the 
women's conduct was limited to performing a topless or nude massage while 
Mr. Epstein masturbated himself. For other women, the conduct escalated to 
full sexual intercourse. As part of the resolution of the case, Epstein has 
agreed that he would not contest jurisdiction in the Southern District of Florida 
for any victim who chose to sue him for damages pursuant to 18 USC 2255. 
Mr. Epstein agreed to provide an attorney for victims who elected to proceed 
exclusively pursuant to that section, and agreed to waive any challenge to 
liability under that section up to an amount agreed to by the parties. The parties 
have agreed to submit the selection of an attorney to a Special Master.... 
7. At all relevant times Edwards has had a good faith basis to believe and did in fact 
believe that L.M. was, in fact, a victim of Epstein's criminal abuse because L.M. was one of the 
5 
minor females that the United States Attorney's Office recognized as a victim. L.M. 's sworn 
deposition testimony and the adverse inference drawn from Epstein's refusal to testify confiuiii 
that Epstein began sexually assaulting L.M. when she was 13 years old and continued to molest 
her on more than fifty (50) occasions over three (3) years. Epstein Depo., Attachment #1, at 17 
(Q: Did you . . . ever engage in any sexual conduct with L.M.? A: [Invocation of the Fifth 
Amendment].); see also Epstein Depo., April 14, 2010, Attachment #6, at 456 (Q: LM was an 
underage female that you first abused when she was 13 years old; is that correct? A: [Invocation 
of Fifth Amendment].) 
8. Epstein was also given ample opportunity to explain why he engaged in sexual 
activity with L.M. beginning when L.M. was 13 years old and why he has molested minors on an 
everyday basis for years, and he invoked his 5th amendment right rather than provide 
explanation. See Epstein Deposition, February 17, 2010, at 11-12, 30-31 (Deposition 
Attachment # 7). 
9. Epstein also sexually assaulted E.W., beginning when she was 14 years old and 
did so on numerous occasions. See E.W. Depo., Attachment #4 at 215-216. 
10. Another of the minor girls Epstein sexually assaulted was Jane Doe; the abuse 
began when Jane Doe was 14 years old. Rather than incriminate himself', Epstein invoked the 
5th amendment to questions about him digitally penetrating Doe's vagina, using vibrators on her 
vagina and masturbating and ejaculating in her presence. Epstein Depo., April 14, 2010, 
Attachment #6, at 420, 464, 468. 
11. When Edwards's clients L.M., E.W., and Jane Doe were 13 or 14 years old, each 
was brought to Epstein's home multiple times by another underage victim. Epstein engaged in 
6 
one or more of the following acts with each of the then-minor girls at his mansion: receiving a 
topless or completely nude massage; using a vibrator on her vagina; masturbating in her 
presence; ejaculating in her presence; touching her breast or buttocks or vagina or the clothes 
covering her sexual organs; and demanding that she bring him other underage girls. Epstein and 
his co-conspirators used the telephone to contact these girls to entice or induce them into going 
to his mansion for sexual abuse. Epstein also made E.W. perform oral sex on him and was to 
perfoim sex acts on Nadia Marcinkova (Epstein's live-in sex slave) in Epstein's presence. See 
Plaintiff Jane Doe's Notice Regarding Evidence of Similar Acts of Sexual Assault, filed in Jane 
Doe v. Epstein, No. 08-cv-80893 (S.D. Fla. 2010), as DE 197, (hereinafter Rule 413 Notice) 
(Exhibit E); Jane Doe Depo., Attachment #2, at 379-380; L.M. Depo., Attachment #3, at 416; 
E.W. Depo, Attachment #4, at 205. 
12. At all relevant times Edwards has had a good faith basis to believe and did in fact 
believe that yet another of the minor girls Epstein sexually assaulted was C.L. When she was 
approximately 15 years old, C.L. was brought to Epstein's home by another underage victim. 
While a minor, she was at Epstein's home on multiple occasions. Epstein engaged in one or 
more of the following acts with her while she was a minor at his house - topless or completely 
nude massage on Epstein; Epstein used a vibrator on her vagina; Epstein masturbated in her 
presence; Epstein ejaculated in her presence; Epstein also demanded that she bring him other 
underage girls. See Rule 413 Notice, Exhibit E; Incident Report, Exhibit A. 
13. At all relevant times Edwards has had a good faith basis to believe and did in fact 
believe that yet another girl Epstein sexually assault was A.H. When she was approximately 16 
years old, she was brought to Epstein's home by another underage victim. While a minor, she 
7 
was at Epstein's home on multiple occasions. Epstein engaged in one or more of the following 
acts with her while she was a minor at his house - topless or completely nude massage on 
Epstein; Epstein used a vibrator on her vagina; Epstein masturbated in her presence; Epstein 
ejaculated in her presence; Epstein touched her breast or buttock or vagina or the clothes 
covering her sexual organs; was made to perform sex acts on Epstein; made to perfoim sex acts 
on Nadia Marcinkova in Epstein's presence. Epstein also forcibly raped this underage victim, as 
he held her head down against her will and pumped his penis inside her while she was screaming 
No. See Rule 413 Notice, Exhibit E; Incident Report, Exhibit A, at 41 (specifically 
discussing the rape): 
[A.H.] remembered that she climaxed and was removing herself from the 
massage table. [A.H.] asked for a sheet of paper and drew the massage table in the 
master bathroom and where Epstein, Marcinkova and she were. Epstein turned 
[A.H.] on to her stomach on the massage bed and inserted his penis into her 
vagina. [A.H.] stated Epstein began to pump his penis in her vagina. [A.H.] 
became upset over this. She said her head was being held against the bed forcibly, 
as he continued to pump inside her. She screamed no, and Epstein stopped .... 
[A.H.] advised there were times that she was so sore when she left Epstein's 
house. [A.H.] advised she was ripped, torn, in her vagina area. [A.H.] advised she 
had difficulty walking to the car after leaving the house because she was so sore. 
14. Without detailing each fact known about Epstein's abuse of the many underage 
girls, Edwards has had a good faith basis to believe and did in fact believe at all relevant times 
that Epstein also abused other victims in ways closely similar to those described in the preceding 
paragraphs. Epstein's additional victims include the following (among many other) young girls: 
S.G.; A.D.; V.A.; N.R.; J.S.; V.Z.; J.A.; F.E.; M.L.; M.D.; D.D.; and D.N. These girls were 
between the ages of 13 and 17 when Epstein abused them. See Rule 413 Notice, Exhibit E; 
Deposition of E.W., Deposition Attachment #4.

15. One of Mr. Epstein's household employees, Mr. Alfredo Rodriguez, saw 
numerous underage girls coming into Epstein's mansion for purported massages. See 
Rodriguez Depo. at 242-44 (Deposition Attachment #8). Rodriguez was aware that sex toys 
and vibrators were found in Epstein's bedroom after the purported massages. Id. at 223-28. 
Rodriguez thought what Epstein was doing was wrong, given the extreme youth of the girls he 
saw. Id. at 230-31. 
16. Alfredo Rodriguez took a journal from Epstein's computer that reflected many of 
the names of underage females Epstein abused across the country and the world, including 
locations such as Michigan, California, West Palm Beach, New York, New Mexico, and Paris, 
France. See Journal (hereinafter The Journal or Holy Grail) (Exhibit F) (identifying, 
among other Epstein acquaintances, females that Rodriguez believes were underage under the 
heading labeled Massages). 
17. Rodriguez was later charged in a criminal complaint with obstruction of justice in 
connection with trying to obtain $50,000 from civil attorneys pursuing civil sexual assault cases 
against Epstein as payment for producing the book to the attorneys. See Criminal Complaint at 
2, U.S. v. Rodriguez, No. 9:10-CR-80015-KAM (S.D. Fla. 2010) (Exhibit G). Rodriguez 
stated he needed money because the journal was his property and that he was afraid that 
Jeffrey Epstein would make him disappear unless he had an insurance policy (i.e., the 
journal). Id. at 3. Because of the importance of the information in the journal to the civil cases, 
Mr. Rodriguez called it The Holy Grail. 
18. In the Holy Grail or The Journal, among the many names listed (along with 
the abused girls) are some of the people that Epstein alleges in his Complaint had no connection 
9 
whatsoever with the litigation in this case. See, e.g., Journal, Exhibit F, at 85 (Donald Trump); 
at 9 (Bill Clinton phone numbers listed under Doug Bands). 
Federal Investigation and Plea Agreement With Epstein  
19. In approximately 2005, the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern 
District of Florida learned of Epstein's repeated sexual abuse of minor girls. They began a 
criminal investigation into federal offenses related to his crimes. See U.S. Attorney's 
Correspondence, Exhibit C. 
20. At all relevant times Edwards has had a good faith basis to believe and did in fact 
believe that to avoid the Government learning about his abuse of minor girls, Epstein threatened 
his employees and demanded that they not cooperate with the government. Epstein's aggressive 
witness tampering was so severe that the United States Attorney's Office prepared negotiated 
plea agreements containing these charges. For example, in a September 18, 2007, email from 
AUSA Villafacia to Lefkowitz (attached hereto as Exhibit H), she attached the proposed plea 
agreement describing Epstein's witness tampering as follows: 
UNITED STATES vs. JEFFREY EPSTEIN PLEA PROFFER 
On August 21, 2007, FBI Special Agents E. Nesbitt Kuyrkendall and Jason 
Richards traveled to the home of Leslie Groff to serve her with a federal grand 
jury subpoena with an investigation pending in the Southern District of Florida. 
Ms. Groff works as the personal assistant of the defendant. Ms. Groff began 
speaking with the agents and then excused herself to go upstairs to check on her 
sleeping child. While upstairs, Ms. Groff telephoned the defendant, Jeffrey 
Epstein, and informed him that the FBI agents were at her home. Mr. Epstein 
instructed Ms. Groff not to speak with the agents and reprimanded her for 
allowing them into her home. Mr. Epstein applied pressure to keep Ms. Groff 
from complying with the grand jury subpoenas that the agents had served upon 
her. In particular, Mr. Epstein warned Ms. Groff against turning over documents 
and electronic evidence responsive to the subpoena and pressured her to delay her 
10 
appearance before the grand jury in the Southern District of Florida. This 
conversation occurred when Mr. Epstein was aboard his privately owned civilian 
aircraft in Miami in the Southern District of Florida. His pilot had filed a flight 
plan showing the parties were about to return to Teterboro, NJ. After the 
conversation with Ms. Groff, Mr. Epstein became concerned that the FBI would 
try to serve his traveling companion, Nadia Marcinkova, with a similar grand jury 
subpoena. In fact, the agents were preparing to serve Ms. Marcinkova with a 
target letter when the flight landed in Teterboro. Mr. Epstein then redirected his 
airplane, making the pilot file a new flight plan to travel to the US Virgin Islands 
instead of the New York City area, thereby keeping the Special Agents from 
serving the target letter on Nadia Marcinkova. During the flight, the defendant 
verbally harassed Ms. Marcinkova, harassing and pressuring her not to cooperate 
with the grand jury's investigation, thereby hindering and dissuading her from 
reporting the commission of a violation of federal law to a law enforcement 
officer, namely, Special Agents of the FBI. Epstein also threatened and harassed 
Sarah Kellen against cooperating against him as well. 
21. Edwards learned that the Palm Beach police department investigation ultimately 
led to the execution of a search warrant at Epstein's mansion in October 2005. See Police 
Incident Report, Exhibit A. 
22. Edwards learned that at around the same time, the Palm Beach Police Department 
also began investigating Epstein's sexual abuse of minor girls. They also collected evidence of 
Epstein's involvement with minor girls and his obsession with training sex slaves, including 
pulling information from Epstein's trash. Their investigation showed that Epstein ordered from 
Arnazon.com on about September 4, 2005, such books as: SM101: A Realistic Introduction, by 
Jay Wiseman; SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for Erotic Servitude - Principles, Skills, and Tools, by Guy 
Baldwin; and Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and Their Owners, 
by Christina Abernathy. See Receipt for Sex Slave Books (Exhibit I). 
23. The Palm Beach incident reports provided Edwards with the names of numerous 
witnesses that participated in Epstein's child molestation criminal enterprise and also provided 
11 
Edwards with some insight into how far-reaching Epstein's power was and how addicted Epstein 
was to sex with children. See Incident Report, Exhibit A. 
24. The Palm Beach Police Department also collected Epstein's message pads, which 
provided other names of people that also knew Epstein's scheme to molest children. See 
Message Pads (Exhibit J) (note: the names of underage females have been redacted to protect 
the anonymity of the underage sex abuse victims). Those message pads show clear indication 
that Epstein's staff was frequently working to schedule multiple young girls between the ages of 
12 and 16 years old literally every day, often two or three times per day. Id. 
25. In light of all of the infatuation of numerous crimes committed by Epstein, 
Edwards learned that the U.S. Attorney's Office began preparing the filing of federal criminal 
charges against Epstein. For example, in addition to the witness tampering and money 
laundering charges the U.S. Attorney's Office prepared an 82-page prosecution memo and a 53-
page indictment of Epstein related to his sexual abuse of children. On September 19, 2007, at 
12:14 PM, AUSA Villafafia wrote to Epstein's counsel, Jay Lefkowitz, Jay - I hate to have to be 
firm about this, but we need to wrap this up by Monday. I will not miss my indictment date 
when this has dragged on for several weeks already and then, if things fall apart, be left in a less 
advantageous position than before the negotiations. I have had an 82-page pros memo and 53-
page indictment sitting on the shelf since May to engage in these negotiations. There has to be 
an ending date, and that date is Monday. These and other communications are within the 
correspondence attached as Composite Exhibit C. 
26. Edwards learned that rather than face the filing of federal felony criminal charges, 
Epstein (through his attorneys) engaged in plea bargain discussions. As a result of those 
12 
discussions, on September 24, 2007, Epstein signed an agreement with the U.S. Attorney's 
Office for the Southern District of Florida. Under the agreement, Epstein agreed to plead guilty 
to an indictment pending against him in the 15th Judicial Circuit in and for Palm Beach County 
charging him with solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors for prostitution. 
Epstein also agreed that he would receive a thirty month sentence, including 18 months of jail 
time and 12 months of community control. In exchange, the U.S. Attorney's Office agreed not to 
pursue any federal charges against Epstein. See Non-Prosecution Agreement (Exhibit K). 
27. Part of the Non-Prosecution Agreement that Epstein negotiated was a provision in 
which the federal government agreed not to prosecute Epstein's co-conspirators. The co-
conspirators procured minor females to be molested by Epstein. One of the co-conspirators - 
Nadia Marcinkova -even participated in the sex acts with minors (including E.W.) and Epstein. 
See Incident Report, Exhibit A, at 40-42, 49-51; Deposition of Nadia Marcinkova, April 13, 
2010, (hereinafter Marcinkova Depo.) at 11 (Deposition attachment #9). 
28. Under the Non-Prosecution Agreement, Epstein was to use his best efforts to 
enter into his guilty pleas by October 26, 2007. However, Edwards learned that Epstein violated 
his agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office to do so and delayed entry of his plea. See Letter 
from U.S. Attorney R. Alexander Acosta to Lilly Ann Sanchez, Dec. 19, 2007 (Exhibit L). 
29. On January 10, 2008 and again on May 30, 2008 E.W. and L.M. received letters 
from the FBI advising them that [t]his case is currently under investigation. This can be a 
lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough 
investigation. Letters attached at Composite Exhibit M. This document is evidence that the 
FBI did not notify E.W. and L.M. that a plea agreement had already been reached that would 
13 
block federal prosecution of Epstein. Nor did the FBI notify E.W. and L.M. of any of the parts of 
the plea agreement. Nor did the FBI or other federal authorities confer with E.W. and L.M. 
about the plea. See id. 
30. In 2008, Edwards believed in good faith that criminal prosecution of Epstein was 
extremely important to his clients E.W. and L.M. and that they desired to be consulted by the 
FBI and/or other representatives of the federal government about the prosecution of Epstein. 
The letters that they had received around January 10, 2008, suggested that a criminal 
investigation of Epstein was on-going and that they would be contacted before the federal 
government reached any final resolution of that investigation. See id. 
Edwards Agrees to Serve as Legal Counsel for Three Victims of Epstein 's Sexual 
Assaults 
31. In about April 2008, Bradley J. Edwards, Esq., was a licensed attorney in Florida, 
practicing as a sole practitioner. As a fornler prosecutor, he was well versed in civil cases that 
involved criminal acts, including sexual assaults. Three of the many girls Epstein had abused — 
L.M., E.W., and Jane Doe — all requested that Edwards represent them civilly and secure 
appropriate monetary damages against Epstein for repeated acts of sexual abuse while they were 
minor girls. Two of the girls (L.M. and E.W.) also requested that Edwards represent them in 
connection with a concern that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and U.S. Attorney's 
Office might be arranging a plea bargain for the criminal offenses committed by Epstein without 
providing them the legal rights to which they were entitled (including the right to be notified of 
plea discussions and the right to confer with prosecutors about any plea arrangement). See 
14 
Affidavit of Bradley J. Edwards, Esq. at ¶1 - 2, ¶4 (hereinafter Edwards Affidavit) (Exhibit 
32. On June 13, 2008, attorney Edwards agreed to represent E.W.; on July 2, 2008, 
attorney Edwards agreed to represent Jane Doe; and, on July 7, 2008, attorney Edwards agreed to 
represent L.M. in connection with the sexual assaults committed by Epstein and to insure that 
their rights as victims of crimes were protected in the criminal process on-going against Epstein. 
Mr. Edwards and his three clients executed written retention agreements. See id. at ¶2. 
33. In mid June of 2008, Edwards contacted AUSA Villafeia to infoiin her that he 
represented Jane Doe #1 and, later, Jane Doe #2. AUSA Villafalia did not advise that a plea 
agreement had already been negotiated with Epstein's attorneys that would block federal 
prosecution. To the contrary, AUSA Villafalia mentioned a possible indictment. AUSA 
Villafafia did indicate that federal investigators had concrete evidence and infoimation that 
Epstein had sexually molested many underage minor females, including E.W., LM, and Jane 
Doe. See id. at ¶4. 
34. Edwards also requested from the U.S. Attorney's Office the infoimation that they 
had collected regarding Epstein's sexual abuse of his clients. However, the U.S. Attorney's 
Office, declined to provide any such infoiniation to Edwards. It similarly declined to provide 
any such information to the other attorneys who represented victims of Epstein's sexual assaults. 
At the very least, this includes the items that were confiscated in the search warrant of Epstein's 
home, including dildos, vibrators, massage table, oils, and additional message pads. See 
Property Receipt (Exhibit 0). 
15 
35. On Friday, June 27, 2008, at approximately 4:15 p.m., AUSA Villafaiia received a 
copy of Epstein's proposed state plea agreement and learned that the plea was scheduled for 8:30 
a.m., Monday, June 30, 2008. AUSA Villafalia called Edwards to provide notice to his clients 
regarding the hearing. AUSA Villafafia did not tell Attorney Edwards that the guilty pleas in 
state court would bring an end to the possibility of federal prosecution pursuant to the plea 
agreement. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit N, at ¶6. 
36. Under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771, victims of 
federal crimes — including E.W. and L.M. — are entitled to basic rights during any plea 
bargaining process, including the right to be treated with fairness, the right to confer with 
prosecutors regarding any plea, and the right to be heard regarding any plea. The process that 
was followed leading to the non-prosecution of Epstein violated these rights of E.W. and L.M. 
See Emergency Petn. for Victim's Enforcement of Crime Victim's Rights, No. 9:08-CV-80736-
KAM (S.D. Fla. 2008) (Exhibit P). 
37. Because of the violation of the CVRA, on July 7, 2008, Edwards filed an action in 
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Case No. 9:08-CV-80736, seeking to 
enforce the rights of E.W. and L.M. That action alleged that the U.S. Attorney's Office had 
failed to provide E.W. and L.M. the rights to which they were entitled under the Act, including 
the right to be notified about a plea agreement and to confer with prosecutors regarding it. See 
Id. 
38. On July 11, 2008, Edwards took E.W. and L.M. with him to the hearing on the 
CVRA action. It was only at this hearing that both victims learned for the first time that the plea 
deal was already done with Epstein and that the criminal case against Epstein had been 
16 
effectively terminated by the U.S. Attorney's office. See Hearing Transcript, July 11, 2008 
(Exhibit Q). 
39. Edwards learned that Jane Doe felt so strongly that the plea bargain was 
inappropriate that she made her own determination to appear on a television program and 
exercise her First Amendment rights to criticize the unduly lenient plea bargain Epstein received 
in a criminal case. 
40. The CVRA action that Edwards filed was recently administratively closed and 
Edwards filed a Motion to reopen that proceeding. See No. 9:08-CV-80736 (S.D. Fla.). 
Epstein 's Entry of Guilty Pleas to Sex Offenses 
41. Ultimately, on June 30, 2008, in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit in Palm Beach 
County, Florida, defendant Epstein, entered pleas of guilty to various Florida state crimes 
involving the solicitation of minors for prostitution and the procurement of minors for the 
purposes of prostitution. See Plea Colloquy (Exhibit R). 
42. As a condition of that plea, and in exchange for the Federal Government not 
prosecuting the Defendant, Epstein additionally entered into an agreement with the Federal 
Government acknowledging that approximately thirty-four (34) other young girls could receive 
payments from him under the federal statute providing for compensation to victims of child 
sexual abuse, 18 U.S.C. § 2255. As had been agreed months before, the U.S. Attorney's Office 
did not prosecute Epstein federally for his sexual abuse of these minor girls. See Addendum to 
Non-Prosecution Agreement (Exhibit 5) (in redacted form to protect the identities of the 
minors involved). 
17 
43. Because Epstein became a convicted sex offender, he was not to have contact 
with any of his victims. During the course of his guilty pleas on June 30, 2008, Palm Beach 
Circuit Court Judge Deborah Dale Pucillo ordered Epstein not to have any contact, direct or 
indirect with any victims. She also expressly stated that her no-contact order applied to all of 
the victims. Similar orders were entered by the federal court handling some of the civil cases 
against Epstein. The federal court stated that it finds it necessary to state clearly that Defendant 
is under this court's order not to have direct or indirect contact with any plaintiffs . . . . Order, 
Case No. 9:08-cv-80119 (S.D. Fla. 2008), [DE 238] at 4-5 (emphasis added); see also Order, 
Case No. 9:08-cv-80893, [DE 193] at 2 (emphasis added). 
Edwards Files Civil Suits Against Epstein  
44. Edwards had a good faith belief that his clients felt angry and betrayed by the 
criminal system and wished to prosecute and punish Epstein for his crimes against them in 
whatever avenue remained open to them. On August 12, 2008, at the request of his client Jane 
Doe, Brad Edwards filed a civil suit against Jeffrey Epstein to recover damages for his sexual 
assault of Jane Doe. See Edwards Affidavit, N at 17. Included in this complaint was a RICO 
count that explained how Epstein ran a criminal conspiracy to procure young girls for him to 
sexually abuse. See Complaint, Jane Doe v. Epstein (Exhibit T). 
45. On September 11, 2008, at the request of his client E.W., Brad Edwards filed a civil 
suit against Jeffrey Epstein to recover damages for his sexual assault of E.W. See Complaint, 
E.W. v. Epstein (Exhibit U). 
18 
46. On September 11, 2008, at the request of his client L.M.., Brad Edwards filed a civil 
suit against Jeffrey Epstein to recover damages for his sexual assault of L.M. See Complaint, 
L.M. v. Epstein, (Exhibit V). 
47. Jane Doe's federal complaint indicated that she sought damages of more than 
$50,000,000. Listing the amount of damages sought in the complaint was in accord with other 
civil suits that were filed against Epstein (before any lawsuit filed by Edwards). See Complaint, 
Jane Doe #4 v. Epstein (Exhibit W) (filed by Herman and Mermelstein, PA). 
48. At about the same time as Edwards filed his three lawsuits against Epstein, other 
civil attorneys were filing similar lawsuits against Epstein. For example, on or about April 14, 
2008 another law firm, Herman and Mellnelstein, filed the first civil action against Epstein on 
behalf of one of its seven clients who were molested by Epstein. The complaints that attorney 
Herman filed on behalf of his seven clients were similar in tenor and tone to the complaint that 
Edwards filed on behalf of his three clients. See id. 
49. Over the next year and a half, more than 20 other similar civil actions were filed by 
various attorneys against Epstein alleging sexual assault of minor girls. These complaints were 
also similar in tenor and tone to the complaint that Edwards filed on behalf of his clients. These 
complaints are all public record and have not been attached, but are available in this Court's files 
and the files of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. 
50. In addition to the complaints filed against Epstein in Florida, a female in New York, 
Ava Cordero, filed a lawsuit against Epstein in New York making similar allegations - that 
Epstein paid her for a massage then forced her to give him oral sex and molested her in other 
ways when she was only 16 years old. Cordero was born a male, and in her complaint she 
19 
alleges that Epstein told her during the massage, I love how young you are. You have a tight 
butt like a baby. See Jeff Epstein Sued for Repeated Sexual Assaults on Teen, New York 
Post, October 17, 2007, by Dareh Gregorian, link at: 
http://www.nypost.com/p/news/regional/item_44z1WyLUFH7R1OUtKYGPbPj se s si onid=6CA3  
EBF1BEF68F5DE14BFB2CAA5C37E0. See Article attached hereto as Exhibit X. 
51. Edwards's three complaints against Epstein contained less detail about sexual 
abuse than (as one example) a complaint filed by attorney Robert Josephsberg from the law firm 
of Podhurst Orseck. See Complaint, Jane Doe 102 v. Epstein (Exhibit B). As recounted in 
detail in this Complaint, Jane Doe 102 was 15 years old when Ghislaine Maxwell discovered her 
and lured her to Epstein's house. Maxwell and Epstein forced her to have sex with both of them 
and within weeks Maxwell and Epstein were flying her all over the world. According to the 
Complaint, Jane Doe 102 was forced to live as one of Epstein's underage sex slaves for years 
and was forced to have sex with not only Maxwell and Epstein but also other politicians, 
businessmen, royalty, academicians, etc. She was even made to watch Epstein have sex with 
three 12-year-old French girls that were sent to him for his birthday by a French citizen that is a 
friend of Epstein's. Luckily, Jane Doe 102 escaped to Australia to get away from Epstein and 
Maxwell's sexual abuse. 
52. Edwards learned that in addition to civil suits that were filed in court against 
Epstein, at around the same time other attorneys engaged in pre-filing settlement discussions 
with Epstein. Rather than face filed civil suits in these cases, Epstein paid money settlements to 
more than 15 other women who had sexually abused while they were minors. See articles 
regarding settlements attached hereto as Composite Exhibit Y. 
20 
Epstein's Obstruction of Normal Discovery and Attacks on His Victims 
53. Once Edwards filed his civil complaints for his three clients, he began the normal 
process of discovery for cases such as these. He sent standard discovery requests to Epstein 
about his sexual abuse of the minor girls, including requests for admissions, request for 
production, and interrogatories. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit N, at Till 1-19 and 25. 
Rather than answer any substantive questions about his sexual abuse and his conspiracy for 
procuring minor girls for him to abuse, Epstein invoked his 5th amendment right against self-
incrimination. An example of Epstein's refusal to answer is attached as Composite Exhibit Z 
(original discovery propounded to Epstein and his responses invoking 5th amendment). 
54. During the discovery phase of the civil cases filed against Epstein, Epstein's 
deposition was taken at least five times. During all of those depositions, Epstein refused to 
answer any substantive questions about his sexual abuse of minor girls. See, e.g., Deposition 
Attachments 1, 6 and 7. 
55. During these depositions, Epstein further attempted to obstruct legitimate 
questioning by inserting a variety of irrelevant infatuation about his case. As one of 
innumerable examples, on March 8, 2010, Mr. Horowitz, representing seven victims, Jane Doe's 
2-8, asked, Q: In 2004, did you rub Jane Doe 3's vagina? A: Excuse me. I'd like to answer that 
question, as I would like to answer mostly every question you've asked me here today; however, 
upon advice of counsel, I cannot answer that question. They've advised me I must assert my 
Sixth Amendment, Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment Rights against self--excuse 
me, against--under the Constitution. And though your partner, Jeffrey Heiman, was disbarred 
after filing this lawsuit [a statement that was untrue], Mr. Edwards' partner sits in jail for 
21 
fabricating cases of a sexual nature fleecing unsuspecting Florida investors and others out of 
millions of dollars for cases of a sexual nature with--I'd like to answer your questions; however if 
I--I'm told that if I do so, I risk losing my counsel's representation; therefore I must accept their 
advice. Epstein deposition, March 8, 2010, at 106 (Deposition attachment #10). 
56. When Edwards had the opportunity to take Epstein's deposition, he only asked 
reasonable questions, all of which related to the merits of the cases against Epstein. All 
depositions of Epstein in which Mr. Edwards participated on behalf of his clients are attached to 
this motion. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit N at 111 and Deposition attachments #1, 6, 7, 10, 
11, 12, and 13. Cf. with Deposition of Epstein taken by an attorney representing BB (one in 
which Edwards was not participating), http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-dqoEyYXx4; and 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCNiY1tW-r0  
57. Edwards's efforts to obtain infoimation about Epstein's organization for 
procuring young girls was also blocked because Epstein's co-conspirators took the Fifth. 
Deposition of Sarah Kellen, March 24, 2010 (hereinafter Kellen Depo.) (Deposition 
attachment #14); Deposition of Nadia Marcinkova, April 13, 2010, (Deposition attachment #9); 
Deposition of Adriana Mucinska Ross, March 15, 2010 (hereinafter Ross Depo.) (Deposition 
attachment #15). Each of these co-conspirators invoked their respective rights against self-
incrimination as to all relevant questions, and the depositions have been attached. 
58. At all relevant times Edwards has had a good faith basis to believe and did in fact 
believe Sarah Kellen was an employee of Epstein's and had been identified as a defendant in at 
least one of the complaints against Epstein for her role in bringing girls to Epstein's mansion to 
be abused. At the deposition, she was represented by Bruce Reinhart. She invoked the Fifth on 
22 
all substantive questions regarding her role in arranging for minor girls to come to Epstein's 
mansion to be sexually abused. Reinhart had previously been an Assistant United States 
Attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida when Epstein was 
being investigated criminally by Reinhart's office. Reinhart left the United States Attorney's 
Office and was immediately hired by Epstein to represent Epstein's pilots and certain co-
conspirators during the civil cases against Epstein. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit N at ¶11. 
59. Edwards also had other lines of legitimate discovery blocked through the efforts 
of Epstein and others. For example, Edwards learned through deposition that Ghislaine Maxwell 
was involved in managing Epstein's affairs and companies. See deposition of Epstein's house 
manager Janusz Banziak, February 16, 2010 at page 14, lines 20-23 (Deposition Attachment 
#16); See deposition of Epstein's housekeeper Louella Rabuyo, October 20, 2009, page 9, lines 
17-25 (Deposition Attachment #17); See deposition of Epstein's pilot Larry Eugene Morrison, 
October 6, 2009, page 102-103 (Deposition Attachment #18); See deposition of Alfredo 
Rodriguez, August 7, 2009, page 302-306 and 348 (Deposition Attachment #8); See also Prince 
Andrew's Friend, Ghislaine Maxwell, Some Underage Girls and A Very Disturbing Story, 
September 23, 2007 by Wendy Leigh, link at 
http://www.redicecreations.com/article.php?id=18950HANNA SJOBERG. Exhibit AA. 
60. Alfredo Rodriguez testified that Maxwell took photos of girls without the girls' 
knowledge, kept the images on her computer, knew the names of the underage girls and their 
respective phone numbers and other underage victims were molested by Epstein and Maxwell 
together. See Deposition of Rodriguez, Deposition attachment # 8 at 64, 169-170 and 236. 
23 
61. In reasonable reliance on this and other infoimation, Edwards served Maxwell for 
deposition in 2009. See Deposition Notice attached as Exhibit BB. Maxwell was represented 
by Brett Jaffe of the New York firm of Cohen and Gresser, and Edwards understood that her 
attorney was paid for (directly or indirectly) by Epstein. She was reluctant to give her 
deposition, and Edwards tried to work with her attorney to take her deposition on teims that 
would be acceptable to both sides. The result was the attached confidentiality agreement, under 
which Maxwell agreed to drop any objections to the deposition, attached hereto as Exhibit CC. 
Maxwell, however, contrived to avoid the deposition. On June 29, 2010, one day before 
Edwards was to fly to NY to take Maxwell's deposition, her attorney informed Edwards that 
Maxwell's mother was deathly ill and Maxwell was consequently flying to England with no 
intention of returning to the United States. Despite that assertion, Ghislaine Maxwell was in fact 
in the country on July 31, 2010, as she attended the wedding of Chelsea Clinton (former 
President Clinton's daughter) and was captured in a photograph taken for OK magazine. Photos 
from Issue 809 of the publication See US Weekly dated August 16, 2010 are attached hereto as 
Exhibit DD and Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit N at ¶12. 
62. Maxwell is not the only important witness to lie to avoid deposition by Edwards. 
Upon review of the message pads that were taken from Epstein's home in the police trash pulls, 
see Exhibit J supra, many were from Jean Luc Brunel, a French citizen and one of Epstein's 
closest pals. He left messages for Epstein. One dated 4/1/05 said, He has a teacher for you to 
teach you how to speak Russian. She is 2x8 years old, not blonde. Lessons are free and you can 
have your 1st today if you call. See Messages taken from Jean Luc Brunel are attached hereto as 
Exhibit EE. In light of these circumstances of the case, this message reasonably suggested to 
24 
Edwards that Brunel might have been procuring two eight-year-old girls for Epstein to sexually 
abuse. According to widely circulated press reports reviewed by Edwards, Brunel is in his 
sixties and has a reputation throughout the world (and especially in the modeling industry) as a 
cocaine addict that has for years molested children through modeling agencies while acting as 
their agent — conduct that has been the subject of critical reports, books, several news articles, 
and a 60 Minutes documentary on Brunel's sexual exploitation of underage models. See 
http://bradmillershero.blogspot.com/2010/08/women-are-objects.html, attached hereto as Exhibit 
63. Edwards learned that Brunel is also someone that visited Epstein on 
approximately 67 occasions while Epstein was in jail. See Epstein's jail visitor log attached as 
Exhibit GG. 
64. Edwards learned that Brunel currently runs the modeling agency MC2, a company 
for which Epstein provides financial support. See Message Pad's attached as Exhibit J supra 
and Sworn Statement of MC2 employee Maritza Vasquez, June 15, 2010, Maritza Vasquez 
Sworn Statement attached at Exhibit HH at 1-16. 
65. Employees of MC2 told Edwards that Epstein's numerous condos at 301 East 66 
Street in New York were used to house young models. Edwards was told that MC2 modeling 
agency, affiliated with Epstein and Brunel brought underage girls from all over the world, 
promising them modeling contracts. Epstein and Brunel would then obtain a visa for these girls, 
then would charge the underage girls rent, presumably to live as underage prostitutes in the 
condos. See Maritza Vasquez Sworn Statement, Exhibit HH at 7-10, 12-15, 29-30, 39-41, 59-
60 and 62-67. 
25 
66. In view of this information suggesting Brunel could provide significant evidence 
of Epstein's trafficking in young girls for sexual abuse, Edwards had Brunel served in New York 
for deposition. See Notice of Deposition of Jean Luc Brunel attached hereto as Exhibit II. 
Before the deposition took place, Brunel's attorney (Tama Kudman of West Palm Beach) 
contacted Edwards to delay the deposition date. Eventually Kudman informed Edwards in 
January 2009 that Brunel had left the country and was back in France with no plans to return. 
This information was untrue; Brunel was actually staying with Epstein in West Palm Beach. See 
Banasiak deposition, deposition attachment #16 at 154-160 and 172-175; see also pages from 
Epstein's probation file evidencing Jean Luc Brunel (JLB) staying at his house during that 
relevant period of time attached Exhibit JJ. As a result, Edwards filed a Motion for Contempt, 
attached hereto as Exhibit KK (Because Epstein settled this case, the motion was never ruled 
upon.) 
67. Edwards was also informed that Epstein paid for not only Brunel's representation 
during the civil process but also paid for legal representation for Sarah Kellen (Epstein's 
executive assistant and procurer of girls for him to abuse), Larry Visoski (Epstein's personal 
pilot), Dave Rogers (Epstein's personal pilot), Larry Harrison (Epstein's personal pilot), Louella 
Rabuyo (Epstein's housekeeper), Nadia Marcinkova (Epstein's live-in sex slave), Ghislaine 
Maxwell (manager of Epstein's affairs and businesses), Mark Epstein (Epstein's brother), and 
Janusz Banasiak (Epstein's house manager) It was nearly impossible to take a deposition of 
someone that would have helpful information that was not represented by an attorney paid for by 
Epstein. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit N at ¶11. 
26 
68. While Epstein and others were preventing any legitimate discovery into his sexual 
abuse of minor girls, at the same time he was engaging (through his attorneys) in brutal 
questioning of the girls who had filed civil suits against him, questioning so savage that it made 
local headlines. See Jane Musgrave, Victims Seeking Sex offender's Millions See Painful Pasts 
Used Against Them, Palm Beach Post News, Jan. 23, 2010, available at 
hap ://www.palmbeachpost. com/news/crime/vi ctims-s eeking-s ex-offenders-millions-see-painful-
pasts-192988.html attached hereto as Exhibit LL. 
Edwards Pursues Other Lines of Discovery 
69. Because of Epstein's thwarting of discovery and attacks on Edwards's clients, 
Edwards was forced to pursue other avenues of discovery. Edwards only pursued legitimate 
discovery designed to further the cases filed against Epstein. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit 
N at 1-111. 
70. Edwards notified Epstein's attorneys of his intent to take Bill Clinton's deposition. 
Edwards possessed a legitimate basis for doing so: (a) Clinton was friends with Ghislaine 
Maxwell who was Epstein's longtime companion and helped to run Epstein's companies, kept 
images of naked underage children on her computer, helped to recruit underage children for 
Epstein, engaged in lesbian sex with underage females that she procured for Epstein, and 
photographed underage females in sexually explicit poses and kept child pornography on her 
computer; (b) it was national news when Clinton traveled with Epstein aboard Epstein's private 
plane to Africa and the news articles classified Clinton as Epstein's friend. (c) the complaint 
filed on behalf of Jane Doe No. 102 stated generally that she was required by Epstein to be 
sexually exploited by not only Epstein but also Epstein's adult male peers, including royalty, 
27 
politicians, academicians, businessmen, and/or other professional and personal acquaintances — 
categories Clinton and acquaintances of Clinton fall into. The flight logs showed Clinton 
traveling on Epstein's plane on numerous occasions between 2002 and 2005. See Flight logs 
attached hereto as Exhibit MM. Clinton traveled on many of those flights with Ghislaine 
Maxwell, Sarah Kellen, and Adriana Mucinska, - all employees and/or co-conspirators of 
Epstein's that were closely connected to Epstein's child exploitation and sexual abuse. The 
documents clearly show that Clinton frequently flew with Epstein aboard his plane, then 
suddenly stopped - raising the suspicion that the friendship abruptly ,ended, perhaps because of 
events related to Epstein's sexual abuse of children. Epstein's personal phone directory from his 
computer contains e-mail addresses for Clinton along with 21 phone numbers for him, including 
those for his assistant (Doug Band), his schedulers, and what appear to be Clinton's personal 
numbers. This information certainly leads one to believe that Clinton might well be a source of 
relevant information and efforts to obtain discovery from him were reasonably calculated to lead 
to admissible evidence. See Exhibits B, F AA, DD, and MM and Edwards Affidavit, 
Exhibit N at ¶15. 
71. Bradley J. Edwards, Esq., provided notice that he intended to take the deposition 
of Donald Trump. Edwards possessed a legitimate basis for doing so: (a) The message pads 
confiscated from Epstein's home indicated that Trump called Epstein's West Palm Beach 
mansion on several occasions during the time period most relevant to my Edwards's clients' 
complaints; (b) Trump was quoted in a Vanity Fair article about Epstein as saying I've known 
Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy, He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes 
beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it --
28 
Jeffrey enjoys his social life. Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery; He's pals 
with a passel of Nobel Prize—winning scientists, CEOs like Leslie Wexner of the Limited, 
socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, even Donald Trump. But it wasn't until he flew Bill Clinton, Kevin 
Spacey, and Chris Tucker to Africa on his private Boeing 727 that the world began to wonder 
who he is. By Landon Thomas Jr. (See article attached hereto as Exhibit NN) (c) Trump 
allegedly banned Epstein from his Maralago Club in West Palm Beach because Epstein sexually 
assaulted an underage girl at the club; (d) Jane Doe No. 102's complaint alleged that Jane Doe 
102 was initially approached at Trump's Maralago by Ghislaine Maxwell and recruited to be 
Maxwell and Epstein's underage sex slave; (e) Mark Epstein (Jeffrrey Epstein's brother) testified 
that Trump flew on Jeffrey Epstein's plane with him (the same plane that Jane Doe 102 alleged 
was used to have sex with underage girls); (f) Trump had been to Epstein's home in Palm Beach; 
(g) Epstein's phone directory from his computer contains 14 phone numbers for Donald Trump, 
including emergency numbers, car numbers, and numbers to Trump's security guard and 
houseman. Based on this information, Edwards reasonably believed that Trump might have 
relevant information to provide in the cases against Jeffrey Epstein and accordingly provided 
notice of a possible deposition. See deposition of Mark Epstein, September 21, 2009, at 48-50 
(Deposition Attachment #19); See Jane Doe 102 v. Epstein, Exhibit B; Exhibit F; 
ExhibitJ; N and See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit N at ¶13. 
72. Edwards provided notice that he intended to depose Alan Dershowitz. Edwards 
possessed a legitimate basis for doing so: (a) Dershowitz is believed to have been friends with 
Epstein for many years; (b) in one news article Dershowitz comments that, I'm on my 20th 
book... The only person outside of my immediate family that I send drafts to is Jeffrey The 
29 
Talented Mr. Epstein, By Vicky Ward on January, 2005 in Published Work, Vanity Fair (See 
article attached as Exhibit 00); (c) Epstein's housekeeper Alfredo Rodriguez testified that 
Dershowitz stayed at Epstein's house during the years when Epstein was assaulting minor 
females on a daily basis; (d) Rodriguez testified that Dershowitz was at Epstein's house at times 
when underage females where there being molested by Epstein (see Alfredo Rodriguez 
deposition at 278-280, 385, 426-427); (e) Dershowitz reportedly assisted in attempting to 
persuade the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office that because the underage females alleged to 
have been victims of Epstein's abuse lacked credibility and could not be believed that they were 
at Epstein's house, when Dershowitz himself was an eyewitness to their presence at the house; 
(f) Jane Doe No. 102 stated generally that Epstein forced her to be sexually exploited by not only 
Epstein but also Epstein's adult male peers, including royalty, politicians, academicians, 
businessmen, and/or other professional and personal acquaintances — categories that Dershowitz 
and acquaintances of Dershowitz fall into; (g) during the years 2002-2005 Alan Dershowitz was 
on Epstein's plane on several occasions according to the flight logs produced by Epstein's pilot 
and information (described above) suggested that sexual assaults may have taken place on the 
plane; (h) Epstein donated $30 Million one year to the university at which Dershowitz teaches. 
Based on this infoli__iation, Edwards had a reasonable basis to believe that Dershowitz might 
have relevant information to provide in the cases against Jeffrey Epstein and accordingly 
provided notice of a possible deposition. See Dershowitz letters to the State Attorney's office 
attached as Exhibit PP; Deposition of Alfredo Rodriguez at 278-280; Flight Logs Exhibit 
MM; Exhibits B and 00; and Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit N at ¶14. 
30 
73. Epstein's complaint alleges that Edwards provided notice that he wished to take 
the deposition of Tommy Mattola. That assertion is untrue. Mr. Mattola's deposition was set by 
the law firm of Searcy Denny Scarola Barnhart and Shipley. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit N 
at ¶16. 
74. Edwards gave notice that he intended to take David Copperfield's deposition. 
Edwards possessed a legitimate basis for doing so. Epstein's housekeeper and one of the only 
witnesses who did not appear for deposition with an Epstein bought attorney, Alfredo Rodriguez, 
testified that David Copperfield was a guest at Epstein's house on several occasions. His name 
also appears frequently in the message pads confiscated from Epstein's house. It has been 
publicly reported that Copperfield himself has had allegations of sexual misconduct made against 
him by women claiming he sexually abused them, and one of Epstein's sexual assault victims 
also alleged that Copperfield had touched her in an improper sexual way while she was at 
Epstein's house. Mr. Copperfield likely has relevant information and deposition was reasonably 
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit N at 
¶17. 
75. Epstein also takes issue with Edwards identifying Bill Richardson as a possible 
witness. Richardson was properly identified as a possible witness because Epstein's personal 
pilot testified to Richardson joining Epstein at Epstein's New Mexico Ranch. There was 
information indicating that Epstein had young girls at his ranch which, given the circumstances 
of the case, raised the reasonable inference he was sexually abusing these girls as he had abused 
girls in West Palm Beach and elsewhere. Richardson had also returned campaign donations that 
were given to him by Epstein, indicating that he believed that there was something about Epstein 
31 
with which he did not want to be associated. Richardson was not called to testify nor was he ever 
subpoenaed to testify. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit N at ¶18. 
76. Edwards learned of allegations that Epstein engaged in sexual abuse of minors on 
his private aircraft. See Jane Doe 102 Complaint, Exhibit B. Accordingly, Edwards pursued 
discovery to confirm these allegations. 
77. Discovery of the pilot and flight logs was proper in the cases brought by Edwards 
against Epstein. Jane Doe filed a federal RICO claim against Epstein that was an active claim 
through much of the litigation. The RICO claim alleged that Epstein ran an expansive criminal 
enterprise that involved and depended upon his plane travel. Although Judge Marra dismissed 
the RICO claim at some point in the federal litigation, the legal team representing 
Edwards' clients intended to pursue an appeal of that dismissal. Moreover, all of the subjects 
mentioned in the RICO claim remained relevant to other aspects of Jane Doe's claims against 
Epstein, including in particular her claim for punitive damages. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit 
N at ¶19. 
78. Discovery of the pilot and flight logs was also proper in the cases brought by 
Edwards against Epstein because of the need to obtain evidence of a federal nexus. Edwards's 
client Jane Doe was proceeding to trial on a federal claim under 18 U.S.C. § 2255. Section 2255 
is a federal statute which (unlike relevant state statutes) established a minimum level of recovery 
for victims of the violation of its provisions. Proceeding under the statute, however, required a 
federal nexus to the sexual assaults. Jane Doe had two grounds on which to argue that such a 
nexus existed to her abuse by Epstein: first, his use of telephone to arrange for girls to be abused; 
and, second, his travel on planes in interstate commerce. During the course of the litigation, 
32 
Edwards anticipated that Epstein would argue that Jane Doe's proof of the federal nexus was 
inadequate. These fears were realized when Epstein filed a summary judgment motion raising 
this argument. In response, the other attorneys and Edwards representing Jane Doe used the 
flight log evidence to respond to Epstein's summary judgment motion, explaining that the flight 
logs demonstrated that Epstein had traveled in interstate commerce for the purpose of facilitating 
his sexual assaults. Because Epstein chose to settle the case before trial, Judge Marra did not 
rule on the summary judgment motion. 
79. Edwards had further reason to believe and did in fact believe that the pilot and 
flight logs might contain relevant evidence for the cases against Epstein. Jane Doe No. 102's 
complaint outlined Epstein's daily sexual exploitation and abuse of underage minors as young as 
12 years old and alleged that Epstein's plane was used to transport underage females to be 
sexually abused by him and his friends. The flight logs accordingly were a potential source of 
information about either additional girls who were victims of Epstein's abuse or friends of 
Epstein who may have witnessed or even participated in the abuse. Based on this 
information, Edwards reasonably pursued the flight logs in discovery. 
80. In the fall of 2009, Epstein gave a recorded interview to George Rush, a reporter 
with the New York Daily News about pending legal proceedings. In that interview, Epstein 
demonstrated an utter lack of remorse for his crimes (but indirectly admitted his crimes) by 
stating: 
• People do not like it when people make good and that was one reason he (Epstein) 
was being targeted by civil suits filed by young girls in Florida; 
• He (Epstein) had done nothing wrong; 
33 
• He (Epstein) had gone to jail in Florida for soliciting prostitution for no reason; 
• If the same thing (i.e., sexual abuse of minor girls) had happened in New York, he 
(Epstein) would have received only a $200 fine; 
• Bradley J. Edwards was the one causing all of Epstein's problems (i.e., the civil 
suits brought by Jane Doe and other girls); 
• L.M. came to him as a prostitute and a drug user (i.e., came to Epstein for sex, 
rather than Epstein pursuing her); 
• All the girls suing him are only trying to get a meal ticket; 
• The only thing he might have done wrong was to maybe cross the line a little too 
closely; 
• He (Epstein) was very upset that Edwards had subpoenaed Ghisline Maxwell, that 
she was a good person that did nothing wrong (i.e., had done nothing wrong even 
though she helped procure young girls to satisfy Epstein's sexual desires); 
• With regard to Jane Doe 102 v. Epstein, which involved an allegation that Epstein 
had repeatedly sexually abused a 15-year-old girl, forced her to have sex with his 
friends, and flew her on his private plane nationally and internationally for the 
purposes of sexually molesting and abusing her, he (Epstein) flippantly said that 
the case was dismissed, indicating that the allegations were ridiculous and untrue. 
See Affidavit of Michael J. Fisten attached hereto as Exhibit QQ. 
81. The Rush interview also demonstrated perjury (a federal crime) on the part of 
Epstein. Epstein lied about not knowing George Rush. See Epstein Deposition, February 17, 
2010, taken in L.M. v. Jeffrey Epstein, case 50-2008-CA-028051, page 154, line 4 through 155 
line 9, (Deposition attachment #7), wherein Jeffrey Epstein clearly impresses that he does not 
recognize George Rush from the New York Daily News. This impression was given despite the 
fact that he gave a lengthy personal interview about details of the case that was tape recorded 
with George Rush. 
34 
Epstein 's Harassment of Witnesses Against Him 
82. At all relevant times Edwards has a good faith basis to believe and did in fact 
believe that Epstein engaged in threatening witnesses. See Incident Report, Exhibit A at p. 82, 
U.S. Attorney's Correspondence, Exhibit C - Indictments drafted by Federal Government 
against Epstein; and Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit N at ¶11. 
83. Despite three no contact orders entered against Epstein (see Exhibit C, supra), 
Edwards learned that Epstein continued to harass his victims. For example, Jane Doe had a trial 
set for her civil case against him on July 19, 2010. As that trial date approached, defendant 
Epstein intimidated her in violation of the judicial no-contact orders. On July 1, 2010, he had a 
private investigator tail Jane Doe — following her every move, stopping when she stopped, 
driving when she drove, refusing to pass when she pulled over. When Jane Doe ultimately drove 
to her home, the private investigator then parked in his car approximately 25 feet from Jane 
Doe house and flashed his high beam lights intermittently into the home. Even more 
threateningly, at about 10:30 p.m., when Jane Doe fled her home in the company of a retired 
police officer employed by Jane Doe's counsel, the private investigator attempted to follow 
Jane Doe despite a request not to do so. The retired officer successfully took evasive action and 
placed Jane Doe in a secure, undisclosed location that night. Other harassing actions against 
Jane Doe also followed. See Motion for Contempt filed by Edwards in Jane Doe v. Epstein 
detailing the event, including Fisten Affidavit attached to Motion, Composite Exhibit RR. 
Epstein Settlement of Civil Claims Against Him for Sexual Abuse of Children  
84. The civil cases Edwards filed against Epstein on behalf of L.M., E.W., and Jane 
Doe were reasonably perceived by Edwards to be very strong cases. Because Epstein had 
35 
sexually assaulted these girls, he had committed several serious torts against them and would be 
liable to them for appropriate damages. See Preceding Undisputed Facts. Because of the 
outrageousness of Epstein's sexual abuse of minor girls, Edwards reasonably expected that 
Epstein would also be liable for punitive damages to the girls. Because Edwards could show that 
Epstein had molested children for years and designed a complex premeditated scheme to procure 
different minors everyday to satisfy his addiction to sex with minors, the punitive damages 
would have to be sufficient to deter him from this illegal conduct that he had engaged in daily for 
years. Epstein was and is a billionaire. See Complaint, ¶49 (referring to Palm Beach 
Billionaire); see also Epstein Deposition, February 17, 2010, at 172-176 (Deposition 
Attachment #7) (taking the Fifth when asked whether he is a billionaire). Accordingly, Edwards 
reasonably believed the punitive damages that would have to be awarded against Epstein would 
have been substantial enough to punish him severely enough for his past conduct as well as deter 
him from repeating his offenses in the future. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit N at ¶19. 
85. On July 6, 2010, rather than face trial for the civil suits that had been filed against 
him by L.M., E.W., and Jane Doe, defendant Epstein settled the cases against him. The terms of 
the settlement are confidential. The settlement amounts are highly probative in the instant action 
as Epstein bases his claims that Edwards was involved in the Ponzi scheme on Epstein's inability 
to settle the L.M., E.W., and Jane Doe cases for minimal value. His continued inability to 
settle the claims for minimal value after the Ponzi scheme was uncovered would be highly 
probative in discrediting any causal relationship between the Ponzi scheme and Edwards's 
settlement negotiations. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit N at ¶21. 
Edwards Non-Involvement in Fraud by Scott Rothstein  
36 
86. From in or about 2005, through in or about November 2009, Scott Rothstein 
appears to have run a giant Ponzi scheme at his law firm of Rothstein, Rosenfeldt and Adler PA. 
(RRA). This Ponzi scheme involved Rothstein falsely informing investors that settlement 
agreements had been reached with putative defendants based upon claims of sexual harassment 
and/or whistle-blower actions. Rothstein falsely informed the investors that the potential 
settlement agreements were available for purchase. Plea Agreement at 2, United States v. Scott 
W. Rothstein, No. 9-60331-CR-COHN (S.D. Fla. Jan. 27, 2010) attached hereto as Exhibit SS. 
87. It has been alleged that among other cases that Rothstein used to lure investors 
into his Ponzi scheme were the cases against Epstein that were being handled by Bradley J. 
Edwards, Esq. Edwards had no knowledge of the fraud or any such use of the Epstein cases. See 
Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit N at ¶9. 
88. Bradley J. Edwards, Esq., joined RRA in about April 2009 and left RRA in 
November 2009 — a period of less than one year. Edwards would not have joined RRA had he 
been aware that Scott Rothstein was running a giant Ponzi scheme at the fitat. Edwards left 
RRA shortly after learning of Rothstein's fraudulent scheme. Id. at ¶8. 
89. At no time prior to the public disclosure of Rothstein's Ponzi scheme did Edwards 
know or have reason to believe that Rothstein was using legitimate claims that Edwards was 
prosecuting against Epstein for any fraudulent or otherwise illegitimate purpose. Id. at ¶20. 
90. Edwards never substantively discussed the merits of any of his three cases against 
Epstein with Rothstein. See Deposition of Bradley J. Edwards taken March 23, 2010, at 110-16. 
(hereinafter Edwards Depo) (Deposition Attachment #22). 
37 
91. On July 20, 2010, Bradley Edwards received a letter from the U.S. Attorney's 
Office for the Southern District of Florida — the office responsible for prosecuting Rothstein's 
Ponzi scheme. The letter indicated that law enforcement agencies had determined that Edwards 
was a victim (or potential victim) of Scott Rothstein's federal crimes. The letter informed 
Edwards of his rights as a victim of Rothstein's fraud and promised to keep Edwards informed 
about subsequent developments in Rothstein's prosecution. See Letter attached hereto as Exhibit 
92. Jeffrey Epstein filed a complaint with the Florida Bar against Bradley Edwards, 
Esq., raising allegations that Edwards and others were involved in the wrongdoing of Scott 
Rothstein. After investigating the claim, the Florida Bar dismissed this complaint. See Edwards 
Affidavit, Exhibit N at ¶23. 
Epstein Takes the Fifth When Asked Substantive Questions About His Claims Against Edwards  
93. On March 17, 2010, defendant Epstein was deposed about his lawsuit against 
Edwards. Rather than answer substantive questions about his lawsuit, Epstein repeatedly 
invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege. See Epstein Depo. taken 3/17/10, Deposition 
Attachment #1. 
94. In his deposition, Epstein took the Fifth rather than answer the question: 
Specifically what are the allegations against you which you contend Mr. Edwards ginned up?

actual value of the claim of L.M. and Jane Doe against him. Id. 
101. In his deposition, taken prior to the settlement of Edwards's clients claims against 
Epstein, Epstein took the Fifth rather than answer the question: Is there any pending claim 
against you which you contend is fabricated? Id. at 71. 
102. In his deposition, Epstein took the Fifth rather than answer the question: Did you 
ever have damaging evidence in your garbage? Id. at 74. 
103. In his deposition, Epstein took the Fifth rather than answer the question: Did

you ever socialized with Mr. Richardson [Governor of New Mexico and foimerly U.S. 
Representative and Ambassador to the United Nations] in the presence of females under the age 
of 18. Id. at 94. 
110. In his deposition, Epstein took the Fifth rather than answer the question: Have 
you ever sexually abused children? Id. at 95. 
111. In his deposition, Epstein took the Fifth rather than answer the question: Did you 
have staff members that assisted you in scheduling appointments with underage females; that is, 
females under the age of 18. Id. at 97-98. 
112. In his deposition, Epstein took the Fifth rather than answer the question: On how 
many occasions did you solicit prostitution. Id. at 102.

113. In his deposition, Epstein took the Fifth rather than answer the question: How 
many minors have you procured for prostitution? Id. at 104.

increases? Raising the top two brackets, which would affect joint filers with adjusted gross incomes above $212,300,
would raise $450-$700 billion over 10 years (depending on whether you use OMB or CBO numbers). If they cannot
agree to raise rates, another option (as in the Gang of Six plan) would be reductions in the deductibility of state and local
taxes, sales taxes, mortgage interest, etc. As this gets sorted out, let’s hope everyone recognizes that the US tax system is

Europe: Finally (!!), but now what?

For the first time since 2009, it felt last week like European policymakers were trying to get out in front of things. In
exchange for a modest amount of “private sector involvement”, Germany agreed to more generous financing terms for
Greece, Ireland and Portugal, and an expanded role for the EU-IMF lending facility (see following page). What would
the plan accomplish if implemented? While Greek debt to GDP ratios would remain well over 125% of GDP (the IMF
estimate for next year is a ridiculous 170%), Greece’s near-term financing obligations would decline, due to debt
buybacks, exchanges into long maturity bonds, and interest grace periods on new EU loans. More broadly, the plan also
allows for money to be lent to countries before they enter into an IMF program, for recapitalization of banks. All things
considered, it’s the broadest defense of the Monetary Union so far. On paper, it even looks like a free ride for
holders of Greek paper that don’t participate in the debt exchanges (they would be paid at par). So, what’s not to

like? Well, there are still questions about Greece:

** There’s a big difference between generous financing terms and generous economic terms. Greece must still meet an
enormous 5%-6% primary budget surplus target (government revenues less spending, pre-interest) during a recession
** Greece must execute on its asset sale targets, despite having little success or experience doing this in the past

You can probably see how to answer Dermot’s question. The hotel
manager calls the guest in the first room and asks him to move 3 rooms
up rather than one. He then calls the remaining guests and tells them
the same thing. Thus, he has managed to fit three more people into
the infinite hotel. Infinity plus 3 is infinity. You may worry that it takes
the manager an infinite time to call all the rooms, but it’s OK; he lives
infinitely long so it all works out.

What about fitting an infinite number of new guests into the already
full hotel? Surely then we will get stuck.

No, Hilbert’s Hotel can fit an infinite number of extra guests. Here’s
the trick: ask all the people currently in the hotel to move to the room
with double the number they are currently in — 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 4,
3 goes to 6, and so on. Now all the odd numbers are empty and you can
fit an infinite number of people into the empty odd rooms. Infinity plus

mathematical proof by Sharkovskii (1964).

The dynamical richness of these simple, single maximum, one dimensional
maps was computationally explored in the context of ecological and epidemiological
issues in the classical studies of Robert May (1976). It has been possible to relate
the individually characteristic L, R sequence behavior of human subjects on a
computer task to a unique parameter of a tent map generating those sequences
which predicted age and discriminated subclinical obsessive compulsive from
borderline syndromes (Selz and Mandell, 1993). The dynamical entropy of
unstructured L,R behavior also discriminated a population of schizophrenic patients
from normals (Paulus et al, 1996). More generally, parameter dependent dynamical
coding, built into the universal behavior of its constitutive equations, is a mechanism
with which a nonlinear dynamical system, such as nerve membrane equations as
above, or in the aggregate, the middle layer of a completely connected neural

network, can encode, Morse code-like, messages (Paulus et al, 1989).

Bifurcations, “splitting into (two) branches,” are observed over a smooth

qualitative change in the dynamical (time-dependent) pattern of the observable

particularly intuitive description). Qualitative here means how the dynamics of the

“Love your shoes. Boy, those shoes. Man... .”)

It was, in dramatic ways, a shift in foreign policy attitude and strategy—and its effects
were almost immediate. The president, ignoring if not defying foreign policy advice, gave
a nod to the Saudis’ plan to bully Qatar. Trump’s view was that Qatar was providing
financial support to terror groups—pay no attention to a similar Saudi history. (Only some
members of the Saudi royal family had provided such support, went the new reasoning.)
Within weeks of the trip, MBS, detaining MBN quite in the dead of night, would force
him to relinquish the Crown Prince title, which MBS would then assume for himself.
Trump would tell friends that he and Jared had engineered this: “We’ve put our man on
top!”

From Riyadh, the presidential party went on to Jerusalem, where the president met
with Netanyahu and, in Bethlehem, with Abbas, expressing ever greater certainty that, in
his third-person guise, “Trump will make peace.” Then to Rome to meet the pope. Then to
Brussels, where, in character, he meaningfully drew the line between Western-alliance-
based foreign policy, which had been firmly in place since World War II, and the new
America First ethos.

In Trump’s view, all this should have been presidency-shaping stuff. He couldn’t
believe his dramatic accomplishments weren’t getting bigger play. He was simply in
denial, Bannon, Priebus, and others noted, about the continuing and competing Comey
and Mueller headlines.

One of Trump’s deficiencies—a constant in the campaign and, so far, in the presidency
—was his uncertain grasp of cause and effect. Until now, whatever problems he might
have caused in the past had reliably been supplanted by new events, giving him the
confidence that one bad story can always be replaced by a better, more dramatic story. He
could always change the conversation. The Saudi trip and his bold campaign to upend the
old foreign policy world order should have accomplished exactly that. But the president
continued to find himself trapped, incredulously on his part, by Comey and Mueller.
Nothing seemed to move on from those two events.

After the Saudi leg of the trip, Bannon and Priebus, both exhausted by the trip’s intense
proximity to the president and his family, peeled off and headed back to Washington. It
was now their job to deal with what had become, in the White House staff’s absence, the
actual, even ultimate, presidency-shaping crisis.

Donald Trump is widely expected to significantly depart
from the priorities of the Obama Administration by
favoring development of additional conventional energy
resources and attempting to put the brakes on new
environmental initiatives. The GOP majorities in the
House and Senate have a similar agenda and Democrats
in Congress are expected to mobilize in opposition -- in
particular by leveraging their power in the Senateto
filibuster legislation —and publicly highlight the potential
impacts of a Trump administration’s policies.

Trump has pledged to cancel US participation in the 2015
Paris Climate agreement, and opposes implementation of
the Obama Administration’s Clean Power Plan (CPP). His
campaign literatureis heavily salted with proposalsto
provide regulatory relief to fossil fuel industries and
slanted in favor of new administrative initiatives to foster
conventional energy development. Specifically, his
website calls for the following energy-related initiatives:

» Make America energy independent, create millions of
new jobs, and protect clean air and clean water;
conserve our natural habitats, reserves and resources;
unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new
wealthto our country.

» Declare American energy dominancea strategic
economic and foreign policy goal of the United
States.

» Unleash America’s $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil,
and natural gas reserves, plus hundreds of years in
clean coal reserves.

» Become, and stay, totally independent of any need to
import energy from the OPEC cartel or any nations
hostile to our interests.

» Open onshore and offshore leasing on federal lands,
eliminate moratorium on coal leasing, and open shale
energy deposits.

» Encourage the use of natural gas and other American
energy resources that will both reduce emissions but
also reduce the price of energy and increase our
economic output.

» Rescind all job-destroying Obama executive actions.
Mr. Trump willreduce and eliminateall barriers to
responsible energy production, creating at least a half
millionjobs a year, $30 billion in higher wages, and
cheaper energy.

Given the predominance of oil and gas executives
amongst his kitchen cabinet, it is also widely expected
that President-elect Trump will try to halt additional
environmental regulatory measures proposed by the
Obama Administration, such as methane emission
curbs. It should be noted that it is difficult legally to
change or repeal regulations which have been
promulgated in final form —such as the CPP —without
going through the Administrative Procedures Act
process. Environmentallawyers can be expected to
litigate at every step of the way if Trump attemptsto
bypass Congress and eliminate the CPP by Executive
Order, and the courts may well serve as a brake on such
actions. However, environmental advocates who would
have likely tried to push a President Clinton to
administratively expand the scope of the CPP’scarbon
emission regulations beyond the electric power sector,
potentially economy-wide under Section 115 of the Clean
Air Act, may now be left to using a litigation routeto try
to force the Environmental Protection Agency to expand
the CPP to achieve this goal.

During the campaign, Trump also specifically rejected the
idea of using a carbon tax/carbon pricing as a means of
encouraging market-driven emission reductions. With
GOP chairmen of the tax-writing committees in the House
and Senate, it is very unlikely that they will schedule
hearings or markups to move carbon taxes —other than to
schedule votes in the House or Senate aimed at
undermining vulnerable Democratsup for reelection in
2018.

Additionally, the President-elect has vowed to allow
energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline
and other industrial facilities which have faced denials or
delays under the current Administration, to move
forward. Trump has proposed a $71 trillion infrastructure
plan that would rely heavily on private-public partnerships
by providing a tax credit to encourage private investors to
fund projects overseen by states and municipalities. As
conceived by Trump’s advisors, the tax credit would apply
to infrastructure projects with a dedicated source of
revenue, such as toll roads, airports or utilities financed
at least in part by fees paid by users. Decisions on which
projects to fund would generally be left to the states.

education degree level, and authorization for on-campus employment. As of March 2011,
China had the largest number of students in SEVIS, at 158,698.°

The FBI has access to all of the student data contained in SEVIS, and no longer needs

the permission of DHS to initiate investigations of foreign students.*° However, the laws,
regulations, and directives governing SEVIS do not require some additional critical pieces
of information, which are nonetheless perceived to be important to manage the program.
According to the Government Accounting Office (GAO):

e the nonimmigrant visa number, expiration date, and issuing post are optional and
only captured if entered into the system by the school or exchange visitor program;

e the nonimmigrant driver’s license number and issuing state were imposed by the
interagency working group and support investigative efforts; and

e the nonimmigrant passport number, passport expiration date, and passport issuing
country are optional and only captured if entered into the system by the school or
exchange visitor program.”’

It is difficult to ascertain from open sources whether these problems have been fixed, but
the nonmandatory data are key investigative details that would be critical for federal law
enforcement seeking to assess possible illicit technology transfers by students.

Improved export controls

The second major policy problem involves PRC student access to controled technology
under the deemed export system. According to the Commerce Department, a restricted
product or technology is “deemed,” or considered exported, when it is used by a foreign
national in the United States.?* However, under these rules, a university or research lab
does not need a deemed export license if a foreign graduate student is merely present in a
lab. It only needs a license if it intends to export that technology to the foreign national’s
country.

From 2004 to 2006, the US Commerce Department attempted to change these rules,” but
was stymied by opposition from universities and research labs.*° Yet the continued flow
of controlled technology to the PRC and the findings of GAO studies on the problems

of university oversight*' strongly suggest that Commerce’s recommendations should be
reexamined.

In 2009, then president Obama “directed a broad-based interagency reform of the US export
control system with the goal of strengthening national security and the competitiveness of
key US manufacturing and technology sectors by focusing on current threats and adapting

His present girlfriend, whom he met four years ago at a
dinner party in New York, is in dental school. One
former girlfriend, Eva Andersson Dubin, a Swedish
model and Miss Universe finalist whom Epstein has
known for more than thirty years, became a doctor—
Epstein sent her to medical school—and married hedge
funder Glen Dubin. Together they finance the Dubin
Breast Center at Mount Sinai Hospital. Most of the
women at one time will travel with Epstein to his other
floating residences—the ranch in New Mexico, a vast
apartment in Paris, the island in the Caribbean, the
house in Palm Beach.

Epstein will sometimes move a meeting in his
dining room outside to the park—his idea of going out
to lunch is a Sabrett’s hot dog—with the various girls in
the house the accompanying entourage, as though
something out of an 18th-century French court.

tabloid language, harem-like “sex slaves”—but as
attentive students (which, of course, might be regarded
as having its own fetish-like attraction). Epstein

with two busloads of friends from the kibbutz. Avraham Arnan was there, of
course. But Ahraleh Yariv and Eli Zeira, two of the military intelligence heroes
of the Six-Day War, also drove up for the wedding, which touched both Nava
and me, not to mention her family and our guests. Years later, as I rose higher in
the ranks of the military, I would sometimes be invited to weddings by officers
under my command. Remembering how much we appreciated Ahraleh’s and Eli
Zeira’s gesture. I always said yes.

It was only weeks after our wedding that I formally returned to Sayeret
Matkal. Both Nava and I were aware of the additional pressures my military
commitments might place on our family life. But she understood why I’d
chosen to go back, and was supportive. As for me, I was, if anything, more
certain that I’d made the right decision. Israel was clearly facing a whole new
set of challenges to its security. Given the decisiveness, and speed, of our
victory in 1967, there seemed no immediate danger of Egypt’s risking another
full-scale war. In Israel, where Golda Meir had become Prime Minister after
Eshkol’s death from a heart attack, there was also little appetite for returning to
the battlefield. Yet the post-war skirmishes with the Egyptians along the Suez
Canal had escalated into far more than that: what would become known as the
War of Attrition. Nor could there be any doubt, after Karameh, that Fatah’s
influence, militancy and determination would only grow, not least because even
more radical factions within the PLO were ready to step into the breach if
Arafat faltered. Israel needed to find an answer for all these threats.

Uzi Yairi’s term as Sayeret Matkal commander had by now ended, but his
successor was someone I knew well. Menachem Digli was the officer on whom
I’d bestowed my stolen Syrian Mercedes at the end of the war. His leg was now
recovered from the motorcycle accident, and I returned to the sayeret at his
deputy. He delegated full responsibility to me for operational issues. I believed
that the new kind of challenges we were confronting, particularly the prospect
of intensified attacks from the new generation of Palestinian fedaveen, meant
that the sayeret would sooner or later have to broaden its reach, moving beyond
the kind of intelligence operations we’d done before the 1967 war to become
the SAS-like special forces unit Avraham ultimately envisaged. But that was not

the Muslim brotherhood, whom the Qataris
view as the region's rising power. The
Qatari strategy is that the situation has
changed, and we need to fend for ourselves
and ensure that the regional anarchy is not
going to impact us, says Bokhari. The
Qatari investment in Rawabi -- which feeds
an $85 million investment in the Israeli
economy, and which could not have
happened without some degree of official
Israeli approval -- is an example of this
larger geopolitical strategy, which is driven
more by perceived self-interest than by an
ideological affinity for political Islam.

Investments in the region are about the
return on political influence, adds Gregory
Gause, a professor at the University of
Vermont and a non-resident senior fellow
at the Brookings Institution-Doha. He
noted the presence of a large American
airbase in Qatar, and the country's close
relations with the United States.

In the Palestinian territories, as in the
broader region, the Qataris are supporting
secular and religious forces in a way that
will maximize their influence and keep the
regional balance as favorable for them as
possible. In a sense, the same strategic
calculus that convinces Qatar to support
Hamas allows them to cooperate with Israel
and the West Bank private sector as well.

There’s another feeling the cops can’t shake: the nagging sense

A public-records demand has been filed in an effort to obtain
Reiter’s own records.

Detective Recarey tells Reiter that he, too, is being surveilled
and that his trash has been picked through.

In his entire career as a police officer, this is the first time

ing his investigators. But for the moment, he puts it aside. Recar-
ey’s doing great work on the investigation. He’s deeply invested,

levels, they can perform abstractions that mature gorillas will never learn, no matter how much we try to
train them.

The second set of mechanisms is in the motivational system. Motivation tells the brain what to pay attention
to, by giving reward and punishment. If a brain does not get much reward for solving puzzles, the individual
will find mathematics very boring and won't learn much of it. Ifa brain gets lots of rewards for discovering
other people's intentions, it will learn a lot of social cognition.

Language might be the result of three things that are different in humans:

- extended training periods per layer (after the respective layer is done, it is difficult to learn a new set of
phonemes or the first language)

- more layers

- different internal rewards. Perhaps the reward for learning grammatical structure is the same that makes us
like music. Our brains may enjoy learning compositional regular structure, and they enjoy making
themselves understood, and everything else is something the universal cortical learning figures out on its
own.

This is a hypothesis that is shared by a growing number of people these days. In humans, it is reflected for
instance by the fact that races with faster motor development have lower IQ. (In individuals of the same
group, slower development often indicates defects, of course.)

Another support comes from machine learning: we find that the same learning functions can learn visual and
auditory pattern recognition, and even end-to-end-learning. Google has built automatic image recognition
into their current photo app:
http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/07/01/google-mistakenly-tags-black-people-as-gorillas-showing-limits-of-
algorithms/

The state of the art in research can do better than that: it can begin to Imagine things. I.e. when the
experimenter asks the system to dream what a certain object looks like, the system can produce a
somewhat compelling image, which indicates that it is indeed learning visual structure. This stuff is
something nobody could do a few months ago:
http://www.creativeai.net/posts/Mv4WGé6rdzAerZF7ch/synthesizing-preferred-inputs-via-deep-generator-

networks

A machine learning program that can learn how to play an Atari game without any human supervision or
hand-crafted engineering (the feat that gave DeepMind 500M from Google) now just takes about 130 lines of
Python code.

These models do not have interesting motivational systems, and a relatively simple architecture. They
currently seem to mimic some of the stuff that goes on in the first few layers of the cortex. They learn object
features, visual styles, lighting and rotation in 3d, and simple action policies. Almost everything else is
missing. But there is a lot of enthusiasm that the field might be on the right track, and that we can learn
motor simulations and intuitive physics soon. (The majority of the people in AI do not work on this,
however. They try to improve the performance for the current benchmarks.)

Noam's criticism of machine translation mostly applies to the Latent Semantic Analysis models that Google
and others have been using for many years. These models map linguistic symbols to concepts, and relate
concepts to each other, but they do not relate the concepts to proper mental representations of what objects
and processes look like and how they interact. Concepts are probably one of the top layers of the learning
hierarchy, i.e. they are acquired *“after* we learn to simulate a mental world, not before. Classical linguists
ignored the simulation of a mental world entirely.

Q. I just need to make my record on that.

SO we are going to put aside Virginia

Roberts.

A. Okay.

Q. And I'm not talking about attorneys here
talking about -- what I'm talking about is people who
could be witnesses, people who saw things, people did
things, heard things, people who have evidence that
would be admissible in court. Do you have that in mind?

A. Okay.

Q. As of December 30th, 2014, putting aside
Miss Roberts, as to whom you've refused to answer, had
anyone who fits that category of a person with personal
knowledge of admissible evidence told you that Alan
Dershowitz had abused any other minors?

MR. SCAROLA: I'm going to instruct you not
to answer that question on the basis of the
attorney/client and work product privileges.

MR. SIMPSON: The Knowledge -- let me ask

my objection.

we'd even try to move billions of humans to Mars in the first place. The analogy
is a false one, however. We are already devoting huge scientific and technical
resources to creating ever-more-capable AI systems. A more apt analogy would
be a plan to move the human race to Mars with no consideration for what we
might breathe, drink, or eat once we'd arrived.

e Human-level Al isn’t really imminent, in any case. The AI100 report, for example,
assures us, “Contrary to the more fantastic predictions for AI in the popular press,
the Study Panel found no cause for concern that AI is an imminent threat to
humankind.” This argument simply misstates the reasons for concern, which are
not predicated on imminence. In his 2014 book, Superintelligence: Paths,
Dangers, Strategies, Nick Bostrom, for one, writes, “It 1s no part of the argument
in this book that we are on the threshold of a big breakthrough in artificial
intelligence, or that we can predict with any precision when such a development
might occur.”

e You're just a Luddite. It’s an odd definition of Luddite that includes Turing,
Wiener, Minsky, Musk, and Gates, who rank among the most prominent
contributors to technological progress in the 20th and 21st centuries.*
Furthermore, the epithet represents a complete misunderstanding of the nature of
the concerns raised and the purpose for raising them. It is as if one were to accuse
nuclear engineers of Luddism if they pointed out the need for control of the
fission reaction. Some objectors also use the term “anti-AI,” which is rather like
calling nuclear engineers “anti-physics.” The purpose of understanding and
preventing the risks of AI is to ensure that we can realize the benefits. Bostrom,
for example, writes that success in controlling AI will result in “a civilizational
trajectory that leads to a compassionate and jubilant use of humanity’s cosmic
endowment”—hardly a pessimistic prediction.

e Any machine intelligent enough to cause trouble will be intelligent enough to have
appropriate and altruistic objectives. (Often, the argument adds the premise that
people of greater intelligence tend to have more altruistic objectives, a view that
may be related to the self-conception of those making the argument.) This
argument is related to Hume’s is-ought problem and G. E. Moore’s naturalistic
fallacy, suggesting that somehow the machine, as a result of its intelligence, will
simply perceive what is right, given its experience of the world. This is
implausible; for example, one cannot perceive, in the design of a chessboard and
chess pieces, the goal of checkmate; the same chessboard and pieces can be used
for suicide chess, or indeed many other games still to be invented. Put another
way: Where Bostrom imagines humans driven extinct by a putative robot that
turns the planet into a sea of paper clips, we humans see this outcome as tragic,

Mathematical Bridge, Cambridge

Every autumn about thirty graduate students arrive at the
Engineering Department in Cambridge to join the Advanced Course in
Design, Manufacturing and Management. They expect to spend the year
walking among the city’s hallowed spires, attending lectures, bumping
into Stephen Hawking and punting on the River Cam.

Instead, they get quite a shock!

In 1989, I joined the course. There were twenty-six engineers, a
psychologist and a physicist — me. There was no prescribed syllabus;
instead the course used learning-by-experience and lectures from the
experts ina given field. To study advertising, you might visit a top London
agency, for shipbuilding a shipyard on the Clyde. If you were unlucky
enough to find these two lectures scheduled for the same week, you had
to travel the length of Britain. The course runs a half dozen minibuses
to solve this transport problem. Every four weeks we would undertake a
project in a different company. I remember designing pit props for coal
mines and imaging software for a weaving company. At the end of each
project we presented our findings to each other and, with eight projects
and thirty students, this made for a great many presentations. To keep
the process manageable, the course put great store in teaching us the art
of communication.

These days I design large complex systems, and clear communication
is extremely important. My ideas are often turned into working products

why the district court disregarded and failed to credit plaintiffs’ extensive, entirely adequate pleadings, see infra Point I.B.2;
failed to draw reasonable inferences from those pleadings, see infra *76 I.B.3; and declined to accept the truth of the facts
alleged by plaintiffs, see infra Point LB.4.

Application of this heightened standard is especially misguided in light of Congress’s intent that the ATA reach just the
conduct that plaintiffs allege. That is, “Congress[] clearly expressed [an] intent to cut off the flow of money to terrorists at
every point along the causal chain of violence.” Boim J, 291 F.3d at 1021. Congress did this by “attach[ing] liability to all
donations to foreign terrorist organizations regardless of the giver’s intent” because “foreign organizations that engage in
terrorist activity are so tainted by their criminal conduct that any contribution to such an organization facilitates that
conduct.” Jd. at 1027. Moreover, Congress enacted Section 2339B, a criminal provision incorporated through the ATA, out
of a “concern that terrorist organizations could raise funds ‘under the cloak of a humanitarian or charitable exercise.’ ” Weiss,
453 F. Supp. 2d at 626 (quoting H.R. Rep. 104-393, at 43 (1995)). That statute was designed to “ ‘severely restrict the ability
of terrorist organizations to raise much needed funds for their terrorist acts within the United States.’ ” Jd. Any effort to
impose a heightened pleading standard upon terrorism-related *77 cases, as the district court did, thus “thwart[s] Congress’
clearly expressed intent.” Boim J, 291 F.3d at 1021.

2. The District Court Understated and Ignored Plaintiffs’ Extensive Pleadings Addressing Defendants’ Knowing and
Reckless Support of Terrorism.

Although the district court acknowledged that plaintiffs had in certain respects pled that the defendants knowingly provided
support to al-Qaeda, it radically understated the scope and detail surrounding those direct allegations. Far from presenting
bare conclusions, plaintiffs abundantly provided defendants with notice of the basis for plaintiffs’ claims, including their
assertion that defendants sought to advance al-Qaeda’s activities.

For each defendant, plaintiffs’ detailed allegations focused on the knowing or reckless nature of the provision of support to
al-Qaeda. The particular allegations set forth below are in addition to plaintiffs’ extensive allegations regarding the broader
context of al-Qaeda’s use and development of a financing network, the relation between the key financiers and financing
mechanisms and al-Qaeda’s operations, and the integration of sources of financing into the broader social and ideological *78
network of persons and organizations that facilitated al-Qaeda’s activities. See supra pp. 29-60.

(a) Al Rajhi Bank

Al Rajhi Bank was founded in 1987 and “has a network of nearly 400 branch offices throughout Saudi Arabia and seventeen
worldwide subsidiaries.” SPA55 (Terrorist Attacks 1). Plaintiffs’ complaints contain numerous allegations that Al Rajhi Bank
knowingly provided an extensive amount of material support to al-Qaeda front charities, including the International Islamic
Relief Organization (“IIRO”), the Muslim World League (““MWL”), the World Association of Muslim Youth (““WAMY”),
the Benevolent International Foundation (“BIF”), the Saudi Joint Relief Committee (““SJRC”), and Al Haramain Islamic
Foundation (“Al Haramain’”). See SPA55 (Terrorist Attacks I; JA1062-65, 1069-77, 3827-29. Its provision of material
support included “knowingly and intentionally provid [ing] financial and bank account services” for al-Qaeda front charities
and “September 11th hijacker Abdulaziz al-Omari.” JA1062-77, 1784, 2483, 3827-29.' “Al Rajhi Bank has long known that
the[se] *79 accounts ... were being used to solicit and transfer funds to terrorist organizations, including al Qaida.” JA3828.
Through these bank accounts, Al Rajhi Bank “knowingly and intentionally ... facilitated [the] purchase of weapons and
military equipment.” JA2483. Al Rajhi Bank also “knowingly and intentionally lent repeated material support to Al Qaeda,”
including the front charities, “through, inter alia, the use of interstate and international faxes, telephones, wire transfers and
transmissions, and mailings.” JA1064, 1784.

The complaints further allege that Al Rajhi Bank knowingly provided material support through its involvement in raising
funds for al-Qaeda’s front charities, including by making direct donations to them, JA1068-73, 2483, guiding the donations
of its customers, JA1069-70, cooperating with the charities to advertise the existence of their bank accounts, XXXXXX, and
managing and accounting for donations, JA1071. Donations were often made as part of the Islamic duties of zakat and

Hare Krishna Murder

The most bizarre murder case I ever litigated involved a Hare Krishna leader in West Virginia,
who was charged with a wide assortment of crimes, ranging from murder—to copyright
infringement!

My clients real name was Keith Gordon Ham, but he called himself Kirtanananda Swami, or just
Swami, when he founded a Hare Krishna community in West Virginia, which he called New
Vrindaban. He became the absolute ruler of this cultish community, whose members testified that
he exercised total control over all aspects of community life. Vrindaban became a magnet for
people who wanted to lose their identity beneath the saffron robes and changed names, including
several members with criminal records and violent backgrounds. The community expanded to
3,000 acres with 500 “devotees” and profits from solicitations that reached $10-12 million. Much
of this money was allegedly obtained by selling counterfeit copywrited images of sports teams and
popular cartoon characters. Hence the copyright charge.

The events that precipitated the murder prosecution were described by the court as follows:

The. ..incident involved the murder of devotee and community member Charles St. Denis
on June 10, 1983. When community member Daniel Reid learned that St. Denis had raped
Reid's wife, Reid decided to kill St. Denis. Before attempting to murder St. Denis, Reid
consulted Swami. Swami instructed Reid that the killing was acceptable under Krishna
scriptures, but that such action violated secular laws and that Reid might be caught and
punished. Swami then directed Reid to talk to Thomas A. Drescher, a fellow devotee.
When Reid approached Drescher and told him what Swami had said, Drescher testified he
felt duty bound to help Reid kill St. Denis. The two then enticed St. Denis to Reid's house
one night, shot and stabbed him several times, and then buried him in a pre-dug grave
before he was dead.

[Another] incident likewise involved the murder of a devotee. In 1985, Steven Bryant, a
former New Vrindaban devotee, began publishing statements accusing Swami of engaging
in homosexual activity and permitting sexual molestation of children in the community.
Around April of 1986, members of the Krishna community in Los Angeles notified
Drescher that Bryant was in Los Angeles. Drescher received $2,500 from the New
Vrindaban community, authorized by Swami, and flew to Los Angeles. He located Bryant
and shot him twice in the head.

Swami and several of his lieutenants were convicted and sentenced to long terms of
imprisonment. I was asked to appeal Swami’s conviction. I read the transcript of the trial and
found it to be filled with prejudicial evidence that was irrelevant to whether Swami was
responsible for the crimes of his followers. I took this case not because I approved of anything
about Swami, but because I believe that if the most reviled defendants are not afforded a fair trial,
there is grave risk to all defendants. Greta Van Susteren, then a lawyer now a TV commentator,
was retained by one of the lutenants.

Realize that bosses are supervisors, not slave masters. Establish yourself as a consistent challenger of
the status quo and most people will learn to avoid challenging you, particularly if it is in the interest of
higher per-hour productivity.

If you are a micromanaging entrepreneur, realize that even if you can do something better than the rest
of the world, it doesn’t mean that’s what you should be doing if it’s part of the minutiae. Empower
others to act without interrupting you.

SET THE RULES in your favor: Limit access to your time, force people to define their requests before
spending time with them, and batch routine menial tasks to prevent postponement of more important
projects. Do not let people interrupt you. Find your focus and you’ll find your lifestyle.

The bottom line is that you only have the rights you fight for.

In the next section, Automation, we’ll see how the New Rich create management-free money and

People think it must be fun to be a super genius, but they don’t realize how hard it is to put up
with all the idiots in the world.

—CALVIN, from Calvin and Hobbes

B laming idiots for interruptions is like blaming clowns for scaring children—they can’t help it. It’s

their nature. Then again, I had (who am I kidding—and have), on occasion, been known to create
interruptions out of thin air. If you’re anything like me, that makes us both occasional idiots. Learn to
recognize and fight the interruption impulse.

This is infinitely easier when you have a set of rules, responses, and routines to follow. It is your job
to prevent yourself and others from letting the unnecessary and unimportant prevent the start-to-finish
completion of the important.

This chapter differs from the previous in that the necessary actions, due to the inclusion of examples
and templates, have been presented throughout from start to finish. This Q & A will thus be a summary
rather than a repetition. The devil is in the details, so be sure to reread this chapter for the specifics.

The 50,000-foot review is as follows:

1. Create systems to limit your availability via e-mail and phone and deflect inappropriate contact.
Get the autoresponse and voicemail script in place now, and master the various methods of evasion.
Replace the habit of “How are you?” with “How can I help you?” Get specific and remember—no
stories. Focus on immediate actions. Set and practice interruption-killing policies.

Avoid meetings whenever possible:

Mr. Weinberg — 
I am a reporter with the ABC News investigative unit. We are gathering background research on the major

Seeing that both former President Clinton and Mr. Trump have been mentioned in connection to the Jeffrey 
Epstein case, I am interested in better understanding the case, it's current status, and any information that 
could help explain Mr. Epstein's dealings and interactions with both men. 
I would very much appreciate the chance to meet and discuss this subject in an off the record conversation at 
your earliest convenience. 
Please let me know if that would be possible, and if so, when and where we could meet.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020064.txt,"after a long and bitter internal debate, the president announced that he had decided to
withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement. For Bannon, it was a deeply satisfying slap
in the face of liberal rectitude—Elon Musk and Bob Iger immediately resigned from
Trump’s business council—and confirmation of Trump’s true Bannonite instincts.

It was, likewise, the move that Ivanka Trump had campaigned hardest against in the
White House.

“Score,” said Bannon. “The bitch 1s dead.”

OOK Ok

There are few modern political variables more disruptive than a dedicated prosecutor. It’s
the ultimate wild card.

A prosecutor means that the issue under investigation—or, invariably, cascading issues
—will be a constant media focus. Setting their own public stage, prosecutors are certain
leakers.

It means that everybody in a widening circle has to hire a lawyer. Even tangential
involvement can cost six figures; central involvement quickly rises into the millions.

By early summer, there was already an intense seller’s market in Washington for top
criminal legal talent. As the Mueller investigation got under way, White House staffers
made a panicky rush to get the best firm before someone else got there first and created a
conflict.

“Can’t talk about Russia, nothing, can’t go there,” said Katie Walsh, now three months
removed from the White House, on advice of her new counsel.

Any interviews or depositions given to investigators risked putting you in jeopardy.
What’s more, every day in the White House brought new dangers: any random meeting
you might find yourself in exposed you more.

Bannon kept insisting on the absolute importance of this point—and for him the
strategic importance. If you didn’t want to find yourself getting wrung out in front of
Congress, your career and your net worth in jeopardy, be careful who you spoke to. More
to the point: you must not under any circumstances speak to Jared and Ivanka, who were
now Russia toxic. It was Bannon’s widely advertised virtue and advantage: “I’ve never
been to Russia. I don’t know anybody from Russia. I’ve never spoken to any Russians.
And I'd just as well not speak to anyone who has.”

Bannon observed a hapless Pence in a lot of “wrong meetings,” and helped to bring in
the Republican operative Nick Ayers as Pence’s chief of staff, and to get “our fallback
guy” out of the White House and “running around the world and looking like a vice
president.”

And beyond the immediate fears and disruption, there was the virtually certain

embodied, perspectival engagement. Our consciousness is electrically (cybernetically)
enmeshed, yet we don’t respond as if this human-generated set of elegant simulations had
its own intelligence.

The artistic use of cybernetic beings also reminds us that consciousness itself is
not just “in here.” It is streaming in and out, harmonizing those sensory, scintillating
signals. Mind happens well outside the limits of the cranium (and its simulacrum, the
“motherboard”). In Mary Catherine Bateson’s paraphrase of her father Gregory’s
second-order cybernetics, mind is material “not necessarily defined by a boundary such
as an envelope of skin.”°! Parreno pairs the simulations of art with the simulations of
mathematics to force the Wiener-like point that any such model is not, by itself, just like
life. Models are just that—parts of signaling systems constituting “intelligence” only
when their creaturely counterparts engage them in lively meaning making.
Contemporary AI has talked itself into a corner by instrumentalizing and particularizing
tasks and subroutines, confusing these drills with actual wisdom. The brief cultural
history offered here reminds us that views of data as intelligence, digital nets as “neural,”
or isolated individuals as units of life, were alien even to Conway’s brute simulation.

We can stigmatize the stubborn arrogance of current AI as “right cybernetics,” the
path that led to current automated weapons systems, Uber’s ill-disguised hostility to
human workers, and the capitalist dreams of Google. Now we must turn back to left
cybernetics—theoretical biologists and anthropologists engaged with a trans-species
understanding of intelligent systems. Gregory Bateson’s observation that corporations
merely simulate “aggregates of parts of persons,” with profit-maximizing decisions cut
off from “wider and wiser parts of the mind,” has never been more timely.*”

The cybernetic epistemology offered here suggests a new approach. The
individual mind is immanent, not only in the body but also in pathways outside the body,
and there is a larger Mind, of which the individual mind is only a subsystem. This larger
Mind, Bateson holds, is comparable to God, and is perhaps what some people mean by
“God,” but it is still immanent in the total interconnected social system and planetary
ecology. This is not the collective delusion of an exterior “God” who speaks from
outside human consciousness (this long-seated monotheistic conceit, Bateson suggests,
leads to views of nature and environment as also outside the “individual” human,
rendering them as “gifts to exploit”). Rather, Bateson’s “God” is a placeholder for our
evanescent experience of interacting consciousness-in-the-world: larger Mind as a result
of inputs and actions that then become inputs for other actions in concert with other
entities—webs of symbiotic relationships that form patterns we need urgently to sense
and harmonize with.°?

From Tsai in the 1970s to Hershman Leeson in the 1990s to Parreno in 2014,
artists have been critiquing right cybernetics and plying alternative, embodied,
environmental experiences of “artificial” intelligence. Their artistic use of cybernetic
beings offers the wisdom of symbionts experienced in the kinds of poeisis that can be
achieved in this world: rhythms of signals and intuitive actions that produce the

serialized gang murder. Peter Rosier was indicted on charges of first-degree murder and
conspiracy to murder. The prosecution’s theory was that the stepfather’s ultimate act was merely
the final stage in a family conspiracy of which Peter was the architect and participant.

Suddenly Peter Rosier found himself in jail, facing a possible death sentence in a state that has one
of the highest execution rates in the country. Right wing commentators, such as Patrick
Buchanan, compared what Peter did to what the Nazis had done under Hitler.’”’ Rosier called me
from prison on the day of his arrest and asked me to help him. I worked with his local lawyer to
get him out on bail and to formulate a trial strategy. In the event of his conviction, I was to be his
appellate lawyer.

First we had to establish through scientific evidence that suffocation, rather than morphine, was
the immediate cause of death, since Rosier did not suffocate Patricia. (Cancer was, of course, the
“but for” cause of death.) Second, we had to make the jurors wonder what they would have done
under such excruciating circumstances and to conclude that the criminal law should not sit in
judgment over loving family members who had to make a tragic choice between keeping a
promise to a comatose loved one or abandoning her in a moment of crisis.

Peter’s trial lawyer, Stanley Rosenblatt of Miami, did an excellent job persuading the jury that the
murder statutes were put on the books not for loving husbands like Peter Rosier but for brutal
killers like Charles Manson and Ted Bundy. He tried the case with emotion and empathy, inviting
the jurors to put themselves in the unenviable situation Peter faced on that terrible night. The
prosecutor, on the defensive for having given Patricia’s stepfather immunity before he knew the
facts, played the avenging angel. He demanded that the jurors simply apply the law to the facts
and not distinguish among murders on the basis of motive.

The jury understood—even if the prosecutors and Pat Buchanan did not—the differences between
love and hate, between a self-willed voluntary death and a death involuntarily imposed by others.
After weeks of trial, it took the jury only a few hours to acquit Peter Rosier of all criminal
liability. The prosecution had lost all credibility by asking the jury to treat Dr. Rosier as if he were
the functional equivalent of a gangland killer. Had the prosecution charged Dr. Rosier with
assisting the suicide of another—which is a crime under Florida law—it might have had a better
shot at a conviction. But by overcharging him with first-degree murder, it made it difficult for the
jury to take its case as anything but a vendetta.

One important role the jury plays in our system of justice is to serve as the moral conscience of
the community and as the common sense moderator of harsh general statutes. This Florida jury,
which included several older people who themselves had living wills, decided that what Peter
Rosier did, was not murder, even if the strict letter of the law did not authorize him to help his
wife choose the time and manner of her imminent death.

” A strange analogy for Buchanan who has expressed admiration for Hitler and doubt that the Nazis gassed Jews
during the Holocaust.

therefore generate energy. There was a concern that if the right catalyst
was accidentally introduced into the oceans they would solidify into
polywater thus dooming the human race, or at the very least making
water sports impossible!

Feynman was consulted and stated, “If there were such a substance
as polywater then there would have evolved an animal that eats water
and excretes polywater, using the liberated energy as its power source.
Since there is no such animal, polywater does not exist?

Feynman's proof is an elegant indirect proof coupled with a
syllogism. Polywater exists. Polywater is a lower energy form of the high-
energy substance called water. Food is a high-energy substance that can
be converted to a low energy substance by a process we shall call ‘being
good to eat? All things on earth that are good to eat have something that
eats them. Polywater is a food and therefore good to eat. Therefore an
animal must exist that eats polywater. No such animal exists, so either
something in our chain of logic is wrong, or the premise is unsound.
Since the chain is sound, the original premise must be wrong: Polywater
cannot exist.

In short, Feynman’s proof says: if a thing is so, then the inevitable
consequence is the evolution of something else, and since that something
else does not exist, the original thing cannot be so. QED: disproof by
nonexistent consequence.

The polywater disproof neatly demonstrates the important elements
of Feynman's Evolutionary proof. First, life must be continuously exposed
to the thing in question, in this case water. This is clearly so as most life
on planet Earth lives in the oceans or is intimately entwined with water.
Evolution takes time, so enough time must be allowed for life to evolve.
It must be a nearly linear problem so that a solution proceeds in steps
where each step is an improvement and no step requires too high a level
of mutation or adaption. We can illustrate the boundary between a linear
problem and one requiring a step change by describing how triple drug
therapy works in the treatment of AIDS.

Until triple drug therapy entered the picture progress against AIDS
had been a depressing story of drug discovery followed by the almost
immediate evolution of the virus to evade the drug. The AIDS virus
is a retrovirus with a shell composed of sugar molecules. It is almost
trivial for an AIDS virus to mutate these outer markings to look different,
even from one day to the next. This is the way the virus continually
and nimbly evades our immune system. However, the AIDS virus does
have some components that it can’t easily mutate because they are not
merely aesthetic, they have a functional purpose. Why not target them?

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031148.txt,"As a reminder, since 2001, rising oil prices have coincided with a gradual exhaustion of conventional oil to meet marginal
demand, sharp increases in operating and commodity input costs for oil companies, deeper exploratory and developmental
wells, reliance on a shrinking number of deepwater fields, rising E&P spending by US oil majors to meet rising EM
demand, etc. A simplified version of this dynamic appears below: as oil production rises to meet global demand, the
sources for the marginal barrel become more expensive and more complicated. Without getting into the whole Peak Oil
thing, I do think there is evidence that the marginal cost of oil will be a speed bump on growth in the years ahead,
if oil production has to rise over 90 million barrels per day to support demand and the building of strategic
reserves.

Output from the Congressional Centrifuge
In the midst of all the above, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi issued the following press release:

“Independent reports confirm that speculators are driving up the cost of oil, hurting consumers and potentially
damaging the economic recovery. Wall Street profiteering, not oil shortages, is the cause of the price spike. In fact,
U.S. oil production is at its highest level since 2003, and millions of acres have been cleared for additional
development. We need to take strong action to protect consumers from this speculation. Unfortunately,
Republicans have chosen to protect the interests of Wall Street speculators and oil companies instead of the
interests of working Americans by obstructing the agencies with the responsibility of enforcing consumer
protection laws. They have also repeatedly opposed our efforts to end billions of dollars in outdated taxpayer
subsidies for oil companies enjoying record profits.

We support efforts by the Obama Administration to expand domestic energy resources, including natural gas and
renewable sources like wind and solar that create jobs in America and will end our dangerous dependence on
foreign energy supplies. This can be achieved because today, the United States currently has more oil and gas rigs at
work than the rest of the world combined, and imports of foreign oil have decreased.

We call on the Republican leadership to act on behalf of American consumers and join our efforts to crack down on
speculators who care more about their profits than the price at the pump even if these spikes harm the American
consumer and our economy.”

I am of course not going to comment directly on this, for many reasons, including not wanting to spend my days at
California’s solar-powered detention facility in Chuckawalla Valley. However, for anyone interested in the specific
points raised in this press release, I have included some charts on the unfortunately binding constraints of science
and energy economics. Enjoy.

the Alert.

On December 18, 2015, President Obama signed into law a bill that significantly reforms the provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code that were originally added 35 years ago by the Foreign Investment in
Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (FIRPTA). The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (the
PATH Act) also includes extensions of a number of tax relief provisions that expired at the end of
2015. The PATH Act makes foreign capital investment in U.S. real estate, energy and infrastructure
assets more attractive by expanding certain exemptions from FIRPTA and clarifying the application of
certain FIRPTA provisions to REITs and their shareholders.

|. FOREIGN PENSION FUNDS EXEMPTED FROM FIRPTA TAXATION

One of the most significant provisions of the PATH Act is the addition of a complete exemption from
FIRPTA for qualified foreign pension funds and entities wholly owned by such funds, effective on
the date of enactment. A foreign pension fund is qualified if it is subject to government regulation
and certain reporting requirements in its home jurisdiction, is established to provide retirement or
pension benefits to participants or beneficiaries that are current or former employees, has no greater
than 5 percent beneficiaries, and enjoys tax benefits on either contributions or investment income in
its home jurisdiction. The new exemption applies to direct investments and investments made
through partnerships (including private equity funds). The PATH Act provides for certain details to be
addressed by Treasury Regulations. It appears that the entities eligible for the FIRPTA exemption
could include a U.S. or foreign blocker corporation that is wholly owned by a qualifying foreign
pension fund. This exemption will, for the first time, permit foreign pension funds, including some

Note that the regular rules of the Internal Revenue Code other than FIRPTA still would apply to the
foreign pension fund. Therefore, a foreign pension fund that invested in a partnership that was
engaged in a U.S. business (real estate or non-real estate) would still be subject to U.S. federal income
tax on its share of the partnership's effectively connected U.S. business income in the same manner
as other non-U.S. persons making an investment in a U.S. business partnership.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016821.txt,"WRONG, BUT MORE RELEVANT THAN EVER
Seth Lloyd

Seth Lloyd is a theoretical physicist at MIT, Nam P. Suh Professor in the Department of
Mechanical Engineering, and an external professor at the Santa Fe Institute.

The Human Use of Human Beings, Norbert Wiener’s 1950 popularization of his highly
influential book Cybernetics: Control and Communication in the Animal and the
Machine (1948), investigates the interplay between human beings and machines in a
world in which machines are becoming ever more computationally capable and powerful.
It is aremarkably prescient book, and remarkably wrong. Written at the height of the
Cold War, it contains a chilling reminder of the dangers of totalitarian organizations and
societies, and of the danger to democracy when it tries to combat totalitarianism with
totalitarianism’s own weapons.

Wiener’s Cybernetics looked in close scientific detail at the process of control via
feedback. (“Cybernetics,” from the ancient Greek for “helmsman,” is the etymological
basis of our word “governor,” which is what James Watt called his pathbreaking
feedback control device that transformed the use of steam engines.) Because he was
immersed in problems of control, Wiener saw the world as a set of complex, interlocking
feedback loops, in which sensors, signals, and actuators such as engines interact via an
intricate exchange of signals and information. The engineering applications of
Cybernetics were tremendously influential and effective, giving rise to rockets, robots,
automated assembly lines, and a host of precision-engineering techniques—in other
words, to the basis of contemporary industrial society.

Wiener had greater ambitions for cybernetic concepts, however, and in 7he
Human Use of Human Beings he spells out his thoughts on its application to topics as
diverse as Maxwell’s Demon, human language, the brain, insect metabolism, the legal
system, the role of technological innovation in government, and religion. These broader
applications of cybernetics were an almost unequivocal failure. Vigorously hyped from
the late 1940s to the early 1960s—to a degree similar to the hype of computer and
communication technology that led to the dotcom crash of 2000-200 1—cybernetics
delivered satellites and telephone switching systems but generated few if any useful
developments in social organization and society at large.

Nearly seventy years later, however, Ze Human Use of Human Beings has more
to teach us humans than it did the first time around. Perhaps the most remarkable feature
of the book is that it introduces a large number of topics concerning human/machine
interactions that are still of considerable relevance. Dark in tone, the book makes several
predictions about disasters to come in the second half of the 20th century, many of which
are almost identical to predictions made today about the second half of the 21st.

For example, Wiener foresaw a moment in the near future of 1950 in which
humans would cede control of society to a cybernetic artificial intelligence, which would
then proceed to wreak havoc on humankind. The automation of manufacturing, Wiener
predicted, would both create large advances in productivity and displace many workers
from their jobs—a sequence of events that did indeed come to pass in the ensuing
decades. Unless society could find productive occupations for these displaced workers,
Wiener warned, revolt would ensue.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011561.txt,"This interlude instantly conferred on us the desert equivalent of street cred.
The next morning, Talik agreed we could accompany the Seventh Brigade as it
moved deeper into the Sinai, and peel off when we got closer to Gebel Libni to
complete our “sayeret mission.” Given the early course of the fighting, and our
forces’ rapid advances in the Sinai, I couldn’t help wondering whether there
was any real need to defuse, much less remove, the bugging machinery. But the
very fact that the kirya, in the early hours of the war, had still wanted us to try
was a reflection of the deep sense of apprehension in Israel in the weeks before
the war. Even now, it appeared, there was a concern that the Egyptians might
reclaim the parts of the Sinai which we had captured.

When the armored column got close to Gebel Libni, I pulled our Jeep aside
and headed for the stretch of communications cable where we’d planted the
intercept. For several hours, I tried to accomplish in broad daylight what I’d
failed to do in the desert darkness four months earlier. But it was no use. I
finally told Avraham we’d be better off just blowing it up. I attached an
explosive charge and set a two-minute delay. We watched from a couple of
hundred yards away as the whole assembly disintegrated. Then we rejoined the
Seventh Brigade.

Before sunset on the third day of the war, we reached the Egyptian air base
at Bir Gafgafa in the heart of the Sinai. Even had the war ended then, we would
have been in control of a large chunk of the desert buffer zone which Ben-
Gurion had hoped to retain after the 1956 war. But now, more quickly than even
the most optimistic planners in the kirva could have anticipated, Talik was
poised to move on — toward the Suez Canal, and the main towns and cities of
Egypt. As the Seventh Brigade billeted down in Bir Gafgafa, Talik sent his
reserve brigade westward, in the direction of the canal.

We went with them. The battalion was more mobile than a pure tank force,
but also more vulnerable: lightly armored French AMX-13s and a collection of
the halftracks which I dimly, unfondly, remembered from my fironut. A few of
the AMXs led the way, then a line of halftracks, and more tanks at the rear. I
nosed our Jeep into the middle, behind the battalion commander, a lieutenant-
colonel named Ze’ev Eitan. There were scattered groups of Egyptian soldiers on
either side of us, and they aimed an occasional burst of fire in our direction. But
there seemed little point in shooting back. We didn’t need to fight, and it was
clear that the Egyptians didn’t really want to.

Shortly before dark, Lieutenant-Colonel Eitan brought our column to halt.
The road we were on cut through tall sandunes on either side. We knew there

provide an FTO with “material support or resources,” which is
broadly defined as any “property or service,” including money,
training and advice, safe haven, transportation, and weapons, among
other forms of assistance. Violation of this statute is punishable by up
to 15 years in prison, or life in prison if the support results in the
death of any person.

The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)
also enforces sanctions against Hamas and its affiliates, forbidding
U.S. persons from engaging in any transactions with a designated
terrorist, and further requiring that U.S. financial institutions block
any transactions involving assets of FTOs. OFAC frequently imposes
civil fines against violators of these sanctions, who may also suffer
criminal penalties.

The U.S. government has enforced these laws by bringing several
high-profile criminal prosecutions against various individuals and
charitable organizations for raising funds for Hamas. In 2008, for
example, a federal jury in Texas convicted five U.S. citizens on
charges of providing material support to Hamas through their
ostensibly charitable organization, the Holy Land Foundation,
resulting in sentences of 15 to 65 years in prison. The Treasury
Department has also targeted charities acting as fundraising fronts for
Hamas, such as the Al-Aqsa Foundation, an international relief
organization formerly based in Germany that Treasury designated a
terrorist entity in 2003, aiming to put them out of business by
freezing their bank accounts.

Current U.S. law, then, clearly forbids and severely punishes a wide
range of assistance to Hamas. But what if Hamas takes a leading role
in another organization not designated as an FTO -- specifically, the
PA? This question arose in 2006, when Hamas members defeated
Fatah in that year’s Palestinian elections. Hamas’ presence in the PA
posed a significant challenge to U.S. interests in the Palestinian

it says.

Only a year after troops withdrew from Iraq, that country is not talked
about in Washington, like an embarrassing relative. In North Africa, the
US military has taken a back seat while the work of toppling Colonel
Muammar Qaddafi and driving back the jihadists in Mali has been left to
Franco-British forces. Syrian policy is one of drift, where the
administration finds all options unpalatable. In Egypt, Washington has set
a red line for the Muslim Brotherhood leadership: it must adhere to the
peace treaty with Israel. Everything else is negotiable.

This week the Pentagon revealed that it would no longer be stationing two
aircraft carriers in the Gulf region, as it has done for most of the past two
years, due to cuts in the defence budget, and the possibility of even more
stringent ones if Congress fails to agree on raising the US debt ceiling.

The Iranian nuclear programme remains a priority in Washington, but the
carrier decision indicates a less warlike stance. One cannot say that US
power is ebbing, but there is a clear lack of political will in Washington
for decisive action in the Middle East. For now, the logic is that regional
powers will have to take more responsibility. Egypt, although impotent at
the moment, will have to find its role. The US needs to talk to Iran if there
is ever going to be a compromise on its nuclear programme. Maybe Egypt
could help.

Both Egypt and Iran have denied a report that General Qassem Suleimani,
commander of the Quds force, a division of the Iranian Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps, and the man responsible for Iran's military
operations in Syria, visited Cairo in January. There was no reaction in
Washington to this report.

If there is going to be a resolution of the Syrian crisis without a decade of
Lebanon-style war, then allies of the US will have to speak to someone of
the calibre of Gen Suleimani, a far more important figure than Mr
Ahmadinejad. Could this lead to a historic compromise between the
Muslim Brotherhood and the ayatollahs to create a new Islamic front
spreading revolution?

Milton Friedman, another nobelist, had a different take. We had given talks ata Cato

had written that money ought to earn nothing so that we wouldn’t own too much.
Any attempt to back money with anything, he told me, would meet John Law's fate
in the Mississippi bubble. The backing commodity would become inflated and then

crash. So Nobelists can disagree.

My version of the same idea today looks first to ETFs (exchange traded funds),
which are more liquid and money-like than mutual funds. ETFs are usually index
funds, which replicate index holdings with no active management and so charge
very small expense ratios. But mutual funds might become money too. My idea, dead
opposite from Friedman’s, is that both money supply and money yield should be

held as high as possible.

What would happen to banks? Major angst, but not much damage. They would
devolve into their separate deposit and lending specialties, with separate
stockholders and only incidental interaction. Deposits would be invested in ETFs or
mutual funds. Federal deposit insurance would wither away as unneeded. There are
no runs on ETFs. Lending banks would have to raise funds to lend from investors

expecting a return.

Is there a downside? There is certainly a risk of one. The devil we don’t know is

7.3 Toward a Formal Characterization of Real-World General
Intelligence

Having defined what we mean by an agent acting in an environment, we now turn to the
question of what it means for such an agent to be “intelligent.”

As we have reviewed extensively in Chapter 2 above, “intelligence” is a commonsense, “folk
psychology” concept, with all the imprecision and contextuality that this generally entails.
One cannot expect any compact, elegant formalism to capture all of its meanings. Even in
the psychology and AI research communities, divergent definitions abound; Legg and Hutter
[L107a] lists and organizes 70+ definitions from the literature.

Practical study of natural intelligence in humans and other organisms, and practical de-
sign, creation and instruction of artificial intelligences, can proceed perfectly well without an
agreed-upon formalization of the “intelligence” concept. Some researchers may conceive their
own formalisms to guide their own work, others may feel no need for any such thing.

But nevertheless, it is of interest to seek formalizations of the concept of intelligence, which
capture useful fragments of the commonsense notion of intelligence, and provide guidance for
practical research in cognitive science and AI. A number of such formalizations have been given
in recent decades, with varying degrees of mathematical rigor. Perhaps the most carefully-
wrought formalization of intelligence so far is the theory of “universal intelligence” presented by
Shane Legg and Marcus Hutter in [LI07b], which draws on ideas from algorithmic information
theory.

Universal intelligence captures a certain aspect of the “intelligence” concept very well, and
has the advantage of connecting closely with ideas in learning theory, decision theory and
computation theory. However, the kind of general intelligence it captures best, is a kind which
is in a sense more general in scope than human-style general intelligence. Universal intelligence
does capture the sense in which humans are more intelligent than worms, which are more
intelligent than rocks; and the sense in which theoretical AGI systems like Hutter’s AIXI or
AIXI® [Hut05] would be much more intelligent than humans. But it misses essential aspects
of the intelligence concept as it is used in the context of intelligent natural systems like humans
or real-world AI systems.

Our main goal in this section is to present variants of universal intelligence that better
capture the notion of intelligence as it is typically understood in the context of real-world
natural and artificial systems. The first variant we describe is pragmatic general intelligence,
which is inspired by the intuitive notion of intelligence as “the ability to achieve complex goals
in complex environments,” given in [Goe93a]. After assuming a prior distribution over the
space of possible environments, and one over the space of possible goals, one then defines the
pragmatic general intelligence as the expected level of goal-achievement of a system relative
to these distributions. Rather than measuring truly broad mathematical general intelligence,
pragmatic general intelligence measures intelligence in a way that’s specifically biased toward
certain environments and goals.

Another variant definition is then presented, the efficient pragmatic general intelligence,
which takes into account the amount of computational resources utilized by the system in
achieving its intelligence. Some argue that making efficient use of available resources is a defining
characteristic of intelligence, see e.g. [Wan06].

A critical question left open is the characterization of the prior distributions corresponding
to everyday human reality; we give a semi-formal sketch of some ideas on this in Chapter 9
below, where we present the notion of a “communication prior,” which assigns a probability

BC-US--Obama-Attorney Genera1,2nd Ld-Writethru 
Former Obama lawyer nixes attorney general offer 
Former White House counsel turns down chance to succeed Eric Holder as attorney 
general 
By NEDRA PICKLER 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Former White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler has told President Barack Obama 
she doesn't want to be nominated for attorney general, after he asked her to consider succeeding Eric Holder, 
people familiar with the discussions told The Associated Press on Friday. 
Ruemmler was concerned that her experience as a close adviser to the president would have led to a difficult 
confirmation process in the current highly charged partisan environment, the sources said, speaking on a 
condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private discussions. They say Ruemmler, a 
top official at the Justice Department before moving to the White House, was also concerned that could ignite 
political attacks against Obama. 
Ruemmler's withdrawal, in a phone call to the president Wednesday, leaves no obvious front-runner to replace 
Holder, who announced a month ago that he would step down once a replacement was confirmed. Ruemmler 
brought the law enforcement bonafides of a former prosecutor in the Bush administration who won convictions 
against Enron's executives and the national security expertise of a top White House official. 
Other candidates that administration officials have said have been considered include Solicitor General Don 
Verrilli; Labor Secretary Tom Perez; Loretta Lynch, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York; Preet 
Bharara, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York; Jenny Durkan, who resigned as U.S. attorney in 
Washington state last month; former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano; Tony West, who recently 
resigned as the No. 3 official at the Justice Department and has taken a job at Pepsico; and Deputy Homeland 
Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. 
Ruemmler, now a partner at Latham & Watkins specializing in government investigations, had the closest 
relationship of the attorney general candidates to the president after serving as his legal gatekeeper at the White 
House. But that relationship also would have brought tough scrutiny, with Republicans likely to question her 
handling of controversies involving the IRS, Benghazi and the investigation of a White House volunteer in a 
prostitution scandal. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026605 
Obama's aides say he has not yet made up his mind on whom to nominate and won't announce a choice until 
after the Nov. 4 elections, in part to avoid making the nominee into a political issue facing embattled 
Democratic candidates. They say he also hasn't decided whether to seek confirmation in the Senate's lame duck 
session later this year or to wait until the new year, when Republicans are expected to pick up seats if not win 
outright control. 
White House chief of staff Denis McDonough said in a statement, Kathy is someone who always tells it like it 
is, is a world class lawyer and remains a trusted adviser to the president. Anyone who knows Kathy knows she 
has impeccable judgment, extraordinary foresight and is a formidable force. But she is also as selfless as they 
come, and the president is proud to call her a close friend.

incentive compensation awards beginning in 2006 based on our performance against specific Adjusted
EBITDA targets, we will accrue expenses ranging from $2.6 million in 2006 to $15.2 million in 2011 if our
Adjusted EBITDA meets the projections set forth in this Memorandum. Each award is payable at the end
of three years based on performance and subject to continued employment (with certain exceptions).
The accrued expenses associated with an award in each period are non-cash, subject to cash settlement
when and if the award for that period is earned at the end of the third year. The actual expenses could be
higher or lower depending on whether actual Adjusted EBITDA performance exceeds or is less than the
amounts projected herein.

It was God who instructed Bill O’ Reilly to consider every utterance

Whenever anybody claims that God talks directly to them, | think they’ re
totally delusional. George W. Bush is no exception. Not only was he told by
his senior adviser, Karen Hughes, not to refer to terrorists as “folks,” but
Bush was also being prompted by God Him-Her-or-lItself: “God would tell
me, ‘George, go and end the tyranny in Iraq.’ And | did.” As if he were
merely following divine orders.

In July 2003, during a meeting with Palestinian Prime Minister
Mahmoud Abbas, Bush told the newly elected leader, “God told me to
strike at Al-Qaeda and | struck them, and then He instructed me to strike
at Saddam, which | did. And now | am determined to solve the problem in
the Middle East. If you help me, | will act, and if not, the elections will come

On confronting dogma, | of course agree — though in my opinion the secular religions — nationalist fanaticism, etc. —
are much more dangerous. And if some find rational discussion offensive — as, for example, mainstream academics
find dismantling myths of “American exceptionalism” or “Israeli self-defense” or Obama’s mass murder campaign,
etc., offensive — so be it.

But | don’t see why that should extend to ridicule. That includes astrologists. Astronomers can refute astrology, while
recognizing that perfectly honest and deluded people may believe it and should be treated with respect, while their
beliefs are confronted with evidence. | also don’t see why we should ridicule religious dogma, just as | don’t think we
should ridicule the much more pernicious secular dogmas. Rather, we should respond to irrational belief with
argument and evidence, while recognizing that their advocates (like most of the intellectual world in the case of
secular dogma) are people who we should be responding to but without ridiculing them. It may be hard

sometimes. For example, when the icon and founding father of sober non-sentimental Realism in International Affairs
informs us that the US, unlike other countries, has a “transcendental purpose,” and the fact that it constantly acts in
contradiction to its purpose doesn’t matter because the facts are just “abuse of history” while real history is “the
evidence of history as our minds reflect it,” then it’s hard to avoid ridicule. But we should. There’s no point ridiculing
virtually the entire IR profession and the major journals, even though such extraordinary irrationality leads to major
human disasters.

On Davis, | frankly think that’s a non-issue. If she decides she cannot do her job as the conditions of employment

indexes overall, according to the company.

The bigger universe of investors would likely boost the
trading multiples of the firms’ stocks. It’s unclear how big the
economic benefit of increased ownership would be, so the
question is whether it would make up for the higher taxes.
“There’s no way to say how much multiple expansion you
could get by converting,” said Gerald O’ Hara, who follows
private equity firms for Jefferies Group. “That’s the question
here that I think these firms are wrestling with.”

Tax Complexity

One of the main reasons the funds have stayed away from
private equity managers is tax complexity. Investors in typical
stocks receive a Form 1099, a straightforward document that
shows interest and dividends on investments at the end of each
year. Owners of publicly traded private equity firms’ stock get
the Schedule K-1 instead. The K-1 shows their share of the
partnership’s interest, which determines how much the income is
taxed. It’s a headache, O’Hara said. Plus, firms can be
inconsistent on the time of year they send out the forms, and
the process of plugging in the numbers on a Schedule K-1 isn’t
as simple as it is for other kinds of income.

So asset managers, which offer options for many 401(k)
investors, avoid buying shares of private equity firms.

On the campaign trail last year, President Donald Trump

said he wasn’t a fan of Wall Street “paper pushers” like hedge
fund managers. He pledged to raise the tax rate on carried
interest. The new tax law keeps it unchanged for investments
held at least three years.

Hamilton Lane

Proponents of conversion to corporations point to Hamilton

Lane Inc., an alternative-investment manager and pension-fund
consultant that’s a corporation and not a publicly traded
partnership. The $1.9 billion company, which went public earlier
this year, is now included in dozens of S&P, Russell and
WisdomTree Investments Inc. indexes. Hamilton Lane shares have
about doubled since the initial public offering.

Ares Management LP, created by former Apollo executives, is

the most likely of its peers to make the jump, according to

analysts at Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. Much of its revenue
comes from management fees, so becoming a corporation would hurt
its after-tax earnings relatively little.

Bill Mendel of Mendel Communications, a spokesman for Ares,
said the firm is studying the situation. Apollo spokesman

Charles Zehren of Rubenstein Associates declined to comment.
When Black spoke to the Goldman Sachs conference, he said

he was certain of one thing: None of the big publicly traded
partnerships wanted to be first to undergo conversion.

Years later, after Anatoly, now Natan, became a leading political figure in Israel, we were both
invited to speak at the celebration of Israel’s 60 birthday. Many world leaders were also invited.
One of the events was held in the Inbal Hotel in Jerusalem.

I got into the elevator and by coincidence both Mikael Gorbachov and Sharansky got into the
same elevator. Gorbachov recognized us (I had met him in Moscow during one of my human
rights trips while he was the Chairman of the Communist Party and the head of state). He pointed
at me and said to Sharanksy: “He’s a good lawyer, but I’m an even better lawyer.” Sharansky
replied, “But he got me out of the Soviet prison.” Gorbachov smiled and said “I got you out. He
helped, but without me you would have sat longer.” We all got a good laugh and shook hands.

A CRACK IN CREATION

Gene Editing and the Unthinkable Power to Control Evolution

By Jennifer A. Doudna and Samuel H. Sternberg

[US — Houghton Mifflin, UK — Bodley Head, China — Hunan Science, Audio — Audible; Manuscript; Pub
Date: June 2017; 320 pages]

In the tradition of The Double Helix, A Crack in Creation is an insider’s account of the biggest scientific
discovery of our era: a cheap, easy way of rewriting genetic code, with nearly limitless promise and peril.

Not since the atomic bomb has a technology so alarmed its inventors that they warned the world against its use.
Not, that is, until the spring of 2015, when biologist Jennifer Doudna called for a worldwide moratorium on the
use of the new gene-editing tool CRISPR to make heritable changes in human embryos. The cheapest, simplest,
most effective way of manipulating DNA ever known, CRISPR may well give us the cure to HIV, genetic
diseases, and some cancers, and will help address the world’s hunger crisis. Yet even the tiniest changes to DNA
could have myriad, unforeseeable consequences—to say nothing of the ethical and societal repercussions of
intentionally mutating embryos to create better humans.

Writing with fellow researcher Samuel Sternberg, Doudna shares the thrilling story of her discovery, and
passionately argues that enormous responsibility comes with the ability to rewrite the code of life. With
CRISPR, she shows, we have effectively taken control of evolution. What will we do with this unfathomable
power?

JENNIFER A. DOUDNA 1s a professor in the Chemistry and the Molecular and Cell Biology Departments at
the University of California, Berkeley, investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and researcher in
the Physical Biosciences Division at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. She is internationally
recognized as a leading expert on RNA-protein structure and function, CRISPR biology, and genome
engineering.

SAMUEL H. STERNBERG received his PhD from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2014, and has
been a member of Jennifer Doudna’s laboratory since 2010. He was a lead researcher and author of numerous
high-profile publications on the CRISPR technology. He has been awarded the RNA Society’s Scaringe Award
and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center’s Harold M. Weintraub Graduate Student Award, among other
honors.

serve as a basis for identifying a “crime victim’ as defined in the CVRA, the
class of victims with statutory rights may well be broader.””'°’

Paletz and Skinner similarly provide scant support for the
Department’s position. In Skinner, a prison inmate attempted to bring a pro
se civil suit against another inmate for allegedly attacking him during
incarceration.'°* In dismissing the suit in an unpublished decision, the
district court recognized that the Government had expressly declined to
bring charges against the other inmate and concluded that the CVRA did
not create a “mechanism to bring an action against Defendant directly.”!”
In Paletz, that same inmate brought a similar pro se claim against another
inmate, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the FBI, and the U.S. Attorney
General.!'° In a parallel, unpublished decision, the district court dismissed
the suit, noting that the CVRA is designed to give victims certain rights
‘Within the prosecutorial process against a criminal defendant.”!!

Because Skinner and Paletz involve (apparently frivolous) civil suits,
they say nothing about the CVRA’s reach in criminal cases, and any
language to that effect would be pure dicta. Moreover, the courts’ terse
analysis in both cases does not contain any substantive discussion of
whether CVRA rights apply in criminal cases before the filing of charges.
Instead, the courts simply cited to language from a Second Circuit decision
that stated that the CVRA does not give victims any rights against
defendants until those defendants have been convicted'!’—a holding clearly
limited to restitution, as many other CVRA rights clearly apply before
conviction.''* Reviewing these two cases in an extended, published
opinion, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas noted that
reading these two decisions as standing for the proposition that charges
must be filed for CVRA rights to attach “appears inconsistent with the
CVRA recognition of certain subsection (a) rights that apply during
investigation, before any charging instrument is filed.”'!* As a result, OLC

region, which when endlessly dilated looks like the same dust. Some
mathematicians call these objects “Lebesgue points” because even though at low
magnifications when they look rather solid, they are not. Composed of points, they

have topological measure zero (a line has measure one) and non-integer fractal

dimension. These 4=0, D = Integer, period doubling accumulation points can be
found in a wide variety of attractors, though in each case the parameter space in
which they are located is so small (in point set topology also called “Lebesgue
measure zero”) that they are very difficult to locate and therefore have little chance

of being physiologically significant.

This constrasts with a relatively new category of dynamical systems which
promises to be important in studies of the nervous system. These are ones that are
driven by two or more independent frequencies (called quasiperiodic driving). We
found them to be relevant to brain stem, thalamocortical neurophysiology of

perceptual processes and states of consciousness. They have the properties,

A=0, Do and D; # integer and a characteristic scaling “spectral distribution
function” (see below). They have been named “strange nonchaotic attractors”
(Grebogi et al, 1984; Romeiras et al, 1987; Ding et al, 1989). In addition, the
strange nonchaotic behavior of these quasiperiodically-driven, nonlinear oscillators
has positive (>0) measure in parameter space and thus is of potential physiological
significance. A good demonstration of a multiple frequency driven strange
nonchaotic attractor can be found and manipulated in the software package of
Nusse and Yorke (1991).

The neurobiological substrate for this system is the brain stem neuronal
modulatory driving of on- going thalamocortcal oscillatory brain waves (once called
“recruitment waves” in the 7-14 Hz, 6 to a, day dreaming to quiet alert range) and
as perturbed by multifrequency driving in what was once called “reticular formation
arousal” are realized as dominant EEG modes and associated states of perceptual
acuity and consciousness (Moruzzi and Magoun 1949; Moruzzi, 1960; Klemm,
1990; Steriade and McCarley, 1990; Contreras et al, 1997). In addition to intrinsic

its entirety. Accordingly it should be summarily denied as

moot.

This motion should also be denied because it advances

the exact same arguments defendant advanced in her summary

judgment motion. She is seeking rehearing on her summary
judgment motion, dressed up as a motion in limine. Many courts
in this district have summarily denied motions in limine that

seek to relitigate arguments from summary judgment, and I have

listed six such cases on pages 7 and 8 of our response in

opposition. You ordered nine defendant's motions for summary

judgment. This Court rejects the argument that she should have

partial summary judgment on the January 4th statement. The

Ww

last sentence of that order states, Because of the existence

of triable issues of material fact rather than opinion and

because the prelitigation privilege is inapplicable, the motion

for summary judgment is denied. Defendant's reiteration of

her defamatory press release confirming it two days later is

something that this Court did not rule that that is not
actionable. So she's seeking rehearing.
Also importantly, your Honor, Ms. Giuffre opposed

summary judgment on defendant's defamation in its entirety.

She opposed the motion for summary judgment in its entirety,

and this statement, as part and parcel of defendant's
defamation and part and parcel of defendant's motion for

summary judgment.

IV) and coma (advanced Jakob-Creutzfeld disease), suggesting that level of

consciousness correlated positively with amount of orbital divergence (Gallez and
Bablioyantz, 1991). A “pathologically low’ leading 4(+)was also found to be

characteristic of the EEG of patients with Alzheimer’s syndromes (Jeong et al,

1998). Technically defined sleep stages (I, Il, Ill, IV, REM) were found to correlate
well with the values of the leading 4(+) of the EEG in normal subjects (Fell et al,

1993; 1996; Pradhan and Sadasivan, 1996). EEG recordings during problem

solving sometimes, but not always, demonstrated a relationship between values of
A(+) and the kind or amount of load of the task (Micheloyannis et al, 1998;
Popivanovov et al, 1998; Meyer-Lindenberg et al, 1998). Both emotionally positive
and negative videos increased the value of the leading 4(+) (Aftanos et al, 1997) as

did computer generated music with sounds that exploited a “pleasing” hierarchical,
1/f but not an “unpleasant” 1/f 7 frequency spectrum (see previous section about

power law scaling) (Jeong et al, 1998). The EEG theta rhythm of “day dreaming”
manifested a lower 4(+) than the “relaxed alert awake” alpha rhythm (Roschke et al,

1997). Relationships between the Lyapounov spectra demonstrated both regional
independence and task-related dependence in the magnetoencephalography record
in man (Kowalik and Elbert, 1995).

These and other studies suggest that divergence rate of orbits on a
geometrically reconstructed attractor is a subtle measure, which can be quantified
as a continuous variable and which has been found to be useful in a variety of
neuroscience-related, experimental contexts. The range’ includes’ the
characterization of the discharge pattern of a single somatic or renal sympathetic

Divergent human populations often show very similar patterns of strong selection for
genes though different in time--thus Europe and Yoruba-land showed similar peaks in

parasite resistant selection, though 10,000 years ago in the former and 8500 in the latter

Incidentally very striking that cases of strong outbreeding, e.g between sapiens and
neanderthalensis resulted in us acquiring ~3% of our genome from them, half were local-

Likewise interbreeding between ‘us' and Denisovens in Tibet helped us acquire alleles

Logic is obvious--if you are moving into Europe for the first time you are adapted to the
parasites from which you came (malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, this that and the third

construction consultants bill payers, home mgmt.,vast multitude of Ilc's , including foreign, and with
all that you only have a combined overhead of less that 3 million dollars.

I have previously sent you the very same note that 1 have enclosed again below ,this time with

have been raised as one of your concerns , as aruleI try to memorialize things in writing in an

is weak for debt/GDP ratios below a threshold of 90 percent of GDP. Above 90 percent, median growth rates fall by one percent, and average growth falls considerably more. . We
note that while Reinhart and Rogoff's observations are based on ‘gross debt’ data, in the U.S., debt held by the public is closer to the European countries’ definition of government

Yet despite Entebbe, the trauma of the Yom Kippur War, and the cracks it
had shaken loose in Israeli society and politics, were yet to play themselves out.
The hostage rescue was like a sugar rush, an intoxicating reminder that the army
still had the capacity for initiative and precision, audacity and quick-fire victory
— like our air strikes in the first hours of the 1967 War. But the rea/ reckoning
over 1973 was about to come. It would change Israel beyond recognition, with
repercussions still being felt today. It would dramatically alter the course of my
life as well.

I still remember the moment it hit home, on the evening of May 17, 1977. As
Nava and I watched in our tiny living room in Ramat Hasharon, Chaim Yavin,
the anchorman on the country’s only TV channel, was handed an exit poll from
Israel’s latest national election. He began with three words: Gvirotai verabotai,
Mahapakh. “Ladies and Gentlemen, a revolution.” For the first time since the
state was declared, Israel’s government would not be in the hands of David
Ben-Gurion or his Labor Zionist heirs. Our next prime minister would be
Menachem Begin, who had inherited the mantle of Jabotinsky’s Revisionist
Zionism. He’d headed its youth wing, Betar, in eastern Europe, and led the
Irgun Zvai Leumi, the main right-wing militia force before 1948. Lacking the
intellectual depth and subtlety of Jabotsinky —a liberal intellectual who, among
other things, translated Dante into Hebrew — Begin drew his political strength
from his powerful oratory, and a refusal to countenance any compromise in
securing what he viewed as the ultimate goal: a Jewish state in all of biblical
Palestine, from the Mediterranean to the Jordan River, with whatever military
force was necessary to secure and sustain it.

But perhaps Yavin should have used a different metaphor in his dramatic
election-night broadcast: reidat adamah, an earthquake. Begin’s victory, after
the loss of eight straight elections over three decades, was the culmination of
seismic rumblings which had been building for years. The big, decisive, shock
was the 1973 war. Yet this was not just because of the colossal intelligence
failure, or the myriad errors of our military commanders and political leaders. It
was the fundamental loss of trust in the cosy, self-perpetuating establishment
that had dominated all aspects of Israeli politics, society and culture from the
start: Palmachniks like Rabin and Dado; political players like Golda and
Shimon Peres; Haganah veterans like Dayan and Bar-Lev; and, of course, the
kibbutznik pioneers. Almost all were of East European background —

Swedish American Group Focuses On Cancer, Autoimmune Diseases At Life Science
Summit

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.

“Part of this year’s conference focus was the current transformation of the HealthTech industry, driven by the ICT and tech
players rather than by the traditional medtech companies,” said Barbro C. Ehnbom, chairman and founder of SALSS. Also
significant, she added, was the participation of numerous women at this year’s summit, led by the keynote speaker Dr. Bahija
Jallal, executive vice president at AsraZeneca and head of Medimmune. “ We are proud and glad that so many prominent
women are actually SALSS women, including Dr. Jallal, which made this 2017 summit more exceptional,” said Ms. Ehnbom.

One of the little known companies that attracted a lot of attention at the conference was AVRA Medical Robotics, a
development-stage company based in Orlando, Florida, that has a new generation of “semi-autonomous medical robots for
image-capture, navigation, and tissue targeting.”

Specifically, these “medical robots” perform computer-assisted surgery, with human medical surgeons operating a remote
surgical device via a console. In fact, they are not really robots as we know them: AVRA has developed a novel and truly
robotic single-arms platform for the field of aesthetics, skin and wound care as well as dermato-plastic surgery,” said Barry F.
Cohen, AVRA’s CEO and founder. The company’s first design integrates software, image guidance, navigation and targeting
systems, to allow autonomous needling of skin, he explained.

“The future of surgery will be determined by success in gaining precision access to anny area of the human body with the
smallest incisions and deploying therapies to specific tissues, glands and organs,” asserted Alen York, an AVRA senior
executive. Limitations in conventional surgeries, he said, are demanding more autonomous, intelligent robot systems that go
beyond the capability of a human being.” AVRA’S platform focused on needling technology represents a key breakthrough
in aesthetics, wound care, and autonomous drug delivery platforms, integration of artificial intelligence and augmented
reality that will allow,” says York, for a new paradigm in surgical training, planning and treatment.

SmartwiseSweden AB is another young biotech that presened at SALSS. It has developed what it calls the Extroducer, a micro
catheter for injecting cells, biologics and small molecule therapy directly into organs. The tiny diameter of the Extroducer,
with the width of a hair, enables the needle to penetrate the blood vessel wall and deliver a payload via the smallest blood
vessels in the body, making perviously inaccessible regions now available to direct tissue projection,” said Jonthan Clarke,
CEO of Smartwise. Its product is the first of its kind of versatile device that allows for direct local injection of substances into
multiple organs, such as the heart, pancreas, liver and kidney.

“We have shown successful and safe pre-clinical delivery of insulin producing cells into the pancreas and modified RNA to the
heart,” said Clarke, who admitted that he is in talks with multiple major pharmaceutical companies for licensing or other
agreements to advance production. Smartwise is still privately owned.

ProLung, a Salt Lake city-based biotechnology company focused singularly on improving lung cancer survival, has developed
a breakthrough test with precision volume-averaging “bioconductive technology to collect data to generate a personalized
score indicating the likelihood of malignancy. With an estimated one billion people at high-risk for lung cancer worldwide, it
has the lowest five-year survival rate, or 16%, of all major cancers, and is the leading cause of cancer death, said Steven C.
Eror, founder, president and CEO of ProLung. The copany's test is non-invasive and non-radiating that reduces the wait
time from months to just one day, he added.

The test has received a CE Mark and ISO 13485” manufacturing certificate and is approved for sale in the EEA and EFTA
countries, said Eror. In the U.S., the ProLung test is still for investigational use only and undergoing multi-site clinical trials
for FDA clearance as a “510(k) device,” he added.

Because the annual SALSS coference has attracted exerts worldwiude, it has become a central focus for life science companies
to present and exhibit their new products or novel technology to a growing number of medical and scientific experts looking
for the next breakthrough product in life sciences.

A Formal Model of Intelligent Agents

7.1 Introduction

The artificial intelligence field is full of sophisticated mathematical models and equations, but
most of these are highly specialized in nature — e.g. formalizations of particular logic systems,
analyzes of the dynamics of specific sorts of neural nets, etc. On the other hand, a number of
highly general models of intelligent systems also exist, including Hutter’s recent formalization
of universal intelligence [[ut05] and a large body of work in the disciplines of systems science
and cybernetics — but these have tended not to yield many specific lessons useful for engineering
AGI systems, serving more as conceptual models in mathematical form.

It would be fantastic to have a mathematical theory bridging these extremes — a real general
theory of general intelligence, allowing the derivation and analysis of specific structures and
processes playing a role in practical AGI systems, from broad mathematical models of general
intelligence in various situations and under various constraints. However, the path to such a
theory is not entirely clear at present; and, as valuable as such a theory would be, we don’t
believe such a thing to be necessary for creating advanced AGI. One possibility is that the
development of such a theory will occur contemporaneously and synergetically with the advent
of practical AGI technology.

Lacking a mature, pragmatically useful general theory of general intelligence, however, we
have still found it valuable to articulate certain theoretical ideas about the nature of general
intelligence, with a level of rigor a bit greater than the wholly informal discussions of the previous
chapters. The chapters in this section of the book articulate some ideas we have developed in
pursuit of a general theory of general intelligence; ideas that, even in their current relatively
undeveloped form, have been very helpful in guiding our concrete work on the CogPrime design.

This chapter presents a more formal version of the notion of intelligence as “achieving complex
goals in complex environments,” based on a formal model of intelligent agents. These formal-
izations of agents and intelligence will be used in later chapters as a foundation for formalizing
other concepts like inference and cognitive synergy. Chapters 8 and 9 pursue the notion of cog-
nitive synergy a little more thoroughly than was done in previous chapters. Chapter 10 sketches
a general theory of general intelligence using tools from category theory — not bringing it to the
level where one can use it to derive specific AGI algorithms and structures; but still, presenting
ideas that will be helpful in interpreting and explaining specific aspects of the CogPrime design
in Part 2. Finally, Appendix ?? explores an additional theoretical direction, in which the mind
of an intelligent system is viewed in terms of certain curved spaces — a novel way of thinking

embodied, perspectival engagement. Our consciousness is electrically (cybernetically)
enmeshed, yet we don’t respond as if this human-generated set of elegant simulations had
its own intelligence.

The artistic use of cybernetic beings also reminds us that consciousness itself is
not just “in here.” It is streaming in and out, harmonizing those sensory, scintillating
signals. Mind happens well outside the limits of the cranium (and its simulacrum, the
“motherboard”). In Mary Catherine Bateson’s paraphrase of her father Gregory’s
second-order cybernetics, mind is material “not necessarily defined by a boundary such
as an envelope of skin.”°! Parreno pairs the simulations of art with the simulations of
mathematics to force the Wiener-like point that any such model is not, by itself, just like
life. Models are just that—parts of signaling systems constituting “intelligence” only
when their creaturely counterparts engage them in lively meaning making.
Contemporary AI has talked itself into a corner by instrumentalizing and particularizing
tasks and subroutines, confusing these drills with actual wisdom. The brief cultural
history offered here reminds us that views of data as intelligence, digital nets as “neural,”
or isolated individuals as units of life, were alien even to Conway’s brute simulation.

We can stigmatize the stubborn arrogance of current AI as “right cybernetics,” the
path that led to current automated weapons systems, Uber’s ill-disguised hostility to
human workers, and the capitalist dreams of Google. Now we must turn back to left
cybernetics—theoretical biologists and anthropologists engaged with a trans-species
understanding of intelligent systems. Gregory Bateson’s observation that corporations
merely simulate “aggregates of parts of persons,” with profit-maximizing decisions cut
off from “wider and wiser parts of the mind,” has never been more timely.*”

The cybernetic epistemology offered here suggests a new approach. The
individual mind is immanent, not only in the body but also in pathways outside the body,
and there is a larger Mind, of which the individual mind is only a subsystem. This larger
Mind, Bateson holds, is comparable to God, and is perhaps what some people mean by
“God,” but it is still immanent in the total interconnected social system and planetary
ecology. This is not the collective delusion of an exterior “God” who speaks from
outside human consciousness (this long-seated monotheistic conceit, Bateson suggests,
leads to views of nature and environment as also outside the “individual” human,
rendering them as “gifts to exploit”). Rather, Bateson’s “God” is a placeholder for our
evanescent experience of interacting consciousness-in-the-world: larger Mind as a result
of inputs and actions that then become inputs for other actions in concert with other
entities—webs of symbiotic relationships that form patterns we need urgently to sense
and harmonize with.°?

From Tsai in the 1970s to Hershman Leeson in the 1990s to Parreno in 2014,
artists have been critiquing right cybernetics and plying alternative, embodied,
environmental experiences of “artificial” intelligence. Their artistic use of cybernetic
beings offers the wisdom of symbionts experienced in the kinds of poeisis that can be
achieved in this world: rhythms of signals and intuitive actions that produce the

reconciliation. It is a real fun show.

Mommy and Daddy live in New York State. To get a divorce there,
one of them has to commit adultery. Daddy has a tryst with a girl. Mommy
raids the joint. She brings along a photographer. Mommy has secretly
been having an affair with the photographer. What Daddy doesn’ t know
won’ t hurt him. He always wanted to be on Page 3 of the Daily News
anyhow. Mommy made sure that his undershorts were ironed.

Benjamin Brenner lives in Brooklyn. He is a Supreme Court Justice
there. He makes decisions. He decided that raiding the joint is illegal from
now on. Unless you have a search warrant. Then it’ s legal, but you have
to knock first and say, “Benny sent me.” This new rule doesn’ t count for
hotel rooms. Then it’ s okay to raid the joint. So Daddy better get his own
apartment. Judge Brenner is really under the thumb of real-estate agents.

There is another way. Mommy can go to Reno. She lives there for six
weeks. That is called “establishing residence.” Reno is Keno but Alabama
is Clamor. Same-day service. The Chamber of Commerce invites lawyers to
practice there. They are promised the run of the divorce mill. More people

Foreign Policy

Barack Obama's Foreign Policy

November 16, 2011

Foreign-policy credentials: As president, Obama has taken on a
number of major foreign-policy initiatives, including a renewed troop
surge in Afghanistan, the negotiation of the New START nuclear
arms reduction treaty with Russia, the NATO intervention in Libya,
the withdrawal from Iraq, ongoing trade negotiations with China, and
of course, the killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.

Overview: Obama is a much different candidate today from the
senator who distinguished himself by his opposition to the dumb
war on his way to the presidency in 2008. Obama has turned out, in
many ways, to have pursued a fairly conventional, at times, hawkish
foreign policy. He has had some notable successes, such as the bin
Laden raid and this year's withdrawal from Iraq -- albeit on a
timetable negotiated by his predecessor -- and the successful
overthrow of Muammar al-Qaddafi. All the same, apology tours
and leading from behind -- referring to an unfortunate description
of Obama's diplomatic strategy by a White House staffer -- have
already become buzzwords for Republican candidates. He has also
faced heavy criticism on the left for a sometimes inconsistent
approach to international law in counterterrorism operations.

But with a significant economic recovery appearing unlikely and
fewer domestic achievements to point to than he might have
expected, coupled with the international inexperience of his
opponents, Obama may make his foreign-policy wins the centerpiece
of his reelection strategy.

minister announced on Feb. 5 the result of
his country's investigation into the July
2012 bombing of a bus filled with Israeli
tourists in the city of Burgas, which killed
five Israelis and the vehicle's Bulgarian
driver. Two of the individuals who carried
out the terrorist attack, he said, belonged
to the military formation of Hezbollah.

It was not by chance that his statement
fingered only the military wing of
Hezbollah, not the group as a whole.
Within the European Union, the findings of
the Bulgarian investigation have kicked off
a firestorm over whether to add the
Lebanese militant organization -- in whole,
or perhaps just its military or terrorist
wings -- to the EU's list of banned terrorist
groups. But are there in fact distinct wings
within the self-styled Party of God?

Hezbollah is many things. It is one of the
dominant political parties in Lebanon, as
well as a social and religious movement
catering first and foremost -- though not
exclusively -- to Lebanon's Shiite
community. Hezbollah is also Lebanon's
largest militia, the only one to keep its
weapons and rebrand its armed elements as
an Islamic resistance in response to the
terms of the 1989 Taif Accord, which
ended the Lebanese Civil War.

intended to complement one another, the

winner of the popular vote in each state or their own calculations as to who is best for America?
Precedent suggests that delegations use secret ballots, which means individual lawmakers may vote their

consciences.

If we recruit this ideal candidate; threading the needle of name ID, a center-left bent, a TV- savvy
campaign team and a pledge to serve only four years with an apartisan agenda, money and campaign
expertise would certainly follow. And 50 state ballot access is a function of time (starting in the fall of
2019 would be prudential) and hard work as we have discussed and many of you have exhaustively war-

gamed.

Part and parcel of this effort would be motivating the often politically lackadaisical middle to vote. The
raft of new technologies in data targeting and biometric mobile voting technology could transform the
electorate in the next few, amping voter participation and injecting the voices of moderates (both in
political views and level of political interest) into the process. And any third-party effort must
incorporate advocacy for accelerated adaption of these all but inevitable voter verification tools. I believe

Silicon Valley could be game-changing allies in this effort.

I am sure none of us doubt that chaos could potentially be unleashed by jamming three viable candidates
into a two-party system. An election that ends up in the House of Representatives is an uncontrollable,
murky and ancient process. But might that be a less scary prospect than relying on the Democrats to

nominate a candidate who can beat Trump in 2020?

I look forward to talking more about all of our ideas on this hopeful project in coming weeks. Please feel

free to call me to discuss. Thank you for taking time to review this note.

prosecution.” No one had told me about deferring federal prosecution before this.

56. In 2011, two FBI agents, called me in Australia and then came to meet me. They
met me at the U.S. Consulate in Sidney. They seemed to be very professional and hard working.
I thought to myself, “Wow, these people will do the right thing against the bad guys and protect
me.”

information about others who were involved in illegal acts as well. I was aware that a false
statement to these law enforcement officers was a crime and I told the truth — giving them the
information that I could recall about the individuals they inquired about.

58. Epstein also trafficked me for sexual purposes to many other powerful men,
including politicians and powerful business executives. Epstein required me to describe the
sexual events that I had with these men presumably so that he could potentially blackmail them.
I am still very fearful of these men today.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014064.txt,"2014] CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS 85

More importantly, extending the nght in this fashion will not be
unduly burdensome for federal prosecutors. After the OLC memorandum
was made public, the Department amended the Attorney General
Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance to require prosecutors to
make reasonable efforts toward a goal of providing victims with a
meaningful opportunity to offer their views before plea agreements are
formally reached.'** “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur
before a case has been brought, Department policy is that this should
include reasonable consultation prior to the filing of a charging instrument
with the court.”'*° Thus, Department policy already extends pre-charging
rights to victims. The CVRA should be understood as having the same
scope.

OLC also notes that the CVRA right “to be treated with fairness and
with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy” is a right that could apply
before charges are filed.'!°° Indeed, OLC is forced to concede (as district
courts have recognized) that the “right to be treated with fairness and with
respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy may apply with great force
during an investigation, before any charging instrument has been filed.”'*!

OLC nonetheless maintains that the right to fairness only applies after
charges have been filed. OLC relies on the canon of statutory construction
noscitur a sociis, meaning that words are known by their companions,'? for
its interpretation of the CVRA. OLC argues that because the other seven
enumerated nights are limited to post-charging situations, the eighth nght
should be as well. Of course, this argument assumes that OLC’s
construction of the other seven rights is correct—a point very much in
dispute.’ If, for example, the right to confer applies before charges are
filed, then presumably noscitur a sociis would cut the other way—the right
to fairness should likewise be construed as applying before charges are
filed.

Moreover, OLC omits from its discussion of the fairness provision any
assessment of the CVRA’s purposes. In construing a statute, a court must
consider the “purpose and context” of the statute.°* In describing the
fairness provision, Senator Kyl emphasized that it conferred a “broad”

An interesting piece to read before you start your weekend. Guest Post by Jim Krane: Dubai, Not Obama, is the Mideast's Best 
Peace Hope Tuesday, Sep 01 2009, 3:11PMThis is a guest note by Jim Krane, a former AP Persian Gulf correspondent. His new 
book on Dubai, City of Gold: Dubai and the Dream of Capitalism, is available. 
As Americans, Israelis and Palestinians continue their endless peace-jockeying, a more hopeful solution has emerged. It is a fresh 
Arab initiative that depends neither on America nor Israel. 
It is Dubai. 
Dubai, you must know, is the flashy Gulf city-state that is one of the seven United Arab Emirates. In my book, I argue that Dubaians, 
descended from illiterate Bedouin who faced starvation in the 1940s, have authored the most exciting Arab accomplishment in 700 
years. 
From nowhere, Dubai has mushroomed into a trading city-state on the lines of Hong Kong and Singapore, with sidelines in real 
estate and tourism. 
Dubai accomplished all this without (much) oil, and without the help - or even recognition of the United States. While Washington 
has been caught up prolonging the Israel-Palestinian conflict and starting a war in Iraq, Dubai was erecting one of the worlds most 
spectacular cities. So, how can Dubai fix the Middle East? It certainly can't do much to help Palestinians suffering under Israeli 
misrule. 
But that is the point. Dubai has succeeded in spite of the plight of the Palestinians, and in spite of what Arab leaders describe as US 
meddling that stymies their development. One of the favorite themes of Dubai leader Sheikh Mohammed is that his counterparts 
should stop bloviating about the Israelis and start serving the interests of their own citizens. 
Dubai's wild growth backs up Sheikh Mohammed's message. His business-before-politics way is becoming a development model for 
the rest of the Arab world. 
But wait, Dubai is in financial trouble. How could it be a role model?Dubai's downturn is temporary. Being one of the worlds most 
globalized cities, it couldn't help but be infected by a global recession. The contagion kneecapped each one of its economic pillars: 
Shipping, logistics, tourism, and its binging real estate sector. Most of these pillars remain sound. 
Dubai's economic example isn't widely understood in Washington. But its a good thing. Emulating Dubai could make Arab countries 
more stable and secure, along with the rest of us. For America, which has mistreated Dubai despite synergies with our interests, its a 
windfall. 
If you remember, Dubai in 2006 bought US port operations and found itself vilified as a terrorist logistics center. Members of 
Congress now in the Obama administration -- among them the senator who is now president -- joined the Dubai-bashing. Well, it 
may turn out that this terrorist logistics center has one of the keys for fixing the Mideast's terrorism problem. 
The Dubai model is a mixture of social freedom, unbridled immigration, and raw capitalism. It is overseen by a government that is 
one of the world's least democratic. This is no accident. Dubai avoids both elections and the Arab obsession with politics, especially 
the syndrome of feeling slighted by the West. 
Dubai is pragmatic. It makes money doing business with Israel and Iran, countries shunned by other Arab states. The city's finessing 
of simultaneous friendships with Washington and Tehran is as deft as it is precarious. 
Dubai's government wrings efficiencies using schemes from Harvard Business School and General Electric. Its use of strategic 
planning is a new concept in the Middle East. Dubai conceives developments, like no-tax business parks, and builds them exactly as 
promised. 
In contrast with the surrounding police states, Dubai functions on the honor system. Alcohol is legal. Prostitution is tolerated. A nice 
example is the e-Gate scheme, which allows residents to use a biometric card to skip passport control. None of the neighbors has the 
confidence to replace state security with a smart card. Not Saudi Arabia, not Iran, not Israel. 
Saudis and Iranians, especially, find a refreshing dignity in Dubai, a respect for their ability to make the right choice. Friday you can 
pray, but Thursday night you might want to go to the bar, says a Dubai-based Saudi. It's up to you. Dubai is certainly taking risks. 
But rulers from Morocco to Iran are already Xeroxing parts of the Dubai playbook and waiting to see how the more controversial 
approaches pan out. For some, its a matter of self-preservation: Dubai's state-led development doesn't involve elections. For others 
its a bid to stop the hemorrhage of bright citizens and cash fleeing to Dubai. 
All of them ought to do more. Egypt, with its unemployed masses, could make use of Dubai's incentives for foreign investment. 
Syria might adopt its free trade ways. Iraq and Israel could use a dose of its religious tolerance. And its Gulf neighbors might 
streamline their bureaucracies as Dubai has. 
Of course, there are areas where neighbors emulate Dubai to their detriment. Dubai's abusive in-sourced labor market is one. Real 
estate is another. One hopes Dubai's property crash taught admirers what not to copy. And Dubai pays no heed to the environment. 
Thus Dubaians, with their monster 4x4s and chilled swimming pools, are the worlds most prolific polluters. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031423 
But overall, Dubai's self-help mentality is the best hope for dragging this stagnant region into the global economic mainstream, with 
the accompanying stability and peace it implies. Its time Washington took notice.-- Jim

Through the Looking Glass

There’s definitely a deep state. Trust me, I’ve been there.

—EDWARD SNOWDEN, Moscow, 2014

Wa WAITING to hear back from Kucherena’s office, I
arranged to meet with Victor Cherkashin, who had been one
of the most successful KGB spy handlers in the Cold War. Cher-
kashin, born in 1932, had served in the KGB’s espionage branch
from 1952 until 1991 and now operated a private security firm in
Moscow. I was particularly interested in his recruitment of three
top American intelligence officers: Aldrich Ames of the CIA, Robert
Hanssen of the FBI, and Ronald Pelton of the NSA. I hoped that see-
ing these intelligence coups through the eyes, and mind-set, of their
KGB handler might provide some historical context for the Snowden
defection. So I invited Cherkashin to lunch at Gusto, a quiet Italian
restaurant, located near the Chekhov Theater in Moscow.

Cherkashin, a tall thin man with silver hair, showed up promptly
at 1:00 p.m., wearing an elegant gray suit and dark tie. He walked
with a spry step. Because he had served in counterintelligence in the
Soviet embassy in Washington, D.C., for nearly a decade, he spoke
flawless English.

that Washington went to meet Tyson wearing little pink polka dot panties, rather than
Fredericks of Hollywood underwear, thus showing that she did not put on the kind of sexy
underwear that women wear when they are out to have sex. (He neglected to tell the jury that
Desiree's sexy underwear was all still wet from having been washed, and that her only dry
pair—when she went to meet Tyson at 2 o'clock in the morning—was the one with polka dots.)

Finally, Desiree Washington solidified her image as a totally non-sexual platonic date who only
wanted to go sightseeing with Tyson at two o'clock in the morning, by describing to the jury how
she responded when Mike tried to kiss her as she entered his limousine for the ride to his hotel:
he went to kiss me and I just kind of jumped back.

Thus, the jurors were presented with the picture of a zealously religious, young, naive virginal
type girl, who does not kiss, neck or wear sexy underwear, and for whom a lawsuit or media
attention were the furthest thing from her mind.

No wonder the jurors believed her testimony, in what was a classic she said -- he said
credibility contest.

We discovered during our investigation that virtually everything “she said,” and her family
corroborated, was highly questionable if not outright false. The Washington family did not hire a
lawyer to ward off the media as they claimed, but rather to do precisely the opposite—namely
to sell Desiree's story for huge sums of money. After the trial, Donald Washington, Desiree's
father, publicly acknowledged that he discussed movie rights with the very lawyer whom he
falsely told the jury he had hired solely to ward off the media. In an interview he gave after the
trial he admitted that he: I expected to get money from movie rights, that's where the money is.

It also now turns out that the trial testimony denying any contingency fee agreement and any
written document between the Washingtons and the lawyer concerning a planned money
damage suit against Tyson was categorically false. Immediately after Desiree Washington's sexual
encounter with Mike Tyson, the Washington family went to see a high-powered lawyer in their
home state of Rhode Island. The discussion turned instantly to how the Washington family could
parlay Desiree's date with Tyson into big bucks. They talked about movie rights, book deals and
multimillion-dollar lawsuits. The lawyer carefully explained what a contingency fee agreement
was and the family agreed with this arrangement. Desiree signed a contingency fee agreement,
which her father and mother officially witnessed. The family was given a copy of this document.

The prosecutor was fully aware of the contingency fee arrangement. Indeed, during the

1989 deposition he said that he put in only $300,000 of his own money. Where did the rest come
from? Hoffenberg has said it came from him, in a loan that Nederlander and Toboroff didn’t
know about.

Two things happened that alarmed Nederlander and Toboroff. After the group signaled a
possible takeover, the Pennwalt management threatened to sue the would-be raiders. Epstein was
reluctant initially to give a deposition about his share of the money, telling Toboroff there were
“reasons” he didn’t want to. Then, after the opportunity for new investors was closed, co-
investors recall Epstein announcing that he’d found one at last: Dick Snyder, then C.E.O. of the
publisher Simon & Schuster, who wanted to put up approximately $500,000. (Neither Epstein
nor Snyder can now recall the investment. Yet in the 1989 deposition Epstein said that he had
recruited Snyder, whom he had met socially, into the deal.)

According to a source, Toboroff and Nederlander told Epstein that Snyder was too late, but,
without their realizing it, Hoffenberg has claimed, Snyder wrote a check to Hoffenberg and
bought out some of his investment. But then Snyder wanted out.

“Nederlander started to get these irate calls from [Snyder,] who wasn’t part of the deal, saying he
was owed all this money,” says someone close to the deal. Toboroff and Nederlander were
baffled.

Eventually, a source close to Hoffenberg says, Hoffenberg paid Snyder off.

Just as Nederlander and Toboroff were growing wary of Epstein, he became increasingly
involved with Leslie Wexner, whom he had met through insurance executive Robert Meister and
his late wife. Epstein has told people that he met Wexner in 1986 in Palm Beach, and that he
won his confidence by persuading him not to invest in the stock market, just as the 1987 crash
was approaching. His story has subsequently changed. When asked if Wexner knew about his
connection to Hoffenberg, Epstein said that he began working for Wexner in 1989, and that “it
was certainly not the same time.”

Wherever and whenever it was that Epstein and Wexner actually met, there was an immediate
and strong personal chemistry. Wexner says he thinks Epstein is “very smart with a combination
of excellent judgment and unusually high standards. Also, he is always a most loyal friend.”

Sources say Epstein proved that he could be useful to Wexner as well, with “fresh” ideas about
investments. “Wexner had a couple of bad investments, and Jeffrey cleaned those up right
away,” says a former associate of Epstein’s.

Before he signed on with Wexner, Epstein had several meetings with Harold Levin, then head of
Wexner Investments, in which he enunciated ideas about currencies that Levin found
incomprehensible. “In fact,” says someone who used to work very closely with Wexner, “almost
everyone at the Limited wondered who Epstein was; he literally came out of nowhere.”

“Everyone was mystified as to what his appeal was,” says Robert Morosky, a former vice-
chairman of the Limited.

British readers — and you roll it once around the wheel of your car. The
small sweet will turn many times. Now put a pencil through the hole
in the sweet, jack up your car so the wheel is off the ground, hold the
sweet next to the wheel of your car and press the accelerator. The sweet
will spin round very fast and probably disintegrate in a shower of minty
sugar. This is the principle of gearing. A small circle has to do a lot of
work to keep up with a big circle. It’s very predictable. The sweet will turn
a set number of times for each rotation of the car wheel, equal to the ratio
of the circumferences of the two circles.

Gears usually have teeth to lock the wheels together, but this is really
just to make sure they can’t slip against one another when they transfer
huge forces, such as in racing cars. Some passenger cars have been built
with smooth gears; a friend of mine had one at university. If he put his
foot down too hard, the gears would slip, heat up and you would get a
terrific smell of burning rubber. If you were lucky you could leave the car
for a few hours and all would be well. But, if not, you had to replace the
rubber belt, which was very expensive. Toothed gears generally win out.

Toothed gears also have the enormous benefit of being digital. This
is quite important if you want to keep things accurate. Gears can’t move
a fraction of a tooth so if a toothed gear has ‘slipped’ forward a small
amount, it will be kicked back into position when it meshes with another
gear.

In a modern mechanical clock, a balance wheel swings back and
forth on a spring and moves the main gear one notch forward each time
it passes its central position. Gears divide this down to move the hour and
minute hands. If I put the hands of a clock at midday and let the clock
tick 86,400 times, the clock hands will come back to the same place. Once
you understand how a clock works you can play a trick. If you tell me the
number of ticks the clock has tocked, I can tell you the exact position the
hands will be in. To a small child this might be dressed up as a magicians
trick — but, of course, it is simply a matter of dividing the number of ticks
by 60 and then 60 again to calculate the amount of time elapsed. This
type of precisely predictable behavior is called deterministic behavior.
Something is deterministic if you can set it up in a particular way and
know the exact state later or, conversely, examine something and trace it
back into the past.

Modern computers scale up clockwork and make it much more
efficient; gears are translated into electronic logic gates and a quartz
crystal vibrates at 1000 million ticks per second to give us the clock tick.
On each tick, the computer can do a mathematical operation, store and
retrieve information, or branch down an avenue in its program. Using

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021061.txt,"Drilldown on USA Inc. Financials...

e To analysts looking at USA Inc. as a public corporation, the financials are challenged

- Excluding Medicare / Medicaid spending and one-time charges, USA Inc. has supported a 4% average net
margin’ over 15 years, but cash flow is deep in the red by negative $1.3 trillion last year (or
-$11,000 per household), and net worth2 is negative $44 trillion (or -$371,000 per household).

e The main culprits: entitlement programs, mounting debt, and one-time charges

— Since the Great Depression, USA Inc. has steadily added “business lines” and, with the best of intentions,
created various entitlement programs. Some of these serve the nation’s poorest, whose struggles have
been made worse by the financial crisis. Apart from Social Security and unemployment insurance,
however, funding for these programs has been woefully inadequate — and getting worse.

- Entitlement expenses (adjusted for inflation) rose 70% over the last 15 years, and USA Inc. entitlement
spending now equals $16,600 per household per year; annual spending exceeds dedicated funding by
more than $71 trillion (and rising). Net debt levels are approaching warning levels, and one-time charges
only compound the problem.

- Some consider defense spending a major cause of USA Inc.'s financial dilemma. Re-setting priorities and
streamlining could yield savings — $788 billion by 2018, according to one recent study*® — perhaps without
damaging security. But entitlement spending has a bigger impact on USA Inc. financials. Although
defense nearly doubled in the last decade, to 5% of GDP, it is still below its 7% share of GDP from 1948 to
2000. It accounted for 20% of the budget in 2010, but 41% of all government spending between 1789 and
1930.

Note: 1) Net margin defined as net income divided by total revenue; 2) net worth defined as assets (ex. stewardship assets like national

parks and heritage assets like the Washington Monument) minus liabilities minus the net present value of unfunded entitlements (such as

Social Security and Medicare), data per Treasury Dept.'s “2010 Annual Report on the U.S. Government’, 3) Gordon Adams and Matthew

Leatherman, “A Leaner and Meaner National Defense,” Foreign Affairs, Jan/Feb 2011)
(@)E) www.kpcb.com USA Inc. | Summary 439

...Drilldown on USA Inc. Financials...

e Medicare and Medicaid, largely underfunded (based on ‘dedicated’ revenue) and
growing rapidly, accounted for 21% (or $724B) of USA Inc.’s total expenses in F2010,
up from 5% forty years ago

- Together, these two programs represent 35% of all (annual) US healthcare spending; Federal Medicaid
spending has doubled in real terms over the last decade, to $273 billion annually.

e Total government healthcare spending consumes 8.2% of GDP compared with just
1.3% fifty years ago; the new health reform law could increase USA Inc.’s budget
deficit
- As government healthcare spending expands, USA Inc.’s red ink will get much worse if healthcare costs

continue growing 2 percentage points faster than per capita income (as they have for 40 years).

e Unemployment Insurance and Social Security are adequately funded...for now. The
future, not so bright
- Demographic trends have exacerbated the funding problems for Medicare and Social Security — of the
102 million increased enrollment between 1965 and 2009, 42 million (or 41%) is due to an aging
population. With a 26% longer life expectancy but a 3% increase in retirement age (since Social
Security was created in 1935), deficits from Social Security could add $11.6 trillion (or 140%) to the
public debt by 2037E, per Congressional Budget Office (CBO).

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028000.txt,"As we got closer, I could still see no sign of them. As dawn was about break,
I radioed Yitzhik to suggest he fire off a flare, but he thought that would put
them at even greater mercy of the Egyptians. Instead, he tossed out a smoke
grenade. We spotted it, more than a half-a-mile away, slightly below us and to
our right. I ordered us forward, leaving my second tank company behind for
covering fire. I led Company A, which included my most experienced tank
commander, Moshe Sukenik. Immediately behind us were our APCs, including
two carrying our medical team. My aim was to engage the Egyptian fire while
starting to evacuate Yitzhik’s men to one of the long, dry, irrigation ditches, 600
yards behind us.

We moved forward in a broad line with my command tank in the center. We
held our fire until we got closer. I still couldn’t see exactly where the men of
Battalion 890 were and didn’t want to risk hitting them. Only when we got
within about 70 yards did I spot the first of the paratroopers. They were in
groups of three or four in a thin line stretching 200 or 300 yards on either side
of us. They were lying behind whatever cover they could find: a bush, a clump
of debris, a small rise in the sand. Some were firing. Others were wounded.
From just a few yards away, Egyptian infantrymen were raking them with rifle
and machine-gun fire. They were now shooting at us as well, and we returned
fire. But the Egyptians, far outnumbering Yitzhik’s men, were spread out in a
network of foxholes, in some places connected by trenches. As we moved
forward, I ordered my APC commander to start evacuating the paratroopers
back to the irrigation ditch, with the support of a further group of courageous
reservists from another nearby APC unit.

A shell suddenly exploded 20 yards ahead of me. Others rained in around
our tanks. The source of the fire was straight ahead, about 1,300 yards away:
three SU-100s, Soviet-made World War Two “tank destroyers”. I trained the
main gun of my tank on one of the SU-100s and ordered the gunner to fire. I
used the battalion-wide radio frequency so the others would hear the order. But
when the dust and smoke had cleared, the SU-100s were still there. I ordered a
sight correction and said, again: “Fire”. Still, we missed. It was only then that I
realized why. Almost none of the tanks brought brought into Julis from the
maintenance units had included their “commander’s notebook” with their
checklists for calibrating and firing — a major problem, since many of the
reservists had last been in a tank years before. I ordered the gunners to use their
telescopes, parallel to the main gun, instead.

This corroborative evidence includes the location of the DNA in the room and on her
undergarments; the shoulder pain she reported to the doctors; the time sequence; the
absence of evidence that she knew who DSK was at the time of the encounter; and a
comparison between the two participants, in terms of their ages, appearances, status and
what each had to gain or lose by a consensual sexual encounter in that room.

When you consider the totality of the evidence and arguments offered in this case, I am
confident that you will have no reasonable doubt that the oral sex in this case was not
consensual.

After hearing this “mock” argument, many of the students concluded that the D.A. acted harshly
in dismissing the case. Most believed that this was a case in which both the woman and the man
had lied, but that the man’s lies were far more relevant than the woman’s on the issue of consent.

By any objective standard, the case against DSK was far stronger than the case against Mike
Tyson, since there was far more corroborative evidence in the former than in the latter.

Moreover, Tyson’s alleged victim was caught in a series of lies that directly related to her account
of the alleged rape and her motive for bringing the charge.

Yet Tyson was convicted and the case against DSK was dropped. Such are the vagaries of rape
prosecutions in which objective truth can rarely be established because when it comes to sex both

men and women often distort reality.

Male “Victims” Lie Too

Early in my career, I learned that men also lie, both as defendants and as alleged victims in rape
cases. One such case took place in Provincetown, Massachusetts. A young woman who was
related to an associate of one of my legal colleagues was engaged to a man and they were
vacationing together in Provincetown. The man went out for a stroll and came back several hours
later upset and disheveled. His fiancé asked him what happened and he told her that he was
invited to go on a boat ride with a group of guys and one of them proceeded to rape him while the
others did nothing to stop him. He described the rapist as a black man wearing a shark tooth
around his neck. He reported the alleged rape to the police who immediately issued an all points
bulletin describing the alleged rapist.

The police interrogated the alleged victim, who persisted in his description of the sexual
encounter as rape. His fiancé called my colleague and asked her to advise him. She sought my
assistance. We went to the police station where we observed the police interrogation of the
young man. As experienced defense attorneys, we soon became suspicious of his story, but we
couldn’t be sure.

My colleague asked to be alone with her client and questioned him about the circumstances of the
encounter. Eventually the young man broke down and admitted that he had consented to the
sexual encounter. He confided in her that he was uncertain about his sexuality, that he was about
to be married, and that he wanted to test his attraction to men. He was ashamed of what he had
done and didn’t want his fiancé to find out, because he was afraid it would end their engagement.

Some friends remember that in the late 80s Epstein would offer to upgrade the airline tickets of
good friends by affixing first-class stickers; the only problem was that the stickers turned out to
be unofficial. Sometimes the technique worked, but other times it didn’t, and the unwitting
recipients found themselves exiled to coach. (Epstein has claimed that he paid for the upgrades,
and had no knowledge of the stickers.) Many of those who benefited from Epstein’s largesse
claim that his generosity comes with no strings attached. “I never felt he wanted anything from
me in return,” says one old friend, who received a first-class upgrade.

Epstein is known about town as a man who loves women—lots of them, mostly young. Model
types have been heard saying they are full of gratitude to Epstein for flying them around, and he
is a familiar face to many of the Victoria’s Secret girls. One young woman recalls being
summoned by Ghislaine Maxwell to a concert at Epstein’s town house, where the women
seemed to outnumber the men by far. “These were not women you’d see at Upper East Side
dinners,” the woman recalls. “Many seemed foreign and dressed a little bizarrely.” This same
guest also attended a cocktail party thrown by Maxwell that Prince Andrew attended, which was
filled, she says, with young Russian models. “Some of the guests were horrified,” the woman
says.

“He’s reckless,” says a former business associate, “and he’s gotten more so. Money does that to
you. He’s breaking the oath he made to himself—that he would never do anything that would
expose him in the media. Right now, in the wake of the publicity following his trip with Clinton,
he must be in a very difficult place.”

According to S.E.C. and other legal documents unearthed by VANITY FAIR, Epstein may have
good reason to keep his past cloaked in secrecy: his real mentor, it might seem, was not Leslie
Wexner but Steven Jude Hoffenberg, 57, who, for a few months before the S.E.C. sued to freeze
his assets in 1993, was trying to buy the New York Post. He is currently incarcerated in the
Federal Medical Center in Devens, Massachusetts, serving a 20-year sentence for bilking
investors out of more than $450 million in one of the largest Ponzi schemes in American history.

When Epstein met Hoffenberg in London in the 1980s, the latter was the charismatic, audacious
head of the Towers Financial Corporation, a collection agency that was supposed to buy debts
that people owed to hospitals, banks, and phone companies. But Hoffenberg began using
company funds to pay off earlier investors and service a lavish lifestyle that included a mansion
on Long Island, homes on Manhattan’s Sutton Place and in Florida, and a fleet of cars and
planes.

Hoffenberg and Epstein had much in common. Both were smart and obsessed with making
money. Both were from Brooklyn. According to Hoffenberg, the two men were introduced by
Douglas Leese, a defense contractor. Epstein has said they were introduced by John Mitchell, the
late attorney general.

Epstein had been running International Assets Group Inc. (I.A.G.), a consulting company, out of
his apartment in the Solo building on East 66th Street in New York. Though he has claimed that
he managed money for billionaires only, in a 1989 deposition he testified that he spent 80
percent of his time assisting people recover stolen money from fraudulent brokers and lawyers.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028014.txt,"which, I soon verified, we didn’t — the obstacles would be enormous. Unlike the
Sabena jet, this one was a wide-bodied Airbus, and El Al had none of those in
its fleet. Even we could find a way to make sure a sayeret team got briefed on
the airliner, we’d be mounting an attack-and-rescue operation a thousand miles
away. And even if we could take out the terrorists, we were almost certain to
face opposition from the former army colonel who ruled Libya, Mummer
Ghaddafy. The chance of success seemed slim, the risks enormous.

Soon, however, Kuti’s question ceased to matter. Later Sunday night, Flight
139 took off again. Before leaving Libya, the hijackers freed a passenger: an
Israeli dual national, with a British passport as well, who managed to convince
them she was going into labor. We learned through her that there were four
hijackers: two Arabs and two Europeans. It was a PFLP operation, but included
members of the far-left West German Baader-Meinhof terror group. They
forced the pilot to head for the east African state of Uganda. On Monday
evening, it landed at Entebbe Airport, 20 miles outside the Ugandan capital of
Kampala and just a couple of hundred yards from the shore of Lake Victoria. It
was five times further away than Benghazi.

Yet with each passing hour, increasingly alarming radio and television
reports focused on the obvious agony of the hundreds of captive passengers. To
this day, I’ve never been able to establish why it was a further 24 hours before
we Started seriously to work out if there might be some way for us to free them.
Prime Minister Rabin was clearly asking himself the same question, however,
because on Tuesday afternoon, he called Motta in the Negev. It was now a full
53 hours after the hijacking, he said. What the hell we were doing to try to come
up with a plan? Motta was immediately summoned back to Jerusalem for an
emergency meeting of the government. As he was on his way back from there
to the Airya, Kuti called me back down to his office. “Motta just told them that
there is a military option,” he said, with a wry smile. Kuti had been a Haganah
officer in 1948, in charge of the Golani brigade, head of both the northern and
the southern command, and had known Motta for years. “That means we now
have to find one.”

I had just begun briefing a few of the analysts in my office when Motta
returned. When I got to his office, Kuti waved both of us across the hallway to
the big, rectangular conference room where general staff meetings were held.
On the side of the room was a globe. Giving it a spin, he said: “Nw, Motta. Tell
me, when you told the government we had a military option, did you even know
where Entebbe is?” Motta didn’t so much as crack a smile. “We have to find a

it has extended many rights to victims before the formal filing of criminal
charges as a matter of internal policy.'** This approach appears to be
workable, as a number of states extend rights to victims during the
investigative process.!**

A. A TEST FOR DETERMINING WHEN RIGHTS ATTACH

As explained in the earlier Parts of this Article, the CVRA clearly
envisions that crime victims would have nghts in the criminal justice
process before the return of indictments or the filing of criminal complaints.
The question then as to how much earlier in the process crime victims have
rights naturally arises. Does the CVRA apply one second after a federal
crime has been committed? Or does it apply at some later point during an
investigation?

This issue was nicely framed by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of New York in a securities fraud case. In the first indictment
underlying the case, the charged crime did not include various victims. A
later superseding indictment broadened the charges to include those missing
individuals. When they brought a suit under the CVRA, the court noted
that “[q]uite understandably, movants perceive their victimization as having
begun long before the government got around to filing the superseding
indictment.”!** The court, however, explained that there must be “logical
limits” to crime victims’ rights before the filing of charges.'* The court
noted:

For example, the realm of cases in which the CVRA might apply despite no
prosecution being ‘underway,’ cannot be read to include the victims of uncharged
crimes that the government has not even contemplated. It is impossible to expect the
government, much less a court, to notify crime victims of their rights if the
government has not verified to at least an elementary degree that a crime has actually
taken lac, given that a corresponding investigation is at a nascent or theoretical
stage.

The logical limits that the CVRA envisions could come from how the
Justice Department interacts with criminals during the investigation of a
crime. Crime victims’ rights advocates are fond of saying that victims
“only want to be treated like criminals”—that is, they simply want to have
the same kinds of rights as criminals receive, such as the right to be notified

ton, D.C., to Austria so that its specialists could debrief him on the
secrets he held in his head, it would have an even greater interest in
exfiltrating Snowden from Hong Kong to get, aside from his docu-
ments, whatever secrets he held in his head. If Russian intelligence
were willing to opportunistically accept the delivery of U.S. secrets
from an unknown espionage source that it neither recruited nor
controlled, such as Hanssen, it would obviously have little hesitancy
in acquiring the secrets that Snowden had stolen of his own volition,
even if Snowden had acted for idealistic reasons.

If Russian intelligence focused its search pattern on disgruntled
American intelligence workers, such as Ames, it is plausible that it
spotted Snowden through his Internet rants against U.S. surveil-
lance. Even if it had missed Snowden in Hawaii, a disgruntled former
civilian employee at the NSA would have received its full attention
after he contacted Russian officials in Hong Kong. While the tactics
of the SVR might have changed since Cherkashin retired, its objec-
tives remained the same. And the NSA remained its principal target.
Nor is there any reason to doubt that it still measures success in its

© ability to obtain, by whatever means, the secret sources and methods ®
of its adversaries. Snowden was in a position, with both the docu-
ments he had taken and the knowledge he had in his head, to deliver
the KGB such a coup.

9.3 Embodied Communication

Next we turn to the potential cognitive implications of seeking to achieve goals in an environ-
ment in which multimodal communication with other agents plays a prominent role.

Consider a community of embodied agents living in a shared world, and suppose that the
agents can communicate with each other via a set of mechanisms including:

e Linguistic communication, in a language whose semantics is largely (not necessarily
wholly) interpretable based on the mutually experienced world

e Indicative communication, in which e.g. one agent points to some part of the world or
delimits some interval of time, and another agent is able to interpret the meaning

e Demonstrative communication, in which an agent carries out a set of actions in the
world, and the other agent is able to imitate these actions, or instruct another agent as to
how to imitate these actions

e Depictive communication, in which an agent creates some sort of (visual, auditory, etc.)
construction to show another agent, with a goal of causing the other agent to experience
phenomena similar to what they would experience upon experiencing some particular entity
in the shared environment

e Intentional communication, in which an agent explicitly communicates to another agent
what its goal is in a certain situation !

It is clear that ordinary everyday communication between humans possesses all these aspects.

We define the Embodied Communication Prior (ECP) as the probability distribution in
which the probability of an entity (e.g. a goal or environment) is proportional to the difficulty of
describing that entity, for a typical member of the community in question, using a particular set
of communication mechanisms including the above five modes. We will sometimes refer to the
prior probability of an entity under this distribution, as its “simplicity” under the distribution.

Next, to further specialize the Embodied Communication Prior, we will assume that for
each of these modes of communication, there are some aspects of the world that are much
more easily communicable using that mode than the other modes. For instance, in the human
everyday world:

e Abstract (declarative) statements spanning large classes of situations are generally much
easier to communicate linguistically

e Complex, multi-part procedures are much easier to communicate either demonstratively, or
using a combination of demonstration with other modes

e Sensory or episodic data is often much easier to communicate demonstratively

e The current value of attending to some portion of the shared environment is often much
easier to communicate indicatively

e Information about what goals to follow in a certain situation is often much easier to com-
municate intentionally, i.e. via explicitly indicating what one’s own goal is

These simple observations have significant implications for the nature of the Embodied Com-
munication Prior. For one thing they let us define multiple forms of knowledge:

e Isolatedly declarative knowledge is that which is much more easily communicable lin-
guistically

1 in Appendix ?? we recount some interesting recent results showing that mirror neurons fire in response to
some cases of intentional communication as thus defined

A Grand Jury Session was requested during the month of February 2006,
in which all the girls that had been interviewed would have been
called to testify before the Grand Jury to seek an indictment against
Jeffrey Epstein. Due to subsequent meetings with the State Attorney's
Office and Defense Attorney Alan Dershowitz the Grand Jury was
postponed until a later time. Dershowitz had provided a package of
material on the main victims in this case in which they appear on
myspace.com and speak about alcohol use and some marijuana use. The
State Attorney's Office wanted time to review the material.

I requested additional subpoenas from the State Attorney's Office in
which I requested information from Dollar Rent a Car and Jet Aviation.
The information requested from Dollar Rent a Car was for the rented
vehicle by Alfredo Rodriguez while under the employ of Epstein for one
of the victims. The other subpoena requested was for Jet Aviation for
dates and times when Epstein's planes were in Palm Beach County.

I continued to research other names that were acquired either from
interviews or intelligence gathered during the investigation. I

billion in revenues generated by for-profit education providers in 2004 will increase to over $29.7 billion in
2010, 5.3% annual growth. 7° However, these estimates reflect only spending by institutions on
educational material and do not reflect the growing segment of direct to consumer educational materials,
which represented roughly an additional $20 billion in 2004.

Standards and Accountability. Due to the unsatisfactory performance of American students in grades K-
12, parents and lawmakers are demanding increased standards and accountability in schools. This
demand has focused on establishing guidelines for every school and every subgroup of students and
then holding the school (and its staff) accountable to students’ performance relative to those standards.
The Company expects continued focus on academic standards, assessments, and accountability in the
near future. Despite this increased attention on standards and accountability, many parents continue to
remain concerned with the overall effectiveness of the public school system and are increasingly relying
on for-profit education providers.

Charter Schools and Virtual Academies. There has also been a significant rise in the number of charter
schools in the U.S. in the past decade. Since Minnesota first enacted legislation in 1991, 40 states and
the District of Columbia have passed charter school legislation. Under the typical charter school statute,
an identified entity, such as the state, a state university or local school district board of education, is
authorized to grant a specified number of charters to community groups or non-profit entities to create a
public charter school. A growing number of charter boards, in turn, contract with private sector
organizations to manage the schools. In return for a large measure of autonomy from normal public
school regulation, the charter school is accountable for student academic performance. Currently, the
Company estimates that there were nearly 2,700 charter schools in operation nationwide, as of January
2003, with an estimated enrollment of over 685,000 students. Moreover, the federal No Child Left Behind
Act (“NCLB”) recognizes charter schools as a viable alternative for students who want to transfer from
neighborhood schools that are failing.

To capitalize upon the increasing number of parents who are willing to educate their children at home and
still want to be part of the public system, there are a growing number of virtual schools, where much of
the learning is home-based. Most current charter school legislation either explicitly authorizes virtual
public schools or does not directly prohibit them. Because virtual schools usually offer a comprehensive
curriculum, easy-to-use learning and performance evaluation technology assistance and instructional
materials, the Company believes that a growing number of families will pursue virtual public schools as an
attractive alternative to traditional schools and a more cost-effective, better organized approach to home
schooling. The large and scalable platform that exists at k12 is designed to capitalize on this trend as the
number of charter schools has grown on average nearly 13% annually, while charter school enrollment

of the earnings impact for the relevant companies, and assess what might be priced in by thoroughly
reviewing the Street’s numbers and commentary. It should also be noted that the same structural event
often affects not one but several companies, and the implementation of these structural changes are
typically not one-day events. As such, depending on the situation, we may have the opportunity to
capitalize on the same structural change event several times as it develops.

Our research process is our primary idea generator. We travel extensively and, collectively, the 5
investment professionals will have between 600 and close to 1,000 meetings a year as we speak with
companies, regulators, consultants, sell-side analysts and governments.

o = ©Why We Take a Global Approach - The “Greatest Gift”

Electron takes a global approach (historically, 40-60% of gross allocated outside the US) to the
utility sector: i) to spot structural change and resultant inefficiencies early, ii) to provide a wider
canvas to allocate capital around the globe to the most attractive (from a risk/reward point of view)
alpha opportunities and, most importantly, iii) to enable the Electron Global Funds to take advantage
of the global sector’s very low inter-regional correlation (i.e., correlation of regions within the global
sector; lowest of all MSCI global sectors — see below).

Source: MSCI, 7 years’ weekly trailing correlation

We call this very low regional correlation the global utility sector’s greatest gift to long/short
investors as it provides a greater return per unit of risk if one has the ability to dynamically allocate
capital to and generate alpha in all regions. There are few long/short global utility funds today given
the global utility experience required to capture the greatest gift, as different countries have different
utility market designs and structures.

The Electron process starts with a focus on structural change and we embrace the myriad of utility
markets’ differences around the globe because this approach leads to the most attractive alpha
opportunities and the benefits of the “greatest gift”. We allocate capital dynamically to the most
attractive alpha opportunities in the global utility industry. As a result, the Electron Global Funds is
only one fund, yet the “greatest gift” provides the diversification benefit of 4 relatively uncorrelated
regions and concentration in the globe’s most attractive alpha opportunities.

He’s sentence to jail in 2008 for 18 months and serves 13 (while Epstein is
now frequently accused of somehow managing to cut short his sentence, almost all
Florida prisoners serve only 70% of their officially sentenced time).

Jail hardly ends the legal catch all. Epstein's butler, Alfredo Rodriguez,
steals and tries to sell an alleged journal or calendar with Epstein’s activities—but
he tries to sell it to an undercover agent. Rodriguez is sentenced to 18 months in
jail on a charge of theft and of withholding evidence (it is not so much a journal as
a list of phone numbers, which were apparently collected or saved by Rod
Rodriguez; all of this stolen material was somehow subsequently included in a
court filing by Edwards). Scott Rothstein, a lawyer whose firm represented
additional girls in their suits against Epstein, also goes to jail for recruiting
investors to pay for these suits on the fraudulent basis that settlements had already
been reached. It’s the largest fraud in Florida history and Rothstein receives a
50-year sentence.

Then, Brad Edwards, Rothstein’s former partner, sues the federal
government in 2008 for abridging the rights of two of the original complainants
under the Crime Victim Rights Act (giving victims the right to be consulted about
the disposition of their cases) regarding the Justice Departments agreement not to
prosecute in favor of the state action. In 2014, Edwards tries to ad Virginia
Roberts, another of the original complainants, who has previously settled with
Epstein, to the long-running suit. Roberts who was paid a settlement under the
original terms of Epstein’s agreement—that he would pay attorney’s fees and not
oppose any law suits against him—is now trying to overturn the agreement under
which she was paid, and, with Edwards, further suing Epstein for $50,000,000.

Indeed, Roberts, with the Daily Mail being her prime outlet, emerges as the
most vocal accuser—and, in fact, the some total of the current story and attention.

That is, there is no story without her and what is being billed as her memoir
of her “sex slavery” with Epstein, written ten years after the fact. Along with the
Dershowitz and Prince Andrew charges, Roberts puts, with rather some narrative
detail, both Clinton and Al and Tipper Gore on the island—and in fact Clinton,
apparently with the acquiescence of the Secret Service, flying in a helicopter
piloted by Epstein’s girlfriend, an amateur pilot. Epstein’s lawyers say that not
only have Clinton and the Gores never been to the Epstein Island, but this fantasy
is easily disproven by dsecret service records, which would seem to make the
memoir opportunistic or hallucinatory fiction.

The FBI, in a recent filing, has argued that Roberts should not be party to the
suit against the government because she refused to cooperate with the government
in its investigation in 2007, hence has no standing as a victim. (At the same time,
the FBI included her on the list of 40 victims with whom it mandated Epstein reach

Finally, as you know, Mr. Epstein and the USAO entered into an agreement that deferred
prosecution to the State. In this regard, I simply note that the manner in which this agreement
was negotiated contrasts sharply with Mr. Sloman’s current representation that “/T]/he SDFL
indicated a willingness to defer to the State the length of incarceration...” See Tab 1, May 19,
2008 Letter from J. Sloman, p. 2. This statement is simply not true. Contrary to Mr. Sloman’s
assertion, federal prosecutors refused to accept what the State believed to be appropriate as to
Mr. Epstein’s sentence and instead, insisted that Mr. Epstein be required serve a two-year term of
imprisonment (which they later decreased to 18 months plus one year of house arrest). Federal
prosecutors have not only involved themselves in what is quintessentially a state matter, but their
actions have caused a critical appearance of impropriety that raises doubt as to their motivation
for investigating and prosecuting Mr. Epstein in the first place.

At bottom, we appreciate your willingness to review this matter with a fresh—and
independent—set of eyes. To facilitate your review, I once again request the opportunity to
make an oral presentation to supplement our written submissions, and we will promptly respond
to any inquiries you may have.

9.7 The Extended Mind and Body

Finally, Hutchins [Hut95], Logan [Log07| and others have promoted a view of human intelli-
gence that views the human mind as extended beyond the individual body, incorporating social
interactions and also interactions with inanimate objects, such as tools, plants and animals.
This leads to a number of requirements for a humanlike AGI’s environment:

1. The ability to create a variety of different tools for interacting with various aspects of the
world in various different ways, including tools for making tools and ultimately machinery

2. The existence of other mobile, virtual life-forms in the world, including simpler and less
intelligent ones, and ones that interact with each other and with the AGI

3. The existence of organic growing structures in the world, with which the AGI can interact
in various ways, including halting their growth or modifying their growth pattern

How necessary these requirements are is hard to say — but it is clear that these things have
played a major role in the evolution of human intelligence.

9.8 Conclusion

Happily, this diverse chapter supports a simple, albeit tentative conclusion. Our suggestion is
that, if an AGI is

e placed in an environment capable of roughly supporting multimodal communication and
vaguely (but not necessarily precisely) real-world-ish naive physics

e surrounded with other intelligent agents of varying levels of complexity, and other complex,
dynamic structures to interface with

e given a body that can perceive this environment through some forms of sight, sound and
touch; and perceive itself via some form of kinesthesia

e given a motivational system that encourages it to make rich use of these aspects of its
environment

then the AGI is likely to have an experience-base reinforcing the key inductive biases provided
by the everyday world for the guidance of humanlike intelligence.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019961.txt,"Theory 3: The Holy Grail proposition was that Trump and the Russians—perhaps even
Putin himself—had gotten together to hack the Democratic National Committee.

Theory 4: But then there was the those-that-know-him-best theory, some version of
which most Trumpers would come to embrace. He was just star-fucking. He took his
beauty pageant to Russia because he thought Putin was going to be his friend. But Putin
couldn’t have cared less, and in the end Trump found himself at the promised gala dinner
seated on one side next to a guy who looked like he had never used a utensil and on the
other side Jabba the Hutt in a golf shirt. In other words, Trump—however foolish his
sucking-up might have been, and however suspicious it might look in hindsight—just
wanted a little respect.

Theory 5: The Russians, holding damaging information about Trump, were
blackmailing him. He was a Manchurian Candidate.

OOK Ok

On January 6, 2017—nearly six months to the day after Foer’s piece was published—the
CIA, FBI, and NSA announced their joint conclusion that “Vladimir Putin ordered an
influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election.” From the Steele
dossier, to the steady leaks from the U.S. intelligence community, to testimony and
statements from the leadership of U.S. intelligence agencies, a firm consensus had
emerged. There was a nefarious connection, perhaps an ongoing one, between Trump and
his campaign and the Russian government.

Still, this could yet be seen as highly wishful thinking by Trump opponents. “The
underlying premise of the case is that spies tell the truth,” said the veteran intelligence
community journalist Edward Jay Epstein. “Who knew?” And, indeed, the worry in the
White House was not about collusion—which seemed implausible if not farcical—but
what, if the unraveling began, would likely lead to the messy Trump (and Kushner)
business dealings. On this subject every member of the senior staff shrugged helplessly,
covering eyes, ears, and mouth.

This was the peculiar and haunting consensus—not that Trump was guilty of all that he
was accused of, but that he was guilty of so much else. It was all too possible that the
hardly plausible would lead to the totally credible.

7 OK Ok

On February 13, twenty-four days into the new administration, National Security Advisor
Michael Flynn became the first actual link between Russia and the White House.

Flynn had really only one supporter in the Trump administration, and that was the
president himself. They were best friends during the campaign—buddy movie stuff. Post-
inauguration, this translated into a total-access relationship. On Flynn’s part, it led to a set
of misapprehensions that was common inside Trump’s circle: that the president’s personal

Radical Breakthrough Development Work 
• Research on each of the 13 episodes is ongoing and we are moving towards creating a short list of the top 
contributors per episode (with some contributors in multiple episodes). 
• We are aggregating the top contributors around 4 to 5 central locations, such as SF Bay Area, LA, Chicago, 
Boston, New York, Santa Fe, London, Oxford, and Cambridge for the main shoots. 
• We are creating a short list of locations for the secondary shoot - i.e. the more observational shoots on 
specific labs and research facilities, such as the Music Lab at McGill, the Sleep Lab at Harvard. 
• We are planning a recce in the autumn to assess locations and meet some of the key contributors.

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025192.txt,"now reproducible, non-controversial, and well-accepted among experts, although still not appreciated by the
public - hence the high value of our CTT TV series. The organizing idea is why and how are sleep and dreams
essential for normal memory consolidation and bodily health / well-being.

Memory Consolidation. There is a fundamental difference between REM and NREM Sleep for memory
consolidation: REM is for emotional memories, whereas NREM is for declarative and procedural memories.
Hence, understanding and dealing with REM emotional memories can lead to treatment for the many
neuropsychiatric illnesses that have sleep/dream-related disorders or syndromes (Parkinson’s Disease,
Anxiety, Substance Abuse, many sleep disorders such as Nightmare Disorder, etc., in addition to PTSD and
Depression). Research shows bi-directional causality between neuropsychiatric disorders and sleep disorders.
This is a superb example of how fundamental science breakthroughs lead to clinical breakthroughs. This fact
that REM is associated with emotional memories is nicely consistent with the apparent psychotic nature of
dreams, because in REM Sleep the frontal cortex is ‘down-regulated’ (and the frontal cortex is associated with
rational planning, reflection, controlling impulses), while in REM Sleep the limbic system is ‘up-regulated”
(and the limbic system is associated with emotions and feelings) — see Neuroimaging below. This is

why dream states flood the ego with emotional fantasies without rational control. However, it is also true that
the limbic system enables creative ideas, thus grounding in science the long-suspected idea that sleep and
dreams can enhance creativity.

As Dr. Robert Stickgold, our other advisor on the series, wrote: “It would be nice if we could talk about sleep
and memory as if there were only one type of memory and one type of sleep. But this is far from the case.
Sleep and memory each comes in many forms, and furthermore, memories can go through multiple forms of
post-encoding processing that must be individually addressed.”

Immunity / Immune System. Strengthening the immune system is now a proven product of NREM sleep.
Discerning the evolutionary basis for this is a key research project (1.e., it seems counter-intuitive

that sleeping facilitates fitness for survival in that predators lurked in the jungles and on the plains so that
going unconscious during sleep does not, at first glance, seem especially adaptive). Studies of sleep in various
non-human animals reveals a direct relationship between longer periods of NREM (Slow-Wave) Sleep and a
stronger immune system, especially in fighting parasites. NREM Sleep releases molecules that

fight inflection; NREM Sleep works for the maintenance, repair and activation of the immune system. (This
gives scientific rationale for the need or desire to sleep during illnesses.) Related are “genetic conflict” studies
with respect to REM and NREM, showing differences in heredity between material and paternal lines, and
differences between males and females in which genes get “imprinted”.

Neuroplasticity. Exciting recent research has reversed the century-long conventional wisdom that new
neurons are never created in adult animals/humans. The development of new neurons — neuronogenesis — is a
vital part of maintaining normal brain and mental functioning. New neurons are being created, importantly, in
the hippocampus (brain organ where new memories are encoded) — but, remarkably, the neuronogensis in

the hippocampus occurs only/largely during REM Sleep — a stunning finding. This is another reason why
REM sleep is needed for emotional memory consolidation (normal functioning).

Dream-Content. Although dreams have sparked human fascination and fantasy for thousands of years, only
in very recent years, have large-scale surveys been conducted with rigorous design, classifications and
statistical analysis. Literally hundreds of thousands of dreams are enabling statistically significant theories,
including cross-cultural analyses (similarities and differences). Dream-posting sites have revolutionized size
and structure of dream data sets. This enables, for the first time, longitudinal studies of dreams over time.
Patterns are repeated. For example, in general, the dreams of males and females differ in fundamental ways.
Males will engage in fighting with other males; females with both males and females. Male dreamers

are often the initiator of fights and the fights are usually physical. Females fight verbally. Aggressiveness
by the dreamer is almost always in REM Sleep, rarely in NREM Sleep. (Why is a continuing question.)
“Lucid Dreaming” is a new area of fascinating research. Lucid Dreaming is where the dreamer “knows” that

1. You’ve said that the women pressing suits against Mr. Epstein have lied repeatedly, and in
no way shape or form were they victims. They were at his place freely and voluntarily. And one
of them showed Epstein a fake ID. What do you have to say now that Mr. Epstein has
admitted in his federal plea bargain that he did conspire to entice minors to engage in
prostitution? Accepting that these women came voluntarily, isn’t Mr Epstein still guilty of
statutory rape?

2. Brad Edwards, an attorney who represents three of the women, recently served a
Subpoena to Testify at a Deposition on Epstein’s former girlfriend, Ghislaine
Maxwell. The Subpoena asks that Maxwell produce “a list of all girls” that visited
Jeffrey Epstein’s homes in Palm Beach and Manhattan, or flew on his

planes. Edwards said in an interview that Maxwell was “second-in-command of
Epstein’s criminal enterprise.” He added, “She was on Epstein's plane, transporting girls
for the purpose of having sex with other people. She kept a computer database of hundreds of
girls and oversaw the schedule of girls who came to Epstein's homes.”

3. A suit filed last May by “Jane Doe 102” against Epstein alleges that, after recruiting her as a 15-
year-old girl to give Epstein massages, Maxwell and Epstein took part in “sexually assaulting,
battering, exploiting, and abusing Plaintiff.”

4. The same suit alleges that Epstein “lured” the girl “every day for next two weeks” to his
house. The suit claims that she eventually became a “sex slave” to Epstein, traveling with him
around the world. “In all of these locations, she was required to engage in sex acts with him and
other women - including other minors.”

5. Did Jane Doe 102 — who now lives in Australia — go on the 2002 trip where
President Clinton flew on Mr. Epstein’s Boeing 727?
6. “Most of these acts of abuse occurred during a time when defendant [Jane Doe 102] knew

that the plaintiff was approximately 15, 16 and 17 years old and, after years of daily sexual
exploitation continued into her adulthood ... until she fled at age 19,

7. When Maxwell and Epstein celebrated Jane Doe 102’s 16th birthday with her, Epstein joked that
he would have to “trade her in” because she was getting too old for him.
8. Not only was Jane Doe 102 required to satisfy Epstein's every sexual whim, but she also was

exploited by Epstein's adult male peers. They included “royalty, politicians, academicians,
businessmen and others in various locations around the world.”

9. The Palm Beach Post and lawyers representing Epstein’s alleged victims have called his federal
non-prosecution agreement a “secret,” backroom, sweetheart” deal, noting that none of his
alleged victims was consulted. Several critics have claimed Epstein “bought” the agreement, using
politically-connected lawyers. Would he like to comment?

“T take a conversation at face value and move forward with it,” she defended herself. “I
put what was decided on the schedule and bring in comms and build a press plan around it
and bring in political affairs and office of public liaison. And then Jared says, Why did
you do that. And I say, ‘Because we had a meeting three days ago with you and Reince
and Steve where you agreed to do this.’ And he says, “But that didn’t mean I wanted it on
the schedule. That’s not why I had that conversation.’ It almost doesn’t matter what
anyone says: Jared will agree, and then it will get sabotaged, and then Jared goes to the
president and says, See, that was Reince’s idea or Steve’s idea.”

Bannon concentrated on a succession of EOs that would move the new administration
forward without having to wade through Congress. That focus was countermanded by
Priebus, who was cultivating the Trump-Ryan romance and the Republican agenda, which
in turn was countermanded by Kushner, who was concentrating on presidential bonhomie
and CEO roundtables, not least because he knew how much the president liked them (and,
as Bannon pointed out, because Kushner himself liked them). And instead of facing the
inherent conflicts in each strategy, the three men recognized that the conflicts were largely
irresolvable and avoided facing that fact by avoiding each other.

Each man had, in his own astute fashion, found his own way to appeal to the president
and to communicate with him. Bannon offered a rousing fuck-you show of force; Priebus
offered flattery from the congressional leadership; Kushner offered the approval of blue-
chip businessmen. So strong were these particular appeals that the president typically
preferred not to distinguish among them. They were all exactly what he wanted from the
presidency, and he didn’t understand why he couldn’t have them all. He wanted to break
things, he wanted a Republican Congress to give him bills to sign, and he wanted the love
and respect of New York machers and socialites. Some inside the White House perceived
that Bannon’s EOs were meant to be a workaround in response to Priebus’s courtship of
the party, and that Kushner’s CEOs were appalled by Bannon’s EOs and resistant to much
of the Republican agenda. But if the president understood this, it did not particularly
trouble him.

Having achieved something like executive paralysis within the first month of the new
administration—each of the three gentlemen was as powerful in his allure to the president
as the others and each, at times, was equally annoying to the president—Bannon, Priebus,

others.

Analysis or argument or PowerPoint did not work. But who said what to Trump and
when often did. If, at Bannon’s prodding, Rebekah Mercer called him, that had an effect.
Priebus could count on Paul Ryan’s clout with him. If Kushner set up Murdoch to call, that

real-world naive physics need to be? This is a question to which we have no scientific answer at
present. Our own working hypothesis is that the analogy does not need to be extremely close,
and with this in mind in Chapter 16 we propose a virtual environment BlocksNBeads World
that encompasses all the basic conceptual phenomena of real-world naive physics, but does not
attempt to emulate their details.

Framed in terms of human psychology rather than environment design, the question be-
comes: At what level of detail must one model the physical world to understand the ways in
which human intelligence has adapted to the physical world?. Our suspicion, which underlies
our BlocksNBeadsWorld design, is that it’s approximately enough to have

e Newtonian physics, or some close approximation

e Matter in multiple phases and forms vaguely similar to the ones we see in the real world:
solid, liquid, gas, paste, goo, etc.

e Ability to transform some instances of matter from one form to another

e Ability to flexibly manipulate matter in various forms with various solid tools

e Ability to combine instances of matter into new ones in a fairly rich way: e.g. glue or tie
solids togethermix liquids together, etc.

e Ability to position instances of matter with respect to each other in a rich way: e.g. put
liquid in a solid cavity, cover something with a lid or a piece of fabric, etc.

It seems to us that if the above are present in an environment, then an AGI seeking to
achieve appropriate goals in that environment will be likely to form an appropriate “human-
like physical-world intuition. We doubt that the specifics of the naive physics of different
forms of matter are critical to human-like intelligence. But, we suspect that a great amount
of unconscious human metaphorical thinking is conditioned on the fact that humans evolved
around matter that takes a variety of forms, can be changed from one form to another, and can
be fairly easily arranged and composited to form new instances from prior ones. Without many
diverse instances of matter transformation, arrangement and composition in its experience, an
AGI is unlikely to form an internal “metaphor-base” even vaguely similar to the human one —
so that, even if it’s highly intelligent, its thinking will be radically non-human-like in character.

Naturally this is all somewhat speculative and must be explored via experimentation. Maybe
an elaborate blocks-world with only solid objects will be sufficient to create human-level, roughly
human-like AGI with rich spatiotemporal and manipulative intuition. Or maybe human intel-
ligence is more closely adapted to the specifics of our physical world — with water and dirt and
plants and hair and so forth — than we currently realize. One thing that és very clear is that, as
we proceed with embodying, situating and educating our AGI systems, we need to pay careful
attention to the way their intelligence is conditioned by their environment.

9.5 Folk Psychology
Related to naive physics is the notion of “naive psychology” or “folk psychology” [Rav04], which
includes for instance the following aspects:

1. Mental simulation of other agents
2. Mental theory regarding other agents
3. Attribution of beliefs, desires and intentions (BDI) to other agents via theory or simulation

At bottom, Jane Doe #3’s Response is nothing but a paper-thin pastiche of conspiracy
theory and outright misrepresentation that crumbles upon examination. Invocations of the Fifth
Amendment by nonparty witnesses in response to innocuous questions about Prof. Dershowitz
are said to take on a “sinister cast”; yet these same witnesses invoked their right against self-
incrimination to almost every question asked of them, including their parents’ names. Prof.
Dershowitz, as Epstein’s former legal counsel, is one of hundreds of people listed in an address
book purloined by Jeffrey Epstein’s criminal butler; yet because Prof. Dershowitz’s name is
circled in the address book by an unknown person for unknown reasons, the argument is made
that Prof. Dershowitz must have sexually abused a minor. The record shows that while Prof.
Dershowitz and Jane Doe #3 are both separately mentioned in the flight logs of Mr. Epstein’s
private plane, they are never listed on the same flight. Plaintiffs, in turn, falsely claim that
somehow Prof. Dershowitz single-handedly orchestrated the destruction of logs without any
evidence of ability or possibility to do so. The increasingly unfounded accusations and insults
are both sad and irresponsible.

It is precisely this toxic mix of irrelevancy, malicious falsehood, and empty accusation
that justifies Prof. Dershowitz’s intervention to, at least, strike the allegations against him. Jane
Doe #3 never had any need to drag Prof. Dershowitz into this action besides to wrongfully use
his good name and international stature to stir up media interest in her filing. This is
impertinence, plain and simple, and it has no place in this Court. Prof. Dershowitz therefore
urges the Court to either allow him to intervene to strike Jane Doe #3’s defamatory allegations or
deny Jane Doe #3’s Joinder Motion so she is no longer afforded the ability to use the docket of
this Court to defame others without being held accountable and strike these allegations from the

record.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029560.txt,"Paul Keating explains as never before

e BY:PAUL KELLY, EDITOR-AT-LARGE
° From:The Australian
e October 22, 2011 12:00AM

WITH his panoramic view of world affairs sharper than ever, Paul Keating blames the current global crisis
on blunders by European and US leaders and warns that Australia must rediscover the keys to national
success.

Interviewed in his Sydney office, furnished in a style he calls the last gasp of revolutionary classicism, Keating's
new 600-plus page book sits atop his desk, an insight into his intellectual, aesthetic and political obsessions.

What has Keating been doing since he left office in 1996? He has been travelling, speaking and analysing the world
and Australia with undiminished intensity suggesting a man operating as prime minister-in-exile.

His idea of leadership is more philosophical than ever, more distant from Bob Hawke or John Howard. His focus is
the synthesis between beauty and reason and his book encompasses China's currency, the world malaise, Mahler's
Symphony No2 and broaching the republic with the Queen.

During the interview Keating talks, as never before, about his leadership concept. But he is doing something else:
explaining himself to a still puzzled nation.

The great changes in civilisation and society have been wrought by deeply held beliefs and passion rather than by
a process of rational deduction, Keating tells me. In retirement, his political inspiration comes from music and
beauty, not opinion polls.

There are signs he has mellowed. While ruthless with his judgments Keating is keen to support a struggling Labor
Party while addressing the source of its strategic demise.

The failure of the Rudd and Gillard administrations is the lack of an over-arching story, the lack of a compelling
story, he says when interviewed last week.

I'm happy that Labor took us through this dreadful financial crisis so competently. But they are not in the business
of teaching. And governments, to succeed with change, must be in the business of educating the community.

“Our Labor governments have failed to conceptualise the changes. We need a framework.

What is the framework? It is ‘Australia in Transition’ strategically and economically. That's the story we have to
present.

| think the Australian people are very conscientious. During the 1980s and 1990s we proved they will respond
conscientiously to necessary reforms. They mighin't like them but they'll accept them. But reforms have to be
presented in a digestible format.

| know that in the age of the internet, opinion and perpetual static it is difficult to get the message over. | accept
that. But the big messages have their own momentum. If we get the story of transition right then other things will find

their place.

“Our problem is what | call shooting-star policies. We have a policy on carbon pricing, on minerals, on boatpeople,
but they are not connected up to the big picture about Australia's direction and its transition.

The Syrian Time Bomb

Patrick Seale

March 28, 2011 -- While one war rages in Libya, another rages in
Washington as to the necessity of U.S. action there. Indeed, Defense
Secretary Robert Gates said as much this weekend, noting that Libya
was not a vital national interest. But if Washington is looking for
an Arab state in the throes of unrest, one that is key to its regional
and national interests, planners might want to pay more attention to
Syria, which is currently undergoing upheaval not seen since the
early 1980s. Syria lies at the center of a dense network of Middle
East relationships, and the crisis in that country -- which has now
resulted in the deaths of well over 100 civilians, and possibly close to
double that number -- is likely to have a major impact on the regional
structure of power. The need to contain pressure from the United
States and Israel, for decades the all-consuming concern of Syria's
leadership, has suddenly been displaced by an explosion of popular
protest highlighting urgent and long-neglected domestic issues.

If the regime fails to tame this domestic unrest, Syria's external
influence will inevitably be enfeebled, with dramatic repercussions
across the Middle East. As the crisis deepens, Syria's allies tremble.
Meanwhile, its enemies rejoice, as a weakened Syria would remove
an obstacle to their ambitions. But nature abhors a vacuum, and what
will come will be unpredictable, at best.

The protests started in mid-March in Daraa, in southern Syria, a city
that has suffered from drought and neglect by the government in
Damascus. The heavy hand of the ruling Baath party was particularly
resented. Because it lies on the border with Jordan, and therefore in a
security zone, all land sales required the security services' approval, a

who was a minor at the time, also gave a recorded statement as
part of that. We took her deposition, and they're, you know,

in my view, vastly misrepresenting the deposition. And you can

look at the quotes themselves, but she testified in great

detail about the activity at the house, verifying that what she

said in her recording and in the police report was in fact
correct. And she is a witness on our trial list. She isa

I’d start with his feet, go up to his calves, up his legs, buttocks, back, his neck, his head,
his arms, yada yada, and then it would be time to flip over, and some of the men would
want me to continue on massaging the front side of them and they would instigate me to
begin having sex with them or foreplay, whatever you want to call it.

JS: So routinely, these massages involved sexual activity. Is that accurate?

V: That is accurate.

JS: Ok. Let’s talk about the travel that you were involved in when you were on Jeffrey’s
private plane. Generally speaking, who were the passengers on the plane when you
traveled.

V: Well, Larry was the pilot, and then there was a short, small solid guy, I don’t know his
name, but he was a co-pilot, and then he changed and there was another guy brought in
later on. Generally speaking, there was always Jeffrey, sometimes Ghislaine, sometimes
Emmy, sometimes a whole bunch of other girls, sometimes famous people, sometimes
some politicians or yeah, just about anybody could fly on his plane. There was never no
any set routine who would come and who would go. It was an influx of people on
Jeffrey’s airplane.

JS: I want to deal with these things separately in order to respect some of the reservations
that you have, so I’m going to ask you who the people were that you remember flying
with Jeffrey on his plane when you were personally present without regard to whether
there was any sexual activity that occurred on the plane or not. So I’m not asking you to
implicate any of these famous people in improper conduct, but just tell me what the
names of the people are that you remember that you consider to be famous people.

V: Ok, there was Naomi Campbell, Heidi Klum, there was Bill Clinton. There was Al (?)
Gore, there was a whole bunch of models, I wouldn’t really honestly be able to give their
names. There was Matt Groning the producer of the simpons cartoon, Jack CCousteau’s
granddaughter a lot of interior designers, architects, politicians. I am just trying to think
of as many names as possible for you. Off the top of my head, that’s as good as I can get
for now.

JS: Ok, alright, that’s fine. And again, I am not implying by my questions, nor do I want
your answers to be interpreted as your suggesting that any of those people that you have
just identified were engaged in any improper activities on any particular flight, but I want
to talk to you now about what went on on occasion on the airplane. Ok?

V: Ok. It was a lot of the same thing that went down on the ground. A lot of times, it would
be just be me and Jeffrey, or me and Jeffrey and Ghislaine, or me and Jeffrey and some
other girl, sometimes Emmy, Sarah, and Nadia Bjournik. There would be sexual conduct,
there would be foreplay, there was a bed in there, so we could basically reenact exactly

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016969.txt,"THE RIGHTS OF MACHINES
George M. Church

George M. Church is Robert Winthrop Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical
School; Professor of Health Sciences and Technology, Harvard-MIT; and co-author
(with Ed Regis) of Regenesis: How Synthetic Biology Will Reinvent Nature and
Ourselves.

In 1950, Norbert Wiener’s Zhe Human Use of Human Beings was at the cutting edge of
vision and speculation in proclaiming that

the machine like the djinnee, which can learn and can make decisions on the
basis of its learning, will in no way be obliged to make such decisions as we
should have made, or will be acceptable to us. ... Whether we entrust our
decisions to machines of metal, or to those machines of flesh and blood which
are bureaus and vast laboratories and armies and corporations, . . . [t]he hour is
very late, and the choice of good and evil knocks at our door.

But this was his book’s denouement, and it has left us hanging now for sixty-eight
years, lacking not only prescriptions and proscriptions but even a well-articulated
“problem statement.” We have since seen similar warnings about the threat of our
machines, even in the form of outreach to the masses, via films like Colossus: The Forbin
Project (1970), The Terminator (1984), The Matrix (1999), and Ex Machina (2015). But
now the time is ripe for a major update, with fresh, new perspectives—notably focused
on generalizations of our “human” rights and our existential needs.

Concern has tended to focus on “us versus them [robots]” or “grey goo
[nanotech]” or “monocultures of clones [bio].” To extrapolate current trends: What if we
could make or grow almost anything and engineer any level of safety and efficacy
desired? Any thinking being (made of any arrangement of atoms) could have access to
any technology.

Probably we should be less concerned about us-versus-them and more concerned
about the rights of all sentients in the face of an emerging unprecedented diversity of
minds. We should be harnessing this diversity to minimize global existential risks, like
supervolcanoes and asteroids.

But should we say “should”? (Disclaimer: In this and many other cases, when a
technologist describes a societal path that “could,” “would,” or “should” happen, this
doesn’t necessarily equate to the preferences of the author. It could reflect warning,
uncertainty, and/or detached assessment.) Roboticist Gianmarco Veruggio and others
have raised issues of roboethics since 2002; the U.K. Department of Trade and Industry
and the RAND spin-off Institute for the Future have raised issues of robot rights since
2006.

“Ts versus ought”

It is commonplace to say that science concerns “is,” not “ought.” Stephen Jay Gould’s
“non-overlapping magisteria” view argues that facts must be completely distinct from
values. Similarly, the 1999 document Science and Creationism from the U.S. National
Academy of Sciences noted that “science and religion occupy two separate realms.” This

pulling him back. And that seemed to be a stall tactic.

Playboy model $1.6 million in exchange for her silence about a sexual affair. Trump’s
personal attorney, Michael Cohen — another RNC fundraiser — helped arrange the
settlement, Broidy acknowledged.

[RNC deputy finance chair steps down after admitting Trump’s lawyer negotiated settlement
between him and pregnant Playboy model]

Cohen is under investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan who are examining
whether he fraudulently obtained millions of dollars in loans and whether his efforts to
squash negative stories about Trump during the campaign violated election law.

Broidy’s business dealings captured the attention of investigators for special counsel Robert
S. Mueller III, who asked at least one witness about Broidy’s activities, according to a
person familiar with the matter.

Broidy’s attempts to solve high-level headaches for the Chinese and Malaysian governments
were first reported this spring by the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, which
cited in part a cache of hacked emails.

Broidy has said the documents were stolen by enemies seeking to ruin his reputation.

“This whole narrative is a fabrication driven by hackers who want to undermine me,” Broidy
said in a statement to the Times. Earlier this year, he filed a lawsuit against the country of
Qatar, alleging that it hacked his email accounts in retaliation for his allegations that Qatar
supports terrorists. A spokesman for the Qatari government has called the suit “without fact
or merit.”

The Journal reported in March that, according to a draft contract, Broidy and his wife, Robin
Rosenzweig, were seeking $75 million from Malaysian businessman Jho Low if federal
prosecutors dropped their investigation into a Malaysian state investment fund.

The Justice Department has filed civil suits claiming $4.5 billion in public money was
misappropriated from the fund, 1 Malaysia Development Berhad, seeking to claim a portion
of those assets. Last month, Malaysian authorities charged f ormer prime minister Najib
Razak with embezzling billions in public money from the fund.

Clark, the Broidy attorney, told The Journal that Rosenzweig’s firm had been hired to
provide strategic advice to Low, adding that “at no time did Mr. Broidy or Ms. Rosenzweig,
or anyone acting on their behalf, discuss Mr. Low’s case with President Trump, any member
of his staff, or anyone at the U.S. Department of Justice.”

The Times reported in April that Broidy had explored ways to force Chinese exile Guo
Wengui to leave the United States. The billionaire businessman had fled China in 2014 as he
was facing arrest for a range of charges, including corruption. Guo has said the allegations
were fabricated by a government that wants to silence him.

press campaign might unfold (publishers are more worried about being caught in negative media controversy
than they are of legal threats):

1) Little, Brown has made on the record representations to at least one well-known journalist that it was not
publishing a book by James Patterson about Jeffrey Epstein--possibly an effort to avoid inquiries about the
questionable nature of the book;

2) The actual author of the book, John Connolly, is someone other than the stated author, James Patterson.
Connolly is known to have developed an obsession with Epstein, such that, his longtime employer, Vanity Fair,
has refused to allow him to write about Epstein for the magazine;

3) Sources have confirmed for us that Patterson has had little more than a minimal consulting role in the book,
and that Connolly has functioned in every material way as the book's researcher and writer. We believe
Patterson's authorship of the book will not stand up to scrutiny. And, indeed, that the entire notion of an
extension of the Patterson franchise into nonfiction, as it has been used in fiction and children's book--
effectively other authors writing under the Patterson name—presents a host of journalism ethical issues.

with potentially disastrous consequences for the United States and its
allies and interests in the Middle East.

Denuding U.S. forces in the region to enable a pivot to Asia 1s also risky.
Nowhere else in the world is America more likely to deploy forces than in
the Persian Gulf in opposition to Iran, and nowhere else is it of utmost
importance that any potential confrontation be won decisively in the next
five to ten years than with the Islamic Republic.

Going forward, Washington must discriminate between Iranian behaviors
it considers unacceptable -- such as support for terrorism, hegemonic
ambitions, and progress toward nuclear weapons -- and those it can
tolerate. U.S. officials could open the door for negotiations by making
clear to Tehran that they do not seek regime change; the first step in that
regard would be to let Iran know that Washington respects it as a nation-
state and not a transnational revolutionary movement.

Finally, disorganization within the U.S. government and a go it alone
mentality have accounted for many of Washington's internal difficulties in
responding to the Iranian challenge. To alleviate this problem, all cabinet-
level officials must be in constant and complete coordination, devoid of
routine bureaucratic obstacles. In addition, the appointment of a senior
subcabinet official whose sole responsibility is Iran (or, alternatively, a
small group of officials in constant coordination) could allow the
administration to reorganize bureaucratically in preparation for this year of
decision.

THOMAS PICKERING

Discussions of containment policy typically imply accepting the Islamic
Republic as an inevitable nuclear power and using deterrence to deal with
a nuclear-armed Iran. Yet such an outcome would be disastrous for U.S.
nonproliferation policy, which is based on the notion that fewer nuclear
states means less chance of miscalculated use. If Iran attains a nuclear
weapon, other regional powers would likely follow suit -- clearly an
undesirable outcome for the international community.

Federal jury decides Middle East bank did not defraud Orange County entrepreneur<http://fw.to/aXv1QHI>

[Farooq Bajwa]

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030098 
A federal jury decided Thursday that one of the Middle East's most prominent banks did not commit fraud and 
steal technology from an Irvine firm that sued it for half a billion dollars in damages after their partnership 
collapsed. 
Orange County company InfoSpan had alleged that Emirates NBD ended a partnership for a mobile payment 
system because it didn't want to share revenue and stole InfoSpan's technology to launch its own service. 
The Dubai-based bank, in turn, denied it stole or ever used InfoSpan's technology. It argued that it cancelled the 
partnership because InfoSpan couldn't produce a working product and misled it into thinking it was an 
established company, not one with little to no track record. 
After deliberating for a day, the jury unanimously decided that InfoSpan did not prove its case of fraud and theft 
of trade secrets. 
InfoSpan had asked for $540 million in damages. An attorney for InfoSpan declined to comment on the 
possibility of an appeal. 
The verdict capped a two-week trial that involved dueling accusations of fraud levied by high-profile attorneys 
on both sides, including the former White House counsel to President Obama. 
At the center of the high-stakes battle was San Juan Capistrano resident and entrepreneur Farooq Bajwa and a 
mobile payment system that he said would allow migrant workers in the Middle East to send remittances back 
home through text messages. 
Bajwa contended that InfoSpan, with support from outside investors, spent $87 million developing the business 
and technology. 
To launch the system, known as SpanCash, Bajwa partnered in 2007 with Emirates Bank, which is controlled 
by the United Arab Emirates' sovereign wealth fund. 
It seemed the ideal collaboration for the Pakistani immigrant, who earned millions operating another Irvine 
company that manufactured computer components in the 1980s and 1990s 
The Gulf States rely heavily on migrants to work construction and other low-wage jobs, offering a ready-made 
market for SpanCash. InfoSpan aimed to allow migrants to transfer money back home far more cheaply than 
Western Union or hawala, a traditional Middle Eastern broker-to-broker money transfer system. 
A study from McKinsey & Co., cited in court records, projected annual revenue of $3.5 billion by the deal's 
fifth year, with InfoSpan receiving more than $2.8 billion in fees. 
But the relationship between InfoSpan and Emirates Bank soured and the bank cancelled the deal in 2009. 
A few days later, Emirates filed a criminal complaint in Dubai against Bajwa and a partner alleging that they 
defrauded the bank and misrepresented InfoSpan as an established business with a working technology. 
Two years later, InfoSpan sued in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana and alleged that its technology was working 
and that it delivered its source code to the bank on servers. Emirates ended the deal, InfoSpan said, to launch its 
own mobile payment system after stealing InfoSpan's technology. 
In court, an attorney for InfoSpan argued that Emirates torpedoed the InfoSpan relationship because it abhorred 
how much money it would have to share with the Irvine firm. 
They wanted SpanCash and they wanted the money, attorney William A. Isaacson said in his closing 
arguments Wednesday. 
Isaacson — a partner with powerhouse law firm Boies Schiller & Flexner, chaired by high-profile litigator David 
Boies — argued that the bank resorted to pure extortion in an attempt to get its way. 
As a result of the bank's criminal complaint, InfoSpan alleged Bajwa's partner, Larry Scudder, was detained at 
the Dubai International Airport and taken to a cell where he was locked in with 30 other men for 19 hours until 
he secured his release by turning over his passport. 
According to the lawsuit, Bajwa tried to resolve the situation but was told Scudder's passport would be released 
and he could leave the country only if InfoSpan gave up ownership and control of SpanCash to the bank. 
Six months later, the bank withdrew the fraud accusations and Scudder got his passport back, but SpanCash's 
reputation was tarnished and it collapsed, Bajwa previously told The Times. 
The bank disputed that it acquired InfoSpan's source code or used it at any time. 
Former White House counsel and an attorney for the bank, Kathryn Ruemmler, said that Emirates never would 
have acquired source code in a joint-partnership deal like the one reached with InfoSpan. She said such 
technology would instead be held by a third-party escrow company for the length of the partnership. 
In her closing arguments, the partner with global firm Latham & Watkins told the jury that Bajwa and InfoSpan 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030099 
sold the bank a bill of goods, arguing that despite promises to Emirates, the technology never worked and 
InfoSpan wasn't as big a company as it claimed. 
The bank cancelled the deal and filed a criminal complaint, not as a form of extortion but simply to regain the 
bank's money after it was misled and doubts grew about the character of InfoSpan's employees, Ruemmler told 
the jury. 
They concluded, definitively, that they had been defrauded, she said. 
Lubna Qassim, group general counsel for Emirates Bank, said in a statement after the verdict that Emirates 
Bank is gratified by today's decision and the opportunity to receive a fair trial in U.S. courts. 
Bajwa said the trial has taken a toll on him and he doesn't know his next steps. 
I am just beat up, he said.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016941.txt,"Social sampling, very simply, is looking around you at the actions of people who
are like you, finding what’s popular, and then copying it if it seems like a good idea to
you. Idea propagation has this popularity function driving it, but individual adoption also
is about figuring out how the idea works for the individual—a reflective attitude. When
you combine social sampling and personal judgment, you get superior decision making.
That’s amazing, because now we have a mathematical recipe for doing with humans what
all those AI techniques are doing with dumb computer neurons. We have a way of
putting people together to make better decisions, given more and more experience.

So, what happens in the real world? Why don’t we do this all the time? Well,
people are good at it, but there are ways it can run amok. One of these is through
advertising, propaganda, or “fake news.” There are many ways to get people to think
something is popular when it’s not, and this destroys the usefulness of social sampling.
The way you can make groups of people smarter, the way you can make human ATI, will
work only if you can get feedback to them that’s truthful. It must be grounded on
whether each person’s actions worked for them or not.

That’s the key to AI mechanisms, too. What they do is analyze whether they
performed correctly. If so, plus one; if not, minus one. We need that truthful feedback to
make this human mechanism work well, and we need good ways of knowing about what
other people are doing so that we can correctly assess popularity and the likelihood of
this being a good choice.

The next step is to build this credit-assignment function, this feedback function,
for people, so that we can make a good human-artificial ecosystem—a smart organization
and a smart culture. In a way, we need to duplicate some of the early insights that
resulted in, for instance, the U.S. census—trying to find basic facts that everybody can
agree on and understand so that the transmission of knowledge and culture can happen in
a way that’s truthful and social sampling can function efficiently.

We can address the problem of building an accurate credit-assignment function in
many different settings. In companies, for instance, it can be done with digital ID badges
that reveal who’s connected to whom, so that we can assess the pattern of connections in
relation to the company’s results on a daily or weekly basis. The credit-assignment
function asks whether those connections helped solve problems, or helped invent new
solutions, and reinforces the helpful connections. When you can get that feedback
quantitatively—which is difficult, because most things aren’t measured quantitatively—
both the productivity and the innovation rate within the organization can be significantly
improved. This is, for instance, the basis of Toyota’s “continuous improvement” method.

A next step is to try to do the same thing but at scale, something I refer to as
building a trust network for data. It can be thought of as a distributed system like the
Internet, but with the ability to quantitatively measure and communicate the qualities of
human society, in the same way that the U.S. census does a pretty good job of telling us
about population and life expectancy. We are already deploying prototype examples of
trust networks at scale in several countries, based on the data and measurement standards
laid out in the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals.

On the horizon is a vision of how we can make humanity more intelligent by
building a human AI. It’s a vision composed of two threads. One is data that we can all
trust—data that have been vetted by a broad community, data where the algorithms are
known and monitored, much like the census data we all automatically rely on as at least

tell us about the circumstances of your first meeting Mr. Epstein.

V: Ok. I was introduced to Mr. Epstein by Ghislaine Maxwell. I was working at Donald
Trump’s spa in Mar-a-Lago and I was prompted by Ghislaine to come to Jeffrey’s
mansion in Palm Beach that afternoon after work to make some extra money and to learn
about massage. She met me at the spa, and I was reading a book about anatomy, so I was
already interested in massage therapy as it was and not having any of the education or
you know anything behind me, I thought this was a great opportunity to work for her and
go. So, I went to Jeffrey’s mansion about 5 or 6 in the afternoon. My dad drove me
there. My dad worked at Mar-a-Lago with me, and he met Ghislaine and she seemed like
a nice, proper English lady, and she knows, I mean, you know, one time then _once
before I left to travel overseas, she just seemed really nice and like she would like to help
me out. So my dad left, and I had no problem getting home that night, one of her drivers
would take me back after my trial. So she led me upstairs, and into Jeffrey’s bedroom,
and past that is Jeffrey’s massage room, which has got his steam room and a shower and
a massage table, and there is actually an extra room that has, that nobody knows about it,
it’s kinda like a secret room and it’s got a whole bunch of decorative pictures of

Recently, Elie had quintuple bypass surgery. I had lunch with him shortly thereafter, and all he

Obama has made no big mistakes in a revolutionary environment, but no victories
either. No big bets other than surge in Afghan — which we lost; and killing Osama
which we won. Obama’s approach is to take no risk, increment into a situation and
hedge the position. No big bets. Maybe that’s right for these times but look at
Truman with Marshall Plan; in *73 ME war Nixon used it to push Soviets out of
ME which gave us 30 years of dominance in ME. Bush (I) pushed to integrate
Germany and Poland into NATO — huge bet and we won. Big bets come from the
top down. Not interagency BS. Before Malta summit, Reagan WH had given him
18 initiatives to raise with Gorbachev. 2 days before summit, Reagan decided to
pass them by cabinet. Held cabinet meeting and every time an idea was surfaced,
the relevant cabinet member tried to kill it until it had been vetted by his
bureaucracy. After three went this way, Reagan ended the meeting. Presidents
make big bets, administrations don’t. Here are some ideas:

1. Iran — next president will be forced to make a big bet.

2. Egypt — Importnace is clear. Our response has been pitiful. Small and
irrelevant. Obama is letting his team over analize and organizational
dynamics are pushing safe and no risk options. Only a president can
overcome organizational dynamics. Not all big bets are worth taking.

3. Syria — Pattern has been to hesitate and equivocate. Some of our allies are
joking that we will implement a no fly zone ... 10 feet at a time. We should
break the Syria - Iran link with the full force of the US. Slow and cautious
will be damaging to our interests in Syria and Iran.

4. KSA we should consider guarantying their integrity.

5. Iraq — NAM bring it towards a break up. Bet on Alawi

6. ME peace process — we need a big bet.

Incrementalism won’t work. Activities threaten our vital interests. No big bets can
succeed if the US has a policy of leading from behind.

Can you confirm if the following quote is accurate?

If anything, the unfortunate period he suffered has caused him to really think about what he wants to do
with his money and his time, and support knowledge,” says Krauss. Jeffrey has surrounded himself with
beautiful women and young women but they're not as young as the ones that were claimed. As a scientist I
always judge things on empirical evidence and he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've
never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were I would
believe him over other people. Though colleagues have criticized him over his relationship with Epstein,
Krauss insists, I don't feel tarnished in any way by my relationship with Jeffrey; I feel raised by it.”

idea for the software, I came up with the idea for the interface, I decided
where to place the boxes, and I chose all the colors, fonts and graphics. I
did all the creative bits!

So, now we know what programmers do all day. They create!

Origins of Software

Alan Turing first described the modern day computer in a paper presented
to the London Mathematical Society in 1936. He was not trying to invent
the computer. That was a by-product. He was trying to solve a puzzle that
had been troubling mathematicians for 30 years: The Decision Problem.

David Hilbert set out the challenge during a public lecture to the
French Academy of Science in 1901, marking the turn of the century.
Rather than give a boring lecture extolling the virtues of scientists, he
decided to give his audience a list of all the puzzles mathematicians were
stumped on.

Rather like the XPRIZE of today, he presented the problems as
a series of challenges. Sadly for the mathematicians of his time, there
were no million dollar prizes on offer, just a moment of fame and the
adulation of their colleagues. Each challenge was given a number. The
list included many famous puzzles; the Riemann Hypothesis, the puzzle
of Diophantine Equations and the Navier Stokes Hypothesis, to name
only three. A group of these questions were to coalesce into what we now
know as the Decision Problem.

The Decision Problem is very important to computer science
because it asks whether an algorithm can be written to automatically
discover other algorithms. Since all software is itself algorithmic you
could rephrase the question: Can software write software? This might
seem esoteric. But, if you are a computer scientist, it is an important
question. If we could solve all mathematical problems automatically
we would not need mathematicians anymore. And, since programs are
applied mathematics, the same goes for computer programmers.

Before you breathe a sigh of relief because you are neither a
mathematician nor a computer scientist, you should remember it is
possible to describe all knowledge using numbers. That's what your
iPhone does when it stores music. If everything can be represented by
numbers, then a fast-enough computer could use an algorithm to create
everything! You really could set Douglas Adams’ Ultimate Question of
Life the Universe and Everything before a computer and it would come
up with the answer — presumably extrapolating the existence of rice
pudding and income tax along the way.

you can get this idiot elected twice,” Nunberg marveled, you would achieve something
like immortality in politics.

But through another window, Bannon couldn’t possibly remain in place. He seemed to
have moved into a heightened state that allowed him to see just how ridiculous the White
House had become. He could barely hold his tongue—indeed, he couldn’t hold it. Pressed,
he could not see the future of the Trump administration. And, while many Bannonites
argued the case for Jarvanka ineffectiveness and irrelevance—just ignore them, they said
—Bannon, with mounting ferocity and pubic venom, could abide them less and less every
day.

Bannon, continuing to wait for his call to join the president in Bedminster, decided that
he would force the situation and offered his resignation to Kelly. But this was in fact a
game of chicken: he wanted to stay. On the other hand, he wanted Jarvanka to go. And
that became an effective ultimatum.

7 OK Ok

At lunch on August 8, in the Clubhouse at Bedminster—amid Trumpish chandeliers, golf
trophies, and tournament plaques—the president was flanked by Tom Price, the secretary
of health and human services, and his wife, Melania. Kellyanne Conway was at the lunch;
so were Kushner and several others. This was one of the “make-work” events—over
lunch, there was a discussion of the opioid crisis, which was then followed by a statement
from the president and a brief round of questions from reporters. While reading the
statement in a monotone, Trump kept his head down, propping it on his elbows.

After taking some humdrum questions about opioids, he was suddenly asked about
North Korea, and, quite as though in stop-action animation, he seemed to come alive.

North Korea had been a heavy-on-detail, short-on-answers problem that that he
believed was the product of lesser minds and weaker resolve—and that he had trouble
paying attention to. What’s more, he had increasingly personalized his antagonism with
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, referring to him often with derogatory epithets.

His staff had not prepared him for this, but, in apparent relief that he could digress
from the opioid discussion, as well as sudden satisfaction at the opportunity to address this
nagging problem, he ventured out, in language that he’d repeated often in private—as he
repeated everything often—to the precipice of an international crisis.

“North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met
with the fire and the fury like the world has never seen. He has been very threatening
beyond a normal state, and as I said they will be met with fire and fury and frankly power,
the likes of which this world has never seen before. Thank you.”

various places at various times, some when she was 17, some

when she was 18, some when she was 19, some in Florida, some in

England, some in New York, some in New Mexico. In all of those
cases, except Florida, the age of consent is 17.
I don't know what evidence plaintiff is going to

introduce about what sex she had, where, with whom, and her age

at that time because those sands have shifted dramatically
during the course of this litigation. All I can say, your

Honor, is, if she tries to introduce evidence that she had sex

at a certain place and time and claimed that it was unlawful,

your Honor will be duty bound to instruct a jury on what is or

isn't lawful in a particular jurisdiction at a particular time
in a particular place.

Your Honor, I would submit that motion in limine 16

dramatically on what plaintiff introduces during her case in

against her as party admission.

There are many statements over the last 15 years that

relate to her mental condition, that relate to her medications.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013910.txt,"Sherwood notices that the shirts are often hard to find on the competitive sites, all of which feature
dozens of products, and the shirts are either made in the U.S. (inauthentic) or shipped from France
(customers must wait two to four weeks). Johanna cannot find a “yoga for rock climbing” DVD, so she
is starting from a blank slate.

2. Sherwood and Johanna now need to create a one-page (300-600 words) testimonial-rich
advertisement that emphasizes their differentiators and product benefits using text and either personal
photos or stock photos from stock photo websites. Both have spent two weeks collecting advertisements
that have prompted them to make purchases or that have caught their attention in print or online —these

will serve as models. Johanna asks her clients for testimonials and Sherwood lets his friends try on the
shirts to get several for his page. Sherwood also asks the manufacturer for photos and advertising
samples.

See www.pxmethod.com for a good example of how I have created a test page using testimonials
from seminar attendees. Please note that it’s just a template for readers and not a live sales page. Free
how-to seminars as recommended in the Expert Builder are ideal for identifying popular selling points
and securing testimonials.

Testing the Advertisement

Sherwood and Johanna now need to test actual customer response to their advertisements. Sherwood first
tests his concept with a 72-hour eBay auction that includes his advertising text. He sets the “reserve” (the
lowest price he’ll accept) for one shirt at $50 and cancels the auction last minute to avoid legal issues
since he doesn’t have product to ship. He has received bids up to $75 and decides to move to the next
phase of testing. Johanna doesn’t feel comfortable with the apparent deception and skips this preliminary
testing.

Sherwood’s cost: <$5.

Both register domain names for their soon-to-be one-page sites using the cheap domain registrar
www.domainsinseconds.com. Sherwood chooses www.shirtsfromfrance.com and Johanna chooses
www.yogaclimber.com. For additional domain names, Johanna uses www.domainsinseconds.com.

Cost to both: <$20.

Sherwood uses www.weebly.com to create his one-page site advertisement and then creates two
additional pages using the form builder www.wufoo.com. If someone clicks on the “purchase” button at

the bottom of the first page, it takes them to a second page with pricing, shipping and handling “* and
basic contact fields to fill out (including e-mail and phone). If the visitor presses “continue with order,” it
takes them to a page that states, “Unfortunately, we are currently on back order but will contact you as
soon as we have product in stock. Thank you for your patience.” This structure allows him to test the
first-page ad and his pricing separately. If someone gets to the last page, it is considered an order.

Johanna is not comfortable with “dry testing,” as Sherwood’s approach is known, even though it is
legal if the billing data isn’t captured. She instead uses the same two services to create a single webpage
with the content of her one-page ad and an e-mail sign-up for a free “top 10 tips” list for using yoga for
rock climbing. She will consider 60% of the sign-ups as hypothetical orders.

Cost to both: <$0.

Both set up simple Google Adwords campaigns with 50-100 search terms to simultaneously test
headlines while driving traffic to their pages. Their daily budget limits are set at $50 per day. (At this
segue into PPC testing, I recommend you first visit www.adwords/google.com/onlinebusiness and then
follow along by creating your own account, which should take about 10 minutes. It would be a waste of
rain forests to use ten pages to explain terms that can be understood at a glance online.)

or phone lines more freely if Snowden had not divulged the NSA’s
surveillance of them, but there can be little doubt that his breach
of the secrecy envelope had serious consequences for U.S., French,
and British intelligence. For example, Francois Molins, the former
head prosecutor of Paris, pointed out that after the Paris attacks the
French investigation had run into an obstacle: end-to-end encryp-
tion. “We can’t penetrate into certain conversations,” he said about
“Telegram,” the end-to-end encryption program that Snowden had
repeatedly recommended, and as a result “we're dealing with this
gigantic black hole, a dark zone where there are just so many dan-
gerous things going on.”

The effects of Snowden’s intervention were soon realized by the
CIA, according to Michael Morell, who had closely followed intel-
ligence about terrorist groups in the Middle East ever since he had
acted as the CIA’s briefer for the president on the day of the 9/11
attack, “Terrorist organizations around the world were already start-
ing to modify their actions in light of what Snowden disclosed,”
Morell wrote in 2015. “Within weeks of the [Snowden] leaks, com-

© munications sources dried up, tactics were changed.” Even more ©
disturbing, suspects on the CIA’s watch list began switching to an
“encryption platform.” Instead of continuing to rely on the Inter-
net to protect their messages, they increased their use of end-to-end
encryption, which defeated the effectiveness of PRISM’s captur-
ing Internet traffic before it was encrypted by Internet companies.
Indeed, after the Snowden breach, ISIS even provided a tutorial on
its websites about using end-to-end encryption. So Morell and oth-
ers at the CIA helplessly watched as this previous source of unex-
pected intelligence went dark.

What further heightened Morell’s concern about this sudden loss
of NSA intelligence from these sources was the discovery by the
CIA in January 2014 of two documents, one 26 pages and the other
19 pages, on a captured ISIS computer in Syria. These documents
discussed the advantages of using bubonic plague germs and other
biological weapons against Western civilian populations. They even
provided a religious justification for using biological warfare against
civilian targets in the West. In addition, evidence uncovered from
the safe house used by the ISIS terrorists involved in the Paris attack

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020110.txt,"the air that a terrorist breathed.” This was the precise line Schwartz would hand out to
reporters in the coming days in a further effort to establish Bannon’s right-wing virtue.

Alexandra Preate, Bannon’s lieutenant, arrived at Joe’s out of breath. Seconds later,
Jason Miller, another PR man in the Bannon fold, arrived. During the transition, Miller
had been slated to be the communications director, but then it had come out that Miller
had had a relationship with another staff member who announced in a tweet she was
pregnant by Miller—as was also, at this point, Miller’s wife. Miller, who had lost his
promised White House job but continued serving as an outside Trump and Bannon voice,
was now, with the recent birth of the child—with the recent birth of both of his children by
different women—facing another wave of difficult press. Still, even he was obsessively
focused on what Bannon’s interview might mean.

By now the table was buzzing with speculation.
How would the president react?

How would Kelly react?

Was this curtains?

For a group of people in touch with Bannon on an almost moment-by-moment basis, it
was remarkable that nobody seemed to understand that, forcibly or otherwise, he would
surely be moving out of the White House. On the contrary, the damaging interview was,
by consensus, converted into a brilliant strategic move. Bannon was not going anywhere
—not least because there was no Trump without Bannon.

It was an excited dinner, a revved-up occasion involving a passionate group of people
all attached to the man who they believed was the most compelling figure in Washington.
They saw him as some sort of irreducible element: Bannon was Bannon was Bannon.

As the evening went on, Matt Boyle got in a furious text-message fight with Jonathan
Swan, a White House reporter who had written a story about Bannon being on the losing
side in the Bannon-McMaster showdown. Soon almost every well-connected reporter in
the city was checking in with somebody at the table. When a text came in, the recipient
would hold up his or her phone if it showed a notable reporter’s name. At one point,
Bannon texted Schwartz some talking points. Could it be that this was just one more day
in the endless Trump drama?

Schwartz, who seemed to regard Trump’s stupidity as a political given, offered a
vigorous analysis of why Trump could not do without Bannon. Then, seeking more proof
of his theory, Schwartz said he was texting Sam Nunberg, generally regarded as the man
who understood Trump’s whims and impulses best, and who had sagely predicted
Bannon’s survival at each doubtful moment in the past months.

“Nunberg always knows,” said Schwartz.

That's also true, your Honor, largely with respect to
the rest of the motions. They are asking for an advisory

opinion from this Court about things that may or may not

happen. Your Honor, I just don't see the need to waste more

time on it.

There is only one issue, the one raised in 28 where we

have presented the possibility that as the party that bears the
burden of proof, we would be allowed during closing arguments,
for example, to comment on the lack of proof, which is a common
closing argument.

If they have control over a party and that party

doesn't come and testify, we may, under the appropriate

circumstances and with the right foundation, ask for a missing

witness instruction, your Honor, but these are all advisory

questions at this point.

MS. McCAWLEY: Your Honor, Sigrid McCawley on behalf
of the plaintiff. Would the Court like to take a break at this
point? I know we've gone for a couple hours. I'm not sure how

you'd like to proceed. We're happy to address --

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019949.txt,"Trump would shortly become a Gorsuch fan. But before settling on Gorsuch, he wondered
why the job wasn’t going to a friend and loyalist. In the Trump view, it was rather a waste
to give the job to someone he didn’t even know.

At various points in the process he had run through almost all his lawyer friends—all
of them unlikely, if not peculiar, choices, and, in almost every case, political nonstarters.
The one unlikely, peculiar, and nonstarter choice that he kept returning to was Rudy
Gtuliani.

Trump owed Giuliani; not that he was so terribly focused on his debts, but this was one
that was certainly unpaid. Not only was Giuliani a longtime New York friend, but when
few Republicans were offering Trump their support, and almost none with a national
reputation, Giuliani was there for him—and in combative, fiery, and relentless fashion.
This was particularly true during the hard days following Billy Bush: when virtually
everybody, including the candidate himself, Bannon, Conway, and his children, believed
the campaign would implode, Giuliani barely allowed himself a break from his nonstop,
passionate, and unapologetic Trump defense.

Giuliani wanted to be the secretary of state, and Trump had in so many words offered
him the job. The resistance to Giuliani from the Trump circle derived from the same
reason Trump was inclined to give him the job—Giuliani had Trump’s ear and wouldn’t
let go. The staff whispered about his health and stability. Even his full-on pussygate
defense now started to seem like a liability. He was offered attorney general, Department
of Homeland Security, and director of national intelligence, but he turned them all down,
continuing to hold out for State. Or, in what staffers took to be the ultimate presumption,
or grand triangulation, the Supreme Court. Since Trump could not put someone openly
pro-choice on the court without both sundering his base and risking defeat of his nominee,
then, of course, he’d have to give Giuliani State.

When this strategy failed—Rex Tillerson got the secretary of state job—that should
have been the end of it, but Trump kept returning to the idea of putting Giuliani on the
court. On February 8, during the confirmation process, Gorsuch took public exception to
Trump’s disparagement of the courts. Trump, in a moment of pique, decided to pull his
nomination and, during conversations with his after-dinner callers, went back to
discussing how he should have given the nod to Rudy. He was the only loyal guy. It was
Bannon and Priebus who kept having to remind him, and to endlessly repeat, that in one of
the campaign’s few masterful pieces of issue-defusing politics, and perfect courtship of the
conservative base, it had let the Federalist Society produce a list of candidates. The
campaign had promised that the nominee would come from that list—and needless to say,
Giuliani wasn’t on it.

Gorsuch was it. And Trump would shortly not remember when he had ever wanted
anyone but Gorsuch.

The ugly part of the equation is the rampant growth of the pub-
lic’s distrust of the institutions of government in America. Accord-
ing to recent polls, 4 out of 5 Americans distrust the government.
Snowden did not create this new age of distrust, but his disclosures
greatly contributed to it, as well as to the worldwide distrust of the
U.S. government. This post-Snowden distrust is especially powerful
in the section of the international media that assisted Snowden in
his release of NSA documents. In defending Snowden, it questions
the truthfulness of any government official or member of Congress
who discloses information contradicting Snowden’s claims or show-
ing that there was some benefit to the multibillion-dollar intelli-
gence system that he compromised. Even Senator Dianne Feinstein,
who herself fought the secrecy of the CIA for years, was not exempt
from such distrust when she asserted in June 2013 that the program
that Snowden had compromised had helped avert a bloody carnage
on the New York subways in September 2009, as mentioned earlier.
© That she was the ranking Democrat on the Senate Select Committee ©
on Intelligence, and briefed on the program at the time of the attack,
did not prevent a distrustful press from attempting to impeach her
credibility and that of the fourteen other members of the Senate
Select Committee and the twenty members of the House Select
Committee on Intelligence who had affirmed her assertion.

In this culture of distrust, any claim that any of the secrets that
Snowden disclosed could have caused any harm is preemptively dis-
missed as government propaganda. Snowden’s word also is taken
over that of government officials because, as The Nation explained,
Snowden speaks “truth to power.” Such a formulation of distrust
allows those who accept it to dismiss all assertions of government
officials representing power who contradict Snowden’s version of
reality. Such is Snowden’s glorified aura that even when his rev-
elations expose purported U.S. government actions in foreign lands,
including the alleged tapping of friendly government officials’ con-
versations, such as Angela Merkel’s, these are implicitly conflated
with the NSA’s domestic surveillance program, around which a

Alison Gopnik

Alison Gopnik is a developmental psychologist at UC Berkeley; her books include The
Philosophical Baby and, most recently, The Gardener and the Carpenter: What the New
Science of Child Development Tells Us About the Relationship Between Parents and
Children.

Everyone’s heard about the new advances in artificial intelligence, and especially
machine learning. You’ve also heard utopian or apocalyptic predictions about what those
advances mean. They have been taken to presage either immortality or the end of the
world, and a lot has been written about both those possibilities. But the most
sophisticated Als are still far from being able to solve problems that human four-year-
olds accomplish with ease. In spite of the impressive name, artificial intelligence largely
consists of techniques to detect statistical patterns in large data sets. There is much more
to human learning.

How can we possibly know so much about the world around us? We learn an
enormous amount even when we are small children; four-year-olds already know about
plants and animals and machines; desires, beliefs, and emotions; even dinosaurs and
spaceships.

Science has extended our knowledge about the world to the unimaginably large
and the infinitesimally small, to the edge of the universe and the beginning of time. And
we use that knowledge to make new classifications and predictions, imagine new
possibilities, and make new things happen in the world. But all that reaches any of us
from the world is a stream of photons hitting our retinas and disturbances of air at our
eardrums. How do we learn so much about the world when the evidence we have is so
limited? And how do we do all this with the few pounds of grey goo that sits behind our
eyes?

The best answer so far is that our brains perform computations on the concrete,
particular, messy data arriving at our senses, and those computations yield accurate
representations of the world. The representations seem to be structured, abstract, and
hierarchical; they include the perception of three-dimensional objects, the grammars that
underlie language, and mental capacities like “theory of mind,” which lets us understand
what other people think. Those representations allow us to make a wide range of new
predictions and imagine many new possibilities in a distinctively creative human way.

This kind of learning isn’t the only kind of intelligence, but it’s a particularly
important one for human beings. And it’s the kind of intelligence that is a specialty of
young children. Although children are dramatically bad at planning and decision making,
they are the best learners in the universe. Much of the process of turning data into
theories happens before we are five.

Since Aristotle and Plato, there have been two basic ways of addressing the
problem of how we know what we know, and they are still the main approaches in
machine learning. Aristotle approached the problem from the bottom up: Start with
senses—the stream of photons and air vibrations (or the pixels or sound samples of a
digital image or recording)—and see if you can extract patterns from them. This
approach was carried further by such classic associationists as philosophers David Hume

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022848.txt,"somewhere between Daddy Warbucks and Eyes Wide Shut.

The domesticity of the house, and the background of Epstein’s problems,
centers around a group of young women who act as his support staff and
companions. Some have worked for him for many years, marrying, having
children, and continuing as part of his business and household infrastructure. One
woman, on an afternoon when I was there, recently married, had just returned from
an around the world honeymoon that Epstein had arranged for her. Some are his
romantic interests. His present girl friend is in dental school. One former girlfriend,
Eva Andersson Dubin, a Swedish model and Miss Universe finalist, became a
doctor and married hedge funder Glen Dubin and together they finance the Dubin
Breast Center at Mount Sinai Hospital. Most at one time will travel with him to his
other floating residences—the ranch in New Mexico, a vast apartment in Paris, the
Island in the Caribbean, the house in Palm Beach.

This is so outside of conventional living or staffing or romantic relationships
that it is hard to describe 1n a straightforward or straight-faced way. It sometimes
seems part of Epstein’s implicit challenge: not just look at me, but can you even
believe what you see? Or it seems he is just oblivious to what others are thinking.
A willful and perhaps fatal tone deafness.

But Hefnerian prurience can also be quite businesslike: poised young
women in a mansion on the Upper East Side with various office responsibilities are
really not that different from any of the art galleries in the surrounding
neighborhood.

Epstein’s young women mingle freely with his powerful guests, not so much
as hostess or, in tabloid language, harem-like (or as “sex slaves”), but often as
attentive students (that, of course, might be regarded as having its own fetish-like
attraction).

Not long ago, Epstein invited me to sit in on a day of presentations to him in
his dining room by various “quants.” Quant theory involves making investments
based solely on mathematical and statistical models. This method can often have
uncanny predictive powers. But the problem is it doesn’t scale very well—the
market, having discerned a pattern of successful investing, quickly copies and
discounts the advantages of the strategy, . Epstein’s effort was to identify, dissect
and choose a dozen or so promising algorithms (each quant is effectively
hawking his secret sauce algorithm) and invest up to $5 million with each. I knew
paltry little about this and so rather found myself identifying with the young
women to whom Epstein was explaining the basic math and mechanics—out of my
league, but grateful for the lesson.

The Epstein house/office is, by careful design, exclusive and club like, part
hang out, part secret society. Along with the difficulty in explaining why, even
after his jail term, the rich and powerful continued to beat a path to his door, it’s

Q. When you were hiring and bringing in all
these new attorneys, did everyone come in as a
partner?

A. No.

Q. How did you decide who came in as a partner
and who came in as an associate?

A. Depended upon their level of expertise,
practice, book of business. It was a decision Stuart
and } made together on a case-by-case basis.

Q. So you and Stu where the -- were in charge
of hiring?

A. Stuart and | tried to consult on every
hiring decision, yes.

Q. Did you guys also decide salaries?

A. 1] generally decided the salary and then let
Stu know what |] was going to do. And he would say if
he thought it was okay or if he thought it was too
much or too little, but ] generally had free reign in
that regard.

Q. Did someone's book of business directly
correlate to the salary that you would offer?

A. That is a very broad question because it
depends upon what other needs we had for that
individual.

Q. What do you mean by what other needs?

SE ER Aca ae

A. Well, I'll give you a good example. My
lawyer, Mr. Nurik, his salary was directly related to
the fact that he was a great lawyer and had a solid
book of business.

Q. Yes.

A. David Boden, on the other hand, was, as J
previously testified, ] don't know if you've had a
chance to read the testimony, but David Boden was not
only the general counsel to the law firm but he was
also -- acted as my consigliere in a significant
number of illegal operations and he was compensated
significantly for that, if that helps you understand
the difference.

Q. It does.

So, for example, when you were hiring former
judges, let's use that as an example, Pedro and Julio,
clearly they don't have a book of business coming in
because they haven't had clients, but they may carry
some sort of prestige or give some legitimacy, if you
will, to the firm. How would you decide the salary
for someone like that?

A. Stuand! would discuss it. It was more a
market issue than anything else, how much are judges
coming off the bench getting, how much business do we
think they can generate.

My recollection is that Dave Rogers's flight
logs were provided by Bruce Rinehart * (ph) who
is a former Assistant U.S. Attorney who had been
inside the Southern District of Florida office at
a time when the Epstein case was the subject of
regular discussion in that office.

And then he had gone to work for some kind of
a law firm or private operation that was located
adjacent to Mr. Epstein's business. And so, now,
Rinehart, who appeared to be being paid by
Mr. Epstein and certainly was adjacent to
Mr. Epstein's business office, was producing
these flight logs. So that, again, aroused
suspicion that the flight logs that were being
produced would have been sanitized or inaccurate.

But even -- I mean, I think the problem with,
you Know, you can't sanitize everything, that
would be too suspicious. And so what was -- what
was evident on these flight logs was, for
example, approximately ten flights by
Mr. Dershowitz with Tatiana has been discussed,

had one female, which again in the context that I
was looking at, seemed to be a potential code

Palm Beach County Court

The criminal case provoked numerous lawsuits from women alleging they were victims of Epstein’s proclivities, followed by secret
settlements with more than two dozen of them. One firm bringing some of those cases employed a young lawyer named Bradley
Edwards, who managed some of the cases. In 2009, a founding partner at the firm, Scott Rothstein, fled the country before
ultimately returning to plead guilty of running a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme built around recruiting investors to buy stakes in litigation

settlements that turned out to be phony.

As details of the fraud emerged, Epstein sued Rothstein and Edwards in Palm Beach County Court for racketeering, alleging, among
other things, that they dangled Bill Clinton’s association with Epstein as a lure to investors, implying that settlements would be fast
and sizable. Epstein ultimately dropped his suit in 2012, but by that time, Edwards had countersued for malicious prosecution and

abuse of process.

That case, along with a claim by Virginia Roberts against the federal government over the 2007 prosecution deal in district court
(which she filed as a “Jane Doe” in 2008), are still pending and are the source of most of the scant information about Clinton that
has appeared. Scarola, who in the past sued Chiquita over payments to violent leftist Colombian rebels and won a $1.45 billion
verdict over Morgan Stanley (that was later overturned), is the lawyer bringing the suit in county court in West Palm Beach, while
Paul Cassell, a former federal judge known for his critical take on mandatory-minimum sentences, mans the federal case four blocks

away.
Neither Cassell nor Edwards responded to requests for comment.

It is primarily from pleadings in those cases that the press has been getting a glimpse inside the lifestyle of Epstein, and, by

extension, Clinton. “Edwards had sound legal basis for believing former President Clinton had relevant and discoverable information,”

General Hoss Cartwright . We need to inventory the tools we have and then define
our actions. Stop supplies to Assad; provide command and control assets (radios) to
rebels; provide intelligence; develop knowledge and planning for securing WMD.
We need to answer the above questions as part of defining our policy. Intel and

safe harbors that have a protective flank in order to provide good logistics and
supply. Syria is far more difficult in this regard than was Libya. We need strategy
and structures to prevent mass atrocities. Will we put boots on the ground.

Steve Hadley (ex Bush): Need to assure ourselves and the Syrians that we are
aligning with the Syrian people. Forget the UN. This will send a critical message to
China and Russia that they don’t have a veto on US policy. Gain legitimacy by
aligning with Turkey and others. Send a strong and clear message to business and
military community in Syria that we are going to see this through and they should
ditch Assad now.

Bill Perry: I support near term intervention, but not boots on the ground. Support
enforcing no fly — no drive zones. Bring Turkey into operations. US must
participate with its unique capabilities (e.g. AWACs) and let others participate with
less unique assets (supplying arms etc.). There is no prospect of UN cooperation.
But a coalition of the willing (UK, Arab League) will give us the legitimancy we
need. Very good prospect of military success. Reasonable prospect of success on
humanitariean side. We should act, but in a fashion that has most of the action on
the backs of the rebles.

Dennis Ross (ex Obama): Costs and consequences of intervention have been
discussed, but most of these consequences and costs will come to fruition whether
we go in or don’t go in, therefore we should go in and impact the outcome. Reach
out to KSA and Alawites. Don’t dither over analysis.

R REPRINT OF THIS STORY 
Just days before a Friday deadline, the Justice Department has reassigned the Jeffrey Epstein victims' rights 
case to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Atlanta, the attorneys representing Epstein's victims' attorneys said 
Tuesday. 
Miami federal prosecutors, in letter to attorneys for the victims's lawyers on Monday, said they had recused 
themselves from the case, according to Brad Edwards and Jack Scarola, representing Epstein's victims. 
The reassignment means that the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, Byung J. BJay Pak, will 
oversee the case for the government. Pak, a former Georgia lawmaker, was appointed Atlanta's chief federal 
prosecutor by President Trump in October 2017. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031392 
The Justice Department is still under a Friday deadline for prosecutors to confer with the victims' attorneys in 
an effort to settle the case. On Feb. 22, U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra in Palm Beach ruled that federal 
prosecutors, under former Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta, broke the law when they concealed a plea 
agreement from more than 30 underage girls in Palm Beach who had been sexually abused by Epstein, a 
multimillionaire New York hedge fund manager. 
Marra stopped short of voiding the agreement, which granted Epstein and an untold number of accomplices 
immunity from federal prosecution for sex trafficking crimes, provided Epstein plead guilty to minor charges 
in state court. At the time of the plea deal, federal prosecutors had gathered enough evidence against Epstein to 
write a 53-page federal indictment, court records show.

An investigation by the Miami Herald, Perversion of Justice, found that after Acosta met privately with one 
of Epstein's lawyers, the government agreed to seal the plea agreement so that no one — not the victims, not 
even the state court judge who sentenced Epstein — would know the full extent of his crimes. Epstein, now 66, 
was allowed to plead guilty to prostitution charges and served 13 months in the Palm Beach County jail, where 
he was given liberal work release, and allowed to travel to New York and his private island in the Caribbean 
during his subsequent house arrest. He was released in 2009, and now divides his time between New York, 
Palm Beach and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
The Herald interviewed four of Epstein's victims, who were as young as 13 at the time they were abused by 
Epstein. They said they felt betrayed by state and federal prosecutors, who treated them like prostitutes instead 
of victims. Two of them sued the federal government in 2008 under the Crime Victims' Rights Act, which 
grants crime victims the right to be informed about plea deals and to confer with prosecutors. 
Marra, in a 33-page opinion, said prosecutors not only intentionally violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act, 
but they misled the girls into believing that the FBI's sex trafficking case against Epstein was ongoing — 
when, in fact, prosecutors had secretly closed it after sealing the plea bargain from the public record. 
Marra, noting that he reviewed affidavits, depositions and interrogatories, said Epstein worked in concert with 
others to obtain minors not only for his own sexual gratification, but also for the sexual gratification of 
others. 
The victims' attorneys — Edwards, Scarola and Paul Cassell — have asked the Justice Department to throw 
out Epstein's plea agreement and reopen the criminal investigation. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031393 
Edwards, who brought the victims' rights case against the government, said transferring the case to another 
jurisdiction is a prudent decision. 
I think it's good that we're going to get fresh eyes and a fresh opinion on the way the case was handled, 
Edwards said Tuesday. We were obviously in an adversarial posture with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami 
because they handled the case to begin with. 
Miami's new U.S. Attorney, Ariana Fajardo Orshan — who was appointed by President Trump in September 
— did not respond to a request for comment.

Edwards predicted that it would take some time for Pak's office to review the case, which includes more than 
500 docket entries and thousands of documents. He said If the sides can't agree on a resolution, then Marra 
would likely have to come up with one. The case is being closely watched by crime victims' rights advocates, 
as it will likely set a precedent. 
Acosta, who was appointed by Trump as the U.S. secretary of labor in 2017, is the focus of a separate Justice 
Department investigation into whether there was any prosecutorial misconduct in the Epstein case. That probe, 
by the DOJ's Office of Professional Responsibility, was initiated in response to demands from a bipartisan 
group in Congress, led by Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman 
Schultz of Florida. 
In the meantime, a court hearing will be held at 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York in another Epstein-related 
case. A federal appeals court will hear oral arguments in a motion by the Miami Herald, supported by 32 other 
news organizations, asking the court to unseal documents that could reveal details about the extent of Epstein's 
crimes and any other people who may have been involved. 
Three of Epstein's former attorneys — who helped negotiate his plea deal in 2008 — wrote a letter published 
in the New York Times on Monday, defending the plea bargain cut with Acosta as a fair deal. The letter was in 
response to a Times editorial that called on Congress and the Trump administration to hold Acosta and others 
involved in the case accountable. 
Epstein's lawyers said the editorial's conclusions were in profound conflict with the reality, noting that there 
was no evidence that Epstein committed federal sex trafficking offenses. The letter was signed by former

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028642.txt,"“Datapalooza.” Here’s the reference:

“New college ratings will help students compare the value offered by different colleges,” the fact sheet said. “The
Department of Education will enlist entrepreneurs and technology leaders with a ‘Datapalooza’ to catalyze new private-
sector tools, services, and apps to help students evaluate and select colleges. The effort will be complemented by earnings
information by college that will be released for the first time on [the] administration’s College Scorecard this fall.”

Whatis a datapalooza? Apparently, itis a festival of, or related to, data. The White House and the Education Department
hosted such an event Oct. 9. Students and parents are arguably awash in data now, much of it conflicting and confusing.
Some would say more is better.

Few would argue that better data would be best of all for the consumer.
The yen for better data is shared not just by Obama but also by some colleges. Start with graduation rates.

Now, the federal government measures how many students graduate within four years or six years of starting college. But it
only measures that for students who are first-timers, who are enrolled full-time and who don’t transfer from one institution to
another, omitting a huge share of the college population. Millions of students are part-timers. Community colleges with
excellent records of getting students into prestigious four-year schools are not rewarded for their efforts if those students fail
to pick up an associate’s degree before they transfer. Nor are four-year colleges that give transfer students or former
dropouts a second chance and help them get a bachelor’s degree.

The Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, which represents schools such as the University of Maryland, is
spearheading an effort to improve this flawed metric, using not only federal data but also information from the nonprofit
National Student Clearinghouse to track degree completion for students who move from one school to another.

One question Education Secretary Arne Duncan will face, as he confers with colleges to create a ratings system within the
next two years, is what kind of graduation rate the government will use. Another is what kind of data the government will
report on income of college graduates.

All we know about the federal rating metrics at this point are rough sketches from the fact sheet, highlighting these potential
factors: “access, such as percentage of students receiving Pell grants; affordability, such as average tuition, scholarships,
and loan debt; and outcomes, such as graduation and transfer rates, graduate earnings, and advanced degrees of college
graduates.”

The plan envisions that ratings will be tied to student aid formulas by 2018, if Congress agrees. That is a big if. It’s also a year
after Obama’s term ends.

There is nothing in the plan that would force states to give more funding to public higher education, one of the key cost
drivers in tuition. The president recognized the issue, touting a proposal that he has made before — a “Race to the Top”
incentive fund of $1 billion for higher education. This fund would aim to spur state reforms and reward states that maintain
strong higher education funding, much as an identically named fund for K-12 education did in 2009 and 2010. Butitis
unlikely to win congressional approval.

Obama’s plan highlights innovation. The president gave a major shout-out to a movement to award degrees based not on
how much time students spend in class but on how well they master their material, citing an experiment under way at
Southern New Hampshire University and one that is about to launch at the University of Wisconsin.

“So the idea would be if you’re learning the material faster, you can finish faster, which means you pay less and you save
money,” Obama said Thursday in a speech at the University at Buffalo. This notion is indeed revolutionary in academia
because most degrees are awarded based on the concept of a credit hour — which is a rough measure of the time a student
spends doing work in and for a course.

Obama also underscored the online learning movement, which has gained steam in recent years, saying that it holds out the

promise of reducing costs. Carnegie Mellon, Arizona State and Georgia Tech universities won coveted presidential
mentions in the speech. So did the University of Maryland, in the fact sheet. Fans of massive open online courses, or

been prepared by the state's attorney's office but he didn't

know. So what happens then with this transcript is, there is

an attempt at a deposition of Ms. Hall in Miami, this summer,

and Ms. Hall comes in and she sits down, and she doesn't want

to answer any questions about anything, and she says, I don't
remember anything about any of this. Her lawyer says, she

doesn't remember anything about any of this and she spent the

last ten years forgetting about all of this and she's not going

to remember anything about this. Mr. Edwards then puts the

transcript in front of her and she doesn't look at it. She

doesn't even look at the transcript. She doesn't turn the

page. She doesn't read any of it. There's a question asked at

some point later: Isn't it true that everything you said in

the police department was true? And then shortly after that,

the deposition ends. And they're trying to say that that is a
sufficient factual basis and an evidentiary basis for the
admission of this transcript, which is, you know, unsponsored
hearsay.

There's a similar problem with this recording because

Ms. Hall never listened to the recording, never authenticated

the recording. And so there's no evidence whatsoever that it's

Ms. Hall's statement or that it was subject to any

cross-examination.

So to try to get around all of these evidentiary

problems, now what's being advanced by the plaintiffs is, well,

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018666.txt,"In short, a neg will buy you the credibility you need to sincerely compliment her later.

That said, I don't necessarily advocate negs; they are in many ways a temporary patch to
stick onto your personality while you learn to possess real confidence and strength of
character.

Although this is a manipulative approach, it is not inevitably harmful. It also is not
limited to the sphere of sexual relationships; humans often pretend not to care what other
people think, and consistently attempt to be taken seriously by others. Additionally, for
many people, flirting involves a certain amount of strategic ambiguity and plausible
deniability, and negs are a useful tactic for that kind of game. Not everyone likes playing
such tacit and confusing games, but many people do.

However, this is all cute and mild compared to how some PUAs talk about negs: some
cite the neg specifically as a tactic to make the girl feel bad.

A well-known PUA who goes by the name of Tyler Durden once wrote that: You use
self-esteem negs to lower the target's self-esteem, and crave your attention to re-validate
herself. Similarly, an especially pitiless PUA blogger who is sometimes described as
the Darth Vader of PUAs writes that:

The best negs are those which are conceivably meant as compliments, but which linger in
her psyche for hours afterward, undermining her self-conception and encouraging her to
qualify herself to you [i.e. encouraging her to explain why she's worth your time].... [A
neg] infiltrates a girl's subconscious so that she spends more mental energy analyzing
her worth than she does analyzing yours.

One commenter adds to the above blogger's words that: So long as you have a woman
auditioning for you, power remains where it belongs -- squarely in your pocket.

In other words, a person who feels anxious and unworthy will be easier to control. These
cruel PUAs have learned the same lesson as thousands of people in abusive relationships.

Here is an especially instructive quotation from the comments on Darth Vader's blog:
[Women] really are insipid, vapid airheads. If it wasn't for the pussy, there would be a
bounty on them.” That statement is interesting not just because of its hatred but because
of its fear. After all, no one puts a bounty on targets that are not dangerous. The most
misogynist corners of the PUA subculture not only discuss ways to aggressively
manipulate women; they also paint women as selfish, deceitful and hazardous.

The various approaches to negging highlight both the different shadings of opinion across
the subculture, and a particularly important distinction among PUAs themselves. Some of
these men genuinely do enter pickup artistry out of a desire to connect to women. As one
PUA told me, When I first looked at PUA stuff, I was like, 'This is so sleazy and gross.’
But I'd never had a girlfriend, and I kept telling myself, Dude, you are lonely and
miserable and you don't want to die alone. On the other hand, many PUAs become
PUAs because they want unilateral power and control over women -- and many PUAs
attempt to justify this through narratives and jokes that encourage fear and anger against
women.

put her. But because they were exchanging private text messages
by then, he would not have needed to consult her public journal.
Snowden was certainly aware that he would soon be the object of a
manhunt that could involve those with whom he was acquainted. He
instructed Poitras to mask their e-mail communications in cyber-
space “so we don’t have a clue or record of your true name in your
file communication chain.” Such precautions were necessary, he
explained to her, because “every trick in the book is likely to be used
in looking into this.” The journalists arrived the evening of June 2.

The Mira hotel can be entered by guests both through a ground-
floor lobby with a restaurant and a smaller third-floor lobby that
connects to the Mira shopping mall. The instructions that Snowden
sent Poitras on her arrival were an exercise in control: “On timing,
regarding meeting up in Hong Kong, the first rendezvous attempt
will be at 10 a.m. local time. We will meet in the hallway outside
of the restaurant in the Mira Hotel. I will be working on a Rubik’s
cube so that you can identify me. Approach me and ask if I know the
hours of the restaurant. I’ll respond by stating that I’m not sure and

© suggest you try the lounge instead. I’ll offer to show you where it is, ©
and at that point we’re good. You simply need to follow naturally.”
According to Greenwald’s account, Snowden changed the plan to the
upper lobby. “We were to go to the third floor,” Greenwald writes.
“We were to wait on a couch near a ‘giant alligator’ ” which Poitras
said was a room decoration. (A hotel executive told me that the hotel
knew of no plastic alligator on the third floor but possibly it had
been temporarily parked there by a hotel guest.) They were then
to give the recognition signal. Although these instructions provided
the atmospherics of “an international spy thriller,” as Greenwald
described them, Snowden hardly needed any spy tradecraft to recog-
nize Greenwald and Poitras because there were many photographs
of them on the Internet.

In any case, they gave the recognition signal, twice, in the des-
ignated place, and a young man walked over to them holding
a Rubik’s Cube. Greenwald noted, “The first thing I saw was the
unsolved Rubik’s Cube, twirling in the man’s left hand.” The man
said, “Hello,” and introduced himself as “Ed Snowden.”

Greenwald was particularly surprised by Snowden’s boyish looks.

learned the power of a claim of abuse, and used the threat of it to control his
environment. Damon talked other children out of their candy allotments, cheated at
games and stole clothes from other children’s lockers.

Debbie, age eight, was the eldest of four children. Her mother was a street
prostitute with an expensive drug habit. Debbie was thin, restless and worried. A
self-appointed mother from the age of four, Debbie felt responsible for the care and
feeding of her brother and two sisters. With a history of physical and sexual abuse
by a series of her mother’s boyfriend-pimps, Debbie spent most of her time cleaning
and recleaning their small apartment and worrying about obtaining enough food for
her brothers and sisters. Her mother was often gone for one or two days at a time,
and food supplies were not dependable. On several occasions, Debbie was caught
stealing food from all night grocers. The investigative social worker reported that
Debbie had learned to sell oral sex to the men who loitered behind a neighborhood
bar. She used the money to buy food. For several days after admission to the crisis
home, Debbie was anxious and sleepless. She worried endlessly about the welfare
of her sisters and brother despite reassurances that they were in caring foster
homes. She checked on them as frequently as allowed by phone. In a playroom
therapy session, wielding a rubber knife, she pointed to a scar on her left forearm
and told a story about the time that she cut herself with a kitchen knife and fed her
blood to her infant sister when there wasn’t any food in the house. Debbie kept her
room very tidy, did all her chores and sometimes those of other children. Even after
several months in residence, always-busy Debbie didn’t have even one close
relationship with any of the other children or members of the staff.

Despite the superficial differences, there are subtle and pervasive similarities
among the personality styles of Alicia, Grace, Damon and Debbie. Like overgrown
and tasteless cabbages, pale and four feet across, growing from seeds over-treated
with gibberellin or auxin plant hormones, the inner lives of these prematurely big
little people are relatively empty of stable interpersonal objects. The pantheon of
indwelling companions are either malignant, absent or both. There is a deficiency of

internalized significant others with qualities we more healthy neurotics paste onto

Professors and universities are very concerned about the evaluations
of the teaching of the faculty and these days websites (like www.rate-
myprofessors.com) make a very public show of how badly received
some professors are. The professors are concerned with how they ap-
pear and whether they are liked and how all this might affect their
salaries. They are not concerned with teaching effectiveness because
they are not really teachers in their own minds.

Let’s hear from an Ivy League professor (who also doesn’t want to
be named):

There are faculty here who study real-world phenomena and
don’t know how to apply that knowledge to their own lives. We
could teach students here how to make use of what we teach

in their own lives, we just don’t. Right now the approach that
is taken makes most of the information that professors impart
useless. It doesn’t have to be that way.

My colleagues here don’t even do what they are studying
when they are out of the lab. They are not successful people in
life. If someone studying memory had to remember something,
would they make use of their own data? I doubt it. Many of our
professors don’t realize that they may not know as much as they
think they know. All these people assume that whatever they do
is the best that can be done.

When a child learns to walk, you cannot say you were very good at
teaching her to walk. She would have learned to walk without your
help, most likely. When you teach a child to play baseball, you can
more easily say that you were a good teacher, but really who knows
you didn’t screw him up with nonsense that it may take him years to
undo? I was taught to step into the pitch in baseball and years later
learned that what I was taught was wrong.

College professors can be evaluated on effectiveness only if some-
one knows what that means. Does it mean how well students do on
exams? We can make easier exams then. Does it mean how many of
them get into Ph.D. programs at Harvard or how many get good jobs
upon graduation? That likely has nothing to do with the effectiveness
of the professors.

There are no measures that make sense, for a very simple reason.
College teaching doesn’t make much sense in the first place. Lecturing

that outcome. But avoiding the worst case requires a short-term bargain plus a
long-term compromise on a scale not seen in Washington since the Clinton-
Congressional budget showdown of 1995/96. As with sausage making, this
process won’t be pleasant to watch. It would be easier to return in several
weeks when the final product is ready, but for those who cannot avoid, ignore
the likely volatility, and add to defensive trades.

Washington needs at least a month to broker deferral of a decent part of the
fiscal cliff before it can assume the monumental task of comprehensive fiscal
reform next year, and the currencies most vulnerable to an impasse are
expensive. If no grand bargain is reached before the end of the year, full
implementation of the cliff implies enough fiscal tightening to drive the dollar
up 3%-5% versus commodity currencies, given typical patterns during global
growth shocks. Even if these tax increases are reversed later in the year, the
first response would be a higher USD versus all currencies but the yen, given
how long that investors are of cyclical currencies and how short they are the
yen.

Stay short USD/JPY and buy USD vs high-beta (AUD, NZD, SEK and GBP)
in cash and options for a move of a few percent in coming weeks. In options,
sell a 1-mo NZD/USD call (0.8250 strike, 0.83 RKI), buy a bearish 2-mo
AUD/USD seagull (buy 1.03-1.01 put spread, sell 1.05 call) and buy a bearish
2-mo GBP/USD seagull (buy 1.57-1.55 put spread, sell 1.6250 call). Buy
USD/SEK in cash.

Commodities

Commodities are up some 1% this week, led by precious metals, which
rallied almost 4%. The strong gains in gold are probably due to the US
election result as Obama’s victory means no change to Fed policy and so
continued QE and negative real yields. Gold also tends to gain when there is
high fiscal uncertainty, just as it did last year during the acrimonious debt
ceiling debate which cost the US its AAA rating. We stay long gold.

Chinese economic data came out stronger than expected this week, providing
support for our view that Chinese economic growth has bottomed and will
rebound through next year. China’s slowing activity growth has been a major
drag on commodities over the last few years and the improving economy is
what makes us long base metals.

The expected rebound in Chinese growth does not imply that we will go back
to the double-digit growth rates that we saw before the crisis, and immediately
after. The periods when China’s economy grew at a pace above 8% coincided
with very strong price gains on commodities, as tt boosted global demand.
China’s leadership is in the process of reorienting its economy towards
domestic consumption and to reduce reliance on exports and capital
investments. As a result, Chinese growth will likely settle in a 7%-8% range
over the medium term, a growth pace that in the past has not put upwards
pressure on commodity prices.

Chinese Race.”* Hong Kong has long been a base for flag-waving Chinese activists
agitating on the issue of the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. “The Chinese race does not
fight wars. The Chinese race only safeguards peace!” runs one pronouncement which
was designed as an outreach to potential supporters on Okinawa. “The Chinese race
is relying on you. The Chinese race today relies on you, and the Chinese race can
rely on you.”° Even more extreme is the way that the group frames its assertion that
the Ryukus (Senkaku/Diaoyu) should become part of China. “The Japanese people
are a part of the Chinese race and Japan is originally of Chinese blood,” the group’s
president, Zhao Dong, says in one posting.

For the CCP in Beijing, with an eye on the long game, building links between
malcontents in Okinawa and patriots in Hong Kong could easily pay off in the future.

Countering Chinese Influence

The Japanese government has been at the forefront of attempts to counter Chinese
efforts for influence throughout Asia. It maintains a robust, if under-the-radar,
relationship with Taiwan. It has strong ties to Vietnam and it has attempted to
modify China’s influence over Cambodia and Laos, although to little effect. Japan
has a close relationship with New Delhi that involves not simply trade but also
security. Japan and India recently unveiled the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor as a
way to compete with Chinese influence in Africa. Japan’s ties to Australia are deep
as well.’ Japan’s government was the source of the expression “Free and open Indo-
Pacific” as a counterpoint to China’s attempts to turn the Western Pacific (or at least
the South China Sea) into a Chinese lake. Moreover, Japanese firms currently are
outpacing Chinese firms in terms of infrastructure investment in Southeast Asia.

$150.00 and a fine of $250.00 a day to start on June 19, 2008 if compliance is not
achieved by June 18, 2008.

Mr. Ballentine asked for clarification on the motion and was advised by Mr.
Randolph that it would be a finding of non-compliance of Chapter 10, Section 10-
6, administrative costs of $150.00 and a compliance date of July 18, 2008 with a
fine to be considered at the next meeting if compliance was not achieved.

Ms. Duemler said she believed that the dog, besides being a nuisance, is a threat to
society and she hoped that by Tuesday the dog did not break loose from Dr. Lynn
and maul some child, that she believed it is a disgrace and she supports the Town.

MOTION BY MR. FRIED TO FIND DR. LYNN IN VIOLATION OF
CHAPTER 10, SECTION 10-6, ASSESS ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN
THE AMOUNT OF $150.00 AND REQUIRE HIM TO COME INTO
COMPLIANCE BY JULY 18, 2008

MOTION SECONDED BY MR. BALLENTINE

MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY

Mr. Randolph asked if a motion could be made to defer the consideration of
violation of Chapter 10, Section 10-45 (i) until the August 21, 2008 meeting and
Ms. Greenberg advised she would make that motion. Mr. Fried asked Mr.
Randolph if he would explain the reason for this. Mr. Randolph said the argument
had been made that 10-45 should not apply because the dog has already been
deemed dangerous by the County and pursuant to the Town’s Code. Mr.
Randolph said he believed the argument was going to be made in court on Tuesday
that it is not appropriate for the Town to move forward with regard to 10-45 (1)
because that only applies to any incident that occurs after the dog has been
declared dangerous. The argument has been made that Dr. Lynn has done
everything he is required to do. Mr. Randolph said he hesitated to explain further
if the matter was going to be deferred. Mr. Randolph said the position of Staff is
that item (i) stands on its own merits, that it is not connected to 10-45 (a) through
(h). It is also the position of Staff that it is appropriate to bring a violation of (i) to
the Code Enforcement Board even though it does not specifically state that in 10-
45 because Section 2-439, which is the citation fine schedule, sets forth all of the
sections of the Code of Ordinances which can be brought before the Code
Enforcement Board and 10-45 is listed. Code Enforcement has the right to bring a
violation directly to the Code Enforcement Board instead of issuing the fine set
forth in the fine schedule. Mr. Randolph said the Board could move forward in
considering 10-45 instead of deferring it to the next meeting.

Mr. Fried commented that based on the egregious nature of what they had been

presented with, he believed the Board should do everything they could to put
pressure on Dr. Lynn to comply. Mr. Randolph questioned whether the Town

simply to withdraw the paper. Clinton’s answer encouraged, and surprised, me.
“We agree,” he said. “The paper no longer exists.” It soon turned out the
Palestinians were unhappy with it too, but for another reason. On the lookout for
validation of Arafat’s insistence that Camp David was an Israeli “trap”, they were
convinced that the paper had Israel’s fingerprints all over it. That wasn’t true. The
one change we’d insisted on was because it misrepresented our position on
Jerusalem. Still, since Dennis had added the word “expanded” to the Jerusalem
section in longhand, the Palestinians were convinced of Israel co-authorship.

In fact, three days into the summit, the mood among the Palestinians seemed
increasingly aggrieved. Not just the Americans, but some members of my own
team, were urging me to show more “personal warmth” towards Arafat. I did
always exchange greetings and pleasantries with him at mealtimes in Laurel
Lodge, but even there, I admit, that I didn’t exactly show enthusiasm, much less
ebullience. After one dinner, when I’d been placed between the Palestinian leader
and Chelsea Clinton, the President’s National Security Adviser, Sandy Berger,
asked me why, rather than talking to Arafat, I’d spent almost the entire time
chatting with Chelsea. My response was only half-joking: “Given the choice, who
wouldn’t?”

It wasn’t only that I believed a charm initiative would come over as contrived. I
didn’t want to risk misleading Arafat, the other Palestinians and possibly the
Americans as well, by giving them the impression I was satisfied with the progress
of the summit, or felt that we were heading towards any serious engagement and
compromise on the core issues. I had met Arafat many times before Camp David. I
had made it clear in all of those meeting that, despite differences on a range of
difficult issues, I did want a final peace agreement and that I was ready to consider
the tough decisions necessary to make it possible. At Camp David, I was not
against meeting Arafat as a matter of principle. I simply felt the time for such a
meeting, if it came, would be at the moment that we saw at least some signal of a
readiness on his part to negotiate seriously.

Still, given the strength of feeling among some of my own negotiators, I felt a
responsibility to give it a try. I told Yossi Ginossar, the former Shin Bet officer
who was closest to the Palestinian leader among the Israelis, to set up an informal
meeting. I added, to Yossi’s obvious satisfaction and surprise, that I'd be willing to
have the meeting in Arafat’s cabin if that’s what he preferred. The next afternoon, I
went there for tea and baklava. Abu Mazen, his top political adviser and the main

MOSES (Meta-Optimizing Semantic Evolutionary Search): An algorithm for proce-
dure learning, which in the current implementation learns programs in the Combo language.
MOSES is an evolutionary learning system, which differs from typical genetic programming
systems in multiple aspects including: a subtler framework for managing multiple demes”
or “islands” of candidate programs; a library called Reduct for placing programs in Elegant
Normal Form; and the use of probabilistic modeling in place of, or in addition to, mutation
and crossover as means of determining which new candidate programs to try.

Motoric: Pertaining to the control of physical actuators, e.g. those connected to a robot.
May sometimes be used to refer to the control of movements of a virtual character as well.
Moving Bubble of Attention: The Attentional Focus of a CogPrime system.

Natural Language Comprehension: See Language Comprehension

Natural Language Generation: See Language Generation

Natural Language Processing (NLP): See Language Processing

NLGen: Software for carrying out the surface realization phase of natural language gen-
eration, via translating collections of RelEx output relationships into English sentences.
Was made functional for simple sentences and some complex sentences; not currently under
active development, as work has shifted to the related Atom2Link approach to language
generation.

Node: A type of Atom. Links and Nodes are the two basic kinds of Atoms. Nodes, math-
ematically, can be thought of as O-ary links. Some types of Nodes refer to external or
mathematical entities (e.g. WordNode, NumberNode); others are purely abstract, e.g. a
ConceptNode is characterized purely by the Links relating it to other atoms. Grounded-
PredicateNodes and GroundedSchemaNodes connect to explicitly represented procedures
(sometimes in the Combo language); ungrounded PredicateNodes and SchemaNodes are
abstract and, like ConceptNodes, purely characterized by their relationships.

Node Probability: Many PLN inference rules rely on probabilities associated with Nodes.
Node probabilities are often easiest to interpret in a specific context, e.g. the probability
P(cat) makes obvious sense in the context of a typical American house, or in the context
of the center of the sun. Without any contextual specification, P(A) is taken to mean
the probability that a randomly chosen occasion of the system’s experience includes some
instance of A.

Novamente Cognition Engine (NCE): A proprietary proto-AGI software system, the
predecessor to OpenCog. Many parts of the NCE were open-sourced to form portions of
OpenCog, but some NCE code was not included in OpenCog; and now OpenCog includes
multiple aspects and plenty of code that was not in NCE.

OpenCog: A software framework intended for development of AGI systems, and also for
narrow-AI application using tools that have AGI applications. Co-designed with the Cog-
Prime cognitive architecture, but not exclusively bound to it.

OpenCog Prime (OCP): The implementation of the CogPrime cognitive architecture
within the OpenCog software framework.

OpenPsi: CogPrime’s architecture for motivation-driven action selection, which is based
on adapting Dorner’s Psi model for use in the OpenCog framework.

Operational Agent Controller (OAC): In some OpenCog configurations, this is a soft-
ware server containing a CogServer devoted to real-time control of an agent (e.g. a virtual
world agent, or a robot). Background, offline learning tasks may then be dispatched to other
software processes, e.g. to a Learning Server.

Some thoughts I meant to send back for a long time:

no worry, if i understand correctly you are suggsting there are layers 1 through N. lets cal them L 1 - 
Ln. there are times T 1- Tn / and then conjecture that changing the time . correlations ( by genetic swtch 
or other method. , you might be able to make blacks smarter by changing the time for motor layer 
development and changing the time for other layers. . ). like telemeres for the cell , are their equivalents 
for the layers. . as you talked about culling the unused neurons in each layer, each neuron in each layer 
would get dfferent ( kill yourself if you are not being used instructions ). 
Exactly. I looked up the statistics, black kids in the US have slower cognitive development (and never catch 
up), which the study of course attributed to social factors without any evidence, and they had faster motor 
development! I suspect this means their brains are slower at learning high-level concepts, because the low-
level structures are optimized for a shorter time. But they will keep the lead in motor development, because it 
is easier to learn, and they have more time and attention to practice once they get the structures in place. 
It could also be that they have an additional set of learning directives in place that adapts them better to a 
more hunting/running style of life, whereas the Europeans had to adapt for identifying long-term seasonal 
patterns, delayed gratification for agriculture etc. 
and CONCEPTS could be layer to layer communicaiton. . are gender differences also a matter of time, 
and structure of interactions. . 
I suspect gender differences are mostly motivational, i.e. we have a reward system for all the different social 
and cognitive needs, which makes us receive different kinds of pleasure and pain, thereby pay attention and 
learn. You cannot learn what does not attract your attention. Women tend to find abstract systems, conflicts 
and mechanisms intrinsically boring. Most women in computer science do not write programs because they 
enjoy solving puzzles, but because they want to help people, get approval etc. There are almost no women in 
math, because it does not help people or yield social attention. 
Men tend to find elaborate social relations boring. If there is no pleasure in observing and empathizing with 
people, one will not have good social cognition. 
IQ is not the only meaningful difference. Chinese pay an inordinate amount of attention to authority. I 
suspect historically., the authorities tended to kill them a lot if they did not. Jews tend be intellectually 
independent and anti-authoritarian, which might make them creative and inventive in ways that are hard to 
find in Asia. 
At the moment, I think speed/quality of brain development plus motivational system are the key to 
understanding both mind and individual differences. Important part of human language might be the result in 
a motivational need to discover/invent grammatical structure, which as a side effect makes us interested in 
music. 
It would mean that Chomsky's life long hypothesis, that people have a special circuit for grammatical 
language, is wrong. They might be GENERAL learners, just like Gorillas, but with a strong motivational 
urge to build grammatical structure, which the brain simply invents (there are only a few ways in which a 
natural language can work). That is much easier to wire into a brain than a specific circuit. 
i my self believe that african music, westrn music , chinese music are a window into the the structure of 
those layers. . western rigid, african primitve , chinese nature based, . I belive that synphoic movments 
best describe your layering, they open with a basic simple melody„ after it is learned, it is repeated and

 developed , inverted, distorted, related, etc. the development stage take a long time. then there is a 
recapitlaltion of the whole. and its inter and intra actions. . african musci has lots of beats. and little 
development. - no accident, it mirrors their learning process. 
Interesting question if music is somehow indicative of genetically defined prefs, but I am not sure. It could 
be path effects, starting in culture.

, maybe climate change is a good way of dealing with overpopulation. 
fire. potentailly a good thing for the species 
. the earths forest 
Making having children expensive in terms of upbringing and missed opportunity (like in the west) is a more 
humane way. Environmental stress while leaving near rock bottom tends to lead people to have more 
children, because there is no missed opportunity, and high mortality requires more attempts at procreation. 
Humans are a hardy species, outside of focused famine events and wars only small fractions of any given 
population die. 
I suspect that strong reductions in population will come from large-scale failure of agriculture. The climate 
change itself with result in migration and wars, but most people will probably survive that. But who knows, I 
might be wrong. 
too many people, so many mass executions of the elderly and infirm make sense 
is the fundamental fact that everyone dies at some time .make it imporrisbole to ask so why 
not earilier. if the brain discards unused neurons, why shold socieity keep their equivalent 
The radical idea of treating individuals in a society as cells and the society itself as a well-organized 
organism is fascism, or course. Probably the most efficient and rationally stringent way of governance, if 
someone could pull it off in a sustainable way; and if it is aggressive and expansive, its efficiency makes it a 
virus that everybody will want to stomp out. Fascism makes romantic doo-gooders like me very 
uncomfortable (I visited KZ Buchenwald five times and it had a profound influence on me; we East Germans 
inoculated ourselves very thoroughly against fascism), and the general public will not be willing to consider 
it. 
I rather like the treatment Fascism gets in the Amazon Series The Man in the High Castle, which explores 
what would have happened if the Germans and Japanese had won the war: A society that tries to function as 
a brutal and ruthlessly efficient machine, eliminating all social and evolutionary slack. It is very dark, but not 
a flat caricature of pointless evil for its own sake. Heinlein's late book Starship Troopers explores fascism, 
too, but unlike Philipp K Dick he does not see it as a form of insanity, but as the most desirable order. 
I find your political incorrectness very fascinating. In the beginning, I thought it is a form of costly 
signaling, but now I think you are simply entirely unconstrained in your thoughts. How did you manage in 
your youth? Did you get in trouble, or did you keep your thoughts to yourself? I wonder what kind of person 
you want to transform into. 
It was interesting to notice that at the Forbidden Research conference, nobody managed to say anything 
remotely out-of line. One large discussion group wanted to address the question of whether democracy still 
works, and mostly expressed their disagreement with Trump. Ideology is like halitosis: easy to see in others, 
hard in oneself A speaker felt that the media stifle all criticism of Trump, another wanted to remove men 
and Elon Musk from government, and everybody strongly agreed that we need more diversity everywhere.

laden topics, but sanitizes them by carefully replacing the parts of content that would divide his audience

The non-controversial parts will still be insightful. He manages to come across as very subversive, while

He also asks influential people and smart students or faculty to write parts of his essays and speeches for 
him. This invests them in his success, especially because he is going to reward and acknowledge them. Very 
few of his ideas are original, instead he is good at identifying and testing thoughts he reads or hears from 
others. 
I am still beset by the ruinous instinct that the goal of communication ought to be mutual understanding. Joi 
is right. Public communication is about reaching one's goals.

Dear Jeffrey, 
thank you for your support and encouragement, even where I fail. 
Sorry for being such an embarrassment today. I will spell out today's argument a bit better and cohesive 
when I get to it. Also, I should have recognized that the main point I tried to make would trigger Noam 
(who was as always very generous, patient, kind and humble on the personal level, even though he did not 
feel like conceding anything on the conceptual one). Almost all of Noam's work focused on the idea that 
humans have very specific circuits or modules (even when most people in his field began to have other 
ideas), and his frustration is that it is so hard to find or explain them. 
I found Noam's hypothesis very compelling in the past. I still think that the idea that language is somehow a 
cultural or social invention of our species is wrong. But I think that there is a chance (we don't know that, 
but it seems to most promising hypothesis IMHO) that the difference between humans and apes is not a 
very intricate special circuit, but genetically simple developmental switches. The bootstrapping of cognition 
works layer by layer during the first 20 years of our life. Each layer takes between a few months and a few 
years to train in humans. While a layer is learned, there is not much going on in the higher layers yet, and 
after the low level learning is finished, it does not change very much. This leads to the characteristic bursts 
in child development, that have famously been described by Piaget. 
The first few layers are simple perceptual stuff, the last ones learn social structure and self-in-society. The 
switching works with something like a genetic clock, very slowly in humans, but much more quickly in 
other apes, and very fast in small mammals. As a result, human children take nine months before their 
brains are mature enough to crawl, and more than a year before they can walk. Many African populations 
are quite a bit faster. In the US, black children outperform white children in motor development, even in 
very poor and socially disadvantaged households, but they lag behind (and never catch up) in cognitive 
development even after controlling for family income. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026416 
Gorillas can crawl after 2 months, and build their own nests after 2.5 years. They leave their mothers at 3-4 
years. Human children are pretty much useless during the first 10-12 years, but during each phase, their 
brains have the opportunity to encounter many times as much training data as a gorilla brain. Humans are 
literally smarter on every level, and because the abilities of the higher levels depend on those of the lower 
levels, they can perform abstractions that mature gorillas will never learn, no matter how much we try to 
train them. 
The second set of mechanisms is in the motivational system. Motivation tells the brain what to pay attention 
to, by giving reward and punishment. If a brain does not get much reward for solving puzzles, the individual 
will find mathematics very boring and won't learn much of it. If a brain gets lots of rewards for discovering 
other people's intentions, it will learn a lot of social cognition. 
Language might be the result of three things that are different in humans: 
- extended training periods per layer (after the respective layer is done, it is difficult to learn a new set of 
phonemes or the first language) 
- more layers 
- different internal rewards. Perhaps the reward for learning grammatical structure is the same that makes us 
like music. Our brains may enjoy learning compositional regular structure, and they enjoy making 
themselves understood, and everything else is something the universal cortical learning figures out on its 
own. 
This is a hypothesis that is shared by a growing number of people these days. In humans, it is reflected for 
instance by the fact that races with faster motor development have lower IQ. (In individuals of the same 
group, slower development often indicates defects, of course.) 
Another support comes from machine learning: we find that the same learning functions can learn visual 
and auditory pattern recognition, and even end-to-end-learning. Google has built automatic image 
recognition into their current photo app: 
http://blogs.wsj . com/digits/2015/07/01/go o gle-mistakenly-tags-black-p eop le-as-gorillas-showing-limits-o f-
algorithms/  
The state of the art in research can do better than that: it can begin to imagine things. I.e. when the 
experimenter asks the system to dream what a certain object looks like, the system can produce a 
somewhat compelling image, which indicates that it is indeed learning visual structure. This stuff is 
something nobody could do a few months ago: 
http://www.creativeai.net/posts/Mv4WG6rdzAerZF7ch/synthesizing-preferred-inputs-via-deep-generator-
networks  
A machine learning program that can learn how to play an Atari game without any human supervision or 
hand-crafted engineering (the feat that gave DeepMind 500M from Google) now just takes about 130 lines 
of Python code. 
These models do not have interesting motivational systems, and a relatively simple architecture. They 
currently seem to mimic some of the stuff that goes on in the first few layers of the cortex. They learn object 
features, visual styles, lighting and rotation in 3d, and simple action policies. Almost everything else is 
missing. But there is a lot of enthusiasm that the field might be on the right track, and that we can learn 
motor simulations and intuitive physics soon. (The majority of the people in Al do not work on this, 
however. They try to improve the performance for the current benchmarks.) 
Noam's criticism of machine translation mostly applies to the Latent Semantic Analysis models that Google 
and others have been using for many years. These models map linguistic symbols to concepts, and relate 
concepts to each other, but they do not relate the concepts to proper mental representations of what 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026417 
objects and processes look like and how they interact. Concepts are probably one of the top layers of the 
learning hierarchy, i.e. they are acquired *after* we learn to simulate a mental world, not before. Classical 
linguists ignored the simulation of a mental world entirely. 
It seems miraculous that purely conceptual machine translation works at all, but that is because concepts are 
shared between speakers, so the structure of the conceptual space can be inferred from the statistics of 
language use. But the statistics of language use have too little information to infer what objects look like 
and how they interact. 
My own original ideas concern a few parts of the emerging understanding of what the brain does. The 
request-confirmation networks that I have introduced at a NIPS workshop in last the December are an 
attempt at modeling how the higher layers might self-organize into cognitive programs. 
Cheers!

explicit. I told President Clinton I could speak only for how I would respond if a
state was indeed declared without a peace deal. “We will extend Israeli sovereignty
over the major settlement blocs. We will establish a security zone in the Jordan
valley, and let them know that there will be a heavy price should they attack any of
the outlying settlements.” In other words, Palestinian unilateral action would
prompt unilateral Israeli action. “And the confrontation will begin.”

Clinton seemed, if not completely revived, considerably more upbeat when he
came back to see me an hour later. He told me that he had received the
Palestinians’ answer. The way he described it to me, Arafat had agreed to leave
President Clinton to decide the amount of West Bank land that would go to a
Palestinian state, a figure he now told me that he was assuming would end up at
around 90 to 92 percent. The trade-off, he said, would be a limited, “symbolic”
land swap. Arafat also wanted control of the Jordan Valley, but had agreed to
begin negotiating on Israeli security needs there as soon as possible. Then, came
Arafat’s counter-conditions, which appeared to bother the President much less than
they did me. Everything would be contingent on an unspecified, “acceptable
outcome on Jerusalem.” And despite Clinton’s emphasis that any meaningful
agreement had to include a formal declaration that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
was “over,” Arafat was insisting that could come only after the terms of whatever
we agreed were fully implemented.

Still, it was at least a step forward. Clinton seemed genuinely encouraged, and I
didn’t want to risk closing off this first chink of light. I suggested, for instance, that
we could address Arafat’s reluctance about an “end of conflict” statement by
providing an American guarantee that the terms of the deal would be implemented.

Still, it very soon became clear that any hope of real progress rested on by far
the most difficult issue: Jerusalem. Across party boundaries, even across divisions
between religious and secular, nearly all Israelis viewed the city as not just our
capital, but the centrepiece of the state. It had been divided after 1948. The Old
City, and the site of the ancient Jewish temple, had been under Jordanian rule for
19 years when our forces recaptured it in the Six-Day War. It was under a Labor

Embodied Communication Prior: The class of prior distributions over (goal, environ-
ment pairs), that are imposed by placing an intelligent system in an environment where
most of its tasks involve controlling a spatially localized body in a complex world, and in-
teracting with other intelligent spatially localized bodies. It is hypothesized that many key
aspects of human-like intelligence (e.g. the use of different subsystems for different memory
types, and cognitive synergy between the dynamics associated with these subsystems) are
consequences of this prior assumption. This is related to the Mind-World Correspondence
Principle.

Embodiment: Colloquially, in an OpenCog context, this usually means the use of an AI
software system to control a spatially localized body in a complex (usually 3D) world. There
are also possible borderline cases” of embodiment, such as a search agent on the Internet.
In a sense any AI is embodied, because it occupies some physical system (e.g. computer
hardware) and has some way of interfacing with the outside world.

Emergence: A property or pattern in a system is emergent if it arises via the combination
of other system components or aspects, in such a way that its details would be very difficult
(not necessarily impossible in principle) to predict from these other system components or
aspects.

Emotion: Emotions are system-wide responses to the system’s current and predicted state.
Dorner’s Psi theory of emotion contains explanations of many human emotions in terms
of underlying dynamics and motivations, and most of these explanations make sense in a
CogPrime context, due to CogPrime’s use of OpenPsi (modeled on Psi) for motivation and
action selection.

Episodic Knowledge: Knowledge about episodes in an agent’s life-history, or the life-
history of other agents. CogPrime includes a special dimensional embedding space only for
episodic knowledge, easing organization and recall.

Evolutionary Learning: Learning that proceeds via the rough process of iterated differen-
tial reproduction based on fitness, incorporating variations of reproduced entities. MOSES
is an explicitly evolutionary-learning-based portion of CogPrime; but CogPrime’s dynamics
as a whole may also be conceived as evolutionary.

Exemplar: (in the context of imitation learning) - When the owner wants to teach an
OpenCog controlled agent a behavior by imitation, he/she gives the pet an exemplar. To
teach a virtual pet fetch for instance, the owner is going to throw a stick, run to it, grab
it with his/her mouth and come back to its initial position.

Exemplar: (in the context of MOSES) — Candidate chosen as the core of a new deme, or
as the central program within a deme, to be varied by representation building for ongoing
exploration of program space.

Explicit Knowledge Representation: Knowledge representation in which individual,
easily humanly identifiable pieces of knowledge correspond to individual elements in a knowl-
edge store (elements that are explicitly there in the software and accessible via very rapid,
deterministic operations)

Extension: In PLN, the extension of a node refers to the instances of the category that
the node represents. In contrast is the intension.

Fishgram (Frequent and Interesting Sub-hypergraph Mining): A pattern mining
algorithm for identifying frequent and/or interesting sub-hypergraphs in the Atomspace.
First-Order Inference (FOI): The subset of PLN that handles Logical Links not in-
volving VariableAtoms or higher-order functions. The other aspect of PLN, Higher-Order
Inference, uses Truth Value formulas derived from First-Order Inference.

Subject: Smart analysis on big tech -- Apple section highlighted 
Importance: High 
China's big tech stocks have fallen into a bear 
market at the same time that regulatory threats 
against U.S. big tech companies are gaining 
momentum. Can U.S. big tech stocks soldier on 
alone or is this a harbinger that the group as a whole 
is losing its tremendous leadership position?

In recent months, China's BAT collapse has demonstrated how costly the expectation of 
invincibility can be—Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent are all down more than 24% 
from their year-to-date closing highs. Citigroup's head of Asia strategy, Mohammed 
Apabhai, told CNN an apt analogy about the investor sentiment that led to BAT's collapse, 
likening the exuberance for tech stocks to the Looney Tunes cartoons in which Wile E. 
Coyote chases Road Runner over a cliff. Given they've more or less moved in 
tandem for years, will FAANG follow the same path as BAT? 
Source: Stockcharts.com 
The BAT collapse was triggered by subpar earnings and a shifting regulatory environment 
in China. Facebook's miss in 2Q18—which drove a $120 billion single-day market cap 
loss, the biggest ever for a U.S. company—showed how decisive a turn could be if more 
U.S. tech darlings stumble this quarter. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 032806 
There are mounting fundamental reasons to question the 3Q18 earnings 
prospects of FAANG, from the accelerating user backlash against Facebook to Apple's 
trade war exposure to Amazon's rapidly-intensifying workforce revolt that could see the e-
commerce giant left with no option but to raise wages and improve workplace conditions 
for its warehouse and Whole Foods employees. 
However, as Apabhai suggests, the message BAT is sending is less about earnings, and 
more about the cost of exuberance. And FAANG exuberance faces threats that go beyond 
fundamentals. A flurry of regulatory announcements last week signaled the 
political tide has turned in the U.S. Across every branch of government, the 
message was consistent: the U.S. no longer trusts tech giants to self-
police. And the public agrees—according to a Gallup poll last month, 79% of 
Americans now believe tech companies should be regulated the same way 
the news media is. 
Regardless of political will, threats may not turn to action in the near term. Nonetheless, 
FAANG appears increasingly vulnerable to a decisive sentiment shift. At some point, the 
relentless barrage of bad news will force investors to begin pricing in regulatory risks. Any 
sustained stumble by FAANG's leadership could cripple exuberance, and cause an 
unraveling of passive and algorithmic strategies that are heavily overweight tech 
(see W/LTWApril 7, 2018 for more). We will continue to watch closely to estimate 
timing, but given SAT's collapse, today more than ever, acute scrutiny of tech 
giant leadership is required. 
Through August 28, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft had accounted for greater than 35% of 
the S&P 500's total return this year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices data. It took 
Amazon just 165 trading days to grow its market value from $600 billion in January to $1 
trillion. The combined market cap of FAAMG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and 
Google) now sits over $4 trillion, or roughly equal to the combined market cap of the 283 
smallest S&P 500 members. 
Tech's continued market leadership means investors have largely discounted 
the mounting risks tech giants face. We have been warning about the downsides of 
tech giant monopolism for more than two years in these pages, from surveillance/data 
security concerns to anticompetitive behavior and their role in escalating inequality. For 
the political establishment, for the media, for the public, this year has seen a 
broad awakening—the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the backlash against Jeff Bezos' 
astonishing wealth, and tech's ever-skyrocketing market caps were all warning signs. The 
past month signals a new phase has begun: from a distant rumbling of change 
to preparation for action. 
The number of significant tech-related regulatory developments that have emerged from 
the U.S. and the E.U. in recent weeks is nothing short of staggering. Here is an 
abbreviated list: 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 032807 
• President Trump attacked Google for liberal bias, and claimed Google, Facebook, 
and Amazon represent a very antitrust situation. 
• Attorney General Jeff Sessions convened a meeting of Republican state 
attorneys general to discuss whether tech giants may be hurting competition and 
intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms. 
• Facebook, Twitter, and Google were called to testify in front of the House and Senate 
about election interference, political bias, etc. Google declined to attend. 
• The FTC has begun a series of hearings on Digital Age antitrust, the first such 
hearings since the 1990s. 
• The FTC revealed the hiring of Lina Kahn—heralded for authoring a groundbreaking 
antitrust argument against Amazon—as an advisor. (See section 5 for more.) 
• Republican Senator Orrin Hatch asked the FTC to reopen a 2013 
antitrust case against Google. 
• Democratic Senator Mark Warner released a six-point policy proposal on regulating 
the tech industry. 
• Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders proposed the BEZOS Act, which would tax 
corporations one dollar for every dollar low-wage workers receive in government health-
care benefits or food stamps. 
• The E.U. Parliament voted 438 to 226 to back a draft proposal of 
copyright reformsthat will impose unprecedented liability on information platforms. 
• France is pushing to have Right to be Forgotten laws applied globally, 
which Google is now fighting in court. 
• Reports emerged that the E.U. is considering investigating Google's location-
tracking practices on data privacy grounds. 
We will continue to watch each development in the U.S. and E.U. closely to understand if 
and when debate turns to action. For now, we agree with the analysis of NYU Stern 
professor Scott Galloway, who told CNBC last week after the congressional hearings: 
I don't see anything meaningful coming out of this panel, much less Washington...D.C. 
lacks the domain expertise or the will to go after big tech. Where you may 
see it is, one, out of Brussels and, two, out of [the FTC, the DOJ, or] a red 
state whose attorney general sees the brightest path between the AG's mansion and the 
governor's mansion is a populist argument against big tech. 
Evidence of fundamental weakness could exacerbate the investor reaction to escalating 
regulatory news. By all accounts, Facebook has continued to bleed 
users. According to Pew Research poll results released earlier this month, more than a 
quarter of U.S. Facebook users claim to have deleted the app from their phones over the 
past year:

Then there's Apple. The trade war combined with China's slowing economy present a 
significant short-term threat to the company's profits. As we note in section 
1, smartphone handset sales in China in August were reported at 32.6 million 
units, a decline of 20.9% year-over-year and 11.8% month-on-
month. Moreover, no firm could suffer more if China decides to target tech 
supply chains in retaliation to Trump's tariffs. 
Yet, the risks extend beyond Asia. On Wednesday, Apple announced its newest generation 
of iPhones. It is following the same strategy as last year, releasing ever-more expensive 
phones as it tries to keep profit growth on pace despite a largely-matured smartphone 
market. As The Wall Street Journal reported this week, projections suggest last year's 
$1,000 iPhone X underperformed previous launches: Even for Apple and its devoted

We have roughly a month until 3Q18 earnings season begins. For years, big tech's 
remarkable profit trajectory has generated an air of invincibility. BAT's earnings miss 
combined with Facebook's earnings miss has cracked that expectation. As news reports

mount, the weeks to come could see that crack turn to a fissure.

In essence, the Iranian regime's approach toward sex, like its philosophy of governance, is
marked by maslahat, or expediency, and used alternately as a tool of suppression,
inducement, and incitement. In the summer of 2009, when hundreds of thousands of
Iranians took to the streets to protest Ahmadinejad's reelection, many protesters were
brutally beaten by the Basij militia, gangs of young regime thugs on motorbikes who were
given a green light to quell the uprising. As Iranian-American academic Shervin
Malekzadeh reported from Tehran, the Basij seemed to be driven by a combination of class
resentment and pent-up frustration. They don't screw; they don't drink or smoke joints,”

one of his sources told him. What else are they going to do with all of that energy?

But perhaps the seminal -- and most heartbreaking -- moment of the Green Revolution
was the murder of a 26-year-old female protester, Neda Agha-Soltan, whose bloody death
was caught on cell-phone camera and rendered one of the most viral videos in history. In
an HBO documentary about her life, Neda's mother recalls a message that some
sympathetic female Basij members relayed to Neda days before she was killed by a sniper:
Dear, please don't come out looking so beautiful.... Do us a favor and don't come out

because the Basiji men target beautiful girls. And they will shoot you.

While the iconic faces of Iran's 1979 revolution were bearded, middle-aged men, Neda has
come to symbolize the new face of dissent in 21st-century Iran: a young, modern, educated
woman. For her opposition to the regime and to the hijab, she is the embodiment of fitna

in Khamenei's eyes.

THREE SPRINGS LATER, the Iranian regime once again is faced with a crisis, this

time of an external variety. As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatens war
in between meals, the Pentagon plays war games and policy planners huddle in the White
House: Is the Iranian regime rational or irrational? Can diplomatic negotioations prevent

Iran from obtaining a bomb, or is an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities inevitable?

was activated to pressure the government to change position. Singapore’s experience in
2016-17 holds lessons for other ASEAN member states.

On the surface, China claims that it does not interfere in the internal affairs of other
states. At the same time, it is led by a Leninist party that embraces the ideas of the
United Front as a key tactic. Translated into foreign policy, by its nature United Front
work involves lobbying, coercion, co-optation and other influence operations—some
of which are legitimate, others of which are not. China’s self-declared role as the
representative of all Chinese people around the world and its stated position that all
Chinese are obliged to help China further complicate its position in Singapore, which
is 76 percent Chinese.

This multifaceted and contradictory approach is deployed within an overarching
narrative of China’s inevitable and unstoppable rise and America’s equally inevitable
and absolute decline. This narrative and others are propagated by various means:
WeChat with Chinese-speaking populations, social and mainstream media, whispering
campaigns, business, clan, and cultural associations, and conventional agents of
influence reporting to Chinese intelligence organizations, who cultivate what Lenin
called “useful idiots.”

A History of Influence

Chinese influence operations in Singapore are not a recent phenomenon. China’s
United Front activities in the late 1950s and 1960s sought to export China’s communist
revolution to Southeast Asia and were part of an open political struggle. But even after
China’s proxies in the political contest were defeated, China continued to try to shape
public opinion in Singapore. This attempt differed from the 2016-17 episode mainly in
the means deployed, which reflected the technologies available at the time.

On May 15, 1971, the Singapore government announced the arrest and detention of
three individuals under the Internal Security Act. The government press statement
revealed that “officials of a communist intelligence service based in Hong Kong”

had between 1964 and 1968 given loans totaling more than 7 million Hong Kong
dollars at the “ridiculously low interest rate of 0.1% per annum” to an ethnic Chinese
businessman to start an English-language daily newspaper named the Eastern Sun.' The
newspaper commenced publication in 1966. In return for the loans, the Eastern Sun was
required not to oppose the PRC on major issues and to remain neutral on minor issues.

In 2004, China deployed intense pressure on Singapore when then deputy prime
minister Lee Hsien Loong paid an unofficial visit to Taiwan. The Chinese were trying
to get Singapore to cancel the visit. Singapore adheres to a “One China Policy,” but if

ASSESS A FINE OF $250.00, RETROACTIVE TO JULY 17, 2008 IF
COMPLIANCE WAS NOT ACHIEVED

SECONDED BY MS. GREENBERG

MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY

VIII. Fine Reduction:

A. Case # 08-2301, 167 E. Inlet Drive, The Landfall Group,
Violation of Chapter 18, Section 18-242, Subsection 104.5.1.6, medium projects,
all new or remodel construction projects 4000 sq. ft, to 8,999 sq. ft. under roof be
allowed 22 months

Lead Code Enforcement Officer Walton said in October, 2007, Ajax Equity LLC
was found in violation of going over the construction time limits. On November
15, 2008 they still were not in compliance and a daily fine of $250.00 started
running. The final inspection was obtained in March, 2008. The fine ran for 137
days prior to compliance being achieved and the accumulated fine due is
$34,250.00 and the $150.00 hearing costs have not been paid.

Frank Lynch advised he was the attorney for both The Landfall Group and Ajax.

He said when they appeared before the Board in October, Lazslo Wagner, the
principal of The Landfall Group, who has built homes throughout the Town of
Palm Beach for 26 years acknowledged he was unaware of this particular code
provision. Had he been, they would have applied for an extension of time to
complete the construction. At the hearing, Mr. Koeppel made a motion to allow
them an additional sixty (60) days to complete the construction, find them in non-
compliance and assess the $150 costs. After a significant amount of discussion,
that motion went to a vote and failed 4-3. A second motion was made and Ms.
Duemler thought the $250.00 fee was significant and believed the fine should be
$125.00 a day. Mr. Lynch gave Mr. Walton a copy of that transcript to put in the
record. As part of their request, they are asking the Board to consider what Ms.
Duemler suggested at the meeting. At the same time, Mr. Lynch said he would like
them to consider that The Landfall Group is a good corporate citizen and made a
legitimate mistake. As a result, a fine was incurred and they are willing to accept
some level of fine, some level of responsibility for what they did. The construction
was continually on going, there were no delays other than the construction process
itself. This was not someone’s house, it was a speculative venture. There had
been some concerns with the shell contractor and the finish items themselves were
significant enough that there were substantial delays. At that same hearing, Code
Enforcement Officer Gerry said it was the position of Code Enforcement to get
more assertive at the suggestion of Town Council and that these projects were to
be more aggressively pursued. Under the new ordinance, for a house of
approximately 5,000 sq. feet, they would be entitled to 24 months. This would

2017 Global Commodity Outlook

After losing more than half its value in the span
of two years, the S&P GSCI broke its downward
trend with an 11% gain in 2016, its first double-
digit return since 2009 (see Exhibit 92). The
rebound in oil prices was a key contributor, as oil
finished the year with a staggering 52% spot price
gain—an outcome made all the more remarkable
by the fact that oil was down 25% at its worst
point early last year. This strength was not limited
to the oil patch, as industrial metals rallied 17%
on average and precious metals advanced 8% (see
Exhibit 93).

Despite last year’s broad-based gains, we are
more circumspect about the outlook for 2017.
While we expect oil to advance, it begins the
year closer to the midpoint of our target range,

Exhibit 93: Commodity Returns in 2016

Meanwhile, we believe the key elements of
our macroeconomic forecast—Federal Reserve
tightening, rising interest rates, modest US dollar
gains and average inflation—represent continued
headwinds to gold prices. Comparable headwinds
exist for industrial metals and agricultural goods,
given the continued slowdown we expect in
Chinese growth.

We discuss the specifics of our outlook for oil
and gold in the sections that follow.

front group, the Islamic State of Iraq, which deployed combat teams in
Fallujah last month that targeted Iraqi army positions and killed several
soldiers. The jihadists’ black flags have appeared at Sunni protests and
memorial ceremonies for the fallen. The group is back in the havens it
held in 2006. If Maliki does not allow proper Sunni representation in
government, al-Qaeda will gain greater popular tolerance and foreign
support.

Over the past year, the situation in Iraq has become explosive while
sectarian sentiment and armed violence in neighboring nations have
escalated dramatically. Americans have become accustomed to watching
Iraq approach the precipice and draw back. But circumstances have
changed with the withdrawal of all U.S. forces and Maliki’s year-long
efforts to intimidate his opponents through political, judicial and military
maneuvers. If Maliki does not accept many of the protesters’ reasonable
demands and allow meaningful Sunni participation in government,
prospects for stopping Iraq’s descent into sectarian conflict are grim.

Fig. 5 The Repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma. Two players play a Prisoner’s Dilemma. They each
observe the other’s action, then, with probability 6, play another Prisoner’s Dilemma against the
same opponent, etc.

Technically, for the second and third point, what is needed is common knowI-
edge that a player had an opportunity to cooperate or of the more effective means of
cooperation. If observers were to know one purposely chose to defect or chose the
less cooperative act, but they do not know that others know this, then observers
think others will think punishment is not warranted, and observers will not punish.
The argument is analogous to the discussion of higher-order beliefs in the omis-
sion—commission subsection and formalized in Dalkiran et al. (2012) and Hoffman
et al. (2015).

Interpreting the Quirks of Altruism

Below we discuss some of the quirky features of altruism identified by economists
and psychologists. In each case, we will argue that these features might be puzzling,
but not when viewed through the lens of the above model:

Insensitivity to Effectiveness. We are surprisingly insensitive to the impact of our
charitable contributions. We vote because we “want to be a part of the democratic sys-
tem,” or we “want to make a difference,” despite the fact that our likelihood of swinging
an election (even in a swing state) is smaller than our likelihood of being struck by
lightning (Gelman, Silver, & Edlin, 2012). Why is our desire to “make a difference” or
“be a part of the system’ immune to the actual difference we are making? Our chari-
table contributions or volunteer efforts suffer from the same insensitivity. Why does
anyone give money or volunteer time to Habitat for Humanity? The agency flies high
eamers who have never held a hammer halfway across the world to build houses that
would be substantially more cheaply built by local experts funded by the high earners.
Experimental evidence demonstrates our insensitivity: Experimental subjects are will-
ing to pay the same amount to save 2000, 20,000, or 200,000 birds (Desvousges et al.,
2010). Likewise, when donors are told their donations will be matched, tripled, or
quadrupled, they donated identical amounts (Karlan & List, 2006). Why do we give so
much, but do not ensure our gifts have a large impact?

The explanation follows directly from the above model: It is often the case that
observers do not know which acts are effective and which are not and, certainly, this

game that got rained out half way through. We ran to the train station only to find no one tending
the token booth. My uncle had one token and so the two of us squeezed through the turnstile on
his one token. As soon as we got home he took a dime, put it in an envelope and sent it to the
transit authority, apologizing profusely for temporarily cheating them of their dime. A year later
he did the same thing, but on a much larger scale. My Uncle Itchie stowed away on a ship headed
for Palestine in order to participate in Israel’s struggle for statehood. He did not have enough
money for passage, so he hid in a closet during the nearly month long trip, getting food from a
friend who was paying his own way over. My Uncle then swam from the ship to shore, evading
British authorities. After working for several months he then sent the full fare for the lowest class
of service to the shipping company. Those were the values with which I was brought up. You do
what you have to do, but then you pay your debts.

Religion in my home was not a matter of faith or an accepted theology. To this day, I have no
idea what my parents believed about the nature of God, the literal truth of the Bible, heaven and
hell, or other issues so central to most religions. Ours was a religion of practice and rules—of
required acts and omissions. A cartoon I once saw perfectly represented my parents approach to
religion. It showed a father dragging his reluctant young son in the direction of the synagogue
and saying:

“Atheist, Shmathiest, I don’t care—as long as you come to shul.”

Our Judaism was entirely rule bound. Before every activity, there was a required “brucha”—a
formulistic blessing appropriate to the activity. “Baruch ata Adonoy”—“blessed be you our
God”—followed by a reference to His creation: “who brings forth bread from the earth” or “wine
from the grapes” or “fruit from the trees” or “produce from the ground.” Then there was a
generic brucha that covered everything not included among the specific blessing: “Sheh-hakol
Nihiye B’Dvaroh.” My grandmother Ringel, who was the religious enforcer in the family, would
ask demandingly, if she saw me drinking a glass of water, “Did you make a “shakel,” referring to
the previously mentioned generic blessing. My grandmother, who spoke no Hebrew, probably
had no idea of the literal meaning of the blessing, but she knew—and insisted that I knew—you
had to recite it (even just mumble it) before you drank the water.

There were rules for everything. If you accidentally used a “milichdika” (dairy) fork on a
“flayshidika” (meat) item, the offending (or offended) item had to be buried in the earth for
exactly seven days. That restored its kosher quality by “kashering” it. After eating meat, we had
to wait precisely 6 hours before eating dairy—after eating dairy, however, you had to wait only
half an hour to eat meat, but a full hour if the “dairy” meal contained fish. Not a minute less.
When my parents told me the rules of swimming after eating—wait two hours after a heavy meal,
one hour after a light meal, half an hour after a piece of fruit and 15 minutes after a Hershey
bar—lI thought these were religious rules, because they paralleled the rules about how long you
had to wait between meat and dairy. (I later learned that the swimming rules were based neither
on religion, nor upon science, but rather on questionable “folk wisdom.”)

From my earlier days, I accepted the highly technical, rule-oriented religious obligations imposed

on me by my parents and grandparents. It was a lot easier for me to obey rules—even if I didn’t
understand the reasons, if any, behind them—than to accept a theology that was always somewhat

have interference you sometimes get constructive interference — the
double crest or trough — and sometimes destructive interference — the
crest and trough canceling each other.

The reason we don’t see this effect in every reflection is because of
imperfection. Windows are not perfectly flat and light is multicolored, so
the effect is hard to see. But it is definitely there, and if you look really hard
at a reflection in a window, you can sometimes see it at the boundary of
sharp objects. The effect is very clear in the next picture which has been
set up with two flat pieces of glass resting against each other. There is a
tiny air gap between them. It is also commonly seen on puddles in cities.
In this case the puddle usually has a slight film of oil on it. Unlike glass,
puddles are perfectly flat thanks to gravity, but the oil film is thick in the
center and thin at the edges. The light reflecting off a puddle will show a
rainbow of colors. This is because each color is giving us a pattern of light
and dark. If you look at the same puddle at night in a yellow streetlight,
you will just see a monochrome pattern of light and dark. Look at the
picture of waves on a pond.

The patterns of light and dark are usually explained by imagining
the photons interfere with each other. This explanation is insufficient.
Imagine for a moment you can see as well as a frog, and perceive one

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018672.txt,"There are a lot of things about pickup artistry that I really do not like. There were points
during my PUA adventures when I learned about incidents and strategies that blatantly
sound like rape. This is a huge can of worms, and I discussed it at great length in my
book. For now I will only note that there is an entire PUA area of inquiry called Last
Minute Resistance (or LMR): that is, what happens when a woman resists having sex.
Last Minute Resistance tactics (LMR tactics) are designed to convince a woman who
has expressed hesitance, distaste or discomfort to have sex anyway.

The first two 'no's don't mean much, and should be expected,” advises one PUA while
outlining LMR tactics. This is exactly the kind of thing that gives the community a bad
name. In fairness, some PUAs talk about trying to understand why a girl is
uncomfortable, and then addressing the root cause of her discomfort. For example, a PUA
might advise asking whether she is menstruating, and then reassuring her that he won't be
grossed out by having sex if she is. Some PUAs try to claim that most LMR tactics are
harmless and communicative, but this is a difficult claim to defend. I have always been
more impressed by the few PUAs who simply advocate respecting Last Minute
Resistance, such as David Shade:

Do not push against last minute resistance. You will be like all the other guys who
objectify women and do not respect her as a real person. And it will reek of desperation.

... In fact, move things along just slightly slower than she'd like it. Make her wait. It
builds that sexual tension, and it makes her think. When she is away from you, she is
going to think about it a lot.

Of course, while Shade is advising his clients to respect boundaries, he's advising them to
respect boundaries as a tactic for seducing the woman eventually. Another example of
this approach comes from Mark Manson, who appears more interested in respecting
women for the sake of respecting women, but whose main thrust is still seduction advice:

In [an LMR situation], there's always a fork in the road: you can do the typical freeze-
out/high-pressure PUA bullshit to try to manipulate her or annoy her into giving up the
resistance. Or you can be honest about the situation and resign yourself to accepting the
fact that you may not have sex tonight.

Guys, listen. Always, always, always go with the second option. It may sound counter-
intuitive, but you have to go with the second option. Not only because it's the right thing
to do. Not only because it's what any respectful human being should do. But because if
you make it clear that there is absolutely no pressure for her to sleep with you, if you
Show her that you can be trusted and that you're OK with whatever she decides (and by
the way, you do need to be OK with whatever she decides), then she's going to become
ten times more comfortable with you, and therefore is actually more likely to WANT to
have sex with you.

PUA frameworks and tactics are often consent-friendly. Many LMR tactics encourage
pushiness or even outright non-consensual behavior, such as ignoring the woman when
she says, No. Yet things I discussed in previous sections of this article — such as negs,”
and body-language kino tactics -- are clearly neutral: their usage is shaped mostly by
the goals of individual PUAs and the social context in which they occur. Discussions of

The Chicago Social Brain
Network was established to examine
how science might inform us about our
fundamental human nature, including the
apparently irrepressible quest for
connection with a higher understanding
and organization. Science can describe
what religion does in rigorous ways that
benefit religion, and religion can serve a
meaning-making function that science
itself disclaims. This is not to say that
science can address the existence of
God. Our Network instead focuses on
the consequences of believing in such a
mind and of seeing into that mind.

In the next chapter, John
Cacioppo, a social neuroscientist, draws
on work on evolutionary theory,
sociobiology, and evolutionary
psychology to examine the implications
of the selfish gene hypothesis for Homo
sapiens. He shows how the notion of the
selfish gene has been joined with
political theory, consumerism, and
economics to produce a dominant
modern image of humans summarized
by the phrase “what is best for me is best
for the society.” Without rejecting the
selfish gene view, Cacioppo shows how
it evolves in humans into what he calls
the “social brain’— a large cerebral
cortex and an interconnected limbic
lobule that together are sensitive to the
complexities of physical and social
environments. Central to this
complexity is the long period of
dependency of the human infant and the
interdependencies of adult humans for
survival especially in hostile
environments (e.g., warfare). For the
selfish gene to contribute its DNA to the
ongoing gene pool, the individual must
not only reproduce but also cooperate
with others to assure that his or her

offspring also grow to maturity and
reproduce. This leads to natural
selection choosing those genes and
capacities that contribute to cooperation,
reciprocity, attachments, and generosity.
Over the millennia of human evolution,
this process has created the social brain

Palestinian architect of Oslo, was with him, along with a more junior aide who
served the tea and sweets. At least this time, Arafat didn’t take notes as we spoke.
The mood was friendly. We talked about a whole range of issues. With ony one
exception: what was really happening, or what should happen, in the summit talks.
I found the exercise disappointing as a result. But Yossi Ginossar assured me it
would help the atmosphere, and would eventually translate into negotiating
progress. “I hope so,” I said.

It wasn’t until day-four that real talks began. The Americans arranged for
negotiating teams from both sides on borders, the refugee issue, and Jerusalem to
meet with President Clinton. The Palestinians participated, but showed no sign at
all of a readiness to compromise. Borders should have been the most
straightforward. Assuming we wanted a deal, it was about sitting down with a map
and working out how to address both sides’ arguments. But Arafat’s representative
in the meeting — the Oslo negotiator Abu Ala’a — said he wouldn’t even discuss
borders without a prior agreement to land swaps ensuring Palestinian control over
an area equivalent to 100 percent of the West Bank. Shlomo Ben-Ami did try to
find a way around this. He suggested the Palestinians assume that to be the case for
the purposes of the meeting, so that at least there could be meaningful discussion
of the border, including the provisions Israel wanted in order to retain the major
settlement blocks. President Clinton agreed that made sense. He said that without
talking about the substance of such issues, there wasn’t going to be a deal. Even
Abu Ala’a seemed receptive, according to Shlomo. But he insisted that he would
have to ask Arafat first whether it was okay.

On refugees, pretty much the same thing happened. The Americans, and I
assumed at that point even the Palestinians, knew that a peace deal would be
impossible if we agreed to hundreds of thousands of refugees entering Israel — in
effect leaving the state created in 1948 with a Jewish minority. But when President
Clinton began trying to narrow down details of a compromise resettlement package
— how many refugees would return, where they would go, and how to arrange
international financial support for them — Abu Mazen insisted that nothing could
be discussed until without a prior Israeli acceptance of the “principle of the right of
return.” On Jerusalem, according to Gilead Sher, the President didn’t even try to
find common ground on the core issue: sovereignty. Instead he used the formula
Shlomo Ben-Ami had suggested, telling each side to proceed on the assumption
sovereignty was decided in its favour, and to concentrate instead on how everyday

2003 Yale University address on “Global Challenges,” he said:

If you believe that maintaining power and control and absolute freedom of
movement and sovereignty is important to your country’s future, there’s
nothing inconsistent in that [the US continuing to behaving unilaterally ].
[The US is] the biggest, most powerful country in the world now. .. . But
if you believe that we should be trying to create a world with rules and
partnerships and habits of behavior that we would like to live in when
we're no longer the military political economic superpower in the world,
then you wouldn’t do that. It just depends on what you believe.

Long before 2003, Clinton wanted to begin preparing Americans for this
new world. “Clinton believed [...] what we had in the wake of the cold
war was a multilateral moment — an opportunity to shape the world
through our active leadership of the institutions Clinton admired and
[Charles] Krauthammer disdained,” writes Strobe Talbott, former deputy
secretary of state in his book The Great Experiment: The Story of Ancient
Empires, Modern States, and the Quest for a Global Nation. “But Clinton
kept that belief largely to himself while he was in office.... political
instincts told him it would be inviting trouble to suggest that the sun
would someday set on American preeminence.” Sadly, few Americans
have heeded Clinton’s wisdom. Few dare to mention that America could
well be number two. I discovered this when I chaired a panel on “the
future of American power” at the 2012 World Economic Forum in Davos.
After citing projections that America would have the second largest
economy in just a few years, I asked the American panelists — two
senators, a congresswoman and a former deputy national security advisor
— whether Americans are ready to become number two. To my shock,
none could acknowledge publically this possibility.

America may well become number two faster than anyone has anticipated.
According to the most recent International Monetary Fund (IMF)
projections, China will have larger share of global GDP than the United
States by 2017. In 1980, in PPP terms, the US share of the global economy
was 25 percent, while China’s was 2.2 percent. By 2017, the US share will
decline to 17.9 percent, and China’s will rise to 18.3 percent. Even if

that word, at least to my family) Uncle Hedgie, who you always knew exactly what he was
thinking.

When I began teaching at age 25, some of my more proper students objected to my constant
interruptions, until I persuaded them that being interrupted was a compliment, signifying that their
point had been made and understood. (We get it.) Some televisions viewers have also written
to me about my penchant for interrupting opposing talking heads. It's simply a matter of style,
not rudeness, though some mistake the former for the latter.

Another blessing of my early religious training relates to memory and my use of it in my
professional life. My mother was blessed (cursed?) with a near perfect memory. (Probably more
nature than nurture.) She could recall virtually everything from her youth. When she was in her
80s, she would spot someone on the train and go over to her and ask her “Aren’t you Mildred
Cohen and weren’t you in my sixth grade class?” She was invariably right. She remembered,
word for word, what she had been taught in the third or fourth grade. She remembered every
melody she had ever learned, even though she never went to concerts and didn’t listen to
recordings as an adult. She could recite from memory long poems she learned in elementary
school. Most surprising of all, she had committed to memory an entire Latin mass, which a
Catholic elementary schoolteacher, in an effort to Americanize the children of immigrants, had
made her learn by heart. She had no idea what it meant, but it was one of her favorite parlor
tricks to repeat its Latin words, accompanied by the church melody she had learned. She never
forgot anything she had heard, read or smelled. Growing up with a mother who never forgot was
a curse for me, because I did a good many things I wish she could forget.

Although I always knew I had a good memory, I discovered that I had inherited my mother’s
extraordinary gift while participating in intercollegiate debates. The debate tournaments always
took place on Saturday. I pleaded with my parents to let me go, promising that I would travel
before the Sabbath and after the Sabbath, and that I would say my prayers wherever I happened
to be. My parents agreed on the condition that I not write during the Sabbath. (“Meturnished”)
My mother told me it wasn’t necessary to write because I could remember things that others had
to write down. (“Our family has good memories.”) I was doubtful but it proved to be true. I
became a champion debater and my teammates marveled at the fact that I didn’t bring a pencil or
pad but could recite word for word what my opponent had said before responding to it. I then
realized what a blessing this memory was. I went through the rest of college and law school
without ever taking a note. This enabled me to listen very carefully to what was being taught and
to have a far better understanding of it than the student “stenographers” who were busy taking
down every word the teacher said, as if putting it in writing was a substitute for understanding it.
To this day, I rarely take notes, even in court, though my memory for new information is not
nearly as good as it used to be.

Recently, after watching the film Invictus, my wife asked me if I had any idea who wrote the
poem by that name. She thought it must be a well known poet, such as Byron or Shelly. Without
thinking, I blurted out Henley. She replied who the hell is Henley? I said, I don't have the
slightest idea, but I think Invictus was written by some English poet named Henley. She
checked Google and sure enough the poem was written by a relatively obscure Victorian poet
named William Ernst Henley (1849-1903), who wrote little else of note. His name popped into

A guess would mean particles have free will; no extraneous
influence or piece of information either on their person or from some
external source could have any effect. We are now going to prove the
particle does guess.

The Proof
Conway and Kochen construct their proof from a small set of axioms,
which form a rhyme. The axioms are; twin, fin and spin.

If two particles are separated by a distance (fin) and entangled
(twin), the spins of the particles (spin) cannot be determined by any
information in their history of the Universe up to that point. The proof
relies on a thought experiment.

Consider twin particles separated by a long distance. Physicists call
this ‘space like separation. All this means is one particle is measured on, say,
Earth and the other on Mars, so relativity is significant in the experiment.
This may be impractical today but there is no reason the experiment
could not be done in principle. In the future, our children could set up
on the UN Moon base and fire one photon to a detector on Hubble II
and the other to the future Mars Orbital Station. Farfetched? If you had
told Einstein back in 1947 that in less than 70 years we would be able
to measure individual photons by sending them down spun glass fibers
to locations separated by 50 kilometers, involving a multidisciplinary
team composed of American, German, French and Russian scientists, all
working in harmony, he might have been equally incredulous.

As the proof introduces relativity we also need two imaginary
rocket ships. They must be traveling below the speed of light, so no Star
Trek Enterprise or Millennium Falcon. We will have to stick with an old-
school spaceship, the Sulaco from Aliens should do the trick. They must
travel in opposite directions, passing our Moon Base just as the scientists
run the experiment.

Special Relativity shows our Universe has a strange property: there
is no such thing as a simultaneous event for two observers — at least if
they are separated by any distance. From the point of view of the first
spaceship, the measurement on Mars occurs first. But from the vantage
point of the second observer, the measurement on Hubble occurs first.

Now comes the proof by counter example. Let us suppose the
particles were influenced by an outside effect and had no free will.

that he “had been talking some of the more technical guys at work
into setting up some additional fast servers” for Tor. His “work”
place at the time was the NSA. So, if he was telling the truth, he
had already attempted to find co-workers at the NSA who might be
interested in attending an anti-NSA surveillance presentation.

Sandvik not only agreed to be Snowden’s co-presenter but made
the Oahu CryptoParty a Tor-sponsored event. Sandvik flew to
Honolulu on December 6, 2012. It was a fourteen-hour flight and
a relatively expensive one. She later told Wired magazine that the
invitation from Snowden coincided with her plan to take a “vacation
in Hawaii.” Whatever her reason, it brought her in direct contact
with a Tor supporter with access to the computers of its main enemy,
the NSA.

On December 11, following Snowden’s instructions, Sandvik
arrived shortly before 6:00 p.m. at the Fishcake gallery in downtown
Honolulu. She proceeded through a maze of furniture display rooms
to BoxJelly, a public space. She was then directed to a small back room
in which there were folding chairs and worktables already set up for

© the event. Rechung Fujihira, the owner of BoxfJelly, told me that Hi ©
Capacity, a “creative collective” of computer buffs, had arranged the
logistics for the event. As he recalled, Snowden had requested their
help for the CryptoParty.

Sandvik found Snowden waiting for her with Lindsay Mills,
whom he introduced to Sandvik as his girlfriend. He told Sandvik
that Mills was there to make a video of the event. Mills did not men-
tion the party in her blog. But that Snowden brought her and intro-
duced her to Sandvik suggests that he did not keep secret from her
his activities to further Tor.

The event started at 6:00 p.m. sharp. By Sandvik’s count, about
twenty people gradually filled the room. She reckoned that about
half of the attendees were from Snowden’s workplace. Snowden
began the presentation by giving reasons why Internet users needed
to defend their privacy by using both encryption and Tor software.
According to one attendee who asked not to be identified by name,
Snowden, while not revealing that he worked for the NSA, spoke
with such precise knowledge about government surveillance capa-

excited disapproval.

Mysterious are the conditions of attentive (preoccupied) and none attentive,
(fugued out) disappearing time. | found a musical way for it to happen when
improvising: continue to shuffle a small set of notes that stay within the melodic field
of the tonal center of an unchanging tonic chord. In contrast, most melodies and
their chords leave the tonal center to which they return in harmonic and melodic
progression. We can call these conventional tonal centers unstable fixed points.
They are attractive repellers of melodic and harmonic expectation. It has been
mathematically proven that these hyperbolic systems are globally stable. In
contrast, a melody that remains stuck in the tonic chord, a purely contracting stable
fixed point, is technically a chant. Paradoxically, it can be shown that this kind of
fixed point is globally unstable. Rigid things can more easily fracture. The rich,
altered states of consciousness that emerge while hearing the beat of Tibetan
monks meditating, the Sufi chant-dances of Rumi and the John Coltrane and
McCoy Tyner’s endless, single chord, tenor/piano dialogues exemplify the
bifurcation to hallucinatory new stuff arising spontaneously from the experience of
unchanging repetition. Constant repetition of the conditioned (expected) stimulus
drove Pavlov’s dogs, especially those with “nervous temperaments,” into frozen,
catatonic states. Abulafia’s 1280 book on ecstatic techniques, Hayyei Ha’Olam
HaBa, recommended the recitative rearranging of a finite set of Hebrew letters,
frontward and backward, many times, using prayer melodies, until “...the heart will
suddenly become aware of the intellectual, divine and prophetic...” and hitbodedut
will rest upon him. The instructions were “...combine letters (and associated musical
notes)... reversing and rolling them around rapidly until one’s heart begins to feel

wasn’t enough, David Levy, my Foreign Minister, told me he would not be joining
me at Camp David. He wasn’t resigning, at least not yet. But he knew that the final
decisions at the summit would be mine, he feared it would fail, and didn’t want to
share in the consequences.

None of this meant I wasn’t going. Even if the no-confidence vote succeeded,
the new Israeli electoral system, with its separate vote for Prime Minister, meant I
would remain in office, at least until the summit was over. In a nationally televised
message, I reminded the country that I’d been elected with nearly two million
votes. I felt I had a responsibility, and a mandate, that went beyond party politics.
“T must rise above the political arguments, and seek out all possibilities on the way
to a peace agreement that will end the conflict, and the blood, between us and our
neighbors.” I made the same points before the Knesset. I did, of course, want
parliamentary support. But I was acting on a mandate from the people of Israel. It
was they, in a referendum, who would ultimately decide on anything we might
agree. When the Knesset votes were counted, thanks to the fact two dozen MKs
abstained, both sides lost. Arik fell seven votes short of a majority. So the
government survived. But those opposed to the summit got more votes than we
did: 54 to 52.

There were several consolations as I prepared to fly out from Ben-Gurion
airport. Shas leader Eli Yishai passed me an envelope on the tarmac. Inside was a
note from Rabbi Ovadia Yossef, the Shas spiritual leader whom I’d met with
privately after the election and a number of times since. He wanted to wish me
good luck. Nearly 30 reserve generals also issued a public message of support.
Perhaps most encouragingly, a newspaper poll found a majority of Israelis — 55
percent to 45 — believed I was right to go to Camp David and that I had a mandate
to make concessions in return for peace.

David Levy came over to talk before I boarded. “I doubt we’ll get an
agreement,” he said. I told him what I was telling other ministers, what I’d told
reporters and, in fact what I had told Nava. “The odds are fifty-fifty.” The reporters
took this as coy, or deliberately deceptive. So I added that it was not because I
knew something they didn’t. “It’s because there are two possible outcomes, and I
don’t know which one will happen.” The gaps of substance were bridgeable. The
question was whether both sides wanted peace, and whether each had made a
serious, strategic decision to go for it. I’d made that choice. But I had no way of
knowing whether Yasir Arafat had.

to a charge that the State Attorney has not, despite a two year investigation, determined to be
appropriate. Mr. Epstein’s counsel must also successfully expedite a plea of guilty to this charge
on a date prior to July 8, 2008, which is the date presently set by the state court Judge.

Further, the unnecessary deadline is even more problematic because Mr. Epstein’s effort
to reconcile the state charge and sentence with the terms of the Agreement requires an unusual
and unprecedented threatened application of federal law. Thus, it places Mr. Epstein in the
highly unusual position of having to demand that the State acquiesce to a more severe
punishment than it had already determined was appropriate.

We have attempted to resolve these and other issues through the USAO and CEOS,
including raising our concerns about the USAO’s inappropriate conduct with respect to this
matter. But those avenues have now been shut down. Mr. Sloman’s letter purports to prohibit
any further contact between Mr. Epstein’s defense team and U.S. Attorney Acosta, and instead
requires us to communicate with the USAO only though Mr. Sloman’s subordinates.

While it pains us to say this, this misguided prosecution from the outset gives the
appearance that it may have been politically motivated. Mr. Epstein is a highly successful, self-
made businessman and philanthropist who entered the public arena only by virtue of his close
personal association with former President Bill Clinton. There is little doubt in our minds that
the USAO never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case if Mr. Epstein were just
another “John.”

U.S. Attorney Acosta previously has stated that he is “sympathetic” to our federalism-
related concerns, but he has taken the position that his authority is limited by enforcement
policies set forth in Washington, D.C. As expressed in our prior communication to you, we
believe that a complete and independent appraisal and resolution of this case most appropriately
would be undertaken by your Office—beginning with the rescission of the arbitrary, unfair, and
unprecedented deadline that Mr. Sloman demands to have imposed in this case. At the very
least, we would appreciate a tolling of the arbitrary timeline imposed on our client by the USAO
in order to allow time for your office to consider our request that you undertake a review of this
case.

Thank you for your time and attention.

near disputed islands in the South China Sea.

China responded to frenetic protests from Vietnam and the
Philippines that any exploration in the Spratly area without its
consent is a violation of its jurisdiction and sovereignty. This real
time link between its stark and sweeping position and its enforcement
has sent a chill down the spines of other ASEAN claimant and drawn
U.S. attention. These disputes and even such incidents are certainly
not new but why are they occurring now, and why is China sending
very mixed signals?

This was supposed to be a period of negotiations to transform the
DOC into an official enforceable code. Needless to say, this effort
may now be moribund.

Despite China's rhetoric, ASEAN nations are genuinely alarmed and
are looking to the United States for succor and support. The U.S. —
having confronted China and injected itself into the issue via U.S.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's speech at the ARF Foreign
Minister's meeting in Hanoi in July 2010 — is only too happy to help —
at least verbally and with signals that militaries understand.

The great irony is that none of this was necessary for China. Its
problem with the U.S., or vice versa, concerns the intelligence-
gathering activities of U.S. military vessels and aircraft — the EP-3,
the Impeccable, the Victorious, the Bowditch in what it claims 1s its
waters — not conflicting claims to islands or ocean space. These can
only be linked in one worst scenario: that China has decided that it
disagrees with portions of the U.N. Law of the Sea Treaty that it

history even once in a twenty-page subcommittee report, in four pages of minutes of its discussions, or in twenty-six pages of
proposed amendments and accompanying Advisory Committee Notes. °° Perhaps the Advisory Committee took a different
approach than the CVRA's drafters because it did not consider their stated intentions.

If, on the other hand, the Advisory Committee was aware of the drafters’ intentions and declined to follow them, it is staking
out a rather unusual path. It is standard practice for the Advisory Committee, no less than courts, to look to legislative history in
crafting the Rules. 8? With respect to the CVRA in particular, many courts have found the CVRA's legislative history highly
instructive. They have good reason for relying on the history. Unlike some contentious pieces of legislation where legislators
possessed divergent views, the CVRA enjoyed a broad, bi-partisan consensus. *° It passed by a vote of 393 to 14 in the
House °! and by a voice vote in the Senate. ?? Moreover, the CVRA's cosponsors were bipartisan, and the views they gave on
the legislation were not contradicted by anyone else. Thus, as the Ninth Circuit has explained in construing the CVRA to track
Senator Kyl's and Feinstein's views:

Floor statements by the sponsors of the legislation are given considerably more weight than floor statements by other members,
and they are given even more weight where, as here, other legislators did not offer any contrary views. Silence, the maxim
goes, connotes assent, and so we can draw from the fact that no one registered disagreement with Senators Kyl and Feinstein on
this point the reasonable inference that the views they expressed reflected a consensus, at least in the Senate. 7?

In light of all this, it is beyond doubt that crime victims have a substantive right to be treated with fairness (as well as with
respect for their dignity and [*877] privacy) in the federal criminal justice process. Once that right is in mind, the Advisory
Committee has clear duties under the Rules Enabling Act. That Act provides that the Rules shall not abridge, enlarge or
modify any substantive right. °4 Therefore, if any existing rule of criminal procedure abridges or even modifies a victim's
rights to fairness, it is invalid and must be changed. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee must review all the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure to ensure that they protect victims’ right to fairness.

B. The Advisory Committee Treats the Right to Fairness Inconsistently

The Advisory Committee claimed that to implement the right to fairness would use the right as a springboard for a variety of
victim rights not otherwise provided for in the CVRA. * If so, the Advisory Committee was unable to consistently follow its
own view. The Advisory Committee agreed with my proposed change to Rule 18; that change required that when a court
determines where within a judicial district to hold a trial, it should consider not only the convenience of the defendant and the

work their way backward, molding their perception of reality like Silly Putty

Maxwell continued: “About ten years ago, a young black man
broke into the Queen Mum’ s bedroom, and one of her servants
happened to be walking by and the bedroom door was open a bit, and
she saw this young black boy in the queen’ s bedroom. She quietly went
to security which came up and arrested him for breaking into the queen’ s
bedroom, but the queen said he didn’ t threaten her and he wasn’ t
armed and it was just a childish silly prank, and so she let it slide if he
promised not to do that any more. James Bond couldn’ t break into the

bedroom in Buckingham Palace, the queen ordered him in like pizza. The

as publicly traded companies, but ordinarily will market its securities using a private placement mem-
orandum (PPM) that includes information similar to some of the information required to be disclosed
by publicly traded companies. An issuer in a private placement is subject to liability under federal secu-
rities laws for misrepresentation or fraudulent statements made in a PPM or otherwise in connection
with the private offering.

By all indications, federal securities laws do not prohibit companies engaged in federally illegal
cannabis activities from raising capital through the issuance of securities, nor do they prohibit industry
participants like stock exchanges and investment banks from performing their ordinary market func-
tions in connection with such companies. The SEC has allowed the registration and sale of securities
offered by companies engaged in federally illegal cannabis activities and the trading of those securities
on multiple U.S. stock markets. Although the SEC has on occasion suspended trading in some of
these securities, those suspensions generally have been due to alleged violations of securities regulations
rather than unlawful cannabis activities.

A cannabis company offering or selling securities must comply with federal securities laws—like
any other issuer—by making required notice or registration filings and by providing truthful material
information to investors. Any discussion of risks delivered to investors, whether required by securities
laws or volunteered by the issuer as part of a private offering, should include a thorough discussion of
the unique risks posed by operating a cannabis business engaged in federally illegal conduct. For an
example of some of these risks, refer to Chapter IX, Cannabis Industry Risk Factors.

Federal Bankruptcy Law

Bankruptcy is a legal proceeding by which a debtor resolves its debt obligations and creditors are
afforded certain rights in the debtor’s assets in full or partial satisfaction of the debts owed to them. In
the United States, bankruptcy is governed primarily by the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 (Bank-
ruptcy Code). Bankruptcy proceedings are conducted primarily by federal bankruptcy courts and gen-
erally involve administration of a debtor's assets either by a court-appointed trustee or by the debtor
with approval and oversight of the court. Bankruptcy can be voluntary (initiated by the debtor) or
involuntary (initiated by creditors), Bankruptcy provides certain rights and protections to the debtor
and the creditors and is intended to fairly and finally resolve debts so the parties can pursue other

affairs.

Debtors whose assets relate to federally illegal cannabis activity, as well as their creditors, gener-
ally are not eligible for bankruptcy protection for two reasons: First, federal courts refuse to appoint
trustees to administer or take control of unlawful assets or business operations. Second, pursuant to
an equitable doctrine known as “unclean hands,” federal courts typically decline to honor creditor
claims that arise from knowingly transacting with a debtor in furtherance of unlawful activity. A federal
bankruptcy court in Arizona invoked both these reasons in its 2015 decision in In Re Medpoint Man-
agement, LLC; details of this case follow.

Medpoint Management, LLC (Medpoint) managed the cultivation and business operations of a
state-legal Arizona medical cannabis dispensary. Medpoint defaulted under various loan and consulting
agreements directly related to its dispensary activities, and the four creditors under those agreements

REPEAT Violation of Chapter 42, Section 42-86 of the Town of Palm Beach
Code of Ordinances, Environment, properties to be maintained in a good
condition.

Code Enforcement Officer Weymer presented the facts of the case and said the
violation was discovered from routine patrol in the area but shortly after the notice
of repeat violation was sent out, a citizen complaint was received as well. Mr.
Weymer said there had been at least seven previous letters to this property owner
regarding lack of maintenance on the property. A repeat notice of code violation
was mailed out on June 24, 2008 with a mandatory hearing date. The lot was cut
on or around July 2, 2008. This particular violation is a Class I violation under
the fine schedule which calls for a fine of $400.00, however, by law, the Board has
the ability to impose a fine of up to $500.00 because it is a repeat violation. Mr.
Weymer said he believes it is important to look at the track record of this property
in considering the fine. The Town recommends a finding of non-compliance,
administrative costs in the amount of $150.00 and a fine of $500.00, which is the
maximum fine for a repeat violation.

Mr. Hoffman said it seemed that every time the property owner gets notified he
comes into compliance but he has to be notified. Mr. Weymer says there are times
when he comes into compliance but on at least two other occasions, he has been
before the Board because he has not complied by the time set. Mr. Ochstein asked
if he has been fined in the past and Mr. Weymer said there are two outstanding
fines for which liens have been placed on the property.

Local issues must be monitored and understood, though, to decide how to
allocate capital and risk. Just to review a few, Japanese policy makers
continue to present a concerted plan to reflate their economy through
monetary, fiscal and structural measures. The strong control of the
government and its high approval rating are steadily raising the chance of
success. We stay overweight Japanese equities and grow wary of the short yen
trade, as capital inflows and rising growth expectations (chart of right) are
ultimately bullish for the currency. Watch next week’s BoJ meeting, led by
newly appointed Governor Kuroda, for new reflationary measures.

The Euro area economy remains in recession, while policy makers are
making little effort to reverse the contraction. We monitor signs of any large
deposit flight post Cyprus over coming weeks and months to judge whether
the bailout may actually be worsening conditions in the Euro. Economic
forecast momentum remains negative (chart of right). These are good reasons
to underweight the Euro area, if not all of Europe, across asset classes, against
the rest of the world.

The US, in contrast, is seeing better spending from both corporates and
consumers than we could have expected post Fiscal Cliff and sequestration.
But given the huge amount of fiscal drag, which is a fact, we want to see
another 1-2 months of data before extrapolating the good news. It did support
US equities in recent weeks, which continue to benefit from US corporates
issuing debt to buy their own shares and others', through M&A. This corporate
rotation from debt to equities is almost exclusively a US flow, which helps
explain US equity outperformance.

Across risk assets, we are similarly seeing huge delinking, with equities
rallying greatly and commodities and credit seeing no gains (chart p. 1), very
much unlike last year. Commodities are delinking as there are no growth
upgrades in EM, and inflation concerns are concentrated on two countries, UK
and Japan. Credit is delinking as most investors are massively overweight
credit versus equities, as evidenced by the disparity in buying flows in 2011-
12. Relevering by US corporate and the Fed debating the end of QE are
signaling that the 3-decade long rally in bonds is likely over. Investors are
starting to dollar-average away from bonds to equities.

Fixed Income

Bonds rallied again, except for Euro area peripherals, the source of this
week’s market concerns. The imposition of capital controls on Cypriot
deposits is to be sure a watershed moment, but for now not one we expect to
spark significant deposit withdrawals elsewhere. Meanwhile, the most likely
outcome to the Italian impasse appears to be new elections in the autumn.
With seemingly little prospect of a material rise in yields on the safest assets,
we think the search for carry evident across the full gamut of asset markets
will see peripheral spreads narrow over time.

Ten-year JGB yields have rallied to within a few bps of their all-time low,
ahead of next week’s inaugural meeting for the new BoJ leadership. We do
indeed expect aggressive easing, with JGB purchases out to 30 years, but
think this will be trumped by profit taking in JGBs after the fiscal year end.

Our latest Inflation Expectations Survey (F. Diamond, K. Gupta) was out
yesterday. One interesting result is that almost 90% of respondents believe the
BoJ has less than a 50/50 shot of hitting its 2% inflation target in two years, a
reflection of the formidable challenge of sparking inflation expectations after
two decades of falling prices.

ambiguous rules, but the Court has used it as a basis for deviating from the Rules in some circumstances. !4° Indeed, in some
lower court cases, Rule 2 has proven outcome determinative. For example, in United States v. Broadus, the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia used Rule 2 as a basis for deviating from the time limits imposed by Rule 29(c) for
the defendant to seek a new trial. '4! Relying on Rule 2, the court determined that a seemingly plausible inference from a
criminal rule cannot command blind adherence if it would deprive an accused person ... of a just determination of his or her
cause. !4? Using Rule 2 to protect defendants’ legitimate interests seems entirely proper. But crime victims need the same
textual support to secure their legitimate interests.

Not only is Rule 2 important, directly including crime victims in the language is important as well. Courts are used to resolving
disputes between prosecutors and defendants, not considering the interests of crime victims. !*? That problem is, indeed, the
whole reason for the passage of the CVRA. As Senator Feinstein has explained, In case after case we found victims and their
families were ignored, cast aside, and treated as non-participants in a critical event in their lives. They were kept in the dark by
... judges focused on defendant's rights, and by a court system that simply did not have a place for them. !4+4 For all these
reasons, Rule 2 should be amended to make clear that the Rules must be construed to be fair not only to the parties, but also to
victims.

[*885] Rule 11(a)(3) - Victims’ Views on Nolo Contendere Pleas The Proposals:
I proposed requiring courts to consider a victim's view before accepting any nolo contendere plea as follows:

Nolo Contendere Plea. Before accepting a plea of nolo contendere, the court must consider the parties’ and victims’ views and
the public interest in the effective administration of justice. !4

The Advisory Committee proposed no change to the rule. 4°
Discussion:

It is unclear why the Advisory Committee declined to change Rule 11 to require courts to consider victims' views on nolo
pleas. The CVRA Subcommittee purported to catalog and briefly discuss all of my proposals that the subcommittee declined to
recommend to the full Committee. Inexplicably, my Rule 11(a)() proposal (along with my other Rule 11 proposals) was not

147

mentioned and, thus, there is nothing in the available records to indicate that the Advisory Committee considered it.

Possibly the reason the Advisory Committee did not recommend this change was simply oversight.

Perhaps the Advisory Committee was relying on its global rule on victims’ rights (Rule 60) which provides that the court
must permit a victim to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court concerning ... [a] plea ... involving
the crime. '48 But that rule deals solely with the subject of being heard. Once the court has heard the victim, the question

CAPITAL CHAPTER IV U.S. Legal Landscape

State governments continue to adjust recreational cannabis regulations in an effort to create favor-
able industry conditions and address health and public safety concerns. State-licensed recreational
cannabis businesses must comply with a host of requirements related to security (such as video sur-
veillance, alarm system requirements and owner/operator criminal background checks), product diver-
sion (particularly seed-to-sale tracking requirements), product safety and quality (including product
labeling requirements and potency and contaminant testing), and general business operations (such as
restrictions on advertising and compliance with energy and environmental standards).

m U.S. Federal Law

Current federal law effectively prohibits all cannabis use and all commercial cannabis activity in the
United States. Producing, selling and possessing cannabis are federal crimes. No cannabis-derived drug
has ever been federally approved for use in treating any medical condition. Otherwise legitimate busi-
ness transactions conducted by cannabis companies—and their banks, for those who can access bank-
ing services—are legally suspect. Certain intellectual property and bankruptcy protections critical to
many U.S. businesses are not available to cannabis companies. Cannabis companies pay federal income
tax at effective rates significantly higher than other businesses.

Despite official prohibition, federal policies and laws recently passed by the U.S. Congress have
carved out a limited space in which the state-legal cannabis industry has managed to thrive. Enforce-
ment policies published by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) have unofficially invited cannabis
business to proceed if certain conditions are respected. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (DOT)
established reporting policies that create room for banks to service the cannabis industry. Federal bud-
get legislation has prevented allocated funds from being used to prosecute conduct that complies with
state medical cannabis laws.

Recent developments indicate that the federal government may be pursuing policies and practices
that create space for cannabis research and approval of cannabis-derived drugs. In particular, the US.
Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) adopted a new policy in 2016 designed to increase the number of
DEA-registered cannabis cultivators (there has been only one such cultivator for nearly 50 years). And
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is reviewing a New Drug Application (NDA) submit-
ted in October 2017 for what could be the first ever cannabis-derived pharmaceutical approved by the
federal government.

The following chart shows three general areas of federal law that impact the cannabis indus-
try—food and drug regulation, banking and finance, and intellectual property—as well as specific
laws and federal policies related to each of the areas discussed later in this chapter.

the outcome may have been different. But they were not
known to us at the time.

A prosecution decision must be based on admissible
facts known at the time. In cases of this type, those are
unusually difficult because victims are frightened and
often decline to testify or if they do speak, they give con-
tradictory statements. Our judgment in this case, based
on the evidence known at the time, was that it was better
to have a billionaire serve time in jail, register as a sex
offender, and pay his victims restitution than risk a trial
with a reduced likelihood of success. I supported that
judgment then, and based on the state law as it then stood
and the evidence known at the time, I would support that
judgment again.

Epstein’s treatment, while in state custody, likewise
may encourage the view that the office should have been
tougher. Although the terms of confinement in a state
prison are a matter appropriately left to the State of Flor-
ida, and not federal authorities, without doubt, the treat-
ment that he received while in state custody undermined
the purpose of a jail sentence.

Some may also believe that the prosecution should
have been tougher in retaliation for the defense’s tactics.
The defense, arguably, often failed to negotiate in good
faith. They would obtain concessions as part of a negotia-
tion and agree to proceed, only to change their minds,
and appeal the office’s position to Washington. The inves-
tigations into the family lives of individual prosecutors
were, in my opinion, uncalled for, as were the accusations

of bias and/or misconduct against individual prosecutors.

world Jewry. Such a resolution is supported by four facts: All
attempts to establish two states have ended in failure; the Jewish and
Palestinian populations are too intertwined to separate except forcibly
which would constitute apartheid; the physical geography and natural
resources such as water and natural gas in coastal waters make
division a source of perpetual tension; it is imperative to eliminate the
current legitimacy given to Israel's racist colonial system and to
establish a just political culture for all.

The resolution's implementation would be the responsibility of the
UN and Israel/Palestine, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. To
succeed, representatives of world powers may have to serve as even-
handed observers.

The international focus on the Goldstone Report elaborating Israel's
alleged crimes in Gaza, and on its assault on the humanitarian aid
flotilla uncover only the tip of the iceberg of Israel's violations of
international law. The UN is within its rights to sanction Israel for its
defiance of international laws and norms. However, although Israel is
the primary offender, Lebanon (denying Palestinians minimum
civilian rights), Jordan (withdrawing citizenship without due process
of the law), and the PA (an autocratic police- state), should all be
held accountable for gross human rights violations against the
Palestinians.

While a new course should be set based on reconciliation and
forgiveness, Israeli and Arab individuals charged with such war
crimes and human rights violations must be prosecuted. The General
Assembly should, therefore, establish an International Criminal
Tribunal as a subsidiary organ under Article 22 of the UN Charter
for this very purpose.

The proposed shift in the paradigms regarding the Palestinian/Israeli
conflict, once implemented will contribute to three UN goals: peace
and security of the West Asian/North African region as the new state

Re: Subpoena to Custodian of Records.
‘Dear Mr. Lefcourt:
, < I write in response to your letter of July 18, 2007 regarding the grand jury subpoena issued
SF to the Custodian of Records for NES, LLC. Ihave attached an identical subpoena containing aretum’

date of September 11, 2007, and subpoenas for two NES employees, Eric Gany and Harry Beller.
if you will not be representing Messrs. Gany and Beller, please let me know.

First, as [mentioned in my earlier correspondence, a properly executed declaration from the
Custodian of Records is needed, and, ifno documents responsive to a particular request exist, the
Custodian should certify that under penalty of perjury.

Second, you write that NES has no documents responsive to Requests 1 through 5. I know fg
that NES has several credit card accounts for the benefit of the persons who manage Mr. Epstcin’s Dy
properties, inchiding Janusz Banasiak and Alfredo Rodriguez. I also know that NES regularly ee
receives money from an account that is used to pay expenses at 358 El Brillo Way and also wires
money to that same account. Those. wire transfers fall within the time period called for by the
subpoena and number in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. If NES does not maintain records of
its banking activities, then I would like to see a copy of its document retention policy, so I have
added that to the Attachment to the Subpoena. ;

Third, Mt. Menchel’s comment to you about potential money laundering charges related only
to aresolution of the case. In other words, if the sex offense case is resolved, the Office would close
its investigation into other areas as well. The matter has not been, and it does not appear that it will
be, resolved so the money laundering investigation continues, and Request Number 6 will not be
withdrawn. The request is not overbroad and is stated with particularity, so please comply with the fo
’ request by the new deadline. owe F

tion software and a link to a twelve-minute video on encryption
(which might have been the same video he used at his CryptoParty
a few weeks earlier).

Greenwald did not manage to encrypt his computer, however,
and Snowden, unwilling to deal with Greenwald through an unen-
crypted channel, broke off contact with him in January 2013. Even
so, he did not give up his plan of using Greenwald in his enterprise.
He merely sought an intermediary who used encryption.

He chose Laura Poitras. He knew she and Greenwald were found-
ing board members of the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Green-
wald had written about her extensively. For example, he wrote an
entire blog about her confrontation with the U.S. government and
her plans to make a documentary about the “US Government’s
increasing powers of domestic surveillance [through] its expanding
covert domestic NSA activities.”

Since 2011, Poitras had been diligently filming the construction
of a massive NSA repository for data in Bluffdale, Utah. In the anti-
surveillance culture, the structure had become symbolic of the pow-

© ers of the NSA. In fact, it was the same NSA site that Parker Higgins ©
photographed from a blimp in the fall of 2013 and posted on the
Internet after Poitras had released her documentary about the NSA‘s
use of the Bluffdale repository for domestic spying.

Aside from her connections with Greenwald, Poitras had other
impressive credentials. Born in 1964 in Boston, she came from a
wealthy family that donated large sums of money to philanthropic
causes, including $20 million for research on bipolar disorders. After
graduating from the New School for Public Engagement in 1996,
she pursued a career as an activist filmmaker. Her focus quickly
became exposing NSA surveillance. One of her short documentaries
about the NSA’s domestic surveillance program was featured on the
New York Times website and attracted enormous attention in 2012.
As a dedicated opponent of the surveillance state, she participated
in public events with William Binney, the ex-NSA whistle-blower,
and Jacob Appelbaum. In April 2012, for example, she made a pre-
sentation at the Whitney Museum in New York with Binney and
Appelbaum. She had become such a leading activist against the NSA
by December 2012 that Appelbaum, after lauding her work, inter-

issues raised by our proposals and showing a willingness to find common ground
would we have any hope of success. No recess, Clinton said. He needed a straight
answer. Again, not full acceptance necessarily, but agreement to treat the proposals
as a basis for negotiating an Israeli-Palestinian peace. Arafat’s answer came shortly
before dawn. It was “no”.

Clinton couldn’t quite believe it. He went back to see Arafat, telling him he was
making an error on the scale of 1948, when the Palestinians had rejected the
partition of Palestine and the creation of an Arab state; or in 1978, when by
negotiating on the basis of Sadat’s Palestinian-rights framework, they would have
ended up with a mere 5,000 Israeli settlers on the West Bank instead of nearly
200,000. What most astonished Clinton was that Arafat was saying no even to
using the package as a basis for negotiations. Still, Arafat would not budge.

As Palestinian negotiators tried to salvage things by suggesting another trip by
Madeleine and Dennis to the Middle East, it was clear that even the Americans
were fed up. They knew that one side, at least, had been trying to get an agreement.
They couldn’t understand why Arafat was unwilling even to accept the “pocket”
proposals as a basis for further talks. When Yossi Ginossar, our most reliable
conduit, went to see Arafat, he found him sitting alone and, in Yossi’s description,
“paralyzed.” Clinton finally decided to have one last go. When he did, Arafat not
only remained unwilling. To the President’s astonishment, he insisted that the
ancient Jewish temple hadn’t been in Jerusalem at all, but in the West Bank city of
Nablus.

I was getting a bite to eat in the dining room in Laurel Lodge when Madeleine
showed up. She didn’t bother defending Arafat. She was as frustrated as I was. Her
message was that after the summit, it was important not to make things worse. A
negotiating process had to be kept alive. Then, Clinton sat down with me. He
delivered a similar message, but with even greater feeling. “You’re smarter than I
am,” he joked. “You’re certainly experienced in war, and I’m not. But I’m more
experienced in politics, and there are a few things I’ve learned along the way. The
most important is not to corner your adversaries, and not to corner yourself.
Always leave yourself a way out. Don’t lock yourself into a losing option.” I could
see that he was right. I also believed, as strongly now as before the summit, that
Israel’s own interests and its security were not served by an unresolved conflict
with the Palestinians. The problem was that, in the absence of an equal
commitment on Arafat’s side, any continued negotiating process seemed futile.

Science, Religion, and a Revived
Religious Humanism

For over 150 years there has been
a vital, and often contentious, dialogue
between science and religion. In recent

3 The lead author is Don Browning, Ph.D., the
Alexander Campbell Professor of Religious
Ethics and the Social Sciences, Emeritus,
Divinity School, University of Chicago. He has
interests in the relation of the social sciences to
religious ethics for the purpose of addressing
various challenges facing modern life. His books
include Generative Man (1973, 1975; National
Book Award Finalist, 1974), Religious Thought
and the Modern Psychologies (1987, 2004), the
co-authored From Culture Wars to Common
Ground: Religion and the American Family
Debate (1997, 2000), Christian Ethics and the
Moral Psychologies (2006), and Equality and the
Family (2007). He co-edited Sex, Marriage, and
Family in the World Religions (2006), American
Religions and the Family (2006), Children and
Childhood in American Religions (2009), and
Children and Childhood in World Religions
(2009). He is the co-principal investigator with
Jean Bethke Elshtain of a Templeton Foundation
funded $4,000,000 New Science of Virtue
project.

In this essay, Browning acknowledges
the antagonistic relationship that can be found
between science and religion, but he proposes
that the dialogue between science and religion
can now be conducted on philosophical grounds
that promote a new religious humanism that will
honor the core ideas of the great religions, refine
their view of nature, and increase the values of
health, wealth, education, and general well-
being.

years, new energy and fresh public
interest have been injected into this
conversation. This largely has come
about due to the new insights into
religion and ethics achieved by
collaboration between evolutionary
psychology and cognitive and social
neuroscience.

What are the likely social
consequences of this new interest in the
relation of science and religion? There
are at least three possible answers. One
might be the new atheism exemplified
by the writings of Richard Dawkins,
Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris, and
Christopher Hitchens. In this approach,
the alleged defective thinking of the
world religions is exposed, and a
worldview and way of life based strictly
on science are offered as replacement. A
second option might be the return of a
hegemonic dominance of religion over
science. However, polarizing rhetoric
from advocates for the exclusive
interpretive priority of either science or
religion has long since ceased to be
culturally or academically productive.
Instead, through dialogue about common
issues, scientific and theological thinkers
may pose questions that lead to more
sophisticated inquiry in both fields.

Confidence in the productive
possibilities of reciprocal questioning is
a hallmark of the long tradition known
as religious humanism. Here I illustrate
the potential contribution of religious
humanism by bringing recent
psychological research into dialogue
with the religious concept of love.

What would this religious
humanism be like? The major world
religions would remain visible and
viable as religious movements. But the
contributions of science would help
these religions refine their interests in
improving the health, education, wealth,

they got quickly pushed aside and Washington barely paid them further

DP: That aid dates back to the utterly different circumstances of the

Neat indeed. 
I'm writing about the Iran deal. So far have only sent a form paragraph in response to requests. Below. 
Noam 
On Iran, as usual, I'm a gloomy contrarian. I'm glad the treaty was signed, and it's kind of fun to watch the 
Republican lunatics shrieking hysterically as they try to kill it (as they may). And Israeli hypocrisy has gone 
well beyond being comical. But in fact the whole thing is farcical, in my opinon. In the US, Iran is the 
greatest threat to world peace, intoned constantly from on high, in the media, everywhere. There is also such 
a thing as world opinion, as measured by such ultra-radicals as Gallup. It turns out that the greatest threat to 
world peace is the US, by a very wide margin, no one else even close, and Iran barely mentioned. The 
American population is protected from these unwanted facts by the Free Press: not reported. There is an 
organization called US intelligence. They brief Congress regularly on the international security situation, all 
quite public. On Iran, they point out that it has very limited military power, even by regional standards (a 
small fraction of Saudi Arabia, for example). Its strategic doctrine is defensive. If— a big If— it has plans for 
nuclear weapons, that would be part of its deterrent strategy. Now who would be opposed to Iran having a 
deterrent strategy? Answer is clear: the rogue states that rampage violently in the region and don't want any 
impediment: the US and Israel, also lesser ones like UK and France. One simple way to reduce the threat of 
nuclear weapons would be to establish a nuclear-weapons free zone in the region, as has been done elsewhere 
(over US objections). That's been advocated by the Arab states for 20 years, with very wide global support, 
including Iran. It comes up regularly at the 5-year review meetings of the Nonproliferation Treaty, at the UN, 
again a few months ago, when, again, it was blocked by the US to protect its Israeli client, which has a huge 
nuclear weapons arsenal and wants to keep it. Again, the population is protected from such facts by the Free 
Press (though in this case there are some fringe exceptions, and of course the Arms Control literature). Same 
with the rest of the litany. Reading the US and UK press is like living in some lunatic asylum. I'm wondering 
whether to write about it — again; have done so repeatedly. It's like talking to a wall. Iran has an awful 
government, though by the standards of such US allies as Saudi Arabia, it's practically heaven. 
Nevertheless, better to have the treaty than not to, given the nature of the asylum.

development of sexual selection theory, one might have argued that perfect spheres
are some kind of Platonic solid, and inherently desirable, or that curvy hips yield
golden ratios. But with our current understanding of sexual selection, we recognize
that our sense of beauty has evolved and that there is no platonic sense of beauty
outside of that shaped by sexual selection. Any argument about perfect spheres is
unparsimonious and likely flawed. Without the help of evolution and game theory,
did philosophers conjure the moral equivalents of perfect spheres and golden ratios?
The state of nature, the orderly designer, Platonic ideals, autonomy, and humanity,
etc.—perhaps these arguments are also unfounded and unnecessary.

Washington must also keep in mind that Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei
has the last word on all matters in Iran, and that negotiations will go only
as far as he allows them to go. In years past, he issued a fatwa condemning
nuclear weapons -- Washington could take advantage of this fact by
drafting a UN Security Council resolution endorsing the fatwa. This could
be a small step toward boosting Khamenet's international profile while
simultaneously pressuring Iran to follow its own religious decree.

To be sure, regime change remains an attractive alternative on paper, and
some in Washington view it as an insurance policy. Historically, however,
regime change has not been a successful option for the United States, and
internal attempts at toppling Iran's leadership have thus far been crushed
by Stalinesque suppression, including the 2009 uprising. Despite such
failures and Washington's limited influence in Iranian domestic affairs,
U.S. policy should be to demonstratively support popular democratic
movements.

Yale, this confrontational approach was generally admired. It had not been acceptable to the
Rabbis, nor would it be to justices and judges.

Even at Yale, my chutzpah was not welcome by all the professors. Professor Fritz Kessler, was
an older European trained academic who taught jurisprudence. One day, he was lecturing on
Freud’s influence on German jurisprudence and he misunderstood one of Freud’s most important
theories. I raised my hand and corrected him. After class, an older student, who had been a
Marine and was married to another student in our class, grabbed me and said, “You embarrassed
someone I love. If you ever do that again, I’ll deck you.” I was startled and replied, “How did I
embarrass your wife?” He said, “Not my wife, stupid. Professor Kessler, you embarrassed him.
Don’t ever correct him again publicly.” So much for academic freedom. But Professor Bickel
was wise to caution me about toning down my aggressiveness if I wanted to succeed as a law
clerk.

Guido Calabresi offered similar cautionary advice, but it was more about style than substance. He
really pushed hard to get Justice Black to select me.

Professor Rodel was so concerned that I might contaminate the elderly Justice Black that he took
the train to Washington to try to persuade him to reject the recommendation of his recent law
clerk. In the end, Justice Black told Professor Calabresi that he had to defer to his friend's veto
for that year but that he would consider me for the following year. This was the best possible
news because it allowed me to accept a clerkship with Judge David Bazelon on the United States
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

Judge Bazelon was actually my first choice, but I also wanted--indeed I felt I needed--the status
that came along with a Supreme Court clerkship in order to obtain the kind of job offers I would
be seeking after finishing my clerkships. Two of my other mentors at law school, Professor
Joseph Goldstein and Professor Abraham Goldstein (not related) had both clerked for Judge
Bazelon. One of my primary interests in law school was the relationship between law and
psychiatry. Another was criminal law. Those were also Judge Bazelon's specialties. Making the
Bazelon clerkship even more appealing was the likely upcoming vacancy that would be left when
Justice Frankfurter, who had suffered a stroke, retired. Bazelon was on the short list to fill the so-
called Jewish seat on the Supreme Court. So if Judge Bazelon were to be promoted to the
Supreme Court, he might take his law clerk with him.

In the end, Judge Bazelon was regarded as too liberal for the Kennedy Administration and was
passed over for labor secretary Arthur Goldberg, who had no judicial experience, but boasted a
distinguished career as a labor lawyer before he joined the Cabinet as Secretary of Labor.
Bazelon and Goldberg were close friends, both having grown up in the Jewish neighborhoods of
Chicago and being the same age. I ended up clerking for both Judge Bazelon and for Justice
Goldberg, which was a dream come true. I spent two years in Washington from the summer of
1962 to the summer of 1964. These were extremely eventful years, not only for me, but for the
country and the world. The Cuban Missile Crisis took place several months into my clerkship
with Judge Bazelon. Martin Luther King's I have a dream speech was delivered in the summer
of 1963. And in the fall of 1963, early in my Supreme Court clerkship, President Kennedy was

‘Maybe Bill wanted to know if Epstein knew anything that could embarrass him. Or did Bill commute
Prosperi’s sentence as some kind of favour for Epstein?’ Virginia disclosed that Mr Clinton’s vice-
president Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, were also guests of Epstein on his island.

Guests: Virginia says she also met former Vice President Al Gore, pictured right with Mr Clinton

Last summer, the Gores abruptly announced that they were ending their supposedly fairytale marriage
and, just weeks later, it emerged that Mr Gore — the famously sanctimonious global-warming disciple —
had been accused of trying to force sex on a woman with whom he had booked a therapeutic massage
at an Oregon hotel. ‘I had no clue that anything was up,’ Virginia says. ‘The Gores seemed like a
beautiful couple when | met them. All | knew was that Mr Gore was a friend of Jeffrey’s and Ghislaine’s.
Jeffrey didn’t ask me to give him a massage. ‘There might have been a couple of other girls there on
that trip but | could never have imagined this guy would do anything wrong. | was planning to vote for
him when | turned 18. | thought he was awesome. ’Virginia said that yet another American liberal icon,
President Obama’s Middle East peace envoy Senator George Mitchell, frequently visited Epstein’s New
York residence. Mr Mitchell, aged 77 — who previously led America’s Northern Ireland peace initiative —
‘was very close to Jeffrey,’ Virginia recalled. ‘He is very clean-cut. You wouldn’t think of him being part of

Jeffrey’s crew.’

2.2 Finding the MRS in fitness

The evolutionary theory of time preference is complicated by the possibility that the returns from
an investment may increase the Darwinian fitness of the investor’s daughter (or other relative)
rather than that of the investor herself. This makes it necessary to use the evolutionary theory of
“kin selection,” which deals with interactions between relatives [9, 10].

The particular model used here was developed in another context [14], and its application to the
economic problem of time preference is discussed elsewhere [15]. Rather than repeat that material
here, I shall simply state the relevant results.

2.2.1 Results from the evolutionary theory of kin selection

The theory supposes that one individual (the donor or investor) undertakes an investment that has
an immediate effect on himself, but a delayed effect on a second individual (the recipient). The
donor and recipient may or may not be the same individual. The donor undertakes his action at age
z) and the recipient is affected after 7 time units, when the recipient’s age is a), This interaction
changes from P to P©) + AP the donor’s probability of surviving from age x to x + de.
The donor’s fertility during this same interval is changed from m™ to m® + Am™. Similarly,
the interaction changes from P®) to P®?) + AP©) the recipient’s probability of surviving from age
2) toc) +. da. The recipient’s fertility during this interval is changed from m®) tom +Am®),

The effect of this interaction on Darwinian fitness are summarized in table 1, which is adapted
from table 1 of [14]. Unlike the table used in my earlier work on time preference [15], this one
includes effects on fertility as well as on mortality. In the table, r denotes the coefficient of rela-
tionship between donor and recipient,” the subscripts D and R indicate the sex of the donor and of

*Wright’s coefficient of relationship [5, pp. 69, 137-138] can be interpreted as the fraction of their genes that two
individuals can expect to hold in common. It equals 1 if the donor and recipient are the same individual, 1/2 if the
recipient is an offspring, 1/4 if a grandchild, and so forth.

Iln 2009, Barack Obama had an

Palestinians had a prime minister who was 
respected and admired by the Israelis, 
because he did not come from the same

Views on Israel of U.S. Presidential Candidates 2020:  
Joe Biden  
Former Vice President Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr., was born 
November 20, 1942, in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the first of four 
siblings. In 1953, the Biden family moved from Pennsylvania to 
Claymont, Delaware. He graduated from the University of Delaware 
and Syracuse Law School. 
One of his first overseas visits as a senator was to Israel, on the eve 
of the 1973 Yom Kippur War during which he met GoIda Meir. She 
read letters and told me how this young man or woman had died and 
this is their family. This went on for I don't know how long, and I guess 
she could tell I was visibly moved by this, and I was getting depressed 
about it. The Prime Minister said, Senator, don't look so sad... .we 
have a secret weapon in our confrontation in this part of the world. 
And I thought she was about to lean over and tell me about a new 
system or something... .she said, our secret weapon, Senator, is we

are delirious with parenthood. I segway over to Amy Adams who mentions she also hates leaving her baby in
the hotel room. I tell her she’s acted like a lady with all the attention showered on Melissa Leo and
that someday soon she will win an Oscar because she consistently hands in amazing performances and
everybody loves her. Next stop is Kate Capshaw in a black bowler hat chatting with Steven Spielberg’s

Eisenberg I was on his plane home from the Baftas last week. He was hiding under his hoodie and I knew
not to bother him. He said innocently, “You should have said ‘Hello’. I always cover my head because I
think my curls make me look like a girl”.

The charity gives us a coupon booklet redeemable at various booths for cheap clothing, new iPads, make-
up, chocolates, shampoo and a $50 dollar Arch gift card for free McDonalds hamburgers. A bargain is a
bargain, rich people run around like lunatics, collecting gifts for their housekeepers. Among the
shoppers are Steven and Heather Mnuchin, Viacom’s Deborah and Philippe Dauman, Tamara Mellon, Christine
Taylor and Ben Stiller, Cate Blanchette, Susan and Robert Downey,Jr., and Debra and Hugh Jackman.

Next stop is The Weinstein Company’s Pre-Oscar party at the Soho House, sponsored by MontBlanc,
celebrating their new charity partnership and $1 million dollar donation to the Princess Grace
Foundation-USA. Long gone are the funky Miramax Saturday night parties where nominees spoofed their own
films in homemade costumes and ad-libbed hilarious skits. Grown men would dress as Anna Paquin and play
the piano in hopes of winning a Max Award.

There is social anxiety at the Soho House garage entrance. Guests patiently wait as super stars whisk by.
A four hundred pound gorilla refuses to let me on the elevator until I spot Benny Medina. Once on, I see
the radiant Jennifer Lopez in the corner and remind her we met on Len Blavatnik’s yacht in Cannes. She
graciously pretends to know me. Her manager, Benny Medina is kicking me.

I slip into Colin Firth’s booth by the front bar to have a tete-a-tete with him and his wife Livia
Giuggioli about tomorrow night. Jokingly, I suggest when he wins to say, “I’m speechless”. Colin
patiently assures me many people, far more clever than I, have already mentioned this. He then says that
others are waging bets on whether he might subconsciously stutter. I grill him about his wardrobe,
assuming he will be wearing a new Tom Ford tuxedo. He tells me both he and Ford will be in older models
as Ford only designs classics. I tell him I made director Charles Ferguson, front runner for the
financial documentary “Inside Job” spend $6,000 dollars last week for a new Tom Ford tuxedo.

In the back room Jennifer Lopez is now seated with wWeinstein’s wife Georgina Chapman. Nominee Helena
Bonham Carter, her husband Tim Burton and her mother Elena circulate. Celebs have now drifted over from
The Night Before Party. The star power includes Adrien Brody, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Cameron Diaz,
camilla Belle, Chace Crawford, Claire Danes and Hugh Dancy, Darren Aronofsky, Emma Stone, Jaime Foxx,
director John wells, Kerry Washington, Piers Morgan, Rachel Zoe, Russell Simmons, Sean Parker, Sir Ben
Kingsly, Zack Braff , Michelle williams and Leonardo Dicaprio with Bar Rafaeli. “Speech” filmmakers are
functioning on high anxiety.

Producer Donna Gigliotti is my date to the awards. We are both so nervous we arrive at the Kodak Theater
at 3:00pm and nobody is there. We are driven around for an hour. when we arrive at the world’s most
famous red carpet, I guide Donna through the extreme right security check-in to make sure we mingle with
the nominees and get on camera. I teach her the red carpet hustle which is five steps forward, three
steps back and one inch behind a couture-clad nominee. We greet Bryan Lourd as Sandra Bullock is talking
to ABC-TV and a billion people see me wearing a black Marchesa gown. Five steps forward, three steps
back, we next meet Gwyneth Paltrow. As I hook up the back of her dress another billion people see us
correcting a fashion malfunction. Once again, five steps forward and three steps back. We are now posing
for the still cameras between Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban. Our handbags begin buzzing. Countless
friends are e-mailing us that they just saw us on television.

James Franco and Anne Hathaway are hip and energetic hosts. The film montages are always the best and the
set looks great. This is the year of no surprises. Sorkin, Seidler, Christian Bale, Melissa Leo, Natalie
Portman and Colin Firth are totally prepared to receive the gold. Tom Hooper’s win leads into Best

While there are many tracking programs out there for children and even teens, GTX Corp
introduced an innovative product aimed at adults suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and other

namely putting a tracking device in the footwear.

GTX Corp (OTCBB: GTXO.OB) business unit LOCIMOBILE, Inc. is launching a series of GPS

The new apps all have a GPS component and are designed to add the “where is” factor to
functionality. The Company launched on the Android market place Phone Tracking™ in case you
lose or misplace your phone. More than 70 million phones are reported lost or stolen in the US
each year, but while the loss of a phone may be annoying, the loss of personal and business data

gotten into more fights there, growing depressed and withdrawn
from her sister and parents. Helplessly, her parents watched her
spiral out of control. As they neared the end of their rope, they
sent her out of state. But after the move, Mary had fallen apart
completely. She used drugs, fell in with a bad crowd, ran away
from her relatives, and shacked up with a gang of drug dealers.

When the gang was busted by local police, the dealers blamed
Mary for snitching and put out the word that they wanted her
dead.

“We had to move her again,” Mary’s father explained. “We
finally got her into therapy — she’s still seeing the therapist. And
worst of all, she developed HPV. She’s already had to have a seri-
ous operation.”

Mary’s troubles didn't end there. On June 28, she was brought
in front of the grand jury. She hadn't been briefed by the state
attorney —she hadn't even met the prosecutors —and she had
no idea what she would be asked.

Almost immediately, she found that she was being treated
more like a criminal than like a witness or victim.

“The prosecutor produced a printout of our daughter's
Myspace page,” Mary's father recalls. “Mary was stunned. She
began to cry. The prosecutor accused her of all sort of things; it

was like she was working for Epstein.

“All this time, we knew that we were being watched. Creepy 4

guys. Private investigators from Miami. They would follow us, 4
scaring the hell out of my wife and Mary’s sister. My car was vane a

dalized. It was like living in hell.”

By this point, Epstein’s defense dream team included Jack 4

had excellent track records. Dershowitz and Lefcourt were tWO

argue the Court’s adjudication of Plaintiffs’
claims would interfere with the executive
branch’s discretion to designate state
sponsors of terror. See 28 U.S.C.
§ 1605(a)(7)(A) (isting statutes that give
Secretary of State authority to designate
countries as sponsors of terrorism). Fi-
nally, Defendants submit the purpose
of(a)(5) was “to eliminate a foreign state’s
immunity for traffic accidents and other
torts committed in the United States, for
which liability is imposed under domestic
tort law.” Amerada Hess, 488 U.S. at
439-40, 109 S.Ct. 6838; Burnett IT, 292
F.Supp.2d at 19 (stating “the legislative
history [of the FSIA] counsels that the
exception should be narrowly construed so
as not to encompass the farthest reaches
of common law’).

Plaintiffs respond that if Congress in-
tended (a)(5) and (a)(7) to be mutually
exclusive or intended that (a)(5) never ap-
ply in the terrorism context, Congress
would have said so. Indeed, Congress did
so very explicitly with respect to (a)(5) and
(a)(2) and between (a)(7) and (a)(2). See
§ 1605(a)(5) (explaining exception can only
be used in situations “not otherwise en-
compassed in paragraph (2)”);
§ 1605(a)@) Game). To further buttress
their argument, Plaintiffs note the two ex-
ceptions have been interpreted to encom-
pass different situations. Subsection (a)(7)
covers acts of terrorism committed abroad
by a state sponsor of terrorism, while sub-
section (a)(5) governs tortious acts, includ-
ing terrorism, performed in the United
States. See Flatow v. Islamic Republic of
Tran, 999 F.Supp. 1, 15 (D.D.C.1998) (find-
ing (a)(7) applied to conduct outside the
United States and stating “28 U.S.C.
§ 1605(a)(5) already provides jurisdiction
over state-sponsored terrorist acts in the
United States, ... the state sponsored ter-
rorism exception would be redundant if it
were held to apply only within the United
States”). Again, Plaintiffs argue that De-

349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES

fendants’ argument of exclusivity would
lead to absurd results, such that if a for-
eign sovereign not designated a state spon-
sor of terror was involved in a car accident
stemming from negligence it would not be
immune; but if it undertook a deliberate
act of violence it would enjoy immunity
from suit.

The Court understands Plaintiffs’ desire
to find a legal remedy for the horrible
wrongs committed on September 11, 2001.
If appropriate, however, these Defendants
are entitled to immunity from litigating
these gravely serious claims in this forum.
Congress made a policy decision that the
Executive branch, and not the courts, have
the authority to label a foreign nation a
terrorist. See 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(7)(A).
But when it drafted the state sponsor of
terror exception it did not include mutually
exclusive language that would preclude the
application of the torts exception here. It
did include such language with respect to
the commercial activities exception. See
28 USC. § 1605(a)(7) “A foreign state
shall not be immune from jurisdiction of
courts of the United States or of the States
in any case—not otherwise covered by
paragraph (2) above.”); see also 28 U.S.C.
§ 1605(a)(5) “A foreign state shall not be
immune from jurisdiction of courts of the
United States or of the States in any
case—not otherwise encompassed in para-
graph (2) above.”). Particularly in a case
such as this where interests of sovereignty,
comity, international relations, and separa-
tion of powers are implicated, the Court
must be vigilant to exercise discipline to
apply the law only as it is written. While
there are certainly obstacles to (a)(5)’s ap-
plication—and the Court is not convinced
the Plaintiffs have or can overcome
them—the Court will not rule as a matter
of law that subsections (a)(7) and (a)(5) are
mutually exclusive. Accordingly, the
Court will consider Plaintiffs’ evidence

Which Road Will Egypt Take?

Kathryn Alexeeff

May 19, 2014 -- With Abdul Fattah al-Sisi’s official resignation from the
military and bid for the presidency, the future of Egypt looks murky at
best. While his victory is highly likely, the question remains—down which
path will he take Egypt? Al-Sisi’s support for the anti-Morsi protesters
may indicate support for the democratization of Egypt and the will of the
people. On the other hand, his bid looks like a giant leap backwards for
Egypt, a return to a military dictatorship. Egypt has several potential paths
forward under an al-Sisi government, none of which are ideal.
Unfortunately, Egypt appears to be justifying analysts’ worst fears and
will likely return to a Mubarak-style military autocracy under al-Sisi.

The first option is a military government that enacts economic and
political reforms that improve the lives of the citizenry, not just the
military or the elites. This will lead to a slower evolution toward
democracy. On the plus side, slower evolution under a stable government
would allow structural changes to take root, fostering effective institutions
and greater stability. The negative side is that evolution of this sort would
be neither smooth nor straightforward. It would come in fits and spurts,
punctuated by returns to oppression and violence. It would also be
extremely slow, and easy for a demagogue to reverse. Unfortunately,
given Egypt’s current situation, option one is highly unlikely. Given the
high levels of repression and violence, the only reforms the government
will likely enact would involve greater centralized power in its hands.
Furthermore, there are a myriad of ways for a government to pay lip
service to democratization without actually decreasing its power. Another
option is that Egypt becomes stuck in a proverbial time loop—trepeating
the revolution every year or two when the government fails to deliver on

allowed my father to enroll at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.

He did well in his studies — literature, history and philosophy — but
abandoned them after two years. His explanation for not staying on, when I
asked him years later, was that with the accelerating activity of the Zionist
pioneers, it felt wrong to him to spend his days going to lectures, reading books
and writing essays. I am sure that he also felt isolated and alone, with Meir, the
only link to his life before Palestine, working in Haifa on the coast, four or five
hours by bus from Jerusalem. When he began looking for a way to become part
of the changes going on around him, Mishmar Hasharon didn’t yet exist. Its
founding core — a dozen Russian Jewish pioneers — was still working on
argicultural settlements near Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv, until they found a
place to start their kibbutz. But they had been joined by several young men and
women who, though a year or two older than my father, had been with him at
the Hebrew High School in Ponovezh. He decided to join them.

Late in 1932, the Jewish National Fund, supported financially by leading
Jewish figures in western Europe and the US, bought 2,000 acres from an Arab
landowner near Wadi Khawaret. The area was set aside for three Jewish
settlements: a moshav called Kfar Haim, where the land was divided into family
plots, and two kibbutzim. One was called Ma’abarot. Next to it was Mishmar
Hasharon. My father was among the seventy youngsters who set off in three
trucks with everything they figured they would need to turn the hard, scrubby
hill into a kibbutz. They built the core from pre-fab kits: wooden huts to sleep in
and a slightly larger one for the dining hall. They dug a well and ordered a
pump from Tel Aviv, at first for drinking and washing, but soon allowing them
to begin a vegetable garden, a dairy with a dozen cows, a chicken coop with a
few hundred hens, and to plant a first orange grove and a small vineyard.

Still, by the time my mother arrived three years later, there were not enough
citrus trees, vines, cattle and chickens to occupy a membership which now
numbered more than 200. Along with some of the others, my father worked
outside the kibbutz, earning a regular paycheck to help support the collective.
On his way back, he would stop at the post office in Tel Aviv to pick up letters
and packages for the rest of the kibbutz — including Ya’akov Margalit’s love
letters to my mother. That was how my parents’ friendship began, how a
friendly hello led to shared conversation at the end of my father’s working day,
and how, a few years later, my mother decided to spurn her Gordonia suitor in
favor of Srulik Brog, the postman. It was not until 1939 that they moved in

Navigating post-Trump volatility 
• We are recording unprecedented divergences in falling equity vol with rising rates vol post Trump's win. Intra-
day S&P realized vol collapsed from near 60% to below 20% in 2d [Chart 1] 
• While equities have shown less conviction over what a Trump win means (given strong sector rotation), the 
bond market has sold off with one of the largest moves in history [Chart 2 & 3] 
• Stabilizing rates volatility from here is key to markets remaining calm and while equity upside may continue, it is 
not without higher risks 
• We like cheap optionality to hedge long-equities if rates continue to move sharply 
For investors long equities, we look at ways to cheapen protecting from downside risks in the event of further bond

Court declines to adopt this standard.
There was no question that, at a minimum,
the defendants in these products liability
actions had substantial contacts with the
forum, in these cases being New York, and
were involved in the sale or production of
the products at issue. In re DES Cases,
789 F.Supp. at 559; Simon, 86 F.Supp.2d
at 99-100. Here, however, there are ques-
tions as to the Defendants’ contacts with
the forum, whether it be the United States
generally or New York specifically, and
the Defendants’ alleged involvement with
al Qaeda is much more attenuated.

B. Due Process Requirements

[46-49] Any exercise of personal juris-
diction must comport with the require-
ments of due process. “The due process
test for personal jurisdiction has two relat-
ed components: the ‘minimum contacts’
inquiry and the ‘reasonableness’ inquiry.”
Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Robertson—Ceco
Corp., 84 F.3d 560, 567 (2d Cir.1996). De-
pending on the basis for personal jurisdic-
tion, due process under either the Fifth or
Fourteenth Amendment applies. “[TJhe
due process analysis is basically the same
under both the Fifth and Fourteenth
Amendments. The principal difference is
that under the Fifth Amendment the court
can consider the defendant’s contacts
throughout the United States, while under
the Fourteenth Amendment only the con-
tacts with the forum state may be consid-
ered.” Chew v. Dietrich, 143 F.3d 24, 28
n. 4 (2d Cir.1998). Here, personal jurisdic-
tion under the New York long-arm statute
requires minimum contacts with New York
pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment.
The exercise of personal jurisdiction under
Rule 4(k) requires contacts with the Unit-
ed States as a whole pursuant to the Fifth
Amendment.

1. Minimum Contacts

[50,51] Minimum contacts are re-
quired so “that the maintenance of the suit

349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES

does not offend traditional notions of fair
play and substantial justice.” Intl Shoe
Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316, 66
S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945); see also
World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Wood-
son, 444 U.S. 286, 292, 100 S.Ct. 559, 62
L.Ed.2d 490 (1980). The minimum con-
tacts requirement is also known as “fair
warning,” such that the defendant’s con-
tacts with the forum should be sufficient
to make it reasonable to be haled into
court there. Burger King, 471 U.S. at
474, 105 S.Ct. 2174. The “ ‘fair warning’
requirement is satisfied if the defendant
has ‘purposefully directed’ his activities at
the residents of the forum ... and the
litigation results from alleged injuries that
‘arise out of or relate to’ those activities.”
Id. (internal citations omitted); see also
World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U.S. at 297-
98, 100 S.Ct. 559 (finding purposefully di-
rected activities where defendant delivered
products into stream of commerce with ex-
pectation they would be purchased by resi-
dents of forum); Calder, 465 U.S. at 789-
90, 104 S.Ct. 1482 (finding publishing ac-
tivities outside of forum were calculated to
cause injury to plaintiff in forum where
she lived and which also had the highest
subscription rate). “Although it has been
argued that foreseeability of causing wu-
ry in another State should be sufficient to
establish such contacts there when policy
considerations so require, the Court has
consistently held that this kind of foresee-
ability is not a ‘sufficient benchmark’ for
exercising personal jurisdiction.” Burger
King, 471 US. at 474, 105 S.Ct. 2174
(quoting World-Wide Volkswagen, 444
U.S. at 295, 100 S.Ct. 559). In every case,
there must be “some act by which the
defendant purposefully avails itself of the
privilege of conducting activities within the
forum State, thus invoking the benefits
and protections of its laws.” Jd. (quoting

elsewhere.

During the 1890s and the early years of the new century, more than a million
Jews fled Eastern Europe, but mostly for America. It was only in the 1920s and
1930s that significant numbers arrived in Palestine. Then, within a few years,
Hitler rose to power in Germany. The Jews of Europe faced not just
discrimination or pogroms. They were systematically, industrially, murdered.
From 1939 until early 1942 when I was born, nearly two million Jews were
killed. Six million would die by the end of the war. Almost the whole world,
including the United States, rejected pleas to provide a haven for those who
might have been saved. Even after Hitler was defeated, the British shut the
doors of Palestine to those who had somehow survived.

I was three when the Holocaust ended, and it was three years later that Israel
was established in May 1948, and neighboring Arab states sent in their armies
to try to snuff the state out in its infancy. It would, again, be some years before I
fully realized that this first Arab-Israeli war was the start of an essential tension
in my country’s life, and my own: between the Jewish ethical ideals at the core
of Zionism and the reality of our having to fight, and sometimes even kill, in
order to secure, establish and safeguard our state. Yet even as a small child, I
was keenly aware of the historic events swirling around me.

Mishmar Hasharon, the hamlet north of Tel Aviv where I spent the first 17
years of my life, was one of the early kibbutzim. These collective farming
settlements had their roots in Herzl’s view that an avant-garde of “pioneers”
would need to settle a homeland that was still economically undeveloped, and
where even farming was difficult. Members of Jewish youth groups from
Eastern Europe, among them my mother, provided most of the pioneers,
drawing inspiration not just from Zionism but by the still untainted collectivist
ideals represented by the triumph of Communism over the czars in Russia.

It is hard for people who didn’t live through that time to understand the
mindset of the kibbutzniks. They had higher aspirations than simply planting the
seeds of a future state. They wanted to be part of transforming what it meant to
be a Jew. The act of first taming, and then farming, the soil of Palestine was not

himself in trials He was arrested for obscene performances only because there were no blasphemy
laws. I went to the bank and deposited my check, withdrawing half of it in cash, a $500 bill.
Lenny was alone in his hotel room on Christmas Day when I presented it to him. And, with a
large safety pin, Lenny attached the $500 bill to the outside breast pocket of his denim dungaree

jacket.
AFTER JFK ASSASSINATION

In another column of mine, “Jack Ruby and His Dirty Little Secret,” it began, “Lenny Bruce
told me how all the night club comics used to Jack Ruby’s “tattoo of a lady’s schmutzik (translate:
pussy) in his armpit.” If it wasn’t a fact, I was quite willing to settle for an apocryphal allusion
which nevertheless crystallized the entire personality of that alleged murderer who wanted so

very much to be liked.

I say alleged because upon Ruby’s own death. Dallas District Attorney Henry Wade said he
would dismiss the murder charge against him, a promise which has since been kept, although no
such posthumous grace was ever officially bestowed on Lee Harvey Oswald. See, they grant you
retroactive innocence only in the face of innumerable witnesses who were present at the actual

event through the miracle of inadvertent televised coverage.
Now Jack Ruby’s dirty little secret has been forever sealed away in his armpit by the hymen of
history. Oh yeah, and at Lenny’s funeral, that safety pin was still attached on his jacket.

JULES SIEGEL

Two years before Lenny’s death, with his permission I published his obituary in my own
magazine, 7he Realist. Before the issue went to press, he called his mother and a few others to
let them know it would only be a hoax. The point was that he couldn't get work and his work was

his life so he might as well be dead. And if people regretted that they hadn't helped him, well,

Dear Ghislaine
Thank you for your good-humoured patience with us and the legal team today, during what is, understandably, a testing time.

To confirm:

1) I spoke to Dilenschneider in NYC at length tonight and shared strategy and role definition.

2) we sent agreed statement to Dan Mangan ay NYPost - he's on deadline for a piece on Charlie Sheen/Rob Lowe and seems to
have moved on - for the moment.

3) we will release statement via Press Association and PR Newswire @11.00GMT tmrw and follow up with calls to those
journalists who have written pieces.

We will create call log/matrix and advise feedback and sentiment as appropriate tmrw. Please don't hesitate to call if you have
any additional concerns.

Best regards
Ross

including masturbation and touching the girl’s vagina.

Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Jane Doe
was recruited to give Epstein a massage for monetary com-
pensation. Jane was brought to Epstein’s mansion in Palm
Beach. Once at the mansion, Jane was introduced to Sarah
Kellen, who led her up the flight of stairs to the room with the
massage table. In this room, Epstein told Jane to take off her
clothes and give him a massage. Jane kept her panties and
bra on and complied with Epstein’s instructions. Epstein
wore only a towel around his waste [sic]. After a short period
of time, Epstein removed the towel and rolled over exposing
his penis. Epstein began to masturbate and he sexually
assaulted Jane.

- After Epstein had completed the assault, Jane was then
able to get dressed, leave the room and go back down the
stairs. Jane was paid $200 by Epstein. The young girl who
recruited Jane was paid $100 by Epstein for bringing Jane to
him.

As a result of this encounter with Epstein, Jane experi-
enced confusion, shame, humiliation and embarrassment, and

has suffered severe psychological and emotional injuries.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012824.txt,"Cho’s case 1s not the exception, but the rule: persistent fantasies, whether sexual, violent, or
sexually violent, are often played out in real life. When people voice their fantasies, we should open our
ears. When therapists, especially those influenced by the catharsis view of the mind, encourage their
patients to engage in aggressive fantasies to release their pent up energy, we should bring forward
malpractice suits as they are accomplices to crime.

What kind of mind is most likely to rev up the fantasy world to supersonic levels and then
unleash it in the service of excessive harm? Lust murderers — individuals with a craving for the bizarre and
degenerate —provide one answer to this question. Lust murderers are typically repeat offenders or serial
killers. The serial nature of their crimes comes from the fact that they are motivated by recurrent
fantasies that create recurrent cravings. They are, effectively, addicted to violence. Their fantasies often
entail some kind of paraphilia — an extreme and abnormal sexual arousal to objects, people or situations
— played out through some form of sadism — a persistent pattern of sexual or non-sexual pleasure from
humiliating, punishing and harming others. Here again we see the promiscuous human mind at work,
seamlessly blending pleasure and violence, animate and inanimate attractions, sometimes with benign
origins, but often with malignant outcomes. Thus, the pleasure derived from humiliation may develop out
of the more common, normal and less harmful pleasure we experience from mockery and humor.
Humiliation is just a small step away in a mind that derives joy from others’ demise.

The paraphilias, like many of the other disorders that appear within the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Health, fall along a continuum from rather benign forms of voyeurism to
erotophonophilia, the vicious and sadistic killing of an mnocent victim in order to achieve ultimate sexual
satisfaction. Regardless of the particular object or situation driving the paraphilia, individuals become
addicted. Like other addictions, including those associated with food, drugs, and alcohol, paraphilic
addicts experience withdrawal. Dangerously for the world around them, the erotophonophilic or lust killer
harbors sadistic paraphilias, including flagellation — the need to club, whip or beat someone —
anthropophagy — the desire to eat human body parts — picquerism— a craving to stab someone or cut
off their flesh, focusing especially on genitals and breasts — and necrosadism — a yearning to have
sexual contact with the dead. Although these desires may seem unimaginable, they reveal one facet of the
human mind’s potential — a potential that was fully realized in the mind of Jeffrey Dahmer who
flagellated, cannibalized, dismembered, and engaged in necrophilia with his 17 victims. Such disordered
minds are part of the human condition, one that stretches from individuals who never cache in on their
fantasies to those who not only deliver, but develop — as in addictions to food and drugs —— deeper and

deeper desires for harming others without the rewards that come from such harm. When wanting and

~EDITORIAL OBSERVER-
An invigorated second term

From The New York Times:

Early Wednesday moming, as sleep-deprived supporters rallied for a final
cheer, President Barack Obama concluded his re-election campaign with a
promising glimpse at what the fight was all about: a second-term agenda that
can make real progress on issues neglected in the first.

Without question, the president intends to build on and improve the stgnifi-
cant accomplishments of the last four years, particularly the full implementa-
tion of health care reform and the use of government policy to keep the econ-
omy growing. But the president went beyond that in his victory speech and
added some less familiar words to his policy vocabulary.

Children should live in a world that is not burdened by debt or weakened by
inequality, he said, but also one “‘that isn’t threatened by the destructive power ofa
warming planet.” That suggests he knows he has an opportunity to address cli-
mate change with more vigor, going beyond auto-mileage standards and renew-
able-energy jobs to possibly advocating tougher carbon emissions standards,

The presidentalso said he was looking forward to working with Republicans
to fix the immigration system, giving him a chance to do more than promote
the DREAM Act for young immigrants. He could lead the way to comprehen-
sive reform that combines strong enforcement with a path to citizenship for
immigrants already here. He also hinted that combating poverty might move
higher on his priority list.

And he spoke of tax reform, an issue that will immediately begin to grow
louder with the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts at year’s end. Obama won
re-election on an unambiguous promise not to renew those cuts for incomes of
$250,000 or more, and his supporters expect him to stick to that vow. In com-
ing months, after he persuades Congress to keep taxes fromrising on the mid-
dle class, he should push to restore a fair estate tax and raise the low capital
gains rate to the level of ordinary income.

He even mentioned the need to fix a balloting system that left thousands of
people standing in long lines to vote this week, a tantalizing hint that electoral
reform might become a priority.

All these agenda items require the same ingredient: ending his standoffish
attitude toward Congress and working closely with any leader or lawmaker
willing to make real progress. That may be easier now that Senate Democrats
(and their independent allies) have expanded their majority by two seats to 55,
many of them filled with newcomers more liberal and feisty than their prede-
cessors, most notably Elizabéth Warren of Massachusetts.

The new Democratic caucus’ first order of business should be a reform of
the filibuster that prevents its routine abuse by Republicans, and the majority
leader, Harry Reid, suggested Wednesday that he supported some modest
changes. The newcomers, along with the nme House, should forcefully
advocate that he go as far as possible:

Anewly energized Obama administration an Senate could have the effect of
isolating the supply-side dead-enders in the House. John Boehner, the House
speaker, announced Wednesday that nothing had changed; he and his caucus
still oppose higher tax rates for the rich and still want to pursue Romney’s
defeated goal of raising revenue by lowering rates and cutting unspecified loop-
holes. Standing up to Republican recalcitrance on this and many other issues
will require bringing to bear political pressure from the coalition that gave
Obama a commanding victory in the Electoral College on Tuesday.

The president’s victory was decisive, and many who didn’t support him
nonetheless told pollsters that they agreed with his positions on taxes, health
care and immigration. He now needs to use the power that voters have given
to him to enhance and broaden his agenda.

U.S. politics changes for the better

America has changed.

There are periods when we grow as
a society m degrees. Then there are
times when we take great leaps for-
ward. If you examine the history of
our country back to the days of the
first Spanish, English and French
immigrants, you will see certain
moments when our national dynamic
shifted.

This week, we saw a moment when
the America that has been growing and
changing by degrees met with a
moment when Anterica made a hard
tum on its path.

For years we have seen the brown-
ing of America. For years we have seen
the tolerance and acceptance level of
different religions, economic condi-
tions, sexual orientations, political
beliefs and ancestries grow in mea-
sured steps through the increase in one-
onl-one interactions and social media.

For years we have seenthe steady
progress of women, and felt a subtle
shift in the rhythm of America.

This week, we saw several of these
trends converge in a moment when it
became evident that once again,
America has changed.

The demographics of the exit polls
tell an interesting story. President
Obantia’s support came overwhelming-
ly from groups of people who are often
described as disenfranchised:

* Those who make less than $50,000

year,

« Those with some or no college
education;

¢ Women;

* Young people;

* People of color.

These groups, who in the past have
felt like their votes were taken for
granted, for the first time in a long time,
saw their votes carry weight that makes
them get noticed.

People more “wonky” than me will

be going over these numbers for
months to come. These numbers tell
me, though, that the reason why so
many people were surprised about the
outcome in this race ignored the num-
bers that had nothing to do with polls.
They want to say that it is because
these communities were voting to keep
their entitlements and “handouts,” but
that is just a denial of the real truth
What people want is to no longer
feel disenfranchised and marginalized
What people want is for their voices
to be included, not shouted down.
Recent data shows that women now
outnumber men by a slim margin.
More people live in cities. People of
color now make up almost a third of
the population. The average age is 37.
Almost two thirds of us own homes,
but there are more of us who have
either never been married or are
divorced than there are those of us who

- are married.

The fastest shrinking demographic
is white men.

So many of the people who fit the
demographics that elected President
Obama are those in demographics that
are seeing their numbers grow and also
are becoming more politically active
and savvy. They are truly looking to
connect with candidates who have their
concems in mind. These are not one-
issue voters.

They care about the economy but
they also care about their place in our
society. They want their social issues to
be a part of the discussion. Our nation-
al identity is more about mclusion than
assimilation. This is a vast switch from
where we have been.

Those ofus in groups that have been
considered on the fringe or in the
minority have found solidarity in our

RGB onie Pittspugen (ysT-GAZETTE

experiences in this country and are
increasingly deciding we are no longer
satisfied with trying to fit in and would
rather have a seat at the table as our
unique selves.

Women, the LGBT community and
Latinos made great strides with this
election. AfricanAmericans and young
people reminded the political parties of
the value of their support.

There is a lotof finger pointing from
the Republican tallang heads as to why
their candidate lost. It seems they are
slowly coming to realize it was not
only whom they ran as candidates but
also where those candidates stood on
issues that are important to this grow-
ing voting power block.

I was struck by how few people of
color were in the crowds for Mitt
Romney toward the end of the cam-
paign. It was like they no longer cared
about even the illusion of inclusion,
and instead decided to bank their future
on their main demographic. What their
campaign failed to take into consider-
ation is that the issues that matter most
to people right now stretch across racial
and gender lines.

Those of us usually considered on
the fringe are multifaceted and have
learned a very powerful lesson after
this election. When we band together
to get our issues on the agenda, we
force the conversation to change.

Hopefully, both parties have learned
that you don’t have to pander to us, but
you do have to listen to us because we
are not going away.

America has changed, and if history
is any indication that is a very good

B-

Let’s just hope we embrace the
change in the spint of cooperation and
not segregation.

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021288.txt,"For research purposes, loneliness
is typically measured on a continuum
that ranges from not at all lonely (.e.,
socially connected) to very lonely. It is
informative, however, to get a sense of
the prevalence of loneliness when
assessed as present or absent. Loneliness
is a common experience; as many as 80
percent of people under 18 years of age
and 30 percent of people over 65 years
of age report being lonely at least
sometimes. For most people, feelings of
loneliness are situational and transient
(e.g., geographic relocation). For as
many as 15-30% of the general
population, however, loneliness is a
chronic state, and it is among these
individuals that loneliness wreaks its
greatest havoc. In a study of children
followed through young adulthood,
those who were highly lonely at each of
three measurement occasions (i.¢.,
childhood, adolescence, and at 26 years
of age) exhibited a significantly greater
number of standard health risks. The
chronically lonely individuals were more
likely to have higher body mass index
(BMI), elevated blood pressure, higher
levels of total cholesterol, lower levels
of “good” HDL cholesterol, greater
concentrations of glycosylated
hemoglobin (an index of impaired
glucose metabolism), and poorer
respiratory fitness than those who were
lonely at only two or one of the
measurement occasions.” In a study of
older adults, loneliness predicted
mortality over a 3-year period, and
increased mortality was explained by the
fact that lonely individuals had more
chronic diseases and functional
limitations.’ Higher rates of mortality in
lonely individuals do not appear to be
attributable to inadequate healthcare
utilization: even after accounting for the
presence and severity of chronic illness,

Page |42

lonely individuals are actually more
likely than nonlonely individuals to
make use of health facilities and
physicians.*

Most chronic diseases (e.g.,
hypertension, coronary artery disease,
diabetes) are the result of the interactive
influences of genetic, environmental,
and behavioral factors on physiological
functioning. How do feelings of
loneliness penetrate to a level that affects
disease risk? Plausible pathways include
poor health behaviors, stress-related
processes, restorative “anti-stress”
processes, and even differences in
patterns of gene activity. In general,
physiological systems exhibit
redundancies and compensatory
processes that minimize the immediate
health effects of adverse heritable,
environmental, and behavioral factors.
However, subtle changes in these
predisease pathways can be detected
prior to the onset of manifest disease and
may indicate the beginnings of a steeper
downward trajectory in resilience.”

Take health behaviors, for
instance. Major risk factors for disease
in Western society include high-calorie,
high-fat diets, and sedentary lifestyles,
each of which contribute to being
overweight or obese. Feelings of
loneliness have been associated with
greater incidence of these predominantly
lifestyle risk factors. In a large cross-
sectional survey of adults 18 years and
older, the lonely group had a higher
mean BMI and a greater proportion of
overweight/obese individuals than did
the nonlonely group. Loneliness has
been associated with lower levels of
physical activity in every age group from
grade school to middle-age adults. In the
latter study, lonely individuals were also
more likely to become inactive over
time. Changes in health status also

—JULIAN ASSANGE, Newsweek, 2015

ULIAN ASSANGE had made a brilliant career of trafficking in

state, military, and corporate secrets. Born on July 3, 1971, in
Queensland, Australia, Assange began his hacking career while still
a teenager. Using the alias Mendax (“the untruthful one”), he had
hacked into the computers of the Pentagon, the U.S. Navy, NASA,
Citibank, Lockheed Martin, and Australia’s Overseas Telecommuni-
cations Commission before he was twenty. At the age of twenty-five,
he pleaded guilty to twenty-five charges of hacking in Australia but
was released on a good behavior bond. In 2006, with the spread of
Tor software, he co-founded WikiLeaks, a website in which secret
documents could be anonymously sent and posted. The site received
little public attention until Bradley Manning sent it several hun-
dred thousand lowly classified U.S. military and State Department
documents in April 2010. With these stolen documents, WikiLeaks
became a media sensation, and Assange, the runner-up for Time’s
Man of the Year for 2010, became a leading figure, along with Appel-
baum, in the global hacktivist underground.

marina sales have indicated that now is a good time to invest in a marina, despite the previous
recession and limited financing.

Competitive Marinas

The most significant supply and demand indicators for the subject are rental and occupancy rates
experienced by directly competing properties. The operation of a pleasure craft marina provides
revenue sources which include a mix of various rental, sales and services for the pleasure craft
operators. Principle revenue stream for pleasure craft marinas includes in-water slips, fuel sales, and
building rent.

The subject’s asking and average contract rates are shown in the table that follows. The current
operator is leasing the marina slips by linear feet of vessel length. We have then converted this rental
income into a rental rate per linear foot of dock space. The subject offers slip rental on a daily, weekly,
monthly, seasonal and annual basis. The contracted rental rates represent a blend of these rates, from
daily tenants to long term tenants on annual leases. According to management, approximately 60% of
the occupants at any given time are seasonal or annual tenants.

Average 105 54 2,063,127 1,240,968 60.1% $1,441,192 $35.35

We weren't provided with a current rent roll for the marina slips but we were provided with monthly
historical occupancy and rental rate data. With the transient nature of marina tenants, a historical
rent and occupancy figures are a more accurate indication of the income properties of the marina.
Rental rates at the subject, and in this market, are based ona rate per linear foot of vessel length. As
discussed earlier, the subject contains 105 wet slips with a total of 5,680 linear feet of rentable dock
space, which indicates a total of 2,073,200 rentable linear feet per year.

As of the effective valuation date, the subject marina has experienced an overall occupancy rate of
56.3% for the year to date 2015. We have looked at occupancy rates on an average, annual basis due
to the seasonal characteristics of this property type in this market. Again, due to the transient nature
of the tenants in this property type and the short term nature of the leases which can range from daily
to annually, the overall occupancy rate will be lower than other commercial property types such as
lodging, multifamily, retail and office. The subject’s current occupancy rate is slightly lower than
historical rates, but the property is considered to be at stabilized occupancy.

The weighted average contract rate is $37.29 per linear foot per month for the year to date 2015,
which equates to an average contract rate of $447.50 per linear foot per year.

parameters have for a very long time fallen within the range spanned by modern natural-fertility
populations. In my previous paper, I estimated using demographic statistics from a wide variety
of natural-fertility populations, and found that this variation had little effect on the answer. Con-
sequently, I will restrict attention here to a single set of demographic statistics. I use fertility and
paternity data of 19th century Utah [6] and the Model West life table with mortality level 12 [3,
p. 47]. This mortality level implies that the expectation of life at birth ef is approximately 45 years.

3.2 Results

Before presenting new results, I summarize some old ones. Figure 5 shows an evolutionary dis-
count function from my earlier paper on time preference. In the figure, “age at investment” refers
to the age at which a decision is made between an immediate and a delayed benefit. Ages beyond
the age at investment are “future ages.” Thus, the line marked by open circles shows the discount
function pertaining to some investment that might be undertaken by newborn infants, whereas the
line marked by stars pertains to investments by young adults.

To understand what these curves mean, consider a hypothetical 20-year old woman who has
been offered some survival benefit that will not arrive until she is 40. Since she is female and is
now of age 20, the starred curve in the upper panel of figure 5 applies. It indicates that the average
discount rates within the four 5-year intervals spanning ages 20-40 are 0.059, 0.050, 0.012, and
0.007 respectively. The average of these is 0.032, and this implies® that the future benefit should
be discounted by a factor of exp[—20 x 0.032] = 0.529. The 20-year old, therefore, should value
this delayed benefit at only about half of its nominal value. In general, one applies a MRTP that is
an average of \ over the relevant interval.

The figure illustrates the major conclusions of the previous analysis:

e In the long run, \ converges to a value of about 2%, very close to the value predicted by the
heuristic argument leading to equation 10. This lent support to my conclusion regarding the
interest rate.

e The curves for different ages of investment lie nearly atop one another. Thus, \ is well
approximated by a function of one argument: A(z, y) © A*(y).

e The evolutionary discount is much higher among young adults than among their elders. This
predicts higher marginal rates of time preference among young adults, a prediction with
which we can all identify.

However, figure 5 describes an analysis on survival axes rather than consumption axes. The
evolutionary discount function there refers, in other words, to a trade-off between the survival
(not the consumption) of donor and recipient. The methods introduced here allow an analysis on
consumption axes, with varying levels of importance accorded to marginal fertility and marginal
survival.

The average of predicts 9, the MRTP. This average is equal to 9 = 0.032, and equation 1 implies that the future
benefit is discounted by a factor of e~°T , where 7 = 20 is the time delay.

Glossary

As I said in the introduction, I try to keep my writing as accessible as possible. One way I
do that is by avoiding jargon and by using terms that I think most people will recognize. I
often write S&M instead of BDSM, for example; and when I'm using technical SM
language like top or bottom or scene, I try to define the words as I go along. But
sometimes I slip into jargon by accident. Also, plenty of S&M terms are super useful, and
giving a quick overview of S&M language can go a long way towards describing S&M
culture. Hence, this glossary. Many of the terms in the Glossary aren't terms that I used
in this book, but you might find it useful or interesting anyway. (I also included a few
terms that come from other subcultures, like polyamory or queer studies or feminism,
because why not.)

te ok ok

aftercare (BDSM): A cool-down period after an S&M encounter, which often involves
reassurance and a discussion of how things went. Aftercare is discussed a lot in this book,
especially in Aftercare or Brainwashing? (part 3).

CHAPTER NINETEEN
The Rise of the NSA

“There are many things we do in intelligence that, if revealed, would have the potential for all kinds of blowback,” --
National Intelligence” — James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence

In the Game of Nations, which is played at a level that often is not visible to public scrutiny,
the great prize is state secrets that reveal the hidden weaknesses of a nation’s potential
adversaries. The most important of these in peacetime is communication intercepts. It was just
such state secrets that Edward Snowden took from the NSA in the spring of 2013. Before that
breach, America’s paramount advantage in this subterranean competition was its undisputed
dominance in business of obtaining and deciphering the communications of other nations. The
NSA was the instrument by which the United States both protected its own secret
communications and stole the secrets of foreign nations. The NSA, however, has an Achilles’
heel: it is dependent on civilian computer technicians who do not necessarily share its values to
operate its complex system. Because of this dependence, it was not able in 2013, as it turned out,
to protect its crucial sources and methods.

Snowden exposed this vulnerability when he walked away with, among other documents, the
32,000 page-long country by country descriptions of the gaps in America’s coverage of the
communications of its adversaries. Even though the Cold War had been declared over after the
collapse of the Soviet Union a quarter of a century earlier, the age-old enterprise of espionage did
not end with it. Russian and China still sought to blunt the edge that the NSA gave the United
States. So the Snowden breach cannot be simply looked as an isolated event. It needs to
considered in the context of the once and future intelligence war.

The modern enterprise of reading the communications of other nations traces back in the
United States to military code-breaking efforts preceding America’s entry into the First World
War The invention of the radio at the end of the nineteenth century soon provided the means of
rapidly sending and getting messages from ships , submarines, ground forces, spies, and
embassies. These over-the-air messages could also be intercepted from the ether by adversaries.
If they were to remain secret, they could not be sent in plain text. They had to be sent in either
code, in which letters are substituted for one another, or, more effectively, cipher, in which
numbers are substituted for letters. Making and breaking codes and ciphers became a crucial
enterprise for nations. By 1914, the US Army and Navy had set up units, staffed by
mathematicians, linguists and crossword puzzle-solvers to intercept and decode enemy messages.
After the war had ended in 1918, these units were fused into a cover corporation called the “Code
Compilation Company,” which moved to new offices on 37 Street and Madison Avenue in New
York City. Under the supervision of the famous cryptographer Herbert O Yardley, a team of 20
code-breakers was employed in what was called the “Black Chamber.” Yardley arranged for

are needed in college into the hands of the high schools so that the
university professor’s life is easier and involves less teaching that he
doesn’t want to do.

So, of course, professors want high schools to do a better job. The
question is why high schools should care about what universities want
at all. High schools have their own problems, or should have, but they
have been convinced to ignore their problems and focus on the prob-
lems that universities have.

Parents demand that high schools prepare their kids for college,
which really means help them get into college. Gradually the high
school curriculum has become one giant entrance test for college. The
idea that someone might not want to go to college seems very odd to
most people. So, if the colleges say more math, then more math it is.
But colleges are not saying more math in good faith. They are just hav-
ing high schools teach what they don’t want to teach.

But there are about 3,000 colleges in the United States and only
about 50 top-tier research universities. What Yale needs may not be
what the other colleges need. Why, then, is the tail wagging the dog?
Yale says jump and everybody asks how high. Yale sets the rules. Yale
says 3 years of math, and 3 years of math it is, even though higher
math will not, or at least should not, come up in most college classes.

Does Yale know it is doing this? Do the faculty understand that
by requiring that the high schools teach mathematics, they are caus-
ing massive numbers of dropouts and making learning a very stressful
experience for most high school students?

I think the answer is no, but even if they did know it, they would
do nothing about it. They have a university to run and they simply
cannot change the way they operate. I can explain this with a story,
this time from Columbia University.

I once had the opportunity to create courses for Columbia Uni-
versity that would be put online through a business I started that
was funded (and then abruptly terminated when the dot com boom
busted) by venture capitalists. I interviewed various professors at Co-
lumbia in order to decide which courses to put online. I wasn’t trying
to simply copy the courses they had but was trying to build learn-by-
doing versions of them that would be more engaging than the usual
lecture course and would try to teach real-world skills rather than the
usual stuff one gets in an introductory course.

We decided to build an economics course and talked at length with
the chairman of the Economics Department. We decided to simulate

           The Best of Paul Krassner  

          Introduction by Andy Borowitz

What They Say About the Author


     	“Paul’s own writing, in particular, seemed daring and adventurous to me; it took big chances and made important arguments in relentlessly funny ways. I felt, down deep, that maybe I had some of that in me, too; that maybe I could be using my skills to better express my beliefs. The Realist was the inspiration that kept pushing me to the next level; there was no way I could continue reading it and remain the same.”
 --George Carlin

     “Paul Krassner--confidant of Lenny Bruce, co-founder of the Yippies, defiler of Disney characters, publisher of The Realist, and investigative satirist extraordinaire. As soon as we decided to create the Huffington Post, I knew I wanted him involved. His irreverence was just what the blog doctor ordered.”
 --Arianna Huffington

     “Thanks to Paul Krassner for continuing to be the lobster claw in the tuna casserole of modern America.”
--Tom Robbins

     “Krassner loves ironies, especially stinging ironies that nettle public figures. He would rather savor a piquant irony about a public figure than eat a bowl of fresh strawberries and ice cream.”
--Ken Kesey

     “I told Krassner one time that his writings made me hopeful. He found this an odd compliment to offer a satirist. I explained that he made supposedly serious matters seem ridiculous, and that this inspired many of his readers to decide for themselves what was ridiculous and what was not. Knowing that there were people doing that, better late than never, made me optimistic.”
--Kurt Vonnegut

     “Mr. Krassner is an expert at ferreting out hypocrisy and absurdism from the more solemn crannies of American culture.”
--The New York Times

     “Krassner has the uncanny ability to alter your perceptions permanently.”

                                        --The Los Angeles Times

     “He has lived on the edge so long, he gets his mailed delivered there.”

                                   --San Francisco Chronicle

“Krassner lives in a world where Truth and Satire are swingers, changing partners so often you never know who belongs with whom.”

--Playboy

     “Perhaps the satire magazine that most closely resembles Charlie Hebdo in terms of inflammatory imagery was The Realist, created by Paul Krassner…”
                                                           --Time

     “Paul taught me that extreme stylistic accuracy could make even the most bizarre comedic concept credible. He is a unique character on the American landscape. A self-described ‘investigative satirist,’ he straddles the lines between politics, culture, pornography and drugs -- in other words, the land where all of us, were we really honest with ourselves, would choose to dwell.”
	--Harry Shearer

     “I have been a fan of his since I was a snot-nosed kid, and his words have been a driving force and influence on my life. If you have read his work before, you know the joys that you are in for. If you haven’t, start reading, and consider this your lucky day. For Paul Krassner is an activist, a philosopher, a lunatic and a saint, but most of all he is funny.”

                                             --Lewis Black


Many of the pieces in this collection originally appeared in The Realist, High Times, AVN, N.Y. Press, National Lampoon, The Nation, L.A. Times, Whole Earth Review, Huffington Post, Alternet, CounterPunch, and Truthdig. Several pieces have not been published before, but only for this collection.
     For George Carlin, who continues to serve as a satirical touchstone 


                         *   *   *


          “Hypocrisy is better than having no values at all.”
   --William Bennett, former education czar, 	   	   drug czar, morality czar and gambling czar

“MTV actually told us, ‘You can make fun of God because he doesn’t 
exist, but you can’t make fun of Jesus because he’s God’s son.’”

    --Vernon Chatman & John Lee,

About the Author
Paul Krassner published The Realist (1958-2001), but when People magazine labeled him “father of the underground press, he immediately demanded a paternity test. And when Life magazine published a favorable article about him, the FBI sent a poison-pen letter to the editor calling Krassner “a raving, unconfined nut.” George Carlin responded, “The FBI was right. This man is dangerous—and funny; and necessary.” While abortion was illegal, Krassner ran an underground referral service, and as an antiwar activist, he became a co-founder of the Yippies (Youth International Party). Krassner's one-person show won an award from the L.A. Weekly. He received an ACLU (Upton Sinclair) Award for dedication to freedom of expression. At the Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam, he was inducted into the Counterculture Hall of Fame — “my ambition,” he claims, “since I was three years old.” He’s won awards from Playboy, the Feminist Party Media Workshop, and in 2010 the Oakland branch of the writers organization PEN honored him with their Lifetime Achievement Award. “I’m very happy to receive this award,” he concluded in his acceptance speech, “and even happier that it wasn’t posthumous.--paulkrassner.com

                    THE EARLY YEARS











From Carnegie Hall to MAD Magazine


     I first woke up at the age of six.
     It began with an itch in my leg. My left leg. But somehow I knew I wasn't supposed to scratch it. Although my eyes were closed, I was standing up. In fact, I was standing on a huge stage. And I was playing the violin. I was in the middle of playing the “Vivaldi Concerto in A Minor.” I was wearing a Little Lord Fauntleroy suit–ruffled white silk shirt with puffy sleeves, black velvet short pants with ivory buttons and matching vest–white socks and black patent-leather shoes. My hair was platinum blond and wavy. On this particular Saturday evening–January 14, 1939–I was in the process of becoming the youngest concert artist in any field ever to perform at Carnegie Hall. But all I knew was that I was being taunted by an itch. An itch that had become my adversary.
I was tempted to stop playing the violin, just for a second, and scratch my leg with the bow, yet I was vaguely aware that this would not be appropriate. I had been well trained. I was a true professional. But that itch kept getting fiercer and fiercer. Then, suddenly, an impulse surfaced from my hidden laboratory of alternative possibilities, and I surrendered to it. Balancing on my left foot, I scratched my left leg with my right foot, without missing a note of the “Vivaldi Concerto.”
Between the impulse and the surrender, there was a choice–-I had decided to balance on one foot–and it was that simple act of choosing which triggered the precise moment of my awakening to the mystery of consciousness. This is me! The relief of scratching my leg was overshadowed by a surge of energy throughout my body. I was being engulfed by some kind of spiritual orgasm. By a wave of born-again ecstasy with no ideological context. No doctrine to explain the shock of my own existence. No dogma to function as a metaphor for the mystery. Instead, I woke up to the sound of laughter.
I had heard that sound before, sweet and comforting, but never like this. Now I could hear a whole symphony of delight and reassurance, like clarinets and guitars harmonizing with saxophones and drums. It was the audience laughing. I opened my eyes. There were rows upon rows of people sitting out there in the dark, and they were all laughing together.
They had understood my plight. It was easier for them to identify with the urge to scratch than with a little freak playing the violin. And I could identify with them identifying with me. I knew that laughter felt good, and I was pleased that it made the audience feel good–but I hadn't intended to make them laugh. I was merely trying to solve a personal dilemma. So the lesson I woke up to–this totally nonverbal, internal buzz–would serve as my lifetime filter for perceiving reality and its rules. If you could somehow translate that buzz into words, it would spell out: One person's logic is another person's humor.
I finished playing “Vivaldi” by rote. Then I bowed to the audience and walked off stage. The applause continued, and I was pushed back on stage by my violin teacher, to play an encore, “Orientale.” I had previously asked him–while rehearsing the encore–why it wasn't listed on the program since we already knew that I would play it at the concert. But instead of answering my question, he poked me in the chest, verbalizing each poke: “Violin up! Violin up!” Now, while playing “Orientale,” I heard the echo of his voice, and I automatically raised my violin higher.
Then I popped my ears and the music sounded clearer. I wondered if it sounded clearer to the audience too. They had no idea that their laughter had woken me up. I was overwhelmed by the notion that everybody in the audience had their own individual This-is-me, but maybe some of them were still asleep and didn't know it. How could you tell who was awake and who was asleep? After all, I hadn't known that I was asleep, and look what I accomplished before I woke up. If it hadn't been for that itch, I might still be asleep.
There was, of course, an objective, scientific explanation for what happened on the stage of Carnegie Hall. According to a textbook, Physiological Psychology, “It is now rather well accepted that 'itch' is a variant of the pain experience and employs the same sensory mechanisms.” But for me, something beyond an ordinary itch had occurred that night. 
It was as though I had been zapped by the god of Absurdity. I didn't even know there was such a concept as absurdity. I simply experienced an overpowering awareness of something when the audience applauded me for doing what I had learned while I was asleep. But it was only when they laughed that we had really connected, and I imprinted on that sound. I wanted to hear it again. I was hooked. And the first laugh was free.
A couple of decades later, as if it was inevitable, I sold a few freelance pieces to Mad magazine. But when I suggested a satire on the pros and cons of unions, the editor wasn't interested in even seeing it because the subject was “too adult.” Since Mad's circulation had already gone over the million mark, publisher Bill Gaines intended to keep aiming the magazine at teenagers.
“I guess you don't wanna change horses in midstream,” I said.
“Not when the horse has a rocket up its ass,” Gaines replied.
And that moment served as the conception of an irreverent magazine for grown-ups, The Realist . . .





    A Child’s Primer on Telethons

    See the tired man. He has been up all night. He is running a telethon. He wants the people to send money. It is for leukemia. That is a disease. Little children like you can catch it. Evil.
    See the sexy girl. She is a singer. She doesn't know whether the telethon is for leukemia or dystrophy or gonorrhea. Her agent got her the booking. She needs the exposure. Notice her cleavage.
    See the handsome man. He does know that it's for leukemia. You can tell. He is singing a calypso melody. Listen to the lyrics. “Give-your-money,” he sings, “to-leukemia. Give-your-money, to-leukemia.” Listen to the audience applaud. He is very talented.
    See the sincere politician. He is running for reelection in November. He is against leukemia. He is willing to take an oath against it. That proves he is against it.
    See the wealthy businessman. He is making a donation. He wants his company's name mentioned. Then we can buy his product. Then he will make profits. Then he can make another donation next year. Splendid.
    See the little boy. He has leukemia. Too bad for him. The nice lady is holding him up to the TV camera. Aren't you glad it's not you? But wouldn't you like to be on television? Maybe you can fall down a well.
    See the pretty scoreboard. It tells how much money they get. They want a million dollars. Uncle Sam has many millions of dollars. He cuts medical research funds by more than seven million dollars. Why? He needs the money for more important things.
    See the mushroom cloud. That costs lots of money. It has loads of particles. They cause leukemia. Money might help to find a cure. That is why we have telethons.
See the tired man . . .


Sex Education For the Modern Catholic Child

This is a diaphragm. Women use it when they don’t want to have a baby. That is very immoral. Why, you ask? Because it is artificial, that’s why. But never fear. There are other methods to prevent conception. They are very moral. Why, you ask? Because they are natural, that’s why.
This is big brother’s pajama bottoms. He had a nocturnal emission last night. What a shame. It woke him up. But see the semen stain. It has millions of dead sperms. They were killed the natural way.
This is his sister’s sanitary napkin. It doesn’t look very sanitary any more, does it? There is an ovum somewhere in that bloody mess. But it will never be fertilized. It will be flushed down the toilet bowl. That’s the natural way, too.
This is a baby. It was born dead. Every day in the U.S.A., 136,000 infants are stillborn or die within a month. Now suppose their Mommies and Daddies had interfered artificially with the process of procreation. God’s purpose would never have been achieved. Just think what a tragedy that would’ve been. But at least some of the dead babies were baptized. That’s the natural way.
This is a special calendar. It marks off menstrual periods. That’s for the rhythm system of not having babies. A husband and his wife are in bed. They start to make love. Then they get out of bed. Because they have to look at the calendar. That’s the natural way.
This is a husband and wife who don’t want to have a baby yet. But the calendar says that the time is fertile. So they stop making love. Because one thing would lead to another. Ask [advice columnist] Dorothy Dix. She should know. She tried it once with [advice columnist] Dr. Crane. Just to prove her theory. Later she had to write to his Worry Clinic. She was worried because she missed her period. She missed it very much.
This is a husband and wife who do want to have a baby. But the calendar says that the time is sterile. Lucky for them they have a calendar. It saves them from having unnecessary intercourse. Unless they like to gamble on having unwanted babies. That’s the natural way.
This is a confessional booth. There is a screen in the middle. The person on one side is a priest. The person on the other side is a confessor. He is confessing that he has had evil thoughts. The priest tells him that to have an evil thought is evil. It is just as evil as committing the evil act that the evil thought is about. Priests never have evil thoughts themselves. They don’t have to. They have an ample supply of other people’s evil thoughts to draw upon.
This is the husband and his wife again. The ones who don’t want to have a baby yet. Now the calendar says that the time is sterile. How convenient. Now they can make love without stopping. And without worrying. But they’re good, consistent Catholics. And so they are worrying. Because they know that evil thoughts are evil. Their evil thought is to have intercourse but to avoid having a baby. They can’t be sure they won’t have a baby--that’s why the rhythm system is moral--but the intention is there. Tomorrow they will go to confession.
Postscript:
I wrote the above piece in 1958 (before the Pill), and it turned out to be theologically correct in 1984, when Pope John Paul II warned that the rhythm method of birth control can be “an abuse if the couple is seeking in this way to avoid children for unworthy reasons.”





A Child’s Primer on Fighting Communism

Now we are going to have some fun fighting Communism. Let us play a game of Make Believe. Close your eyes and concentrate. We are going to pretend that Red China doesn’t exist. They are the Bad Guys. Because they make people slaves.
Nationalist China is different. They are the Good Guys. There, hundreds of thousands of little unwanted children are sold. They work in coal mines. Then they are wanted. The older girls work in brothels. How nice to be so wanted. Open your eyes now. Anyone around our base is it.
Fidel Castro says Cuba is a socialist state. That proves they are Communists. But we knew it before. You could tell by the way Castro and Khrushchev hugged each other. So we stopped buying sugar from Cuba. Now other countries buy sugar from Cuba.
Iran has bought 10,000 tons of sugar from Cuba. Iran gets a lot of economic and military aid from us. So we are helping Cuba anyway. Maybe we should trade tractors for prisoners then. But we will fool them. We will put treads on all the old Edsels that didn’t sell.
There are Communists in the United States too. They are dangerous. So the Supreme Court says they have to register as foreign agents. Otherwise they have to go to jail. So they register as foreign agents. Then they have to go to jail under the Smith Act.
So the Communist Party isn’t very much fun to belong to any more. But there’s a way to belong without going to jail. You have to join the FBI first. Most of the members do it that way. J. Edgar Hoover is the head of the Communist Party.
Why are Communists such a threat to us? Because they advocate the violent overthrow of the government. That is why Governor Rockefeller wrote his name on the bottom of a new law. Now anyone who gets convicted in Federal Court for advocating the violent overthrow of the government will lose his driver’s license.
That law was passed in April 1961. But on the 4th of July holiday the United States broke all previous traffic accident records. More people got killed in cars than ever before. The roads are still full of dangerous Communist spies.
How can we defeat Communism all over the world? By foreign aid. That turns Neutral Guys into Good Guys. Meanwhile there is a great big famine in Red China. So Canada will ship wheat to them. But special machinery is needed for this. It is made in America. And the U.S. Justice Department doesn’t allow such sales. Because Bad Guys deserve to starve. Everybody knows that. Especially the Neutral Guys.
So Canada shouldn’t be mad at us. Didn’t President Kennedy plant a tree there? That’s personal diplomacy. It has nothing to do with hungry human beings in Red China. The way to avoid feeling guilty about suffering people is just don’t recognize them.


A Child’s Primer on Divorce

Oh, look. Mommy and Daddy are having another fight. Is it just an attention-getting device this time? Listen. They are having an adult discussion. They are agreeing on a separation. That means you will come from a broken home. What a shame. Even if they fight all the time they should stay together for your sake. Now you will be insecure.
Mommy and Daddy are modern people. They drink Pepsi-Cola. They also have a modern marriage. They left the word “obey” out of their wedding ceremony. Wasn’t that modern? But they didn’t leave out the words “love” and “honor.” Mommy and Daddy are only modern, not avant-garde. They left “till death do us part” in the ceremony, too. But they are going to get a divorce anyway. They don’t have to obey their marriage vows. Lucky thing they left out that word.
What is to be done to keep Mommy and Daddy together? The Ladies’ Home Journal will help. They have a regular feature in their magazine. It is called “Can This Marriage Be Saved?” Readers send in Betty Crocker boxtops and try to guess the correct answer.
Maybe Mommy and Daddy will go on television. There is a program all about Divorce Court. Dr. Paul Popenoe is the master of ceremonies. He wears glasses. Sometimes while the commercial is on, the actors have reconciliation. It is a real fun show.
Mommy and Daddy live in New York State. To get a divorce there, one of them has to commit adultery. Daddy has a tryst with a girl. Mommy raids the joint. She brings along a photographer. Mommy has secretly been having an affair with the photographer. What Daddy doesn’t know won’t hurt him. He always wanted to be on Page 3 of the Daily News anyhow. Mommy made sure that his undershorts were ironed.
Benjamin Brenner lives in Brooklyn. He is a Supreme Court Justice there. He makes decisions. He decided that raiding the joint is illegal from now on. Unless you have a search warrant. Then it’s legal, but you have to knock first and say, “Benny sent me.” This new rule doesn’t count for hotel rooms. Then it’s okay to raid the joint. So Daddy better get his own apartment. Judge Brenner is really under the thumb of real-estate agents.
There is another way. Mommy can go to Reno. She lives there for six weeks. That is called “establishing residence.” Reno is Keno but Alabama is Clamor. Same-day service. The Chamber of Commerce invites lawyers to practice there. They are promised the run of the divorce mill. More people are traveling to Alabama than ever before. They are called Freedom Riders.
Here comes the governor of New York. See him eat the potato knish. He wants to get a divorce. He will establish residence in another state. But then he can’t be governor. Instead he will get a divorce in New York. But you know what that means. Dirty, dirty. Some deserving Young Republican girl will get the assignment. This is known as political patronage. The governor has a horny dilemma, though. Either he commits scandal or he commits perjury. Maybe he will propose a new law.










RELIGION FOR DUMMIES

Pope Endorses Condoms

When I was a kid, condoms were called prophylactics, prophylactics were called rubbers, and rubbers were called scumbags. My friends and I would find used scumbags in a vacant lot or in the alley between buildings. Once, while snooping, I found a large package of unused prophylactics in my father’s sock drawer. It must have held a dozen. Now there were nine left. Each was tightly rolled, bound by a miniature cigar-like band. I selected one, took the band off, and carefully unrolled it.
There was a legend imprinted on the prophylactic: “Sold in Drug Stores Only For the Prevention of Disease.” What hypocrisy! They were sold for the prevention of pregnancy, which is a condition, not a disease. The irony is that now condoms don’t carry that message but they are used for the prevention of disease. Anyway, I tried to re-roll my father’s prophylactic and stuff it back into the band, but it was a losing battle, so I decided not to put it back in the package, figuring that my dad wasn’t counting his condoms and would never know.
As an adolescent, I found that purchasing condoms was a traumatic experience. I would buy other stuff to avoid being embarrassed. “I’d like a Batman comic book, and this Snickers candy bar, and [whispering] a pack of Trojans, and a tube of Crest toothpaste, please.” But four decades later there were huge billboards, warning: “If you can’t say no, use condoms.” However, an executive of the Gannett Outdoor Advertising Company confirmed that they held off putting up those signs until after a visit by the Pope.
Members of the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy have been faced with an interesting dilemma. On the one hand, they are opposed to condoms as an artificial method of birth control. On the other hand, they are aware that condoms can serve as a protection against AIDS. But a group of bishops issued a statement that educational programs which include information about condoms should also stress that they are morally incorrect.
     That’s sort of like in the Watergate scandal when Richard Nixon said, “We could get the million dollars—but that would be wrong.”
Coincidentally, in November 2010, while the porn industry in California was being pressured to require all male actors to wear condoms to prevent AIDS, in the Vatican it was revealed that, for the exact same reason, Pope Benedict--in his official capacity as the Church’s chief spin doctor--went on record proclaiming that under some circumstances it might be acceptable for a (male) prostitute to use a condom.
“There can be single justified cases,” he rationalized, “for example, when a prostitute uses a condom, and this can be a first step toward a moralization, a first act of responsibility in developing anew an awareness of the fact that not everything is permissible and that we cannot do everything we want. However, this is not the best way to overcome the infection of HIV. It is really necessary to humanize sexuality.”
Daniel Maguire, author of Sacred Rights: The Case for Contraception and Abortion in World Religions, observed that the pope’s change in policy represents a significant “crack in the dike” of Catholic opposition to condom use. The opposition stems from Catholic dogma that sex is for reproduction, and nothing should interfere with that.
     An issue of The Realist reprinted an article from the London Observer, which began: “Three Roman Catholic theologians have expressed the opinion that, in times of revolution and violence, it is lawful for women, particularly for nuns, to take contraceptive pills and precautions against the danger of becoming pregnant through rape.”
     On that same page was our Rumor of the Month: “So-called ‘flying saucers’ are actually diaphragms being dropped by nuns on their way to Heaven.”

I Ran an Underground Abortion Referral Service

     When abortion was illegal, women had no choice but to seek out back-alley butchers for what should have been a medical procedure in a sterile environment. If there was a botched surgery and the victim went to a hospital, the police were called and they wouldn’t allow the doctor to provide a painkiller until the patient gave them the information they sought.
     In 1962, there was an article in Look magazine that stated, “There is no such thing as a 'good' abortionist. All of them are in business strictly for money.” But in an issue of The Realist, I published an anonymous interview with Dr. Robert Spencer, a truly humane abortionist, promising that I would go to prison sooner than reveal his identity.
     He had served as an Army doctor in World War I, then became a pathologist at a hospital in Ashland, Pennsylvania. He went down into the shafts after a mine accident, and aided miners to obtain Workmen’s Compensation for lung disease. At a time when 5,000 women were killed each year by criminal abortionists who charged as much as $1500, his reputation had spread by word-of-mouth, and he was known as “The Saint.” Patients came to his clinic in Ashland from around the country. 
     I took the five-hour bus trip from New York to Ashland with my gigantic Webcor tape recorder. Dr. Spencer was the cheerful personification of an old-fashioned physician. He wore a red beret and used folksy expressions like “by golly.” He had been performing abortions for 40 years. He started out charging $5, and never more than $100. He rarely used the word pregnant. Rather, he would say, “She was that way, and she came to me for help.” 
Ashland was a small town, and Dr. Spencer's work was not merely tolerated; the community depended on it–-the hotel, the restaurant, the dress shop–-all thrived on the extra business that came from his out-of-town patients. However, he built facilities at his clinic for African-American patients who weren't allowed to obtain overnight lodgings elsewhere. The walls of his office were decorated with those little wooden signs that tourists like to buy. A sign on the ceiling over his operating table said Keep Calm.
Here’s an excerpt from our dialogue:
     Q. Do you have any idea about how many actual abortions you’re performed during all these years?
     A. To be accurate, it’s 27,006
     Q. Have medical people come to you, who would otherwise shun you?
     A. Oh, yes, I’ve had medical people who bring me their wives, and I’ve had quite a few medical people send me patients.
     Q. But they wouldn’t perform the operation themselves?
     A. No, they’d never perform it, and just exactly what their attitude would be, I don’t really know. Some of them, I presume, were absolutely against it, because I’ve had ministers, and they’d bring me their daughters or their nieces.
     Q. Have police come to you for professional services?
     A. Oh, yes, I’ve had police in here, too. I’ve helped them out. I’ve helped a hell of a lot police out. I’ve helped a lot of FBI men out. They would be here, and they had me a little bit scared--I didn’t know whether they were just in to get me or not.
     Q. What would you say is the most significant lesson you’ve learned in all your years as a practicing abortionist?
     A. You’ve got to be careful. That’s the most important thing. And you’ve got to be cocksure that everything’s removed. And even the uterus speaks to you and tells you. I could be blind. You see, this is an operation no eye sees. You go by the sense of feel and touch. The voice of the uterus. But the only thing I can see is hypocrisy, hypocrisy. Everywhere I look is hypocrisy, Because the politicians--and I’ve had politicians in here--they still keep those laws in existence, but yet, if some friend of theirs is in trouble… 
     Even priests came to his clinic with the housekeepers they had impregnated. As if to retroactively approve of such hypocrisy, the Colorado Independent reported in 2013 that “A chain of Catholic hospitals has beaten a malpractice lawsuit by saying that fetuses are not equivalent to human lives.” Their attorneys argued that in cases of wrongful death, the term “person” only applies to individuals born alive, and not those who die in utero.
     After the issue of The Realist featuring that interview with Dr. Spencer was published, I began to get phone calls from scared female voices. They were all in desperate search of a safe abortionist. It was preposterous that they should have to seek out the editor of a satirical magazine, but their quest so far had been futile, and they simply didn't know where else to turn.
     With Dr. Spencer's permission, I referred them to him. At first there were only a few calls each week, then several every day. I had never intended to become an underground abortion referral service, but it wasn't going to stop just because in the next issue of The Realist I would publish an interview with somebody else.
A few years later, state police raided Dr. Spencer's clinic and arrested him. He remained out of jail only by the grace of political pressure from those he'd helped. He was finally forced to retire from his practice, but I continued mine, referring callers to other physicians that he had recommended. Occasionally I would be offered money by a patient, but I never accepted it. And whenever a doctor offered me a kickback, I refused, but I also insisted that he give a discount for the same amount to those patients referred by me.
Eventually, I was subpoenaed by district attorneys in two cities to appear before grand juries investigating criminal charges against abortionists. On both occasions I refused to testify, and each time the D.A. tried to frighten me into cooperating with the threat of arrest.
In Liberty, New York, my name had been extorted from a patient by threatening her with arrest. The D.A. told me that the doctor had confessed everything and they got it all on tape. He gave me until two o'clock that afternoon to change my mind about testifying, or else the police would come to take me away.
     “I'd better call my lawyer,” I told him.
     I went outside to a public phone booth and called, not a lawyer, but the doctor.
     “That never happened,” he said.
     I returned to the D.A.'s office and told him that my lawyer said to continue being uncooperative. Then I just sat there waiting for the cops.
     “They're on their way,” the D.A. kept warning me. But at two o'clock, he simply said, “Okay, you can go home now.”
Bronx District Attorney (later Judge) Burton Roberts took a different approach. In September 1969, he told me that his staff had found an abortionist's financial records, which showed all the money that I had received, but he would grant me immunity from prosecution if I cooperated with the grand jury. He extended his hand as a gesture of trust.
     “That's not true,” I said, refusing to shake hands with him.
     If I had ever accepted any money, I'd have no way of knowing that he was bluffing. The D.A. was angry, but he finally had to let me go.
Attorney Gerald Lefcourt (later president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers) filed a suit on my behalf, challenging the constitutionality of the abortion law. He pointed out that the district attorney had no power to investigate the violation of an unconstitutional law, and therefore he could not force me to testify.
     In 1970, I became the only plaintiff in the first lawsuit to declare the abortion laws unconstitutional in New York State. “Later, various women’s groups joined the suit,” Lefcourt recalls, “and ultimately the New York legislature repealed the criminal sanctions against abortion, prior to the Supreme Court decision in Roe vs. Wade.”
Dr. Spencer never knew about that. He had died in 1969. The obituary in the New York Times acknowledged the existence of his abortion clinic.  The obituary in the local paper in Ashland did not.
I continued to carry on my underground abortion referral service. Each time, though, I would flash on the notion that this was my own mother asking for help, and that she was pregnant with me. I would try to identify with the fetus that was going to be aborted even while I was serving as a conduit to the performance of that very abortion. Every day I would think about the possibility of never having existed, and I would only appreciate being alive all the more.
     Of course, I couldn’t possibly have known the difference if my fetus had been aborted. Pretending to be the fetus was just a way of focusing on my role as a referral service. I didn't want it to become so casual that I would grow unaware of the implications. By personalizing it, I had to accept my own responsibility for each fetus whose potential I was helping to disappear. That was about as mystical as I got. Maybe I was simply projecting my own ego.
     In any case, by the time these women came to me for help, they had already searched their souls and made up their minds. This was not some abstract cause far away–-these were real people in real distress--and I just couldn't say no. For nearly a decade, that became my fetal yoga. And, in the process, I had evolved from a satirist into an activist.










There Are No Atheists in the White House

It was God who instructed Bill O’Reilly to consider every utterance of “Happy Holidays” to be a verbalization of “the war on Christmas.”  Whenever anybody claims that God talks directly to them, I think they’re totally delusional. George W. Bush is no exception. Not only was he told by his senior adviser, Karen Hughes, not to refer to terrorists as “folks,” but Bush was also being prompted by God Him-Her-or-Itself: “God would tell me, ‘George, go and end the tyranny in Iraq.’ And I did.” As if he were merely following divine orders.
In July 2003, during a meeting with Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas, Bush told the newly elected leader, “God told me to strike at Al-Qaeda and I struck them, and then He instructed me to strike at Saddam, which I did. And now I am determined to solve the problem in the Middle East. If you help me, I will act, and if not, the elections will come and I will have to focus on them.”
Abu Bakar Bashir, an Islamic cleric and accused terrorist leader, has said that “America’s aim in attacking Iraq is to attack Islam, so it is justified for Muslims to target America to defend themselves.” That’s exactly interchangeable with this description of Bush by an unidentified family member, quoted in the Los Angeles Times: “George sees [the war on terror] as a religious war. His view is that they are trying to kill the Christians. And the Christians will strike back with more force and more ferocity than they will ever know.”
Indeed, General William Boykin, Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence, said that “George Bush was not elected by a majority of the voters in the United States, he was appointed by God.” Discussing the battle against a Muslim warlord in Somalia, Boykin explained, “I knew my God was bigger than his. I knew that my God was a real God and his was an idol.”
Apparently, religious bigotry runs in the family. Bush’s father, the former president: “I don’t know that atheists should be considered citizens, nor should they be considered patriots. This is one nation under God.” And before him, there was Ronald Reagan: “For the first time ever, everything is in place for the Battle of Armageddon and the Second Coming of Christ.” Not to mention Reagan’s Secretary of the Interior, James Watt, responsible for national policy on the environment: “We don't have to protect the environment--the Second Coming is at hand.”
In 1966, Lyndon Johnson told the Austrian ambassador that the diety “comes and speaks to me about two o’clock in the morning when I have to give the word to the boys, and I get the word from God whether to bomb or not.” So maybe there’s some kind of bipartisan theological tradition going on in the White House.  
But if these leaders are not delusional, then they’re deceptive. And in order to deceive others, one must first deceive oneself until self-deception morphs into virtual reality. In any case, we have our religious fanatics, and they have theirs. In September 2007, on the eve of the sixth anniversary of 9/11, Osama bin Laden warned the American people that they should reject their capitalist way of life and embrace Islam to end the Iraq war, or else his followers would “escalate the killing and fighting against you.”
George Bush once proclaimed, “God is not neutral,” which is the antithesis of my own spiritual path, my own peculiar relationship with the universe--based on the notion that God is totally neutral--though I’ve learned that whatever people believe in, works for them. 
My own belief in a deity disappeared when I was thirteen. I was working early mornings in a candy store across the street from our apartment building. My job was to insert different sections of the newspaper into the main section. On the day after the United States dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, I would read that headline over and over and over again while I was working. That afternoon, I told God I couldn’t believe in him any more because--even though he was supposed to be a loving and all-powerful being--he had allowed such devastation to happen. And then I heard the voice of God:
“ALLOWED?  WHY DO YOU THINK I GAVE HUMANS FREE WILL?”
“Okay, well, I’m exercising my free will to believe that you don’t exist.”
“ALL RIGHT, PAL, IT’S YOUR LOSS!”
At least we would remain on speaking terms. But I knew it was a game. I enjoyed the paradox of developing a dialogue with a being whose reality now ranked with that of Santa Claus. Our previous relationship had instilled in me a touchstone of objectivity that could still serve to help keep me honest. I realized, though, that whenever I prayed, I was only talking to myself.
The only thing I can remember from my entire college education is a definition of philosophy as “the rationalization of life.” For my term paper, I decided to write a dialogue between Plato and an atheist. On a whim, I looked up Atheism in the Manhattan phone book, and there it was: “Atheism, American Association for the Advancement of.” I went to their office for background material.
The AAAA sponsored the Ism Forum, where anybody could speak about any “ism” of their choice. I invited a few friends to meet me there. The event was held in a dingy hotel ballroom. There was a small platform with a podium at one end of the room and heavy wooden folding chairs lined around the perimeter. My favorite speaker declared the Eleventh Commandment: “Thou shalt not take thyself too goddamned seriously.” Taking that as my unspoken theme, I got up and parodied the previous speakers. The folks there were mostly middle-aged and elderly. They seemed to relish the notion of fresh young blood in their movement.
However, my companions weren’t interested in staying. If I had left with them that evening in 1953, the rest of my life could have taken a totally different path. Instead, I went along with a group to a nearby cafeteria, where I learned about the New York Rationalist Society. A whole new world of disbelief was opening up to me. That Saturday night I went to their meeting. The emcee was a former circus performer who entertained his fellow rationalists by putting four golf balls into his mouth.  He also recommended an anti-censorship paper, The Independent.
The next week, I went to their office to subscribe and get back issues. I ended up with a part-time job, stuffing envelopes for a dollar an hour. My apprenticeship had begun. The editor, Lyle Stuart, was the most dynamic individual I’d ever met. His integrity was such that if he possessed information that he had a vested interest in keeping quiet--say, corruption involving a corporation in which he owned stock--it would become top priority for him to publish. Lyle became my media mentor, my unrelenting guru, and my closest friend. He was responsible for launching The Realist. The masthead announced, “Freethought Criticism and Satire.”

In the words of the late Jerry Falwell--who once said that God is pro-war--“If you’re not a born-again Christian, you’re a failure as a human being.” We salute, then, a few successful human beings:
*The individual who placed the winning bid of $1800 on eBay for a slab of concrete with a smudge of driveway sealant resembling the face of Jesus.
	*The man who tried to crucify himself after seeing “pictures of God on the computer.” He took two pieces of wood, nailed them together in the form of a cross and placed it on his living-room floor. He proceeded to hammer one of his hands to the crucifix, using a 14-penny nail. According to a county sheriff spokesperson, “When he realized that he was unable to nail his other hand to the board, he called 911.” It was unclear whether he was seeking assistance for his injury or help in nailing his other hand.
*The Sunday School teacher who advised one of his students to write on his penis, “What would Jesus do?” Presumably, “Masturbate” was not considered to be the correct answer.
*And, of course, the anonymous authors of the following quotes from various state constitutions. Arkansas: “No person who denies the being of a God shall hold any office.”  Mississippi: “No person who denies the existence of a Supreme Being shall hold any office in this state.” North Carolina: “The following persons shall be disqualified for office: First, any person who shall deny the being of Almighty God.” South Carolina: “No person shall be eligible to the office of Governor who denies the existence of the Supreme Being.” Tennessee: “No person who denies the being of God, or a future state of rewards and punishments, shall hold any office in the civil department of this state.” Texas: “Nor shall any one be excluded from holding office on account of his religious sentiments, provided he acknowledge the existence of a Supreme Being.”


Rick Warren, pastor of America’s fourth-largest church, told his congregation, “I could not vote for an atheist because an atheist says, ‘I don’t need God.’”
In 2006, the Secular Coalition of America offered a $1,000 prize to anyone who identified the highest-ranking non-theist public official in the country. Almost 60 members of Congress were nominated, out of which 22 confided that they didn’t believe in a Supreme Being, but they wanted their disbelief kept secret. Only Pete Stark admitted that he was a nonbeliever, and in 2007, he became the first member of Congress ever to identify himself publicly as a nonbeliever.
In the week following that announcement, he received over 5,000 emails from around the globe, almost all congratulating him for his courage. “Like our nation’s founders,” he stated, “I strongly support the separation of church and state. I look forward to working with the Secular Coalition to stop the promotion of narrow religious beliefs in science, marriage contracts, the military and the provision of social services.” In 2008, he was elected to his 19th term with 76.5% of the votes.
In the 2008 primaries, three presidential wannabes raised their hands during a Republican “debate” to signify that they didn’t believe in evolution, although one of them, Mike Huckabee, admitted, “I don’t know if the world was created in six days. I wasn’t there.” He has also said that, “If there was ever an occasion for someone to have argued against the death penalty, I think Jesus could have done so on the cross and said, ‘This is an unjust punishment, and I deserve clemency.’” 
     Such western fundamentalists have been waging a battle against the teaching of meditation in publicly funded schools, as though slow, deep breathing is inextricably connected with the practice of eastern religious disciplines. What’s next, forbidding the teaching of empathy because that’s what Christians and Jews are supposed to practice?
     It was a pleasant surprise when Barack Obama acknowledged “unbelievers” among others in his inauguration speech. However, I don’t exempt unbelievers from criticism.
     I ridicule officially atheist China’s leaders for banning Tibet’s living Buddhas from reincarnation without permission. According to the order, issued by the State Administration for Religious Affairs, “The so-called reincarnated living Buddha without government approval is illegal and invalid.” That regulation is aimed at limiting the influence of the Dalai Lama, even though China officially denies the possibility of reincarnation. (I used to believe in reincarnation, but that was in a previous lifetime.)
China is a Big-Brother, slave-labor-driven, human-rights-violator, Maoist dictatorship, from which the United States borrows trillions, then proceeds to purchase their poisoned food, leaded Christmas toys, and “Made in China” American flags. 
     America remains a living paradox, where our citizens are force-fed misinformation and disinformation, so that we can continue to fund incompetent and illegal activities in the U.S.--even though our revolution was fought because of taxation without representation. And yet I live in this country where at least I still have complete freedom to openly condemn the government, the corporations and organized religions that continue enabling each other to reek with greed, corruption, and inhumanity.









     THE SEX LIFE OF PRESIDENTS & OTHERS


The Parts Left Out of the Kennedy Book

An executive in the publishing industry, who obviously must remain anonymous, has made available to The Realist a photostat copy of the original manuscript of William Manchester's book, The Death of a President. Those passages which are printed here were marked for deletion months before Harper & Row sold the serialization rights to Look magazine; hence they do not appear even in the so-called “complete” version published by the German magazine Stern.
#
At the Democratic National Convention in the summer of 1960, Los Angeles was the scene of a political visitation of the alleged sins of the father upon the son. Lyndon Johnson found himself battling for the presidential nomination with a young, handsome, charming and witty adversary, John F. Kennedy.
The Texan in his understandable anxiety degenerated to a strange campaign tactic. He attacked his opponent on the grounds that his father, Joseph P. Kennedy, was a Nazi sympathizer during the time he was United States Ambassador to Great Britain, from 1938 to 1940. The senior Kennedy had predicted that Germany would defeat England and he therefore urged President Franklin D. Roosevelt to withhold aid. Now Johnson found himself fighting pragmatism with pragmatism. It did not work; he lost the nomination.
Ironically, the vicissitudes of regional bloc voting forced Kennedy into selecting Johnson as his running mate. Jack rationalized the practicality of the situation, but Jackie was constitutionally unable to forgive Johnson. Her attitude toward him always remained one of controlled paroxysm.
It was common knowledge in Washington social circles that the Chief Executive was something of a ladies' man. His staff included a Secret Service agent, referred to by the code name Dentist, whose duties virtually centered around escorting him to and from a rendezvous site-–either in the District of Columbia or while traveling--the models, actresses and other strikingly attractive females chosen by the president for his not-at-all infrequent trysts. “Get me that,” he had said of a certain former Dallas beauty contest winner when plans for the tour were first being discussed. That particular aspect of the itinerary was changed, of course, when Mrs. Kennedy decided to accompany her husband.
She was aware of his philandering, but would cover up her dismay by joking, “It runs in the family.” The story had gotten back to her about the late Marilyn Monroe using the telephone in her Hollywood bathroom to make a long distance call to New York Post film-gossip columnist Sidney Skolsky.
“Sid, you won't believe this,” she had whispered, “but the Attorney General of our country is waiting for me in my bed this very minute-–I just had to tell you.”
*   *   *
It is difficult to ascertain where on the continuum of Lyndon Johnson's personality innocent boorishness ends and deliberate sadism begins. To have summoned then-Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon for a conference wherein he, the new president, sat defecating as he spoke, might charitably be an example of the former; but to challenge under the same circumstances Senator J. William Fulbright for his opposition to Administration policy in Vietnam is considered by insiders to be a frightening instance of the latter. The more Jacqueline Kennedy has tried to erase the crudeness of her husband's successor from consciousness, the more it has impinged upon her memories and reinforced her resentment. “It's beyond style,” she would confide to friends. “Jack had style, but this is beyond style.”
When Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. related to her an incident that he had witnessed firsthand-–Mr. Johnson had actually placed his penis over the railing of the yacht, bragging to onlookers, “Watch it touch bottom!”–-Mrs. Kennedy could not help but shiver with disgust. Capitol Hill reporters have observed the logical extension of Mr. Johnson boasting about his six-o'clock-in-the-morning forays with Lady Bird, to his bursts of phallic exhibitionism, whether it be on a boat or at the swimming pool or in the lavatory. Apropos of this tendency, Drew Pearson's assistant, Jack Anderson, has remarked: “When Lyndon announces there's going to be a joint session of Congress, everybody cringes.”
It is true that Mrs. Kennedy withstood the pressures of publicized scandal, ranging from the woman who picketed the White House carrying a blown-up photograph supposedly of Jack Kennedy sneaking away from the home of Jackie's press secretary, Pamela Turnure, to the Blauvelt Family Genealogy which claimed on page 884, under Eleventh Generation, that one Durie Malcolm had “married, third, John F. Kennedy, son of Joseph P. Kennedy, one time Ambassador to England.” But it was the personal infidelities that gnawed away at her–-as indeed they would gnaw away at any wife who has been shaped by this culture-–until finally Jackie left in exasperation. Her father-in-law offered her one million dollars to reconcile. She came back, not for the money, but because she sincerely believed that the nation needed Jack Kennedy, and she didn't want to bear the burden of losing enough public favor to forestall his winning the presidency.
Consequently she was destined to bear a quite different burden--with great ambivalence--the paradox of fame. She enjoyed playing her role to the hilt, but complained, “Can't they get it into their heads that there's a difference between being the First Lady and being Elizabeth Taylor?” Even after she became First Widow, the movie magazines would not--or could not--leave her alone. Probably the most bizarre invasion of her privacy occurred in Photoplay, which asked the question, “Too Soon for Love?”-–then proceeded to print a coupon that readers were requested to answer and send in. They had a multiple choice: “Should Jackie (1) Devote her life exclusively to her children and the memory of her husband? (2) Begin to date--privately or publicly--and eventually remarry? (3) “Marry right away?” Mrs. Kennedy fumed. “Why don't they give them some more decisions to make for me? Some real ones. Should I live in occasional sin? Should I use a diaphragm or the pill? Should I keep it in the medicine cabinet or the bureau drawer?” But she would never lose her dignity in public; she had too deep a faith in her own image.
*   *   *
American leaders seem to have a schizophrenic approach toward each other. They want to expose their human frailties at the same time that they do not want to remove them from their pedestals. Bobby Kennedy privately abhors Lyndon Johnson, but publicly calls him “great, and I mean that in every sense of the word.” Johnson has referred to Bobby as “that little shit” in private, but continues to laud him for the media. Gore Vidal has no such restraint. On a television program in London, he explained why Jacqueline Kennedy would never relate to Lyndon Johnson. During that tense flight from Dallas to Washington after the assassination, she inadvertently walked in on him as he was standing over the casket of his predecessor and chuckling. This disclosure was the talk of London, but did not reach these shores.
Of course, President Johnson is often given to inappropriate response--witness the puzzled timing of his smiles when he speaks of grave matters--but we must also assume that Mrs. Kennedy had been traumatized that day and her perception was likely to have been tainted by the tragedy. This state of shock must have underlain an incident on Air Force One which this writer conceives to be delirium, but which Mrs. Kennedy insists she actually saw. “I'm telling you this for the historical record,” she said, “so that people a hundred years from now will know what I had to go through.”
She corroborated Gore Vidal's story, continuing: “That man [Johnson] was crouching over the corpse, no longer chuckling but breathing hard and moving his body rhythmically. At first I thought he must be performing some mysterious symbolic rite he'd learned from Mexicans or Indians as a boy. And then I realized--there is only one way to say this--he was literally fucking my husband in the throat. In the bullet wound in the front of his throat. He reached a climax and dismounted. I froze. The next thing I remember, he was being sworn in as the new president.”
[Handwritten marginal notes: 1. Check with Rankin--did secret autopsy show semen in throat wound? 2. Is this simply necrophilia, or was LBJ trying to change entry wound from grassy knoll into exit wound from Book Depository by enlarging it?]
The glaze lifted from Jacqueline Kennedy's eyes.
“I don't believe that Lyndon Johnson had anything to do with a conspiracy, but I do know this--Jack taught me about the nuances of power--if he were miraculously to come back to life and suddenly appear in front of him, the first thing Johnson would do now is kill him.” She smiled sardonically, adding, “Unless Bobby beat him to it.”
Postscript:
The most significant thing about “The Parts Left Out of the Kennedy Book” was its widespread acceptance--if only for a moment--by intelligent, literate people, from an ACLU official to a Peabody Award-winning journalist to members of the intelligence community who knew that sort of thing actually does go on. Daniel Ellsberg said, “Maybe it was just because I wanted to believe it so badly.”
One caller claimed that he could determine, by feeding the article into a computer, whether Manchester had written the portions I published. Several individuals queried that final arbiter of truth, the Playboy Adviser. One reader “went out and bought the original Death of a President just to see if your parts would fit into the book--they did. Amazing!”
I also received a call from Ray Marcus, a critic of the Warren Commission Report, who had discovered a chronological flaw in my article. How could William Manchester leave something out of his book that was itself a report of something that he’d left out of his book? Marcus deduced that The Realist must have been given the excerpts by a CIA operative in order to discredit valid dissent on the assassination.
My favorite response came from Merriman Smith, the syndicated UPI correspondent who always ended White House press conferences with the traditional “Thank you, Mr. President.” He wrote:
“One of the filthiest printed attacks ever made on a President of the United States is now for sale on Washington newsstands. The target: President Johnson. This is the May edition of a so-called magazine which says it is entered as second class mail. One newsstand owner says sales of this particular issue have been ‘quite active.’ This reporter is not embarked here on any defense of Johnson politically or personally, nor, for that matter, is this to suggest the need for greater respect for the presidency.
     “These are matters that have been dealt with extensively in other forums. Certain unadorned facts, however, do stand out in the open circulation, mailing and other forms of distribution of this sort of slime: If a magazine of major national standing tries to use the same sort of language, federal action to stop it would be almost certain. The language referred to is not conventional hell or damn profanity–-it is filth attributed to someone of national stature supposedly describing something Johnson allegedly did. The incident, of course, never took place . . .”

A Sneak Preview of Richard Nixon’s Memoir

An old friend approached us with a thick sheaf of what was purported to be a photocopy of the autobiographical manuscript on which former President Richard M. Nixon was still at work. Our first reaction was skepticism. While most of the contents dealt predictably with contemporary history as it has already been recorded, there were enough surprises to shock even our own jaded psyche.
Just to be sure, we employed the services of a reputable private investigative firm. Their report verified that our source did indeed know an individual inside the San Clemente hideaway. The next step was to hire a professional graphologist, who determined the authenticity of Mr. Nixon’s handwritten notes on the typed transcript. Finally, our attorneys assured us that there was no violation of copyright laws involved, because it was unlikely that Nixon had submitted such unfinished material for copyright protection.
The book, as yet untitled, is dedicated “To Patricia Ryan Nixon, who has been named the most admired women in the country, and deservedly so, for your loyalty has been a continuing inspiration, not only to your husband and family, but to Americans everywhere.” Here, then, are several excerpts from this preliminary draft of the memoirs of the only United States president ever to resign from office.
#
Although President Dwight David Eisenhower encouraged me to call him Ike during the years I served as Vice President, it was a superficial form of intimacy. I regretted his failure to share decision-making responsibility with me at the White House. That privilege he reserved for his special assistant, Sherman Adams.
When media coverage of a minor scandal in 1958 involving a rug and a vicuna coat pressured him into letting Adams go, Ike at last revealed a facet of his humanity to me. “By sheer force of habit,” he remarked, “I was ready to seek out Sherman’s advice on whether or not I should fire him.”
It was not until 1961, after Ike’s farewell address, that he confided in me again, this time about a more momentous occasion. “I suppose,” he began, “my reference to the dangers of the military-industrial complex in my speech came as something of a surprise to you, eh?”
“Well, sir, it did strike me as a rather incongruous position for a renowned Army general to take--”
“I had a visitation,” he interrupted, “while I was in the process of composing my farewell address—now this is utterly impossible to describe—but I do believe it was some kind of extraterrestrial communication.”
“In English or what?” I was dumbfounded.
“It was in English but also beyond all language. They told me that their associates had been to see Harry Truman when he was president. Now remember Dick, he’s the one who ordered the atomic bomb to be dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And yet these creatures convinced him not to turn Korea into another nuclear holocaust. That’s really why he brought back General Douglas MacArthur.”
Ike stared ahead with a blank expression in his eyes.
“Sir, are you all right?”
“Yes. Yes. I just don’t know if I can articulate this extraterrestrial experience. It was as though my body remained in the chair and my spirit was taken on a journey. All I know is that when I returned, I just had to tell the truth. There was no other choice--”
Ike stopped in mid-sentence. He never mentioned that incident again. Nor did I feel it would be proper for me to broach the subject. I dismissed it from my mind. It would not be until nearly fourteen years later that my visceral understanding of his experience would occur.
The year 1974 was so rough on me that for a while I thought I could actually be going insane. I wondered if I was being drugged without my knowledge. I found myself wallowing in paranoid fantasies, and I gave voice to these at press conferences. I expressed the fear that my plane might crash. I resorted to using expressions like “They can point a gun at your head.” I was practically begging for mercy.
When I entered Memorial Hospital Medical Center in Long Beach on October 23 for my phlebitis condition, I brought my own jar of wheat germ, because I was afraid that poison would be put in my food.
On October 29, the doctors placed a clamp on a vein in my pelvis in order to prevent the blood clot from moving to my lungs where it could have killed me. It was then that I went into cardiovascular failure.
On October 30, Ron Ziegler announced, “We almost lost President Nixon yesterday afternoon.” This was almost three months after my resignation, and he was still referring to me as President. “Poor Ron,” I thought to myself. “He thinks he’s still in Disneyland.”
For a few hours I was considered to be clinically dead. It was an incredibly ecstatic feeling. I was conscious, but on some other plane of existence, and there was an overwhelming temptation to remain in that blissful limbo. Yet there was also something in me that kept saying “Don’t give up!” It was my survival instinct speaking.
But why not give up? What was there left for me? The answer came to me by the same extraterrestrial path it had come to Ike: Tell the truth! That was the turning point of my life. And these memoirs are the tangible result of my transformation. No one shall be spared, least of all myself.
Those hairless creatures told me that President John F. Kennedy had also been visited by their kind. His father, old Joe Kennedy, had gotten rich off illegal booze during Prohibition, and you can be certain that the underworld bootleggers he was tied up with were not about to dissolve their silent partnership in this huge liquor industry they had built up, simply because Prohibition had been repealed. Yet there was Joe Kennedy’s own son, Jack—not to mention his brother Bobby—refusing to cooperate any longer in allowing organized crime to have a comeback in Cuba, and furthermore, going after organized crime in this country. At best this was ingratitude; at worst it was treason.
But I finally understood the extraterrestrial force that had motivated young Kennedy. And so now I am ready to peel away the final layers of my poker-face mask.
For example, I occasionally went too far while wearing my anti-Communist mask. When former Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach exposed the DuBois Clubs as a Communist front organization, poison-pen letters and threatening telephone calls were received by many of the Boys Clubs from patriotic Americans who were understandably confused by the ostensibly coincidental pronunciations. But in my function as National Board Chairman of the Boys Clubs of America, I charged that the name choice was “an almost classic example of Communist deception and duplicity” and that the W.E.B. DuBois Clubs “are not unaware of the confusion they are causing among our supporters and among many other good citizens.”
In retrospect, however, I admit that this was a slightly foolish position to espouse.
*   *   *
In August of 1945, while I was still serving in the Navy, stationed in Maryland, there was a Committee of 100 seeking—according to an advertisement they placed in several California newspapers—a candidate for Congress “with no previous political experience, to defeat a man who has represented the district in the House for ten years.” This was a reference to Jerry Voorhis.
I did not see the ad, but destiny acted as though I had answered it, when I was contacted by Murray Chotiner for Herman Perry, vice president of the Bank of America. Perry later became vice president of the Western Tube Corporation, a CIA front located in the Whittier Bank of America building. But now he wanted to know only if I was a Republican and if I was available.
My responses were both affirmative.
It was Perry who brought me out for an extremely brief meeting with Howard Hughes. Hughes was handsome, dynamic, self-assured. Somehow he had seen the FBI dossier on me, which had apparently been compiled when I applied for a position with the Bureau after graduating law school. Oddly enough, I had never heard back from the FBI directly.
“Nixon,” he addressed me, “you have a magnificent political future ahead. You will be able to steer your ship independently. But always keep it in a tiny compartment of your mind that you do not own the ocean. I do.”
I never saw Howard Hughes face to face again.
*   *   *
The seeds of my distrust of the Justice Department were sown in 1948 during the Alger Hiss case. Those people just sat on each other’s hands. If not for the work of our House UnAmerican Activities Committee, the prosecution would never have been so successful.
I refused to turn over to those bunglers the microfilms we had in evidence. When there was a possibility I might be cited for contempt, I raised the point of what a dangerous precedent could be set, since here I was, a U.S. Congressman, appearing voluntarily before a grand jury.
But the truth of the matter was that those microfilms were copies of documents forged on an old Woodstock typewriter that had been specially constructed to resemble—to have the same peculiarities as—the typewriter that had actually belonged to Alger Hiss’s wife, Priscilla.
Then Whittaker Chambers hid these “old” 1938 microfilms inside a pumpkin on his pumpkin farm. The trouble was, the Eastman Kodak people stated that the type of film we used was not manufactured by their company until 1945.
To this day, whenever the comic strip Peanuts mentions that bird named Woodstock or the mysterious “pumpkin papers,” I suspect Charles Schulz is trying to remind me of something.
*   *   *
There seems to be a tradition of accusing those who fight Communism of being homosexual. This smear tactic was used against Whittaker Chambers, against Senator Joseph McCarthy and against J. Edgar Hoover. In that vein, gossips used to rant about Hoover and Clyde Tolson double-dating with Charles “Bebe” Rebozo and myself.
Neither Rebozo nor I are “gay.” We have been very close friends since 1950. What we enjoy most about each other’s company is the fact that small talk becomes unnecessary. We are not afraid of silence. But we have never had any kind of sexual relationship.
We were introduced by Senator George Smathers, who was infamous for supplying female companions to his fellow legislators. It was Smathers who eventually sent Mary Jo Kopechne to be with Senator Edward Kennedy.
Whenever I was in Florida, I would stay with Bebe, and he would occasionally get a couple of beautiful $200-a-night girls. Or as they would be called nowadays, $200-a-night women. But when I bought my own home in Key Biscayne, then his yacht became our rendezvous site.
I was certainly not promiscuous, but I had been a virgin until marriage. I proposed to Pat Ryan the very same night I met her. She refused, but I was a determined son-of-a-gun. I even drove her to Los Angeles when she dated other men while I waited in the wings. I finally charmed her with my perseverance and self-effacement.
Once I express concern to Bebe that word might get out about my “affairs” in Key Biscayne. “These girls,” I pointed out, “are likely to brag about going to bed with a United States senator.”
“They’re professionals,” Bebe reassured me. “It’s just like your lawyer-client privilege. Stop worrying.”
*   *   *
One evening in 1949, while I was still serving in Congress, I received an anonymous call at my home. A male voice said three words, “Watch Jeane Dixon,” and hung up the telephone.
A week later, the psychic Jeane Dixon held a press conference. One of the reporters asked her to predict my future. She drew a blank, however, explaining that she needed time to meditate. I believe that in show business parlance this is known as “milking the audience.” Finally she said it: “I predict that one day Richard Nixon will become president of the United States.”
I could only conclude that the higher source from which she had received her intelligence was not necessarily supernatural. When I lost the presidential election to John F. Kennedy in 1960, Jeane Dixon continued to predict that I would be president. “Destiny,” she said, “cannot be denied.”
Even after I was defeated in the 1962 California gubernatorial election and announced that I was through with politics, she said, “Richard Nixon has not even begun his rise in politics.” And then she predicted the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963.
After the Watergate affair, she stated: “God gave us Richard Nixon to divide us, to test us where our faith is concerned, to see if we could come together.” A local paper published her statement (“God gave us Nixon to divide us.—Jeane Dixon”) as the caption for a cartoon showing a cloud with the voice of God saying, “Don’t blame me—I voted for McGovern.” I had to admit it was funny, even though she had been quoted out of context.
*   *   *
Harry Robbins “Bob” Haldeman came into my life when I was a senator in 1951. He volunteered to work on my vice presidential campaign the next year, but that campaign was not to be for him, so he tried again in 1956, and this time we took him on. He rose to be my chief advance man for the presidential race in 1960.
After my defeat, Haldeman remained loyal. He volunteered to help me with my book, Six Crises. I wrote the chapter on the 1960 campaign myself because it was so fresh in my mind. Al Moscow drafted four other chapters with Haldeman—this was not ghostwritten material because I rewrote what they presented—and Haldeman worked mostly on the Alger Hiss chapter.
He was apparently so eager to please, though, that he screwed up on his research. He had it that the FBI found the old Woodstock typewriter. And the book was published that way. Then the facts came out, the trial records and all, and we had to change it for the paperback edition. So now it reads that the FBI was unable to find the typewriter.
The truth is, Alger Hiss found it himself. But the FBI had planted this fake Woodstock typewriter. And then the defense presented it in the trial as what they assumed was evidence in their favor. So a least Hiss was found guilty of perjury.
That verdict added immeasurably to my political strength. I had the courage of Alger Hiss’s conviction and it served as the magic carpet that transported me from the Congress to the Senate to the vice presidency. I would have had the presidency in my pocket if not for Kennedy’s performance in the Great Debates—but only on television; I fared better on radio. Kennedy’s charisma was the variable that none of us had counted on.
*   *   *
     How strange that the incident from the entire eight years I spent as Vice President that stands out most prominently in my memory occurred not in the White House but in Peru. There was a rioter who spat on me, and it was with great pleasure that I kicked him in the shins.
Back in the safety of our hotel that night, I recalled an early formal debate at Whittier College—“Resolved: that insects are more beneficial than harmful”—because I had been so intrigued as to how insects did not think, they just acted. Now, having myself acted totally without hesitation, I was able to identify with those insects.
As Vice President, I labored diligently behind the scenes to establish Operation 40, by which our CIA covertly trained Cuban intelligence officers in exile. Operation 40 was to serve as our link between the White House and the CIA in April of 1961. My plan was to invade Cuba.
Ironically, during the 1960 presidential campaign, Kennedy began advocating my plan. I could not reveal that it was already in effect because Operation 40 was a secret project. Further, I found myself in the schizophrenic position of attacking my own idea whenever Kennedy articulated it, because it violated our treaty commitments.

Of all the professional newscasters I have met, Walter Cronkite of CBS was the most charming. He treated me with respect and dignity. After the broadcast interview, we sat in his anteroom and talked informally.
“I’ve always wanted to thank you,” he said, “for inadvertently bringing me back to sanity that horrible weekend John Kennedy was killed.”
“Oh, really—how so?”
“This followed on the heels of the televised shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby. A journalist asked for your reaction, and you replied with a slip of the tongue, ‘Two rights don’t make a wrong.’ Before you could correct yourself, I was finally able to break through my depression with a bit of laughter.”
“Yes, those were muddled times. Do you know I forgot where I was the day the assassination took place? I had to tell the FBI I couldn’t remember, and it was not until later that I remembered I had been in Dallas, of all places. There was a convention of the American Bottlers of Carbonated Beverages, and I was there representing Pepsi-Cola. But I flew out of there at eleven o’clock that morning. Kennedy was shot around one o’clock, as I recall. Where were you that day?”
“In my office,” Cronkite said. “When we got the word from Bethesda that he had passed, I cried  openly.”
“And you’re supposed to be objective,” I teased him. “I didn’t realize you were that much of a Kennedy supporter.”
“Well, by that time I was crying because it had also come over the wires that Lyndon Johnson was already preparing to be sworn in as the new president.”
It was encouraging to find that in person this superstar really was just like your favorite uncle.

When Robert Kennedy was attorney general in 1962, he was busy checking out the Hiss case for some reason. Of course, he discovered that the FBI never had the Woodstock typewriter.
Then, in 1968, when he was running for president, he approached New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison to be his attorney general. Garrison had gotten a lot of publicity due to his investigation of the assassination of Bobby’s brother.
During that campaign, Howard Hughes dispatched Robert Maheu to visit me. Hughes felt strongly that the Vietnam War should continue—he had a huge defense contract for helicopters—yet at the same time he wanted a halt to underground nuclear testing, presumably because it upset the roulette wheels in his Las Vegas casinos.
I mentioned the Bobby Kennedy information to Maheu, and he said, “Uh-oh, the boss will have to keep a sharper eye on him.”
It was poetic irony that while Bobby Kennedy was giving official permission to J. Edgar Hoover to spy on Martin Luther King, I was giving unofficial permission to Hoover to spy on Kennedy. That is to say, Robert Maheu may have been working for Howard Hughes, but he had also continued working for the FBI. So when he referred to “the boss,” I asked, “Which one?”
Maheu smiled and held up his arms, two fingers from each hand extending up into the air. “Both,” he said. This was the exact moment I decided to use that gesture for the crowds.
Winston Churchill had used the V-sign to signify Victory. Then the antiwar protesters perverted its meaning to signify Defeat. Now I was restoring its original victorious symbolism by co-opting the co-opters. Or so I believed.

     The problem was that Lyndon Johnson desperately wanted to have the Vietnam War settled before he left office. Whereas, I am ashamed to admit, we were trying to prolong it.
Anna Chennault—the Dragon Lady, as we called her—was our liaison to South Vietnamese government officials. Her task was to dissuade their ambassador to the U.S, Bui Diem, from attending the Paris peace talks.
But LBJ got wise to this. I had to call and cajole him personally. He was absolutely furious. He complained bitterly at how “shit-kickin’ pissed off” he was. “Thieu is our boy,” he shouted, “and don’t you fuckin’ forget that!”
On November 1, 1968, only four days before the American election, President Nguyen Van Thieu announced that Saigon was pulling out of the peace talks. The Dragon Lady had obviously convinced his associates that they would obtain a juicier deal under our new administration than under Johnson or his chosen successor, Hubert Humphrey, who would surely have won if the Democrats had ended the war.
And so, because it was in the mutual interest of the South Vietnamese and the Republicans to extend the war for several more years, we became the recipients of kickbacks from our own government’s aid to the Saigon government.
I do not ask for forgiveness. No, rather I must live with the memory of myself as an idealistic adolescent first reading about the Teapot Dome scandal and saying to my mother, while helping her to mash the potatoes, “I would like to become an honest lawyer who can’t be brought by crooks.” But my character had already been set. When I was only five years old, my mother intended to buy me a copy of The Prince and the Pauper, but she asked a bookstore clerk for The Prince, and so of course he gave her Machiavelli’s book. Mo mother was a saint. Her little mistake changed my life, and I will always be grateful for what I feel must have been a touch of divine intervention.

We created a couple of Frankenstein monsters, and when I say we, I mean the administration and the media in an unintentional collaboration.
One such monster was Martha Mitchell. The first time she made one of her famous telephone calls and we saw how the press ate it up, we realized we had a political gold mine. The wife of the attorney general could serve as our mouthpiece for floating various trial balloons.
John Mitchell would get thoroughly briefed on whatever the issue was—Haiphong Harbor or Senator Fulbright or the need for increased spending—and then, without ever letting Martha know that he expected her to give a scoop to some lucky reporter that evening, John would simply smoke his pipe and just happen to engage her in casual conversation about the matter.
Martha was much too strong-willed to be instructed to make a call, but she could be counted on to make the call, even if it was three o’clock in the morning when the urge hit her. This was a great joke among the reporters. One little news item quoted her latest pronouncement, and after the quote that sentence was completed with, “Martha Mitchell confided to the Washington Star yesterday…” Confided, indeed—to a newspaper.
But in the process of becoming a public character, she developed many contacts in the media. By the time her husband became my campaign manager, Martha Mitchell was already a household word. We thought she would prove to be a wonderful asset until she started blabbing about Watergate.
Another Frankenstein monster we created was Henry Kissinger. I never really wanted him in the first place. He had insulted me publicly when I received the nomination in ’68. But I made an agreement with Nelson Rockefeller that if he would actively support me, I would take Kissinger onto the team, and of course I had to keep my word.
We all felt somewhat uncomfortable about his German accent. H.R. Haldeman decided that whenever Kissinger made any statement, his picture could be shown on TV but there would be no audio. And the electronic media cooperated.
Meanwhile, we built up his image, got him dates with glamorous movie stars—Jill St. John, Marlo Thomas, Liv Ullmann—until he became known as a harmless, pudgy playboy. Then it was acceptable for his voice to be heard.
“Henry,” I once remarked to him, “there’s a rumor going around Washington that you’re lousy in bed.”
“Mr. President”—speaking very slowly and distinctly—“I can only say that . . . power . . . is the ultimate aphrodisiac.”
And he just kept glaring at me with those worried-looking eyebrows frowning over his spectacles. This was just three days after our destabilization of the Chilean government. Kissinger wanted all the credit, but it was really a team effort.
We could not have succeeded, for example, without the invaluable aid of Teamsters Union President Frank Fitzsimmons and his Bob Hope-like timing in manipulating the truckers’ strike in Chile. It is possible to bring about the collapse of an entire economy by shutting down one integral aspect, especially communications or transportation.
Moreover, the Soviet Union was trying to cut off the United States’ supply of a metal vital to jet engine production, by their support of the Allende government in Chile and also by backing guerrilla actions in Angola. In order to maintain the war in Vietnam, we needed Chilean copper as well as the trace metal. At any rate, we were a smooth, well-oiled team, on the way to winning the whole, beautiful, global game.

In 1968, George Wallace ran for president as the candidate of the American Independent Party. This almost lost me the election to Hubert Humphrey. In 1972, Wallace ran for president again. This almost cost him his life. I honestly have no knowledge as to how long Arthur Bremer was in our employ, but I do know that the cover story of his having stalked me before he went after Wallace was fabricated simply to defuse any suspicion that might have pointed to our role in the tragic event.
After all, my supposed public mandate that November came from a majority that included twenty million votes that would otherwise have gone to George Wallace. We had not expected him to pose so much of a threat. In fact, we had already taken certain steps to preclude any such possibility. In 1970, immediately after he became governor of Alabama again, the iRS and the Justice Department launched an investigation of Wallace and his brother Gerald for tax evasion and other forms of financial corruption.
I don’t fault Wallace for family loyalty, by the way. I have carried out similar filial responsibility to my own brother, Donald. This is only natural.
In any event, John Mitchell, still attorney general at the time, came to me early in 1971 and said, “We’ve got to stop George Wallace. He could force the election into the House of Representatives if he runs on a third party ticket again.”
In May of that year, I was in Mobile and invited Wallace to fly with me on the presidential plane to Birmingham. En route, we shook hands on an agreement. I promised that Mitchell would call off the investigation of Wallace and his brother—although their underlings would still be subject to prosecution—and the governor in turn promised me that if he ran in ’72 it would only be as a Democrat.
In August 1971, we discovered that CBS correspondent Daniel Schorr had been asking around about the possibility of such a deal. Haldeman commented, “We’d better get on his ass—fast.”
Two years later, when Schorr reported that John Dean was afraid of going to prison because he might get raped there, we were able to find out immediately from the FBI that his source was Dean’s own attorney, but there was nothing constructive we could do with that information.
However, it must be noted for posterity that John Dean was a closet queen supreme. His lovely wife, Maureen, is merely window dressing. Oh, how neatly she rolled up her blond tresses into a perfect bun and sat behind him at the Watergate hearings every day, blatantly projecting a modern-day American Gothic image. I recall how it came out that Dean had taken almost $5,000 from a White House safe for a hurried honeymoon right smack in the middle of the cover-up, He was already disguising his tracks. Their marriage was purely protective coloration.
The case of John Dean does raise the question, when is a so-called leak actually convenient propaganda?
Maureen Dean was an on airplane flight when she “accidentally” dropped her purse and spilled a vial of amyl nitrate capsules on the floor. She explained to the man sitting net to her how wonderful these were for enhancing her sex life with John. Is it not possible that this lady was protesting just a mite too much, particularly to someone who would just happen to let the media in on her secret?
No wonder G. Gordon Liddy said that John Dean was qualified to sing the title role in Der Rosenkavalier—because it is sung by a woman. Liddy once made a remark in German that I asked him to translate for me. He said, “John Dean’s priorities are all screwed up. He doesn’t know whether he wants to go down in history or down on a historian.”
*   *   *
Young people might use the expression “karma returning” to describe a deal we made with Jack Anderson, who had himself exposed the corruption of so many others in his syndicated column for the Washington Post.
We were tipped off that Anderson was researching the Dragon Lady connection. He had learned that her late husband, General Claire Chennault, who had commended the Flying Tigers in World War II, had in 1946 formed a private commercial airline that later merged with the CIA’s Air America.
He also learned that our Dragon Lady was currently profiting from a Pepsi-Cola factory I had established in Laos, but which had never spewed forth a single drop of Pepsi. Air America had been shuttling out its actual product: heroin.
However, Anderson agreed not to publish this material. In return, we agreed not to publicize the fact that he knew about the Watergate break-in weeks before it occurred. He had warned Lawrence O’Brien at Democratic National Committee headquarters, but O’Brien remained silent because he assumed that such a scandal would provide ammunition for a Democrat coup in the ’72 election. He overestimated public outrage.
Anderson held back because he did not wish to endanger his source, one of the “burglars,” Frank Sturgis, whom he had known for some twenty years. Shortly after my resignation in 1974, I received a long letter from Sturgis. I shall quote here a portion of that correspondence:
Now, I’m telling you this because I still consider you my Commander in Chief. I realize that the same faction of the CIA that masterminded the assassination of Kennedy was also behind your downfall. They thought JFK was soft on Communism in Cuba, and that you were soft on Communism in China, but that they didn’t necessarily have to kill you to get rid of you.

While I participated in Operation 40, our job was primarily to infiltrate foreign countries. I was a member of the Assassination Section. Orders would filter down, and our job would be to kill, say, a military official or a politician. Even in those days, unstated policy included domestic as well as foreign enemies.

But I had nothing to do with the Kennedy assassination myself. The FBI came to interview me the day after it happened, and I didn’t have a thing to tell them, except that I could agree with their speculation that the motive was revenge for the Bay of Pigs failure. There’s no doubt in my mind that if you had been elected in 1960, the invasion would have been completely successful.

For a while I believed that Bernard Barker was the double agent in Watergate, but I have since come to the conclusion that our leader, James McCord, was guided to do the things he did by certain officials in the CIA. We were definitely set up. They used us to eventually destroy the office of the presidency. You were just as expendable as Kennedy.

I shouldn’t have been surprised Mr. McCord was our Security Chief. I myself, as an infiltrator of Castro’s inner circle, rose to Director of Security for the Cuban Air Force and Director of Intelligence. Who can you trust?

Whereas I agree with Frank Sturgis that the Watergate burglars were “set up,” I question the reason he gives. The CIA was fully aware that relations with the People’s Republic of China were bound to open up sooner or later. And of course I wanted to earn credit for that in history.
Rather, I am convinced that there was a power struggle within the Agency. The “faction” to which Sturgis alludes—most likely led by CIA’s Richard Helms—was jealous of the Special Intelligence Unit we had developed inside the White House.
*   *   *
Not only was the Watergate break-in deliberately bungled in order to discredit me, but the White House taping system was never part of my domain. I knew it had been installed by the Secret Service, but I lacked access to the tapes and, more important, to any switch that would shut off a recording device.
I was a prisoner in the Oval Office. A mobile prisoner, to be sure—I could go to the Cabinet Room or the Lincoln Room—but it didn’t make any difference; there were bugs everywhere. They even bugged my cabin at Camp David. I was under more surveillance than Larry O’Brien could ever imagine.
If I had the tapes in my possession, don’t you think I would have gotten rid of them? Just the way I did with those microfilms in the Hiss case. Everybody was recommending this—from John Connally to Chuck Colson—but I simply did not have access to the system.
I should explain that “Bay of Pigs” was our code word for the assassination of President Kennedy. When we were attempting to put the brakes on the FBI investigation of Watergate, I told Haldeman to get word to Helms that otherwise, because of E. Howard Hunt’s involvement, the whole Bay of Pigs thing would open up.
Hunt was the CIA station chief in Mexico when agent Lee Harvey Oswald made contact there in 1963. The whole world already knows what a fiasco the Bay of Pigs operation turned out to be—that is, the invasion of Cuba—but because Kennedy didn’t keep his campaign promise to support the exiles, he then became the prime “Bay of Pigs” target.
Had the Watergate mission not been aborted, Hunt would have continued to simulate documents blaming Kennedy and Ted Sorensen for the murder of Che Guevara, just as he forged those cables blaming Kennedy for the murder of Ngo Dinh Diem.
I hasten to add that Hunt was merely clarifying the issues. The Kennedy Administration was responsible. But what we were trying to do was hurt Ted Kennedy’s chances if he decided to run. However, that is guilt by relationship, which is wrong and irrelevant.

I was convinced that Nelson Rockefeller was behind it all. He had never forgiven me for defeating him for the Republican nomination in 1968. What with that whole 25th Amendment arrangement, I figured their chronological plan was to:
1. Get Spiro Agnew out of office.
2. Replace him with Gerald Ford.
3. Get me out of office.
4. Replace me with Ford.
5. Replace Ford (as vice president) with Rockefeller.
6. Knock off Ford before the election by Squeaky Fromme, Sara 	  	   Jane Moore, whoever.

7. Replace Ford again with Rockefeller, declare martial law and 	 	    cancel the election. Alternatively, this could be done by killing 	 	   Jimmy Carter before the inauguration.

Now I realize how naïve I was. Granted, Carter is more progressive than I am—after all, politics is the art of finding a balance between the status quo and the force of evolution—but it became crystal clear to me that he had made some kind of deal. The intelligence-gathering system knew about G. Harrold Carswell’s tragic gay problem. Now, he would have been a fine prospect for blackmail: “We have this photo of you and a friend in the men’s room, Justice Carswell, but don’t worry, we won’t leak it.” I wonder, if I had been successful in appointing him to the Supreme Court, how would he have voted on the constitutionality of entrapping homosexuals? Anyway, my suspicions were aroused when it did not come out in the media until after the election—immediately before Carter’s inauguration when it was too late to do us any good—that his son Jack had been discharged from the Navy because of marijuana.
Our hammer over George McGovern’s head in 1972 was that his daughter had been hospitalized for an LSD freakout. We never had to resort to using that particular bit of intelligence, however, despite the fact that it was we who had arranged for her to be “dosed” in the first place.

Woodward and Bernstein were not the only ones with reliable sources. According to one of my contacts in the intelligence community, the Democrats’ first choice for a presidential candidate in the 1976 elections was a southern governor—Askew of Florida—but their analysts calculated that Jimmy Carter’s resemblance to Howdy Doody would provide a subconscious association in the minds of voters who were weaned on that folksy puppet.
What the American public does not realize is the impact of the long-range planning that goes on in think tanks such as Stanford Research, the Rand Corporation and the Hudson Institute. They are already beginning to orchestrate the Bimillennium, the 2000th birthday of Christ. The function of Jimmy Carter—with all his religiosity and his talk about not living in sin—is to provide an opening wedge for the Christianization of the United States. The arms manufacturers would be well pleased by a repeat performance of the Crusades. After those Korean bribes via Reverend Moon’s Unification Church and the brainwashing of the Moonies, they’ll finally figure it’s time to make Christ an American again.
Incidentally, Billy Graham recently tried to convert me, the same way he did with that professional gangster, Mickey Cohen. “Think what it would be like,” he sad, “if you were to go on an evangelistic tour with Eldridge Cleaver and Colonel Sanders.”
“You mean the Kentucky Fried Chicken guy?”
“Yes, he has been born again too.”
“No, thank you, Billy, I seem to have found serenity in my own way.”
I truly have been able to gain real humility now that Chuck Colson and Susan Atkins are saying the same things about Jesus Christ that they were once saying about myself and Charles Manson, respectively.

History is an unending conveyor belt that either perpetuates or corrects the inaccuracies of the past.
Therefore, the first thing I wish to point out, concerning that infamous eighteen-and-a-half-minutes gap in the White House tape of June 20, 1972, is that it actually lasted only eighteen-and-a-quarter-minutes. At 10:30 that morning, John Ehrlichman was in my office. We did not discuss Watergate. Before leaving, however, he handed me two sealed envelopes. One contained a gram of cocaine; the other contained a preliminary report on the surveillance of Woodward and Bernstein. This task had been assigned to Tony Ulasewicz immediately after their first story on the break-in was published in the Washington Post.
It was strange. Ehrlichman’s own first assignment had been to spy on the Nelson Rockefeller people for us during the 1960 campaign, and now he had his own chain of command. I have noticed that Ehrlichman’s brow has become more knitted as he has advanced in his career. When he left, I opened the sealed envelope and read the report. It was brief:
Bernstein, Carl: Heavy pot smoker. Living apart from his wife. Began affair with Nora Ephron, Esquire columnist, in New York while her husband, Dan Greenburg, book author, was at EST, Erhard Seminar Training.
Woodward, Bob: A loner. Clean as a hound’s tooth. So far.
Then I began to “chop the coke,” as they say, with a razor blade. When Bob Haldeman entered, we each took a couple of snorts. Haldeman was my Sherman Adams. I had always felt I could depend on him. We were discussing whether my itinerary for an upcoming trip to the West Coast might include Ely, Nevada, which was the birthplace of Mrs. Nixon,
“That’s perfect,” Haldeman said. “We need anything we can get, PR-wise.”
“But you know something, Bob? It’s all image.”
“Well, that is precisely the purpose of public relations.”
“No, I mean my so-called marriage is all image. Pat and I have not, you know, slept together for many years. My God, I was the President of the Unites States, and I couldn’t even get laid by my own wife.”
“Sir, you don’t really want to talk about this--”
“And I’ll tell you where it started. During the Cuban Crisis in October ’62. Boy, Kennedy sure won a helluva lot of points on that one. And it could’ve been me confronting Khrushchev. I mean a real international shootdown, not just waving my finger at him in Safire’s goddamn makeshift kitchen.”
“That would have been the logical extension of your Russian trip.”
“I tell you, the unspeakable frustration of not being in a position to negotiate that missile thing. I just couldn’t get it up for Pat, plus the pressure of the California campaign was going on then too. And after we lost that election, she started talking about a divorce. We compromised with separate bedrooms.”
Suddenly I stood up, walked around my desk to where Haldeman was sitting, and I ran my hand back and forth across the top of his crewcut. I am not very physically demonstrative, but I had always wanted to do that. Still, this was almost a spontaneous gesture.
“You stuck by me, Bob,” I said while I rubbing his hair. “Finch dropped out, but you . . . “ And I began weeping uncontrollably.
“Sir, is there anything I can do?”
Between sobs I blurted out, “Oh, sure”—I certainly did not intend for this to be taken literally—“Why don’t you try sucking my cock, maybe that’ll help.”
To my utter astonishment, Haldeman unzipped my fly and proceeded with what can only be described as extreme efficiency. The whole thing could not have taken more than five minutes from beginning to end. He must have had some practice during his old prep-school days. Neither of us said a word—before, during or after.
This misunderstanding was comparable to the time that Jeb Magruder remarked how convenient it would be if we could get rid of Jack Anderson, and G. Gordon Liddy assumed that was a direct order and rushed out to accomplish the act. If Liddy had not blabbed his “assignment” to an aide in the corridor, Anderson might not be alive today.
As for my own motivation, here was an experience not of homosexuality but of power. I realized that if I could order the Pentagon to bomb Cambodia, it was of no great consequence that I was now merely permitting my chief of staff to perform fellatio on me. In fact, I was fully cognizant of what an honor it must have been for him.
When the incident was over, I simply returned to my desk, and although the tension of vulnerability was still in the air, we resumed our discussion as if nothing had occurred.
“Now,” I said in a normal tone of voice, “what’s on the agenda?”
“Sir,” Haldeman began, “on this Watergate problem, it would be advantageous to us if any similar activity on the part of the Democrats could be leaked to the media.”
“Well, Hoover once told me—this was right after we won in ’68—he said that within the previous month, LBJ had the FBI put the bug on Agnew and me. Ramsey Clark was attorney general then, but he never authorized it, so that was an illegal wiretap.”
“Perfect. We start with Lyndon Johnson and work our way back.”
“But no, on second thought, the LBJ tap would open up the whole Dragon Lady can of beans. I mean that was the goddamn excuse they had for spying on us.”
Then Haldeman delivered a resounding pep talk—when he lets loose he can be an emotional marvel—about the importance of launching a counterattack against our enemies.
I must say at this point that Rose Mary Woods deserves a Medal of Honor for the way she was willing to humiliate herself by taking full blame for accidentally erasing those first five minutes rather than stand by while my public image was being destroyed.
Moreover, when General Alexander Haig learned from Haldeman’s notes that during those additional thirteen-and-a-quarter-minutes there was a discussion of how to deal with Watergate, thereby proving that I was involved in the cover-up only three days after the break-in, Haig attributed the erasure to “sinister forces.” He said this under oath in Judge John Sirica’s courtroom.
Now that is loyalty above and beyond the call of duty.
*   *   *
In retrospect, I realize that H.R. Haldeman was part of the plot against me all along, always trying to ingratiate himself—anything to impress me, when actually he w as trying to hurt my political career. Not that he was against me personally; I was just his particular assignment as part of an overall plan “to destroy,” in the words of Frank Sturgis, “the office of the presidency.”
Haldeman was a saboteur in the guise of a sycophant. In 1967, when he was a vice president at the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency, he sent me a long memo on how I could use the media in my ’68 campaign. I have since learned that during World War II, various corporations—Standard Oil, Wrigley Chewing Gum, Paramount Pictures—lent their services to the Office of Strategic Services, which later became the CIA. The Thompson Agency supplied Kenneth Hinks to be chief of the OSS planning staff. One of Haldeman’s predecessors, Richard de Rochemont, a vice president of J. Walter Thompson, was offered a position with the Secret Intelligence Branch of the OSS. Another Thompson official, Donald Coster, stayed on with the CIA in South Vietnam from 1959 to 1962.
That’s when Haldeman really latched on to me, in the ’62 campaign. And when we lost, it was Haldeman who persuaded me to make a public fool of myself with that godawful “You won’t have Nixon to kick around any more” press conference. It was Haldeman in 1972 who acted as a double agent and conspired with Dick Tuck to have all those Chinese fortune cookies contain the same message: “What about the Howard Hughes loan?” And it was Haldeman who consciously sabotaged the research on the Hiss chapter in Six Crises.
On one occasion I was meeting with a group of blind veterans in the Oval Office. I wanted to display my empathy with them, so I began describing the Presidential Seal, which was woven into the carpet we happened to be standing on. A blind veteran got down on his knees and started feeling that design with his hands. I closed my eyes and proceeded to do the same. It was perhaps the most spontaneous gesture of my life, although I must admit I was grateful to hear the sound of cameras whirring. I was pleased that this scene of my true humanity was being recorded for posterity. But Haldeman ordered an embargo on that photograph, ostensibly to protect the dignity of my image, because the president should never be seen in a kneeling position.
Even a year after he resigned, there he was, old faithful Bob Haldeman, backstage with me at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. He chided Johnny Cash for that time he refused to sing “Welfare Cadillac” at the White House, and Cash now replied, “Should I do it tonight and dedicate the song to you now that you’re on welfare?”
Haldeman did not appreciate the humor in that. He was too preoccupied with the betrayal of me that he had in mind. He handed me a yellow yo-yo and said, “This will really please the crowd. It’s an official Roy Acuff model.” I put the yo-yo in my pocket. Haldeman did not mention that the string had been loosened at the bottom, so when I was onstage and I flung that yo-yo down, it just stayed there. Once again, Haldeman had transformed the president into an asshole.
It was Haldeman who had urged me to Install the White House taping system. It was Haldeman who hired Alexander Butterfield, who testified to the whole world about the tapes, and told the FBI about E. Howard Hunt. Butterfield brought in Al Wong to set up the system and check it every day. And it was Wong who brought James McCord onto the team. It all seems so obvious now.
One thing about Gerald Ford, though: He keeps his promises—not only to pardon me, but also his promise to fire Alexander Butterfield, even though Ford was actually grateful to him. As for me, I should have listened to L. Patrick Gray when he warned me, “People on your staff are trying to mortally wound you.”
My wife, Pat, has sworn to me that she never told anyone about our marital difficulties, and of course I believe her, so the leak to Woodward and Bernstein could only have come from Haldeman. On top of all his other betrayals, he must have been Deep Throat too.
*   *   *
There was one plan of the White House Plumbers that never came to fruition. It involved the theft of Patricia Ellsberg’s dental records. This was my own idea—not Haldeman’s, not Hunt’s, not Liddy’s—they were satisfied with obtaining the records of Daniel Ellsberg’s psychiatrist.
But I remembered that the first time Alger Hiss confronted Whittaker Chambers, he requested to see his teeth. Hiss explained to me that he suspected Chambers might be someone he had known years before, and he wanted to see his teeth to make sure.
Well, that recollection inspired me. We were able to obtain the dental records of Ellsberg’s wife, all right, but did not have the opportunity to use them in helping to prove that she was guilty of espionage. I could not imagine exactly how we were going to achieve this but I did know that, whatever, it would be accepted by the public simply because the charge itself was so “off the wall.”
How odd that Whittaker Chambers, the dignified translator of Bambi, had been asked to publicly show his teeth as if he were some kind of stud at a horse show. I have never been able to forget that moment.

The paradox of our nation is that we turn our vices into virtues. As the truth about political assassinations—from Malcolm X to Mrs. Dorothy Hunt—finally begins to emerge, we may truthfully say, “Only in America does there exist the freedom to reveal how insidious we have been, and then to continue in our insidious way with an even more determined spirit.”
I still believe that the United States is the greatest country in the world. It is also the greatest show on earth.
I once had a vision of myself leaving Washington the way Jimmy Durante used to end his TV program, standing in a spotlight and bowing gracefully to the audience, then walking back a few steps into another spotlight, bowing again, and so on. Instead, I ended up sounding as helpless as Hal the Computer in the movie 2001, unable to control my own memory banks.
My consolation for this personal tragedy is summed up in Jeane Dixon’s prediction: “Historians yet unborn are going to take the facts, and Richard Nixon will go down as a great President. They’re going to find that the price the world is paying for trying to discredit Nixon is going to be that we’ll practically lose our freedom.”
In the meantime, I am, at long last, completely at peace with myself. It has been worth all the struggle.
Postscript:
After “A Sneak Preview of Richard Nixon’s Memoirs” was published, syndicated columnist Liz Smith—who hadn’t seen that piece—wrote that H.R. Haldeman had been in the Oval Office with Nixon, and that his trousers were down to his ankles. Hoping to smoke out the truth, I retyped one page of the manuscript, inserting a phrase (shown in italics) in this sentence: “When the incident was over, I simply returned to my desk, and although the tension of vulnerability was still in the air and my trousers were still around my ankles, we resumed our discussion as if nothing had occurred.” I then photocopied the manuscript and sent it to Liz Smith.  I had assumed she would check with her source. Instead, she wrote in her column that she had been fooled by me, implying that her source had based that revelation on my article. Somehow my hoax on Liz Smith backfired. I had become a victim of my own satirical prophecy.
In his memoirs, I had Nixon insisting that Watergate was a setup to get rid of him as president. A decade later, Nixon himself made that claim in a network television interview. Furthermore, Haldeman in his book, The Ends of Power, would reveal that Nixon used code words when talking about the murder of President Kennedy. Haldeman said that Nixon always referred to the assassination as “the Bay of Pigs.” And, on May 5, 1977, the Houston Post published a UPI dispatch that stated:
“Watergate burglar Frank Sturgis said Wednesday that the CIA planned the break-in because high officials felt Richard Nixon was becoming too powerful and was overly interested in the assassination of John Kennedy . . . ‘Several times the President asked CIA director Richard Helms for the files on the Kennedy assassination, but Helms refused to give them to him, refused a direct order from the President,’ Sturgis said. ‘I believe Nixon would have uncovered the true facts in the assassination of President Kennedy and that would have taken off the heat in Watergate. Because Nixon wanted files, the CIA felt they had to get rid of him.’ Asked if Nixon ever was in danger, Sturgis replied, ‘Yes, absolutely. Nixon was lucky he wasn’t killed—assassinated like President Kennedy.’”
One other thing.  “A Sneak Preview of Richard Nixon’s Memoir” was originally published in 1976, in which Nixon insisted that Watergate was a set-up to get rid of him as president. About a decade later, Tricky Dick made that exact same claim on a network television interview.
Satirical prophecy in action.


Why I Leaked the Anita Hill Affidavit

I shall identify myself only as a female aide to a Republican senator. It is also relevant that I have long nurtured a keen interest in psycho-history, the process by which a nation’s direction is interpreted as an extension of the psychological makeup of those individuals who govern it.
Without going into specific detail, let me simply state that on October 5, 1991, I happened to hear part of a conversation among Judge—now Supreme Court Justice—Clarence Thomas, Senator Orrin Hatch and Senator Alan Simpson. The three were meeting informally one week after the Judiciary Committee voted, first 7-7, then 13-1, to recommend the confirmation of Judge Thomas, and one day after the full Senate indicated that he would be confirmed.
The conversation I happened to hear had to do with those charges brought by Anita Hill and ignored by the members of the committee, both Democratic and Republican. At that point in time I still thought this was an appropriate response, because the alternative would have been to hold an executive session, and Judge Thomas would then have had no practical choice but to resort to heavy denial. Now, however, these men were, in a jocular fashion, acknowledging the truth of what would turn out to be Professor Hill’s allegations.
Senator Simpson was saying, “Y’know, Clarence, I’ve seen some pretty raunchy porno movies in my time, but I never did see one where a lady was having sex with an animal.”
“I’ll never forget it,” Judge Thomas replied in his riveting sonorous tone. “They were in a barn. Except that the inside of the barn was like a theater.”
Senator Hatch interjected, “Summer stock, eh? No pun intended”
“There was a stage at one end,” Judge Thomas continued his description, “and the stage was facing rows and rows of wooden folding chairs. There were haystacks piled up on the stage, and in front of the haystacks there was a beautiful, buxom, blond woman—and a donkey. Well, the woman began disrobing and she started stroking the donkey to arousal.”
“Doesn’t sound at all sleazy to me,” Senator Simpson said.
“Actually, it had Beethoven piano sonatas playing in the background,” Judge Thomas said. “Well, when the woman was fully disrobed and the donkey was fully aroused, they began copulating, right there in front of those haystacks on the stage of that barn. Slow and sensual. Then bumping and grinding away, accompanied by passionate moans and wild braying. You’ve never seen a sight like this, I promise. And then the camera panned slowly toward the audience . . . and the audience consisted entirely of donkeys.”
The Senate office shook with raucous laughter, especially that of Judge Thomas. His booming guffaws rang like huge gongs in a church belfry. And, I must admit, I had to suppress my own laughter. I had been totally caught by surprise, but I appreciated getting the insight. Homo sapiens is, in reality, the only species that has a need for pornography.
When the group’s laughter finally began to simmer down, Senator Hatch said, “I suppose that movie was one of the demands of the animal rights people.”
“That’s correct,” Senator Simpson added. “Saving animals’ lives is no longer enough. They need culture.”
I felt like I was imprisoned in the boys’ locker room, but I was getting ready to force myself to leave anyway, and it would have ended right there for me if the subject matter hadn’t returned to Anita Hill.
“I’m glad nobody considered calling her to testify against me, even for a closed-door session,” Judge Thomas said. “But you fellas will really love this. Anita Hill was a very opinionated young lady. Actually, she and I once had an extremely animated discussion on the decriminalization of abortion. Can you imagine what the Democrats would’ve done with that?”
And that was the precise instant I made the decision to leak Professor Hill’s statement to the press. Although I have constantly been sexually hassled, I have never really been harassed in the legal sense of the word. However, I have had an abortion, and I was totally outraged by the blatant hypocrisy I’d overheard. I had never leaked a document before, but my anger overshadowed my fear.
I chose Nina Totenberg because I had come to trust her reporting about the Supreme Court on National Public Radio. I honestly had no idea what leaking the affidavit would accomplish. I certainly did not envision that it would literally embarrass the Senate into delaying the vote until public hearings were held, though that probably was my secret desire.
But Judge Thomas testified under oath that he had never discussed the subject of abortion. However, in response to a question by Senator Hank Brown, Professor Hill testified that she had disagreed with Judge Thomas in a discussion about Roe v. Wade. Unfortunately, then-Senator Joseph Biden quickly interrupted her.
“That is not the subject of these hearings,” he said.
Personally, I feel quite disappointed about that particular aspect of the testimony, but I have not the slightest regret over leaking Anita Hill’s affidavit, and I would gladly do it all over again.
I certainly set a higher moral standard for myself than did the staffer for Senator John Danforth who wrote Judge Thomas’s statement that began, “Nobody helped me with this.”


President Clinton’s Private Confession

The following is a leaked transcript of a closed-door, secretly taped prayer breakfast that Bill Clinton hosted for a group of religious leaders after the impeachment trial failed to remove him from office.
#
Gentlemen--and lady (I guess you must be the Episcopalian)—thank you for being here. It’s too bad Reverend Moon isn’t among us this morning, so he could perform a mass impeachment of all the senators who swore under oath that they would be impartial. But seriously, folks, I’d like begin with an epiphany I had yesterday, one that truly humbled me. Strangely enough, it happened while I was watching The Roseanne Show. I had never seen it before, but she was interviewing Paula Jones and, as my mother used to say, curiosity got the best of me.
Ms. Jones was telling Roseanne about the first time she saw me in that hotel. She was working at the courtesy booth for the governors’ conference. She described me as funny-looking, the way my hair was styled, being overweight, how my suit was out of fashion and didn’t fit. So, she was sitting at the registration desk with her girlfriend, pointing at me and giggling. Somehow, I perceived her through the filter of arrogance that people with power develop, and I assumed that she was giving me a come-hither look. That simple misperception is what triggered this whole long ordeal. I took her willingness for granted.
It was different with Monica Lewinsky. I mean to say, she flashed the strap of her thong underwear—it made my heart go thump—and, you know, I’m a prisoner at the White House. I can’t go to a motel, but Monica appeared like a gift from Heaven, and I succumbed to temptation. I was fully cognizant that this was a very delicate situation—I even asked for permission to kiss her—yet I blocked out my foresight. Way back in college, when I tried to avoid military service, I was already thinking ahead to campaigning for president, but now I found myself ignoring the likelihood that Monica would not keep our relationship a secret.
I certainly didn’t consider the possibility that she would become so seriously involved with me. It was embarrassing to hear the tape that Linda Tripp made, where Monica told her what she had said to me on the phone: “I love you, Butthead.” I remember thinking when it happened, “Hey, I’m the president of the United States, you can’t call me Butthead.” However, I immediately decided to treat the situation with humor. But she hung up before I could say, “I love you, Beavis.”
Surprisingly, I was not embarrassed about the infamous cigar incident. I felt that it had been an act of restraint from actual intercourse. Kind of tender and playful. Now, if it had been a Cuban cigar, that would have been illegal. But this was not the sort of intimacy that I would have felt comfortable performing with the First Lady. Hillary and I are really close, but as I’m sure you understand, no cigar.
For her, the most revealing thing in The Starr Report is Monica’s fantasy about our—Monica and me—being together more often when I’ll be out of office; where she quotes me as saying, “I might be alone in three years.” Hillary was furious, not only because it had provided a young intern with false encouragement, but also because it implied that we--Hillary and me--don’t have sex, and she felt it divulged our agreement that if we were to separate, it would not occur before we left the White House.
For me, the most revealing section—in that same section of the report—is Monica’s testimony that I jokingly said, “Well, what are we going to do when I’m seventy-five and I have to pee twenty-five times a day?” True, I did say that, but I really wasn’t joking. In fact, it was my fear of old age that kept drawing me to Monica. She was my direct link to youth. So I was being literal about peeing twenty-five times a day when I’m seventy-five. Hell, I drink at least eight glasses of water a day now—just like I’m supposed to, for my health—but then I have to pee at least eight times a day. Ironically, the TV commercials warn that if you have to pee eight times in 24 hours, it’s a symptom of an overactive bladder.
Indeed, irony has permeated this long-running scandal, beginning to end. It was ironic that my sexual appetite helped put me in office—the Gennifer Flowers allegation originally placed me in the media spotlight—and it was my sexual appetite that almost tossed me out of that same office. And it’s ironic that, although Kathleen Willey enjoyed our brief encounter, to prove it we would have had to resort to obtaining testimony from her confidant, the wonderful Linda Tripp.
Now, there are things that I’ve done as president of which I’m truly ashamed. Even before my inauguration, I made it a point to stop in Arkansas to oversee the execution of a mentally retarded prisoner. At his last meal, he said he’d wait to have his dessert, a slice of pecan pie, until after the execution—that’s how much he understood what was going on. I’m ashamed of under-protecting the rights of gays and over-protecting children from the Internet. I’m ashamed of being against medical marijuana and for requiring a urine test as a prerequisite to obtaining a driver’s license. I’m ashamed of bombing Iraq, Afghanistan and Sudan. I’m ashamed of increasing the military budget and decreasing the welfare budget. I’m ashamed of dropping cluster bombs and continuing to plant land mines.
But the Republicans didn’t dare attack me for any of those positions because they are their positions too.
I’ll tell you how I survived this past year, how I maintained such high approval ratings, while Newt Gingrich fell by the wayside. How I managed, in short, to remain president. It was partly the state of the economy, and it was partly the state of the culture. Pornography is a twenty-billion-dollars-a-year business in this country. Steven Spielberg told me that’s more than Hollywood’s entire domestic box-office receipts. Because it’s what the American public wants. And the TV networks exploit that dirty little secret. It’s why sweeps weeks are always so raunchy. So, then, what I did wasn’t considered such a big deal after all.
Mainly, though, I have survived because, one sunny afternoon, Monica was positioning herself on the carpet under my desk in the Oval Office while I was on the phone with Benjamin Netanyahu. I was telling him about the time that Monica was performing oral sex on me while Yassir Arafat was waiting in the Rose Garden for our appointment. I didn’t tell Netanyahu that she was just about to perform the same act on me while I was on the phone with him. Anyway, at that point, Monica found a big old dusty Mason jar under my desk. There was a label on the side which read, “Property of Ronald Reagan.”
That Mason jar was filled with Teflon, and I have rubbed it on myself every day since.
I began my talk this morning with an epiphany, and I’d like to end with another. This epiphany also occurred while I was watching television—Larry King Live—and, once again, Paula Jones was the guest. At one point she said, “I’ve never voted in my life.” And I was astounded. Then she said, “I’m so apolitical, it’s unreal.” And I realized what an incredibly great country America really is, that somebody who was just a plain citizen, who was never even interested in politics—somebody who had never even voted for a president—had nearly succeeded in toppling one.
Well, this has been a catharsis for me. I just want to say once more how much I appreciate your presence here. And finally I would like to share with you a little witticism that Hillary came up with last night, an idea for what my epitaph should be: “Here lies Bill Clinton, but that depends on what you mean by lies.” Isn’t she wonderful?
Oh, and one more thing. Now listen carefully. I did not have sexual assault with that woman, Ms. Broaddrick. I’ll be honest with you, it may have been rough sex, but it was totally consensual. That, I can guarantee. Thank you and God bless you all.


The Autobiography of Monica Lewinsky

The following is an exclusive excerpt from an autobiography-in-progressy by Monica Lewinsky, titled Going Down in History. The manuscript was leaked to The Realist by, of course, a reliable source.
#
I am not an airhead. I’m a victim, partly of my own making. And mostly, I’m a political pawn of the spin doctors. There are several books being written about the White House scandal, but only a few individuals know what really happened, and only I know who I really am, which is why I have decided to write this book. I would write it even if I didn’t need the money for legal expenses. My life may be ruined—at least my reputation will be forever tainted—but the truth must be told.
I don’t like being a one-dimensional symbol. If anybody were to take a free-association test, the psychiatrist would say “Monica Lewinsky” and the patient would immediately respond “Oral sex.” Maybe soon my name will be in a crossword puzzle—the clue: eight letters across—and the correct word will be “fellatio.”
Back home in Brentwood, I’ve been listening to talk radio a lot. Ronn Owens on KABC had listeners phone in with nothing but jokes about me for a solid hour. First he warned the audience that if they were easily offended, they should tune out. I have never felt so objectified in my life, and yet, at the same time, I found the program quite riveting.
The best call came from a nine-year-old who said, “Bill Clinton violated the Eleventh Commandment: Thou shalt not put thy rod in thy staff.” The worst call came from a man who asked, “What do the Titanic and Monica Lewinsky have in common?” The answer was, “They both have dead seamen (semen) floating in the hull.”
And remember that awful piece of gossip—the one Lucianne Goldberg initiated in order to get attention from the press for her—that I kept a blue dress stained with Clinton’s dried ejaculation as a souvenir? Well, Jonathan Brandmeier on KLSX invited listeners to call in and suggest euphemisms for presidential semen. My favorite was “Bubba butter.” Apparently, my role is to serve as a vehicle for the destruction of taboos.
I have also become an automatic comedy reference. So, to Jay Leno, David Letterman and Conan O’Brien, I’m very useful in punchlines. To Saturday Night Live, I’m just a character in their sketches, and never without that beret from my famous hugging-Bill TV footage. But I did think it was hilarious to cast John Goodman in drag as Linda Tripp. That cheered me up. I’ve been simultaneously depressed, scared and, strangely enough, exhilarated.
As an instant celebrity, I’ve learned that everybody always sees everybody else through their own particular filters. Democrats, Republicans, men, women, the other interns—all perceive me subjectively. For a manufacturer of novelty items, I was simply a disembodied inspiration for the marketing of “Presidential Kneepads.” And for Penthouse magazine, I would only be considered their next notorious masturbation enhancer.
In the eyes of the media—from NBC News to Nightline, from TIME magazine to People, from the New York Times to the National Enquirer, from the Washington Post to Entertainment Tonight—I am purely a commodity. Naturally, I believe in the First Amendment, so I’m against censorship. All I’m saying is that while America is achieving adolescence publicly, the tabloids have won the war.
The battleground is like an ongoing contemporary Shakespearean tragicomedy, but there is no script, there is no producer, there is no director. There is only the process of everyone’s karma interacting. I recall the words of Terence McKenna when he was a guest lecturer at Lewis & Clark. He said, “Chaos is the tail that wags the dog.”
Damage control is the name of the game. It was Dick Morris who advised Clinton to get a dog. Buddy, huh? They should’ve named him Photo-Op. It was also Dick Morris who suggested taping that ostensibly candid scene of the First Couple dancing on the beach. And I would bet my entire book advance that both Hillary and Bill knew ahead of time that Dick Morris was going to release a trial balloon that if the rumor about Hillary being a lesbian were true, then it would be perfectly reasonable that her husband would need to seek sexual gratification elsewhere.
In fact, the reason I think that Clinton’s approval ratings have been so high is because people can identify with him fooling around. I mean, when Jimmy Carter admitted that he had lust in his heart, it was the adultery vote that helped get him elected. And that was only lust in his heart. Bill Clinton is an activist.
I’ve been reading a book, Spin Cycle by Howard Kurtz, and there’s a story in there about that time in 1996 when the president said that he “might like to date” a shapely, 500-year-old mummy whose remains were on display at the National  Geographic Society. Later, chatting after a few cocktails, Press Secretary Mike McCurry told a dozen journalists on the press plane that he could understand Clinton’s remark. “Compared to that mummy he’s been fucking,” McCurry chuckled, “why not?” Poor Hillary.
Without bothering to mention that it was off the record, McCurry assumed his joke wouldn’t be reported, and it wasn’t until that book. Washington is a very cynical place. Everything is stated carefully and deliberately, with the intention that it will be repeated. When McCurry told the Chicago Tribune in an interview that Clinton’s relationship with me could turn out to have been “complicated,” it was no slip of the tongue. He was fully aware that his observation would appear in print.
Unlike Richard Nixon, who never dreamed that his words would be published in a book, Abuse of Power: The New Nixon Oval Office Tapes, edited by Stanley Kutner: “Bob [Haldeman], please get me the names of the Jews, you know, the big Jewish contributors to the Democrats. Could we please investigate some of the cocksuckers?”
My mom is a member of the Book of the Month Club, and in their brochure they printed it “c*cks*ck*rs.” Anyhoo, that’s how everybody thinks of me now. I’m the nation’s official c*cks*ck*r laureate.
The image of me on my knees giving head to the president has become a cultural icon. The irony is that it never happened. When Wolf Blitzer from CNN asked Clinton at a press conference what he would like to say to me, Clinton smiled and said, “That’s good, that’s good”—referring sarcastically to the question—but it was extremely ironic, because that’s exactly what I imagined he did say to me: “That’s good, that’s good.” And I replied, “I gave you a blow job, but I didn’t swallow.” He started laughing hysterically, just like that time he did with Boris Yeltsin. Bill liked my sense of humor. That’s why we went from flirtation to friendship.
However, the reasons I visited the White House thirty-seven times was not for Bill—it was to be with Hillary—she was the one who desired me physically. The rumor about her being a lesbian was true. And so my relationship with Bill was complicated. He just acted as a middle man for Hillary, and now, by denying an affair with me, he’s telling the truth and taking the fall for her. In that sense, he’s an incredibly loyal husband. Despite what the public may think, Bill is absolutely devoted to Hillary.
Everybody is watching so closely for him to commit the next indiscretion, but it would have to be with somebody he can totally trust, somebody who could suck the leader of the Western World’s dick and not confide in a friend, or to somebody who pretended to be a friend. So, for a while, Bill is left with only Buddy’s tongue for sexual companionship. At least, Buddy won’t lick and tell. And if I know my president, while Buddy is pleasuring him, Clinton will fantasize that it’s a female dog.


Sarah Palin’s Reality Sitcom

Referring to the Ronald Reagan presidency, Neal Gabler has written about “the triumph of entertainment over political ideology of any sort.” And Kurt Andersen labeled Bill Clinton the “Entertainer-in-Chief.” The voters are the audience, conditioned to fear and superficiality in commercials for erectile dysfunction and political campaigns alike, both having scary side effects. And now the injection of Sarah Palin and her family into the McCain vs. Obama campaign makes one wonder whether the winner of this race will ultimately depend on which candidate presents the better sitcom. It already is a reality show. Do you know what the difference is between a sitcom and a reality show? The laugh track. Otherwise, how would the masses be able to tell whether something is funny or not? Hmmmmm . . . In any case, we’re pleased to present the pilot episode of:
BRIDGES TO NOWHERE
[Instrumental rockabilly music accompanies a montage of Sarah Palin in various contexts, as the opening credits are superimposed on these images: In a helicopter, using a machine-gun to shoot a wolf running away in the snow. As a contestant in the Miss Alaska competition. A wedding photo. Burning a pile of books. Jumping high to block a shot in a basketball game. Seated at her desk in the governor’s office. At a barbecue with her children. Giving a speech to a large crowd. At the bank, exchanging a wolf’s left foreleg for a $150 bounty. Tossing her hat way up in the air and then shooting it down with a rifle.]
[Sarah and Todd are slumped down on the living-room sofa.]
SARAH: I’m exhausted and exhilarated at the same time. I was at the Learning Annex all day, taking that course in “How to Be a Vice President.”
TODD: And I was interviewing potential nannies all day. No one fits the bill yet. But I just keep calling the agency. Maybe I’ll try Craigslist.
[The telephone rings. Todd picks it up.]
TODD: Hello . . . thanks, I will. [Hangs up the phone and clicks on the TV.] That was McCain. [Looks at TV Guide for the channel number and clicks the TV on.]  Keith Olbermann is doing a Special Comment about you on MSNBC. 
OLBERMANN: When John McCain first selected Sarah Palin as his running mate, it seemed to me that it was the best “What were you thinking?” moment since Hugh Grant got caught getting oral sex from a prostitute in his rental car. I was sure that with Governor Palin as the ambush candidate, Senator McCain would be ridiculed into a severe case of buyer’s remorse, his impulsive choice would backfire, and there would then be an epidemic of schaedenfreude among Democats. But I must admit, Ms. Palin, you have, dare I say, a certain Machiavellian charisma, and I was not quite prepared for that. You said that you deliberately tried to make yourself look frumpy, what with those Kawasaki eyeglasses and that chocolate-rust cotton-candy hair-do, sort of like the secretary in a porn movie who takes off her glasses and shakes her hair loose, then she goes ahead and seduces her uptight boss right there on his own black leather executive chair. Or so the comedians tell me, I wouldn’t know. But you might as well be the star of a porn movie, because your main qualification to be vice president is that you have a vagina and you are a cunt. Allow me to parse that for you, Sarah. When I say that you were appointed because you have a vagina, there is no way in semantic purgatory that McCain would have chosen a man who had exactly the same political positions and experience as you--except that your American flag pin is bigger--so his having a penis would simply not make one iota of difference. And, you’re a cunt if for no other reason than, in your acceptance speech, using Barack Obama as a prototype, you demeaned countless dedicated and courageous community organizers across the nation by pretending that, as mayor, you exercised actual responsibilities which ostensibly they don’t have. And I am not being sexist here, Sarah, because I am also calling John McCain a prick, if only because he is against funding higher education for our young men and women who are fighting and being maimed and dying in Iraq and Afghanistan--McCain’s pathetic rationale being that if they had that funding to look forward to, then they just might prefer to come home and go to college rather than re-enlist. So, you-the-cunt and he-the-prick have a very complementary relationship. Support our troops, indeed! McCain’s idea of supporting the troops is to send them more antidepressants--one out of every eight is already on them--so they can go kick down doors and kill people but still feel good about it. Oh, yes, and Sarah, we must not forget how Cindy McCain described the basis of your foreign policy experience. She said, “Alaska is the closest part of our country to Russia.” With allies like that, you don’t need opponents. Cindy reminds me of Jessica Simpson, when she asked if a can of “Chicken of the Sea” was fish or chicken. What’s next, Cindy will sing her own rendition of Rosemary Clooney’s classic song, “C’monna My Houses”?  And speaking of rendition, Sarah, I wonder what you think of the CIA flying prisoners to other continents where they are tortured. Hey, what ever happened to Country First?--they should be tortured in this country--yes, this country that is so incredibly endangered by the Unholy Trinity of corrupt government, welfare corporations and evangelical religion. Incidentally, Sarah, wouldn’t you agree that Rush Limbaugh--infamous hater of the “feminazis”--was a sexist when he boasted, “We’re the ones with a babe on the ticket!” Inquiring minds want to know. Likewise, wouldn’t you agree that McCain was a sexist when he was asked a question about Hillary Clinton during the primaries--“How do we beat the bitch?”--and he replied, “Excellent question.” And wasn’t it sexist of him to vote against equal pay for women? Just remember, Sarah, the only thing that John McCain wants more than to live in the White House is to have a menage a’ trois with you and Cindy. Good night and good luck.
[Todd clicks the TV off.]
SARAH: I’ll tell you something, Todd. I feel like a human dartboard for the media, but I’m developing a thick skin.  
TODD: I know what you mean. I say, “Oh, yeah, media?  [Clutching his crotch]  Troopergate this!”
SARAH: And you know what, the campaign spinners who feed the media are just as bad. They’re like the airport security people, who have to spend all day looking at a screen in order to focus on potential threats in the shape of a gun or a knife or a hand grenade. Both campaigns--they have to focus on each other’s opponents in desperate search of anything that can be deliberately misinterpreted to distract all the dumbed-down voters from the real issues like national security. At first, I thought that was the name of a bank. “Hurry up and invest your money at the National Security Bank--before they fail!”  [Sarah and Todd start laughing hysterically.] And what about earmarks? Why, they’re just political hickies....

[Piper is sitting on a rocking chair in her bedroom, with Trig on her lap, holding a bottle to his mouth with one hand, and continually licking her other hand in order to leave a saliva deposit, then smoothing down Trig’s hair.]
PIPER: Come on now, Trig, I want you to drink your moose’n’banana shake. It tastes so delicious. And it’s good for you too, even if the plastic bottle has poison lead in it because it’s from China or somewhere. Listen, I’m sorry that you were like a circus prop at the convention. People screaming all over the place. But it’s lucky they gave you a watchamacallit, a sedative so you could sleep through all that noise. And you didn’t even know that you were being passed around like a marijuana joint, huh? It’s legal here in Alaska. Did you know that? But it has to be only one ounce or less. And then you have to smoke it in your own house. I’m gonna wait till I’m thirteen before I try it. Bristol and Levi smoke it when Mommy’s out making a speech. If she was here, she’d smell it right away, so then they have to go somewhere else. Mommy says, “Pot may be part of God’s plan, but not in this house.”  She’s always saying that something is part of God’s plan, but I don’t understand what she means about that. Are hurricanes and train crashes part of God’s plan too? Anyhow, you’re not supposed to smoke anything when you’re pregnant, right? Hey, Trig, you wanna hear what I think would be a nice name for Bristol’s baby? Diversion. I didn’t think of that by myself. I heard my teacher tell another teacher that Mommy’s baby is a diversion. I think it could be for either a boy or a girl. Hey, my tongue is dry. I don’t have any watchamacallit, any salvia left. Maybe if I just have a little sip of your moose’n’banana shake. [Drinks from bottle] It’s really yummy...

[Track is riding a stationery bike in his room while talking with Willow.]
TRACK: I’m telling you, those Iraq Veterans Against the War were real traitors at the Democratic convention. I learned that they had the nerve to be in full uniform, and they were chanting, “My buddy’s in the foxhole with a bullet in his head--I called to get the medic but he’s already dead.” But at our convention, just like the war in Iraq was a justifiable pre-emptive strike, so was the raid on the protesters before the convention began.
WILLOW: What happened?  I was busy taking care of Trig.
TRACK: The police and the sheriff’s department seized material that could’ve been used to barricade roads, and spikes that could disable the delegates’ buses. They confiscated slingshots and buckets of gray water and urine. It’s better to prevent using that stuff before it happens. They busted four people on suspicion of conspiracy to commit a riot, and detained dozens of others. They took boxes of pamphlets on free-speech laws in Minnesota, and booklets on how to protest legally.
WILLOW: That doesn’t seem right. I was listening to the radio, and a pundint was talking --
TRACK: You mean pundit--
WILLOW: --a pundit, he was talking about keeping protesters out of sight, they could only speak on P.A. systems in fenced-off, like cages, on side streets, and I thought they were talking about the Olympics in China, but then I realized that they were actually talking about the protesters at our conventions.
TRACK: It’s not the same.  China is a Commie dictatorship--and here there were seventy-seven applications to speak--but not one single protester was given permission, and all those who applied were arrested before the games began. Way to go.
WILLOW: I heard that in St. Paul, even a mime got a permit to speak. And the people who did speak couldn’t be heard. I mean, what about the First Amendment? We learned about that in school.
TRACK: Yeah, well, it doesn’t apply to those anarchists on the opening day, with black cloth covering their faces, a few hundred of them, running around the streets, setting fires, throwing rocks, breaking windows, blocking traffic. It was the duty of the riot squad and the National Guard to stop those actions. Tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, concussion grenades, whatever it took.
WILLOW: But what about the peaceful demonstrators?
TRACK: There were ten thousand demonstrators who were peaceful, and they were allowed to march against the war. All they had to do was follow the rules.  When their permit expired at 5 p.m., they still tried to march to the convention center, but the authorities had already blocked a couple of the bridges that led to the convention center. They blocked ’em with snowplows and gravel trucks, police barricades and plenty of manpower. I saw the protesters running toward one of those bridges, and they were being chased by police in riot gear and teargas masks, so then the protesters were stuck in the middle.  Isn’t that great?  
WILLOW: Ha-ha, the bridges to nowhere. [Track and Willow giggle wildly.] Y’know, I’m really gonna miss you when you go to Iraq.
TRACK: I’m gonna miss you too.  Anyway, the thing is, our guys had to be prepared, starting months before the convention, because there’s all kinds of front organizations out there that the FBI had to get infiltrated, like the environmentalists and vegetarians who pretend to be just innocent special-interest groups. Same with farmers, attorneys, medics, reporters--a journalist, Amy Goodman and her producers, plus a guy from Associated Press on the sidewalk in front of a building where there was a huge party given by lobbyists for legislators with a band, Hookers and Blow, not to be confused with a terrorist band, Rage Against the Machine, and also a bunch of bloggers and a whole video collective called I-Witness--some people had to be roughed-up and handcuffed and arrested for trying to interfere with law enforcement. Their computers and laptops and cameras and journals and diaries were seized. In some locations, even children had assault rifles pointed at their faces. In the military, this is all known as “anticipatory self-defense.”
WILLOW: That’s wicked.  So tell me, are you nervous about going to Iraq?
TRACK: [Stops pedaling and pulls up the left leg of his sweatpants, revealing a tattoo of Christ on his calf.] Not as long as He’s with me, and He will be, every moment, day and night.
WILLOW: [Bends down and kisses the tattoo] I really love Jesus. Whenever I close my eyes and pray, I don’t know what God looks like, but I always think of Jesus, because I know what He looks like....

[Bristol and Levi are sitting on the living-room sofa, holding hands.  He is wearing a T-shirt that says “Billabong.”]
BRISTOL: Here it is Friday night, and we can’t even go out anywhere, because everybody points at us and stares at us and talks about us. It makes me feel like a real freak.
LEVI: How do you think I feel? All I ever wanted to do is play hockey and hang out with the guys and party like mad and get stoned out of my gourd and just chill out. I don’t give a shit about politics. If we didn’t get drunk and screw in the tent outside that party, I never woulda had to go to that fuckin’ Republican convention with your parents, who hate my ass off but they pretend we’re one big happy family.
BRISTOL: Oh, c’mon, if my mother gets elected--like I wasn’t planning to live in Washington, D.C.-- but it’ll be fun. Please, don’t be such a grouch. 
LEVI: You saw my MySpace page. I mean everybody’s seen it.  “I’m a fuckin’ redneck who likes to snowboard and ride dirt bikes.” I’m too young to get married. I’m trapped. I was just minding my own business, and suddenly my whole fuckin’ life is destroyed.
BRISTOL: Look, I don’t wanna argue with you any more. Let’s just see what’s on TV.
[Levi reaches for the remote control and clicks on the TV.]
DAVID LETTERMAN: Here’s good news, ladies and gentlemen.  The Palin family crisis has been solved now, and today the baby is being adopted by Angelina Jolie.
LEVI: Boy, I sure wish that was true. I never wanted to have kids.
BRISTOL: Please, this is not exactly a picnic for me. Let’s just see what else is on.
[Click!]
JAY LENO: Governor Palin announced that her seventeen-year-old unmarried daughter is five months pregnant. And you thought John Edwards was in trouble before. Now he’s really done it.
[Click!]
CONAN O’BRIEN: Sarah Palin said, “We should never have introduced her to John Edwards.”
[Click!]
CRAIG FERGUSON: I don’t think that a young lady getting pregnant should even be news. Unless John Edwards is the father. Then that is kinda news.
[Click!]
BILL MAHER: Palin has five children including an infant that has Downs syndrome. She had it when she was forty-three years old. And it looks a lot like John Edwards.
[Levi reaches for the remote control and clicks off the TV.]
LEVI: That’s really great, Bristol. John Edwards fucked you and your mother . . .

[Sarah is sitting at her computer when there is a knock on her office door.]
SARAH: Come in. [Willow opens the door, walks in and sits down.]  I’m just looking over my stump speech here. It keeps changing.
WILLOW: Mom, I have to talk to you.
SARAH: Yes, dear, what’s on your mind?
WILLOW: [Pausing] I’m . . . pregnant.
SARAH: Very funny.
WILLOW: Mom, I’m not kidding.
SARAH: Willow, you’re only fourteen years old! How could you be pregnant? Are you sure?
WILLOW: I did the test three different times. They all said “Positive.”  I can feel changes in my body.
SARAH: This is horrible. I mean wonderful, of course. God always has a plan. Who’s the father?
WILLOW: [Pausing] It’s . . . Track.
SARAH: What! How can that be? He’s your brother! You had sex with your brother?!
WILLOW: I still don’t understand how I got pregnant. He borrowed a condom from Dad’s sock drawer.
SARAH: I’m shocked beyond belief. When did this happen?
WILLOW: Let’s see, the first time was--
SARAH: The first time! Did he force himself on you?
WILLOW: Well, not really. It was voluntary.
SARAH: Oh my God!  What are we gonna do?  Oh my God!  I’m hysterical!  Oh my God!

[Todd is finishing up an interview with a beautiful young woman in his office. He tries unsuccessfully to avert his eyes from her cleavage.]
TODD: Well, your resume’ is solid--I’m totally impressed with your experience as a nanny--you have excellent references, you have a very enthusiastic personality, and I must admit, of all the women I’ve been interviewing, you’re not only the most qualified, you’re also the most attractive, if you don’t mind my saying so.
NANNY: Oh, I don’t mind at all, Mr. Palin. As a matter of fact, the feeling is mutual.
TODD: Please, call me Todd.
NANNY: Todd. Such a nice masculine name. [Standing] When would you like me to start?
TODD: I’ll have to figure that out with Sarah when she returns.  [Standing]  She’s meeting with Senator McCain today.  
NANNY: [Slowly moving toward him] Then just be sure to call me whenever you know.
TODD: [Slowly moving toward her] All right, I will.
NANNY: You have my number.
TODD: And you have my number.
NANNY: I certainly do.
TODD: [They are standing just a few inches from each other.] The kids are really gonna love you.  [Gradually they embrace, He moves to kiss her on the cheek. She turns her head so that their lips touch, leading to a passionate kiss.]
NANNY: [Mumbling between kisses] I feel like Jude Law’s babysitter.
TODD: [Mumbling between kisses] Who’s Jude Law?
NANNY: [Unbuttoning his shirt] He’s a British actor who made love with his girlfriend Sienna Miller’s babysitter on the billiards table.
TODD: [Unbuttoning her blouse] I don’t have a billiards table, but I do have a cue-stick.
NANNY: [Unbuckling his belt] Oh, I know you do, I can feel it . . .

[Sarah is pacing back and forth at her meeting with John McCain.]
McCAIN: Calm down, Sarah, have a seat, take it easy.
SARAH: [Sitting down] I’m still in a state of shock. My heart is beating so fast. I have terminal dry mouth. This is awful.
McCAIN: Let’s review the situation. Your seventeen-year-old daughter is pregnant. And your nineteen-year-old son is the father. It was consensual sex. Nevertheless, that’s statutory rape. I think we have only two options. One, she gets an abortion.
SARAH: I’m sorry, that’s off the table. I mean it’s out of the question.
McCAIN: Look, I realize that you’re against abortion based on your religious principles, even in the case of rape or incest. And in this case it’s both. But you’re not against abortion if the life of the mother is endangered. That could be our exit strategy. There’s a blind doctor in Washington who performs the safest possible abortion, and he wouldn’t even know who the patient is.
SARAH: Absolutely not. Here’s what I thought about on the plane. Of course, we will never identify Track as the father--I’m so angry I found myself hoping that he would get killed in Iraq, and that would be perceived as such a heartbreaking patriotic sacrifice--I wanted to offer a bounty for the delivery of Track's severed left calf with the Jesus tattoo, and yet I don’t want him to be indicted and sent to prison for who knows how many years. What we can do is to place the full blame on a stranger who was wearing a stocking over his face so that there will be no description except for that detail. Willow didn’t report it because she didn’t have enough cash to pay for a rape kit, and she felt afraid to tell me until she was sure that she was pregnant. But she will be giving birth to that baby. And when Track returns home from Iraq, he will help raise that child, pretending he’s only the uncle, which he actually will be. We could even announce Willow’s pregnancy as an October surprise. That would endear our Christian conservative base to us even more than now, and it could provide a surge--excuse the expression--to our popularity.  
McCAIN: Just because it worked in Bristol’s case, that doesn’t mean it will also work in Willow’s case. I hadn’t quite considered an announcement like this as a possible October surprise. I thought we might capture Osama bin Laden. Or that there could be impeachment and conviction of Bush and Cheney, but it would leave Nancy Pelosi as the new president, and we surely don’t want that. Maybe Obama would be assassinated, then there would be rioting all over the country, there would be martial law, the election would be canceled, and the Bush administration would remain in power. Or the October surprise could be dropping bombs on Pakistan. Or an air strike on Iran. Even if Israel did that, it would be with U.S. aid and approval. Also, there’s a scenario floating around that Joe Biden will drop out of the race in deference to Hillary as Obama’s vice-presidential running mate replacing Biden. That would really ruin our chances of winning.
PALIN: So tell me what the second option is.
McCAIN: That you drop out of the race. It’s the honorable thing to do.
PALIN: What are you gonna do, kick me off the island? Let’s face it, John, if I dropped out, you’d lose the election for sure, and you know it. You need to show me off during this campaign. I’m your biggest asset. I wanted to go on my own Palin Talk Express tour, but no, your neocon friends--they discovered me a year before you and I met--and now they’re so afraid I can’t function without their guidance. They’re like a mad beehive, spouting campaign buzz words at me. But I will never drop out of this race. I would sooner give to the media my tape of our one-night stand in my hotel room at the governors’ conference last February.
McCAIN: If you were to do that, I would release my tape of this whole conversation. So we’re just canceling each other out with such tactics. But that’s what I like about you. You’re such a feisty lady. Y’know, Sarah, if we get elected, I was hoping that our little tryst in Washington could happen again, perhaps this time in the Oval Office.
PALIN: Thanks but no thanks.
McCAIN: I remember you were so pregnant then.
PALIN: And I remember exactly what you said. “Let me baptize your fetus with some maverick juice.” How romantic. But you were lucky I was already pregnant, because it would not have happened otherwise, since, as you know, I’m against birth control. Raising children is performing a task that is from God. And I believe that life begins before conception.
McCAIN: You and the Bush administration. They also consider birth control to be a form of abortion. The Health and Human Services Department is secretly trying to redefine contraception--the Pill, IUDs, you name it—redefine as abortion. So this federal agency could eliminate many state laws. Pharmacists could refuse to supply women with birth control devices. Insurance companies wouldn’t cover contraception. Rape victims wouldn’t have access to the morning-after pill. You have your beliefs and I respect them, but I’m trying to distance myself from George Bush.
PALIN: Except for his speechwriters.
McCAIN: Oh, you’re referring to Matthew Scully and your acceptance speech at the convention. He’s great. By the way, he asked me to pass on a line to you for the stump speech when you’re talking about Obama: “Charlie Manson was a community organizer!”
PALIN: That will definitely get a good response.  We need as many applause lines as we can muster up. Maybe every sentence should get a reaction. Clapping, laughter, cheers. The audiences always get off on that. They feel high and they associate it with us.
McCAIN: Fine, at least we’re back on the same page again. Now promise that if you do become vice president you won’t arrange for me to be killed by the grace of your powerful buddies in Alaska so that you can then become president.
PALIN: Okay, I promise not to have you killed--unless you decide to run for a second term. [They both chortle nervously.]

[The TV set is on, but nobody is watching. A commercial is playing.]
VOICEOVER BY ALEC BALDWIN: [Images of Sarah Palin waving to huge, screaming crowds, signing autographs and being surrounded by paparazzi.] She’s the biggest celebrity in the world. [Video footage of Michael Jackson and Michael Richards are superimposed as if they are in the company of Sarah.] But is she ready to lead? John McCain knows full well she isn’t. With the energy shortage looming, McCain says no to windmills and solar power. And with the economic crisis already upon us, McCain says he’ll cut taxes by lowering payments for Social Security and Medicare. More suffering, increased drilling. That’s the real McCain.
[The face of Joe Biden fills the screen.}
VOICEOVER BY JOE BIDEN: I’m Joe Biden and I approve this message. Let me just add that when one of John McCain’s top economic advisers, former Senator Phil Gramm, was quoted that the United States was only in a “mental recession” and had become “a nation of whiners,” he unintentionally revealed the massive disconnect between the citizens of this country and their representatives . . .
[A few minutes later, Biden is still talking, when Nanny walks into the room, cellphone to her ear, and shuts off the TV.]
NANNY: Yes, hello. Is this the National Enquirer? . . . Oh, good. I’d like to speak to a reporter, please . . . Thank you, I’ll hold . . .
[A split screen shows Nanny and the Reporter on split screens.]
REPORTER: Hello, what can I do for you?
NANNY: Yes, hello, I have a story that you might be interested in. I’ve been having an affair with, you know, the First Dude, and now it seems that I’m pregnant. What would the Enquirer pay for my story?
REPORTER: Do you have any proof that he’s the father?
NANNY: Actually, yes, I do have evidence--DNA, physical evidence, like in CSI--I saved what was left of his semen in the condoms.
REPORTER: But then how could you be pregnant?
NANNY: He told me that his wife makes tiny pinholes in the reservoir tips of his condoms [in Sarah’s voice] “in order to give all those teeny little spermies a fighting chance.”
REPORTER: Why doesn’t he just get a vasectomy?
NANNY: Sarah says that would be like cheating God . . .

                    SUBCULTURES





And Whose Little Monkey Are You?

Sometimes I think I’m dreaming when I read the news. But there are places where the inhabitants have never seen a magazine or a newspaper, and it is simply not a part of their psyche to dream about lines of type. In a spurt of generosity, the United States shipped surplus battery-operated TV sets across the sea to one group of islands in the Pacific Ocean, so that those natives could pass directly from a preliterate society to a post-literate society without having to read a single book in the process.
They watched in amazement as so-called psychic Uri Geller bent forks on the Merv Griffin show. The strange thing was that even though Geller accomplished this feat by trickery, there were young children back in America who hadn’t yet been taught about the self-fulfilling rules of 20th Century physics, and to their parents’ dismay, they were able to bend various kitchen utensils by means of sheer will power.
*   *   *
As more and more deadly conflicts around the world continue to escalate, more and more people are saying, “Boy, the shit’s really gonna hit the fan now.” That phrase, incidentally, did not come into the language until after there was electricity. People say that they are not referring to a lovely Japanese lithograph showing a kimono-clad woman whose long shiny black hair is twisted up into a bun, and who is coquettishly providing her own personal breeze with a colorful rice-paper fan. Then splat!—right in her porcelain-like face. So, no, it has to be an electric fan, which revolves so fast it protects you from the shit—or spreads it, depending which side you’re on—or what’s a fan for?
Meanwhile, even as all that shit is hitting all those fans, the laxative industry continues to blossom. New brand names are constantly competing in the open marketplace. Ex-Lax has even come out with a “milder” version for women—certainly an indication of rampant male chauvinism in their Research & Development section. What’s the implication of this trend? Do females have different digestive systems than males? Is it perfectly acceptable for macho men to have chocolate-covered sandpaper coursing through their intestinal  tracts?
And yet credit must also be given to those friendly folks at Ex-Lax. They were the very first sponsor on television to include a sign-language translation of a commercial—a long-overdue service for the constipated hearing-impaired. Indeed, this had been an early demand of the Deaf Liberation Front. You’ve probably seen their frontline members on the street and in airports, selling little cards with the sign-language alphabet. Some have been getting arrested for being deaf without a license. Naturally, the police recite their Miranda rights, shouting, “You have the right to remain silent!”
Anyway, this particular Ex-Lax commercial features a pleasant, matronly woman reminiscing through her family photo album while a young fellow in the corner of the screen ostensibly translates the message into sign language. Actually, he can say whatever he wants. Nobody monitors his translation. He can indulge in private jokes for all the deaf viewers and only they will know.
The matronly woman in the Ex-Lax commercial says: “Thank God my family is normal.” The young fellow shifts the emphasis slightly in his translation: “Thank God her family is normal.” She continues: “Of course, once in a while somebody in our family will be troubled by irregularity.” He translates: “No shit.” She concludes: “So then we do what we’ve done in our family for generations—we turn to an old friend, Ex-Lax.” He translates: “Jimmy Hoffa knows too much.”
And while the hearing-impaired at home giggle at this mistranslation, all over the globe the shit continues to hit the fans.
*   *   *
These are rough times, but it’s extremely important to develop a sense of optimism. The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists periodically updates a clock on their cover to indicate how close we’re moving toward nuclear war. Recently they moved it from four minutes to midnight to three minutes to midnight, with midnight representing total annihilation. I don’t know exactly what their time scale is—whether one minute represents a month or a year or a decade—but, whichever, they’re saying that we are all now only three minutes away from the ultimate holocaust.
That’s the bad news.
The good news is that atomic scientists are just as fucked-up as the rest of us. They overeat, they forget to floss, they don’t have time for serial orgasms, or they suffer from premature ejaculations, and they set their clocks fifteen minutes ahead so that if they need to mail a letter by six o’clock and their clock says it’s ten after six, it means they still have five minutes to get to the mailbox. So that clock on the cover of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists is fifteen minutes fast. We don’t have just three minutes till doomsday; we have eighteen minutes.

Life remains peaceful on a certain island off the coast of Japan. Here, humans and animals live in peace and harmony.
There are monkeys who for eons have subsisted entirely on sweet potatoes. They would pick the sweet potatoes right out of the dirt in which they grow—eating them, dirt and all. This is the way they have always done it. But one day, for whatever mysterious reason, an individual young female monkey carried her sweet potato to the shore, washed the dirt off in the ocean and proceeded to eat the sweet potato.
Who knows why it was this particular monkey? Any explanation will suffice. Maybe she was an Aries, with a strong pioneer spirit. At any rate, once this monkey broke the ice, other monkeys began to wash the dirt off their sweet potatoes before they ate them. But only the young monkeys.
It was not until the 100th young monkey had washed the dirt off a sweet potato in the ocean--not exactly the 100th; it could’ve been the 93rd or the 108th; the 100th monkey is merely a metaphor for reaching critical mass—but not until then did the first adult monkey wash the dirt off a sweet potato. This was a case of reverse generational influence.
And then other adult monkeys started to imitate this behavior. Washing the dirt off sweet potatoes even began to occur on adjoining islands, indicating that there was some kind of psychic communication in the air.
Now, how can this living New Age parable be applied to human behavior? Well, whatever you do personally to help further the cause of justice and the pursuit of ecstasy, even though you might get discouraged, you must always remember that you might be the one who turns the tide—you have to act as though you are the 100th monkey—and this gives us reason to hope.
That’s the good news.
The bad news is, those monkeys needed that dirt in their diet for roughage. So now there were all these monkeys on this island who weren’t able to shit.
But it just so happened that this was one of the islands where we shipped our surplus TV sets. Across the island, monkeys were gathered around those TV sets, all watching a program that was sponsored by Ex-Lax. Moreover, here was that commercial with the sign-language translation. And, fortuitously enough, these monkeys had relatives trained at Stanford University, where they learned how to communicate in sign language, and had been returned to the island to teach others of their species how to sign.
That’s the good news.
The bad news is that this was the Ex-Lax commercial where the brand name of the product was not translated. The message in sign language was “Jimmy Hoffa knows too much.” These monkeys—serving as shock troops of the Deaf Liberation Front—took that private joke to be their marching orders. So, even though you may have heard the propaganda that Hoffa was killed because he was prepared to speak out about the alliance between military intelligence and organized crime, the truth is that he was eaten to death by hordes of constipated monkeys.
The good news is, they washed the dirt off him first.
*   *   *
It is several years later now. Things have returned to normalcy.
The monkeys on those islands off the coast of Japan still watch TV, but they no longer wash the dirt off their sweet potatoes, and they are just as regular in their defecation as they used to be.
But in America, those children who once bent kitchen utensils to the dismay of their parents have grown up. One such young man now works on the assembly line in a missile factory, and he is able to bend certain working parts out of shape through the use of sheer will power. Soon others will follow suit. Already the intelligence agencies are training their operatives in methods to counteract this kind of psychic sabotage.
The Mime and the Pacer

I found myself walking around and around in a counter-clockwise circle on the stage of the Wallenboyd Theater in downtown Los Angeles, just as a young man known as the Pacer does for several hours every day, always in the same direction, at the exact same spot in the mididle of the boardwalk in Venice Beach. He is an inspiration to me and I sometimes talk about him in my performances.
The boardwalk in Venice is both literally and figuratively on the edge of this country. T-shirts are the hieroglyphics of our time. Here, a grungy wino, who needed a shave long before Don Johnson made stubble fashionable, is wearing a T-shirt that says “Yes, I Am a Model.” There, a nerdy tourist is trying not to let the pizza drip on his T-shirt that says “I Choked Linda Lovelace” (the porn star of Deep Throat).
The boardwalk resembles one of those double-page-spread montages in a children’s book showing many different modes of transportation being used simultaneously. Airplanes fly by, trailing printed messages such as “The New Dating Game Wants You,” and “Scientology, Give Us Our Money Back,” while below, roller-skaters and skate-boarders mingle with cops riding bicycles and Hare Krishnas preparing for their annual parade featuring an elephant nourished entirely on trail mix.
A lone Jesus freak walks along and yells at them—“Antichrist! Antichrist! Antichrist!”—trying to drown out their chant. “Repent, Krishna! People are starving in India every day because these foolish Krishnas refuse to eat the cow! Eat the cow and believe in Jesus Christ! Repent, Krishna!”
You can buy all types of stuff along the boardwalk—rainbow sunglasses and fake Rolex watches and falafel-shaped yo-yo’s. “But,” complains a flower vendor who pays $600 a month for a ten-by-two-foot space, “rent will be going up to $800 and then to $1200 by summer. Venice will eventually be inhabited by a bunch of wealthy lot owners and a population of slaves who work for them.”
However, the performers pay no rent, dependent on voluntary donations. There is a poet who speaks professional gibberish; an artist who draws on the ground with colored chalk; a fellow who juggles an electric chainsaw, a bowling ball, and an apple, for which strangers put money in his hat because they’re grateful to God that they don’t have to do such a bizarre thing to earn a living.
There is a woman who plays the violin while standing on her head. And a man who has a table covered with wine glasses of different sizes filled to varying heights with water, and he plays this musical instrument by rubbing his fingers around the tops of those wine glasses. Audiences gather spontaneously to here his rendition of a Mozart sonata or a ragtime melody or the theme from Chariots of Fire.
There are breakdancers who bring their own personal linoleum-floor sections, and a jogger who jumps hurdles over the endless row of garbage cans lined along the boardwalk. He has to avoid one garbage can because a homeless person is foraging for lunch.
If I had to choose my favorite moment on the boardwalk, it would have to be the time a Rastafarian yogi was standing on the very top of a wooden chair, preparing to jump barefoot onto a pile of freshly broken bottles. “This is serious shit,” he reminded the large semicircle of onlookers. And then, during the anticipatory silence, along came that Jesus freak. Upon seeing this crowd, he edged his way in. Now the Rastafarian yogi was poised upon that unseen edge between “Look before you leap” and “He who hesitates is lost.” Suddenly the Jesus freak called out, “Hey, wait, before you commit suicide there, how do you feel about abortion?”
*   *   *
In front of the Sidewalk Café on the boardwalk, the Mime, a black man wearing white gloves along with a tuxedo and top hat, just stands still—often for hours. He is listening to a stereo headset. One might think he was playing music to counteract the boredom, but it’s really a tape loop reminding him, “Don’t move, stay still, it doesn’t matter if your back itches, people are paying you not to scratch . . . ”
Passersby do indeed put cash in the cardboard box at his feet after they have gaped at him long enough to get their money’s worth. Standing still is his job. People pay him not to move. When he goes to the Unemployment office, a clerk asks, “Did you look for work this week?” He answers simply, “Yes, I stood on the corner of Hollywood and Vine, and then I stood on the corner of Beverly Boulevard and Sierra Bonita, and then I stood . . . ”
In contrast to the Mime is the Pacer, who intrigues me most. He doesn’t call himself the Pacer. He may not even know that others do. But the circle he walks around and around in is his turf. Even an occasional police car respects the force field he creates, and the cops drive around him.
Obviously he originally started this strange stint as a matter of choice. “I think I’ll walk around in circles on the boardwalk today.” And the next day. And the next. But somewhere along the way, walking around in circles became a compulsion, and it started doing him. When you play a role long enough, the role can begin to play you if you’re not careful.
I’ve been out at six o’clock in the morning and there was the Pacer walking in circles. I’ve been out at six o’clock in the evening and there was the Pacer walking in circles. He does stop to eat—which indicates that at some level he is still acting voluntarily. He walks in a straight line to a greasy-spoon diner nearby on the boardwalk and sits at the counter, but he doe not twirl on his stool, nor stir his coffee, nor roll his eyes.
Once he talked about his obsessive activity: “I’m in control of walking, but out of control too. When I walk I’m in a trance. If I slow down at night I see colors. I see millions of faces—some with Pilgrim hats, some with cowboy hats—modern faces and prehistoric faces.”
There must be some kind of spiritual path that the sweating, red-faced Pacer keeps treading, even if it’s circular--some unique relationship with the universe by which he justifies his existence to himself. Everybody has to feel they’re making some contribution to society, if only to maintain self-esteem. Even those who work in a missile factory must rationalize, “Well, the United States needs to have a strong defense.”
It’s an absurd age we live in. Future Shock is already an outdated book. Children whose shoes stay on their feet by the grace of Velcro may never experience the thrill of tying their shoelaces in the dark. They have developed a fast-food approach to perceiving time because all they know is digital clocks. Time goes click, click, and if the power goes off they think that 12:00-12:00-12:00 is appliance language for “Help! Help! Help! Turn me back to the right time! Help! Help! Help!”
Kids have lost that certain sense of time in motion, going around and around, eternally. That concept is endangered, just like the whooping crane. But we can all be grateful to the Pacer, for he is the Keeper of the Counter-Clockwise. That is his spiritual calling. But the Pacer doesn’t have a cardboard box for people to drop money into—he walks around in circles out of the goodness of his heart.
*   *   *
The Mime and the Pacer provide a perfect metaphor for the two-party system in America. The Republicans are like the Mime, standing absolutely still while the world passes them by—Iran, Iraq, Nicaragua, El Salvador—and they get paid for it, just like the Mime. The Democrats are like the Pacer, walking around in circles while the world passes them by—Israel, Libya, Cuba, Honduras—and they don’t get paid for it, just like the Pacer.
But recently the Pacer did something that hurled such a comparison right into the metaphor graveyard, along with “That’s like bringing coals to Newcastle” (for Newcastle finally did run out of coal) and “Good as gold” (since the government now prints money without the benefit of the gold standard). The Pacer had put a cardboard box down on the ground and started walking around it. And now people began giving him money.
By the mere presence of that cardboard box, the Pacer had transformed his personal perversion into a marketable talent. Just like so many of us. And I could no longer feel superior to him. He was not just some nut walking in circles. Now he was earning a living.
I still “do” the Pacer in my act, but with increased respect. “His job is no less dignified than anything we do,” I tell the audience. “He works hard all day, and then, just like you and me, he goes home and unwinds.” And I proceed to walk around and around in a circle onstage, only now in a clockwise direction.



Johnnie Cochran Meets Dr. Hip

Tragedy and absurdity were two sides of the same coin: On one side, O.J. Simpson’s “suicide” note with a smiley face in the O of his signature; on the other side, the woman who pinched Simpson lawyer Robert Shapiro’s ass because “I wanted to be part of history.” And somewhere along the ridge of that coin was Simpson himself, walking into the courtroom humming the melody of “Touch Me” from the Broadway hit Cats and explaining to reporters that he was thinking about his children.
That was at Simpson’s criminal trial. Shortly before his civil trial began in 1997, I met his lead attorney, Johnnie Cochran. He was the guest of honor and luncheon speaker at a national convention of criminal defense attorneys held in a huge banquet hall at a hotel in Santa Monica. No media people were allowed entry.
One of the attendees was Dr. Eugene Schoenfeld, also known as Dr. Hip from his days as a syndicated columnist for the underground press. He now testifies occasionally as an expert witness, and was at this event for that reason. My wife Nancy and I were his guests.
Cochran’s speech reassured the enthusiastic audience: “In the Simpson matter, we just did what you do every day”—that is, defend their clients by any means necessary and chalk up a bunch of billable hours in the process—and he got a standing ovation.
In the afterglow of his speech, colleagues came up to Cochran to shake his hand and get in a little banter. One well-wisher shared this joke: “If [prosecutor] Chris Darden spent as much time trying to nail O.J. Simpson as he did trying to nail [prosecutor] Marcia Clark, he might’ve won the case.” The other defense attorneys within hearing distance all had a good laugh at that one.
Dr. Schoenfeld joined the line of lawyers waiting to have photos taken of themselves standing alongside Cochran.  When it was Schoenfeld’s turn, Nancy focused her camera. For this particular occasion, Schoenfeld had stashed a hand-printed card underneath the standard, plastic-encased ID lapel card. As in the previous poses, Cochran and Schoenfeld put their arms around each other, although they were looking, not at each other, but straight ahead and smiling at the camera.
Thus, Cochran didn’t notice how, just before Nancy snapped their picture, Schoenfeld subtly managed to pull away the ID card and reveal the hand-printed card, which declared, in large printed letters, “O.J. DID IT!” I published that photo on the front cover of The Realist that spring. It was the result of a good old-fashioned guerrilla action.

Jealousy At the Swingers Convention

The 24th annual Lifestyles Couples Convention has filled three hotels in Palm Springs, California. The Convention Center is connected to one of them, the Wyndham, which surrounds a large outdoor pool and patio populated by couples busy socializing in 116-degree dry heat. Women and men alike are wearing thongs. From afar they appear like so many eyeless smiley faces among the bathing suits. The law that Sonny Bono signed when he was mayor, banning thongs in public, does not apply to this event, or, for that matter, to Cher.
The convention is for couples only. Except for me. I’ve been hired to perform stand-up comedy at their Friday luncheon, and I’m here alone. On the small, propellor plane from Los Angeles to Palm Springs, the right side consists of two-seat rows, occupied entirely by couples on their way to the convention—horny with the expectation of getting laid by the spouse of a stranger, perhaps sitting in front of or behind them—and the left side of the plane consists of one-seat rows, occupied entirely by me. I’m afraid that the plane might tip over upon trying to land.
At the Convention Center, even the plastic-encased lapel nametags are coupled off: “Ken and Barbie” on his, “Barbie and Ken” on hers. Not all the couples are paired off in real lie, though. One person can simply bring along another—known in swinger circles as a “ticket” for gender balance—in order to get into the convention. So everybody has entered two by two, and I feel like a unicorn stowaway on Noah’s Ark, surreptitiously balancing on the cusp of love and lust.
There are 3,000 participants at this convention, mostly upper-middle-class, in their 30s, 40s and 50s. They consider people in the outside world to be “straight,” even though one would ordinarily consider them straight. I mean there are suburban soccer moms here, openly celebrating their secret lifestyle at an oasis of supportiveness. There’s a man in a suit with a flesh-colored penis necktie, another wearing a T-shirt declaring “I’m Not Going Bald, I’m Getting More Head,” and another dressed only in a leather jockstrap, who recognizes me and introduces himself.
“I’d give you my card,” he says, “but I have no place to keep them.”
Inside the 100,000 square-foot Convention Center, the Exhibit Hall has been turned into an “Adult Marketplace,” buzzing with commercial activity. I overhear one shopper’s complaint: “But we’ve already spent $400.” There’s a multitude of merchandise on display—pornographic videos, naughty lingerie, fetish paraphernalia, edible lotions—plus booths galore. At the Golden Nipples booth, women are cheerfully having exact duplicates of their nipples created in sterling silver or 14-karat gold, which can be used as pendants, key fobs, money clips or—yes, of course—nipple covers. At the Penimax booth, an Asian vendor is selling disposable cock rings, which, he promises, will maintain my erection even after I ejaculate.
There are several booths dedicated to booking vacations especially designed for swingers, at nude beaches, clothing-optional resorts and ocean cruises. I follow around an elderly woman who is busy picking up brochures at every such booth. It seems incongruous, but I try not to indulge in stereotypes. Finally I engage her in a conversation, and she explains that her boss told her to get as much material as she could, because he owns some property surrounded by government land, and he wants to start a new business.
At the Erotic Massage Wear table, a woman uses my arm to demonstrate a device that turns her fingertip into a vibrator, not intended for nose picking. Then she puts Jergen’s Lotion on my right hand, dons a pair of Love Mitts—made of vinyl with little nubs all over—and proceeds to massage my hand while on the VCR there’s a tape of a woman wearing Love Mitts and massaging a man’s lubricated penis. This is a bizarre mixed-media sensation. Although I don’t get a hard-on, the lobes of my brain seem to fuse, and for the next few hours my left hand persists in feeling neglected.
Checking out the functional furniture, I merely eavesdrop on a (fully clothed) couple testing out the “rocking torso feature” on a Love Table, but I actually climb into the Love Swing, assuming a position ordinarily assumed by a woman while the man stands up, crotch to crotch. My body is suspended half upside-down in mid-air with legs spread and feet up in stirrups. I’m feeling mighty vulnerable. As I hang there, the inventor hands me my tape recorder, then proceeds to show me how “the woman can place the man’s penis on her G-spot by moving her legs from a position of being out front like this to being in the fetal position” and how “the man, instead of just going in and out like that, he can make his penis a joystick, so every step he takes is a movement inside of her, more like a dance step.” He guarantees, “You’ll never use a bed again.”
Next I inspect the Bungee Sexperience—a harness designed by a company that makes bungee cords—it bounces in the air, so the “rider” can enjoy weightless sex in a variety of positions. I ask the woman demonstrating this how many hours a day she bounces up and down. “At an event like this,” she responds, without missing a bounce, “I’d say eight to twelve hours.” She tells me that her circulation is excellent, and that her 18-year-old son refers to the contraption as a “bungee humper.” In addition to bouncing, it can also create “the illusion of bondage, yet the person can actually be comfortable while restrained.”
The Auto Erotic Chair, however, provides real bondage. It’s equipped with leather restraints and panic snaps for arms and legs, and comes complete with a power box, pneumatically operated anal and vaginal plugs. “Our power source unit is designed to stimulate nerve fibers throughout the genital areas by delivering controllable electro-pulse energy through conductive electrodes on our sex toys. Our precision-engineered technology gives you safe and pleasurable electric play.” So, for example, in the Electro-Flex Penile Ring/Anal Plug Configuration, “A single conductor butt plug is used in conjunction with a single conductive cock ring to complete the circuit. With a single conductive cock ring, one side of a double conductive butt plug can be used to stimulate either the prostate or the sphincter.”
If you’d prefer something, well, less electric, there’s always the Crystal Wand, a 10-inch-long, S-shaped co-ed tool, hand-carved from pure crystal-clear acrylic, that doubles simultaneously as a G-spot stimulator and prostate massager. I’m reminded of a swing party I heard about, one that took place at the Whispers Club in Michigan. Couples removed from the refrigerator 12-inch summer sausages and cucumbers that the hostess had planned to use for food that evening. When she walked into the “party room,” she couldn’t help but notice that although the food was being consumed, it was not exactly in the fashion she had originally envisioned. Instead, the sausages and cucumbers were being utilized as organic sex toys.
As I continue to wander around the Adult Marketplace, I realize that the name of the game is penetration. All paths lead to penetration. But I’m not referring to penetration of the sexual kind, although that’s an implicit goal—pick an orifice, any orifice, and there’s always a corresponding appendage or gadget that can fulfill its desire for penetration—no, I’m talking about penetration of the market. There’s lots of money to be made here. The persistent question is, how can I penetrate this market? Maybe I could come up with a combination FM radio and vibrating dildo.

I’m beginning to feel like I’m experiencing an alien encounter, only I’m the alien here. Nevertheless, I’m aware that swingers and comedians do have something in common. We both like to have a good opening line. As a performer, I always try to slant my opening line toward a particular audience.
My opening line at the World Hemp Expo was, “Last night, for the first time in my life, I used a hemp condom.” My opening line at a Skeptics Conference, attended by the Amazing Randi and the Amazing Kreskin, was: “The is the first conference I’ve been to where there were two people with the same first name of Amazing—but the Amazing Randi was born with that name, it’s on his birth certificate, whereas the Amazing Kreskin changed his name for showbiz--his real name is the Obnoxious Kreskin.” And my opening line at a luncheon during the Los Angeles County Bar Association conference was, “I’d like to begin with a moment of silence, so that you can think about your client’s problem, and then you can make this a billable hour.”
Now I find myself in a lavish hotel suite, trying to crystallize an opening line while contemplating the bald spot on the back of my head, infinitely cloned in the mirrors of the hotel-room bathroom, actually the only place I ever get to see that bald spot as others do. This will be a serious opening line, since I have been told that, in the introduction to my performance, I will be presented with the Lifestyles Freedom Award. I decide that my opening line will then be, “I just want to say that freedom of expression existed long before the First Amendment.” Though it’s not my motivation, I realize that this opening line will undoubtedly please Robert McGinley, the bearded co-founder and president of the Lifestyles Organization.
“We hate government intervention in our lives,” he has assured me. “We hate censorship. We’re against laws that require helmets for cyclists. It’s good that a law was just passed allowing women to breastfeed in public, but we shouldn’t need permission from the government to do it.” He admits to being “libertarian, but not Libertarian Party.” He draws his philosophy from Jack London—“The proper function of man is to live, not to exist”—and, more specifically, his credo is “Adult sexuality is normal.” Dr. McGinley (he holds a Ph.D. in counseling psychology) tells me a riddle: “What do you call an Italian swinger?” I give up. The answer: “A swop.”
At the luncheon, it turns out that I will not be presented with the Freedom Award after all, and I have to come up immediately with a replacement opening line: “I’m delighted to be at the Lifestyles Convention—this is the first convention I’ve ever been to that was named after a condom.”
Indeed, condom consciousness (if not condom use) is present at the convention. In one workshop, “The ABC’s of Swinging,” condom etiquette is described as bringing “the right safety equipment, just as you would for scuba diving or parachuting.” Another presentation on “Safer Sex” covers new drug therapies for AIDS, information on other sexually transmitted diseases that are increasing among heterosexuals, and “things you should be doing to protect yourself.”
Originally, herpes had caused a certain panic in swinger circles. Some swing clubs closed, though private parties increased. But, paradoxically enough, with the advent of AIDS, new clubs opened, as if the disease were anti-climactic. Currently, there’s a surge of growth in this subculture—thanks to the Internet—with estimates ranging from 2,000 to three million participants. And, according to Dr. McGinley, “There’s been very little increase in condom use. It’s the woman’s choice.”
Nonetheless, at the Adult Marketplace, a woman in a black lace negligee roams around giving out free samples of condoms. There are also Crème Cookie Condoms for sale. They appear to be vanilla and chocolate Oreo-style cookies, individually wrapped in cellophane. I ask the vendor whether these are condoms that look like cookies, or cookies that look like condoms. She tells me that they are edible cookies, but each one has a condom inside.
“They’re only a dollar each,” she says, adding, as I edge away from her booth, “it’s a great joke.”

The Art Gallery at the convention Center, featuring the Lifestyles Convention’s 7th annual Sensual & Erotic Art Exhibition, almost didn’t happen. The state’s Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control had tried to prevent it from opening. When their authority was challenged, an ABC representative became an alchemist, transforming logic into absurdity. Legally, he said, you can’t even have sex in a hotel room which has a mini-bar. Sure, pal, just try to enforce that one.
Two days before the convention, the ACLU obtained a restraining order against ABC’s interference with the art exhibit. But ABC didn’t just give up and assume the fetal position in a Love Swing. Rather, the agency threatened to revoke the Wyndham Hotel’s liquor license if they allowed a special two-hour session, the convention’s traditional Evening of Caressive Intimacy, to take place in the Wyndham Ballroom on Friday as scheduled. This popular, closed-door, clothing-optional massage clinic, limited to the first 200 couples who sign up, would include the “human car wash,” involving, as one veteran swinger portrays it, “a lot of naked bodies and some serious rubbing.”
But the ABC regulations on Attire and Conduct—behavior “deemed contrary to public welfare and morals, and therefore no on-sale license shall be held at any premises where such conduct or acts are permitted”—includes this clause as a no-no: “To encourage or permit any person on the licensed premises to touch, caress or fondle the breasts, buttocks, anus or genitals of any other person.” The Wyndham chickens out, the massage clinic is canceled, the money is refunded, Lifestyles will sue the hotel for breach of contract, and next year’s convention will be held in Las Vegas in 1998.
A lawyer, standing on the border of cynicism, suggests, “Just buy a town in Mexico and buy off all the officials.”
In the previous year, 1996, the convention was held at the Town & Country Hotel in San Diego (for the fourth time), but two ABC officers claimed that they witnessed oral copulation in the convention hall, and the hotel’s liquor license was suspended for five days, hence Lifestyle’s move to Palm Springs this year. Lately, ABC has been spreading its particular brand of paranoia in Los Angeles, where the agency has raided gay, black and Latino bars in Los Angeles and in Hermosa Beach, where it has imposed restrictions on restaurants, requiring patio patrons to order food with their drinks, and forbidding customers to dance. Proprietors now play less upbeat music so that nobody will be tempted to dance. Those who can’t resist are asked to stop.
Incidentally, I find out that, instead of giving the Freedom Award to me, convention officials have decided to present ABC with an Anti-Freedom Award, but that notion gets lost somewhere in award limbo, along with my original unspoken opening line.
On Friday night, the massage clinic that doesn’t take place is followed by the Wild West Casino and Dance. One man comes attired in a sheriff’s outfit with a rubber penis drooping almost to the floor. A security guard tells him that he’ll have to check it. Fake knives, guns and bullets are acceptable, but not a fake sex organ. Another cowboy, with a real (unloaded) gun, is stopped by a security guard, but he resists, asserting in his best John Wayne manner, “This is an 1887 pistol, and I’m not about to check it.”
Several folks leave the dance at midnight to attend an unofficial 3rd annual spanking party. It ends at 3 a.m. with a bout of fist fucking. Dear Abby was right. One thing does lead to another.

I’ve been sampling many workshops at the Convention Center, and I notice that whenever I sit down on a chair next to a chair with someone else’s stuff on it, and the owner of that stuff is sitting on the other side of that chair, they always tap the top of their stuff in a subconscious gesture of territoriality. I also observe that a man with one leg (he walks with crutches) and his wife seem to arrive at every single workshop that I attend. Hmmmmm. I’m beginning to get suspicious. Obviously, I’ve seen too many spy movies.
A cartoon in the 1991 convention program showed two rooms where lectures were being given. The attendees in the room featuring “Do It Yourself Porn: Make Your Own XXX Movies” were overflowing into the corridor, while the room featuring “Socio-Political Ramifications of Current Trends in the Erosion of Civil Liberties” was empty, except for the baffled lecturer. It was a nice touch of self-deprecating humor, an exaggeration not too far from reality. At this ’97 convention, porn actress Nina Hartley’s “So You Want to Throw a Party: Recipes for a Successful Orgy” attracts ten times more audience than attorney Bob Burke’s “Sexual Politics: A Behind the Scenes Look.”
Unfortunately, one workshop, “The Undertone of Sexuality in the Star Trek Series,” has been canceled—“due,” someone added to the notice, “to Federation Regulations and Star Fleet Emergency Order 1007-932.” Deborah Warner, in describing her presentation, had written: “Paramount and its parent company, Viacom, have a vested interest in presenting the Trek franchise as a family-oriented show. To this end, they overtly depict the characters as asexual. Yet there exists erotic subtext. This has spawned a very large community of fans who create volumes of explicit erotica that is enjoying great popularity in print and an explosion of interest on the Internet.”
Now, outside the room where her workshop would have been, there is disappointment--“Oh, and she was gonna bring a Klingon”--and nostalgia--“Remember the time Quark and Deanna were French-kissing?”
That theme continues at “American Tantra: How to Worship Each Other in Bed,” This workshop—whose motto, “Orgasm long and prosper,” paraphrases Star Trek’s blessing, “Live long and prosper”—is conducted by Paul Ramana Das and Marilena Silbey. “Interspecies intercourse,” he muses. “This can’t be the only planet where love is made.” A writer for AVN (Adult Video News) has reviewed their Intimate Secrets of Sex & Spirit and confessed, “I’ve rarely laughed so hard in my life. No shit, this vid earns a pre-nomination for ‘most outrageous sex scene.’ Paul actually uses Marilena’s pussy as an echo chamber!”
Now, in his regular voice, he is telling our workshop of the need to “approach the body, not for sexual release, but for every single inch of this body, the groundwork, the geography of pleasure. Can anybody name one spot on your body that is not capable of receiving pleasure?” Nobody can. Later, the entire audience, seated around the perimeter of this extra-large room, is instructed to come stand in the center area and face their partners. I start to slide out, but not inconspicuously enough. Ramana Das, who knows me from a previous incarnation, calls out, “There goes Paul Krassner. Are you afraid to participate?”
“I’m here as a journalist.”
“Ah, he can’t participate because he’s a journalist. See how everybody has excuses.”
Suddenly I’m saddled with a dose of New Age guilt, as though I have aborted my inner child. Meanwhile, there’s a lovely blonde who doesn’t have a partner, and now I’m tempted to participate, but some guy who’s also without a partner links up with her. Unexpectedly, my guilt changes to jealousy. Just a slight pang of jealousy, mind you, but a terrible taboo in this particular world.
Jealousy is an outmoded emotion to be shunned like dandruff. There’s even a workshop that advises “How to Handle Jealousy” and another titled “Swing Without Guilt or Jealousy.” And so now I not only feel guilty about not participating, I also feel guilty about feeling jealous. I’ve committed a swinger crime. I can hear security guards shouting “Jealousy alert!” Loud sirens go off. “Jealousy alert!”
Now where will I go? I have been reading about tantra in Real Magic by Isaac Bonewits: “Energy control is a very important part of the exercises; it is essential, for example, that during Kama-kali the male be able to refrain from ejaculating under the most harrowing circumstances.” I decide to drop in on a workshop, “How to Prevent Premature Ejaculation,” but everybody has already been there, and they all left early. Sorry. I blurted that out before I could stop myself.

There are swing clubs all around the country, from “Shenanigans” in Indiana to “Liberated Christians” in Arizona (“for Christians seeking liberation from false sexual repression based on mistranslation of scripture who wish to explore responsible non-monogamy and polyfidelity”). Many clubs designate themselves as Equal Opportunity Lifestyle Organizations, where membership is open to all races, and they belong to NASCA (North American Swing Club Association).
The Spring 1997 issue of NASCA Inside Report editorializes:
“There are political attacks on freedom that citizens should be aware of. It is far too easy to lose, through complacency and ignorance, the freedom that we Americans cherish. These attacks include the proposed censorship of the Internet now under review by the U.S. Supreme Court, the recently court-upheld attempts by states to keep ‘harmful’ literature from the eyes of children by controlling street news racks, the reintroduction in Pennsylvania of legislation to outlaw swing clubs and a similar measure in California. Regarding the latter two, do we smell a conspiracy here?” If there is one, it’s bi-partisan.
In Pennsylvania, Richard Kasunic, a Democratic state senator, failed in his 1996 attempt to outlaw “sex clubs.” This year, he has reintroduced legislation to outlaw “swinger clubs.” He states, “My bill will outlaw these immoral establishments in every community in Pennsylvania and provide significant penalties for those who choose to continue this offensive practice.” The penalty for operating a swing club, even in one’s own home: up to two years in jail and $5,000 in fines. For a second conviction: up to seven years and $15,000. For patronizing a swing club: $300 plus court costs.
In California, Tim Leslie, a Republican state senator, has introduced a bill which would provide that “every building or place which, as a primary activity, accommodates or encourages persons to engage in, or to observe other persons engaging in, sexual conduct including, but not limited to, anal intercourse, oral copulation or vaginal intercourse, is a nuisance and shall be enjoined, abated and prevented, and for which damages may be recovered, whether it is a public or private nuisance.”
Swinger periodicals range from New Friends to Fuck Thy Neighbor. Patti Thomas, author of Recreational Sex: An Insider’s Guide to the Swinging Lifestyle, is editor at Connection, which publishes thirteen titles, including Cocoa ’n Crème, catering to interracial swingers (not to be confused with Black ’n Blue, catering to sadomasochist swingers). Connection is suing the federal government over a bill that Ronald Reagan sent to Congress in 1987, the Child Protection and Obscenity Act, an outgrowth of the Meese Commission on Pornography.
The specific statute being challenged—known as the record keeping and labeling law, or the ID law—was supposed to be aimed at child pornography, but has been applied to adults-only swing publications. It requires anyone placing an explicit photo ad to provide a photo ID, nicknames, maiden names, stage names, professional names and aliases. These records must be available for inspection by the attorney general’s office.
Connection had attempted to comply with the law by cutting out every explicit photo ad from its magazines and sending them with a letter to those advertisers, explaining the new law and its requirements, asking that they submit the proper ID or send a “soft” photo that didn’t require ID. Out of 500 advertisers, only 26 responded with IDs. Patti Thomas spoke about this in her keynote speech at the Conclave ’97 Convention in Chicago:
“It definitely makes it difficult to produce the magazine our readers and subscribers have come to expect, when you don’t have enough so-called ‘legal’ ads to fill all those pages. And considering that swinging itself is not illegal, why should we have to ‘register our sexual choices’ with the government just to place a personal ad in a magazine? . . . I’ve never really thought of myself as an activist, or as one who was ‘politically involved,’ but over the last few years I think I’ve finally come to realizing that it’s going to be necessary to be involved, even if it does mean ‘exposing’ my lifestyle to those who would repress it. I am fucking sick and tired of do-gooders trying to tell me how I should live my life!”
In 1995, Connection filed a suit challenging the constitutionality of the law and seeking a permanent injunction. In 1997, the motion was denied. Attorneys filed an appeal and a motion for a temporary injunction relieving Connection from complying with the act during that appeal. The motion was granted.
“The justice system in this country just makes no sense to me whatsoever,” Patti Thomas tells me. “As far as I know, once we do present our case to the Court of Appeals, if our decision isn’t favorable, we will make every attempt to go to the Supreme Court. Our attorneys are the best First Amendment attorneys anywhere. Our lawsuit has been very costly, as you can imagine, but our company believes very strongly in fighting for our constitutional rights. Our suit was filed not only for the benefit of our company but because we felt that this outrageous law was totally infringing on the civil rights and freedoms of people involved in alternative lifestyles. Obviously, the average person involved in swinging would have no way of combating this law on their own.”
I ask her whether attempts at repression have resulted in politicizing the swinger community.
“I’m afraid we haven’t been very successful,” she replies. “We try to inform our readers about political issues threatening our lifestyle and attempt to get them involved. Unfortunately, many in the lifestyle either don’t believe that the government will actually take away their rights or are too afraid to make a stand. Swingers who have been ‘exposed’ as active participants in the lifestyle have lost jobs, family, community standing and friends as a result.
“People I’ve personally known who have lost their jobs when their swinging activities were discovered just wouldn’t fight back because of the fear of further exposure through the publicity that could have been generated. As a matter of fact, my ex-husband was fired from a management position back in 1980 when someone discovered his photo in one our magazines and brought it to the attention of his superiors. Luckily, he was able to find a position with one of Connection’s affiliate companies. So we pretty much remain an ‘underground minority.’”
That point is underscored by a 29-year-old woman at the convention. “None of us like publicity,” she says. “None of us want to be out in the open. The business world is very conservative.” She is wearing an American flag bikini, although she has never heard of Abbie Hoffman. She was born the same year that he got arrested for wearing an American flag shirt. Nor did she have any way of knowing that when he wore another American flag shirt on The Merv Griffin Show, his half of the TV screen was blocked out all across America. She was, in short, unaware of the roots of her own, limited freedom.

It’s Saturday night, and the Carnival Masquerade Ball is being held in the huge Convention Center Ballroom. On the wall behind the stage are gigantic masks. Above the tables are gold and purple balloons, fashioned after either somebody’s school colors or a Chinese restaurant’s little hot mustard and soy sauce plate. The taped music is loud, and the dancing is raunchy, enhanced by gaudy yellow, blue and red lights. Pheromones are flying, and the costumes are kinky.
“Costumes,” the program states, “may be anything of fertile imagination (genital area musts be covered) for an exotic night of adult social fun.” Hey, look who’s here: Superman. The Phantom of the Opera. The devil. Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse (in a see-through top). An executioner. An Arabian potentate. A gold-plated pharaoh. A chicken lady covered with big yellow feathers. A guy in a dog collar being led around on a leash. And the one-legged man, who is wearing a roller skate as his costume. 
At one point, an announcement is made that the next dance number will be filmed, so anybody who doesn’t wish to be recognized should get off the dance floor. About 80% of the dancers leave. Similarly, taking part in the costume-judging means that permission to be photographed is automatically granted, which results in many contestants not making themselves available to be chosen as possible finalists.
The Best Male Costume goes to a 75-year-old man dressed as a biker stud. The Best Female Costume goes to his 75-year-old wife, dressed as a biker slut. The Best Couple’s Costume goes to a woman with papier mache’ breasts the size of beach balls and her mate with matching enormous testicles but covered by pillowcases and a sign that warns, “Censored by the hotel and ABC.”
A marriage ceremony is performed onstage. The blissful pair have written their own vows; nothing is mentioned about forsaking all others. The newlyweds, their party and a few other couples are invited to a gathering in the suite of a three-time Emmy Award-winning TV producer and his wife. It turns out to be a tantra-filled wedding night. All the women massage the groom, and all the men massage the bride. One woman, a computer animator who wants to become a sexual surrogate, predicts that, as the millennium comes to an end, tantric men will be popping up everywhere.
A retired chairman and CEO of a title and escrow company, who attended another tantra party, tells me, “The difference between the tantra party and the party next door is the fact that at the beginning of the wedding tantra party there was a lot of ceremony and shared tantra ritual, but once we had experienced that, it was every person for themselves. It was like the party next door.” These were closed parties by invitation only. But you didn’t need an invitation for open parties. All you had to do was find them.
The Wyndham Hotel is permeated by a sense of uninhibitedness. In the elevator, a beautiful black woman is looking in the full-length mirror and admiring her new Clit Clip—non-piercing, adjustable, genital jewelry--“not designed to be painful,” I learned at the Adult Marketplace, “just very sensual and aesthetically attractive. The Clit Clip is a long narrow, U- shaped piece of metal, designed to fit around the clitoris hood, with some light-catching Austrian crystals, in your choice of clear, red, blue and purple, dangling from the ends.” The woman in the elevator turns toward me and says, “Isn’t it nice?” Her husband smiles proudly.
“It’s charming,” I reply, “but what are you gonna do if the metal detector goes off at the airport?”
I leave them giggling in the elevator as I get off on a floor where I’ve heard there would be lots of action. I follow one group, but only the couple in front really knows where they’re going. But they happen to be on the way to their own room, and when they get there, they go in, close the door, and we are all left out in the corridor, looking like a perplexed ant farm. Everybody turns around. I am now at the front of the line, so I let them all pass by me as they head in the opposite direction, strolling briskly, except for the one-legged man with the roller skate and crutches, who is gliding gracefully along the carpet. Passersby are asked, in vain, “Where’s the party?” We finally find a room with a porn photo on the door, which is slightly open.
Inside, there are around fifty people in semi-darkness. Exhibitionists and voyeurs, together again. Here a blow job, there a copulation, everywhere an undulating juiciness. There is an unspoken homophobia—no man is relating sexually to another man—but there is lots of lesbian libido. In order to keep a low profile, I have ripped several pages out of my notebook and folded them in half, so that I can take notes unobtrusively.
However, a woman with a feather duster asks me to hold on to her panties. She is about to join a threesome on the king-sized bed near the bureau that I’m leaning against. I marvel at the choreography of this foursome. But they’re playing, and I’m working. Their moans become my background music.
I wasn’t always a wallflower at the orgy. I flash back 30 years to 1967 . . . I was at a Sexual Freedom League couples-only party on New Year’s Eve at a large theatrical studio in San Francisco. There were about 150 people dancing in the nude. Behind the closed curtains on the stage there were fifteen small mattresses in constant use by different couples.
I remember making love on one of those mattresses with a sweet flower child only fifteen minutes after we’d met. It was an exhilarating experience. We were on the front lines of the Sexual Revolution. We had to hold back from screaming out political slogans at our moment of climax. The seeds of contemporary swinging were planted at that party, but who could have known it would blossom into an industry?

If it’s true that, as Bill Maher once stated so poetically, “The real problem with marriage is that it’s just very difficult to bump your uglies with the same person every night your whole life,” then for some people, swinging is the answer. To them, cheating is not an issue, unfaithfulness is obsolescent, and adultery is merely a concept that deprived former Air Force Lieutenant Kelly Flinn of her opportunity to drop a nuclear bomb.
The Lifestyles Convention provides a nurturing environment for these couples the same way a convention of crossword-puzzle enthusiasts or barbed-wire collectors would provide for those folks. Yet, in the case of swingers, one is left with a puzzle. Is impersonal intimacy an oxymoron? I ask that question of psychologist Stella Resnick, sex therapist and author of The Pleasure Zone. Her reply:
“We can’t put a value judgment on this. These are all consenting adults. It doesn’t really matter that it’s rather impersonal because they are in long-term relationships, so they’re getting their intimacy needs met, but not necessarily their needs for excitement in sex, and this is certainly a way to do it. Often they are sexually identified in the sense that they’re sexual people, they have strong desires, they’re not necessarily into politics or other causes, but this is a good cause—being in the body, being healthy—and it’s a way of relaxing and enjoying their bodies. Whatever turns you on, as long as you’re not doing any damage to anybody else and you’re taking care of yourself, fine, enjoy.”
When Tom Arnold was a guest on Late Show, David Letterman pressed him about his friendship with Kathie Lee and Frank Gifford. This was shortly after the Globe had entrapped and videotaped Gifford’s extramarital tryst with a flight attendant in a hotel room. Letterman insisted, “I don’t revel in the miseries of others,” but Arnold reminded him of his monologues with jokes about Gifford. Letterman defended himself: “It’s part of the job.” Arnold stammered, searching for just the right words. He finally found them: “Frank Gifford took a bullet for a lot of us.” And the audience applauded the accuracy of his assessment.
Certainly, non-celebrities don’t have to worry about supermarket tabloids revealing infidelities to their spouses. Such exposure could never occur with swinging couples, not only because, as a rule, they are honest with each other, but also because they party with each other, so there are no surprises. They are sharing a secret lifestyle, one with an ethic that transcends ordinary romance. Sneaky affairs are for straight people, but swingers can eat their wedding cake and have their fantasies too. Which explains why there have been no hookers hanging around this convention.

Life Among the Neo-Pagans

In the summer of 1997, I performed at the 17th annual Starwood Neo-Pagan Festival in Sherman, New York—Amish country on the border near Ohio and Pennsylvania. This event—a female-oriented celebration of the sensual and the spiritual—took place on private campgrounds, where clothing was optional. Many women were bare-breasted, and several men and women walked around fully naked, a practice known as the “sky clad” experience.
Instead of camping out, I stayed at a nearby bed-and-breakfast place. Downstairs in the living room, I asked a woman—falsely assuming that she was the proprietor—where the key would be left if I came back late at night.
“I don’t know,” she replied. “I’m here for the festival.”
“Oh. In what capacity?”
“I’m in the craft.”
“Which craft?”
“That’s right,” she said.
She has been a Wiccan for twenty years, but now she complained, “Witchcraft has become trendy. I mean, ever since Buffy the Vampire Slayer . . .”
At the festival, on Merchants Row, there was an inviting banner over one of the booths: “Stop by for a Spell.” A positive perspective on witchcraft was a theme at this event, along with such workshops as “Privacy Rights and Drug Policy,” “Cultivating Consciousness in Your Child,” “Live Meditations in Drumming and Dance,” “The Supreme Court and the Free Exercise of Religion, “A Procession to Honor the Earth Goddess,” “Safer Sex” and “Dark Ecstasy: The Ritual Use of Pleasure, Pain and Sensory Deprivation as Psychedelic Experience.”
When I walked on to the outdoor stage, my opening line was “I’m gonna start with two words that have been thought year after year at these festivals, but which have never actually been uttered out loud, and those two wards are: “Nice tits.” The audience hesitated a second, because in that context this could be a politically incorrect observation—I had deliberately taken that chance—but then they laughed and applauded, because they knew it was true.
I was invited back to perform at Starwood again in the summer of 1998. The previous month, two Amish men had been arrested for distributing cocaine they bought from a biker gang, the Pagans, one of whose members was a police informer. The two men were from a particularly conservative Amish sect, where not only electricity and tractors were forbidden, but even zippers. Did the sight of those Amish-tempting zippers on the Pagans’ leather motorcycle jackets serve as a gateway drug to cocaine?
Speaking of illegal drugs, at the festival I came across the only individual I’ve ever met who had actually hallucinated on toad slime. I pictured him as a young lad with a tadpole in his pocket, and now as a grown man with a frog in his pocket.
I also met Reverend Ivan Stang, leader of the infamous Church of the SubGenius. He talked about “how to milk the Internet for all it’s worth, and get away with murder, before the Conspiracy figures out how to spoil it for us.” But Stang was in deep embarrassment mode, since this was only a couple of weeks after the failure of his widely circulated prediction that, on July 5th at 7 a.m., Pleasure Saucers would descend to Earth as part of the great “Rupture” and take away all those SubGeniuses who had paid $30 for the privilege.
The festival climaxed with its traditional 50-foot-diameter, 25-foot-high bonfire, constructed during the week with the aid of a derrick. On Saturday night, several dancers with torches ritualistically teased this pyramid of logs, encircled at a distance by two thousand enthusiasts, although one impatient woman yelled, “Just do it!” The neo-pagans danced and pranced and cavorted around the bonfire late into the night.
My own personal highlight occurred when a beautiful woman named Pearl approached me. She was in the process of transforming her breasts from fetish to functional by nursing a baby that had been conceived there the year before. During that festival, she had walked in on my performance, bare-breasted, at the precise moment that I uttered the words, “Nice tits.” She assumed that I was referring specifically to her and, I had learned, she was flattered, so now I didn’t have the heart to disillusion her. But I did write about it in my High Times column, “Brain Damage Control,” ending with this sentence: “I hope she doesn’t read this.”
Furthermore, at the 20th annual Starwood Festival in 2000, I found myself in front of a microphone on that same stage, and I told that story. Pearl was in the audience, and she was laughing heartily. This time, though, when I said, “Nice tits,” I added, “Okay, now everybody,” and the words came booming back at me: ‘NICE TITS!’” Later, as I was leaving the stage, Pearl called out, “Nice dick!” I was fully dressed, but it didn’t matter. This was a perfect example of tit for tat. Or dick for tit.
My old friend Steve Gaskin and I were staying at a bed-and-breakfast house where there were angels all over the place. Stuffed angels, plastic angels, plaster-of-paris angels, embroidered angels, stained-glass angels, papier-mache’ angels, teddy-bear angels and origami angels. There were angel dolls and angel paintings and angel sculptures and even an angel mobile hanging from the ceiling. In the bathroom, there was an angel tissue-dispenser and an angel night-light. On a table in the hallway, there was a pile of Angels on Earth magazine. On the bureau in my room, there was a copy of Whispers From Heaven, featuring such articles as “Feeding Angels,” “When Angels Kiss” and “Rescued by Angels: The Amazing Story of a Kidnapping Survivor.”
Gaskin’s room had a door that led to the roof, and the first night we sat out there and smoked a joint. The next day there was a note taped to the door: “The roof is to be used only as a fire escape. Please use the patio.” The next night we smoked a joint in my room. And the next day there was a “No Smoking” sign on the inside of my door, and the electric fan was on, aimed toward the now-open window.
At breakfast the next morning, I was just about to apologize to the kindly Christian woman whose home this was, explaining that a doctor had recommended marijuana for my arthritis, but she apologized to me because she hadn’t told me in advance that smoking wasn’t allowed. “Some people are allergic to cigarette smoke,” she explained, and I almost blurted out, “That wasn’t tobacco, that was pot.”
I hope she doesn’t read this.

Murder At the Conspiracy Convention

“The history of civilization is the history of warfare
between secret societies.” --Ishmael Reed

In the men’s room at the airport, a man standing at the urinal a couple of urinals away from my urinal was urinating without aiming his penis. Both hands were flossing his teeth. A monument to multi-tasking. I’ll admit that I occasionally brush my teeth while I’m urinating—at least that leaves me with one hand free to steer—but this guy could possibly be the only human being on earth who pisses and flosses simultaneously.
He must have practiced at home before he decided to go public. And of course he was proud of his manual dexterity. Maybe he even has a license plate that says PFLOSS, though other drivers might assume it’s his name, not his avocation. In any case, that image immediately replaced my previous visual mantra: seeing one of the kids on a school bus holding up to the window a sign that read HELP US!--and laughing with his classmates.
Now, on Memorial Day weekend, I was catching a flight to San Jose, California. I was headed for Conspiracy Con 2001, a convention featuring the prophets of the sinister.
My friend Roy Zimmerman, who writes and sings satirical folk songs in the tradition of Tom Lehrer, has a spoken piece of patter which goes: “I just got back from the conspiracy convention. Have you been? It’s fun. Seven hundred conspiracy theorists all in one hotel, with the little name tags, ‘Hello, my name is—none of your fucking business!’ Great seminars—‘Triangulation and You, ‘Paranoia for Profit,’ ‘Victoria’s Real Secret Was J. Edgar Hoover.’ In the lobby, I saw five people get off the elevator—what, you think that’s a coincidence? There was entertainment, of course—a group of horny anti-government folk singers called the Randy Weavers.”
Zimmerman was surprised to learn that there would actually be an event such as the one that he thought he was making up. Although the real conspiracy convention didn’t have the seven hundred attendees he had imagined, there were over 500, including 40% from out of state and 10% from other countries, including Canada, England, Australia, Denmark, Austria and Ireland. Also taking place at the Santa Clara Convention Center that same weekend as Conspiracy Con was the Charismatic Catholic Convention. Dueling religions, together again.
*   *   *
The leadoff speaker at Conspiracy Con was Cathy O’Brien, who claimed to be a victim of the CIA’s MK-Ultra child-sex-slave program, Project Monarch. She was introduced by her husband, Mark Phillips, as “the love of my life.” Phillips claims that, having worked for the CIA, where he learned hypnosis, and for a Department of Defense subcontractor with exposure to mind-control research, he was able to rescue O’Brien, deprogram her and collaborate on their book, Trance Formation of America.
“There is not one person in this audience,” he exhorts, “that could not be legally experimented on, killed or financially destroyed.”
He has the bearing, the cadence and the pompadour of a dramatically pious televangelist. He oozes with practiced integrity. In contrast, Cathy O’Brien has the demeanor of a guileless, bleached-blond checkout cashier in a small-town supermarket who sends money every week to her favorite televangelist. She speaks with a certain tremor in her voice.
“Mind control,” she warns, “is the most important issue facing humanity today.”
She reveals her relationship with Gerald Ford, who was “very much interested in mind control, so the local Michigan Mafia child pornography ring was actually sanctioned, and they could target children like myself who were so horribly abused that they would be used in child pornography. When my father was caught sending this pornography through the mail, Gerald Ford approached and told him that he could receive immunity from prosecution if he would sell me into the project. My father eagerly agreed. He was so happy that the government actually condoned child abuse that he went on to have five more children to raise for the project, so there were seven of us in all. He was never prosecuted and remains free for reasons of national security.”
At the age of 13, she met the man “who would become my owner”—Senator Robert Byrd. In Trance Formation, she describes their first meeting:
“I undressed and climbed into his bed as ordered. I was momentarily relieved to find that his penis was abnormally tiny—so small it didn’t even hurt! And I could breathe with it in my mouth! Then he began to indulge himself in his brutal perversions, talking on and on about how I was ‘made just for him’ due to the vast amounts of pain I could withstand. The spankings and police handcuffs I had previously endured were child’s play compared to Senator Byrd’s near-death tortures. The hundreds of scars on my body still show today.
“I was one of the only kids in my school who listened to country music. But then, Senator Byrd fancied himself a country music fiddler, and it was ‘my duty to love what he did.’ I was ordered to listen to country music or no music at all. Music was my psychological avenue for escape, a dissociative tool. CIA operator Merle Haggard, who often used well-documented cryptic language in his songs pertaining to government mind-control slave operations, released songs including ‘Freedom Train’ and ‘Over the Rainbow.’
“My father told me repeatedly that Merle Haggard was my ‘favorite’ singer, and his songs reinforced my programming. Of course, Senator Byrd remained my ‘favorite’ fiddler’ as ordered. He played train songs like ‘Orange Blossom Special’ while making train sounds on his fiddle. Sometimes I was his captive audience, bound and gagged, while he played his fiddle. Other times he instructed me to spin round and round like a music box dancer in order to add ‘new dimensions to our sex.’ These new dimensions included more and more physical pain through ‘kinky’ torture.”
It was Senator Byrd who directed her father to send her to Catholic school, and it was Gerald Ford who became “my first president.” That night, she recalls, “I wore my Catholic uniform as instructed and went into a dissociative trance as my father drove me to the local National Guard Armory, where I was prostituted to Ford. He took me into an empty room, pushed me down on the wooden floor as he unzipped his pants and said, ‘Pray on this.’ Then he brutally, sexually assaulted me. Afterward, my memory was compartmentalized through use of high voltage. I was then carried out to the car where I lay in the back seat, muscles contracted, stunned, in pain, and unable to move.”
And then there was Dick Cheney, President Ford’s chief of staff. After Cathy was hunted down and caught in Cheney’s game of “human hunting,” she stood naked in his hunting-lodge office as he paced around and gave her this choice: “I could stuff you and mount you like a jackalope and call you a two-legged deer. Or I could stuff you with this--he unzipped his pants to reveal his oversized penis--right down your throat and then mount you. Which do you prefer?”
Apparently, Cheney’s oversized penis balanced out Senator Byrd’s tiny penis--a tawdry version of Emerson’s Law of Compensation.
Cathy specialized in political figures (although she was also thrust upon by country singers such as “CIA operatives” Merle Haggard and Kris Kristofferson). With unintentional prophetic irony, Cathy described her 1983 meeting with Ronald Reagan, George Bush and Dick Cheney: “Reagan gestured toward Bush and said, ‘This is my vice president. People don’t usually know what the role of the vice president is because he’s always behind the scenes making sure everything that the president wants done happens the way it’s supposed to.’ He looked at me and said matter-of-factly, ‘I catch the public’s attention while the vice president carries out orders.’ ‘And gives them,’ added Bush’s close friend, Dick Cheney.
“George Bush, Jr. stood by his father and covered his backside whenever Bush would become incapacitated from drugs or required criminal backup. It appeared that Junior was there to serve both purposes while his father and Cheney enjoyed their work-vacation. Junior had never shown any interest in me sexually. Like his father, he had only shown sexual interest in [my daughter] Kelly, who had been away with him most of the day.”
Cathy told the Conspiracy Con audience that, at the age of 19, “I worked on a White House/Pentagon level during the Reagan/Bush years and carried out many criminal covert operations for the CIA. The war on drugs was no more than the CIA eliminating competition worldwide, turning our streets into a bloodbath. I was exposed to many drugs, perversion, sex activity, filmed through a little lens in the ceiling because these criminals do not trust each other, so they blackmail each other. I used cocaine, sometimes heroin, Bush’s drug of choice.
“Of all the drugs I was exposed to there was one that was strictly forbidden, and that was marijuana, because the effects on the brain actually opened those neuron pathways so that any compartmentalization of memory, of any kind of trauma, or so-called secret, actually begins to erode. That’s why they don’t want to have even medical marijuana. I’m not standing here to be pro-marijuana at all, I am here to tell you I am extremely anti-marijuana, but I know why this anti-marijuana campaign is out there, with their efforts to control all of us by making sure that this particular drug is controlled so that no one in any kind of position would have free thought.”
When Cathy finished her presentation, Mark Phillips returned to the stage. “We ask you respectfully,” he said, “to please allow us to provide you with”—that is, to sell—“our book and share it with someone you love. It’s a horrible book, probably the most incredible validated story that is going to soon be a major theme in maybe more than one motion picture and a TV documentary series. After all these years, Cathy and I believe that this is our last year.”
And therein lies a paradox of this convention. All the speakers totally distrust the controlled mainstream media, yet they all sense imminent triumph, believing that they and their messages will soon be vindicated by that very same controlled mainstream media.
You want statistics? Here’s what the polls show: That 68% of Americans believe President Kennedy was killed as part of a conspiracy. That 51% believe federal officials assassinated JFK. That 40% of Americans think the FBI set the fires at Waco. That more than four in ten Americans think the FBI deliberately withheld evidence in the Oklahoma City bombing case. That 80% of Americans think the government is concealing knowledge of extraterrestrial life. That 75% of Americans believe the war on drugs is a failure. That 47% of people using public toilets flush with their feet.

In a book about the National Security Agency, Body of Secrets, James Bamford reveals that, in 1962, U.S. military leaders proposed a plan to commit violent terrorist acts and kill innocent Americans, blaming Cuba in order to create a pretext for invading the island and deposing Fidel Castro. One document prepared and signed by all five Joint Chiefs or Staff, states: “We could develop a Communist Cuban terror campaign in the Miami area, in other Florida cities and even in Washington. We could blow up a U.S. ship in Guantanamo Bay and blame Cuba. Casualty lists in U.S. newspapers would cause a helpful wave of indignation.”
In an interview, Bamford said, “What the Joint Chiefs indicated in their plan was, they would have people shot on American streets, bombs blown up, refugee boats sunk on the high seas—and all this would be blamed on the Cuban government.”
I have no problem believing such insidious intentions—certainly the U.S. military commanders were capable of such dehumanization—and yet I can’t accept as truth Cathy O’Brien’s story. I think it’s an elaborate hoax, intertwining celebrity porn with historical context to foster credibility. Example: “Noriega had been an intricate part of arming the Nicaraguan contras for Reagan, as well as an international hub in the cocaine operations that funded the black budgets for ultra-secret projects such as Project Monarch.
“Michael Aquino put a vaginal prod in my hand and ordered me to masturbate myself with it, pushing the button to electrically jolt myself internally upon command. Noriega’s eyes were enormous. He paled to a sickly grey, his mouth fell open and he ran out the door while Aquino assured him that he had ‘nowhere to run, nowhere to hide from Reagan’s powers.’”
So who is this Aquino guy? According to Cathy, “In the early 1980s, my base programming was instilled at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, by U.S. Army Lt. Colonel Michael Aquino. He holds a Top Secret clearance in the Defense Intelligence Agency’s Psychological Warfare Division (PSYOP). He is a professed neo-Nazi, the founder of the Himmler-inspired satanic Temple of Set and has been charged with child ritual and sexual abuse at the Presidio Day Care in San Francisco. But like my father, Aquino remains ‘above the law’ while he continues to traumatize and program CIA-destined young minds in a quest to reportedly create the ‘superior race’ of Project Monarch mind-controlled slaves.”
I contacted Aquino, who retired in 1994, and he responded:
“Not only was I never stationed at Fort Campbell at anytime throughout my entire Army career, but I’ve never even visited that particular post, on- or off-duty. I have never had any contact at anytime, anyplace, anywhere with Cathy O’Brien. I have never programmed sex slaves for the government or anyone else. I have never participated in any form of child abuse whatever.”
What does he think her motivation is?
“I can only assume that O’Brien is either a crank or simply an unethical individual who seeks money, notoriety and/or publicity by inventing sensationalistic lies. Her book is strewn with sex accusations not just about myself, but concerning a parade of high government officials, celebrities and country music stars. I haven’t sued O’Brien for libel for the simple reason that her book is clearly in the lunatic fringe, and to take legal notice of it would only give it a dignity it doesn’t deserve. I presume that the other public figures libeled by it haven’t sued her either for the same reason.
“I certainly am not going to defend/excuse any of the MK-Ultra projects. These were all before my time—I was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant in 1968—and I read about such things in Search for the Manchurian Candidate and Acid Dreams, shaking my head, much the same as you probably did. I can affirm that my work in Army PSYOP was strictly legitimate and in keeping with the Field Manual #33-1 guidelines taught at the Special Warfare Center, Fort Bragg.
“In a nutshell: techniques for trying to convince an enemy not to fight but to cooperate with you. I originally became interested in it because (a) I believed that the USA was generally on the side of goodness, and (b) winning wars by persuasion rather than bullets and bombs seemed a great idea to me. This may sound like a naïve idealist, but that’s the way I looked out at the world in 1968.”
I asked Aquino, “Do you think that Cathy O’Brien and Mark Phillips utilized you in their book [published in 1995] because the Presidio case would give their accusations a patina of verisimilitude?”
“Well, I think that’s obvious,” he replied. “After the highly publicized and sensationalized attack on my wife and myself at the Presidio, all sorts of nutcases tossed my name around in whatever their fantasy of the moment. The combination--high-ranking Army officer, intelligence officer, Special Forces officer, PSYSOP officer, #2 official of the Church of Satan 1970-75+--was just too juicy.
“As for the Presidio affair, following the publication of the ‘recovered memories of Satanic Ritual Abuse’ book Michelle Remembers in 1980, the United States and other Anglo-American countries went through a decade of ‘Satanic Ritual Abuse scares and witch-hunts. After the 1984 McMartin Preschool became internationally publicized in one such scare, day-care facilities generally became targets of ‘Satanic Ritual Abuse’ witch-hunts.
“The epidemic extended to U.S. military services as well, including fifteen U.S. Army day-care centers and elementary schools by 1987. In late 1986 it was the turn of the Presidio. The San Francisco Police investigated, verified that my wife and I had been three thousand miles away in Washington, D.C.—where I was on duty every single day [that the alleged victim] was at the day-care center September 1st to October 31st, 1986—and closed the case with no charges accordingly.
“In October 1988, however, I appeared as a panelist on a Geraldo Rivera Halloween Special. Rivera was trying to aggravate and escalate the ‘Satanic Ritual Abuse’ witch-hunt mania, and I was speaking out against it. The broadcast came to the attention of Senator Jesse Helms who became enraged that a Lt. Colonel in the Army should dare to hold a ‘Satanic’ religion. As Freedom of information filings later revealed, Helms then secretly contacted his close personal friend, Secretary of the Army John Marsh, and insisted that Marsh devise some way to destroy my career. 
“What was actually taking place: a blatant attempt by Senator Helms, Secretary of the Army Marsh and the Criminal Investigation Division of the Army to discredit an Army officer with a ‘politically incorrect’ religion. It didn’t work.”
*   *   *
Although I believe that Trance Formation of America is an elaborate hoax and Michael Aquino thinks it’s in the lunatic fringe, conspiracy researcher Robert Sterling perceives a more devious motivation. In Apocalypse Culture II, edited by Adam Parfrey, Sterling writes:
“Effective disinformation is never an absolute lie. The purpose of disinformation is to confuse truth and validity, and to do so, boldfaced les are rarely convincing. Effective disinformation mixes truth and deception to obfuscate the two. The closer the disinformation approaches truth, the more damning it becomes. Then all the disinformation, even the legitimate parts, discredits targeted research and ideas.
“At the time of the release of Trance Formation, there was a growing awareness in the conspiracy subculture of intelligence agency involvement in satanic ritual abuse. Literature on the subject was reaching a critical mass where it could not be ignored. Would intelligence agencies devote resources to counteract such information? Not only is it possible, it almost certainly has occurred.
“The CIA, even with an officially acknowledged history of abusing people through mind-control experiments (the most famous being MK-Ultra), certainly has a vested interest in denying such operations exist, especially when the operations are as insidious as sexually abusing children. And supposing that [the] tales are part of a CIA disinformation campaign, it would make sense that some names on the list would actually include guilty participants. After all, what better place to hide the truth than out in the open, knowing full well it won’t be believed?”
Sterling posted a review of Cathy O’Brien’s book by Jaye Beldo on his Web site, The Konformist:
“If you are bored out of your mind with the usual Pamela Anderson Lee ‘power-fuck porn,’ I suggest grabbing a copy of Trance Formation of America and heading to the nearest bathroom with a jar of Vaseline. Why not infuse life into your worn-out sexual fantasies by envisioning some of the scenes spelled out in Cathy O’Brien’s supposed expose’ of the pedophile shenanigans of our Government officials? I mean, how could you not get excited over picturing Hillary Clinton going down on the author’s deformed vagina like a starved wolf while Bill walks in on them and casually ignores them? 
“I cannot help but get the impression that Cathy is, at times, really no different from some of the questionable UFO abductees making extravagant claims of being transported to other solar systems and back again. I have little doubt that some of the horrible things she mentions actually happen on a day-to-day basis. Completely denying them would be folly.”
Mark Phillips was not too thrilled with this review, and he wrote to Beldo:
“I feel compelled to inform you of the inevitable consequences of your unsolicited written vulgar assaults upon Cathy O’Brien, Kelly, myself and the overall integrity of our book. I have placed you on the shortlist of potentially dangerous sexual predators, which is automatically reviewed by interested local law enforcement personal [sic] (that we are in regular professional communications with) whenever a sexual crime is committed in the area you reside. Until you are apprehended for being a physical threat to yourself and/or innocent others, you will remain at large but nevertheless well identified.
“Stay away from contact with children and out of any county/state/federal prison system, as within moments from the time you may eventually be arrested for some alledged [sic] charge of illegal/immoral activities, I will be notified and will do all in my power of influence to see that you are legally seperated [sic] from society until you have had to time necessary to do what you proposed for others less appreciative of your sick ‘review’—to get a hold of yourself or allow an inmate to take matters into their own hands and change your thoughts towards acceptance of brutal criminal activity.”
Konformist editor Sterling wrote to Phillips:
“I harbored no personal animosity to either you or Ms. O’Brien, but I had serious questions about the accuracy of what was in your book. Even more disturbing, I had a very bad feeling that, wittingly or not, the claims in Trance Formation could easily be used to manipulate people into a hysterical witch-hunt state, and could be used to smear those who are innocent of charges made by you and Cathy, Brice and others. I felt if people were not careful, they could be whipped into a fascist state of mindlessly agreeing to any charge made by alleged CIA sex slaves to a conspiracy underground version of McCarthyism.”
The “Brice” he refers to is Brice Taylor, author of the first competitor of Trance Formation, published in 1999—Thanks for the Memories: The Memoirs of Bob Hope’s and Henry Kissinger’s Mind-Controlled Slave—in which she asserts that Walt Disney raped her on Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride; that she had sex with all three Kennedy brothers plus JFK, Jr. when he was 12; and that she has cavorted with public figures ranging from Prince Charles to Alan Greenspan, from Elvis Presley to Neil Diamond, from Johnny Carson to Ed McMahon. “Hi-yo!”
Brice Taylor also claims the existence of a federal program of brainwashing and molesting children with electroshock and dolphins, that she and her 13-year-old daughter had a threesome with Sylvester Stallone, and that he filmed them in Dolphin Porn, videos of dolphins penetrating women in the ocean. And Cathy O’Brien declares that “Jesuit/NASA-based whale and dolphin programming suggests that water is a mirror to other dimensions and is the means by which aliens have mixed with our population.”
Robert Sterling observes that, “After suffering horrible torture and abuse at the hands of countless famous politicians and celebrities, both O’Brien and Taylor declare of being spoken to by Jesus Christ, whose glorious powers healed them of all trauma and left them immune to further manipulation. At the time of her ‘memory recovery,’ Brice was corralled and influenced by Christian fundamentalists, who convinced her that her previous life was the prelude for an afterlife in Hell. It should be obvious that the New World Order sex slave genre is nothing more than thinly veiled porn disguised as parapolitics.”
Sterling told me that Cathy and Mark’s book has “sold over 20,000 copies. Their following is heavily right-wing Christians and patriot groups, and if you hang out with either sector you’ll eventually hear some pro-Trance-Formation-of-America sentiments. Not surprising—part of the book’s thesis is that mind control is part of the New World Order plot.”
The predecessor of this whole non-literary genre was The Control of Candy Jones, published in 1976. Jones was a highly successful model supposedly transformed into a CIA Manchurian Candidate. The book was ghostwritten by her husband, a carnival hypnotist and late-night radio talk-show host “Long John” Nebel. His friend, stage magician and psychic debunker James “The Amazing” Randi, told me that Nebel made up the entire book because he needed money. When I mentioned this to Walter Bowart, author of Operation Mind Control, he insisted that Randi himself was an intelligence agent. Amazing, indeed.

There’s a mini-ballroom at the Convention Center where conspiracy books, audio and videotapes are being sold. A man wearing a space suit is hawking an Alien Abduction Survival Kit. Another vendor is selling aura cameras. And, for some incongruous reason, a woman is coning—that is, getting the wax out of a prone client’s ears with the aid of a burning candle and a tin pie-pate. At a booth offering “Free Electricity for Life,” the proprietor is saying, “They killed one of my associates.”
In the auditorium, William Lyne, a researcher on free energy devices for 50 years, tells the audience, “I know a man who’s in mind control—and they’ve used it on him and his father—they use a virtual reality type of technology that’s projected to that person, transmitted to them so that they see images that aren’t there, but what they want to do is terrify them and make them think they’re seeing these things, except they’re intelligent people and they know that they’re not real images, they just want to know how they’re receiving those images. If they want you to see something, they can transmit it to you.
“They can do it for a whole area. And the place where this person lives, they’re all shutting down at 10 o’clock at night.  Everybody in that whole part of town are actually going to bed at the same time. It’s like they’ve got the whole area under control. And it’s within eyeshot of Los Alamos Labs. The dirty part of the labs where they do this kind of stuff. I say dirty because there’s coerced black projects being done out of there.”
	As for Lyne’s own safety in the face of promulgating free energy, he says, “I’m encouraged lately because there’s safety in numbers. Too many people have access to this stuff and are promoting it. Now there have been some real tragedies in the past. People had some of this technology and they disappeared or were squashed. I don’t have any fear of the government. I lost my fear a long time ago. They tried to murder me several times, and I said to myself, ‘Well, I might be dead tomorrow and nobody’d know why, so I’m gonna go out there and tell what I know and I’m not afraid,’ and I think everyone should take the same approach.”
Jordan Maxwell has been exploring the hidden foundations of religions and secret societies since 1959. At the convention, his presentation is titled Toxic Religion and the Occult Establishment. “The same people who gave you the Mafia gave you the Church,” he says. 
“The Church is the Mafia. An FBI man called me: ‘We’ve been watching you, we follow you wherever you go, we know what you’re doing. But you are not a threat. We admire what you’re trying to do. But your government does not consider you to be a threat—yet—but if you get enough people listening to you—and they’re not just listening but they’re actually hearing you—then you will be considered a threat and now we’ll have to take another look at what you’re going to do.
“‘But the reason I’m calling—this an unofficial call—is to warn you when you talk about corruption and government, most people in government couldn’t care less, they don’t care, they’re corrupt and they know it and you know it, so what are you gonna do about it? But when you talk about the Church and religious institutions in this country, what you’re doing is you are messing with organized crime at its highest level. The highest levels of organized crime in this country are the religious institutions. We’re talking about a lot of money. We’re talking about the control of men’s minds, about the dream of absolute total domination. This makes the Mafia look like child’s play.’”
Another speaker, Len Horowitz, author of Emerging Viruses: AIDS and Ebola, explains that “Non-lethal warfare is where you don’t kill populations like with a bomb or a gunshot, but you make them sick. You make them dependent on pharmaceuticals which are actually a military-pharmaceutical complex run by the same players—the global elite—and then ultimately these populations become enslaved to the pharmaceuticals and economically debilitated along with their nation states.”
Now, like the Blues Brothers, he on a mission from God: “Bust the Illuminati. Bust the cryptography code. The darkest time in our history is just beginning. Revelation tells you in God’s word that you and I should count the number of the Beast 666. The revelations we’ve just been given is that wisdom. It takes it out of the realm of foolish conspiracy theory into hard, provable, scientific, statistically significant fact, and God bless you with it at this time. With that blessing, I want to thank you so much for allowing me to be here tonight [it was now 12:30 in the afternoon]. Thank you. God bless you. Thank you [said nine times]. Say hallelujah! Praise God! Thank you all.”
Dr. Horowitz was scheduled to fly to Africa and spread the word. “Okay, God,” he prayed aloud, “if it’s not Your will for me to go—because apparently I’m hearing from all these people that I shouldn’t go, I shouldn’t go, fear, fear, fear, fear—please let me know what You want me to do, and if You have me go, if You choose to have me die if I go, then so be it, but I would prefer to live and carry your work forward, so please direct me.” And of course God told him to go. 
Yet another presenter, William Thomas, author of Chem-Trails: Mystery Lines in the Sky, also revealed a sense of his own martyrdom. He stated that “The earth and its inhabitants are being subjected to unprecedented experimentation without our knowledge or permission. Some say the chem-trails are intended to kill us all. Others insist the disorientation and lethargy resulting from chem-trail exposure are intended to make citizens compliant to the New World Order and enslave us all.
     “The most plausible explanation for massive aerial spraying is a planet-wide, high-tech campaign against catastrophic climate change. If true, such a desperate Band-Aid solution disregards fundamental causes of global warming in order to protect powerful financial interests by permitting pollution and profits. This story has cost me a lot--cost me the love of my life, my career. To the people doing this, you can break my heart and you can break my back, but you will never, ever, break my spirit.” [Prolonged applause, shouts of Bravo] “I’m not afraid of death.”
And the P.A. system blared forth the sound of Jackson Browne singing, “There are lives in the balance . . .”

If there is a star of this show, it’s David Icke (rhymes with bike). Author of And the Truth Shall Set You Free, he’s a dynamic performer, somewhat pot-bellied, with longish yellow hair. His presentation is about the secret manipulation of the human race, going back thousands of years, revealing how the same interbreeding bloodlines continue to control positions of power today, and he ardently shares suppressed information on humanity’s ancient extraterrestrial origins. Thus he offers an alternative explanation of our existence that transcends creationism and evolution alike.
All that, and he puts his underwear on backwards too. With his whimsical British accent, he confides to the audience: “A little while ago, I’m thinking I’ll empty me bladder before I speak, so I’m fiddling and I can’t make contact, and then I realize I put me underpants on the wrong way around. I didn’t know whether I was coming or going.” Then he entered specific domains of strangeness:
“A few years ago, I met a scientist who joined the CIA as a youngster, serving his country. He is a genius in the area of magnetics. When he started to work for the CIA in these secret projects, he realized that they didn’t want his knowledge to serve humanity, they wanted to create technology that would help to control the mass of the population, and he rebelled against it and said, ‘I’m not doing this any more.’
“He started to tell me a story and, as he did, he was opening his shirt. One day he left home and he started missing time. Doesn’t remember anything about it. But he does remember waking up on a medical-type bench, and as he got his faculties back he realized there was something stuck to his chest. As he opened his shirt, I could see like a see-through shampoo sachet on his chest with an orange-gold liquid inside it.
“And he said that what they’d done was manipulate his body to need this drug to survive, and if he doesn’t get it, then he starts to die what is apparently a very long and painful death. And this patch--which is what they call them on the inside--with the drug has to be replaced every seventy-two hours, and if he doesn’t serve an agenda that sickens him, then it’s not replaced.
“He told me about a microchip now so small it can be inserted in a vaccination program through a hypodermic needle. Even those who thought the microchip was coming along as a tagging device have not realized that it’s not just about keeping a tag on where people are. It’s not actually the signals going from the chip to the computer we should be concerned about, but the signals coming the other way to the chip, because the technology exists, outside the public arena and increasingly in it, which can manipulate human emotion and thought processes externally once one of these guys is inside. If people say no to one thing, say no to the microchip.”
(In December 2001, Reuters would report that a chip the size of a grain of rice which can be injected into your body and give detailed information to anyone with the right scanning equipment is soon to be available from Applied Digital Solutions. The company has projected a potential market worth $70 billion.]
Occasionally, Icke throws in a tidbit of comic relief, such as two Martians in a bar: “Have you heard the latest about the Earthlings?” “No, what have they done now?” “They borrow money that doesn’t exist and pay interest on it.”
Other times, he’ll throw in a generally unconsidered theory: “JonBenet Ramsey has all the feel of her being a multi-personality, dissociative identity disorder, trauma-based mind-control situation, and involved in satanic ritual abuse. I think there’s a massive cover-up there, because if you’re going to stop the dominoes falling, you have to stop the first domino falling, and that’s what that cover-up to me was all about.”
But he is most challenging when he discusses interbreeding: “Why are three ruling families today obsessed with interbreeding? Why when you follow them back genealogically to the ancient world have they always been obsessed with interbreeding? I found an amazing common theme in the ancient world anywhere on the planet—the theme of gods interbreeding with humanity, creating hybrid bloodlines which ended up in positions of power.
“I talked five hours with a Zulu shaman about extraterrestrial connections to the Illuminati. African history is the same theme, of gods from another world, which have great connections to earth history, interbreeding with humanity, creating bloodlines which have ruled the world all these thousands of years. The royal black bloodline of Africa from the age of tribal days claimed descendants from the same gods that these other crowds do.
“One of the great themes that comes up in this interbreeding and these ancient accounts is of a serpent race, a race of a reptilian genetic history, which interbred with humans, creating hybrid DNA. I’m not just talking about this tiny frequency range we call the world. There are other frequencies as well, in terms of where manipulators of the manipulators actually come from. This force which manipulates through these bloodlines overwhelmingly operates right on the periphery of our physical senses, right on the edge. It can appear that someone’s gone from one form to another. This is ‘shape shifting’ between human and reptilian form.
“From 1998 onward, I kept meeting people telling the same story, that they have seen people overwhelmingly in positions of power--but not always--move from a human form to a reptilian-type form. There is the Mayan legend of the iguana. Lizard-like aliens had descended upon the Mayans. Their pyramids—their advanced astronomical technology including the sacrifice of virgins—were supposedly inspired by lizard aliens. When the aliens interbred with the Mayans, they produced a form of life they could inhabit. They fluctuated between a human and iguana appearance in chameleon-like abilities, a perfect vehicle for transforming into world leaders.
“Those who have seen a reptilian-type ethereal figure enveloping and following around humans and locking into them in those lower two chakra points, vortex points, for me, is possession. The more I’ve understood this, the more I’ve realized just how many people, particularly these bloodlines, are actually controlled by these other-dimensional forces, and while we appear to be seeing a president or a banking leader in a physical form, the actual point of control is beyond that and overshadowing it, and on some occasion people see that overshadowing entity.”
One wonders whether such a defense—“The reptile made me do it!”—will some day be used in a court of law.
“To understand humanity,” Icke continued, “you have really got to understand humanists reptilian past, reptilian inherited genetics. One of the most ancient parts of the human brain is known by science as the R complex, for reptilian brain. We get these traits—cold-blooded behavior, ritualistic behavior, desire for top-down power over structures. Now, dismiss the reptilian thing—let’s just think they don’t exist—I have just described the basic mentality of the Illuminati that allows wars to be created, millions of casualties without any emotional attachment to consequences. Why do people who have more money than they could spend in a thousand lifetimes go on accumulating it? Why do corporations that have enormous power and control over vast areas go on accumulating and seeking more and more power and control?”
So, then, is this whole reptilian agenda really just a metaphor for the varieties of human cruelty? Or does Icke mean it all literally?
Previously, Jordan Maxwell had told the audience, “I think the dirtiest, the filthiest, the most licentious people on the face of the earth are the British royalty. They represent in the human race all that is evil and all that is filthy and degenerate. And that’s why Princess Diana is dead.” That there was a conspiracy behind Diana’s death seems to be a given among this crowd: the royal bloodline protected by the paparazzi. Conspiracy researchers often start with a premise—who benefits?—and work their way backward, molding their perception of reality like Silly Putty in order to culminate with the justification of that premise.
Maxwell continued: “About ten years ago, a young black man broke into the Queen Mum’s bedroom, and one of her servants happened to be walking by and the bedroom door was open a bit, and she saw this young black boy in the queen’s bedroom. She quietly went to security which came up and arrested him for breaking into the queen’s bedroom, but the queen said he didn’t threaten her and he wasn’t armed and it was just a childish silly prank, and so she let it slide if he promised not to do that any more. James Bond couldn’t break into the queen’s bedroom! If there was a young black man in the queen’s bedroom in Buckingham Palace, the queen ordered him in like pizza. The Queen Mum with her black boyfriend. Tell me about racism.”
That anecdote says something about the queen’s human nature, but now David Icke added another dimension:
“Some of the descriptions, like of the British royal family—people who claim to have been at the rituals—are of a literal shift. They seem to go from one physical state to another, very much in this dimension, which from our perspective of this-world physics is like, what? And then others are describing what appears to be a vibrational thing, where people are looking into another dimension slightly outside of our physical frequency range, the normal one, and suddenly they’re seeing another level of the person which appears reptilian. And exactly where the truth is in all that or whether it’s a shade of grey and both are true, there’s a lot more information that is needed.
“Going back in African history, this reptilian group actually go back a phenomenal amount of time in relation to this planet, and they claim that it’s actually rightfully theirs, and at some point in the ancient past there were some great wars that went on, and in fact they were kicked off, and they’re trying to regain control of what they think is rightfully theirs, like being kicked out of a country.
“Other researchers, concentrating on the reptilian thing for a long time, say that in some way they basically go around to different places, just raping the resources, and then move on. Then there’s the one about the fact that in some way a lot of these beings were almost imprisoned, in a vibrational prison, like they can’t get out of it by going up because they can’t vibrationally get there in their present state of being. And their only way out of that level is to come into a lower level of vibration into this dense physical world, and operate through that. But I understand Cathy saying it’s only a mind-control thing.”
From the gospel according to Cathy O’Brien:
 “When Bill and Bob Bennett together sexually assaulted my daughter Kelly and me at the Bohemian Grove in 1986, I had already known Bill Bennett as a mind control programmer for some time.  He apparently found perverse pleasure in whipping me. With my wrists bruised and my body stinking with pain, Bennett lit up a cigarette and cryptically asked, ‘Was that your first cum-union with an alien?’
“[On another occasion] deep underground in NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center mind-control lab near D.C., Bill Bennett began preparing me for the program. NASA uses various CIA designer drugs to chemically alter the brain and create exactly the mindset required at the time. I could barely crawl up onto the cold, metal lab table as the drug took effect in the darkness surrounding me, I could hear Bill Bennett talking. ‘My brother Bob and I work as one unit. We are alien to this dimension—two beings from another plane.’
“The high-tech light display swirling around me convinced me I was transforming dimensions with them. A laser of light hit the black wall in front of me, which seemed to explode into a panoramic view of a White House cocktail party—as though I had transformed dimensions and stood amongst them. Not recognizing anyone, I frantically asked, ‘Who are these people?’
“‘They’re not people, and this isn’t a space ship,’ Bennett said. As he spoke, the holographic scene changed ever so slightly until the people appeared to be lizard-like aliens. ‘Welcome to the second level of the underground. This level is a mere reflection of the first, an alien dimension. We are from a trans-dimensional plane that spans and encompasses all dimensions. I have taken you through my dimension as a means of establishing stronger holds on your mind than the earth’s plane permits. Being alien, I simply make my thoughts your thoughts by projecting them into your mind. My thoughts are your thoughts.’ If this were so, why did he have to audibly tell me?”
Aha! A touch of skepticism from Cathy. And yet part of me still hopes that was all true, if only because of Bill Bennett’s personal maxim: “Hypocrisy is better than having no values at all.”
*   *   *
How could I distinguish truth from lies if truth was cross-fertilized with greed, the need for attention, false memory, speculation, fantasy, self-delusion and intentional propaganda? I contemplated the implications of something that Michael Aquino had told me:
“Part of what we learned in PSYOP was that it’s not just the propaganda you create that is a factor, but the pre-existing propaganda ‘filters’ in target audiences’ brains as well. The key has to be designed to fit the lock, so to speak. And underlying all this is the challenge to the PSYOPerator to extricate himself from his own filters--otherwise he will see the situation only through his personal distortions and thus be inept at influencing it objectively and comprehensively.”
Consequently, propaganda can become a two-way street. For example, Cory Hammond, former president of the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis, has had many clients who, under hypnosis, “remember” hideous incidents of satanic rituals, infant sacrifice, sadomasochism and coprophilia (get that shit-eating grin off your face). Dr. Hammond believes that three groups working together—neo-Nazis, the CIA and NASA—have been programming American children for over fifty years to make them part of “a Satanic order that will rule the world.”
Likewise, the war on drugs is filtered through a mass of distortions. In the words of The Economist—a venerable British newsweekly that has been a longtime passionate advocate for the legalization of drugs—the growing, selling, consuming and outlawing of illegal drugs around the world is a complex mix of economics, politics and world culture.
There are silly conspiracies. Some folks believe that the moon landing was faked (those were close-up photos of oatmeal). Others believe that the Woodstock Festival never occurred (it was contrived by the media). Still others believe that Elvis Presley’s death was fabricated (he’s alive in Las Vegas, working as an Elvis impersonator). And surely there must be others who are convinced that militant vegetarian activists are responsible for Mad Cow disease.
Sometimes silly conspiracists get results. In 1995, Indiana transportation officials were forced to alter the maintenance codes marked on the back of highway signs because some state residents were convinced that the markings were coded messages designed to assist invading UN troops.
And there are serious conspiracies. Gasoline refiners conspire to limit supply and fix prices. The relationship between doctors and pharmaceutical companies is blatantly conspiratorial. Douglas Valentine wrote in The Phoenix Program (about the CIA’s notorious terrorist campaign against Vietnamese villagers) that in 1968 the Army’s 111th Military Intelligence Group kept Martin Luther King under 24-hours-a-day surveillance. Its agents were in Memphis on April 4th and “reportedly watched and took photos while King’s assassin moved into position, took aim, fired, and walked away.”
World War II was racketed by presidential conspiracies of silence: Franklin D. Roosevelt knew that Japan was going to attack Pearl Harbor; and Harry Truman knew that Japan was about to make peace overtures but he nevertheless ordered that atomic bombs be dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Domestically, the Aryan Republican Army financed and helped to stage the Oklahoma City bombing, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms knew about it three weeks before it happened.
Pokeman has become a target of religious leaders throughout the Arab world who charge that the game promotes theories of evolution, encourages gambling and, at its core, is part of a Jewish conspiracy aimed at turning children away from Islam. To David Icke, Jews are the pawns in an elaborate Rothschild-Illuminati breeding experiment, and they are “impregnated with a reptilian genetic code.”
*   *   *
There’s a final panel at Conspiracy Con with questions from the audience. A reporter for Stuff magazine waits his turn on line, then steps up to the microphone and asks, “What is the secret to how you’ve managed to maintain such healthy heads of hair? The answers: “Well, mine’s glued.” “I stopped pulling it out a few years ago.” “It was the fluoride.” “Mine is the same color when I purchased it.” And, “Genetics.”
A woman who claims to be a victim of mind control asks, “How do you function? How do you deal with manipulation in your personal lives, being individuals that are speaking out? Is there any secure communication? Can the whole body be scanned for implants, inside your teeth or your skull?”
Icke responds: “No technology exists in this frequency range more powerful than the human mind in its true power. When disconnected from that, we become open to technical manipulation. Is there any secure communication? I don’t give a shit. I say what I think on the Internet. I don’t worry about being harmed. If you don’t allow the idea of vulnerability into your reality, it cannot manifest. If it’s not your reality, you cannot project it. It never occurs to me that these guys can do anything to me.
“Those that were doing this [work] in fear of consequences were getting them. ‘I don’t know how long they’re gonna allow me to do this.’ They almost wore their bravery like a war medal. Courage is overcoming fear. If you don’t have fear you don’t need courage because there’s no fear to overcome. You just do it, get on with it, do what you believe to be right without the need for courage because there’s nothing to overcome.
“‘I’m doing dangerous things,’ they say, ‘but I keep on going. I’m sure they’re gonna do this to me if I keep on.’ They will get the consequences, and others who are just doing it, won’t. And because we create our own reality, what we allow into our field of possibility can manifest. If it doesn’t come it, it cannot manifest. I don’t worry about defending myself.”
Suddenly, as if on cue, an agitated man brandishing a pistol stalks out from the backstage area. Shouting, “The China card will be played big,” he aims his gun at Icke, who sits there calmly while the other panelists all duck under the table. A single shot rings out. Panic fills the air, and screams emanate from the audience. But it’s the would-be assassin, not Icke, who is the one that falls to the ground. The panel discussion has ended, and the auditorium is cleared.     
I show my press credentials to a security guard and he allows me to stay. I can see a doctor hovering over the man, who is bleeding fiercely. When the doctor unbuttons the man’s shirt I notice that on his chest, just a couple of inches from the gaping wound, there is a patch with an orange-gold liquid inside it. The doctor pats it gently and says, “What the hell is this?” The man is able only to whisper, “He blew my goddam cover.” Then he gasps for breath. The doctor says he’s dead, and the security guard tells me I have to leave.
I had been looking forward all day to a room-service dinner of Colossal Pacific Coast Prawns simmered in Thai curry sauce with sticky rice and toasted coconut, but now I wasn’t hungry. I was too preoccupied with what had transpired that evening. I kept asking myself, “Who shot the mad scientist? And why?” I felt like a poker player who’s been dealt a hand of all blank cards.
Finally an epiphany arrived, and I knew exactly what I had to do. I made three phone calls, then went down to the bar to keep an appointment with David Icke that we had arranged early in the day. We selected a corner table, I took out my cellphone, dialed my own number at home, and when the answering machine started, I dialed the code to get my messages and handed the phone to Icke. This is what he heard:
“Hi, this is Paul, calling myself. I’ve already left a message on [my wife] Nancy’s answering machine, asking her to save this tape in case anything happens to me. About the shooting that took place here, I called my contact in the CIA who informed me that it was a Company job. They killed David Icke’s friend before he could kill Icke. But why would they be protecting Icke? You’d think that they’d want him dead because he knows too much. Unless he happens to be one of them and they need him to continue spreading disinformation. So now that this precaution has been taken, I will go and confront Icke.”
He laughed.
“Nice try,” he said. “First of all, don’t worry, nothing’s going to happen to you. But, by all means, keep that tape as a souvenir. You’re right about one thing, though. I am protected by the CIA. Not because I’m one of them, but because I’m not one of them. If they wanted me dead, they could kill me any time they wanted. But they know I’m not spreading disinformation. You have to understand, these guys work strictly on a need-to-know basis. So it’s not that I know too much, it’s that they don’t know enough.
“Because, if an individual agent knows too much, he may not do what he’s been assigned to do. He must have a given order to do something, but if he knows that the end result is that somebody’s going to be blown up twelve miles away—and all he’s supposed to do is deliver an envelope—he may start thinking about it. So, various agents read my books and check my Web site and show up wherever I speak. It’s a safety valve for them, on how far things are going.”
“Are you saying that the intelligence community has allowed you to function because you know more than any of them?”
“Exactly . . .”
*   *   *
On my return fight the next morning, I found myself reminiscing about the 1987-88 TV season, when I had been a writer and on-air commentator on The Wilton North Report, a nightly satirical hour on the Fox network that lasted only 21 shows. Critics blamed the hosts, a pair of disc jockeys who were not untalented but who were deliberately chosen for their inoffensiveness.
I had previously suggested as host Conan O’Brien, a writer on the show who also did the audience warm-ups. “No,” said the producer, “he’s not professional enough.” Ellen DeGeneres? “Too dykey.” Chris rock? “Too raw.” Rosie O’Donnell? “Who wants to look at her every night?” Richard Belzer? “Too reptilian.” Belzer is a conspiracy researcher as well as a comedian and actor, but little did he ever dream that ultimately he—his reptilian self—could be the culmination of his own investigation.
Now, back home, the marketing of conspiracy was on a roll. Majestic, an interactive computer game revolving around a conspiracy involving corporate intrigue, was available. For $10 a month, tens of thousands of online players would receive screaming phone calls at midnight, faxes, anonymous emails and instant messages from mysterious informers directing them to research strange alien conspiracies and nefarious government activities. Majestic was suspended on September 12, 2001.
The invasion of the United States on September 11th was the mother of all conspiracies. Immediately there were those who began spinning scenarios of an inside job, an American version of the Reichstag Fire, carried out in order to justify the rise of a police state in the guise of security procedures. In any case, political opportunism has been providing the same results.
That Halloween, I was invited by producer Andy Meisler to be a panelist at the taping of a new TV series, The Conspiracy Zone. Although the plot behind the 9/11 terrorists was certainly a topic of conversation in the Green Room—“Do you think this is the endgame?”--the official subject that evening was the assassination of Robert Kennedy in 1968.
On the program, hosted by former Saturday Night Live cast member Kevin Nealon, I mentioned that Kennedy had once been on the Tonight show, telling Johnny Carson that cigarettes kill more people than marijuana, and I speculated that Sirhan Sirhan was a hired gun for the tobacco companies. On a more literal note, I talked about the ballistics Inconsistency; a total of ten bullets was found, though Sirhan’s gun could hold only eight.
And I discussed the fact that psychiatrist Bernard Diamond described in Psychology Today how, during the trial, post-hypnotic suggestion was used to program Sirhan into climbing the bars of his cell like a monkey. However, in the book RFK Must Die, Robert Kaiser, who was there, wrote: “Sirhan had no idea what he was doing up on the top of the bars. When he finally discovered that climbing was not his own idea, but rather Dr. Diamond’s, he was struck with the plausibility of the idea that perhaps he had been programmed by some else, in like manner, to kill Kennedy.”
There were two others on that TV panel, plus a separate segment with a dentist who practices hypnosis.
One panelist was Michael Ruppert, a former member of the Los Angeles Police Department, Narcotics Division, who became a prolific conspiracy researcher. Off camera, I asked what the turning point had been for him. He said that it was when his fiancée, a CIA operative, tried to involve him in drug smuggling, and he refused. Ruppert and I were both columnists for High Times then, but, he told me, “I don’t smoke grass.”
The other panelist was scheduled to be former Nixon speechwriter and now bespectacled, drone-voiced personality Ben Stein, but he canceled out at the last minute. Ann Coulter, former Justice Department attorney and Senate aide, now a professional reactionary and Stepford pundit, was at the studio for a subsequent taping about secret societies, and she was drafted into taking Stein’s place. A frequent guest on talk shows, Coulter is recognizable by her long blond hair, her short black skirt, and her drag-queen aura.
When she was a guest on CNBC’s The Big Idea, host Donny Deutsch asked her what an ideal country would be like, and she replied that it would be one in which everybody was a Christian. “We just want Jews to be perfected,” she said. As for Muslims, two days after the terrorist attacks on 9/11, she wrote in National Review Online, “We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity.” But now, the taping of The Conspiracy Zone had to be delayed because she was still in the makeup room.
“It takes a long time to turn Ben Stein into Ann Coulter,” I explained.
During a break in the show, I suggested to her that the labels “conservative” and “liberal” had become obsolescent, and I asked what she thought might be appropriate substitute labels.
 “Americans and cowards,” she said.
 “Yikes,” I replied.
On another occasion, I got a call from Conspiracy Zone producer Andy Meisler. The show was featuring debates about cover-ups, ranging from Freemasons to bar codes to Hollow Earth. “The frightening thing,” he observed, “is that life is so random. At least there’s something comforting about conspiracies.” He was calling me for recommendations as to who might be appropriate to appear on programs about the fix behind professional sports and the fix behind the election of George Bush. (The latter topic was discarded after 9/11.) He told me that the show would also deal with “unexplained deaths,” such as Jimmy Hoffa, Marilyn Monroe and the Kennedys.
“Oh, that’s so last century,” I said. “Conspiracy research has evolved from ‘Who Killed JFK?’ to ‘Who Fucked a Lizard From Outer Space?’”
One other thing. My visual mantra of the man who urinated and flossed simultaneously was replaced by a patriotic image of Cathy O’Brien: “I was ushered away from my classmates,” she said, “and taken to an office where Michigan State Senator Guy VanderJagt was waiting with soon-to-be-president Gerald Ford. They laughed as he placed a small American flag in my rectum and instructed me to wave it.” Like all politicians, though, Ford merely wrapped himself in the American flag.

Swimming in the Dead Pool

When Ken Kesey’s son Jed was killed in an accident--the van carrying his University of Oregon wrestling team had skidded off a cliff--I immediately flew to Oregon. “You were his favorite,” Kesey said as we embraced, sobbing. “I feel like every cell in my body is exploding,”
A few days later, several of us old friends were sitting around the dining-room table there, and someone mentioned that the Dead Kennedys were on tour.
“I wonder if Ted Kennedy is gonna go see ’em,” I remarked.
Kesey, standing in the kitchen, responded, “That’s not funny.”
“You’re right. I apologize. It’s not very abstract right now.”
“It’s never abstract.”
I recalled that little dialogue as I began to explore The Game, now in its 34th year [2004], the longest-running dead pool in America, currently with 125 players. Before January 1st everyone submits 68 names of people who might die that year. (Dr. Death, co-founder of The Game, liked to work on a legal pad--34 lines, two columns, hence 68 names.) Points are awarded according to the age of each dead person--anybody in their 50s is worth five points; 60s, four; 70s, three.
Each participant gets one wild card per year worth five points no matter how old the deceased. Gamesters generally pick one-pointers for their wild card to get four extra points. Last year, most picked Bob Hope. When he died, one Gamester said, “My father was shot during World War II. While recuperating in England, Mr. Hope came up to his bedside and stuffed a half-dozen golf balls into his [own] mouth. It cheered my old man up.”
Deaths become official when mentioned in the New York Times or any two major newspapers. One player “is extremely frustrated,” I was told. “He has Idi Amin, who is on life support in a Saudi hospital. Now there have been death threats, and armed guards have been posted.” Since the listees are all on various rungs on the ladder of celebrityhood, The Game is understandably rife with abstraction.
“After all, the dead pool has probably been around since the phenomenon of fame itself,” write Gelfand and Wilkinson in the book Dead Pool. “It has certainly been around as long as gallows humor has. In the heyday of hard-boiled journalism (the Front Page days of the 1930s), reporters who covered a country ravaged by organized crime and engaged in a world war found respite in the dark humor of the dead pool. Even before the Internet, the dead pool was slowly emerging from the shadows of our culture.”
As with dead pools, ranging from business offices to Howard Stern’s radio show, that book is a guide to profiting from money bets. But members of The Game play solely for the fun of it. Whoever has the most points at the end of the year wins--“bragging rights only”—slightly ironic since Gamesters (lawyers, ad people, educators, psychology professors, writers, everyday working folks) all play under aliases like Frozen Stiff, Fade to Black, Worm Feast, Decomposers, 2 Dead Crew, Johnny B. Dead, Wm. Randolph Hearse, Daisy Pusher, Silk Shroud, Necrophiliac Pimp, Legion of Doom, Gang Green, Habeas Corpse, Die-Uretic, Shovelin’ Off, Blunt Instrument, Rig R. Mortis, Flatliners, Unplugged, Toe Tag, Clean Underwear and Gratefully Dead.
One couple, the Moorebids, insist, “We play for honor, not bragging rights. It has to do with honoring who you get the hit on.”
Another player told me, “I compare playing The Game to my day job, science. We do a lot of data collection and data analysis; play our hunches. Our reward is not financial, but peer recognition. One selects some names to acknowledge the person. Other names are selected because earning you points is their last opportunity to do something productive and honorable in their otherwise useless life. My most missed hit was Spiggy [Nixon’s disgraced vice president, Spiro] Agnew; I was distressed at missing him.”
Each Gamester pays $10 to Pontius, official coordinataor and editor, to keep score and report the hits. There are players in over 30 states (23 in New York), plus one each in Quito, Kuwait, England and Australia. You can become a Gamester only by being recommended by another Gamester. They’re mostly baby boomers, attracted by a whimsical, informative style of reporting.
Forty-nine Gamesters “hit” Buddy Ebsen. Obituaries mentioned that after ten days of filming The Wizard of Oz, Ebsen fell ill because of the aluminum make-up on his skin, and was replaced as the Tin Man by Jack Haley. (A suspicious player wondered, “Did Jack Haley add something to the aluminum make-up at the Wizard set?”) Conversely, there have been “solo’s” on the unexpected demise of Princess Diana and JFK, Jr.
“A solo I am proud of,” one Gamester told me, “is the hit on Christian Nelson, who invented the Klondike Bar.”
“Yes, it’s sick,” another player admitted, “but c’mon, it’s just a game! The Game is a light-hearted way of spitting in death’s eye--your opportunity to pick a Generation-X rock star who OD’s on heroin, a geriatric blue-hair who finally kicks the bucket, a fascist totalitarian in the Mid-East who is assassinated. I’m not doing great this year because I invested too heavily in Hamas, but I’m still in the top ten. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is doing its job--I just guessed wrong. Last year I scored on Khattab, a Chechnian rebel leader who was killed by a letter he opened that was poisoned. Our first poison-pen-letter death.”
But isn’t it somewhat ghoulish?
“Ghoulish?” a participant replied. “No more so than fantasy baseball. We can get up in the morning, and either pick up the newspaper or turn on the Internet to see if we scored, every day. It’s like baseball stats, you want to move up in the standings of the veterans. The reason we Gamesters play, I would say it’s about style. Style involves who you pick. Some concentrate on music, some on politics, some on sports.”
As for social significance, one player explained that “The pastime has been going on for more than four hundred years, so I don’t think it’s reflective of any given time or society. Every Gamester comes with their own perspective. The Game is irreverent, even a bit shocking, and some take pleasure in that. It’s a poke to the ribs that lie beneath stuffed shirts, a tweak of bluenoses. The Game is a competition—challenging, engaging and energizing. The Game heightens awareness and helps us to recognize our kinship with those whose deaths we note. The Game is a way of sharing and staying in touch with friends, whether near or far. It gives people a reason to call and correspond.”
Pontius’s predecessor, Ghostwriter, had thanked many folks in his farewell message, including “Persephone, who enabled me to say, ‘Yes,’ when a friend here in Central New York said, ‘Do you know a good adoption lawyer in Arkansas?’ It was my greatest cameo role, my finest hour as a networker, and I couldn’t have done it without The Game and this wise, wonderful woman.”
The Game’s listserv emails are titled “It’s a Hit!” They can be poignant, respectful, even sentimental: “July 4th—A score of swaying Gamesters were heard singing ‘I Can’t Get Enough of Your Love, Babe’ as each collected a five-note from velvety-voiced singer Barry White . . .”
Or they can sound like a warhorse race: “July 22nd—Mosul, Iraq. Qusay and Uday, the brutal and powerful sons of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, were ambushed by Special Forces and the 101st Airborne that resulted in a deadly four-hour firefight. Enjoying the best day of his career was Tomb Essence who had a 14-point Daily Double . . .”
But The Game giveth and the Game taketh away: “August 21st—British and American armed forces in Iraq announced today that they had arrested Ali Hasan al-Majid, aka Chemical Ali. Back in April 2003, the British armed forces announced they had killed him. Tomb Essence celebrated then, but is crying like a baby now.”
Animals have also been “scored,” from Morris the Cat to Dolly the cloned sheep to Keiko the killer whale. Choices can get personal, though. A player told me, “I purposely Left off a good friend [former New York Post editor Jerry Nachman] who I knew was dying, and one of our game mates refused to list a friend’s [famous] mother who knew she was dying. Sometimes we just don’t want to ‘cash in’ on our friends’ pain. How un-American of us.”
Gamesters have scored on all the Kennedys as well as Lorraine Petersen, the model on the Sunmaid Raisins box. But, under the title “It’s Not a Hit!” came this email: “August 9 th—The entire Game failed to list dancer and actor Gregory Hines, 57.” In The Game’s 2001 Hit List, under the subhead “Other Notable Deaths That No One Picked,” included was “Ken Kesey, 11/1201, author, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.”
I had a visceral reaction. This was not abstract.
“I never could decide if leaving Kesey off my list was the right thing to do,” one Gamester told me. “The Merry Pranksters obviously inspired my non de plume, the Bury Pranksters.”

Trashing the Right to Read

Before Kenneth Foster’s death sentence was revoked at the last minute in August 2007, he had read a book, Welcome to the Terrordome, and he wrote a letter to the author, Dave Zirin:
I have never had the opportunity to view sports in this way. And as I went through these revelations I began to have epiphanies about the way sports have a similar existence in prison. The similarities shook me.  Facing execution, the only thing that I began to get obsessive about was how to get heard and be free, and as the saying goes, you can’t serve two gods.

Sports, as you know, becomes a way of life. You monitor it, you almost come to breathe it. Sports becomes a way of life in prison, because it becomes a way of survival. For men that don’t have family or friends to help them financially, it becomes a way to occupy your time. That’s another sad story in itself, but it’s the root to many men’s obsession with sports.

Zirin writes, “It didn’t matter if he was on death row or Park Avenue, I felt smarter having read his words.  But even more satisfying was the thought that thinking about sports took his mind--for a moment--away from his imminent death, the 11-year-old daughter he will never touch, and the words he will never write.  I thought sending him my first book, What’s My Name, Fool?: Sports and Resistance in the U.S., would be a good follow-up.”
But a form titled “Texas Dept. of Criminal Justice, Publication Review” was banned from Death Row because “It contains material that a reasonable person would construe as written solely for the purpose of communicating information designed to achieve the breakdown of prisons through offender disruption such as strikes or riots.”  Two pages were specifically mentioned.
Page 44 includes a quote from Jackie Robinson’s autobiography referring to the blatant racism he suffered early in his rookie season: “I felt tortured and I tried to just play ball and ignore the insults but it was really getting to me.  For one wild and rage-crazed moment I thought, ‘To hell with Mr. Rickey’s noble experiment.  To hell with the image of the patient black freak I was supposed to create.’  I could throw down my bat, stride over to that Phillies dugout, grab one of those white sons of bitches, and smash his teeth in with my despised black fist.  Then I could walk away from it all.”
And page 55 includes a passage about Jack Johnson’s defeat of the “Great White Hope,” Jim Jeffries: “Johnson was faster, stronger and smarter than Jeffries.  He knocked Jeffries out with ease.  After Johnson’s victory, there were race riots around the country in Illinois, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Texas and Washington, D.C.  Most of the riots consisted of white lynch mobs attacking blacks, and blacks fighting back.  This reaction to a boxing match was one of the most widespread racial uprisings in the U.S. until the 1968 assassination of civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.”
Zirin points out that “There was a time in Texas when it was illegal to teach slaves to read.  The fear was that ideas could turn anger often directed inward into action against those with their boots on black necks.  It is perhaps the most fitting possible tribute to Jackie Robinson and Jack Johnson that they still strike fear into the hearts of those wearing the boots.”
In the Dallas County jail, one of the largest in the country, all publications are refused, including daily newspapers such as the Dallas Morning News.  “They seem to have a rather callous disregard for the Constitution,” said Paul Wright, publisher of Seattle-based Prison Legal News, with a circulation of 9,000.  He filed a federal lawsuit challenging the ban on First Amendment grounds, and won.  His lawyer, Scott Medlock, prisoner rights attorney with the Texas Civil Rights Project, points out that some jails have argued that prisoners can watch TV news in jail, so they don’t need access to publications.
Prison Legal News is also preparing a lawsuit against the Utah Department of Corrections for a policy that bars all books except those that are shipped directly from Barnes & Noble.  Generally, prisons require that books be sent directly from the publisher or a major distributor, for security reasons.  Otherwise, a spokesperson for one jail explains, “There’s a possibility something could be in one of the pages that we don’t want.  There could be little bits of drugs in the pages.”
“We have not yet sued them.” Wright told me, “since they only sporadically censor us and aren’t letting us develop a good fact pattern.”
A spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said that its jails allow inmates to receive books from booksellers after checking to see whether they can be fashioned into a weapon, promote violence or have sexually explicit content.  Across the country, only paperbacks are accepted.  Hardcovers are rejected because they provide “source material” for fashioning weapons.  When the Supreme Court ruled that law libraries did not have to be provided to prisoners, jails in Montana not only removed the entire contents of the law library, but they also removed the typewriters.
Washington State has tried to keep Prison Legal News itself out of prisons.  First, the Department of Corrections prohibited inmates from receiving nonprofits.  PLN sued and won.  Next, the state issued a rule that inmates couldn’t receive publications that were paid out of their trust accounts.  PLN managed to get that rule overturned too.  Then the prisons adopted a policy of not delivering subscription-renewal notices.  PLN took that to court and succeeded in getting the policy reversed.  PLN has won similar lawsuits or settlements in Alabama, California, Michigan, Nevada and Oregon.
	While serving five years in a California prison for growing medical marijuana, Todd McCormick contributed a couple of stories--about his experiences with psilocybin and ketamine--to my anthology, Magic Mushrooms and Other Highs: From Toad Slime to Ecstasy, and when it was published, I immediately sent him a copy.  But the warden rejected it “because on pages 259-261, it describes the process of squeezing toads to obtain illicit substances which could be detrimental to the security, good order and discipline of the institution.”
This was pure theater of cruelty.  Federal correctional facilities do not have a toad problem, and outside accomplices have not been catapulting loads of toads over barbed wire fences to provide the fuel for a prison riot. McCormick wrote to me, “Can you believe this shit!  I wonder how much we pay the guy/girl who actually sits and reads every book that comes in for offending passages.  How about you tear out pages 259-261 and re-send this book back with a copy of the rejection and a notation that the offending pages have been removed.”
Which is exactly what I did.  This time, though, my cover letter to the warden was ignored, and the book was returned, stamped “Unauthorized.”  I had called their bluff.  Obviously, McCormick was being punished simply because he could be.  I then corresponded with several prison correspondents around the country to find out what inmates had not been allowed to read.  I wanted to see other examples of arbitrary and frivolous censorship by prison personnel.  Here are some results of my informal survey:
*“The Texas Department of Corrections blocked Bo Lozoff’s Breaking Out of Jail, a book about teaching meditation to prison inmates.”
*“Disallowed: Trainspotting because of its ‘glorification of drug use.’  Tom Robbins’ Still Life With Woodpecker because it has a chapter that ‘contains information about bombmaking.’”
*“An inmate couldn’t get nude pictures of his wife sent to him but he could get a subscription to Playboy.  The rationale: A wife deserved more respect.”
*“They kept out The Anarchists Cookbook. And no kiddie porn, no tales or photos suggesting sex with a guard, no photos showing frontal or rear nudity--not even a wife or friend.”
*“The Utah prison system banned Rolling Stone as being an anarchist publication.”
*“A Revolution in Kindness is banned from the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola as ‘a threat to internal security.’  It was intended for Herman Wallace, who contributed an essay about how he organized a chess tournament on his cellblock as a way of easing tensions and minimizing violence between inmates.  Wallace is one of the Angola Three, Black Panthers who have been in solitary confinement for [more than three decades] trying to improve conditions in the ‘bloodiest prison in America’ in the early 1970s.”
*“All hardback books forbidden, because the covers could be fashioned into weapons.  Educational textbooks--a new rule precludes prisoners on Death Row [including this particular prisoner] or in lockdown from taking correspondence courses--and I’ve had a couple of books returned to sender on the claim they appeared to be for a course.  MAPS [Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies]--their publication was sent back several times because maps are not allowed in here.  High Times was repeatedly denied because it posed a danger to the safe, secure and orderly operation of the institution.  ‘Smut mags’ like Hustler are reviewed monthly.”
*“There’s a whole new genre of men’s magazines--Maxim, Stuff, For Him--which show it all except for nipples and beaver.  Now the feds want to ban Maxim due to ‘security’ reasons.  The ‘rejected mail’ slip they send you when some verboten material arrives has boxes to check (to specify offending matter), one of which says ‘pubic hair.’”
*“Peace activist William Combs spent eight days in solitary confinement for receiving and sharing with other inmates what federal authorities consider disruptive, if not subversive, political literature.  The offending ‘propaganda’ included commentary by such extremists as Bill Moyers and Ellen Goodman, and included an article published in Reader’s Digest.  The common thread was that they all questioned the wisdom of government policy.”
     The name of the game is control in the guise of security--a microcosm of the nation outside prison walls--the practice of power without compassion.
After Magic Mushrooms and Other Highs was rejected for the second time, I appealed to the Regional Director of the Bureau of Prisons (as instructed by the warden) for an independent review.  I also wrote to the ACLU.  I heard back from neither. Todd McCormick was released from prison in December 2003.  Among so many other things to catch up on, he would finally be able to read what he had written.  However, he was discharged to a halfway house, where all his books and magazines were confiscated as “paraphernalia.”
Postscript: Prisoners at a jail in South Carolina are being denied any reading material other than the Bible. In May 2011, the ACLU asked a federal judge to block enforcement of that policy. A staff member at the prison told plaintiff Prison Legal News: “Our inmates are only allowed to receive soft back bibles in the mail directly from the publisher. They are not allowed to have magazines, newspapers, or any other type of books.” There is no library there, and since 2008, all copies of Prison Legal News that were sent to prisoners have been “returned to sender.”
In July 2017, the national Human Rights Defense Center organization has filed a federal lawsuit against the Kentucky Department of Corrections for violating free speech. It has unconstitutionally blocked the delivery of many books to state prisoners, including the Prisoner Diabetes Handbook, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary of Law, and the Prisoners Self-Help Litigation Manual. 
Welcome to Camp Mogul

My irreverent friend, Khan Manka, Chairman & CEO of Manka Brothers Studios, had broken his ankle and was afraid he wouldn’t be able to attend the 26th annual gathering of the nation’s most powerful executives and their trophy wives in Sun Valley, Idaho.  I really wanted to spy on this 2008 summer camp for billionaires, so I suggested that Manka get a wheelchair, then I could serve as his official wheelchair pusher, and he immediately went for the idea.
	This by-now traditional five-day extravaganza for three hundred guests was hosted by Wall Street investment banker Herbert Allen, President and CEO of Allen & Company.  There were moguls all over the campground, overflowing with the country’s most influential leaders in business, entertainment and media.  I could feel myself developing a severe case of imposter syndrome.
Saturday was Talent Night, and it was absolutely hysterical.  Part-time Sun Valley resident Tom Hanks served as the emcee.  Warren Buffett was the opening act, performing a medley of Jimmy Buffett songs, all rendered out of tune.  Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos skillfully juggled five Kindles (wireless electronic books).  Edgar Bronfman from Warner Music--dressed like the character Tevya in Fiddler on the Roof--sang with zest, “If I Were a Rich Man.”  Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang--who had previously turned down an offer from Microsoft to buy Yahoo--sang a duet with the ex-CEO of Microsoft, Bill Gates, harmonizing on a song from Annie Get Your Gun, “Anything You Can Do, I Can Do Better.”  Meg Whitman of EBay did a striptease, auctioning off each item of clothing, one at a time, and over 3 million dollars was raised for an unnamed charity.  Oracle Corp. CEO Larry Ellison gave a hilarious lecture on “How to Destroy Evidence and Make False Statements.”
There had been a lot of drinking in the evening, and it was obviously too much booze that loosened up Fox mogul Rupert Murdoch’s tongue.  He was shouting at the moon: “Who says there are twenty-seven million slaves around the world?  And where the fuck can I get one?  How would anybody know it’s twenty-seven million anyway?  Do they have census takers or what?  You tell me!  I’ll decide!”
Also, a screaming match broke out between Google co-founder Sergei Brin and Google CEO Eric Schmidt, over the infamous cover of the New Yorker, which depicted Barack and Michelle Obama as the new President and First Lady, a terrorist couple doing that fist-bump gesture in the Oval Office.  Sergei thought it was a brilliant satirical illustration, but Eric thought it was racist and irresponsible.
Last year, the surprise guest was former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.  This year, it was Steven Beschloss, the editor of a new magazine, scheduled to be launched in October 2008 and be delivered to 100,000 U.S. households with an average net worth of $25 million.  There were piles of preview copies scattered about.
While Beschloss was holding court in an outdoor area, annoying mosquitoes kept buzzing around the crowd.  Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, yelled at him, “I guess we’ll never hear your readers whining about a mental recession.  And those of your subscribers who were in the sub-prime mortgage industry--these mosquitoes are their fault, because, along with all the home foreclosures they’re responsible for, the stagnant water in abandoned pools turns into new breeding grounds for mosquitoes.”
Someone yelled out, “Where are you from, In-Your-Facebook?”  Others drowned out Zuckerberg’s apparently serious rant by singing the mogul version of a couple of good old-fashioned camp songs, “This Land Is My Land, This Land Is My Land” and “KumBuyYahoo.”   I couldn’t help but notice that billionaire activist Carl Icahn snapped his fingers as if having an epiphany; a week later he ended up on Yahoo’s board of directors.
Khan Manka explained that the bigwigs at these events have so-called “informal” meetings which always take place where a pair of individuals can have their discussions alone without any interruption--on the golf course, hiking along an isolated trail, fly-fishing at Silver Creek--but Manka had been privy to only one specific example that he could share.
“Back in 1995,” he told me, “Disney honcho Michael Eisner met with Robert Iger, who was then the head of ABC.  And exactly one month later, these two giant companies merged into one media megamonster.  Coincidence?  I don’t think so.  Their deal had been sealed when Eisner and Iger exchanged friendship bracelets that they had worked on at Camp Mogul.”










HIGHER THAN THOU

Checkmating With Pawns

It was a hot day at the chess tournament in Phoenix, Arizona—103 degrees, to be exact—and 14-year-old Nathaniel Dight was elated over his custom-made chess set. Those carved wooden pieces had been weighted precisely for the smooth moves he liked to make. Each one had been lacquered and, for this extreme heat, carefully protected by matte acrylic spray. But before the game could begin, young Nathaniel was ordered to take a urine test.
“I know why you’re doing this,” he snarled. “It’s because I’ve won three tournaments in a row, isn’t it?”
“No, son, that’s just a coincidence. This is a random drug test.”
“I don’t do any drugs. I mean like when I get a headache from playing chess too long, I won’t even take an aspirin.”
“Look, here’s a cup. I need you to go fill it, right now . . .”
All right, I confess, I made all that up, but consider the implications of something that I haven’t made up:
America’s drug czar, Barry McCaffrey, wrote in an article published in Chess Life magazine: “Research proves that mentoring youngsters and teaching them games like chess can build resilience in the face of illegal drug use and other destructive temptations. Drug testing is as appropriate for chess players as for shot-putters, or any other competitors who use their heads as well as their hands.”
Accompanying the television image of a couple of eggs sizzling in a frying pan, the phrase, “This is your brain on drugs” has always carried negative connotations, but apparently General McCaffrey has changed his mind about that. He now seems to believe that drugs can actually improve the way your brain functions.
There was an infamous chess player named Alexander Alekhine who held the world championship longer than anybody else. His games often had superb surprise endings, known in chess circles as “brilliancies.” For instance, he would checkmate with a pawn move that no sane and sober mind could ever imagine. However, he was a notorious alcoholic, and McCaffrey is only referring to illegal drugs.
“Just when I thought I’d heard it all from McCaffrey,” was the reaction of Allen St. Pierre, executive director of the NORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) Foundation. “Drug testing for chess players? What’s next from this overreaching drug czar? Drug testing for tiddlywinks players? How about bingo players?”
Moreover, McCaffrey’s proposal smacks of subliminal racism. Social psychologist Walli Leff tells me, “I think most of the movement to involve young people in chess is directed toward the African-American community, and the assumption is, if the kids are black they’re going to be drug users. I think white middle-class suburban parents would have a fit if their kids had to take drug tests for their extracurricular activities. Or am I out of it and am I missing a new, white middle-class suburban submissiveness?”
McCaffrey had been influenced by Chesschild, a group sponsored by the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP). Chesschild is a substance abuse prevention program conducted in libraries and schools, promoting a combination of drug-free lifestyles and chess.
“Policy recommendations like this one from ONDCP,” said St. Pierre, “demonstrate a deep and disturbing pathology that goes well beyond opposing drug-law reform efforts.”
Maybe the drug-law reformers should follow the example of gay-rights activists by having celebrities come out of the pot-smoking closet. Already, veteran stand-up comic George Carlin—in an interview by The Daily Show’s Jon Stewart following Carlin’s HBO special—admitted that he smokes a joint to help him “fine-tune” his material. “One hit is all I need now and it’s punch-up time.”
At the Shadow Convention that took place while the Democrats were in Los Angeles, Bill Maher revealed to the audience, “I’m not just a pot reformer, I’m a user”—something which ABC forbids him to say on Politically Incorrect—then quickly added, “Just making a light remark there, federal authorities.”
Actor and hemp activist Woody Harrelson has stated, “I do smoke.” Willie Nelson confirmed in his autobiography that he smoked pot in the White House. And on KRLA, radio talk-show host Michael Jackson’s program, Michelle Phillips, actress and former member of the Mamas and the Papas, said that she still enjoys smoking marijuana.
Just as Ellen DeGeneres appeared on the cover of TIME magazine saying, “Yep, I’m gay,” there might come a day when a presidential candidate will appear on the cover of Newsweek saying, “Yep, I’m stoned.” Isn’t that what young pot-smokers need—good role models—so they won’t be ashamed of their private pleasure seeking?
Meanwhile, drug czar McCaffrey would continue his crusade, not only against illegal substances, but perhaps also against certain food supplements, such as a popular herbal mixture with a reputation for aiding memory and concentration. Who could ever have dreamed that chess players might get in trouble for using ginkgo biloba as a performance enhancer?


Tim Leary, Ram Dass, and Me

     In 1964, I assigned Robert Anton Wilson to write a front-cover article in The Realist, which he titled “Timothy Leary and His Psychological H-Bomb.” When that issue was published, Leary invited me to visit the Castalia Foundation, his borrowed estate in Millbrook, New York.
     The name Castalia came from The Bead Game by Herman Hesse, and indeed, the game metaphor permeated our conversation. Leary talked about the way people are always trying to get you onto their game-boards. He discussed the biochemical process “imprinting” with the same passion that he claimed he didn’t believe anything he was saying, but somehow I managed to believe him when he told me that I had an honest mind.
“I have to admit,” I said, “that my ego can’t help but respond to your observation.”
“Listen,” he assured me, “anybody who tells you he’s transcended his ego . . .”
     Leary and his research partner, Ram Dass (then Richard Alpert) were about to do a lecture series on the West Coast. At the University of California in Berkeley, there was an official announcement that the distribution only of “informative” literature (as opposed to “persuasive” literature) would be permitted on campus, giving rise to the Free Speech Movement, with thousands of students protesting the ban in the face of police billy clubs.
Leary argued that such demonstrations played right onto the game boards of the administration and the police alike, and that the students could shake up the establishment much more if they would just stay in their rooms and change their nervous systems. But it wasn't really a case of either-or. You could protest and explore your 13-billion-cell mind simultaneously.
     I became intrigued by the playful and subtle patterns of awareness that Leary and Alpert manifested. If their brains had been so damaged, as mythologized by mainstream media, how come their perceptions were so sharp? I began to research the LSD phenomenon, and in April 1965 I returned to Millbrook for my first acid experience. Tim Leary was supposed to be my guide, but he had gone off to India.
     Dick Alpert was supposed to take his place, but he was too involved in getting ready to open at the Village Vanguard as a comedian-philosopher. I chatted with him for a while. He was soaking his body in a bathtub, preparing his psyche for the Vanguard gig. He had taken 300 acid trips, but there I was, a first-timer, standing in the open doorway, reversing roles and comforting him in his anxiety about entering show business.	When I told my mother about taking LSD, she was quite concerned. She warned me, “It could lead to marijuana.” And she was right. It did. 
     After Leary got arrested in Texas for possession of pot, the notoriety of his research in Millbrook spread. Law enforcement in nearby Poughkeepsie, led by Assistant District Attorney G. Gordon Liddy, raided the estate. In the summer of 1966, Leary and his associates ran a two-week seminar on consciousness expansion, culminating in a theatrical production of Hesse's Steppenwolf legend that weaved its way around the Millbrook grounds and buildings. Leary invited Liddy and members of the grand jury that indicted him, but none showed up.
Leary told me about prominent people whose lives had been changed by taking LSD: actor Cary Grant, director Otto Preminger, think-tanker Herman Kahn, Alcoholics Anonymous founder Bill Wilson, TIME magazine publishers Henry and Clare Boothe Luce. Of course, it wasn't so difficult to drop out when you had such a stimulating scene to drop into. On the day that he announced the formation of a new religion, the League for Spiritual Discovery (LSD), I signed up as their first heretic.
Alpert and I enjoyed what he called “upleveling” each other with honesty. On one occasion, we were at a party. I was particularly manic and he pointed it out, choosing an eggbeater as his analogy. I appreciated his reflection and calmed down.
     On stage at the Village Theater, Alpert was sitting in the lotus position on a cushion, talking about his mother dying and how there seemed to be a conspiracy on the part of relatives and hospital personnel alike to deny her the realization of that possibility. He also talked about some fellow in a mental institution who thought he was Jesus Christ. Conversely, I teased him about discussing his mother openly but concealing the fact that the man who thought he was Christ was his brother--death obviously carrying more respectability than craziness. At his next performance, Alpert identified the man as his brother.
*   *   *
The essential difference between Tim Leary and G. Gordon Liddy was that Leary wanted people to use LSD as a vehicle for expanding consciousness, whereas Liddy wanted to put LSD on the steering wheel of columnist Jack Anderson’s car, thereby making a political assassination look like an automobile accident. But who could have predicted that, sixteen years after the original arrest, Leary would end up traveling around with Liddy in a series of debates? 
I attended the debate in Berkeley in April 1982. Leary warned the audience that Liddy was a lawyer--“trained in the adversary process, not to seek truth. I was trained as a scientist--looking for truth, delighted to be proved wrong.” He confessed that “Liddy is the Moriarty to my Sherlock Holmes--the adversary I always wanted--he is the Darth Vader to my Mr. Spock.”
“As long as it's not Doctor Spock,” said Liddy. He argued that “the rights of the state transcend those of the individual.” Not that he was without compassion. “I feel sorry,” he admitted, “for anybody who uses drugs for aphrodisiacal purposes.”
“Gordon doesn't know anything about drugs,” countered Leary. “It's probably his only weakness.” He looked directly at Liddy. “It's my duty to turn you on,” he said, “and I'm gonna do it before these debates are over.” Then he made a unique offer: “I'll eat a rat if you'll eat a hashish cookie.”
Liddy turned down the offer--one can carry machismo only so far, and he had to draw the line somewhere--but he did provide appropriate grist for my own stand-up comedy mill. According to Liddy's book, he actually ate a rat. He did it to overcome his fear of eating rats.  Certainly a direct approach to the problem. None of that gestalt shit. Now, I'm not sure how he ate the rat, whether he just stuck it between a couple of slices of bread, or barbecued it first, or chopped the rat up and mixed it with vegetables in a stew.
     But there were rumors that when Leary and Liddy were on tour, the Psychedelic Liberation Front found out their itinerary and began feeding hash brownies to rats and releasing them, one by one, in Liddy's room at the various motels he stayed at, while he was debating, in the hope that nature would sooner or later take its course, and one night Liddy would feel in the mood for a midnight snack, catch the rat that was left in the room, eat it and, by extension, the hash brownie the rat had eaten, and then Liddy would think he got stoned from eating the rat. This would, of course, be right on the borderline on the ethics of dosing.
     *   *   *     
     Each tablet of Owsley White Lightning contained 300 micrograms of LSD. I had purchased a large enough supply from Alpert to finance his trip to India. The day before he left to meditate for six months, we sat in a restaurant discussing the concept of choiceless awareness while trying to decide what to order on the menu.
In India, he gave his guru three tablets, and apparently nothing happened. Alpert's postcard to me beckoned, “Come fuck the universe with me.” Instead, I stayed tripping in America, where I kept my entire stash of acid in a bank vault deposit box.
     Richard Alpert returned as Baba Ram Dass. Eventually, he dropped the Baba. He was now just plain Ram Dass. His father called him Rum Dum. His brother called him Rammed Ass. One afternoon he was visiting me, and I taped our conversation.
“In 1963,” I said, “I predicted as a joke that Tiny Tim would get married on the Johnny Carson show, and in 1969 it happened. You and I talked about that, and you called it 'astral humor,' but I never knew exactly what you meant by that phrase.”
“Well, it's like each plane of reality is in a sense a manifestation of a plane prior to it, and you can almost see it like layers, although to think of it in space is a fallacy because it's all the same space, but you could think of it that way. And so there are beings on upper planes who are instruments of the law. I talk about miracles a lot, but I don't live in the world of miracles, because they're not miracles to me. I'm just dealing with the humor of the miracle concept from within the plane where it seems like a miracle, which is merely because of our very narrow concept of how the universe works.”
Ram Dass knew of my involvement with conspiracy theory. “I'm just involved in a much greater conspiracy,” he continued. “You can't grasp the size of the conspiracy I understand--but there's no conspirator--it's the wrong word. That's why I say it's just natural law. It is all perfect.”
“Would you agree with the concept--what William Blake said, that humans were created 'for joy and woe'--the implication of which is that there will always be suffering?”
“I think that suffering is part of man's condition, and that's what the incarnation is about, and that's what the human plane is.”
So I asked Ram Dass, “If you and I were to exchange philosophies--if I believed in reincarnation and you didn't--how do you think our behavior would change?” He paused for a moment. “Well,” he said, “if you believed in reincarnation, you would never ask a question like that.”
     And then his low chuckle of amusement and surprise blossomed into an uproarious belly laugh of delight and triumph as he savored the implications of his own Zen answer. I would find myself playing that segment of the tape with his bell-shaped spasm of laughter over and over again, like a favorite piece of music.
Remembering Scott Kelman

     Scott Kelman had seen me perform stand-up satire at Town Hall in New York in 1962, and again twenty years later at the L.A. Stage Company in Hollywood. He moved to Los Angeles and in 1984 launched an alternative theater in the grungy, old, industrial skid-row area of downtown. He named it the Wallenboyd (at the corner of Wall and Boyd) Theater and invited me to open there as soon as it was completed.
In fact, on the first night of my performances, the crew was still banging in the final nails. At the time, I was living in San Francisco, so Scott slept at his office and I stayed at his apartment in Venice Beach. A year later, I moved to an apartment on that same block. Scott became my producer and my close friend. We never had any need for a signed contract.
     As my producer, he would occasionally give me suggestions and I would follow those that I felt worked for me. He’d say in his distinctive gravelly voice (he was addicted to cigarettes), “It doesn’t matter if you fuck up—it’s how you recover.” That was theatrical advice, but it also applied to life.
     And it was a two-way street. For Scott, whatever happened in life automatically became grist for his theatrical mill. He was an exemplary explorer. Knowing I was an unbeliever, he once asked me, “What do atheists say during sex when they come?”
     “Oh, no-God!” I responded, interspersing those words with moans and groans. “Oh, no-God! Oh, no-God! Oh, no-God!” He suggested that I expand that concept into a stage piece, and it evolved into a ten-minute meditation on the relationship between religion and orgasms.
     Scott conducted theatrical workshops, and one of his students was John Densmore, the former drummer for The Doors. “I stumbled into the downtown art scene,” Densmore told me, “after a big peak in rock’n’roll. It felt as creative as the ’60s. I now get off on the process, and it doesn’t matter if it’s fifty people at the Wallenboyd or twenty thousand at Madison Square Garden, it’s the work that rings my bell.”
     Scott also produced Peter Bergman, of the Firesign Theatre. Scott thought that Peter, Paul and Harry would be a great title for an evening of political satire at the Museum of Contemporary Art. He asked the curator if she knew of an appropriate performer named Harry. She suggested Harry Shearer. Scott asked me about him. “He’s brilliant,” I said, “let’s do it.” And so he produced a completely sold-out series that was extended for two weekends.
     But if Harry had been named after his other grandfather, there wouldn’t have been a Peter, Paul and Harry. Each of us prepared to perform in our own particular way. Peter stared at himself in the mirror and made strange sounds to exercise his vocal cords. Harry sat in a separate room where his makeup woman, who had flown in from Iowa, transformed him into Derek Smalls from the mockumentary Spinal Tap.
And I was off hiding behind some boxes, toking away on a joint of the marijuana that served as my creative fuel. Scott was sure that I performed better when I wasn’t high, and he was under the impression I was straight when he told me one night, “That was the best show you’ve ever done.” I confessed that I had smoked a giant doobie before I went onstage. The irony was that Scott sold pot to help pay the rent, and that was exactly the stash that got me stoned that night.


The 20th Anniversary of the Summer of Love

     I never went to any of my high school or college reunions, but I couldn't resist attending the twentieth anniversary of the Summer of Love in San Francisco. At noon on the summer solstice of 1987, young and middle-aged hippies--gray hair and potbellies, but not having erased a certain gleam in their eyes--were marching in an All Beings parade down Haight Street. Costumes ranged from a giant snail to Zippy the Pinhead. 
One fellow still in civilian clothes explained, “I was supposed to be Tarzan, but I had to wash the dishes.”
Local countercultural fixtures were all there: The Mime Troupe, Rosie Radiator and her fleet of tap dancers, the Automatic Human Juke Box, and a panhandler asking, “Can you spare a hundred dollars?” The buses now had posters that suggested Shop the Haight.
The charm of that entrepreneurial urge was not to be confused with the mission of the Haight-Ashbury Preservation Society, whose targets were symbolized by a walking Big Mac cheeseburger, a prisoner of Thrifty’s in chain-store chains, mock pallbearers carrying a casket to mourn the wished-for death of Round Table Pizza, a sign warning Don't Mall the Haight! and somebody in a Merlin the Magician outfit with a placard, You don't need magic to fight the franchising. A lone, sad-faced clown bore a banner with a white dove in a red heart.
In Golden Gate Park, an emcee asked the crowd a series of rhetorical questions to rev them up: “How many people were here in the sixties? . . . How many are here now? . . . How many don't know? . . . How many don't care?” A musician announced, “We were told not to have amplifiers, but we decided to break the law today.” Hog Farmer Sharon Share-alike offered her roll of hard candy to novelist Herb Gold, which immediately aroused his fear of dosing. He asked, “These really are Life Savers, right?”
The Summer of Love reunion continued at the I-Beam, a disco on Haight Street. On stage, I compared the decades:
    In the sixties, marijuana was ten dollars an ounce. In the eighties, it's three hundred. In the sixties, teenagers used to hide their pot smoking from their parents. In the eighties, parents have to hide it from their kids. In the sixties, the favorite chemical drug was LSD. In the eighties, it's Ecstasy. In the sixties, Ken Kesey wasn't allowed to donate blood because he had ingested acid. In the eighties, there are those who are afraid to get a blood transfusion because of AIDS. In the sixties, Lenny Bruce got arrested for saying “cocksucker” on stage. In the eighties, Meryl Streep got an Academy Award for saying it in Sophie's Choice. Now, almost the entire audience at a Grateful Dead concert is younger than the number of years the band has been together--but these kids have less deconditioning to go through than we did. They have less innocence to lose. 

    When a group of students and other protesters, including Abbie Hoffman and Amy Carter (the president’s daughter), won their case against CIA recruiting on campus by using a “necessity defense,” attorney Leonard Weinglass told me that the turning point for the jury was the testimony of Ralph McGehee, who revealed how he had been recruited right off the football field by the CIA, only to become a star player in their assassination-squad program. Members of the jury would not have voted that way in the sixties because they weren't prepared to believe such testimony as they are in the eighties. 

    In the sixties, we knew that the CIA was smuggling heroin from Southeast Asia. And in the eighties we know that they're smuggling cocaine from Central America. The same planes that fly weapons for the contras to airports in Panama, Honduras and Costa Rica come back to Florida, Louisiana and Arkansas with their cargoes filled to the brim with cocaine, even though the administration is carrying on its anti-drug campaign. The pilots only have to be careful to evade the radar screen. So while Nancy Reagan is saying, “Just say no,” the CIA is saying, “Just fly low.”

Meanwhile, the quality of co-option had not been strained. The slogan “Today is the first day of the rest of your life” was used in a TV commercial for Total breakfast cereal. Tampax promoted its tampon as “Something over thirty you can trust.” Beatles songs were used to sell cars, or, if you preferred to walk, they also sold sneakers. Time magazine was being peddled by the Byrds' version of Pete Seeger's song, “Turn, Turn, Turn”--based on Ecclesiastes—t here's a time for this and a time for that, get it?
The Youngbloods once sent a copy of their song “Get Together” to every member of Congress and the Senate, with a suggestion that it be established as the new national anthem, but who could ever have guessed that it was really destined to become a jingle in a jeans commercial? Or that a Jefferson Airplane song would be used in a bank commercial? Or that Timothy Leary would model a Gap shirt for a full-page ad in Interview, and Ram Dass would peddle a rejuvenating skin cream at a Saks Fifth Avenue counter? People magazine was selling the twentieth anniversary of the Summer of Love with a feature story set off by a double-paged cover with psychedelic artist Peter Max's signature on both pages.
In red spray paint, on a brick wall just off Haight Street, standing out among the graffiti like John Hancock's signature on the Declaration of Independence, this message summed it all up: Love Is Revenue.












                         POLITICS









The Last Election

The Republicans’ party line that Barack Obama was “palling around with terrorists” didn’t work, although some people believed it because then they wouldn’t need a racist reason not to vote for Obama. Next, the campaign acted as though his advocacy of age-appropriate sex education for kindergarteners meant putting condoms on cucumbers. That didn’t work, either. Then John McCain tried calling him a “socialist.” Also didn’t work. Ironically, Socialist Party candidate Norman Thomas ran for president six times, and never won, but every one of his platform planks were eventually adopted by Democrats and Republican administrations alike. They just didn’t call it socialism.
In January 2009, Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson stated that God told him America is headed for veritable socialism as well as an economic rebound under President-elect Obama. “What the Lord was saying,” he claimed, “the people are willing to accept socialism to alleviate their pain. Cast off all the gloom and the doom because things are getting ready to turn around. I say with humility, I hope I’ve heard the Lord. I spend time praying and asking him for wisdom, and if there’s a mistake, it’s not his fault, it’s mine.” Humility in action.
In any case, one of the factors in Obama’s win was indeed the confidence-destroying financial crisis, and now he faces a food chain of euphemisms. Hey, is this like the Great Depression? Nah, it’s not a depression, it’s only a recession. Wait, it’s not a recession, it’s just an economic downturn. No, it’s not an economic downturn, it’s a correction. Oops, it’s not a correction, it’s an adjustment. Hurry, get me a chiropractor. Similarly, there’s a food-chain of solutions to the problem. From the Troubled Asset Relief Program to the Bailout Bill to the Rescue Package to the Emergency Economic Stability Act to Alan Greenspan confessing “My bad” to Free Botox for Everybody.
Perhaps the most bizarre byproduct of the campaign began with an anonymous ad on Craigslist, headlined: “Need Sarah Palin Lookalike ASAP for Adult Film.” The pay would be $3,000 and, it was duly noted, “No anal required.” This porn flick, it turned out, would be shot by Hustler Video, and no, Tina Fey did not apply for the job. The climactic scene was a threesome with Sarah Palin, Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton.
Hillary was played by veteran porn star and sex educator Nina Hartley, who told me that “The big hullabaloo over the movie is being generated by feminists from both the pro- and anti-porn sides. They're up in arms that ‘women are being non-consensually satirized’ by Big Evil Porn, and The Big Bad Larry Flynt. The usual nonsense from the usual suspects. Even some pro-porn feminists are upset at Palin being ‘targeted’ by porn. They conveniently overlook the fact that most porn satirizes white men in power: politicians, police, professors. Most recent case in point, The Elliot Splizter Story . . .”
Who’s Nailin’ Paylin was ready for release before the election, as was an issue of the horror comic book Tales From the Crypt, which featured on the cover a painting of Sarah Palin swinging her hockey stick to disperse the Vault-Keeper and other ghoulish characters as she sneeringly asks, “Didn’t we get rid of you guys in the ’50s?”--a reference to the censorship problems faced decades ago by EC Comics, the original publisher of Tales From the Crypt, and concomitantly a criticism of Palin for her “rhetorical question” about removing objectionable books from library shelves.
 However, another publisher was producing a comic-book biography of Palin that wouldn’t be released until February 2009, so two endings were prepared.  But an edition of South Park--broadcast the day after the election--took a risk with only one ending, which lampooned Obama’s victory. Co-creator Trey Parker explained, “We’re just going to make the Obama version, and if McCain somehow wins, we’re basically just totally screwed.” Likewise, Garry Trudeau gambled that Obama would win, and his syndicated Doonesbury strip--published the day after the election--depicted three soldiers in Iraq watching the returns on TV as a reporter is saying, “And it’s official--Barack Obama has won.”
Some editors were undecided about whether to publish it. Trudeau encouraged them to choose hope over fear. “If I’m wrong,” he told the Los Angeles Times, “it’ll be my face that’ll be covered with eggs, not theirs.” Times editors had decided, in the interest of accuracy, to wait for the election results, and if Obama won, they would publish the strip on Thursday, but then they must have realized it was just a comic strip, not investigative journalism, and they published it on Wednesday after all.
Trudeau thought that newspapers should run the strip because “polling data gives McCain a 3.7% chance of victory.” Indeed, a week after Obama’s win, McCain himself admitted to Jay Leno, “I can read the polls--they tried to keep ’em from me.” There were dozens of polls, from ABC to Zogby, and, psychographic sophistication aside, they didn’t always exactly agree. For example, in Nevada during the last week of October, one poll put Obama’s lead at 12%, another at 7%, another at 5% and two others at 4%, which meant that, given the margin of sampling error, McCain could conceivably have been slightly ahead. This, then, was the last presidential election. In the future, you’ll only need to vote for the pollster that you trust the most.
During the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago, I was among 15,000 protesters who had gathered in Grant Park for a rally when the police, triggered by the actions of one of their own provocateurs, attacked the demonstrators and sadistically beat as many as they could reach. It seemed impossible that we could ever work within the system. But now, forty years later, there were 200,000 celebrants who had gathered in that same park, giddy with the excitement of Obama’s victory. They had worked within the system.
During the past four decades, there has been a linear progression from Jimi Hendrix playing “The Star-Spangled Banner” at Woodstock to Aretha Franklin singing “My Country, ’tis of Thee” at the inauguration. Is it possible that this event signified the early tremors of a nonviolent revolution? As the late singer/songwriter Harry Chapin once said to me backstage at a benefit: “If you don’t act like there’s hope, there is no hope.” And remember, placebos work. My hope is I don’t get disappointed. [But I did.]
Meanwhile, the memorabilia business flourishes as millions of voters seek a variety of tangible items to remind them of the part they played in history simply by voting. Mouse pads, baby bibs, aprons, dog jerseys, bobble-heads, niche buttons (“Ventriloquists for Obama”), T-shirts (“Now I Don’t Have to Move to Canada”) and, as reported by NPR, Obama condoms. Somebody bid $400 on eBay for the November 5th issue of the New York Times. USA Today printed 500,000 extra copies; the Washington Post printed 350,000 extras. The only thing I saved was a full-page ad by the 99 Cents Only stores, which included a “Joe the Plumber Special” plunger. There was no limit on how many I could buy. 

A Letter to Barack Obama

October 10, 2010

Dear President Obama,

	It seems that the theme emanating from the White House is “Eat, Pray, Be Disappointed.” And yet, whenever I do feel disappointed, I always realize that the alternative was John McCain, with Sarah Palin just one Halloween “Boo!” away from the presidency, and then I always feel a sense of relief.
Actually, you’ve kept one big campaign promise--to send more troops to Afghanistan--so I guess we can’t fault you for that. In fact, according to Bob Woodward in Obama’s Wars, all you want to do now is get out of Afghanistan. Well, why don’t you just do what Osama bin Laden did; cross over to Pakistan. Since we bribe Pakistan to be our ally, you’d think they would never consider harboring bin Laden, though they reek with empathy when our outsourced drones drop those bombs.
Also, during the campaign, you said you believe that the legality of same-sex marriage should be decided by the states, but that you personally think marriage should be between a man and a woman. Which is exactly the position that eventually led to the revocation of Carrie Prejean’s Miss USA crown. And another thing. You promised to end the raids on medical marijuana dispensaries, but they haven’t stopped.
[In 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder issued a memo ordering an end to federal raids of medical marijuana dispensaries. In March 2011, there were 28 such raids in a duration of 24 hours.]
Here’s how I understand Washington. America’s puritanical political process serves as a buffer between the status quo and the force of evolution. For instance, in order to get Republican votes for the children’s healthcare bill, Democrats agreed to fund $28 million to their abstinence-only program.
And, during your own campaign, you admitted, in the context of health care reform, that the multinational insurance conglomeration is so firmly entrenched that you would be unable to dispense with it. So there would have to be compromises. Now, what with the compromises made to help passage of Prop. 19, amnesty becomes the single-payer system of marijuana reform, and growing your own pot becomes the public option. Meanwhile, as long as any government can arbitrarily decide which drugs are legal and which drugs are illegal, then anyone serving time for a nonviolent drug offense is a political prisoner.
In his new book, Bob Woodward writes about Colin Powell’s status as an adviser to you. Referring to his previous book, Plan of Attack, the New York Times then reported that “Secretary of State Colin Powell disputed Woodward’s account….He said that he had an excellent relationship with Vice President Dick Cheney, and that he did not recall referring to officials at the Pentagon loyal to Cheney as the ‘Gestapo office.’” Who among us would be unable to recall uttering such an epithet? Powell later apologized for it. He has also changed his mind about gays in the military. In my capacity as a stand-up satirist, I used to conduct an imaginary dialogue with Powell.
“General Powell, you’re the first African-American to be head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and you come from the tradition of a military family. So you know that blacks were once segregated in the Army because the other soldiers might feel uncomfortable if blacks slept in the same barracks. And now that’s what they say about gays, that other soldiers might feel uncomfortable about gays sleeping in the same barracks.”
     “Well, you have to understand, we never told anybody we were black.”
And, Mr. President, that was the forerunner of the same “Don’t ask, don’t tell” policy that you promised to rescind, only you haven’t been acting like a Commander-in-Chief. All you have to do is sign such a directive. Those who serve in the military are trained to follow orders. If they can follow orders to kill fellow humans, they can certainly follow orders to treat openly gay service people with total equality.
Not only is the current guideline counterproductive, but also this display of trickle-down immorality must, on some level of consciousness, serve as a contributing factor to enabling the anti-gay bullying and torturing of innocent victims. I know, you don’t want to take a chance that retracting the policy would interfere with your re-election. You’ve made the point that you don’t want Mitt Romney to win in 2012 and turn around all the good things you’ve accomplished.
Incidentally, Romney had wanted to overturn Roe vs. Wade, yet, in 1994, when he was running for the Senate, he came out in favor of choice for women. However, freelance journalist Suzan Mazur revealed that he admitted to Mormon feminist Judith Dushku that “the Brethren” in Salt Lake City told him he could take a pro-choice position, and that in fact he probably had to in order to win in a liberal state like Massachusetts.  Pandering trumps religious belief.
Meantime, since gays and lesbians have waited so long for basic fairness, they might as well just wait for the next election. If you win, then would you kindly do immediately what you believe is right, constitutionally and in your heart, and end this injustice? The ultimate irony is that gays in the military are fighting, being maimed and dying unnecessarily, supposedly to protect the freedom their own country is denying them.
 Sincerely,
Paul Krassner
Postscript:
	I sent a copy of the letter to some folks that day. Among the responses, I received a message from a mother: “I am trying to explain this to my twelve-year-old son, who wants to know why, if men and women don’t share barracks in the military, why gay men and hetero men should share barracks, but then follows with ‘They should all sleep in the same place.’”
And that evening I received this email from a seasoned journalist: “I know it's late, but I cannot wait to ask if this letter is a spoof, or you've actually sent it to Obama. If it's a spoof and you've not sent it to him, would you like to? I've got his fax number and he's got a great sense of humor. May I have your permission to send this to him?”
“Absolutely.” 
Two days later, to the dismay of Obama--who told a town hall meeting that he was restricted because the “Don’t ask, don’t tell” policy was written into law, adding, “This is not a situation where I can, by the stroke of a pen, end this policy”--he wanted Congress to repeal it after the November midterm election, but Federal Judge Virginia Phillips upset that timetable by issuing an immediate and permanent ban on what she considered to be unconstitutional. This ruling was not a spoof, though it was treated as one by an appeals court that set aside her injunction. In December 2010, Congress repealed the 17-year-old law.
Nor was it a spoof when Attorney General Holder—having been pressured by nine former DEA chiefs, plus the president of Mexico--warned that if Prop. 19 was passed, making California the first state to legalize pot, the federal government would not look the other way, as it has done with medical marijuana. Holder (who wouldn’t prosecute the Bush administration for promulgating torture) explained:
“Let me state clearly that the Department of Justice strongly opposes Proposition 19. If passed, this legislation will greatly complicate federal drug enforcement efforts to the detriment of our citizens. We will vigorously enforce the [law] against those individuals and organizations that possess, manufacture or distribute marijuana for recreational use, even if such activities are permitted under state law.”
In a truly free society, the distinction of whether marijuana is used for medical or recreational purposes would be as irrelevant an excuse for discrimination as whether the sexual preference of gays and lesbians is innate or a matter of choice.
     And so it came to pass that Barack Obama was re-elected. His opponent, Romney, fell to his knees and pleaded, “Oh, dear Lord, you promised that I would win. Why hast thou forsaken me?” And the voice of God boomed out, “HEY, MITT, LISTEN--I WAS JUST FUCKIN’ WITH YA . . .” 

Unsafe at Safeway

It was Steve Allen, and later Lenny Bruce, who said that “Comedy is tragedy plus time.” But everything is accelerating. Even the rate of acceleration is accelerating. The time between tragedy and comedy gets shorter and shorter.  The more horrible the news is, the more victims there are to involuntarily serve as setups for punchlines.
Reality has long been nipping at the heels of comedy, and it finally caught up. Example: On the same day that people were being burned alive in the fire at the Branch Davidian headquarters in Waco, Texas, Jay Leno did a joke in his Tonight Show monologue about there being two kinds of cult members there--“regular and crispy.”
Of course, events like the recent madman massacre outside a Safeway supermarket can be challenging. How could made-up humor possibly top the actual absurdity of mass murderer Jared Loughner asking his MySpace friends not to be mad at him. After all, he was merely planning to indiscriminately kill as many innocent human beings as he could, with democracy itself as collateral damage. 
The night before Loughner committed his senseless slaughter, he had taken photos of himself posing with his gun while wearing a bright red G-string and displaying his naked ass. Satirist Harry Shearer observed that “The nightmare in Tucson is the inevitable result of a society where a mentally confused young man can purchase a red G-string anywhere at any time, and pose with it as he sees fit. Can't we all agree now to lower the temperature on underwear?”
Speaking of lowering the temperature, in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, editorial cartoonist Rob Rogers depicted the U.S. Civil Discourse Gun Shop where a customer is asking the clerk: “Do you have anything versatile enough to go from a campaign breakfast to a protest march to a Town Hall meeting?” And in the Orlando Sentinal, Dana Summers depicted another gun store featuring semi-automatic 31-clip weapons, where the clerk is explaining to a customer: “Say you have thirty-one burglars break into your house.”
On the Monday following the tragic weekend, Jon Stewart was unable to find anything funny about it. Nor was Stephen Colbert, although he did present a montage of news clips with various explanations of Loughner’s behavior, and the final one, from Fox News—“He is also being described as a left-wing political pothead”—managed to evoke laughter from the audience. And Rush Limbaugh called him a “marijuana junkie.”
In October 2008, Loughner told an old friend, Bryce Tierney, that he wasn’t going to smoke marijuana any more. Tierney never saw him smoke pot again, and was surprised at media reports that Loughner was rejected by the Army in 2009 for failing a drug test: “He was clean…I saw him after that continuously. He would not do it…After he quit, he was just off the wall. But Loughner did not fail a drug test that day at the processing station. Rather, he admitted on an application form that he had smoked marijuana “hundreds of times.” He didn’t know that the military has an official maximum of times you can admit to smoking pot.
A journalist I know acknowledges that he tried to join the Air Force at the San Diego recruitment office, but, “When the subject of drugs came up, I figured, okay, I have long hair, I look maybe homeless, they're going to know I'm lying if I say I've always been straight. I'll say I've smoked pot seven or eight times--something ridiculously, embarrassingly low. Whatever it was, it was too high. The recruiter said. ‘You can't have smoked more than five times. Go away, kid. Maybe the Marines will take you.’ Two weeks later I was at the Sacramento recruitment office and I had the  ‘magic number.’ I joined the Air Force. One of the stupider things I've done.”
Indeed, Chris Hedges wrote on TruthDig: “Power does not rest with the electorate. It does not reside with either of the two major political parties. It is not represented by the press. It is not arbitrated by a judiciary that protects us from predators. Power rests with corporations. And corporations gain very lucrative profits from war, even wars we have no chance of winning. All polite appeals to the formal systems of power will not end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We must physically obstruct the war machine or accept a role as its accomplice.”
When it comes to bloodbaths, the only difference between such invisible corporations and Jared Loughner is that he did it face-to-face.
Obviously, Loughner is crazy, but not legally insane, because he knew right from wrong, as indicated by his expectation of life in prison or execution for his unspeakable crime. True, John Hinckley was crazy when he tried to assassinate Ronald Reagan—his motivation was to impress actress Jodie Foster so she would go out bowling with him--yet he was sentenced to serve his time in a mental hospital, including occasional outings with his parents, which resulted in public outrage and a weakening of the insanity defense.
Ironically, Hinckley came out for gun control, and Reagan came out against it.





The Yippies and the Occupiers

     As a co-founder of the Yippies (Youth International Party)—known for demonstrating against the Vietnam War at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago--I find myself comparing and contrasting the Yippies and the Occupy Wall Street protesters.
We had to perform stunts to get media coverage of our cause, so a group of us went to the New York Stock Exchange, upstairs to the balcony, and threw $200 worth of singles onto the floor below, watching the gang of manic brokers suddenly morph from yelling Pork Bellies into playing Diving for Dollars. Then we held a press conference outside, explaining the connection between the capitalist system and the war.
Now, a particular placard, “Wall Street Is War Street,” gives me a sense of continuity. Other anonymous Occupier spokespersons carried posters proclaiming: “God Forbid We Have Sex & Smoke Pot. They Want Us to Grab Guns & Go to War!” “I am an immigrant. I came here to take your job. But you don’t have one.” “$96,000 for a BA in Hispanic transgender gay & lesbian studies and I can’t find work!” And a woman in a wheelchair: “Stand Up For Your Rights!”
By the sheer power of numbers without the necessity of stunts, the Occupiers have broadened public awareness about  the economic injustice perpetuated by corporations without compassion conspiring with government corruption that has resulted in immeasurable suffering. The Yippies were a myth that became a reality. The Occupiers are a reality that became a myth. The spirit of nonviolent revolution is what connects them.
NPR waited until eleven days of Occupy Wall Street had passed before reporting its existence. The executive news editor explained that the Occupiers “did not involve large numbers of people” (actually, there were already several hundred), no “prominent people” showed up (thus ignoring Michael Moore and Susan Sarandon), the lack of “a great disruption” (the police pepper-spraying protesters trapped in a cage of orange netting finally met that need), “or an especially clear objective” (oh, right, like all those flip-floppy pandering politicians whose clear objective is to get elected).
	The Occupiers appear to be a leaderless community—most likely, you can’t name a single one; not yet, anyway—whereas Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin and I served as spokespeople for the Yippies. We had media contacts and knew how to speak in sound bytes. If we gave good quote, they gave free publicity for upcoming demonstrations. It was mutual manipulation.
Sample: A reporter asked me about the 1968 counter-convention we were planning, “Will you be staying in tents?” I replied, “Some of us will be intense. Others will be frivolous.”
During an interview with Abbie and me for the CBS Evening News, taped at his apartment, Abbie paraphrased Che Guevara and said, “I'm prepared to win or die.” However, that never got on the air. When the reporter asked me, “What do the Yippies actually plan to do in Chicago?” I smiled at her and said, “You think I'm gonna tell you?” That portion of my answer was used to end Walter Cronkite's segment on the Yippies, but my follow-up sentence--“The first thing we're gonna do is put truth serum in the reporters' drinks”--was omitted. They had beaten me at my own game.
The Yippies were inspired by the Buddhist monk in Vietnam who set himself on fire in order to call attention to the war. The photo of that incident traveled around the globe, and I wore a lapel button which featured that flaming image. Similarly, in 2010, a street vendor in Tunisia refused to pay a police bribe, then immolated himself, which inspired a revolution there, and next in Egypt, spreading into Arab Spring, which ultimately inspired American Autumn in 2011.
Inspired by the Yippies attempt to levitate the Pentagon, pie-thrower Aron Kay wanted to get fellow Occupiers to levitate Wall Street. No interest. Likewise, inspired by the Yippies nomination of an actual pig named Pigasus for president, Michael Dare tried unsuccessfully to persuade fellow protesters at Occupy Seattle to carry out his notion that, “If corporations are people, let’s run one for president.” I offered myself as Secretary of Greed.
The evolution of technology has changed the way protests are organized and carried out. The Yippies had to use messy mimeograph machines to print out flyers that had to be stuffed into envelopes, addressed, stamped and mailed. The Internet generally—and social media such as Facebook and Twitter—have enabled Occupiers to inexpensively reach countless people immediately.
When the Yippies were being tear-gassed, and beaten sadistically and indiscriminately, we chanted, “The whole world is watching!” But now, when a bloodbath was expected to happen if the New York police forced the Occupiers out of the park—and then that didn’t happen—Michael Moore asked a cop, “Why don’t you think the eviction happened?” The reply: “Because the mayor’s afraid of YouTube.”
(One month later, Mayor Bloomberg apparently lost that fear; by his order, the eviction happened at 1 a.m. The next afternoon, a protester, before being allowed back in, was overheard remarking, “The cops have occupied Zuccotti Park. We're just trying to figure out what their demands are.)
Not only what occurred in Chicago in 1968 was officially labeled “a police riot” by a government-sponsored investigation, but also an undercover police provocateur—who was disguised as a local biker and acted as Jerry Rubin’s bodyguard—would ultimately state that he participated in pulling down the American flag in Grant Park, destroying it, then running up the black flag of the Viet Cong in its place.
“I joined in the chants and taunts against the police,” he said, “and provoked them to hitting me with their clubs. They didn’t know who I was, but they did know that I had called them names and struck them with one or more weapons.”
Now, as the Occupy model has spread around the country, police brutality has increased, and it’s not surprising that there have been accusations of provocateurs sabotaging the nonviolent principle, not to mention an assistant editor at a conservative magazine who infiltrated a group of protesters in Washington, D.C., later claiming that his purpose was “to mock and undermine them in the pages of the American Spectator,” and that he helped incite a riot at the National Air and Space Museum, getting pepper-sprayed in the process.
     Moreover, a document from the Houston FBI revealed their plan “to engage in sniper attacks” and “kill the leadership” of the Occupy activists “if deemed necessary.”
The Yippies were essentially countercultural, an amalgam of radicalized stoned hippies and straight political activists. And, although the Occupiers are essentially mainstream, their demonization by right-wing media pundits has been providing a repeat performance of neutralizing a progressive cause.
Bill O’Reilly called the Occupiers “drug-trafficking crackheads” and “violent America-hating anarchists.” Sean Hannity said they “sound like skinhead Nazi psychos.” Ann Coulter referred to them as mobs of “teenage runaways” and “tattooed, body–pierced, sunken-chested 19-year-olds getting in fights with the police for fun.” Glenn Beck warned that they “will come for you and drag you into the streets and kill you.” Andrew Breitbart declared that Occupy Wall Street is “a group of public masturbating violent freaks.”
And Rush Limbaugh labeled them “dumbed down” and “propagandized” and asked a rhetorical question reeking with layers of irony: “Whatever happened to the ’60s--Question Authority?” At this point, Limbaugh is like a castrated canine that is still busy humping the living-room sofa by force of habit.





















PORN AGAIN 

Remembering Pubic Hair

Okay, call me old-fashioned, but I still like pubic hair. Internet porn sites now present several choices--completely shaved, vertical landing strips that look like exclamation points, heart shaped, the Charlie Chaplin with just a little patch above the clitoris, and a tiny triangle that serves as an arrow pointing to the clit--yet, for a full bush, one would have to search the Web for “hairy” sites that are considered as “specialty,” “kinky” or “fetish.”
Retired porn stars have commented on this phenomenon. Gina Rome, retired after six years, shaved every day. “It was part of getting ready for work.” When she switched from acting to film editing, she stopped shaving and let her pubic hair grow out. “Shaving was work. I don’t have to do it any more, so I don’t.” And Kelly Nichols says, “I was a Penthouse model in the early 1980s, and I posed with a full bush. No one in adult entertainment shaved back then. Now everybody does.”  
Although Martha Stewart is back on TV, you can be sure that she’ll never give any suggestions on what to do about those big red razor bumps that result from shaving your vagina, so here’s a helpful hint I’d like to pass along--they can be largely eliminated with, of all things, Visine eye drops. But pubic hair is practical; serves as a cushion against friction.
The porn industry has played an important part in shaping pubic styles. Jordan Stein writes in an article titled Has Porn Gone Mainstream?: “Consider the near icon status the female porn star has achieved. She is so mainstream that even good girls are imitating her various styles of undress, disappearing hair and all. Porn chic? You bet.”
However, Julia Baird writes in Celebrity Porn: “The idea that the fashion industry can strip, then exhibit women in the name of ‘porn chic,’ is a bit silly, frankly. But ‘flesh is the new fabric’ could be the new catch-cry. Americans call their bush George W. It’s fashionable--the curious fact is that it is fueled by the porn aesthetic that celebrities love to love.”
Among Hollywood actresses, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kirstie Alley have both admitted favoring Brazilian wax jobs, where most of their pubic hair is removed, leaving a small tuft that remains hidden under a thong bikini. Sara Jessica Parker’s character, Carrie Bradshaw, had her pubic hair removed during the third season of Sex In the City. Presumably, it’s now in the Smithsonian museum along with Archie Bunker’s easy chair and the Fonz’s leather jacket.
On ABC’s Women’s Murder Club, a medical examiner directs her gaze to the crotch of a female corpse and says, “That’s not your mama’s bikini wax.” On The View, Joy Behar said, “No pubic hair creates a wind tunnel.” And in a hysterical episode of HBO’s dark comedy series, Curb Your Enthusiasm, former Seinfeld producer Larry David performed oral sex on his wife, and in the process he sort of swallowed one of her pubic hairs. The next day, he was still choking on it, like a cat trying to get rid of a hairball. 
A psychologist at Harvard Medical School and author of Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty, Nancy Etcoff, writes that “There’s also an erotic, sexual component to hairlessness because your skin is more sensitive when it’s more exposed. Women today are emulating porn stars who have no pubic hair, and I think men like it.” 
My own resistance to the plethora of bald pussies stems from my pre-adolescent days when pubic hair was such a big taboo that I became obsessed with it. In those pre-bikini days, I would go to Coney Island and stroll around the sand, sneaking glances at ladies in the hope of finding a few stray curlicues of forbidden pubic hair peeking out from their various and sun-dried crotches. And if I was able to discover any, why, it felt as though I had experienced a really productive afternoon.
Betty Dodson, sex educator and producer of Viva La Vulva, says, “I think we have changing ideas about what’s public and what’s private. And now that nudity is more public--nude beaches, routine nudity in film, and the enormous amount of exhibitionism and porn on the Web--I’m not surprised to see a trend toward pubic shaving. I think it’s probably here to stay.” She told me that, “Thanks to the lack of a comprehensive sex education for kids, young girls now want their vulvas to look like porn stars because that's what their boyfriends jerk off to and prefer. It's all they know.” But a new study has concluded that pubic hair is returning: “The men don’t care and the women don’t can’t bother.”
     Welcome back, good old bush. Hide and seek a friendly clit.
Ironically, although Arnold Schwarzenegger was only joking when he announced that he was going to get a Bikini wax, actually Beverly Hills skin care and waxing expert Nance Mitchell has about fifty regular male customers that come for pubic waxing who “are not gay and they are not porn stars. Some go totally bare, some just do the shaft and up around the pelvic area.” She explains that “It depends on what their wives and girlfriends want.  Men go along because removing the hair makes the whole package look bigger.”
     Ah, yes, the illusion of size does matter.
The Taste of Sperm

Online sexology columnist Sandor Gardos was asked, “How do I increase the amount of my ejaculate? I’ve noticed porn stars seem to ejaculate copious amounts of fluid, and I’d like to be able to wow my partner.” Dr. Gardos points out that “the actors in porn films are professionals. Even they often don’t ejaculate that much--sometimes movie makers will supplement with synthetic semen shot from a small tube.”
Well, I’m just shocked to realize that somewhere in America there must be a group of scientists in a laboratory who earn their salaries by manufacturing fake semen.
Meanwhile, ManNotIncluded.com has become the first cyberspace sperm bank for lesbians and single women who want to become pregnant. They are matched with anonymous donors who have the desired race, eye color, height and weight, then sent instructions on how to inseminate themselves. John Gonzalez, founder of the website, hopes this service will overcome the hurdles presented by bureaucracies and fertility clinics who are prejudiced against same-sex couples.
“Lesbians hook up with gay men all the time,” he says, “either friends or guys they’ve met through personal ads. We are now simply allowing them to do so safely and without discrimination.”
On the other hand, in the movie, Sarah Silverman: Jesus Is Magic--a performance by one of the best and raunchiest female stand-up comedians--she describes a sure method of birth control: “coming all over her face.” Of course, that punchline is derived from the ever popular image on Internet porn sites, where I look in vain for the small print with messages warning, “Do Not Try This Particular Money Shot At Home” and “This Is Not Exactly What She Means When She Says She’d Like To Get a Facial For Her Birthday.”  
Furthermore, in Chelsea, Michigan, Book Crafters has refused to print Baboon Dooley, Rock Critic, a collection of John Crawford’s comic strip, because his protagonist accidentally drinks from a glass of semen. He spits it out upon learning the content, only to be called a sexist, and challenged: “You’d expect a woman to drink it, right?”  However, on CNN, author Hugh Prather was a guest, and the subject was couples. A caller revealed his problem: “The trouble is, when I come in her mouth, she can’t really swallow it all.” The anchor quickly hung up on this premature ejaculation.
Cartoonist Mary Lawton depicted a character saying, “I just found out that alfalfa sprouts smell like sperm. Does this mean I should practice safe salad?” Yet humorist Jacqueline Shtuyote tells me that “Sperm is basically tasteless. The truth should be out about this. Men seem to think that their white stuff is a culinary delight, yet I know of no culinary courses extolling the flavor of sperm. And if, as rumored, Jack-in-the-Box cooks occasionally spill their cum on an irritating customer’s hamburger, how many of us would be pleased with the added ingredient?  
“Why can’t we find something that changes the flavor of cum? Then men could squirt red stuff that is raspberry flavored, or brown stuff that is chocolate flavored. Shy women could finally delight in swallowing their lover’s cum. No sperm would ever be spit out again. There could be a pill to make cum taste like fast-food hamburgers. Maybe then we wouldn’t mind if we found out that the secret sauce on top of Jack-in-the-Box hamburgers is, after all, sperm.”
But let’s not forget those who don’t eat meat. They face an ethical dilemma--whether or not it’s an acceptable practice for a vegetarian to give a blow job, and if so, is it all right to swallow? The general practice is that, yes, it’s definitely okay to give a blow job because no animal is harmed in the process. And, yes, it’s also okay to ingest the sperm because it’s a good source of protein, something that’s often lacking when meat is removed from the diet.
Finally--and this could possibly be an urban legend--in a biology class at Harvard University, a professor was discussing the high glucose levels found in semen which give the spermatozoa all that energy for their journey. A female freshman raised her hand and asked, “If I understand you correctly, you’re saying there is a lot of glucose, as in sugar, in semen?”  
“That’s correct,” replied the professor.
     The student asked, “Then why doesn’t it taste sweet?”
“It doesn’t taste sweet,” he answered as she realized what her question implied. She blushed, picked up her books and headed for the door, as he continued, “because the taste buds for sweetness are on the tip of your tongue and not the back of your throat.  Have a good day.”

Eating Shit for Fun and Profit

I am in complete awe of the democracy of the Internet, which presents an infinite menu for individual tastes and ideologies, and in this context, specifically to viewers of online pornography. From golden showers to farm animals, the World Wide Web caters to virtually every imaginable desire. With the privacy provided by a computer screen, you can worship at the fetish of your choice. But, in the process of surfing porn sites—for research purposes only, of course—I realized that I had never come across a site specializing in coprophagia. It means eating shit. Literally.
There’s an old saying among nutritionists: “You are what you eat.” However, comedian Darryl Henriques, playing the role of a New Age swami, says, “You are what you don’t shit.”
One of the nastiest things you can say to someone is, “Eat shit.” A nonfiction book, The Pit, reveals a strange cult in San Francisco where a group of successful businessmen were forced, along with other acts of humiliation, to eat their own shit. Ultimately, they were represented in a lawsuit by flamboyant attorney Melvin Belli. But that was more-or-less involuntary shit eating, and what we’re talking about here is the voluntary kind.
For many years I heard stories that comic actor Danny Thomas, the star of Make Room for Daddy, was a coprophagiac. I assumed it was just another urban legend until I bumped into an old friend who was now working as a prostitute in Hollywood. Over lunch, she mentioned the names of some of her celebrity clients, including Danny Thomas. She told me how he had hired her to save her solid waste in her panties so that he could rub those panties on his face and gobble up her shit as though it were cotton candy.
When he finished, he would wash his hands and face thoroughly then pay her and, as if coming out of a trance, he’d say, “Where was I?” He was trying to distance himself from what he had just done. Instant denial. Since then, I have believed that Danny Thomas’s fundraising for Saint Jude’s Hospital was really for the purpose of having secret access to their bedpans.
Anyway, I googled “eating shit.” Topping the list was “Shit Eating Grins: In Defense of Adam Sandler.” But sure enough, I was soon led to hardcore shit-eating sites, which I found totally disgusting, yet absolutely riveting. You may not want to read any further, but we both know you will.
There are photos of beautiful women shitting. If you click for a close-up you can spot a yellow kernel of corn in one big brown chunk o’ shit. Women are spreading shit all over their naked bodies and inside their vaginas. A pair of lovely lesbians are eating handfuls of shit, then tongue kissing each other. Two women are eating the same lengthy turd, starting from opposite ends. A woman, fully dressed, wearing a mini-skirt, is shitting as she walks along the sidewalk. One woman is shitting into another woman’s mouth. Mmmm, good to the last dingleberry.
Among the shit-eating sites, there are Asian movies. Here’s a couple of descriptions: “A bunch of kinky Japanese guys find some truly hot looking girls and take them down below the streets of Tokyo into a real sewer full of shit.” And “Cute Kyoko’s diarrhea suddenly acts up again. Her piano teacher becomes a willing student of hot scat games. Lots of shit pours out of her hot ass into his waiting mouth. Then she asks if he would rub it all over her. ‘Sure, why not,’ he says.”
If there is one particular image that remains in my mind’s eye, it is an innocent-looking, attractive teenager—she’s over 18, of course—and she is cheerfully drinking a shit shake through a straw in an old-fashioned, malted-milk glass.
I thought about her father discovering that video in cyberspace, yet he is unable to confront his daughter about it because he would then have to admit what he was doing at that site. I mean, this isn’t exactly the type of thing that would be mass emailed by one of those selfless spammers, is it? And even if the father did confess to his daughter, he would undoubtedly hesitate to ask if he could eat her shit, because that could be considered a form of incest, and you have to draw the line somewhere, right?
There must be an especially strong bond among coprophagiacs, though, because they have experienced in common a form of liberation from a taboo that can be traced all the way back to infancy, when a parent would cringe and say, “Stop! Don’t eat that! I said no!”
Who knows, some day coprophagia might even become a religion?
Holy shit!




“I Fuck Dead People”

You don’t see many porn sites that feature intercourse with corpses, and if you do, how do you know they’re really dead? But, say what you will about California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, you have to give him credit for signing a bill to forbid necrophilia. Under the new law, sex with a corpse is now a felony punishable by up to eight years in prison.
Age is no barrier. The state’s first attempt to outlaw necrophilia--in response to a case of a man charged with having sex with the corpse of a 4-year-old girl in Southern California---stalled in a legislative committee, but the bill was revived after an unsuccessful prosecution of a man who was found in a San Francisco funeral home, passed out on top of an elderly woman’s corpse.
Necrophiliacs have been getting away with it all this time, but district attorneys will no longer be stymied by the lack of an official ban. According to Tyler Ochoa, a professor at Santa Clara University of Law who has studied California cases involving allegations of necrophilia, “Prosecutors didn’t have anything to charge these people with other than breaking and entering. But if they worked in a mortuary in the first place, prosecutors couldn’t even charge them with that.”
Whether necrophilia is a victimless crime may still be open to debate. Nevertheless, claiming that the act was consensual will not be considered as a legal defense. It should be noted that the necrophilia community ranges from those who are monogamous and stick with one partner for a lifetime, to those who are promiscuous and hop from casket to casket.
According to his own journal entry, Ralph Waldo Emerson, one of the most revered figures in American literary history, was so devastated by the death of his young wife, Ellen, that, shortly after her burial, he went out to the cemetery one night and dug up her corpse, though he didn’t mention exactly what he did with it.
One of the most popular episodes of the police TV show, Homicide, Life On the Streets, was about the investigation of an old lonely widower, a mortician, who used to party with the corpses, setting them around a table as if they were alive. They investigated him because he shot a neighbor who knew about this practice, and then sat in the garden and waited for the cops. But again, the mortician’s relationship with those corpses may have been purely platonic.
Let us now eavesdrop on the dialogue of a few participants in an Internet support group, Necrophiliacs Anonymous:
“Obviously, neither a corpse nor a 4-year-old can provide consent, but if you leave permission in your will for your lonesome spouse or significant other to have one last fling with your mortal coil, shouldn’t the state of California respect your wishes?”
“I still think that organ donation is a better cause. It’s just that I believe the only offense here is really violation of private property. I wonder if someone gives their partner, in a will, the right to have sex with their body after their death, will it be legal?”
“Or, even without that permission, if you are an only heir of somebody, doesn’t it mean their body belongs to you? It sounds gross, but isn’t it an issue of private rights in the United States of America, that likes so much the idea of individualism and is ready to exploit people and the environment in the name of that ideal?”
“I never understood why people think that having sex with a dead body is worse than raping a living person. To me, that’s the worst kind, and then raping poor helpless animals. I really couldn’t care less about my own dead body.”
Conversely, Sam Kinison, the late evangelist who turned into a comedian, had a great routine about necrophilia: “Well, that’s it, man--I’m dead.  Nothing else bad can happen to me now. Wait a minute--what’s that? What’s this guy doing? What’s going on here? [Screams] Oh oh oh oh oh OH OH OH OH OH OOOOOOHHHHHH NOOOOOOO!!! Live in Hell!!!”
	The majority of cannibalistic serial killers are motivated by a kind of necrophilia--it’s usually a highly sexually arousing experience for them when they eat their victims. Here, from my “Great Moments in Necrophilia” file, is a dispatch from Associated Press:
“The prosecution in the insanity trial of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer rested its case. Dahmer has confessed to killing and dismembering 17 young males since 1978. A jury must decide if he will be sent to prison or a mental institution. The final prosecution witness, Dr. Park Dietz, a psychiatrist, testified that Dahmer wore condoms when having sex with his dead victims, showing that he could control his urge to have intercourse with corpses.”
I smell a public service announcement there: “If Jeffrey Dahmer is sane enough to have safe sex, what about you?”








                    COMEDIANS


Remembering Lenny Bruce


     August 3rd, 2016 marked the 50th anniversary of groundbreaking comedian Lenny Bruce’s death from an overdose of morphine, while his New York obscenity conviction at Café Au Go Go was still on appeal. On that same day he received a foreclosure notice at his Los Angeles home.
     But it wasn’t a suicide. In the kitchen, a kettle of water was still boiling, and in his office, the electric typewriter was still humming. He had stopped typing in mid-word: “Conspiracy to interfere with the 4th Amendment const”…constitutes what, I wondered.
     Lenny was a subscriber to my satirical magazine, The Realist, and in 1959 we met for the first time at the funky Hotel America in Times Square. He was amazed that I got away with publishing those profane words for which other periodicals used asterisks or dashes. He had been using euphemisms like “frig” and asked, “Are you telling me this is legal to sell on the newsstands?”
     I replied, “The Supreme Court's definition of obscenity is that it has to be material which appeals to your prurient interest.” He magically produced an unabridged dictionary from the suitcase on his bed, and looked up the word “prurient.” He closed the dictionary, clenching his jaw and nodding his head in affirmation of a new discovery. “So,” he observed, “it’s against the law to get you horny.”
     When we were about to leave the room, he stood in the doorway. “Did you steal anything?” he asked furtively. I took my watch out of my pocket since I didn't like to wear it on my wrist, and without saying a word I placed it on the bureau. Lenny laughed one loud staccato “Ha” and kissed me on the forehead.
     We developed a friendship integrated with stand-up comedy.	In his act Lenny had broken through traditional stereotypical jokes about airplane food, nagging wives, Chinese drivers, annoying mothers-in-law. Instead he weaved his taboo-breaking targets--teachers' low salaries versus show-business celebs, religious leaders’ hypocrisy, cruel abortion laws, racial injustice, the double standard between illegal and prescription drugs--into stream-of-consciousness vignettes.
     In each succeeding performance, he would sculpt and re-sculpt his concept into a theatrical context, experimenting from show to show like a verbal jazz musician. Audience laughter would sometimes turn into clapping for the creative process itself. “Please don't applaud,” he’d request. “It breaks my rhythm.” 
     Lenny was writing an autobiography--How to Talk Dirty and Influence People--which Playboy planned to serialize, then publish as a book, and they hired me as his editor. We met in Atlantic City, where he was taking Delaudid for lethargy, and he sent a telegram to a contact, with a phrase--DE LAWD IN DE SKY--as a code to send a doctor's prescription.
     At a certain point he was acting paranoid and demanded that I take a lie-detector test, and I was paranoid enough to take him literally. I couldn't work with him if he didn't trust me. We got into an argument, and I left.
     He sent a telegram that sounded like we were on the verge of divorce. “WHY CAN'T IT BE THE WAY IT USED TO BE?” he wrote. I agreed to try again, and in 1962 I flew to Chicago. Lenny was performing at the Gate of Horn, where he was asking the whole audience to take a lie-detector test.
     Lenny was intrigued by the implications of an item in The Realist, an actual statement by Adolf Eichmann that he would have been “not only a scoundrel, but a despicable pig” if he hadn't carried out Hitler's orders. Lenny wrote a piece for The Realist, “Letter From a Soldier's Wife,” namely Mrs. Eichmann pleading for compassion to spare her husband's life.
     Lenny had been reading a study of anti-Semitism by Jean-Paul Sartre. Now, on stage, giving credit to Thomas Merton's poem about the Holocaust, he requested that all the lights go off except one dim blue spot. Then he began speaking with a German accent:
    My name is Adolf Eichmann. And the Jews came every day to what they thought would be fun in the showers. People say I should have been hung. Nein. Do you recognize the whore in the middle of you–that you would have done the same if you were there yourselves? My defense: I was a soldier. I saw the end of a conscientious day's effort. I watched through the portholes. I saw every Jew burned and turned into soap.

    Do you people think yourselves better because you burned your enemies at long distance with missiles without ever seeing what you had done to them? Hiroshima auf Wiedersehen. [German accent ends.] If we would have lost the war, they would have strung Truman up by the balls, Jim. Are you kidding with that? Not what kid told kid told kid. They would just schlep out all those Japanese mutants. “Here they did; there they are.” And Truman said they'd do it again. That's what they should have the same day as Remember Pearl Harbor. Play them in unison.

     Lenny was arrested for obscenity that night. One of the items in the Chicago police report complained: “Then talking about the war he stated, ‘If we would have lost the war, they would have strung Truman up by the balls.’” The cops also broke open Lenny's candy bars, looking for drugs. They checked the IDs of audience members, including George Carlin, who told the cops, “I don’t believe in IDs.”  Then they arrested him for disorderly conduct, dragged him along by the seat of his pants and hoisted him into the police wagon. 
     “What are you doing here?” Lenny asked. 
     “I didn’t want to show them my ID.”
      “You schmuck.”
     Lenny was released on bail, but the head of the Vice Squad warned the Gate of Horn manager: “If this man ever uses a four-letter word in this club again, I'm going to pinch you and everyone in here. If he ever speaks against religion, I'm going to pinch you and everyone in here. Do you understand? You've had good people here. But he mocks the pope--and I'm speaking as a Catholic--I'm here to tell you your license is in danger. We're going to have someone here watching every show.”
And indeed, the Gate of Horn's liquor license was suspended. There were no previous allegations against the club, and the current charge involved neither violence nor drunken behavior. The only charge pressed by the city prosecutor was Lenny Bruce's allegedly obscene performance. Nobody’s prurience was aroused, but that made no difference. After all, there wasn’t any law against blasphemy. 
     “Chicago is so corrupt, it’s thrilling,” Lenny said.
     Chicago had the largest membership in the Roman Catholic Church of any archdiocese in the country. Lenny's jury consisted entirely of Catholics. The judge was Catholic. The prosecutor and his assistant were Catholic. On Ash Wednesday, the judge removed the spot of ash from his forehead and told the bailiff to instruct the others to do likewise. The sight of a judge, two prosecutors and twelve jurors, every one with a spot of ash on their foreheads, would have all the surrealistic flavor of a Lenny Bruce fantasy.
     Since he often talked on stage about his environment, and since police cars and courtrooms had become his environment, the content of Lenny's performances began to revolve more and more around the inequities of the legal system. “In the Halls of Justice,” he declared, “the only justice is in the halls.” But he also said, “I love the law.” Instead of an unabridged dictionary, he now carried law books in his suitcase. His room was cluttered with tapes and transcripts and photostats and law journals and legal briefs.
     Once he was teasing his ten-year-old daughter, Kitty, by pretending not to believe what she was telling him. “Daddy,” she said, “you'd believe me if it was on tape.”
Lenny's jazz jargon was gradually being replaced by legal jargon. He had become intimate not only with the statutes concerning obscenity and narcotics but also with courtroom procedure, and his knowledge would be woven into his performances. But as clubs became increasingly afraid to hire him, he devoted more and more time and energy to the law.
     In less than two years, Lenny was arrested 15 times. Club owners were afraid to book him. He couldn’t get a gig in six months. On a Christmas day, he was alone in his hotel room, and I brought him a $500 bill. With a large safety pin, he attached it to his denim jacket. When he finally got a booking in Monterey, he admitted, “I feel like it's taking me away from my work.”
Lenny lived way up in the hills. His house was protected by barbed wire and a concrete gate, except that it was always open. He had a wall-to-wall one-way mirror in his living room, but when the sun was shining you could see into the room instead of out. He was occasionally hassled by police on his own property. One evening in October 1963, we were talking while he was shaving, when four officers suddenly appeared, loud and obnoxious. He asked them to leave unless they had a search warrant.
     One of the cops took out his gun. “Here's my search warrant,” he said. Then Lenny and the cops had a discussion about the law, such as the rules of evidence, and after half an hour they left. Lenny tried to take it all in stride, but the encounter was depressing, and he changed his mind about going out that night.
     When everything was quiet, we went outside and stood at the edge of his unused swimming pool. Dead leaves floated in the water. Lenny cupped his hands to his mouth. “All right, you dogs,” he called out. “Bark for the rich man!”--thereby setting off a chain reaction of barking dogs, a canine chorus echoing through Hollywood Hills. 
     We ordered some pizza, and he played some old tapes, ranging from a faith healer to patriotic World War II songs. “Good-bye, Mama, I'm off to Yokohama, the Land of Yama-Yama…”
     Back at the Café Au Go Go arrest in New York, Lenny had told a fantasy tale about Eleanor Roosevelt, quoting her, “I've got the nicest tits that have ever been in this White House…” The top of the police complaint was “Eleanor Roosevelt and her display of tits.” At the trial, Lenny acted as his own attorney. He had obtained the legislative history of an Albany statute, and he discovered that back in 1931 there was an amendment proposed, which excluded from arrest in an indecent performance: stagehands, spectators, musicians, and--here was the fulcrum of his defense--actors. The law had been misapplied to him. Despite opposition by the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, the amendment was finally signed into law by then-Governor Roosevelt, but to no avail.
“Ignoring the mandate of Franklin D. Roosevelt,” Lenny observed, “is a great deal more offensive than saying Eleanor has lovely nay-nays.”
On October 13, 1965 (Lenny's 40th birthday), instead of surrendering to the authorities in New York, he filed suit at the U.S. District Court in San Francisco to keep out of prison, and he got himself officially declared a pauper. Two months before his death in 1966, Lenny wrote to me: “I'm still working on the bust of the government of New York State.” And he included his doodle of Christ nailed to a crucifix, with a speech balloon asking, “Where the hell is the ACLU?”
After he died, at a séance, his mother brought his old faded denim jacket. That large safety pin was still attached to it. And at the funeral, his sound engineer friend dropped Lenny's microphone into his grave before the dirt was piled on. Lenny's problem had been that he wanted to talk on stage with the same freedom that he had in his living room. That problem doesn’t happen to stand-up comedians any more.
     As for me, I’m working on my long awaited (by me) first novel. It’s about a contemporary Lenny Bruce-type satirist. Those scenes where my protagonist performs, I’ve developed onstage myself, although at times it felt like I was actually channeling Lenny, until the day that he said, “C’mon, Paul, you know you don't believe in that shit.” Well, this ended that wishful-thinking delusion.
I told my friend Avery Corman--author of Oh, God and Kramer vs. Kramer-- how I welcomed the challenge of writing fiction.
“But, you know,” I added, “it’s really hard to write. You have to make everything up.”
And he said, “Hey, listen, you’ve been making stuff up all your life.”
“Yeah, but that was journalism.”


My Acid Trip With Groucho Marx

LSD was influencing music, painting, spirituality, and even the stock market. Tim Leary once let me listen in on a call from a Wall Street broker thanking him for turning him onto acid because it gave him the courage to sell short. Leary had a certain sense of pride about the famous folks he and his associates had introduced to the drug.
“But,” he told me, “I consider Otto Preminger one of our failures.”
I first met Preminger in 1960 while I was conducting a panel on censorship for Playboy. He had defied Hollywood's official seal of approval by refusing to change the script of The Moon Is Blue. He wouldn't take out the word virgin.
     At the end of our interview, he asked, “Ven you tronscripe dis, vill you vix op my Henglish?”
“Oh, sure,” I replied quickly. “Of course.”
“Vy? Vot's drong viz my Henglish?”
I saw Preminger again in 1967. He was making a movie called Skidoo, starring Jackie Gleason as a retired criminal. Preminger told me he had originally intended that role for Frank Sinatra. Skidoo was pro-acid propaganda thinly disguised as a comedy adventure. However, LSD was not why the FBI was annoyed with the film. Rather, according to Gleason's FBI files, the FBI objected to one scene in the script where a file cabinet is stolen from an FBI building. Gleason was later approved as a special FBI contact in the entertainment business.
One of the characters in Skidoo was a Mafia chieftain named God. Screenwriter Bill Cannon had suggested Groucho Marx for the part. Preminger said it wasn't a good idea, but since they were already shooting, and that particular character was needed on the set in three days, Groucho would be playing God after all. During one scene, Preminger was screaming instructions at him. Groucho yelled back, “Are you drunk?”
     I had dinner with him that evening. He was concerned about the script of Skidoo because it pretty much advocated LSD, which he had never tried, but he was curious. Moreover, he felt a certain responsibility to his young audience not to steer them wrong. He had read my descriptions of acid trips, so he asked if I could I possibly get him some pure stuff, and would I care to accompany him on a trip? I did not play hard to get. We arranged to ingest those little 300-microgram white tablets one afternoon at the home of an actress in Beverly Hills.
Groucho was especially interested in the countercultural aspects of LSD. I mentioned a couple of incidents that particularly tickled him, and his eyes sparkled with delight. One was about how, on Haight Street, runaway youngsters, refugees from their own families, had stood outside a special tourist bus–guided by a driver “trained in sociological significance”--and they held mirrors up to the cameras pointing at them from the windows, so that the tourists would get photos of themselves trying to take photos.
     The other was about the day that LSD became illegal. In San Francisco, at precisely two o'clock in the afternoon, a cross-fertilization of mass protest and tribal celebration had taken place, as several hundred young people simultaneously swallowed tabs of acid while the police stood by helplessly
     “Internal possession wasn't against the law,” I explained to Groucho.
“And they trusted their friends more than they trusted the government,” he said. “I like that.”
We had a period of silence and a period of listening to music. I was accustomed to playing rock’n’roll while tripping, but the record collection at this house consisted entirely of classical music and Broadway show albums. First, we listened to the “Bach Cantata No. 7.” “I'm supposed to be Jewish,” Groucho said, “but I was seeing the most beautiful visions of Gothic cathedrals. Do you think Bach knew he was doing that?”
“I don't know. I was seeing beehives and honeycombs myself.”
Later, we were listening to the score of a musical comedy, Fanny. There was one song called “Welcome Home,” where the lyrics go something like, “Welcome home, says the clock,” and the chair says, “Welcome home,” and so do various other pieces of furniture. Groucho started acting out each line, as though he were actually being greeted by the clock, the chair, and the rest of the furniture. He was like a child, charmed by his own ability to respond to the music that way.
There was a bowl of fruit on the dining room table. During a snack, he said, “I never thought eating a nice juicy plum would be the biggest thrill of my life.” Then we talked about the sexual revolution. Groucho asked, “Have you ever laid two ladies together?”
     I told him about the time that I was being interviewed by a couple of students from a Catholic girls' school. Suddenly Sheila, The Realist's “Scapegoat,” and Marcia, the “Shit-On”--she had given herself that title because “What could be lower than a Scapegoat?”--walked out of their office totally nude. “Sorry to interrupt, Paul,” said Sheila,  “but it's Wednesday--time for our weekly orgy.”The interviewers left in a hurry. Sheila and Marcia led me up the stairs to my loft bed, and we had a delicious threesome. It had never happened before, and it would never happen again.
At one point in our conversation, Groucho somehow got into a negative space. He was equally cynical about institutions, such as marriage--“legal quicksand”--and individuals, such as Lyndon Johnson, referred to as “that potato-head.”
     Eventually, I asked, “What gives you hope?”
He thought for a moment. Then he just said one word: “People.”
I told him about the sketch I had written for Steve Allen, “Unsung Heroes of Television,” with the man whose job it was on You Bet Your Life to wait for the secret word to be said so that he could drop the duck down, and Groucho told me about one of his favorite contestants on the show. “He was an elderly gentleman with white hair, but quite a chipper fellow. I asked him what he did to retain his sunny disposition. 'Well, I'll tell you, Groucho,’ he says, 'every morning I get up and I make a choice to be happy that day.'”
Groucho was holding onto his cigar for a long time, but he never smoked it, he only sniffed it occasionally. “Everybody has their own Laurel and Hardy,” he mused. “A miniature Laurel and Hardy, one on each shoulder. Your little Oliver Hardy bawls you out--he says, ‘Well, this is a fine mess you've gotten us into.’ And your little Stan Laurel gets all weepy–--Oh, Ollie, I couldn't help it. I'm sorry, I did the best I could.’”
Later, when Groucho started chuckling to himself, I hesitated to interrupt his reverie, but I had to ask, “What struck you funny?”
“I was thinking about this movie, Skidoo,” he said. “I mean some of it is just plain ridiculous. This hippie inmate puts a letter he got, which is soaked in LSD, into the water supply of the prison, and suddenly everybody gets completely reformed. There's a prisoner who says, ‘Oh, gosh, now I don't have to be a rapist any more!’ But it's also sophisticated in its own way. I like how Jackie Gleason, the character he plays, accepts the fact that he's not the biological father of his daughter.”
“Oh, really? That sounds like the ultimate ego loss.”
“But I'm really getting a big kick out of playing somebody named God like a dirty old man. You wanna know why?”
“Typecasting?”
“No, no--it's because--do you realize that irreverence and reverence are the same thing?”
“Always?”
“If they're not, then it's a misuse of your power to make people laugh.” His eyes began to tear. “That's funny. I'm not even sad.” Then he went to urinate, and when he came back, he said, “You know, everybody is waiting for miracles to happen. But the whole human body is a goddamn miracle.” He recalled Otto Preminger telling him about his own response to taking LSD and then he mimicked Preminger's accent: “I saw tings, bot I did not zee myself.” Groucho was looking in a mirror on the dining room wall, and he said, “Well, I can see myself, but I still don't understand what the hell I'm doing here . . .”
A week later, Groucho told me that members of the Hog Farm commune who were extras in the movie had turned him on with marijuana on the set of Skidoo. “You know,” I said, “my mother once warned me that LSD would lead to pot.” “Well,” he said, ”your mother was right.”
When Skidoo was released, Tim Leary saw it, and he cheerfully admitted, “I was fooled by Otto Preminger. He's much hipper than me.”
    In 1971, during an interview with Flash magazine, Groucho said, “I think the only hope this country has is Nixon's assassination.” Yet he wasn't subsequently arrested for threatening the life of a president. In view of the indictment against Black Panther David Hilliard for using similar rhetoric, I wrote to the Justice Department to find out the status of their case against Groucho, and received this reply:
    Dear Mr. Krassner:

    Responding to your inquiry, the Supreme Court has held that Title 18 U.S.C., Section 871, prohibits only “true” threats. It is one thing to say that “I (or we) will kill Richard Nixon” when you are the leader of an organization which advocates killing people and overthrowing the Government; it is quite another to utter the words which are attributed to Mr. Marx, an alleged comedian. It was the opinion of both myself and the United States Attorney in Los Angeles (where Marx's words were alleged to have been uttered) that the latter utterance did not constitute a “true” threat.

    Very Truly Yours,
    James L. Browning, Jr.
    United States Attorney

It would later be revealed that the FBI had published pamphlets in the name of the Black Panthers, advocating the killing of cops, and that an FBI file on Groucho Marx had indeed been started, and he actually was labeled a “national security risk.” I phoned Groucho to tell him the good news.
“I deny everything,” he said, “because I lie about everything.” He paused, then added, “And everything I deny is a lie.”
     The last time I saw Groucho was in 1976. He was speaking at the Los Angeles Book Fair. He looked frail and unsmiling, but he was alert and irascible as ever. He took questions from the audience.
“Are you working on a film now?”
“No, I'm answering silly questions.”
“What are your favorite films?”
“Duck Soup. Night at the Opera.”
“What do you think about Richard Nixon?”
“He should be in jail.”
“Is humor an important issue in the presidential campaign?”
“Get your finger out of your mouth.”
“What do you dream about?”
“Not about you.”
“What inspired you to write?”
“A fountain pen. A piece of paper.”
Then I called out a question: “What gives you the most optimism?”
I expected him to say “People” again, but this time he said, “The world.”
     There was hardly any standing room left in the auditorium, yet one fellow was sitting on the floor rather than take the aisle seat occupied by a large Groucho Marx doll.


Remembering George Carlin


     George Carlin died in June 2008. He was a generous friend. When I performed in Los Angeles, he sent a limousine to pick me up at the airport, and I stayed at his home. And such a sweet man. When I opened for him at the Warner-Grand Theater in San Pedro, we were hanging around in his dressing room, where he was nibbling from a vegetable plate. I watched as he continued to be genuinely gracious with every fan who stopped by. If they wanted his autograph, he would gladly sign his name.  If they wanted to be photographed with him, he would assume the pose. If they wanted to have a little chat, he indulged them with congeniality.
I said,  “You really show respect for everybody.”
“Well,” he responded, “that's just the way I would want to be treated.”
As a performer, Carlin was uncompromising, knowing that his audience trusted him not to be afraid of offending them.  In fact, he was excited by that possibility.  The day before one of his live HBO specials, he called and told me to be sure and watch it, because he would devote the first ten minutes of his performance to the subject of abortion.
Carlin had long been vocal in support of the right to smoke and ingest various drugs, and he posed this rhetorical question: “Why are there no recreational drugs in suppository form?”  I was pleased to inform him that teenage girls have been experimenting with tampons soaked in vodka, inserting them vaginally or rectally as a way of getting intoxicated without their parents detecting booze on their breath.
No matter what else Richard Nixon accomplished in his lifetime, his obituaries always mentioned him as the first American president to resign, and no matter what else George Carlin accomplished in his lifetime, his obits always connected him with the Supreme Court ruling on “The Seven Words You Can’t Say on Television.”
When asked in the Green Room at the Warner-Grand Theater by producer Dan Pasley why he didn’t include the word “nigger” in that list, Carlin replied, “There’s nothing funny about it -- that really is a dirty word -- but repressed words about sexual functions and bodily parts were truly funny. I had only been thinking about the ‘dirty’ words in terms of sex and bodily functions, and how uptight these religious freaks have made us.  That’s fun, that’s some funny shit.”
At a private memorial for family and friends, Carlin's daughter Kelly read from his burial instructions, written on May 1, 1990:
Upon my death, I wish to be cremated.  The disposition of my ashes (dispersal at sea, on land or in the air) shall be determined by my surviving family (wife and daughter) in accordance with their knowledge of my prejudices and philosophies regarding geography and spirituality.  Under no circumstances are my ashes to be retained by anyone or buried in a particular location.  The eventual dispersal can be delayed for any reasonable length of time required to reach a decision, but not to exceed one month following my death.

I wish no public service of any kind.  I wish no religious service of any kind. I prefer a private gathering at my home, attended by friends and family members who shall be determined by my surviving family (wife and daughter).  It should be extremely informal, they should play rhythm and blues music, and they should laugh a lot. Vague references to spirituality (secular) will be permitted.  

Kelly added, “There will be no mention of God allowed” and “No one will be allowed to say that ‘George is now smiling down at us from Heaven above.’”
Carlin once told an audience of children how to be a class clown as a way of attracting attention.  “I didn’t start out with fake heart attacks in the aisle,” he explained.  Ah, if only that’s what he was doing this time.
But a reporter did once ask him how he wanted to die.
“I’d like to explode spontaneously in someone’s living room,” he replied.  “That, to me, is the way to go out.”
And, through his CDs, DVDs, books, and online, George Carlin does indeed continue to explode spontaneously in living rooms across the country and around the world. Roasting With Robin


The first time I met Robin Williams was in 1976 at the first annual Comedy Competition in San Francisco. He was sweating profusely, his hairy chest and arms showing, and he wore a brown cowboy hat. I was one of the judges. Although I voted for Williams, he came in second.
     I forget the winner’s name, but I recall that the lights went off in the middle of his act, so he took advantage of the accident, and in the darkness he whispered loudly, “Okay, now, when the lights go back on, everybody shout out, ‘Surprise! Surprise!’” The audience laughed and applauded that ad lib.
     Robin’s disappointment was palpable, but his stardom was inevitable. Our paths continued to cross backstage at benefits where we both performed. He was also a reader of The Realist. In 1988, the word got around that I was going to undergo surgery, and he sent me a generous unsolicited check to help.
In 1998, Anita Hoffman, Abbie’s widow, dying from cancer, decided to take her life on December 27, so as not to spoil Christmas for family and friends who were visiting and bringing all kinds of food. Her appetite was ravenous, and her humor was dark. After devouring a pastrami sandwich, she remarked, “I better brush my teeth, I don’t want to get gum pockets.”
     She was staying at a house in San Francisco owned by actress Wynona Rider, whose godfather was Timothy Leary. He had been Anita’s role model during the final months of his life. “You couldn’t choose how and when and with whom you were born,” he said, “but you can take charge of your own death.” And that’s exactly what she was now doing.
     Robin Williams learned about Anita’s situation from his co-star in Good Will Hunting, Matt Damon, who had been told about it by his girlfriend, Wynona. Robin had never met Anita, but he called and offered to pay a visit, in keeping with his benign case of Patch Adams Syndrome. After all, if Patch could travel to Trinidad to entertain murderers who would be hanged three days later, why shouldn’t it be appropriate for Robin to make Anita laugh on Christmas day? She hesitated—“I’ve never really been a fan of his work,” she thought—but then invited him to visit….
     And so it came to pass in 2014 that Robin Williams would also commit suicide. In the midst of mass mourning him, Rush Limbaugh explained that “Leftists are never happy.” And the anti-choice Lifenews claimed that Robin killed himself out of guilt over an abortion his girlfriend had in the 1970s.
     The last time I saw him was in 1987 on a Saturday evening at the Hollywood Press Club, where we were both participants at a roast for Harlan Ellison, the prolific author of fantasy, science-fiction and speculative-fiction, his work including 1,700 short stories. He also had a reputation for angry ranting with literary style. My wife Nancy said, “He has a black belt in Mouth.”
     The roast was supposedly a fundraiser for his defense in a frivolous libel lawsuit. Although the auditorium was filled at $25 a head, the plaintiff, Michael Fleischer, was suing Ellison for a million dollars. In a 1980 issue of Comics Journal, in a review of Fleischer’s comic-book-novel, Ellison called him “crazy” like H.P. Lovecraft and other renowned writers. Ironically, Harlan had intended it to be a compliment.
     Screenwriter David Gerrold remarked, “The fact that Ellison is a self-made man relieves God of a great responsibility. I’ve been Harlan’s friend for six years. Of course, I’ve known him for eighteen years.”
     The moderator of the roast, film critic Digby Diehl, read a telegram from Isaac Asimov, which concluded, “Kick him in the balls—signed, Frank Sinatra.” Onstage, Asimov’s fellow science-fiction writer Robert Silverberg announced that “Harlan Ellison is so short that he goes up on his girlfriend.” Robin and I were sitting next to each other, and we simultaneously crossed that joke off our imaginary lists.
     There were short-jokes galore. Have a few free samples: “Short? I carry a life-sized portrait of Harlan in my wallet.” “Harlan’s parents were normal, but the milkman was a syphilitic dwarf.” And the producer of Twilight Zone, Phil de Guere, complained, “It took Harlan nine months before he figured out how to shoot himself in the foot at Twilight Zone and get canned. But of all the people I have worked with, Harlan is by far the shortest. Harlan doesn’t have a short fuse. He is a short fuse.”
     My own short-joke was, “Actually, this isn’t a roast. It’s more like a microwave.” Robin said, “Harlan is a tall Paul Williams, a white Paul Simon.” I pointed out that “Harlan is on the right side of a lot of important fights. He’s fought against racism and sexism. That’s why this whole panel is white males.”
     A roast by definition overflows with irreverence, insults, and raunchiness. Examples: “If it’s true that you are what you eat, Harlan would be a vagina.” Stan Lee of comic-book infamy said, “Harlan is a very difficult person to arouse. Ask any of his former wives.” And Robin contributed a metaphorical dick joke: “If you’re hung like a field mouse, don’t stand in the wind.”
     I stated that “Harlan is an egomaniac partially because at the moment of sexual climax, he calls out his own name.” Robin shouted: “Was it good for me?”  I responded, “Harlan has a typewriter with only two letters—M and E. And on it he has somehow managed to write 42 books as well as 300 of Steve Allen’s songs plus a few of Lyndon LaRouche’s speeches.”
     Robert Psycho Block remembered when “Harlan was interested in re-writing other people’s work. He took me into a nearby drugstore and showed me how he had erased all the M’s 
off all the Murine bottles.” I observed that “Harlan has always refused to get involved with the drug world—as a user. However, he is a dealer. In fact, he was the connection for Kathy Evelyn Smith.”
A severe groan emanated from the audience, and I realized that I was treating a roaster as a roastee, not an uncommon practice. Robin Williams and Robert DeNiro had been with Smith and John Belushi on the night of Belushi’s death. “Oh, that’s a good one,” Robin said with understandable Sarcasm 101. “Listen,” I replied, “if she didn’t plea-bargain, you wouldn’t be here tonight.”
Moderator Digby Diehl proceeded to rub salt in Robin’s wound that I had unintentionally caused: “Robin Williams has been called the king of improv, and he has proven it tonight by interrupting everybody, stepping on their lines, doing schtick. He’s been about as annoying he can be.”
“I loved that review, though,” said Robin, referring to Diehl’s negative critique of Club Paradise.
Diehl: “I was hoping you hadn’t seen it, Robin. It’s said of you in Hollywood that you don’t read your scripts. Anyway, ladies and gentlemen, I’d like to bring you Robin Williams, fresh from Club Paradise, his biggest failure yet.”
Williams: “Thank you, Gary Franklin [the movie reviewer Diehl replaced]. What can you say about a man who’s a TV critic? A man who looks at a good film and letters it like a report card. Is that art? I think not. And I’d like to thank Harlan’s lawyer for proving, God, is there a reason for law? I think not. And I’d like to thank Mr. Krassner for all the Kathy Smith references. That’s some funny stuff.”
Robin confessed, “I really don’t know Harlan for shit,” then described his house. “ It’s like Notre Dame done by Sears. There’s Harlan, naked, playing in his toys with a beautiful shiksa goddess jumping up and down saying, ‘I like him. He’s smart.’” Robin morphed into a little boy in the bathroom. “I’m reading Bradbury, dad.” (Roaster Ray Bradbury chortled. Robin suppressed a fake sob.) “It’s just taken me so far down to be here. I wish I could cry but I don’t care.” (The audience applauded.)
“Well,” said Diehl, “it’s been basically a really hostile, ugly night, with a lot of lame jokes and sentimental drivel. But we still have the ritual forgiveness to look forward to.” He introduced Harlan Ellison, “a man with the milk of human kindness dripping from his fangs.”
“Ha, ha. Very funny, I’m sure,” Harlan reacted. “I had a friend once, but the wheels fell off. Zip friends. Dust is my friend. And what of these fuckers here? Robin Williams can’t even get a pair of pants that fits him.”
“There’s a reason for that, Harlan.”
“Yeah, sure. It was for you they made up the phrase, ‘Is it in yet?’ You wanna talk about that, Williams? I’ve got four words for you: Club Paradise and The Survivors.”
     “Yeah, on a double bill with Man With a Dog [Ellison wrote the screenplay].”
     Harlan continued to baste the roasters. As for me, he said, “I want to thank my old chum Krassner for being here tonight. I want to commend him on his restraint in the remarks he made. Or perhaps it was only caution on his part because I promised if he fucked around with me, I’d let on that he caught his herpes from Nancy Reagan.”
     Digby Diehl concluded, “Harlan’s only fear is that he’ll get in a car accident and have to re-live this event. And in the true tradition of roasting, that tradition being to talk dirty and mention a big name, thank you all for coming. And join us next week when our guest roaster will be Mother Teresa.”
     I blurted out, “I fucked her.”
The audience screamed, hooted, stomped, and Robin jumped out of his chair and ran around in a circle. Then he said, “Gandhi is going, ‘Who is this man? He may not get through the gates of heaven for that line.’”
Harlan said, “Thank God Krassner got off one good one.”
I explained, “I guess I just fell into the insult mode.”
“Basically,” said Robert Silverberg, “the roast is a really ugly, repugnant, immature and childish art form. I hate it. And I will only do one if Harlan is the target.”
And on our way home, Nancy summed up the irony: “A compliment was originally perceived as an insult, and consequently we’ve had an evening of insults which were really compliments.”



Remembering Dick Gregory

I first met Dick Gregory when he asked me to interview him for The Realist in New York. I saw him again when I was in Chicago. He was performing at the Playboy Club and invited me to his show. Two years previously, Negro comedians performed only in Negro nightclubs, and Gregory was no exception.
     But one evening the regular white comic at the Playboy Club got sick, and Gregory took his place. It made Time magazine, and he was invited to perform on the Tonight Show, but he declined unless, after doing his stand-up act, he would be asked to sit down and talk with Jack Paar. The gamble worked, and Gregory became an instant celebrity, breaking through the color barrier with humor.
     Eventually we became friends and fellow demonstrators. Now he was performing at the Playboy Club, not as a substitute comic but as a star attraction. They had to supply me with a jacket, and a tie that was decorated all over with bunny symbols. Gregory was already on stage.
     “How could Columbus discover America,” he was asking the audience, “when the Indians were already here?”
     In his dressing room between shows, Gregory took out his wallet and showed me a tattered copy of his favorite poem, “If,” by Rudyard Kipling. I laughed and he looked offended, until I explained that I was laughing because it was also my favorite poem, and “the unforgiving minute” was my favorite poetic phrase.
     Gregory visited me on the lower east side of New York. The entire side of one building on that block featured a fading advertisement for a cleanser personified by the Gold Dust Twins, a pair of little Negro boys. It had originally been painted right on the bricks.
     When he saw it, he said, “They ought to take that whole wall and preserve it in a museum somewhere.”
     *    *   *
     On a work-vacation in the Florida Keys with Abbie and Anita Hoffman in December in 1967. I followed a neighborhood crow down the road, then continued walking to town by myself to use the telephone. First I called Gregory, since it was his city Chicago that we were planning to invade the presidential convention in the 1968 summer. He told me that he had decided to run for president, and he wanted to know if I thought Bob Dylan would make a good vice president.
“Oh, sure, but to tell you the truth, I don't think Dylan would ever get involved in electoral politics.”
Gregory would end up with assassination researcher Mark Lane as his running mate. Next, I called Jerry Rubin in New York to arrange for a meeting when we returned. 
     At our counter-convention we all attended an Unbirthday Party for President Lyndon Johnson at the Coliseum, with Ed Sanders, leader of the Fugs, serving as emcee. The atmosphere was highly emotional. Dick Gregory recited the Preamble to the Declaration of Independence with incredible fervor. Fists were being upraised in the audience as he spoke, and I thrust my own fist into the air for the first time.
     *   *   *
     When my marriage broke up in 1971 I moved to San Francisco and I had my own talk program. Gregory announced on my show that, until the war in Vietnam was over, he was going to stop eating solid foods. I in turn announced that, until the war was over, I was going to eat all of Dick Gregory's meals. Actually, my only real discipline was being silent one day a week. 
     When my young daughter Holly came out to stay with me that summer, she decided to join me on my silent day. We communicated with handwritten notes. Holly wrote, Does laughter count? Since we were making up the rules as we went along, I answered, Yes, but no tickling. Naturally she tried to make me laugh, but I held it in – and got a rush.
All the energy that normally gets dissipated into the air with laughter seemed to surge through my body instead. I decided to stop laughing altogether, just to see what would happen. The more I didn't laugh, the more I found funny. And, paying closer attention to others, I refined my appreciation of laughter as another whole language that could often be more revealing than words. Sometimes I would get a twinge of guilt if I nearly slipped and laughed, and I remembered what I had always known, that children must be taught to be serious. When I mentioned my laugh-fast to Dick Gregory, still on his food-fast, it didn't sound so far-fetched to him.
That's two things people do out of insecurity,” he said. “Eating and laughing.”
“Well, what would happen to us if everyone in our audiences realized that?”
“Brother, we'd go out of business.”

I was invited to a Christmas party in 1977 by Hustler publisher Larry Flynt. Gregory was at the party, and Flynt asked each of us to perform, but first he would take the microphone himself. To my surprise-shock that he wanted me to publish his magazine beside The Realist while he traveled around the country to spread his (temporary) born-again Chrisianity.
     On Thanksgiving Day, Gregory had been arrested in front of the White House for protesting the lack of human rights in South Africa. Larry Flynt had a premonition that there would be an assassination attempt on Gregory. Flynt contacted him a couple of weeks later, and they became friends. Gregory was now staying at Flynt's mansion in Columbus, helping him change to a vegetarian diet. Flynt had already taken off forty pounds. On the day before the Christmas party, Gregory was in the middle of giving himself an enema when Flynt walked in.
According to Gregory, “Larry said, ‘Let me tell you about this fantastic guy I've got comin' out, and I don't know what I'm gonna do yet but I just wanna talk with him.’ And I said, ‘Well, who is it?’ He said, ‘Paul Krassner.’ And I just fell out, and said, ‘Are you serious? He's one of the hippest minds in the whole world.’ Then he came back and said, ‘How long you been knowin' him?’ and I told him, ‘All through the sixties,’ you know. And I said it was a fantastic idea.”
For the New Year, Flynt flew Gregory and me to the Bahamas. Gregory was in the kitchen, diligently preparing a health drink for Flynt – this must have been the birth of his Bahamian Diet powder -– and he was also feeding unfiltered conspiracy theories to his eager student.
     At midnight, we all went out on the dock and stood in a misty drizzle as Gregory uttered truly eloquent prayers for each of us. When he finished, Flynt’s wife Althea whined, like Lucy in the Peanuts strip, “My hair's getting all wet.” It was her way of saying “Amen.”
On New Year's Day, we were sitting in the sand, just relaxing. Flynt had bought a paperback novel by Gore Vidal in the hotel store, but first he was reading the Sunday New York Times and worrying about the implications of juries with only six members. A moment later he was rubbing suntan lotion on my back.
“I'll bet Hugh Hefner never did this for you,” he said.
*   *   *
Larry Flynt had been traveling around a lot, but he happened to be back in L.A. at the same time that my friend LSD guru Ram Dass was visiting, so I had the unique pleasure of introducing them. Larry, Althea, Ram Dass and I went to a health-food restaurant, where we discovered that we shared something in common: we were all practicing celibacy – Larry at the suggestion of Dick Gregory, Althea by extension, Ram Dass for spiritual purposes, and me just for the sheer perversity of it.
When Larry got shot down south by a racist nut because Hustler had a black naked model, Althea had transformed the Coca-Cola Suite at Emory University Hospital into her office, where she was now studying the slides of the irreverent “Jesus and the Adulteress” feature. Dick Gregory was there, and he said, “This scares me.” He was concerned about reaction in the Bible Belt, notwithstanding the fact that Hustler's research department had already made certain that the text followed the Bible.
     And now Althea was checking for any sexism that might have slipped past the male editors’ limited consciousness. The spread was already in page forms, but not yet collated into the magazine, and there was still a gnawing dilemma about whether or not to publish it.
The marketing people were aghast at the possibility that wholesalers would refuse to distribute an issue of the magazine with such a blatantly blasphemous feature. Althea and I voted to publish. Gregory and editor Bruce David voted not to publish. “I’m against it,” he said, “because we're this is an issue that just simply will not be distributed.”
Faced with this crucial decision, Althea made her choice on the basis of pure whimsicality. She noticed a pair of pigeons on the window ledge. One of them was waddling toward the other. “All right,” she said, “if that dove walks over and pecks the other dove, then we will publish this.” The pigeon continued strutting along the window ledge, but it stopped short and didn’t peck the other pigeon, so publication of “Jesus and the Adulteress” was postponed indefinitely.
Of course, Dick Gregory continued to spread his diligent activism until he died. He was a loss to me, and to this country, and around the world, but his powerful inspiration remains.


The Missing Episode of Seinfeld


[Jerry Seinfeld is onstage at a comedy club.]
Jerry: Did God look down at Adam and Eve one day and say, “Oops, I forgot something. Let there be erections.” So Adam got the first hard-on in history. But God forgot to say when. And that’s why men don’t always get an erection when they want one. Women don’t know it, but sometimes men have to actually pray for a hard-on. “Please, God, I’ll be sensitive to her needs, I promise, oh God, please, just make it hard . . . ” 
[Cut to George Costanza, having dinner with his parents. There is no conversation, but George’s father is smiling, then chortles out loud.]
George: What! What! What’s so funny? Is it because I’m becoming more like you every day?
George’s father: Should I tell ’im? I’m gonna tell ’im.
George’s mother: No, don’t tell ’im. It’s private between you and me. It’s none of his beeswax.
George: C’mon, stop teasing me, I wanna know, whatever it is, I wanna know, so c’mon, tell me.
George’s father: Okay, I’m gonna tell ’im. I’ve been taking Viagra, George, and it really works. Your mother and I have been making whoopee like it was going out of style.
George’s mother: Yeah, but it’s not me he gets excited over. It’s only because of the Viagra.
George’s father: What difference does it make, George? Listen to this. The pills cost $10 each, but a friend of mine goes to Mexico and he gets me a whole bottle of fifty for $42.
George: Gee, that’s less than a buck a fuck, isn’t it?
George’s mother: George! You must never say the F-word in this kitchen! [To her husband] See, I told you, we never should’ve told ’im.
[Cut to Jerry’s apartment. Kramer bursts through the door.]
Kramer: Jerry! Jerry! I’m gonna be rich! I bought a bunch of shares in Pfizer when it was real low, and now they put Viagra on the market and all the doctors are getting writers’ cramp from writing prescriptions, and the stock is going up and up like it swallowed Viagra! Jerry, I’m gonna be able to retire!
Jerry:  Retire from what? Kramer, you don’t do anything now.
Kramer: Yes, I do. I scheme. I spend a lot of time scheming, Jerry. But now I’ll be able to finance my schemes. I’m gonna be able to call my own bluff, every day! If that’s not retirement, I don’t know what is.
Jerry: Anyway, I might get this Stand-up Comedy Award tonight, and I’m trying to think of what to say that will sound completely spontaneous. So, Kramer, what’s your current scheme?
Kramer: Okay, I got this idea because of the insurance companies. Blue Cross will pay for six Viagra pills a month. Well, that’s very arbitrary, isn’t it? I mean I get six hard-ons in one day.
Jerry: That’s the national average, you know, six hard-ons a day.
Kramer: Jerry, believe me, Kramer don’t have “average” hard-ons. But here’s my merchandising plan. It’s for one-night stands—a combination package of Viagra and RU486, the morning-after pill. It’s a natural for the unisex market.
[Cut to the restaurant. Elaine and George are sitting at the table.]
Elaine: But, George, that’s stealing.
George: Yep. And from my own parents.
Elaine: You have no scruples. How do you know your father isn’t counting the number of times he “makes whoopee” with your mother? He’ll realize that you took some of his Viagra pills when he thinks he has nine more times to go but the bottle has only five pills left?
George: You think he keeps a tally sheet? He’ll never even suspect.
Elaine You’re in denial again—but you have to give me a couple of pills. I would just love to put a Viagra into Jerry and Kramer’s coffee.
George: Oh, really? I thought you had scruples, Elaine. Dosing somebody is unethical, especially friends.
Elaine:  Oh, didn’t I tell you? I had my scruples removed with laser surgery.
George: Seriously, Elaine, what about all the side effects of Viagra?
Elaine: Stop worrying, George. Hurry, let me just have two. Jerry and Kramer will be here any minute.
[Cut to the Stand-up Comedy Award ceremonies. Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer have been sitting at a table, drinking coffee. Suddenly the table rises slightly.]
Jerry:  Kramer, stop that, what are you doing?
George: Maybe he’s holding a one-man séance.
Kramer:  I can’t get it down! Jerry, I can’t get it down!
Elaine: Gosh, Kramer, you must have been thinking about sex, huh?
Kramer: No, I was thinking about my business plan. That’s the only thing that really arouses me. When I’m with a babe, I just think about my latest scheme and I get aroused. But I always let the babe take the credit.
     [Courtney Cox is emceeing the event. Now she’s announcing the winner.]
Courtney: And the Best Stand-up Comedy Award goes to . . . Jerry Seinfeld!
     [Jerry walks up to the stage. Courtney and Jerry embrace warmly. She gives him the statuette. As the audience applause subsides, the blood flow to the spongy tissue in Jerry’s penis increases. He tries unsuccessfully to hide his erection with the statuette.]
Jerry: Thank you all so much. Well, as you can see, I’m very excited about receiving this reward. I feel all tingly. And I have a headache. I’m a little dizzy too. An erection is like a cop. When you want one, it’s never there. But when the last thing in the world you want is a hard-on—a public hard-on—then boing! I’m busted, right here on stage, with a spotlight, in front of five hundred strangers. I feel like I have to vomit. I’ll try to avoid the first few rows. And everything looks blue. Especially my testicles. Is there a groupie in the house? Well, I’m not actually a group. Is there a singly in the house? Who would like to get laid tonight? I’ll point the way. So I’ve become a human dowsing rod. Now I think I’m gonna faint. But even while I’m lying unconscious here on the stage [Jerry is fainting], my penis will still be a stand-up . . .

























               THE LATER YEARS


Are Rape Jokes Funny?

     Abortion was still illegal in 1970. At the time, as both an underground abortion referral service and a stand-up satirist, I faced an undefined paradox. I wouldn’t allow victims to become the target of my humor, yet there was one particular routine I did that called for a “rape-in” of legislators’ wives in order to impregnate them so that they would then convince their husbands to decriminalize abortion.. 
     But feminist friends objected. I resisted at first, because it was such a well-intentioned joke. And then I reconsidered. Even in a joke, why should women be assaulted because men made the laws? Legislators' wives were the victims in that joke, but the legislators themselves were the oppressors, and their hypocrisy was really my target. But for me to stop doing that bit of comedy wasn't chickenshit censorship, it was empathetic editing.
     	Now, more than four decades later, rape-joking triggered a widespread controversy when a woman who prefers to remain anonymous went to a comedy club, expecting to be entertained. She chose the Laugh Factory in Hollywood because Dane Cook was on the bill, but he was followed by Daniel Tosh, and she had never heard of him.
     In an email to her Tumblr blogger friend, she accused Tosh of saying that “rape jokes are always funny, how can a rape joke not be funny, rape jokes are hilarious.” She was so offended that she felt morally compelled to shout, “Actually, rape jokes are never funny!” Tosh paused and then seized the opportunity, responding, “Wouldn’t it be funny if that girl got raped by like five guys? Like right now? What if a bunch of guys just raped her?” The audience laughed raucously. After all, isn’t anyone who yells at a comedian practically asking to become an immediate target? But this woman was stunned and humiliated, and she left. In the lobby, she demanded to see the manager, who apologized profusely and gave her free tickets for another night--admitting, however, that she understood if this woman never wanted to return.
      In her email, she concluded that, “having to basically flee while Tosh was enthusing about how hilarious it would be if I was gang-raped in that small, claustrophobic room was pretty viscerally terrifying and threatening all the same, even if the actual scenario was unlikely to take place. The suggestion of it is violent enough and was meant to put me in my place.” She added, “Please re-blog and spread the word.” And indeed, it went viral.


      Coincidentally, on the same night that Tosh, in his signature sarcastic approach to reality, provoked the woman, Sarah Silverman was performing at Foxwords Casino, and she touched upon the same taboo subject: “We need more rape jokes. We really do. Needless to say, rape, the most heinous crime imaginable, seems it’s a comic’s dream, though. It’s because it seems when you do rape jokes, that the material is so dangerous and edgy, and the truth is, it’s like the safest area to talk about in comedy ’cause who’s gonna complain about a rape joke? Rape victims? They don’t even report rape. They’re just traditionally not complainers.”


     Ironically, in The Aristocrats, a documentary entirely about a classic joke of the same name, Silverman complained (facetiously) that she was once raped by show-biz legend Joe Franklin. Also, her rape tips for men include, Carry a rape whistle. If you find that you are about to rape someone, blow the whistle until someone comes to stop you. However, another joke of hers goes like this: “I was raped by a doctor—which is so bittersweet for a Jewish girl.”


     In the magazine Bitch (“Feminist Response to Pop Culture”), an article titled “Laughing It Off: What Happens When Women Tell Rape Jokes?” by Katherine Leyton stated: “Some female comics tell jokes that clearly target rape culture, such as one classic skit by veteran comedian Wanda Sykes, ‘Even as little girls we’re taught we have something everybody wants—you gotta protect it, you gotta be careful, you gotta cherish it. That’s a lot of fucking pressure!  I would like a break! You know what would make my life so much easier? Wouldn’t it be wonderful if our pussies were detachable?’ The joke goes on to detail situations where you could leave your ‘detachable pussy’ at home, mainly to avoid the chance of rape.”
                         *   *   *
     In the fall of 1981, I booked myself for a cross-country tour, from New York to Chicago, Minneapolis, San Francisco and Los Angeles.
     While I was in New York, a nun was raped. When I got to Chicago, the rapist was also there. He had given himself up to the police. On stage I explained the true reason why: “He heard that the Mafia, in a rush of Christian compassion, put a $25,000 contract out on his life.” That part was true. “So now I'm asking the Mafia to use their clout to end the war in El Salvador since four nuns were raped and killed there.” They must’ve heard my request. By the time I got to Los Angeles, the Herald-Examiner was reporting that the Mafia was “probably the largest source of arms for the rebels in El Salvador.”
     In the spring of 1982, there was a Radical Humor Festival at New York University.	That weekend, the festival sponsored an evening of radical comedy. The next day, my performance was analyzed by an unofficial women's caucus. Robin Tyler (“I am not a lesbian comic--I am a comic who is a lesbian”) served as the spokesperson for their conclusions. What had caused a stir was my reference to the use of turkey basters by single mothers-to-be who were attempting to impregnate themselves by artificial insemination. Tyler explained to me, “You have to understand, some women still have a hang-up about penetration.”
Well, I must have been suffering from Delayed Punchline Syndrome, because it wasn't until I was returning on a plane, contemplating the notion that freedom of absurdity transcends gender difference, that I finally did respond, in absentia: “Yeah, but you have to understand, some men still feel threatened by turkey basters.”
*   *   *
     The Onion posted a story about a college dorm that was nicknamed “The Rape Hall.” And an Ironic Times headline stated, “Quaaludes Ends Its Relationship With Bill Cosby.” Earlier in Amy Schumer’s stand-up career, she told this joke: “I used to date Hispanic guys, but now I prefer consensual.” She has since been accused of racist comedy. “I used to do a lot of short dumb joke like that,” she responded.” I played a dumb white girl onstage. I am evolving as an artist. I am taking responsibility and hope I haven’t hurt anyone. I apologize if I did.”
     Indeed, in an episode of Inside Amy Schumer on Comedy Central, a sketch--Football Town Nights parodying Friday Night Lights--featured a Texas town’s new high school football coach. He informs his teenage squad that he’s going to be doing things differently. There’s going to be a no-huddle offense. Two-a-day practices are mandatory. And there will be no raping. “But we play football!,” one player cries. The rest of the team chimes in: “But we play football!” “What if she thinks it’s rape, but I don’t?” “What about at-away games?” “What if my mom is the DA and won’t prosecute, can I rape?” The whole town bullies this coach for taking something away from the players that they obviously need.
     In another sketch, Schumer plays a flirtatious lawyer ironically defending Cosby by bedazzling the judge as well as the jury. In a one-woman show about rape, Asking For It, responding to Daniel Tosh, award-winning British comic Adrienne Truscott performs with her bare vagina uncovering a photo of Bill Cosby. And on Late Night, Seth Myers rhetorically asks, Why did Bill Cosby cross the road?” He answers himself, “To avoid a reporter who was asking about sexual assault allegations.” 
     At the National Association of Television Program Executives conference, Jay Leno commented on the allegations against Bill Cosby: “I don't know why it's so hard to believe women. You to go Saudi Arabia and you need two women to testify against a man. Here you need twenty-five [now forty-five].” Leno also used one of Justin Bieber’s song hits for a punchline, pointing out that Bieber “wouldn't want to sing 'I Wanna Be Your ‘Boyfriend'’ to guys in prison.”
     In a routine about political correctness, George Carlin suggested that a euphemism for a rape victim would be “unwilling sperm recipient.” On The View, Joy Behar exclaimed that she would vote for a rapist as long as he supported beloved feminist issues like abortion and the free contraception they bicker so much about.
     On The Daily Show, Jon Stewart aimed his arrow at presidential candidate Donald Trump (who bought 20,000 copies of The Art of the Deal, making it a bestseller). Stewart shouts, “There are probably some non-rapists caught up in that tide, whether they’re unable to rape for medical reasons, or whether they’re just all raped-out.” A clip shows Trump reading out loud from a report that “80% of Central American women and girls are raped crossing into the United Sates.” CNN’s Don Lemon tells Trump, “That’s about women being raped, it’s not about criminals coming across the border or entering the country.”
     Trump: ”Somebody’s doing the raping, Don.” 
      “Touche!,” said Stewart. “I believe we have our campaign slogan: Trump 2016--Somebody’s Doing the Raping.”
     Immediately after The Daily Show came The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore. He plays the same clip just a slightly bit longer: Trump spouting, ”Somebody’s doing the raping, Don. I mean, you know, somebody’s doing the rapiing, You think the women are being raped. Well, who’s doing the raping?” Wilmore repeats: “Who’s doing the raping? Okay, who’s bringing the chips? Who’s bringing the beer? Wait, wait. Who’s doing the raping? Oh, okay, sorry about that. I didn’t know, I had to ask. I have to tell you, though, as far as campaign slogans go: Donald Trump 2016--Who’s Doing the Raping?”  Hey, it sounds familiar already. 
     And on Bill Maher’s Real Time, the reactionary blond witch Ann Coulter defended Trump: “These aren’t people we have to have here. We already have our own rapists and murderers. We don’t need to be bringing in more rapists and murderers.”
*   *   *
     Although Daniel Tosh is a consistently unapologetic performer for the sardonic material he exudes on his Comedy Central series--which features a running theme of rape jokes, even including one about his sister--for this occasion he decided to go the Twitter route: “All the out of context misquotes aside, I’d like to sincerely apologize.” He also tweeted, “The point I was making before I was heckled is there are awful things in the world but you can still make jokes about them.”
     According to Jamie Masada, owner of the Laugh Factory, Tosh asked the audience, “What you guys wanna talk about?” Someone called out “Rape,” and a woman in the audience started screaming, “No, rape is painful, don’t talk about it.” Then, says Masada, “Daniel came in, and he said, ‘Well, it sounds like she’s been raped by five guys’—something like that. I didn’t hear properly. It was a comment—it wasn’t a joke at the expense of this girl.” Masada claims that she sat through the rest of Tosh’s performance, which received a standing ovation, before she complained to the manager.
     Fellow comedians defended Tosh with their own tweets. Dane Cook: “If you journey through this life easily offended by other peoples words I think it’s best for everyone if you just kill yourself.” Doug Stanhope: “You’re hilarious. If you ever apologize to a heckler again I will rape you.” Louis C.K.: “Your show makes me laugh every time I watch it. And you have pretty eyes”--except that he wrote it after watching Tosh on TV, but before he learned about the Laugh Factory incident. Nevertheless, he was excoriated and accused of being a “rape apologist.” But C.K. himself is no stranger to sexual-assault jokes. Onstage, he has said that he’s against rape--“unless you have a reason, like you wanna fuck someone and they won’t let you, in which case what other option do you have?”
      Conversely, in an episode of his TV series, Louie, he reversed such roles. After leaving a bar with an especially aggressive woman, Laurie (played by Melissa Leo), that he had inadvertently met earlier, she performs fellatio on him in her pickup truck, then insists that he in turn perform cunnilingus on her. And he refuses. So, she attacks him physically with unabashed viciousness, mounts him, and he gives in to her demand. In other words, Laurie rapes Louie. No joke. To watch this scene was positively jaw-dropping. It served as a reminder of how often comedians--and their jaded audiences--find prison-rape jokes not only to be funny, but also, as in the case of pedophile Jerry Sandusky, an act of delayed justice resulting in laughter that morphs into applause. A N.Y. Post headline about pedophile Subway pitchman: “Enjoy a foot long in jail.” And “Don’t drop the soap” even made its way to the animated Family Guy. 


     Meanwhile, reacting to the Tosh tirade, Julie Burton, president of the Women’s Media Center, stated: “If free speech permits a comedian to suggest a woman in his audience should be gang-raped, then it certainly permits us to object, and to ask what message this sends to survivors or to perpetuators. Tosh’s comment was just one extreme example of pop culture’s dismissive treatment of sexualized violence, which desensitizes audiences to enormous human suffering. Internet outcry is encouraging, but popular media needs to push back too.”


     And the original blogger posted another message:


     “My friend and I wanted to thank everyone for there [sic] support and for getting this story out there. We just wanted everyone to know what Daniel Tosh had done and if you didn’t agree then to stop following him. My friend is surprised to have gotten any form of an apology and doesn’t wish to press any further charges against [him].” What? Press charges? Rape is a crime. Rape jokes aren’t. They are the risk of free speech. The blog concluded, “She does plan on returning to comedy shows in the future, but to see comedians that she’s seen before or to at least look up artists before going to their shows.”
     Wait till she finds out that Dane Cook suggested she kill herself.
     *   *   *
     Now, over forty years since I stopped presenting my concept about a rape-in of legislators’ wives, I sent the first draft of this piece around to several friends, and I was particularly touched by a response from Emma Cofod, production manager at my then-publisher, Soft Skull Press:
     “Thank you for sharing this! I truly appreciate your thoughts here. I read about this woman's complaint last week, and the whole event turned my stomach. What Tosh did was personally threatening, which is not OK. But even though I fall neatly into the feminist camp, I think your original joke is hilarious—within context, and coming from a comedian whose philosophy I identify with. Color me conflicted.”
     I think that kind of conflict is healthy. And then there was Louis C.K.’s appearance on The Daily Show. This is what he told Jon Stewart between interruptions:
     “If this [controversy about Tosh] is like a fight between comedians and bloggers--hyperbole and garbage comes out of those two places, just uneducated, unfettered--it’s also a fight between comedians and feminists, because they’re natural enemies, because, stereotypically speaking, feminists can’t take a joke, and on the other side, comedians can’t take criticism. Comedians are big pussies. So to one side you say, ‘If you don’t like a joke, stay out of the comedy clubs.’ To the other side you say, ‘If you don’t like criticism, stop Googling yourself every ten seconds, because nobody’s making you read it.’ It’s positive. To me, all dialogue is positive. I think you should listen.
     “If somebody has the opposite feeling from me, I wanna hear it so I can add to mine. I don’t wanna obliterate theirs with mine, that’s how I feel. Now, a lot of people don’t feel that way. For me, any joke about anything bad is great, that’s how I feel. Any joke about rape, a Holocaust, the Mets--aarrgghh, whatever--any joke about something bad is a positive thing. But now I’ve read some blogs during this whole [controversy] that made me enlightened at things I didn’t know. This woman said how rape is something that polices women’s lives, they have a narrow corridor, they can’t go out late, they can’t go to certain neighborhoods, they can’t dress a certain way, because they might--I never–-that’s part of me now that wasn’t before, and I can still enjoy the rape jokes.
     “But this is also about men and women, because a lot of people are trading blogs with each other, couples are fighting about Daniel Tosh and rape jokes--that’s what I’ve been reading in blogs--but they’re both making a classic gender mistake, because the women are saying, ‘Here’s how I feel about this,’ but they’re also saying, ‘My feelings should be everyone’s primary concern.’ Now the men are making this mistake, they’re saying, ‘Your feelings don’t matter, your feelings are wrong and your feelings are stupid.’ If you’ve ever lived with a woman, you can’t step in shit worse than that, than to tell a woman that her feelings don’t matter. So, to the men I say, ‘Listen to what the women are saying about this.’ To the women I say, “Now that we heard you, shut the fuck up for a minute, and let’s all get back together and kill the Jews.’ That’s all I have to say about it.”
     The audience laughed and applauded, as they did fifty years ago when Lenny Bruce ended a riff on prejudice: “Randy, it won’t matter any more even if you are colored and I’m Jewish, and even if Fritz is Japanese, and Wong is Greek, because then we’re all gonna stick together—and beat up the Polacks.”
     My notion of a rape-in of legislators’ wives in order to impregnate them was no more meant to be taken literally than Louis C.K.’s killing the Jews or Lenny’s beating up the Polacks. Rape-in was a misunderstood metaphor; a pro-choice parable that unfortunately has become timely again, but now my target has been clarified, though it's still those increasingly incredible sexist legislators. 
Words and Phrases That I’ve Coined

     I really don’t like to boast, but in my lifetime, on half a dozen occasions, I have actually added words and phrases to the language. It’s something I always wanted to do. What a thrill it must have been for Dr. Harold Cerumen, who decided that cleaning out earwax should be known as “cerumen disimpaction.” And veterinarian Alice Neuticle who coined the word “neuticles”—cosmetic testicles for a dog that’s been neutered.
     So I’m not asking for credit. Or cash. Since money had been called “dough” and then morphed into “bread,” I figured that “toast” would be the next logical step in that particular linguistic evolution, but my campaign itself became toast, in the sense that “toast” now means history.
     Also, I was intrigued by the process of having a body part named after oneself. How proud Casper Bartholin’s parents must have been to have a son who christened the source of female lubrication that takes the friction out of intercourse as “Bartholin’s glands.” But my idea of calling those two vertical lines between your nose and your mouth “Krassner’s crease” just never became popular.
     Here, then, for better or worse, are my contributions to American culture that did manage to catch on, or at least may be on their way.
     1. In 1958, pornography was gradually becoming legal, but at that stage of the game, the Supreme Court was unwilling to allow 1st Amendment protection of “hard-core” porn—as opposed, I assumed, to the term I invented, “soft-core porn,” which was obviously more respectable, though it seemed kind of sneaky, pretending to be squeaky clean. So I decided to satirize the concept with a new feature in The Realist: “Soft-Core Porn of the Month.” 
     For example, phallic symbolism in newspapers and magazines was a key ingredient of soft-core porn. Sample: A close-up of a stickshift in a 1965 Volkswagen ad was accompanied by the question, “Does the stickshift scare your wife?” Soft-core porn now refers to limited sexuality, as seen in network TV dramas and hotel-room movies that feature jiggling breasts and buttocks but no genitalia. The way to recognize soft-core porn is that it gives men a soft-on.
     2. On the afternoon of December 31, 1967, several activist friends were gathered at Abbie and Anita Hoffman's Lower East Side apartment, smoking Columbian marijuana and planning a counter-convention for the Democratic Party’s event the following summer in Chicago. Our fantasy was to counter their convention of death with our festival of life. While the Democrats would present politicians giving speeches at the convention center, we would present rock bands playing in the park. There would be booths with information about drugs and alternatives to the draft. Our mere presence would be our statement.
     We needed a name, so that reporters could have a who for their journalistic who-what-when-where-and-why lead paragraphs. I felt a brainstorm coming on and went from the living room to the bedroom so that I could concentrate. Our working title was the International Youth Festival. But the initials IYF were a meaningless acronym. I paced back and forth, juggling titles to see if I could come up with words whose initials would make a good acronym. I tried Youth International Festival. YIF. It sounded like KIF. Kids International Festival? Nope, too contrived. Back to YIF. But what could make YIP? Now that would be ideal because then the word Yippie could be derived organically.
     Of course, “Yippie” was already a traditional shout of spontaneous joy, but we could be the Yippies! It had exactly the right attitude. Yippies was the most appropriate name to signify the radicalization of hippies. What a perfect media myth that would be—the Yippies! And then, working backward, it hit me. Youth International Party! It was a natural. Youth: This was essentially a movement of young people involved in a generational struggle. International: It was happening all over the globe, from Mexico to France, from Germany to Japan. And Party: In both senses of the word. We would be a party and we would have a party.
     Yippie was only a label to describe a phenomenon that already existed--an organic coalition of psychedelic dropouts and political activists. There was no separation between our culture and our politics. In the process of cross-pollination, we had come to share an awareness that there was a linear connection between putting kids in prison for smoking marijuana in this country and burning them to death with napalm on the other side of the planet. It was just the ultimate extension of dehumanization. But now reporters had a who for their lead paragraphs. A headline in the Chicago Daily News summed it up: “Yipes! The Yippies Are Coming!” Our myth was becoming a reality.
     3. In 1972, I found myself smoking a combination of marijuana and opium with John Lennon and Yoko Ono. Lennon was absentmindedly holding on to the joint, and I asked him, “Do the British use that expression, 'Don’t bogart that joint,' or is it only an American term--you know, derived from the image of a cigarette dangling from Humphrey Bogart's lip?” He replied, with a twinkle in his eye, “In England, if you remind somebody else to pass a joint, you lose your own turn.” Since Bogart and Lauren Bacall were a classic Hollywood couple, I was inspired by that snippet of dialogue to say, “Don’t bacall that joint.”
     4. Intuitively, I was an advocate of equal rights and opportunities for both genders long before Women’s Liberation became a movement. In 1959, I wrote, “From a completely idealistic viewpoint, classified ads for jobs should not have separate Male and Female classifications, with exceptions such as a wet-nurse.” In 1964, that practice became illegal. Masturbation was a powerful taboo for females, a subdivision of the war on pleasure, while it was somehow expected of males. But if it was okay for guys to jack-off, I wrote in a media fable, Tales of Tongue Fu, in 1974, then it was also okay for girls to jill-off.
     5. In 1979, I covered for a weekly alternative paper the trial of ex-cop Dan White for the double execution of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk, the gay equivalent of Martin Luther King. In a surprise move, homophobic White’s defense team presented a bio-chemical explanation of his behavior, blaming it on compulsive gobbling down of sugar-filled junk-food snacks. This was a purely accidental tactic. Dale Metcalf, an attorney, told me how he happened to be playing chess with one of White’s attorneys, Steven Scherr.
     Metcalf had just read Orthomolecular Nutrition by Abram Hoffer. He questioned Scherr about White’s diet and learned that, while under stress, White would consume candy bars and soft drinks. Metcalf recommended the book to Scherr, suggesting the author as an expert witness. In his book, Hoffer revealed a personal vendetta against doughnuts, and White had once eaten five doughnuts in a row.
     During the trial, psychiatrist Martin Blinder testified that, on the night before the murders, while White was “getting depressed about the fact he would not be reappointed [as supervisor, after having quit], he just sat there in front of the TV set, bingeing on Twinkies.” In my notebook, I scribbled “Twinkie defense,” and wrote about it in my next report.
     In the wake of the Twinkie defense, a representative of the Continental Baking Company asserted that the notion that overdosing on the cream-filled goodies could lead to murderous behavior was “poppycock” and “crap”—apparently two of the artificial ingredients in Twinkies, along with sodium pyrophosphate and yellow dye—while another spokesperson couldn’t believe “that a rational jury paid serious attention to that issue.” Nevertheless, some jurors did. One remarked after the trial that “It sounded like Dan White had hypoglycemia.”
     Later, the San Francisco Chronicle reported: “During the trial, no one but well-known satirist Paul Krassner—who may have coined the phrase ‘Twinkie defense'—played up that angle. His trial stories appeared in the San Francisco Bay Guardian.”
     6. Twitter is an interesting phenomenon. It’s perfect for those folks with a short attention span, and it’s scary for paranoids who don’t want to be followed. It appeals to minimalists, such as, say, Bob Dylan. I once asked him, “How come you’re taking Hebrew lessons?” He replied, “I can’t speak it.” And when I mentioned the Holocaust, he responded, “I resented it.”
     Tweets range from the trivial (David Gregory announcing that he was going to eat a bagel before moderating Meet the Press) to international conflicts (Iranian citizens reporting on the uprising against their repressive government). It occurred to me that there could be classic haiku tweets—three lines consisting of 5 syllables, 7 syllables and 5 syllables—adding up obviously to no more than 140 characters—and so I decided to embed the phrase I coined in the following (also) twaiku:
              What’s worth sharing now?
              World War Three or stubbed my toe?
              I have Twitter’s Block.

My Brother’s Secret Space Communication Projects



     When my brother George and I were kids, I could recite the alphabet backwards, whereas he read the entire dictionary. We both played the violin, and when he was nine and I was six, we performed at Carnegie Hall. (I was the youngest concert artist in any field to perform there.) Our younger sister Marge took piano lessons and became a legendary figure at Boys and Girls High School in Brooklyn, teaching music and running the chorus. Now retired, she and two women--one plays the cello, the other a flute—recently performed at the Salvador Dali Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida, playing music connected to various phases of Dali’s life. (She also teaches Tai Chi.)
     Marge was the only one in our family who stuck with classical music. Although I was considered a child prodigy, I merely had a technique for playing the violin, but I had a real passion for making people laugh. I put my violin in the closet when I was twelve, and several years later I used it essentially as a prop when I began performing stand-up comedy. George went to the High School of Music & Art, and was offered a four-year scholarship at the Juilliard School’s renowned Music Division, but he really preferred Math and Science. He surprised our parents, announcing his decision to be an electrical engineer, but they were supportive.
     He turned down the scholarship and instead attended CCNY. “Because,” he says, “I thought then that the violin was good for my avocation, not my vocation. With so many brilliant musicians then, you really had to know somebody to get anywhere in that world. It’s not like YouTube today.” While at CCNY, he played with a square dance group and became Official Fiddler for the New York/New Jersey Square Dance Callers Association. He learned that a caller earned twice as much as he did, so he put down his fiddle and took up calling square dances. He was also captain of the varsity boxing team. 
     George went to the University of Michigan for his Master’s Degree. Our mother insisted–-and to please her-–he mailed his laundry home in a light aluminum case she had purchased for that specific purpose. To pay for his tuition, basement apartment and other expenses, he got a teaching fellowship, was a research assistant, sold programs at football games, and bussed tables at a local restaurant, which he quit when the table he cleared was occupied by fellow students.
     He won the all-campus boxing championship, but had to fight in a heavier weight class since no one else weighed as little as he did. “Being a violinist,” he said, “I was worried about my hands. But my opponent in the semi-final match was an oboe player with a concert scheduled for the next day, and he asked me to take it easy on his mouth.”

In October 1957, Russia sent Sputnik into space. It was the first orbiting satellite, circling the earth in 96 minutes, and making 1,440 orbits in three months. This astounding technical feat was totally unanticipated by the United States and ignited the era of the space race.  At the time, George was working as a civilian scientist for the Army Signal Corps in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, in charge of the radio relay program. He had been recruited by their senior executive of Research & Development, an alumnus of the University of Michigan.
     A week after Sputnik, George sent a proposal to the Commanding General, urging a space communication program. The response: Do it! “So,” George recalls, “I created the first Space Electronics organization in the country. It was very strange making presentations to generals and top government officials. At age twenty-nine, as head of the Astro-Electronics Division, I had the civilian rank equal to a colonel, but I looked like a young kid. It was embarrassing to take them to lunch and be carded by the waiter.”
     That wasn’t his only embarrassment: “At the Signal Corps, I accidentally flushed my top secret badge down the toilet. It took a lot of official paperwork and the notation ‘irretrievably lost’ to finally get a new badge. Also, in 1954, the McCarthy paranoia was paramount. I, and fellow civilians--and military personnel, I assume--had to empty our lunchboxes and briefcases for inspection every time we entered the building.”
     Five months after he had begun as a civilian scientist, George was drafted. In the army, he was assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. He was a “leg,” though. Instead of jumping out of an airplane, his job was to maintain all radios, phones and electrical equipment. He also started the U.S. Helicopter Square Dance Team to demonstrate the mobility of helicopters. When assigned KP (Kitchen Police), rather than peel potatoes, he scheduled helicopter square dance practice.
     Eight months after Sputnik, his team began working on the design of the world’s first communication satellite, SCORE (Signal Communications Orbit Relay Equipment). “There were no reference books, precedents, or Google for information. We were the pioneers. It’s interesting that the first known reference to communication satellites was in a 1945 science-fiction story by the British author, Arthur C. Clarke.”
     It took the team only six months to design and build the satellite, which was launched in December 1958 by an Atlas rocket that weighed 9,000 pounds. “The satellite payload became famous for the tape-recorded message from President Dwight Eisenhower, who insisted that this project remain top secret,” George tells me. “He said the launch would be aborted if any word leaked out, because he didn’t want a chance of failure to tarnish our image. As it turned out, one of the two tape recorders did fail, but his Christmas message to the world was the very first transmitted message from space.”
Eisenhower stated: “This is the president of the United States speaking. Through the marvels of scientific advance, my voice is coming to you via a satellite circling in outer space. My message is a simple one. Through this unique means, I convey to you and all mankind America’s wish for peace on earth and good will toward men everywhere.”

     In 1945, in the wake of World War II, the victors launched Operation Paperclip, recruiting a variety of six hundred scientists from Nazi Germany to work in the United States. President Harry Truman ordered the exclusion of any “member of the Nazi Party or an active supporter of Nazi militarism,” but the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency created false employment and political biographies to circumvent Truman’s command.
     Those scientists were then granted security clearance and infiltrated into hospitals, universities, and the aerospace industry, further developing their techniques in propaganda, mind control, and behavior modification. Among them was Wernher von Braun, who had been a member of the Nazi Party and an SS officer who could be linked to the deaths of thousands of concentration camp prisoners. (Fun fact: He married his cousin.) He came to America in 1945 and became a citizen in 1955. He was called the “Father of the U.S. space program.”
In June 1958, by the time those German importees had become entrenched in a slew of American niche communities, I published the first issue of The Realist, including a cartoon that depicted the U.S. Army Guided Missile Research Center with a sign in the window, Help Wanted. A couple of scientists are standing in front of that building, and one is saying to the other, “They would have hired me only I don't speak German.”
Exactly one year later, Wernher von Braun recruited thirteen scientists to work with him on an ultra-top-secret program, Project Horizon, to build a communication station on the moon. Its purpose was a study to determine the feasibility of constructing a scientific/military base. “I was one of the lucky thirteen,” George remembers. “In fact, you don’t have to be a rocket scientist to be a rocket scientist. Von Braun told me that many of his ideas came from science-fiction magazines. 
     “The project was so secret that the thirteen of us could not even tell our bosses--they didn’t have what was called ‘need to know.’ I would tell [my wife] Judith that I was going to Washington, D.C., and then I would change planes to go to Huntsville, Alabama, where much of the work was done. I made up stories about Washington for her, while I really was in Huntsville, which also was the watercress capital of the world. I’d make up a story about the cherry blossoms, or seeing a senator in the street.
     “Unfortunately, when I left the government after nine years (two in the army), I lost my own security rating and need-to-know, so I had no idea if the station was ever built on the moon, and I no longer got cheap watercress.” According to Wikipedia, “The permanent outpost was predicted to cost $6 billion and become operational in December 1966. A lunar landing-and-return vehicle would have shuttled up to 16 astronauts at a time to the base and back. Horizon never progressed past the feasibility stage in an official capacity.”
However, just like George had lied to Judith, he in turn learned in 2014 that he was lied to about the actual purpose of Project Horizon: “[It] was a study to determine the feasibility of constructing a science/military based on the Moon. On June 8, 1959, a group of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) produced for the U.S. Department of the Army a report entitled Project Horizon, a U.S. Army Study for the Establishment of a Lunar Military Outpost.
“The project proposal states the requirements as: The lunar outpost is required to develop and protect potential United States interests on the moon; to develop techniques in moon-based surveillance of the earth and space, in communications relay, and in operations on the surface of the moon; to serve on a base for exploration of the moon, for further exploration into space and for military operations on the moon if required; and to support scientific investigations on the moon.”
     *   *   *
     “When I had been in the Army, I was assigned to work on top secret military and satellite work,” George tells me, “the FBI did routine checks. One of our neighbors told Judith that the FBI visited them but were told not to let us know of their inquiries. Apparently, you were on their ‘watch list’--based on your ‘radical’ writings, I assume. I learned from my boss at the Signal Corps that my top-secret clearance was in jeopardy. Granting my clearance took about a month longer than normal, but eventually it was granted.”
     Meanwhile, I was placed on the FBI’s RI (Round-up Index), though I had broken no law. Who knows, maybe it was because I published a cartoon depicting a man sitting at a desk, speaking on the phone: “I'm very sorry, but we of the FBI are powerless to act in a case of oral-genital intimacy unless it has in some way obstructed interstate commerce.”
     When Life magazine ran a favorable profile of me in 1968, an FBI agent sent a poison-pen letter to the editor: “To classify Krassner as some sort of ‘social rebel’ is far too cute. He's a nut, a raving, unconfined nut.” But in 1969, the FBI's previous attempt at mere character assassination escalated to a more literal approach. This was not included in my own Co-Intel-Pro (Counter-Intelligence Program) files but, rather, a separate FBI project calculated to cause rifts between the black and Jewish communities.
     The FBI had produced a WANTED poster featuring a large swastika. In the four square spaces of the swastika were photos of Yippie founders Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin and me, and SDS (Students for a Democratic Society) leader Mark Rudd. Underneath the swastika was this headline--LAMPSHADES! LAMPSHADES! LAMPSHADES!--and this message:
     “The only solution to Negro problems in America would be the elimination of the Jews. May we suggest the following order of elimination? (After all, we've been this way before.) *All Jews connected with the Establishment. *All Jews connected with Jews connected with the Establishment. *All Jews connected with those immediately above. *All Jews except those in the Movement. *All Jews in the Movement except those who dye their skins black. *All Jews. Look out, Abbie, Jerry, Paul and Mark!” (Shades of Wernher von Braun.)
     It was approved by FBI director J. Edgar Hoover's top two aides: “Authority is granted to prepare and distribute on an anonymous basis to selected individuals and organizations in the New Left the leaflet submitted. Assure that all necessary precautions are taken to protect the Bureau as the source of these leaflets. This leaflet suggests facetiously the elimination of these leaders.” And, of course, if a black militant obtained that flyer and eliminated one of those “New Left leaders who are Jewish,” the FBI's bureaucratic ass would be covered: “We said it was a facetious suggestion, didn't we?”



     On top of that, my name was on a list of sixty-five “radical” campus speakers, released by the House Internal Security Committee. The blacklist was published in the New York Times, and picked up by newspapers across the country. It might have been a coincidence, but my campus speaking engagements stopped abruptly.



     	When I was assigned to write a piece for the Los Angeles Times, I titled it “I Was a Comedian for the FBI,” because I mentioned that I had once recognized a pair of FBI agents taking notes while I was performing at the Community Church in New York. My FBI files later stated that I “purported to be humorous about the government.” Since when did taxpayers provide the funds to cover the FBI’s theater critics squad? 



     The banner headline on the cover of that L.A. Times Sunday Calendar section blared out: Paul Krassner--“I Was a Communist for the FB!.” In the San Francisco Chronicle, columnist Herb Caen wrote, “Fearing Krassner would sue, the Times recalled and destroyed some 300,000 copies at a cost of about $100,000. Krassner would have laughed, not sued.” Or maybe I would've sued and laughed my ass off.



     *   *   *



     By 1963, George had risen to Chief Scientist, Astro-Electronics Division at the Signal Corps, and McGraw-Hill contacted him, asking if he would write a book. And indeed, he began working on Introduction to Space Communication, which became the world’s first book on that subject.



     “The problem was the incredible pace of technology,” he says. “While I was writing Chapter 5, the nuggets of wisdom in Chapter 2 were becoming obsolete. The last chapter was called ‘Ad Astra’ (Latin for ‘to the stars’), where I tried to forecast future technology. When the book was published in 1964, most of my future projections were already obsolete. Darwin had no idea about the speed of evolution when applied to technology. By the way, more copies of the book were sold in Russia than in the United States.”



     On George’s last active project, he worked with the original seven astronauts. He was program manager at Simmonds Precision, responsible for the design of the fuel gauging system on the command module where the astronauts were housed. In 1972, Apollo 17, the eleventh manned mission, was the sixth and final lunar landing in the Apollo program. “We were on an extremely tight schedule, and my team worked nearly eighty hours with virtually no sleep to finish on time. We received a rare commendation and bonus from NASA for superior performance ahead of schedule and below budget.”



     Gordon Cooper--one of those seven original astronauts—had piloted the longest and final Mercury space flight in 1963, becoming the first American to sleep in orbit. “He gave me a rare souvenir,” George reminds me, “a dehydrated oatmeal cookie the size of a large dice that he had on a space mission. During a family dinner, I passed around the cookie for everyone to see. Dad was hard of hearing and didn’t hear the story, so he popped the space cookie into his mouth, and it was gone before I could get any words out of my mouth. It was pure grief when it happened, but funny now.”



     As I write this in 2014, George is 85, and if a movie were to be made about him, he’d like to be portrayed by Matt Damon. In October 1988, he was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer and given three years to live, but his daughter Devra, a naturopath, convinced him to meet with a macrobiotic counselor, and overnight he changed his diet and lifestyle. Now it’s twenty-six years later.



     He played tennis until six months ago, when he discontinued after a bad fall, because he was playing too aggressively. Currently, his exercise consists of taking walks and lifting dumbbells, though not simultaneously. He remains active, doing business seminars for adult education, providing legal plans for families, small businesses and employees, and calling square dances. But not for helicopters. Or drones.




The Six Dumbest Decisions of My Life

     I’m talking here about seriously dumb decisions, not those minor regrets like that time in 1970 when Esquire magazine assigned me to fly to New Mexico where director Monte Hellman was filming Two-Lane Blacktop, about street-racing. Among the actors was a pair of musicians, James Taylor as a driver, and Dennis Wilson as a mechanic. They both agreed to be interviewed, besides screenwriter Rudy Wurlitzer and others.
     During a conversation with Taylor about not laughing at jokes, he said, “My brother once told me a joke that made me laugh.”
     “Wait, don’t tell me now,” I said. “Let’s save it for the interview.”
     However, I was supposed to reveal behind the scenes of making the movie, but I learned that there were a couple of violations of law: A few members of the cast had been tripping on magic mushrooms; and a 17-year-old actress, Laurie Bird, who played “The Girl,” had sex with two members of the crew. Nine years later she would commit suicide.
     Anyway, I decided not to write the article--I was a reporter, not a snitch–-and never did get a chance to do any interviews. Nor did I ever hear the joke that James Taylor’s brother told him and made him laugh. I was mildly disappointed, but what follows are half a dozen of my really dangerous dumb decisions that continue to make me humble.
     1. Early one morning in 1963, at my tiny apartment on the Lower East Side of New York (now the East Village), I was in bed with a young woman I had met at a party, when the phone rang. It was her boyfriend, a lower-echelon Mafioso. He asked if I knew where she was. I told him no, even as she was cuddling next to me. He said he would check his source and call me right back. A few minutes later, he did.
“You were seen with her last night. You spent the night with her. She didn't come home last night. You punk!”
He said that he was coming to my office a few blocks away–-which is where he thought he was calling me–-to talk about it. I told her she'd better leave, and I rushed to the office, but he was already waiting outside the “Mad building” [where MAD magazine was published], peering through the locked outside door into the lobby, expecting the elevator door to open and me to step out and open the door for him. Instead he saw me on the sidewalk coming toward him.
“What are you doing out here?” he said.
“Well, I came out just a minute ago, but you weren't here.”
“I was calling you up because you didn't come out.”
“Oh–-I figured you had the address wrong, so I took a walk around the block.”
“Let's go to your apartment.”
“Don't you want to come up to my office?”
“I said. ‘Let's go to your apartment.’”
“You don't expect to find her there?”
“She leaves traces wherever she goes. By the way, do you have a telephone at your apartment?”
“Oh, yeah, well, it happens to be the same number as my office, incidentally.”
There was a certain tension between us while we were walking to my apartment.
“Tell me,” he said, “do you have many friends who smoke Tareyton cigarettes?”
I suddenly realized what he meant by “She leaves traces.” At the apartment, she was gone, but the bed was unmade and he couldn't help but notice the semen stain on the sheet. Which, of course, was no proof that it was she who had been there. However, the ashtray was filled with Tareyton cigarette butts.
“Do you smoke Tareytons?”
“No,” I answered, “I don't smoke any cigarettes.”
“I guess I caught you with your pants down, didn't I?”
He picked up the phone and dialed a number. He was calling her mother. “I found him,” he said. “What should I do, throw 'im out the window?” I was scared that he might actually do it. He hung up the phone and I didn't know what to expect. I thought, How could a realist have gotten himself into such an unrealistic situation?
We proceeded to have a discussion.
“I got the horns,” he yelled. “I gotta do something! It ain't manly!”
“Look, restraint itself can be a form of manliness.”
“You know,” he said, “I could arrange to have you killed while I was having dinner with your mother and father.”
“Well, actually, they're not having too many people over to the house these days.”
His low chuckle in response to that wisecrack marked a positive turning point in our conversation. He finally forgave me, and we shook hands. Then he borrowed twenty dollars, which we both knew I would never get back, but it was worth not being thrown out the window. I had known he was her boyfriend, and so I vowed never to risk sleeping with a gangster’s girlfriend, especially if she smoked cigarettes;

2. In 1979, I covered the trial of Dan White, )who had assassinated two progressive government officials in San Francisco--Mayor George Moscone (in 1975, as a state senator, he authored a bill to decriminalize marijuana) and Supervisor Harvey Milk (a dedicated gay activist)—and yet, after an incompetent prosecution and a shrewd defense, White was sentenced to only seven years.
That evening, I was unwinding at home, smoking a joint and preparing to write my final report for the Bay Guardian. My reverie was suddenly interrupted by a phone call from Mike Weiss. We had become friends during the trial, which he had covered for Time and Rolling Stone. He was calling from a phone booth across the street from City Hall. I could hear crowds screaming and sirens wailing behind his voice.
He had to yell: “There’s a riot going on! You should get here right away!”
Reluctantly, I took a cab. When I arrived at Civic Center, there were a dozen police cars that had been set on fire, which in turn set off their alarms, underscoring the shouts from a mob of 5,000 gay protesters. On the night that Milk was murdered, they had been among the 30,000 who marched silently to City Hall for a candlelight vigil. Now they were in the middle of a post-verdict riot, utterly furious.
But where were the cops? They were all fuming inside City Hall--where their commander had instructed them to stay–-armed prisoners watching helplessly as angry demonstrators broke the glass trying to ram their way through the locked doors.
     I spotted Weiss and a student from his magazine-writng class, Marilee Strong. The three of us circulated through the crowd. Standing in the middle of the intersection, Chronicle columnist Warren Hinckle was talking with a police official, and he beckoned me to join them. I gathered from their conversation that the cops were about to be released from City Hall. Some were already out. One kept banging his baton on the phone booth where Weiss was calling in his story, and he had to wave his press card before the cop would leave.
I found Marilee and suggested that we get away from the area. As we walked north on Polk Street, the police were beginning to march slowly in formation not too far behind us. But the instant they were out of view from City Hall, they broke ranks and started running toward us, hitting the metal pole of a bus stop with their billy clubs, making loud, scary clangs.
“We better run,” I told Marilee.
“Why? They’re not gonna hit us.”
“Yes, they are! Run! Hurry!”
The police had been let out of their cage and they were absolutely enraged. Marilee got away, but I was struck with a nightstick on the outside of my right knee. I fell to the ground. The cop ran off to injure as many other cockroaches in his kitchen as he could. Another cop came charging and he yelled at me, “Get up! Get up!”
“I’m trying to!” 
He made a threatening gesture with his billy club, and when I tried to protect my head with my arms, he jabbed me viciously on the exposed right side of my ribs. Oh, God, the pain! The cops were running amuck now, in an orgy of indiscriminate sadism, swinging their clubs wildly and screaming, “Get the fuck outa here, you fuckin' faggots, you motherfuckin' cocksuckers!”
I managed to drag myself along the sidewalk. It felt like an electric cattle prod was stuck between my ribs. Marilee drove me to a hospital emergency ward. X-rays indicated that I had a fractured rib and a punctured lung. 
The City of San Francisco was sued for $4.3 million by a man who had been a peaceful observer at the riot following the verdict. He was walking away from the Civic Center area when a cop yelled, “We’re gonna kill all you faggots!”–-and beat him on the head with his nightstick. He was awarded $125,000.
     I had wanted to sue the city, but an attorney requested $75 for a filing fee, and I didn’t have it. I was too foolish not to borrow it, and I decided to forego the lawsuit. I must’ve been crazy.

     3. In 1985, after living in San Francisco for sixteen years, I moved to a walk street in Venice, a block-and-a-half walk to the beach. I rented a top-floor tiny two-room apartment consisting of a kitchen/office where I could see the ocean and a living-room/bedroom which came with a convertible sofa. The bathroom had a bathtub/shower. 
     One afternoon, I took a bus to Santa Monica to eat at a little soul-food restaurant in a food court and to see a Woody Allen movie. When I returned home, I walked up the steps to the top floor, and when I opened the door to my “penthouse” apartment, it was filled with smoke. I had stupidly, utterly recklessly, left a candle burning in a glass ashtray on the arm of the sofa. I didn’t forget to do that. I chose to leave it that way.
     The ashtray had broken in half from the heat, and the sofa was burning, although asbestos material had prevented it from being on fire in a way that would spread the flames. I ran down the steps and got the fire extinguisher off the wall in the hall, ran back up and sprayed the sofa.
     “You should be ashamed of yourself,” I said to myself.
     I was grateful that only the sofa had been destroyed. Also, my pride in expanded consciousness had disintegrated. I’ve never quite forgiven myself for having endangered the lives and property of the tenants in the other four apartments. I had ignored the concept of cause and effect. My bad. Immensely. 

     4. On the morning of April 1st, 1995, I flew to San Francisco. I was scheduled to emcee a benefit for Jack Kerouac’s daughter, Jan, who had been on dialysis treatment for the last few years. On that sunny afternoon, I was stoned in Washington Square Park, wearing the MAD magazine jacket that my daughter Holly had given me for Christmas. The smiling face of Alfred E. Neuman--stating his renowned philosophy, “What--me worry?”--graced the back of my jacket
I was waiting for the arrival of the annual Saint Stupid Day Parade, led this year by Grand Marshal Ken Kesey in an open-topped convertible. The event was sponsored by the First Church of the Last Laugh. Their sound equipment was surrounded by yellow plastic tape warning, ”Police Line--Do Not Cross.” Somebody in a clown costume handed me a three-foot section of that tape.
     The celebration featured music, comedy and a traditional free brunch, along with such favorite rituals as the Sock Exchange and the Leap of Faith. Kesey was also in town to speak at the benefit, which was held only because Jan happened to be the daughter of a ground-breaking literary celebrity, even though he had abandoned her mother when she was pregnant with Jan.
     I said to my friend Julius, who drove me there, “It’s not enough any more just to be a sperm donor.”
Jan had met her father only twice. The first time, she was nine. The second time, six years later, he sat there, drinking a fifth of whiskey and watching The Beverly Hillbillies. Jan would eventually die of kidney failure at the age of forty-four, never having fulfilled her fantasy of becoming drinking buddies with her father, who died when she was a teenager.
     Now, backstage, someone I knew handed me a baggie of what I assumed to be marijuana. I thanked her and put it in my pocket. Ah, yes, one of the perks of the benefit biz. Later, as the final members of the audience were straggling out of the theater, I was sitting with Julius in his car in the parking area at Fort Mason Center.
     He was busy rolling a joint in a cigar-box on the dashboard with the map light on. There was a police car circling around in the distance, but we unwisely ignored it. Suddenly, a moment later, there was a fist knocking heavily on the passenger-side window, and a flashlight shining in my eyes. Shit! Fuck! Caught!
We were ordered outside and, with our arms outstretched against the side of the car, with the face of Alfred E. Neuman smiling at the cop and asking, “What--me worry?” And indeed, the cop was worried. He asked me if I had anything sharp in my pockets.
“Because,” he explained, “I’m gonna get very mad if I get stuck,” obviously referring to a hypodermic needle.
“No,” I said, “there’s only a pen in this pocket”--gesturing toward the left with my head--“and keys in that one.”
He found the coiled-up three feet of yellow plastic tape warning “Police Line--Do Not Cross,” and said, “Where’d you get this?”
“At the Saint Stupid Day Parade.”
“What’s it for?”
“To keep people away.”
But then he found the baggie. And, to my surprise, it contained magic mushrooms. He examined the contents. Then, reeking with sarcasm, he said, “So you like mushrooms, huh?” Under the circumstances, it was such a ridiculous question that I almost laughed, but I realized that, from his point of view, this was a serious offense.
Julius was given a $50 citation for possession of marijuana, but I was arrested on the spot, handcuffed behind my back, and my Miranda rights were read to me. I stood there, heart pounding fast and mouth terminally dry, trying to keep my balance on the cusp of reality and unreality. Fortunately, attorney Doron Weinberg got me off with a $100 fine and nothing on my permanent record.
But I finally understood what that cop meant when he snarled, “So you like mushrooms, huh?” His question was asked with such archetypal hostility that it kept reverberating inside my head. So you like mushrooms, huh? It was not as though I had done anything that might harm another human being. This was simply an authority figure’s need to control. But control what? My pleasure? Or was it deeper than that?
What was his actual message? Back through eons of ancestors--all the way back to what psychedelic researcher Terence McKenna called “the unstoned apes”--this cop was continuing a never-ending attempt to maintain the status quo. He had unintentionally revealed the true nature of the threat he perceived. What he really said to me was, “So you like the evolution of human consciousness, huh?”
     “Well, yeah,” I thought, “now that you mention it, I do. I mean, when you put it like that--So you like the evolution of human consciousness, huh?--sure, I do. I like it a whole lot.” Too bad I had remained silent instead of using my instinct and advising Julius, “Let’s get the hell out of here.”

     5. Once, in the men’s room at an airport, I couldn’t help but notice a man standing at a urinal a urinals away from the one where I was carefully aiming my stream with my left hand onto the round marzipan-like disinfectant. But he was allowing his penis to aim itself, because he happened to be busy using both hands to floss his teeth. It was a monument to multi-tasking. 
     I’m embarrassed to admit that, rather then flossing, I would use a dollar bill to clean between my teeth. Instead, I was actually adding bacteria to my mouth, thereby giving a new, literal meaning to the concept of “dirty money.” As a result, my teeth were in terrible shape.


     I had known better. Back in 1971, publisher Stewart Brand had invited Ken Kesey and me to co-edit The Last Supplement to the Whole Earth Catalog. Our managing editor, Hassler (Ron Bevirt’s Merry Prankster name), introduced me to the fine art of flossing.


     “I began cleaning between my teeth with dental floss, and then brushing carefully after every meal for the last nine years,” he told me. “Dental floss is really important because it removes particles of food from between the teeth that can’t be dislodged by the brush. It’s this crap between the teeth that really causes decay.”


     Although I didn’t practice what he preached, I immediately assigned him to write a piece about the process of flossing for The Last Supplement. After all, the Whole Earth Catalog was devoted to informing its readers about a variety of New Age tools. And floss was definitely a useful tool. “Floss comes in two thicknesses,” Hassler wrote. “Thin, called Dental Floss; and thick, called Dental Tape. Recently, I found Dental Floss Unwaxed. All the floss and tape I’ve used in the past were waxed. I find that I prefer the waxed because it slips in and out between my teeth cleanly without leaving any of the floss behind, which I find to be a problem with unwaxed floss. I’ve realized the importance of my teeth in the service of my habit. Munch, slurp, slobber, drool…”


     In 1987, I was a keynote speaker at the annual International Society for Humor Studies conference, held in Tempe, Arizona. I had dinner with a group of five staffers from the Russian humor magazine Krokodil at the Holiday Inn. They all ordered the specialty of the house—pork ribs—which came with huge bibs. The editor was given a bib with the words “Miss America” on it. The art director got a bib with a big iconic “S” for Superman.


     They were really getting a dose of our culture. As we walked along the salad bar, one of the Russians stopped at the corn chowder and asked me, “Is this typical American soup?” As the others gathered around, I didn’t quite know how to answer. “I’m sorry, I don’t know,” I said. “I’m sure it’s typical somewhere in the country.” And then I remembered that multi-tasking man at the airport urinal. “In America,” I told the Russian, “corn chowder comes with dental floss that has little pieces of corn embedded in it, so if you get hungry between meals you can floss and have a snack at the same time.” 


     A few years before I met my wife, Nancy, she had gone to a dentist who required all new patients to take a two-session course in flossing and oral health. Only when he was satisfied that patients would be capable of caring for their teeth properly would he then make their first cleaning appointment. Nancy learned the technique, and recently a friend named her “the Floss Queen.” We came across an ad stating that “If you follow a vegan diet, you may opt for Eco-Dent’s GentleFloss, which uses beeswax instead of animal products.” Who knew?


     The irony behind all this is that Medicare doesn’t cover any dental procedures, even though dentists emphasize how bad teeth can cause illness in other, internal parts of the body. For example, a research team from Columbia University’s School of Public Health released the results of a three-year study of 420 men and women, concluding that the improvement of gum health can help slow the development of atherosclerosis, the build-up of cholesterol-rich plaque along artery walls, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes.


     I still regret that I would eat candy without flossing afterward. Especially a Clark Bar, which could cause a cavity and fill it simultaneously.

     6. I had taped an interview on an electric recorder-transcriber, plus a battery-operated cassette recorder as a back-up precaution, which turned out to be an absolute necessity when the electric recorder conked out right in the middle.
     Later on, I bought a new one to replace it, but first I had to get rid of the old one. My desk consisted of a wooden door supported by a couple of two-drawer filing cabinets. I was just too damn lazy to take all the equipment and books off the desk so that I could move the desk toward me and pull up the wire from behind it.
So I simply cut the wire with a pair of scissors. Bzzzzzt!!! I was shocked, but not injured. Though the recorder had conked out, I had incredibly left the wire still plugged into a socket on the surge protector. Where the scissors had cut the wire, parts of the metal had melted away just a couple of inches from my hand. I might’ve been electrocuted. Yikes!
I could’ve been killed, and the cause would’ve been a simple lack of the practice of mindfulness that I treasure so much. Instead, I had emptied my mind. Oops, wrong discipline. But I was still alive, and I thanked God for that. And then I heard a resplendent voice booming through the clouds: “SHUT UP, YOU SUPERSTITIOUS FOOL! “

Alternative Facts
     Between the choice of a one-man-one-vote (Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia) and fake news of Weapons of Mass Destruction, invasion of Iraq, and horror of ISIS, George Bush was elected president in the year 2000. It was due to the electoral college (a rigged system which originally intended to prevent slaves from voting and evolved to gerrymandering), even though Bush’s opponent, Al Gore, won the national popular vote. 
     Hillary Clinton was elected senator that year, and she announced that the first thing she would do was to get rid of the electoral college. A few years later, as a columnist for the New York Press, I sent her a letter asking about the status of that promise. She didn’t reply.
     On November 8, 2016, a crooked businessman, liar extraordinaire, bragging pussy-grabber, make-America-white-again, anti-choice, anti-Semite, false Christian, climate-change hoaxer, Nobamacare, homophobic, apprentice politician, fascist tweets, and Vladimir Putin’s “useful idiot,” namely Donald Trump, who was elected as an insanely narcissistic dictator based on the electoral college, whereas his opponent, Hillary Clinton, won the national popular vote by “more than three million” individuals.
     Irony 	lives.
     But an incredibly mean monster inadvertently awakened a sleeping population to counteract the essence of evil with love, laughs, and law, fueled by the aid of true news. Incidentally, Putin had 88 journalists murdered. No wonder Trump told him, “It’s an honor to be with you.” Now Putin wanted Obama’s new sanctions on Russia to be reprieved.
     National Security Adviser Michael Flynn had discussed it with the Russian ambassador a month before Trump took office. Although General Flynn joined his campaign and shared criminal secrets, he denied them to the FBI. It was a felony offense. The Justice Department warned Trump that Flynn had misled Mike Pence, and that Flynn could be vulnerable to blackmail. Trump asked Flynn to resign, and yet he offered his job back when he got out of prison. Why? Because Flynn was the scapegoat, taking the fall for the president and vice-president. He preferred a trial with immunity since they knew all. Pence said Flynn lied and that was a lie. 
     If Trump and Pence were both to be kicked out of the White House, the next in line would be the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. Steve Bannon described him as “a limp-dick motherfucker who was born in a petri dish at the Heritage Foundation.” In turn, Trunp’s communicator Anthony Scaramucci boasted, “I’m not Steve Bannon, I’m not trying to suck my own cock.” Ah, but Bannon said he wanted to destroy Ryan.
     Hallelujah!
     Trump once tried to patent “You’re fired.” Professional hater Bannon resigned. Back to running his Breitbart News. He had taken over the original right-wing website, Breitbart.com, after the death of editor Andrew Breitbart, who ironically was adopted and raised as a proud Jew.
Orson Bean is my oldest living friend. He became a Christian libertarian conservative, and we’ve had an ongoing email dialogue about religion, but he’s still a Christian and I’m still an atheist. Not a militant atheist, as I used to be, though. I changed when I realized that Martin Luther King was a Christian, yet I was inspired by his actions, and George Lincoln Rockwell, head of the American Nazi Party, was an agnostic, yet I abhorred what he stood for. It no longer mattered to me what anybody’s religious belief was, only how they treated others. Either kind or cruel. That simple.
     I decided to email Orson: “If you can arrange for me to interview Andrew Breitbart”--his son-in-law--“I’ll believe in God.” Orson must’ve forwarded my email to Breitbart, because he sent me an email saying, “Apparently there is a God,” with his own phone number. I called, we spoke, and he agreed to do an interview. My only ground rule would be that neither of us would interrupt the other. I contacted Steve Randall, my editor at Playboy, and I got the assignment. I immediately sent an email to Orson with the good news. The Subject line was “Praise the fucking Lord.” Amen.
I Played Thomas Jefferson’s Violin


At a unique Heroes Convention, I met Lindsay Wagner, star of The Bionic Woman. She was unaware that the CIA served as technical adviser to her series, but she spoke poignantly of the positive influence that her TV alter-ego had on young amputees she visited in hospitals.
I also met Tom Laughlin, of Billy Jack movie fame. A couple of years later, he and his wife Delores Taylor invited me to a large dinner party.
     They were Thomas Jefferson enthusiasts. In their home, there was Thomas Jefferson's furniture, Thomas Jefferson's silverware, Thomas Jefferson's recipes--we started with peanut soup--and even Thomas Jefferson's violin.
     I mentioned playing the violin as a child, and Laughlin invited me to play this one. I hadn't held a violin for twenty-five years, not since I had used it as a prop when I started doing stand-up comedy, and four decades had passed since that concert in Carnegie Hall. It felt like a previous incarnation. But now Billy Jack himself was handing me Thomas Jefferson's violin. How could I resist?
“I'd like to dedicate this to Thomas Jefferson's slaves,” I said.
And then I played the only thing I felt competent enough to perform--“Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.” While I was playing, I stood and, as unobtrusively as possible, balancing on my left foot, I scratched my left leg with my right foot.
     It was a private joke between me and the god of Absurdity.

form a judgment, and later they may get to see whether their judg-
ment is correct. When asked, they can tell you clear reasons (typically
post hoc justifications) as to why they decided the way they did. The
wine expert can say reasons as well, but the evidence for taste is not
really all that objective. (Of course, the evidence may be found after
the judgment is made. People are not always entirely rational.)

To learn to make objective judgments, one needs constant feed-
back either from a teacher or from a colleague or from reality. One
needs to think about what was decided and why. People who are good
at this are good at it because they have analyzed their successes and
failures and they can articulate their reasoning. Learning requires re-
peated practice.

SOCIAL PROCESSES

1. Influence: Understanding how others respond to your requests
and recognizing consciously and unconsciously how to improve
the process

Human interaction is one of the most important skills of all. We
regularly interact with family, friends, colleagues, bosses, romantic in-
terests, professors, service personnel, and strangers. Communicating
effectively is very important to any success we might want to have in
any area of life. But, we do not know why we say what we say, nor do
we really understand how we are being perceived by others. We just
talk and listen and go on our way. Some people are loved by everyone
and others are despised. It is wrong to assume that we know what
image we project or that we are easily capable of altering the way we
behave so that we will be perceived differently.

How do we learn to become conscious of inherently unconscious
behavior? One can learn to behave differently if one becomes con-
sciously aware of the mistakes one is making. Watching others, watch-
ing oneself, thinking about how to improve—all this helps one make
subconscious behavior into conscious behavior.

We unintentionally return to standard ways of acting in various
situations. A wallflower at a party doesn’t decide to be a wallflower—it
is simply behavior she is comfortable with. If no one is harmed by

(B) must - for any disputed portion of the presentence report or other controverted matter - rule on the dispute or determine that
a ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not affect sentencing, or because the court will not consider the matter in
sentencing; and

[*931] (C) must append a copy of the court's determinations under this rule to any copy of the presentence report made

available to the Bureau of Prisons. 394

The Advisory Committee recommended no changes to these rules. >

Discussion:

The CVRA entitles victims to be heard on disputed Federal Sentencing Guidelines (Guidelines) issues and, as a consequence,
to review parts of the presentence report relevant to those issues. The CVRA gives victims the right to be reasonably heard at
any public proceeding in the district court involving ... sentencing. 7°© The CVRA provision (among other things) codifies
the right of crime victims to give in court what is known as a victim impact statement. 397

The victim's right to be heard, however, is not narrowly circumscribed to just impact information. To the contrary, the right
conferred is a broad one - to be reasonably heard at the sentencing proceeding. The victim's right to be reasonably heard
implicitly includes a right for the victim to speak to disputed Guidelines issues. As Senator Kyl explained, the victim's right
includes the right to make sentencing recommendations:

When a victim invokes this right during ... sentencing proceedings, it is intended that he or she be allowed to provide all three
types of victim impact: the character of the victim, the impact of the crime on the victim, the victim's family and the
community, and sentencing recommendations. 37°

A sentencing recommendation will often directly implicate Guidelines issues, particularly where a court gives significant
weight to the Guidelines calculation (as most currently do). 7°? For example, if the victim wishes to recommend a sixty-month
sentence when the maximum guideline range is only thirty months, that sentencing recommendation may be meaningless
unless a [*932] victim can provide a basis for recalculating the Guidelines or departing or varying *°° from the Guidelines.

Congress intended the victim's right to be heard to be construed broadly, as Senator Feinstein stated: The victim of crime, or
their counsel, should be able to provide any information, as well as their opinion, directly to the court concerning the ...
sentencing of the accused. 4°! Again, it is hard to see how victims can meaningfully provide any information that would
have a bearing on the sentence without being informed of the Guidelines calculations that likely will drive the sentence.

Lebanese army colors and had them hide overnight in the moshav’s orchards, a
hundred yards from the road on the Lebanese side of the frontier. The next
morning, when we got confirmation the convoy was on its way, they crossed
and stationed themselves on the road, lifted the hood of one of the vehicles and
made as if they were trying to repair engine trouble. Both the blocking forces
were in half-tracks with heavy machine-guns in case the convoy chose to stand
and fight.

What we didn’t count on was a Lebanese driver, ina VW Beetle as I recall,
puttering along the road shortly after Yoni’s team crossed. The man waved at
them. Quite rightly, Yoni let him drive on. Along with the other obvious reasons
not to fire on a civilian VW, he didn’t want to alert the Syrians and their hosts
there was danger ahead. But the Lebanese motorist, as well as a group of nearby
farmers, were suspicious enough to deliver a warning that there were a couple
of stalled Land Rovers on the side of the road. The convoy halted shortly after
passing Mookie’s force, hidden in a field a few dozen yards away.

Had I not been in the command post, I’m pretty sure what would have
happened next. The mission would have been called off. This time, I was the
one in direct contact with all three teams. Even before I gave the order, Yoni
had anticipated it. He and Uzi turned west to confront the convoy. In a brief
initial exchange of gunfire, one of Uzi’s men was wounded, not seriously, in the
leg. But with Mookie’s team firing from behind and Yoni’s and Uzi’s men in
front, the convoy was trapped, and the Syrians captured.

The safest way back into Israel would have been the way the force had
entered. But Yoni and Uzi realized the main imperative was to get the Syrians
out as quickly as possible. At a not-inconsiderable cost to a pair of American
limousines, Uzi drove each of them, with a total of five Syrian officers, through
a boulder-strewn field across the border.

The Syrians included three senior members of the Operations Department of
the General Staff, and two from Air Force intelligence. Israel made an
immediate offer to swap them for our pilots, though how enthusiastically ’m
not sure. With this kind of leverage on our side, it seemed unlikely the Syrians
would do further harm to our pilots. Our intelligence officers were keen to get
every bit of information they could before sending the Syrians home. It would
be a year later before the exchange was done. Yoni received a well-deserved
tzalash for his role in the mission.

For three and a half decades following the end of the Maoist era, China adhered to

Deng Xiaoping’s policies of “reform and opening to the outside world” and “peaceful
development.” After Deng retired as paramount leader, these principles continued to
guide China’s international behavior in the leadership eras of Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao.
Admonishing Chinese to “keep your heads down and bide your time,” these Party leaders
sought to emphasize that China’s rapid economic development and its accession to “great
power” status need not be threatening to either the existing global order or the interests
of its Asian neighbors. However, since Party general secretary Xi Jinping came to power in
2012, the situation has changed. Under his leadership, China has significantly expanded
the more assertive set of policies initiated by his predecessor Hu Jintao. These policies not
only seek to redefine China’s place in the world as a global player, but they also have put
forward the notion of a “China option” (# #38) that is claimed to be a more efficient
developmental model than liberal democracy.

While Americans are well acquainted with China’s quest for influence through the projection
of diplomatic, economic, and military power, we are less aware of the myriad ways Beijing
has more recently been seeking cultural and informational influence, some of which could
undermine our democratic processes. These include efforts to penetrate and sway—through
various methods that former Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull summarized as
“covert, coercive or corrupting”—a range of groups and institutions, including the Chinese
American community, Chinese students in the United States, and American civil society
organizations, academic institutions, think tanks, and media.

Some of these efforts fall into the category of normal public diplomacy as pursued by many
other countries. But others involve the use of coercive or corrupting methods to pressure
individuals and groups and thereby interfere in the functioning of American civil and
political life.

It is important not to exaggerate the threat of these new Chinese initiatives. China has not
sought to interfere in a national election in the United States or to sow confusion or inflame
polarization in our democratic discourse the way Russia has done. For all the tensions in the
relationship, there are deep historical bonds of friendship, cultural exchange, and mutual
inspiration between the two societies, which we celebrate and wish to nurture. And it is
imperative that Chinese Americans—who feel the same pride in American citizenship as do
other American ethnic communities—not be subjected to the kind of generalized suspicion
or stigmatization that could lead to racial profiling or a new era of McCarthyism. However,

The phone rang in our apartment in Palo Alto at 4:30 in the morning. We had
been in the US for barely six weeks. It was the Sixth of October 1973: Yom
Kippur, the holiest date on the Jewish calendar. I was still a bit groggy from the
night before. We had been out at a get-to-know-you event for some of the
several dozen Israelis, and several hundred American Jewish students, at
Stanford. While I only vaguely recognized the voice on the other end of the line,
her words instantly jolted me awake: “The boss is busy,” she said. “But he
wants you to know. A war has started back home.”

Her boss was Motta Gur, who was by now Israel’s military attaché in
Washington and was my nominal commander for my period in the United
States. “I need to talk to Motta,” I said. She passed him the phone. “I want you
to know I’m going back,” I told him. Motta’s reply took my mind back 15
months, to our on-again-off-again mission to abduct the Syrian officers, with
Motta and Dado in the command post, intent on reining in the “young bulls” of
the sayeret. “Ehud,” he said, “from what I’m hearing, I don’t think we are
missing a major war.”

“What’s this we?” I said. Motta was a general, at the upper reaches of the
armed forces, officially posted to Washington. I was a young officer, just
starting to work my way up the chain of field command. “I can’t afford to miss
even a non-major war,” I said. “Pll check in with you when I get to New York.”

“Major” would turn out to be, if anything, an understatement. Yet all I knew,
as I kissed Nava and Michal goodbye and got a cab to San Francisco airport,
was that Israel was again at war. By the time I joined the swarm of Israelis
around the El Al desk at Kennedy eight hours later, the picture was clearer, and
more worrying with each new report from back home. Surprise attacks by Syria
and Egypt — armies we’d not just defeated, but humiliated, six years earlier —
had pinned down and pushed back our forces on the Golan Heights and in the
Sinai. Without any advance call-up, many reservists were only now reaching the
front lines.

As hundreds of people pressed for seats on the El Al flight, I was fortunate to
receive a boost up the pecking order from another man in line. Since the Sabena
operation, the existence of Sayeret Matkal had become a bit less secret. Still, the
identity of the sayeret commander was known to just a few people outside the
unit. So skittish were the army security people that before I’d left for Stanford,

Media Magic: How a Democrat Pedophile 
Became a 'Trump Scandal' 
Strangely, the media have suddenly taken an intense interest in the case of pedophile and 
major Democratic donor Jeffrey Epstein. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029907 
In 2005, the Palm Beach police were told by the mother of a young girl in West Palm Beach 
that her daughter had been brought to the Democratic donor's mansion and asked to have 
sex with him for money. This kicked off an intensive, one-year undercover investigation. 
The police sifted through Epstein's garbage and interviewed 17 witnesses, including the 
housemen, who told of sex toys and dildos left behind after the underage girls left. One of 
Epstein's procurers, a 20-year-old local woman named Haley Robson, who was paid $200 
for every teenaged girl she brought to Jeffrey, was cooperating with police, telling them she 
was like Heidi Fleiss. They obtained statements from five of Epstein's young victims, who 
said they'd been paid $200 to $300 to engage in various sex acts with ...

operations with espionage. In one instance, after a visit to China supported by CAIFC, an
American congressional official was asked by two employees at CAIFC who facilitated his
trip to host them during a return visit to Washington. He obliged, and they were seemingly
satisfied, having shopped extensively during their stay. Subsequently, the Chinese embassy
officers who had arranged the congressional official’s visit to China with CAIFC were
arrested and expelled for trying to steal US weapons technology, causing the US official to
end all contact with CAIFC.

Current Era

Tensions in US-China relations subsided after the terrorist attack on America in September
2001 and subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq preoccupied the Bush administration
and Congress. Chinese and American leaders also proved to be sufficiently pragmatic to
reach common ground on advancing relations in mutually agreeable ways and managing
differences through a wide range of dialogues. Such exchanges only catalyzed visits by
more congressional members and staff delegations visits to China. At this time, members
often traveled to China in US government-—funded trips as guests of the US embassy. Some
member trips and very frequent staff delegation visits were authorized under provisions

of the Mutual Education and Cultural Exchange Act (MECEA) that were in line with the
guidance of congressional ethics committees.’ In addition to the work of the US-Asia
Institute, those organizing and facilitating staff delegations grew to include the Aspen
Institute, the National Committee on US-China Relations, and the US-China Policy
Foundation.”

China also increased its own capacity to engage Congress beyond trips. Having moved into
a new embassy in Washington in 2009, the Chinese embassy increased its congressional
affairs staff to twelve (as of 2011), while also retaining the lobbying services of the firm
Patton Boggs.'! During his time as ambassador, Zhou Wenzhong boasted that he had visited
some one hundred members of Congress in their home districts. When certain measures,
such as a bill that would have penalized China for being a “currency manipulator,” came
before Congress, the embassy’s in-house team’s efforts reflected what some US officials
called a much more “nuanced” and “sophisticated” understanding of the body. Whether or
not Chinese officials or lobbyists interacting with congressional offices endeavored to exert
influence by means beyond persuasion—such as by offering material benefits or threatening
to withdraw Chinese investments or other tangible benefits to the congressional district—
remained hard to discern given the very limited public reporting on such matters.”

Congress, for its part, had already formalized efforts to better understand China through

a variety of working groups. By 2006, both the House and the Senate had formed a
US-China Inter-Parliamentary Exchange Group, which conducted periodic exchanges with
China’s National People’s Congress. Also showing stronger American interest in China at
that time were the Congressional China Caucus (led by members tending to be critical

Belohlavek stated a probable cause would be needed to book
Epstein in the county Jail and would let me know as to when
it was needed. I explained my disapproval of the deal and not
being consulted prior to the deal being offered. However I
expressed that was only my opinion and the final approval

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023954.txt,"208 Teaching Minds

How do we choose who studies the elite subjects? We don’t.

Offer choices. Stop making lists of what one must know and start
putting students into situations where they can learn from experi-
ence while attempting to accomplish goals that they set out for them-
selves, just as people did before there were schools. Education has
always been the same: learning from experience with help from wiser
mentors. School has screwed that all up and it is time to go back to
basics.

So the “what” question is simple. We should teach children what
adults know that enables them to function in the world they inhabit.
This has much less to do with academic knowledge than it has to do
with practical, and often subconscious, knowledge of how to do a va-
riety of things in the social and physical and economic world we have
created.

Now let’s address the question of how to teach these things.

John Dewey noted, in 1916, that he had been talking about learn-
ing by doing for a long time, but nobody ever listened to him about
it—-which was exactly his point. He was frustrated about changing the
system. In 1916! Imagine how he would feel today.

It is not unreasonable to ask why the system never changes, and
who is making sure that it won’t change. The answer is obvious. So
many people have vested interests in things staying as they are that
the system basically cannot change—at least not of its own free will.

The President of the United States could help make the changes
needed, but he won’t. Here is a piece from then-Senator Obama’s
education speech given during his campaign in Dayton, Ohio, in 2008:

We will help schools integrate technology into their curriculum
so we can make sure public school students are fluent in the
digital language of the 21st-century economy. We’ll teach our
students not only math and science, but teamwork and critical
thinking and communication skills, because that’s how we’ll
make sure they’re prepared for today’s workplace.

Some advisor of his had read my writings and was quoting me on that
one. I usually say reasoning and not critical thinking, but this is taken
from my many speeches on education. And what has the President
actually done? He said in that same speech:

both approved broadening that rule to give all victims the right to speak. “87 (The Judicial Conference withdrew this proposed
rule to allow reconsideration in light of the CVRA.) The CVRA gave victims the right to be reasonably heard at sentencing.
Of course, the CVRA's obvious goal was to significantly expand the rights of crime victims. With respect to the right to speak
in particular, one of the CVRA's primary sponsors stated: this section would fail in its intent if courts determined that written,
rather than oral communication, could generally satisfy this right. 43° Yet, in the wake of all this, the Advisory Committee
now proposes a rule that does not guarantee that victims have the right to speak, leaving this to the courts to construe on a case-
by-case basis. This retreat on victims’ rights truly stands the CVRA on its head.

The Advisory Committee should directly state that victims have the right to speak at sentencing, as the only courts to have
reached the issue have held. 43° For [*940] instance, in United States v. Kenna, Judge Kozinski ‘4° explained that the
CVRA's legislative history discloses a clear congressional intent to give crime victims the right to speak at proceedings
covered by the CVRA. “4! The court first highlighted the following statement by Senator Kyl:

It is not the intent of the term reasonably in the phrase to be reasonably heard to provide any excuse for denying a victim
the right to appear in person and directly address the court. Indeed, the very purpose of this section is to allow the victim to
appear personally and directly address the court. 47

Senator Dianne Feinstein, another primary sponsor of the bill, remarked that Senator Kyl's understanding of the bill was [her]
understanding as well. +43

In addition to these floor statements, the Kenna court cited a committee report for the proposed constitutional amendment to
protect victims' rights. The Senate Report on the amendment - an amendment that contained language nearly identical to the
language in the eventually enacted CVRA - reads that:

The victim's right is to be heard. The right to make an oral statement is conditioned on the victim's presence in the courtroom
.... Victims should always be given the power to determine the form of the statement. Simply because a decision making body,
such as the court ... has a prior statement of some sort on file does not mean that the victim should not again be offered the
opportunity to make a further statement ... . The Committee does not intend that the right to be heard be limited to written
statements, because the victim may wish to communicate in other appropriate ways. +44

pursue avenues for negotiated peace with its immediate neighbours, getting the
popular support required would be all but impossible.

The window 1s still there. But it is only barely open.

I fear that I was right, as well, in predicting that our failure to secure a final
peace agreement with the Palestinians at Camp David might set back
peacemaking not just for a few months, but for many years. I have persisted in
trying, very hard, to make that particular prediction prove wrong. That was why,
despite intense pressure from my own political allies not to do so, I decided to
return to government in 2007 as Defence Minister. I remained in that role for
six years: mostly in the current, right-wing Likud government of my onetime
Sayeret Matkal charge, Bibi Netanyahu.

Much of what I say in this book about war and peace, security and Israel’s
future challenges, will make uncomfortable reading for Bibi. But very little of it
will surprise him, or his own Likud rivals further to the right, like Foreign
Minister Avigdor Lieberman and the Economy Minister, Naftali Bennett. I have
said almost all of it to them behind closed doors in the past few years, more than
once. When I finally decided to leave the political arena last year, it was largely
because I realized that they were guided by other imperatives. In the case of
Bibi, the most gifted politician with whom I’ve worked except for Clinton, the
priority was to stay in power. For Avigdor and Naftali, it was to supplant Bibi,
when the opportunity was ripe, as Likud leader and as Prime Minister. And
much too often — as with their hugely ill-advised recent proposal to amend
Israel’s basic law to define it explicitly as a Jewish state, and deny “national
rights” to non-Jews — the three of them have ended up competing for party
political points rather than weighing the serious future implications for the
country.

Peacemaking, as I discovered first-hand, requires taking risks. Statesmanship
requires risks. Politics, especially if defined simply as staying in power, is
almost always about the avoidance of risk.

If I end up in chains in Guantaénamo, I can live with that.

—EDWARD SNOWDEN, Hong Kong, 2013

URING HIS INTERVIEWS with Poitras and Greenwald in June,
Snowden said stoically, “If I am arrested, I am arrested.” His
fatalistic words notwithstanding, Snowden had made plans to seek
a haven from American justice well before his meeting them. As
early as May 24, 2013, he had suggested to Barton Gellman that
he was making arrangements with a foreign government. To that
end, he asked Gellman to insert an encrypted key in the Internet
version of the NSA exposé that Snowden proposed he write for The
Washington Post. He told him the purpose of the encrypted key was
to assist him with a foreign government. Snowden did not iden-
tify any foreign government to Gellman, but Gellman said he knew
that Snowden wanted to “seek asylum” overseas. He decided against
assisting him. “I can’t help him evade U.S. jurisdiction—I don’t want
to, and I can’t,” he later explained. “It’s not my job. It’s not the rela-
tionship. I am a journalist.”
Although Gellman suspected that Iceland might be the foreign
government in question, Snowden, as it turned out, had never con-

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012818.txt,"Across the globe, most people in these small scale societies offered some amount of the initial
pot. Across the globe, most people rejected really low offers. This shows the universal signature of
fairness: an expectation of sharing resources and a no-tolerance view of greed. Cultures differed with
respect to how much they shared and whether they rejected. Some societies offered, on average, close to
40%, while others offered as little as 15%. Some societies accepted virtually all offers, whereas others
rejected both low and even high offers. Even in more egalitarian societies, therefore, there 1s sensitivity to
unequal distributions. Even in egalitarian societies, there is a willingness to punish those who act
unfairly, greedily taking more than their fair share.

The work I have discussed on fairness is only a fraction of the growing body of scientific
evidence. What this research reveals is that a sense of fairness is part of human nature, appearing early in
development, but guided by experience toward a particular cultural form. When our desire for fairness or
equity combines with our competitive drive, envy often follows. Studies of the brain show how envy is
generated from this combination.

When healthy subjects sit in a brain scanner and learn about other individuals who have what they
desire, there is considerable activity in the anterior cingulate, and more activity in those who feel more
envious. This is not the envy center of the brain. There is no such area. But the recruitment of the anterior
cingulate in other social situations helps us understand what is going on more generally in the case of
envy. The anterior cingulate activates when we experience pain from social exclusion, but not when we
witness such pain in others. It is one of the areas that was activated in Chiao’s work on the differences in
pain empathy for those supporting either an egalitarian or hierarchical society. The anterior cingulate is
also involved when our minds are pulled in two different directions, a situation that arises when we are
forced to choose between two conflicting moral options — for example, a duty to save the lives of many
versus the prohibition of killing one person to save the lives of many. There is a common thread here that
unites these different experiences. Like our experience of social exclusion, envy is also a form of social
pain and to some, deeply painful, as it reveals a sense of deficiency in acquiring resources. Envy also
represents a situation in which our positive sense of self conflicts with the negative sense of self
engendered by social comparison. Our brain — and the anterior cingulate in particular — informs us that
we are less accomplished when compared with others. Envy is socially imposed pain generated by
comparison shopping.

Envy highlights what we don’t have, which fuels the system of desire, which seeks satisfaction.
Unsatisfied, envy runs wild. Unsatisfied, wanting keeps hunting for pleasure. Schadenfreude delivers

some prey.

Improvements Analysis — Building Improvements

Quality and Condition

The quality and condition of the subject is considered to be superior to that of competing properties.
The interior and exterior building improvements are considered to be of good quality and in good
condition based on our inspection.

Functional Utility

The improvements appear to be adequately suited to their current use, and there do not appear to be
any significant items of functional obsolescence.

Deferred Maintenance

A few items of deferred maintenance were identified during our inspection and based on discussions
with management. These include repairs and replacement to the parking garage ceiling, replacing the
wooden deck on the upper level Building A, and re-facing various portions of the marina jettys. Note
that a detailed description of the marina improvements will be discussed in the following section of
this report. To estimate the cost to cure deferred maintenance, we rely on construction estimates
from management as shown below.

Deferred Maintenance

Parking garage ceiling $40,000
Wooden deck repair/replacement $25,000
Marina decking and fendering repair/replace $96,000

Total $161,000

*Values expressed in United States Dollars

Planned Capital Expenditures

From 2013 to 2015, a total of $771,460.93 has been spent on various capital expenditures. The major
improvements over the past three years were $84,088 for exterior column replacement, $62,172 for
security cameras, $62,013 for marina bathrooms, and $281,950 for hand rail replacement. Upcoming
expenditures for various capital items considered to be necessary are identified in the following table.

actually have close ties with Putin, who is the promoter of this big danger, so I’d like to
know your thoughts about this and how yow’re going to deal with it.

Bannon: Could you summarize that for me?

Harnwell: The first question was, you'd reference the Front National and UKIP as having
elements that are tinged with the racial aspect amidst their voter profile, and the
questioner was asking how you intend to deal with that aspect.

Bannon: I don’t believe I said UKIP in that. I was really talking about the parties on the
continent, Front National and other European parties.

I’m not an expert in this, but it seems that they have had some aspects that may be anti-
Semitic or racial. By the way, even in the tea party, we have a broad movement like this,
and we've been criticized, and they try to make the tea party as being racist, etc., which it’s
not. But there’s always elements who turn up at these things, whether it’s militia guys or
whatever. Some that are fringe organizations. My point is that over time it all gets kind of
washed out, right? People understand what pulls them together, and the people on the
margins I think get marginalized more and more.

I believe that you'll see this in the center-right populist movement in continental Europe.
I’ve spent quite a bit of time with UKIP, and I can say to you that I’ve never seen anything
at all with UKIP that even comes close to that. I think they've done a very good job of
policing themselves to really make sure that people including the British National Front
and others were not included in the party, and I think you’ve seen that also with tea party
groups, where some people would show up and were kind of marginal members of the tea
party, and the tea party did a great job of policing themselves early on. And I think that’s
why when you hear charges of racism against the tea party, it doesn’t stick with the
American people, because they really understand.

I think when you look at any kind of revolution — and this is a revolution — you always
have some groups that are disparate. I think that will all burn away over time and you'll

see more of a mainstream center-right populist movement.

“Because at the end of the day, I think that Putin and his cronies are really a kleptocracy,
that are really an imperialist power that want to expand.”

National Intelligence justified the secret intelligence budget by saying in an open session of
Congress, “We are bolstering our support for clandestine SIGINT [signal intelligence]
capabilities to collect against high priority targets, including foreign leadership targets,” and to
develop “groundbreaking cryptanalytic capabilities to defeat adversarial cryptography and exploit
Internet traffic.” It was no secret, even before Snowden, that the NSA was engaged with
monitoring the Internet.

Through all this tumult the heart of the NSA’s activity remained its 5,000 acre base at Fort
George G. Meade, Maryland. It commanded the most powerful mechanism for intercepting
communications that the world had ever seen. No other country came close to its technology for
intercepting information. The NSA was not only able to intercept secret information from these
potential adversaries, but it also, at least not until the Snowden breach, managed to conceal these
means from them. As long as these adversaries remained blind to the ways in which its
communications were being intercepted, deciphered and read by the NSA, they could not take
effective countermeasures. Consequently, he NSA had the capability to provide the President
and his advisers with continuous insights into the thinking and planning of potential enemies.

Keeping its sources and methods secrets was no easy task. The NSA’s technicians had to deal
with continuous technical challenges to provide a seamless harvesting of data from a wide range
of communication devices, including telephones, computers and the Internet. It required
continuous intra-agency communications between the NSA’s own intelligence officers and a
growing number of civilian technicians. It even had its own “Wiki-style” network through which
they could discuss problems, called the NSANet. As it could not tightly control access to this
technical network, it expunged any mention of the sources and methods from the material
circulated on the classified NSA network. Instead, it stored them in discrete computers, called
compartments that were disconnected from other computers at the NSA. These compartments
could only be accessed by a limited number of analysts and NSA executives who had a need to
know about the data they contained. These compartments were the final line of defense against
an inside intruder.

In 2009, Snowden found his way into the NSA through a temporary job with an outside
contractor that had a contract with the NSA’s Technology Directorate to repair and update it
back-up system. Four years later, by maneuvering to get hired by another outside contractor with
access to the NSA’s sources and methods, he was able to steal secrets stored in isolated
computers bearing directly on the ongoing intelligence war. Snowden also copied from these
compartments in a matter of weeks, as has been previously mentioned, the NSA’s Level 3 sources
and methods used against Russia, Iran and China. The Snowden breach demonstrated that the
NSA’s envelope of secrecy was at best illusory.

After this immense loss, the NSA’s sources inside these adversary countries were largely
compromised even if they were not closed down. Once these adversaries were in a position to
know what channels the NSA was intercepting, they could use these same channels to mislead US

The FBI case revealed sexual allegations by at least 20 girls, however, Epstein struck a deal with
prosecutors and served 13 months' jail for soliciting child prostitution.

Ms Roberts stayed working as Epstein's masseuse until she met an Australian martial arts
expert named Robert.

The pair married, causing an enraged Epstein to cut off the then 19-year-old.

Ms Roberts said she was coming to grips with her exploitation. Three years ago she was
contacted by the FBI who found photos and secret videos of her during their investigations.

The case forced Ms Roberts to deal with her abuse and also reveal it to her husband.

I couldn't bring myself to tell him much. No man wants to know his wife has been traded out,”
she told The Mail.

While Epstein's plea deal meant her identity was hidden, Ms Roberts said after seeing a picture
of the pair shopping she had to go public. I am appalled. To me, it's saying 'We are above the
law'. But Jeffrey is a monster. Both Epstein and Prince Andrew refused to comment.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012820.txt,"When this happens, our promiscuous brain has worked its combinatorial magic, causing us to feel good
when we witness someone else’s misfortune.

Schadenfreude, like envy, causes us to self-evaluate, looking inside of ourselves to assess our net
worth relative to others. We know from a large body of studies, several carried out by the American
social psychologist Roy Baumeister, that when an individual’s sense of self-worth is threatened,
especially those individuals with more narcissistic and overly confident personalities, aggression often
follows. The more personally threatened we feel, the more pleasure we should feel when someone else
suffers. The Dutch psychologist Wilco van Dijk tested this idea with two simple experiments. In both
experiments, subjects filled out a questionnaire that they believed evaluated their intellectual strengths.
Upon completion and scoring of the questionnaire, some were told that they had utterly flopped, scoring
in the lowest 10% of all subjects, while others were told that they performed brilliantly, scoring in the
upper 10%. Next, all subjects read a scenario in which someone suffers a misfortune. For example, in one
scenario, a student rents an expensive car to show off at a party, but then drives the car into a river, not
only damaging the car but requiring the fire department to tow it out. Those whose sense of self-worth
was threatened by the abominable test score were more likely to say that they felt good about the
misfortune, including smirks and laughter in response to the show off who submerged his rented car.
These results powerfully show that schadenfreude serves the beneficial function of hoisting our own self-
worth. When our self-worth has been challenged, for whatever reason, we feel better knowing that
someone else is worse off, regardless of context or direct relevance.

Our desire to see others suffer so that we may feel better can escalate to absurd levels, especially
when it is fueled by ideology. Beliefs can blind us to the cost-benefit analysis, motivating us to see harm
done to those outside of our inner sanctum even if it hurts us as well. Religious and political ideologies
are two of the hotspots that can drive entirely irrational desires and absurd attributions.

The American psychologist Richard Smith explored whether an individual’s political convictions
influenced the intensity of schadenfreude when witnessing a member of another party suffer, including
cases where society at large also suffers. Smith initiated the study prior to the US Presidential elections in
2004 involving Republican George W. Bush and Democrat John Kerry; during this period, the
Republicans controlled both executive branches of the government. Each subject — all college
undergraduates — provided information about party affiliation and strength of support for the policies
and beliefs of their party. Next, every subject read and provided reactions to short newspaper articles
describing tragicomic moments for the two candidates, one in which Bush fell off his bicycle while
riding, and the other involving Kerry wearing a bizarre space outfit during a visit to NASA. Last,
subjects read and reacted to an article describing job losses and the economic downturn facing the nation

— an article meant to capture an objective cost to all members of society, irrespective of party affiliation.

"
IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027860.txt,"need remains what I tried to impress on my negotiators then: realism. A
meticulously informed, utterly unvarnished, understanding of the threats we
face, of each altered situation after every success or a failure, and an ability to
set aside the background noise and political pressures and chart a way forward.

So what is that way? It begins with the mindset. On more than one occasion
in the past few years, after Prime Minister Netanyahu had warned our country
of a nuclear Iran or the spread of Al Qaeda-style hatred and violence, as if
prophesying the coming of Armageddon, I would say to him: “Stop talking like
that. You’re not delivering a sermon in a synagogue. You’re Prime Minister.”
Having been privileged to live my own life along with the entire modern history
of our country, I went further. Zionism, the founding architecture of Israel, was
rooted in finding a way to supplant not just the life, but the way of thinking,
which hard-pressed Jewish communities had internalised over centuries in the
diaspora: in Hebrew, the galut. We would instead take control of our own
destiny, building and developing and securing our own country.

Now, I told Bibi, he was back in the mindset of the galut. Yes, al-Qaeda, and
more recently Islamic State, were real dangers. The prospect of a nuclear Iran
was even more so. “But the implication of the way you speak, not just to Barack
Obama or David Cameron, but to /sraelis, is that these are existential threats.
What do you imagine? That if, God forbid, we wake up and Iran is a nuclear
power, we’ll pack up and go back to the shtetls of Europe?”

Of course not. Israel, as my public life has taught me more than most,
remains strong militarily. We are, still, fully capable of turning back any of the
undeniable threats on our doorstep. Keeping that strength, developing it and
modernizng it, are obviously critically important. But as Israel’s founding Prime
Minister, David Ben-Gurion, used to say, the success of Zionism, and of the
Israeli state, required two things: strength and “righteousness.” He didn’t mean
the word in purely religious terms. He meant that Israel, if it were to retain
international backing and internal cohesion, must be guided by a core of moral
assumptions as well.

That, in itself, would be reason enough to pursue every possible opportunity
for “end of conflict” with our neighbours. And, at home, to protect and re-
inforce our commitment to Israel as both a Jewish and a democratic state. But
Israel’s simple self-interest — its hope for prosperity, social cohesion, and
growth in future — makes this nothing short of imperative.

as the prospect of a state got closer.

The memories remain with me to this day, like a series of snapshots. It was
on a spring morning in 1947 that I got my first real sense that the Jewish state
was something which would have be fought for, and that youngsters not all that
much older than me would have a critical role to play. I got a close-up look at
the elite of the Zionist militias, the Palmach. It numbered something like 6,000,
from a pre-state force totaling around 40,000. The Palmachniks were highly
motivated, young political activists. They had no fixed base. Each platoon,
almost all of them teenagers, spent five or six months at a time on various
kibbutzim. For the first two weeks of each month, they would earn their keep by
working in the fields. They spent the other weeks training. I had just turned five
when I watched three dozen Palmach boys and girls, in their T-shirts and short
khaki pants, rappel confidently down the side of one of our few concrete
buildings. The building was only 25 or 30 feet high, but it looked like a
skyscraper from my perch on the grass in front, and the feat of the young
Palmachniks seemed to me nothing short of heroic.

A few months later, on a Saturday afternoon in November 1947, I crowded
into my parents’ room as the Haganah radio station crackled out its account of a
United Nations debate on the future of Palestine. The session was the outcome
of a long train of events starting with Britain’s acknowledgement that its
mandate to rule over Palestine was unsustainable. The British had proposed a
series of arrangements to accommodate both Arab and Jewish aspirations. Now,
the UN was meeting to consider the idea of splitting Palestine into two new
states, one Arab and the other Jewish.

Since the partition was based on existing areas of Arab and Jewish
settlement, the proposed Jewish state looked like a boomerang, with a long,
very narrow center strip along the Mediterranean, broadening slightly into the
Galilee in the north and the arid coastline in the south. Jerusalem, the site of the
ancient Jewish temple, was not part of it. It was to be placed under international
rule. By no means all Zionist leaders were happy with partition. Many, on both
the political right and the left, wanted a Jewish state in all of Palestine, with
Jerusalem as its centerpiece. But Ben-Gurion and the pragmatic mainstream
argued that UN endorsement of a Jewish state — no matter what its borders, even
with a new Palestinian Arab state alongside it — would represent a historic
achievement. The proceedings went on for hours. At sundown, we had to return
to the children’s home. But we were woken before dawn. The vote for partition

The Federal Government has taken swift action to deal with the crisis, but many
observers say that these actions are not sufficient to help the UAE, and Dubai in
particular, to be free of the crisis?

The actions that we took at the Federal Government were really fast, well thought-out to respond to the issues
and to overcome the negative effects of the global crisis. Having said that, our economy has shifted from the
crisis mode to the solution. Of course, we are monitoring and following up our situation and the development of
all the economic sectors through federal and local specialized committees, just as we follow developments in
the global economy and international markets. We thank God; most of the indicators seem positive now and

call for optimism. However, should we face future developments further actions, then we won’t sit back.

that people are not aware of the life realities in the United Arab Emirates. Well, I welcome this interpretation
because it emphasizes the depth of ties among the Emirates and ensures the strength of our Central Bank and its
confidence in Dubai’s economy.

We have announced bonds totaling $20 billion, raised half of it as a public offering, then the Central Bank
subscribed to the full amount; we will pay an annual interest rate of 4 percent annually on the five-year
coupons. What we put forward, meets our needs at this stage. Should we need the second part — that is, $10

Dhabi will be its partner in many projects in place or under implementation. What is the
truth in this?

These rumors and speculations turned into news and headlines in several prominent international newspapers.

Abu Dhabi and Dubai and the rest of the UAE, and all that is in Abu Dhabi belongs to Dubai and Abu Dhabi,

and they want to keep the land.”

Other analysts, while conceding any progress would be slow, had
somewhat more positive forecasts on the Syrian front.

[Syria] is a tough one to happen quickly, but at least if they start talking
then it’s a good thing,” said Andrew Hammond, policy fellow at the
European Council on Foreign Relations and author of The Islamic Utopia:
The Illusion of Reform in Saudi Arabia.

“Fundamentally, the chances of the Syrian tragedy being brought to an
end, or the beginning of this disaster being brought to an end, require these
two countries to come to an agreement [...] They are the keys to the
Syrian conflict, so they have to start talking, even though it will take a
long time.”

Accordingly, with little chance of the two reaching agreement on Syria in

the immediate future, the talks may in fact focus on other areas of dispute,
such as Iraq, where a new coalition government is being formed following
parliamentary elections on 30 April.

“The other issue is Iraq, now that the election is over and all the horse-
trading is beginning,” said Hammond. “I wonder whether that actually
may have been the main impetus for this invitation.”

Perhaps the most significant changes resulting from Faisal’s initiative in
the long run, however, will pertain to Saudi itself. Having been “shocked,”
as Hammond put it, by the United States’ decision to pursue warmer ties
with Tehran last year, and initially threatening a “major shift” in its
relations with Washington as a consequence, Riyadh may now be
grudgingly coming to terms with the new order envisaged by President
Obama.

“It does suggest there is a potential for them to reassess the situation and
try and move things forward, find some way of having a new relationship
with the Iranians, given the fact that the Americans clearly want to move
forward, and the smaller Gulf states do as well,” said Hammond.

Turki explains the Saudis’ practice of shar-
ing information regarding Osama bin Lad-

Princes also distinguish the instant case
from Bowm and other cases cited by the
Plaintiffs on the basis that groups that
they are alleged to have supported were
not designated as terrorist organizations
by the United States government. See
Bown I, 291 F.3d at 1002 (noting Hamas
was designated a terrorist organization by
President Clinton in 1995 and by the Sec-
retary of State in 1997); see also Consoli-
dated Plaintiffs’ Opp. to Prince Sultan’s

Although they did not involve New York
law, the Court agrees that Halberstam
and Boim are instructive. In Halberstam,
the defendant enjoyed an extravagant life-
style made entirely possible by her long-
term live-in boyfriend’s regular burglaries.

349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES

The court concluded that she had to know
of his criminal activities because she acted
as a money launderer for her boyfriend’s
stolen metals business. Halberstam, 705
F.2d at 486-88. The court found the de-
fendant was so close to the illegal activity
that she had to be aware of her role in it.
Id. at 486. In Boim, the court denied the
defendants’ motion to dismiss because the
complaint contained specific factual allega-
tions tying the defendants to Hamas. For
example, one defendant entity allegedly
employed an individual designated as a
terrorist affiliated with Hamas, another
entity admitted providing funds to Hamas,
two individual defendants had documented
and admitted ties to Hamas, and numer-
ous links existed between the individual
terrorist defendants and the entity defen-
dants. Bown [, 127 F.Supp.2d at 1006-
1008. Unlike Hamas in Bowm, none of the
organizations the Princes are alleged to
have supported in an official capacity were
designated a sponsor of terrorism at the
time of the alleged contributions. In fact,
only BIF and certain branches of Al Hara-
main have since been designated. See
Exec. Order No. 18224 (designating BIF
(November 19, 2002) and branches of Al
Haramain (Bosnia, Somalia on March 11,
2002; Indonesia, Kenya, Pakistan, Tanza-
nia on January 22, 2004; Afghanistan, Al-
bania, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, the Nether-

to Boim, the Plaintiffs would have to al-
lege specific facts showing that the
Princes knew or should have known that
the charities they supported were actually
fronts for al Qaeda. See Burnett I, 274
F.Supp.2d at 106.

debts, we’re on a collision course with the future. The good news: Although time is
growing short, we still have the capacity to create positive outcomes.

Even though USA Inc. can print money and raise taxes, USA Inc. cannot sustain its financial
imbalance indefinitely — especially as the Baby Boomer generation nears retirement age. Net
debt levels are approaching warning levels, and some polls suggest that Americans consider
reducing debt a national priority. Change is legally possible. Unlike underfunded pension
liabilities that can bankrupt companies, USA Inc.’s underfunded liabilities are not legal contracts.
Congress has the authority to change the level and conditions for Social Security and Medicare
benefits; the federal government, together with the states, can also alter eligibility and benefit
levels for Medicaid.

Options for entitlement reform, operating efficiency, and stronger long-term GDP growth.

As analysts, not public policy experts, we can offer mathematical illustrations as a framework for
discussion (not necessarily as actual solutions). We also present policy options from third-party
organizations such as the CBO.

Reforming entitlement programs — Social Security.

The underfunding could be addressed through some or all of the following mechanical changes:
increasing the full retirement age to as high as 73 (from the current level of 67); and/or reducing
average annual social security benefits by up to 12% (from $13,010 to $11,489); and/or
increasing the social security tax rate from 12.4% to 14.2%. Options proposed by the CBO
include similar measures, as well as adjustments to initial benefits and index levels. Of course,
the low personal savings rates of average Americans — 3% of disposable income, compared with
a 10% average from 1965 to 1985 — limit flexibility, at least in the early years of any reform.

Reforming entitlement programs — Medicare and Medicaid.

Mathematical illustrations for these programs, the most underfunded, seem draconian: Reducing
average Medicare benefits by 53%, to $5,588 per year, or increasing the Medicare tax rate by
3.9 percentage points, to 6.8%, or some combination of these changes would address the
underfunding of Medicare. As for Medicaid, the lack of a dedicated funding stream (i.e., a tax
similar to the Medicare payroll tax) makes the math even more difficult. But by one measure
from the Kaiser Family Foundation, 60% of the Medicaid budget in 2001 was spent on so-called
optional recipients (such as mid- to low-income population above poverty level) or on optional
services (such as dental services and prescription drug benefits). Reducing or controlling these
benefits could help control Medicaid spending — but increase the burden on some poor and
disabled groups.

Ultimately, the primary issue facing the US healthcare system is ever-rising costs, historically
driven by increases in price and utilization. Beneath sustained medical cost inflation is an
entitlement mentality bolted onto a volume-based reimbursement scheme. All else being equal,
the outcome is an incentive to spend: Underlying societal, financial, and liability factors combine
to fuel an inefficient, expensive healthcare system.

“| had people in the community in Palm Beach who either made
comments directly to me or to others who relayed them to me that I
didn't need to take the tack in the investigation that we did, which is
[to] completely investigate it and then refer it tothe FBI after the
state case was resolved,” Reiter said in the deposition. “I had one
individual who came to see me a couple of times about this.”

According to the chief, the individual in question was a
prominent Palm Beach politician.

“He said this wasn’t necessary; this was a case that was really
very minor,” Reiter recalled. “The victims had lifestyles that

eventually constitute a crime. We talked several times. Early on
it didn't end favorably. You know, this is an individual [whom] I
had to interact with in my official capacity and in his official

The Palm Beach politician wasn't the only one to pressure

e All American institutions—governmental and nongovernmental—that deal with
Chinese actors (and other potential sources of inappropriate foreign influence) should
review their oversight and governance practices and codify and exemplify best
standards of practice and due diligence.

Reciprocity

American institutions are deflected from their purpose of increasing US-China
understanding, and become distorted as one-way channels of Chinese influence, when they
are denied access to China on a basis that is reciprocal with the access Chinese institutions
are granted here.

e The asymmetry of scholarly research access is the most glaring example of the lack of
reciprocity. A whole variety of normal scholarly activities—including access to archives
and certain libraries, fieldwork, conducting surveys, and interviewing officials or
average citizens—have been cut off for American researchers in China while Chinese
enjoy all of these academic opportunities in the United States. Individually and
collectively, universities and other sectors of American democratic life should insist on
greater reciprocity of access.

e US government public diplomacy activities are heavily circumscribed in China,
while nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have encountered an increasingly
difficult environment to carry out their work. More reasonable reciprocity for US
public diplomacy efforts in China, relative to China’s activities in the United States,
should be addressed in negotiations between the two countries. In addition, this
report recommends enhanced American efforts to promote independent news and
information, and democratic ideas, through US global broadcasting and efforts to
counter disinformation.

e The US government should actively promote and protect opportunities for American
actors to operate in China.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012834.txt,"Chimpanzees also suffer, experiencing pain from both physical attacks and social loss. But getting angry
at something or someone and feeling pain from a physical or social assault are different from getting
angry because someone’s behavior was morally wrong, and suffering from a morally toxic action. I get
angry at my computer all the time, swearing when it crashes, and even smacking it on its backside. But
there is no moral harm. In this sense, there is no evidence that chimpanzees have a sense of right and
wrong, and that the pain they experience is linked to a sense of how one ought to behave. Chimpanzees
can’t be evildoers, but they certainly can, and have been evilrecipients.

There is also an important difference between violently harming another and knowing it is wrong,
and harming another because it is wrong. The latter fits at least one view of evil, a kind of radical evil in
which harm is created for harm’s sake, because it is rewarding. When Willie Bosket killed those two men,
he was certainly old enough to know the difference between right and wrong. He most likely killed
knowingly, perhaps for the generic experience of shooting someone, but perhaps not with a desire to harm
for harm’s sake. Then again, when he noted that he killed for the experience, perhaps this was the
experience of pleasure from harming another.

Was Willie Bosket responsible for his shootings? The answer to this question depends on how
we think about Bosket’s options, and the link between cause and effect. At the simplest level, Bosket
caused the death of the two men in the same way that a swinging wrecking ball can cause the death of two
men. But the wrecking ball can’t be held accountable or responsible in the same way that Bosket can.
Wrecking balls lack options and lack the capacity to predict the consequences of their actions. Bosket
had options, could foresee the consequences of his actions, and had the capacity to act upon his options.
Or did he?

We know that the frontal lobes of the brain play an important role in self-control and emotional
regulation. We also know that this area of the brain is not fully mature until people reach their mid-
twenties. Bosket was, therefore, operating with an immature brain. His actions were, in some ways, like
the wrecking ball, driven by inertia. Perhaps the frustration of failing to achieve his goal — robbery —
caused a dizzying chemical reaction in his brain, causing a flood of emotions, blinding his capacity to
think rationally. Paraphrasing the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek, these electrochemical storms in
Bosket’s brain caused him to deposit his conscience at the door. Like the husband who finds his wife in
bed with her lover and kills them both on the spot, Bosket committed a crime of passion. On this account,
not only is he not evil, he is pardonable.

Immaturity is a mitigating factor when we evaluate a crime. It is why, in many countries, there is
one legal system for youths and another for adults. It is why, in countries with the death penalty, such as
the United States, youths are immune. With maturity comes a heightened capacity to control ones

actions, or at least, to gain better self-control and thus, to take responsibility for what one does. This

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021298.txt,"and physiological features of a heart
attack, including chest pain,
abnormalities on the electrocardiogram,
and elevated cardiac enzymes (reflecting
damaged heart muscle) (2). The
condition has variously been termed
takotsubo cardiomyopathy, left-
ventricular apical ballooning,
myocardial stunning, stress
cardiomyopathy, or in the more
vernacular parlance of the New York
Times, broken heart syndrome
(prompted by a medical review that was
published just before Valentine’s Day).
In general accord with the speculation of
Cannon, broken heart syndrome appears
to be triggered by an exaggerated
autonomic nervous system response,
characterized by sympathetic activation
and high levels of the stress hormone
epinephrine (adrenalin) (3). It is
important to note in these cases that
psychological states, as mild as they may
be, are able to induce a clear and
demonstrable organ pathology.

Physiological abnormalities or
dysfunctions underlie medical
conditions, and indeed, constitute the
defining features of disease states. An
important question, however, is how
those dysfunctions come to be. There are
many ways in which disease develops —
traumatic injuries, biotic infections,
degenerative conditions — and the list
goes on. The fields of psychophysiology,
psychosomatic or behavioral medicine,
and health psychology are particularly
concerned with how psychological and
behavioral factors impact physiological
systems and thus health. Of particular
interest are those psychological
dimensions that uniquely impact

physiology.
An example comes from the

study of Herpes Simplex viral infections.
Herpes Simplex viruses are responsible

Page |52

for cold sores (HSV type I) and genital
herpes (HSV type IT). Once contracted,
herpes virus infections generally remain
for life, although they are characterized
by periodic eruptions and remissions.
During the latter, the immune system
effectively dampens viral activity and
the virus retreat to a more or less
dormant state. Although multiple factors
likely contribute to the reactivation of
HSV, one trigger appears to be stress—
the defacing cold sore that erupts, for
example, just before the prom or an
important date. Ohio State researchers
sought an animal model of this
reactivation, so the underlying links and
mediators could be studied. Try as they
might, however, the research group was
unable to reactivate HSV infections in
mice with standard laboratory stressors,
such as restraint-stress or shock. In a
collaborative effort, we pointed out that
the stressors that lead to HSV
reactivation in humans were often of a
social nature. Indeed, for both humans
and mice, social relations are central to
happiness, adaptation and even survival.
In light of this, a social stressor was
introduced into the project (changing the
housing groupings and thus disrupting
established social relations). The social
stress, but again not physical stressors,
resulted in significant HSV reactivation
(4). Psychological factors, and in this
case a specific social psychological
variable, uniquely impacted an important
aspect of viral immunity. This early
finding led to a series of studies that
have elucidated physiological pathways
that mediate the relationship between
social stress, immune function and HSV
reactivation. But, what is it that makes
social stress unique and distinct from
physical stressors?

We have identified a probable
general contributor to the differences

that the public will still have free access to the island’s
shoreline, which includes Christmas Cove, a popular boating
site and home to floating restaurant Pizza Pi.

A wealthy financier long associated with the rich and
powerful, including former President Bill Clinton and
President Donald Trump, Epstein, 66, was convicted in 2008
of procuring a child under the age of 18 for prostitution.

An investigation by the Miami Herald found that despite
evidence Epstein sexually abused dozens of underage girls,
some who say they were forced to have sex with Epstein’s
rich friends at his various homes, including on Little St.
James, federal prosecutor Alexander Acosta — who now
serves as U.S. secretary of labor — worked with Epstein’s
defense attorneys to craft an extraordinarily lenient plea
deal.

A federal judge ruled in February that Miami prosecutors
violated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act when they
intentionally kept that agreement secret from victims in the

case.

While Epstein owns lavish properties in New York City, Palm
Beach, and New Mexico that he travels between on his private
Boeing 727, he lists Little St. James as his primary residence
on his sex offender registration.

Epstein last verified his registration with the V.I. Justice
Department on March 15, which lists the 11 vehicles he owns
— all of which are black — including a Mercedes-Benz S550,
Bentley Arnage, Hurnmer II, Dodge Caravan, Range Rover,
three Chevy Suburbans and three Cadillac Escalades.

espionage work for another 8 years. (Whitworth, who was arrested by the FBI in 1985, was
convicted of espionage and sentenced to 365 years in prison.)

The Internet provided an almost ideal environment for false flags since its users commonly
adopt aliases, screen names, and other avatars. The threat officer explained how easy it would be
for the KGB to adapt such a false flag when dealing with a dissident system administrator
working for US intelligence. As the threat officer pointed out in his report, the KGB had used
false flags in the late 1980s to surreptitiously recruit members of the “German Hanover Hackers,”
a community of anarchistic hackers who breached computer networks for fun and profit. Up
until then, these hacktavists stole corporate and private passwords, credit card information, and
other privileged documents as a form of freelance espionage. Because of their fervent anti-
authority ideology, the KGB disguised its recruiters as fellow hacktavists. The KGB succeeded in
getting the Hanover hackers to steal log-in account identifications, source codes and other
information from U.S. government computer networks.

The precise vulnerability that this threat officer pointed out in 1996 was system administrators.

This weak link became increasingly relevant as the NSA moved further into the digital age. By the
beginning of the 21* century, its growing networks of computers were largely run by civilian
technicians, including system administrators, infrastructure analysts, and information
technologists, who were need to keep the system running. Despite the warning by the threat
officer, the NSA became more reliant on these outsiders as it reorganized to meet its new
mandates for surveillance of the Internet in the war on terrorism. Since the NSA had to compete
with technology companies, such as Google, Apple and Facebook, for the services of experienced
IT workers, it used private contractors to find them. They, in turn, recruited civilian technicians
from many unconventional areas, including the hacking culture. Ex-hackers, who lacked (or
shunned) employment opportunities in the corporate sector, were suitable candidates for the
system administrator jobs that these films had contracted to supply the NSA. In the rush to
expand, little heed was paid to the 1996 warning that this hacking culture might provide a portal
to anti-government hacktavist groups. The NSA became so enamored with this new technology
that it neglected the security implications of employing outsiders, “All of us just fell in love with
the ease and convenience and scale [of electronic storage]”, Michael Hayden, who headed the
NSA at the time, said to the Wall Street Journal in 2015. “So we decided to take things we used
to keep if not in a safe, at least in our desk drawer, and put it up here [in a computer network],
where it’s by definition more vulnerable.” | Making matters even worse, as has been previously
discussed, the NSA stripped away much of the so-called stove-piping that insulated highly-
sensitive data from the NSA’s other computer networks. Here they were merely following the
recommendations of the 9/11 Commission to make their data more accessible to other agencies
concerned with potential terrorist attacks. As a result, the inner sanctum of the NSA became
more opened to its new army of civilian technicians.

The universe of independent contractors was governed by very different forces than that of
intelligence services. By 2013, much of the job of managing the NSA’s classified computers had
been handed over to five private companies: Booz Allen Hamilton, which handled the most highly
secret work; and Dell SecureWorks, Microsoft, Raytheon, and IBM. In many respects, these five

resulted in an international incident but did not change the fact that
Snowden was still in the custody of Russian authorities.

Snowden came to realize that those assisting him, including
Assange and Harrison, were taking serious risks. “Anyone ina three-
mile radius [of me] is going to get hammered,” he later said in 2015
to a reporter from Vogue. (After finally leaving Snowden in Moscow
on November 3, 2013, Harrison moved to Berlin, where she set up
an organization to provide, as she termed it, “an underground rail-
road” for other fugitives who had made available documents expos-
ing government secrets.)

Snowden was sequestered in the transit zone of the Moscow air-
port for thirty-seven days. A Russian intermediary provided him
with a Russian classic to read while awaiting asylum. It was Fyodor
Dostoyevsky’s Crime and Punishment, whose protagonist, Rodion
Romanovich Raskolnikov, is a dissenter who believes breaking the
law is morally justified by the unfair abuses of the political system.

Snowden received official sanctuary in Russia on August 1, 2013.
His public statements in Hong Kong that he was willing to go to

© prison so that others could live freely in a democratic society were, ©
as it turned out, mere rhetoric. Instead of risking prison, he had suc-
cessfully escaped to a country in which he would be treated as a hero
for defying the U.S. government. He had not sacrificed himself; he
had transformed himself. He had risen from being a lowly techni-
cian in Hawaii whose talents went largely unrecognized to the status
of an international media star in Moscow. In his new role, he could
make Internet appearances via Skype to prestigious gatherings, such
as the TED conference, where he would be roundly applauded as an
Internet hero, as well as be paid a $20,000 fee for just his electronic
participation. He would be beamed into dozens of ACLU meetings
where he was celebrated as a defender of American liberty. He would
describe to sympathetic audiences in Germany, Norway, and France
the unfairness of the American legal system, asserting that it was
denying him a “fair trial.” He would now make front-page news
by granting interviews to The New York Times, The Washington
Post, The Nation, and other publications. He would join Poitras and
Greenwald on the board of directors of the Freedom of the Press
Foundation. He would be the subject of an Oscar-winning documen-

Prince Andrew denies sex abuse claims - CNN.com

oa edition.cnn.com

Story highlights

e Prince Andrew addresses crowd at Davos, backs palace statement
e Court documents show attorneys sent a letter asking to interview him under oath
e Buckingham Palace has strenuously denied claim that he had sex with Virginia Roberts
Firstly, | think | must, want, for the record to refer to the events that have taken place in the last three weeks. And |

just wish to reiterate and to reaffirm the statements which have already been made on my behalf by Buckingham
Palace,” he said Thursday at the World Economic Forum.

Earlier this month, Buckingham Palace issued a statement which said, It is emphatically denied that the Duke of
York [Andrew] had any form of sexual contact or relationship with the woman. Any claim to the contrary is false and
without foundation.

Andrew is a son of Queen Elizabeth II and a brother of Prince Charles, the next in line for the British throne.

The prince is accused of having sex with the woman when she was 17, details of which are is a sworn affidavit in
Florida court dated January 19. The woman said that she and the Prince had sex three times, including one orgy.

The court documents showed that her lawyers had sent a letter to Buckingham Palace asking to interview the prince
under oath.

In her sworn affidavit, the woman described Buckingham Palace's denial that sexual contact ever took place
between the pair as false and hurtful to me.

Interview request

The woman, identified by Buckingham Palace as Virginia Roberts, first named the prince in a civil motion filed
December 30 in the U.S. District Court in southern Florida in which she claims she was forced to have sex with
several men. She is referred to as Jane Doe No. 3 in the legal filings.

In the letter the woman's lawyers sent to Buckingham Palace, attorneys Paul Cassell and Bradley Edwards asked to
interview Prince Andrew under oath regarding interactions that you had with Jane Doe No. 3 beginning in
approximately early 2001. Jane Doe No. 3 was then 17 years old.

The letter includes a picture of the woman and Andrew which was taken around that time, they say. The lawyers also
want to discuss subsequent interactions with their client in New York City later that year, the letter says.

The interview could be conducted at a time and place of your choosing, and with your cooperation, | believe the
interview could be completed in two hours or less, it says.

New court pleadings involving the relationship between Jane Doe No. 3 and the prince are being prepared, the letter
adds, but their filing will be delayed if Andrew accepts the interview request by January 19.

The attorney for her legal team confirmed to CNN that Buckingham Palace had refused to accept the letter to Prince
Andrew and that it was returned to them.

Buckingham Palace didn't respond Thursday when asked by CNN about the letter.

science can tell something about how this process works. You can’t
find an experience that was indexed wrong, for example.

Good indexing involves figuring out the goal that an experience
relates to and the conditions that allowed that goal to be achieved
or not. We do not do this consciously. We learn by doing, that is, we
learn from experience, and from thinking about those experiences.
When we have understood our experiences well enough, we can (un-
consciously) index them so that they will come up again just in time
when we need them again. (This is what we call being reminded.) It
is beyond the scope of this book to explain how that process works.?
The simple idea is that experiences get labeled when we think about
them and not otherwise.

So the real question for an integrity and compliance officer is how
to get people to think about integrity and compliance issues. This
thinking needs be done over time in a complex way and voluntarily.
How might we do that?

That is the real question.

One answer to this is stories. People really like stories. As long as
there have been people, there have been stories; we have moved from
epic poems and theatre to novels and movies in recent years, but, by
and large, the stories are the same. How to overcome obstacles to get-
ting what you want, is a theme that dominates much of literature,
for example. Movie makers say it as “boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy
loses girl, boy gets girl.” There have been many books written about
the basic plots that occur again and again in stories.

Human beings understand stories because stories resonate with
them. Characters have dilemmas that readers or viewers themselves
have had. Stories appeal to emotions rather than logic, and emo-
tions are at the heart of our pre-7-year-old unconscious selves. We feel
something because of a well-told story and that feeling can help us see
something in a new way.

Why am I going on and on about stories? I believe that all of
human intercourse is about the exchange of stories. (I wrote a book
about this.*) If you want to appeal to the pre-7-year-old unconscious
that resides in all of us, you need to hit emotion not logic. This means
that a good story can help someone to reconsider deep down in their
unconscious a feeling or attitude or seemingly immutable personality
trait that they can feel perhaps is somewhat dysfunctional. Stories can
change our natural instincts.

2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *945

In light of the statutory statement in /8 U.S.C. § 377/(d)(6) that nothing in the CVRA shall be construed to impair the
prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General, as well as the separation of powers issues raised by judicial review of the

government's decision to terminate a prosecution, the Subcommittee was not persuaded that the rule should be amended to
require the court to consider the victim's views on dismissal. When there is no public court proceeding, the victim's views will
be taken into account through the right to confer with the government under /8 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(5). 47!

The Advisory Committee's opening premise is clear enough - victims do indeed have great interest in whether charges are
dismissed. But after this promising start, the Committee's logic is hard to track. The Advisory Committee seems to be of the
view that, in situations where a court considers a motion to dismiss at a public proceeding, the victim would be heard. *7* Yet
the proposed Rule the Committee cites for this proposition - proposed Rule 60 +73 - is actually drafted so narrowly that the
victim would have no right to be heard on such a motion. 474

In situations where the court considered a motion to dismiss without a public proceeding, the Advisory Committee takes the
view that the CVRA does not explicitly address the subject. This view assumes, of course, that the victim's right to fairness
does not come into play when the prosecution moves to drop previously filed charges. This assumption is incorrect. Rule 48
already requires leave of court for a dismissal. In determining whether to grant leave, current case law requires the court to
consider whether dismissal is clearly contrary to manifest public interest. +7> The existing caselaw requires that the impact
on a victim be considered in addressing a motion to dismiss. A dismissal is clearly contrary to the public interest if the
prosecutor appears to be motivated by animus toward the victim. 47° Under the command of the CVRA, the victim thus must
be treated with fairness when the dismissal motion is addressed, as my proposal provides.

[*946] When the government files a motion to dismiss criminal charges involving a specific victim, the only way to protect
that victim's right to be treated fairly is to consider the victim's views on the dismissal. +77 To treat a person with fairness is
conventionally understood as treating them justly and equitably.. 478 A victim is not treated justly and equitably if her
views are never before the court.

The Advisory Committee also alludes vaguely to separation of powers issues raised by judicial review of the government's
decision to terminate a prosecution. Here the Advisory Committee may be stepping out of line and questioning the Supreme
Court. In 1944, the Court itself added the requirement to Rule 48 that prosecutors obtain leave of court before dismissing any
indictment. *7? Thus, if there are separation of powers issues about judicial review of dismissals, they have existed for more
than half a century by virtue of specific Supreme Court action.

Universities will not change until some equally prestigious online
university is developed that challenges their ability to attract students.
As long as students show up at Yale, and there is no danger there in the
foreseeable future, Yale does not have to change.

But Yale must understand what it is doing to the high school sys-
tem. It has to stop telling the high schools what to teach. It has to stop
talking about how high schools must prepare students for college.
That should not be its job. Yale has to accept the idea that students
will arrive at Yale “unprepared” for college. Making Yale’s admissions
process easier should not be the job of the high schools. Teaching the
subjects that superstars don’t want to teach should not be the job of
the high schools. High schools need to focus on the concerns and is-
sues of real students living in the real world. If Yale really believes in
algebra for its students, then it can teach algebra to all entering fresh-
men. (Believe me, it never will.)

Until subjects cease to be the basis of the structure of universities,
there will be a big problem in education across the planet because ev-
eryone everywhere assumes that university degrees are important. As
long as we assume this, and as long as we accept that what is taught
in high school will be determined by the universities, we are in serious
trouble. High schools have become college preparation centers and
thus no one learns anything but academic subjects in high school.

Cognitive processes must be the meat of high schools and should
be the basis of college as well. The top-tier colleges will not change and
maybe they shouldn’t. They can continue to be research universities
and specialize in producing the next generation of Nobel physicists or
literary scholars. Great scientists are nice and I am all for producing
them. But the 3,000 colleges in the United States are not all producing
great physicists. Still they teach chemistry and require mathematics
for no reason that anyone can remember.

If we don’t start thinking seriously about how to teach thinking,
as opposed to academic subjects, to the 99% of students who have no
intention of becoming scholars, we will all lose.

on how the United States should deal with the problem. Although most members of
Congress accepted the Ford administration’s cautious approach to China as wise, many were
circumspect about the merits of China’s political, economic, social, and value systems, then
experiencing the last turmoil of the Cultural Revolution and the decline and death of Mao
Zedong in 1976,

These congressional visits to China seemed to help the Chinese government improve its
standing with Congress and favorably influence American public opinion. The resulting
reports show how granting these delegations access to China’s leaders and elements of
Chinese society that Beijing wished to highlight proved an effective strategy of calming
tensions. And the costs for Beijing were limited to modest in-country expenses, since
the members usually traveled as official congressional delegations on US government
aircraft.

One notable feature of this historical episode was the remarkable role played by Senate
Majority Leader Mike Mansfield (D-MT). Senator Mansfield was widely consulted in
Washington as an Asian affairs expert, meaning his observations arguably had more
influence than those of other members. He visited China three times during this period,
publishing separate reports with detailed assessments of various issues of concern to
Americans at the time. In the main, his reports conveyed information and opinions that
conformed with Chinese interests. Unlike many other members favoring a more cautious
pace of normalization with China and sustained ties with Taiwan, Senator Mansfield urged
the United States to promptly end ties with Taiwan and accept Beijing’s conditions for
normal diplomatic relations, warning that to do otherwise would lead to dangerous friction
in Sino-American relations and instability in Asia. Senator Mansfield portrayed China as a
power with fundamentally peaceful motives in international affairs and placed much of the
blame on the United States for past Sino-American conflicts in Asia. He also contradicted
those members who worried that China’s leadership change could lead to internal struggles
affecting China’s international and domestic policies. He insisted that such skepticism was
unwarranted, because what he called the Maoist system had been effectively inculcated
among the Chinese people. Some members complained that the limited itinerary for
congressional visits that was furnished by Chinese hosts did not provide a basis for any
meaningful assessment of conditions there. Despite the fact that many congressional
visitors questioned how durable China’s Maoist regime was and how lasting China’s
cooperation with the United States would actually prove to be, Mansfield countered that

he had had enough opportunity during his three visits to the PRC to move about and
obtain enough information through on-the-spot observation and talks with PRC leaders

to conclude that it was no passing phenomenon. So, while many members thought the
PRC’s system of indoctrination and control to be repressive politically, economically, and
socially—an affront to the human rights and dignity of its people—voices like Mansfield’s
served to mute the criticism, maintaining that the country’s political, economic, and social
system was uniquely well suited to the Chinese people.

Strangely, the media have suddenly taken an intense interest in the case of pedophile and 
major Democratic donor Jeffrey Epstein. 
In 2005, the Palm Beach police were told by the mother of a young girl in West Palm Beach 
that her daughter had been brought to the Democratic donor's mansion and asked to have 
sex with him for money. This kicked off an intensive, one-year undercover investigation. 
The police sifted through Epstein's garbage and interviewed 17 witnesses, including the 
housemen, who told of sex toys and dildos left behind after the underage girls left. One of

said they'd been paid $200 to $300 to engage in various sex acts with ...

of gunfire from the other building.

A Land Rover was approaching from the gendarmerie at the bottom of the
road. We waited until it was about 50 feet away. Amiram and I opened fire, then
Dov and Shmuel Katz as well. The driver lost control and crashed into the side
of the Renault. There were at least four policemen inside. They, too, rolled
behind the wall on the far side of the street. Using the terrace columns for cover,
we kept shooting. Within a minute or so, only a couple of the cops fired back.

Though the three Palestinians could not know the reason for the gunfire and
the wailing of the car horn, they were now on their guard. When Mookie had
blown open the door to Abu Youssef’s flat — and he, Yoni and the other two
members of his team ran into the apartment — he saw the Black September man
peering out from the bedroom. Mookie raised his Uzi but the Palestinian ducked
inside and shut the door. All four of them fired through through the door. When
they went in, they found not only Abu Youssef but his wife, both dead. When
Zvika’s team burst in on Kamal Nasser, he, too, was ready. Crouching behind a
desk, he raised an automatic pistol and fired, grazing one of the team on the leg.
But in a burst of Uzi bullets, he, too, was killed.

I suspect that Amitai’s face-to-face meeting with Dado may have saved his
life. When he and his team cornered Kamal Adwan, he had an AK-47 raised and
ready to fire. Without even a split second’s unconscious hesitation, Amitai fired
first. His only regret afterwards was that Adwan’s wife and children saw it
happen, and that when they’d blasted open the apartment door, the force blew
open the door of a nearby flat, killing an elderly Italian woman. She had been
one of the Mossad’s sources of information on the Beirut apartments.

Mookie’s team came down first. They joined us, crouching behind the
columns, as sporadic shots continued from one of the policemen behind the wall
across the street. When a second police Land Rover approached, | at first
signaled the others to let it pass. But when it suddenly accelerated toward us, we
opened fire. It swerved, crashing into the rear bumper of the other one.

The other teams were back down now. I shouted for Dov to have the drivers
bring the station wagons from around the corner. When we began to pull away,
a third police Land Rover appeared. It sped up behind us. Mookie tossed back a
grenade. The last thing I saw as we made it to the end of the block and headed
toward the seafront was the front end of the vehicle exploding. We dropped
hollow, needle-sharp spikes out the window of the car as we left, so I knew that

I. Introduction
Federal courts should treat crime victims fairly in the criminal process. In a nod to that goal, the Advisory Committee on the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (Advisory Committee) has circulated for public comment proposed amendments to the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (the Rules) regarding crime victims' rights. These amendments attempt to implement the
recently-enacted Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA), 1 which guarantees crime victims a series of rights, including the right to
be treated fairly. Unfortunately, the proposed amendments are mere tentative, half measures that do not begin to fully protect
crime victims.
This Article contends that the Advisory Committee should broaden its vision of the proper role for crime victims and
recommend far more expansive victim protections. In the CVRA, Congress articulated specific rights for crime victims, such as
the right to be notified of court hearings, to attend those hearings, and to speak at appropriate points in the process. 2 But along
with these specific rights came the sweeping requirement that crime victims be treated with fairness and with respect for the
victim's dignity and privacy. 3 This congressional command must not be ignored. In addition, entirely apart from any
congressional dictate, crime victims deserve fair treatment in the federal system. Acting for the federal judiciary, the Advisory
Committee should make certain that the Rules fully reflect victims' interests rather than allow the initiative for protecting
victims to pass to other branches of government.
This Article proceeds in five parts. Following this Introduction, Part II reviews events leading to the recently circulated
amendments. The amendments were prompted by the CVRA - an act passed by Congress in 2004 to protect victims' rights
through the federal criminal process. To comply with the CVRA, the federal criminal rules had to be amended in many places,

as I argued at length in an earlier article. 4 After receiving my suggested changes, the Advisory Committee agreed with some,
but declined to adopt many of the others. At issue for the Advisory Committee was whether to proceed narrowly by changing
only a few rules to track specific congressional directives or to proceed more broadly by reworking the entire body of federal
criminal rules to ensure that they are all fair to crime victims. The Committee opted for the narrower approach.
Part III of this Article disputes the Advisory Committee's limited vision. Congress has required that the courts must treat crime
victims with fairness throughout the process. 5 The only way to fully implement that command is a [*864] thorough
reworking of the federal criminal rules to integrate victims into the day-to-day workings of the process. The Committee's
parsimonious amendments simply ignore that congressional directive and mean that, in practice, many of the federal criminal
rules will continue to overlook the legitimate interests of crime victims.
Part IV of this Article contains a rule-by-rule analysis of changes that should be made to the federal rules. The following
changes are of particular importance:
1. Ensuring that crime victims' attorneys can appear in court (Rule 1);
2. Providing for victim participation in the plea bargain process (Rule 11);
3. Protecting victims' addresses and telephone numbers from improper disclosure (Rule 12);
4. Guaranteeing victims the right to attend criminal depositions (Rule 15);
5. Protecting victims from having personal and confidential information improperly subpoenaed (Rule 17);
6. Considering victims' interests when cases are transferred or when a bench trial is ordered (Rules 21 and 23);
7. Integrating victims into the sentencing process (Rule 32);
8. Articulating victims' right to discretionary appointment of counsel (Rule 44.1);
9. Giving victims the right to be heard at bail decisions (Rule 46);
10. Requiring victims' views be considered before a case is dismissed (Rule 48);
11. Protecting victims' right to a speedy trial (Rule 50);
12. Giving victims notice of court proceedings and of their rights in those proceedings (Rule 60(a)(1));
13. Guaranteeing victims the right to attend court proceedings (Rule 60(a)(2));
14. Guaranteeing victims the right to be heard on bail, plea, sentencing, and other issues important to victims (Rule 60(a)(3)).
Finally, Part V briefly concludes by explaining that the likely consequence of the Advisory Committee failing to fully
implement Congress's vision will be that Congress itself will step in to do the job. It would be unfortunate if the Judiciary were
to abdicate its responsibilities to protect crime victims and leave the task to another branch of government.
This Article also contains a short Afterword, which recounts developments subsequent to the drafting of this Article in January
2007.

A. The Crime Victims' Rights Movement
The Crime Victims' Rights Movement developed in the 1970s because of a perceived imbalance in the criminal justice system.
The victims' absence from criminal processes conflicted with a public sense of justice keen enough that … it has found voice
in a nationwide victims' rights' movement. 6 Victims advocates argued that the criminal justice system had become
preoccupied with defendants' rights to the exclusion of considering the legitimate interests of crime victims. 7 These advocates
urged reforms to give more attention to victims' concerns, including protecting victims' rights to be notified of court hearings,
to attend those hearings, and to be heard at appropriate points in the process.
The victims movement received considerable impetus in 1982 with the publication of the report of the President's Task Force
on Victims of Crime (Task Force). The Task Force concluded that the criminal justice system has lost an essential balance…
. The system has deprived the innocent, the honest, and the helpless of its protection… . The victims of crime have been
transformed into a group oppressively burdened by a system designed to protect them. This oppression must be reddressed. 8
The Task Force advocated multiple reforms. It recommended that prosecutors assume the responsibility for keeping victims
notified of all court proceedings and bringing to the court's attention the victim's view on such subjects as bail, plea bargains,
sentences, and restitution. 9 It also urged that courts receive victim-impact evidence at sentencing, order restitution in most
cases, and allow victims and their families to attend trials even if they would [*866] be called as witnesses. 10 In its most
sweeping recommendation, the Task Force proposed a federal constitutional amendment to protect crime victims' rights to be
present and to be heard at all critical stages of judicial proceedings. 11
In the wake of the recommendation for a constitutional amendment, crime victims' advocates considered how best to pursue
that goal. Realizing the difficulty of achieving the consensus required to amend the United States Constitution, advocates
decided to go first to the states to enact state victims' rights amendments. They have had considerable success with this statesfirst
strategy. 12 To date, about thirty states have adopted amendments to their own state constitutions, 13 which protect a
wide range of victims' rights.

The Crime Victims' Rights Movement was also able to prod the federal system to recognize victims' rights. In 1982, Congress
passed the first federal victims' rights legislation, the Victim and Witness Protection Act, which gave victims the right to make
an impact statement at sentencing and provided expanded restitution. 14 Since then, Congress has passed several acts that
further protected victims' rights, including the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, 15 the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of
1990, 16 the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 17 the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act
of 1996, 18 and the Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997. 19 Other federal statutes have been passed to deal with
specialized victim situations, such as child victims and witnesses. 20
Among these, the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 is worth briefly highlighting. This act purported to create a
comprehensive list of victim's rights in the federal criminal justice process. The act commanded that [a] crime victim has the
following rights 21 and then listed various rights in the process. Among the [*867] rights were the right to be treated with
fairness and with respect for the victims' dignity and privacy, 22 to be notified of court proceedings, 23 to confer with [the]
attorney for the Government in the case, 24 and to attend court proceedings, even if called as a witness, unless the victim's
testimony would be materially affected by hearing other testimony at trial. 25 The statute also directed the Justice
Department to make its best efforts to ensure that victims received their rights. 26 Yet this act never successfully integrated
victims into the federal criminal justice process and was generally regarded as something of a dead letter. Because Congress
passed the CVRA in 2004 to remedy the problems with this law, it is worth briefly reviewing why it was largely unsuccessful.
Curiously, the Victims' Rights Act was codified in Title 42 of the United States Code - the title dealing with Public Health and
Welfare. As a result, the statute was generally unknown to federal judges and criminal law practitioners. Federal practitioners
reflexively consult Title 18 for guidance on criminal law issues. More prosaically, federal criminal enactments are bound
together in a single West publication - the Federal Criminal Code and Rules. This single publication is carried to court by
prosecutors and defense attorneys and is on the desk of most federal judges. Because West Publishing never included the
Victims' Rights Act in this book, the statute was essentially unknown even to the most experienced judges and attorneys. The
prime illustration of the ineffectiveness of the Victims' Rights Act comes from the Oklahoma City bombing case, where victims
were denied rights protected by statute in large part because the rights were not listed in the criminal rules. 27
Because of such problems with the statutory protection of victims' rights, victims advocates decided in 1995 the time was right
to press for a federal constitutional amendment. They argued that the statutory protections could not sufficiently guarantee

victims' rights. In their view, such statutes frequently fail to provide meaningful protection whenever they come into conflict
with bureaucratic habit, traditional indifference, [or] sheer inertia. 28 As the Justice Department reported:
Efforts to secure victims' rights through means other than a constitutional amendment have proved less than fully adequate.
Victims' rights advocates have sought reforms at the state level for the past twenty years, and many states have responded with
state statutes and [*868] constitutional provisions that seek to guarantee victims' rights. However, these efforts have failed to
fully safeguard victims' rights. These significant state efforts simply are not sufficiently consistent, comprehensive, or
authoritative to safeguard victims' rights. 29
To place victims' rights in the constitution, victims advocates (led most prominently by the National Victims Constitutional
Amendment Network 30 ) approached the President and Congress about a federal amendment. 31 In April 22, 1996, Senators
Kyl and Feinstein introduced a federal victims' rights amendment with the backing of President Clinton. 32 The intent of the
amendment was to restore, preserve, and protect, as a matter of right for the victims of violent crimes, the practice of victim
participation in the administration of criminal justice that was the birthright of every American at the founding of our Nation.
33 A companion resolution was introduced in the House of Representatives. 34 The proposed amendment embodied seven core
principles: (1) the right to notice of proceedings, (2) the right to be present, (3) the right to be heard, (4) the right to notice of
the defendant's release or escape, (5) the right to restitution, (6) the right to a speedy trial, and (7) the right to reasonable
protection. In a later resolution, an eighth principle was added: standing. 35
The amendment failed to pass in the 104th Congress. On January 21, 1997, the opening day of the first session of the 105th
Congress, Senators Kyl and Feinstein reintroduced the amendment. 36 A series of hearings were held that year in both the
House and the Senate. 37 Responding to some of the concerns raised in these hearings, the amendment was reintroduced the
following year. 38 The Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings 39 and passed the proposed amendment. 40 However, the
full Senate did not consider the amendment. In 1999, Senators Kyl [*869] and Feinstein again proposed the amendment. 41
On September 30, 1999, the Judiciary Committee again voted to send the amendment to the full Senate. 42 But on April 27,

2000, after three days of floor debate, the amendment was shelved when it became clear that its opponents had the votes to
sustain a filibuster. 43 At the same time, hearings were held in the House on the companion measure there. 44
Discussions about the amendment began again after the 2000 presidential elections. On April 15, 2002, Senators Kyl and
Feinstein again introduced the amendment. 45 The following day, President Bush announced his support. 46 On May 1, 2002,
a companion measure was proposed in the House. 47 On January 7, 2003, Senators Kyl and Feinstein proposed the amendment
as Senate Joint Resolution 1. The Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings in April of that year, 48 followed by a written
report supporting the amendment. 49 On April 20, 2004, a motion to proceed to consider the amendment was filed in the
Senate. Shortly thereafter, the motion to proceed was withdrawn when proponents determined they did not have the sixty-seven
votes necessary to pass the measure. After it had become clear that the necessary super-majority votes were not available to
amend the Constitution, victims advocates turned their attention to enactment of a comprehensive victims' rights statute.
B. The Crime Victims' Rights Act
The Crime Victims' Rights Act ultimately resulted from a decision by the victims' movement to seek a more comprehensive
and enforceable federal statute rather than to pursue the dream of a federal constitutional amendment. In April 2004, victims
advocates met with Senators Kyl and Feinstein to decide whether to push again for a federal constitutional amendment.
Concluding that the amendment lacked the required supermajority, the advocates decided to press for a far-reaching federal
statute protecting victims' rights in the federal criminal justice system. 50 In exchange for backing off from the constitutional
amendment in the short term, victims advocates received near universal congressional support for a broad and encompassing
statutory victims' bill of rights. 51 This new and bolder approach not only created a bill of rights for victims, but also
provided funding for victims' [*870] legal services and created remedies when victims' rights were violated. 52 The victims'
movement would then see how this statute worked in future years before deciding whether to continue to push for a federal
amendment. 53
The legislation that ultimately passed - the Crime Victims' Rights Act - gives victims the right to participate in the system. 54
It lists various rights for crime victims in the process of prosecuting the accused, including the right to be notified of court
hearings, the right to attend those hearings, the right to be heard at appropriate points in the process, and the right to be treated
with fairness. 55 Rather than relying merely on the best efforts of prosecutors to vindicate the rights, the CVRA also contains

specific enforcement mechanisms. 56 Most important, the CVRA directly confers standing onto victims to assert their rights, a
flaw in the earlier enactment. 57 The act provides that rights can be asserted by the crime victim or the crime victim's lawful
representative, and the attorney for the Government. 58 The victim (or the government) may appeal any denial of a victim's
right through a writ of mandamus on an expedited basis. 59 The courts are also required to ensure that the crime victim is
afforded the rights given by the new law. 60 These changes were intended to make victims an independent participant in the
proceedings. 61
C. My Proposed Amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure
In the wake of the CVRA, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure needed to be significantly amended to comply with the
statute's mandates. With this goal in mind, I prepared a comprehensive set of proposed amendments to the Rules and submitted
them to the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. 62
My proposals began from the premise that victims now must be folded into the process through which federal courts conduct
criminal cases, including bail, plea, trial, and sentencing hearings. 63 Because the federal rules are the playbook [*871] of
the federal courts, it seemed advisable to reflect the new role of victims throughout the Rules. Moreover, Congress intended the
CVRA to be a formula for success and a model for our States. 64 The only way the federal rules could serve as a model, I
argued, was by fully implementing victims' rights. I then proposed twenty-eight specific changes to the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure to integrate crime victims into the federal process. 65 Each of these proposals included both specific text
for an amendment and a legal justification for the change.
D. The Criminal Rules Committee Proposals
The Advisory Committee took up my proposed rule changes in the summer of 2005. The distinguished chair of the committee,
Judge Susan Bucklew, appointed a subcommittee, chaired by Judge James Jones, to consider changes to the federal rules to
implement the CVRA. The Subcommittee, including its reporter, Professor Sara Sun Beale, prepared a report to the full
committee recommending only a few changes to the Rules. 66 The Subcommittee felt that it would not be appropriate to
create new victim rights not based upon the statute. 67 Accordingly, the Subcommittee recommended just a few changes to
the Rules, essentially parroting a few parts of the CVRA's language.

The full Advisory Committee took up the Subcommittee's proposals at its meeting on October 24-25, 2005. 68 It largely agreed
with the Subcommittee's proposals, approving a limited set of changes to the Rules to implement the CVRA. The Advisory
Committee sent a report of its proposed changes to the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure in December,
2005. 69 The Advisory Committee described its changes as seeking to incorporate, but not go beyond, the rights created by
the statute. 70 The rules were then circulated for nationwide public comment. 71 The Advisory Committee held a public
hearing on [*872] the rule change in Washington, D.C. on January 26, 2007. I testified at the hearing, presenting this Article
as my testimony. 72
III. The CVRA's Right to Fairness Requires Comprehensive Changes to Protect Victims
The CVRA requires fundamental changes in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The CVRA makes crime victims
participants in the criminal justice process and commands in sweeping terms that the courts must treat victims with fairness
and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy. 73 To faithfully implement that directive, it is necessary to assess each of
the existing rules against a fairness standard and then make changes and additions where the Rules do not guarantee fair
treatment to victims.
The Advisory Committee has made some useful progress in that direction. It should be commended for the careful drafting of
its proposed changes and the thoroughness with which it explored the topic. Moreover, it is the nature of articles such as this
one to highlight points of disagreement rather than points of agreement. The Advisory Committee has seen fit to adopt several
of the proposals that I recommended, 74 a fact that should not be overlooked.
Unfortunately, the Advisory Committee acted timidly. Instead of reviewing all the Rules to determine whether they treated
victims fairly, the Advisory Committee decided it would not venture beyond parroting specifically described rights in the
CVRA. The committee's reporter, well-regarded Duke law professor Sara Sun Beale, articulated the Advisory Committee's
drafting technique as simply incorporating rights created by Congress:
The most basic decision was how far beyond the statutory provisions the rules should go at this time. Although the CVRA
enumerates a number of specific rights, it also contains general language stating that victims have a right to be treated with
fairness. Judge Cassell advocates using this general right to fairness as a springboard for a variety of victim rights not
otherwise provided for in the CVRA.
[We] concluded that the rules should incorporate, but not go beyond, the specific statutory provisions. The CVRA reflects a
careful Congressional balance between the rights of the defendant, the discretion afforded to prosecution, and the new rights
afforded to victims. In light of this careful statutory balance, [we] felt that it would not be appropriate to create new victim
rights not based upon the statute. Rather, [we] [*873] sought to incorporate the rights Congress did afford into the rules. In so
doing, [we] attempted, to the degree possible, to use the statutory language. [We] anticipate[] that the courts will develop the

meaning of the statutory terms on a case-by-case basis, and [we] did not attempt to use the rules to anticipate and resolve the
interpretative questions that will arise. 75
Before debating the merits of the Advisory Committee's position, it is useful to step back and look at the forest rather than the
trees. Regardless of how the CVRA's language on fairness is interpreted, should we really debate treating crime victims fairly?
Presumably the general public expects the nation's criminal rules to be fair to all concerned - the government, defendants, and
victims. Reflecting that view, for the last twenty years Congress has passed a series of laws extending rights to crime victims.
76 Even without a single word in the CVRA mentioning fairness, the Advisory Committee should carefully review the existing
rules to ensure fairness for victims.
In any event, Congress has spoken. The Advisory Committee's general approach does not faithfully implement the
congressional command of fair treatment, as the following sections demonstrate.
A. The CVRA's Text and Legislative History Create a Substantive Right to Fairness
Turning to the Advisory Committee's specific justifications for not implementing the right to fairness, perhaps its most striking
claim is that the right is merely some sort of a springboard for other specific rights. The Advisory Committee declines to
implement this right because this would go beyond … the specific statutory provisions in the CVRA. 77 But the right to
fairness is itself one of the specific provisions in the CVRA. The CVRA grants victims the following rights:
1. The right to be reasonably protected from the accused
2. The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding, or any parole proceeding, involving the
crime or of any release or escape of the accused
3. The right not to be excluded from any such public court proceeding, unless the court, after receiving clear and convincing
evidence, determines that testimony by the victim would be materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that
proceeding
[*874] 4. The right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or
any parole proceeding
5. The reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in the case
6. The right to full and timely restitution as provided in law
7. The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay
8. The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy 78
As in the various state victims' bills of rights, 79 the fairness right is not mere hortatory language. The CVRA introduced these
rights in the statute with the introductory clause: A crime victim has the following rights … . 80 Thus, the right to fairness is

to be given real world application. To be sure, it is a broad right - akin to the defendant's broad right to due process of law. 81
But to implement that right in the criminal rules is not creating new victims rights not based upon the statute, as the Advisory
Committee puts it, but simply implementing a clearly articulated congressional command.
It is a cardinal principle of statutory construction that effect must be given to every word in a statute. 82 Under the Advisory
Committee's approach, the congressional directive that crime victims be treated fairly will have no effect on [*875] any of the
Rules. The fairness directive will, in other words, be rendered mere surplusage - something that the Supreme Court has
repeatedly cautioned against. 83
The Advisory Committee also admits that it is interpreting the CVRA narrowly, contrary to the standard rule that remedial
legislation is to be construed broadly. 84
In addition, the Advisory Committee's approach flouts the declared intentions of the Act's drafters. There is no need to guess
about Congress's intent on the right of fairness. Senator Kyl, who cosponsored the CVRA with Senator Feinstein, explained
quite directly that Congress meant for the right to have substantive content:
The broad rights articulated in this section [section 8, mandating victims be treated with fairness along with dignity and
respect] are meant to be rights themselves and are not intended to just be aspirational. One of these rights is the right to be
treated with fairness. Of course, fairness includes the notion of due process. 85
Nor is there any doubt that Congress intended this command to reach the judiciary, including judicial branch components like
the Advisory Committee. Again, Senator Kyl specifically addressed this point:
Too often victims of crime experience a secondary victimization at the hands of the criminal justice system. This provision
[section 8] is intended to direct government agencies and employees, whether they are in executive or judicial branches, to treat
victims of crime with the respect they deserve and to afford them due process. 86
The Advisory Committee's decision not to treat fairness as an enforceable right is so at odds with the CVRA's legislative
history that one becomes curious as to why the Advisory Committee determined not to follow it. The Advisory Committee also
diverged from the legislative history in several other areas. 87 In reviewing the Advisory Committee's records, however,
notably absent is any mention of legislative intent. The Advisory Committee does not cite the statute's [*876] legislative
treated with fairness, compassion and respect by the criminal justice system); N.M. Const. art. II, § 24(A)(1) (the right to be treated with
fairness and respect for the victim's dignity and privacy throughout the criminal justice process); Ohio Const. art. I, § 10a (victims shall be
accorded fairness, dignity, and respect in the criminal justice process); Tex. Const. art. I, § 30(a)(1) (right to be treated with fairness and
with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy throughout the criminal justice process); Utah Const. art. I, § 28(1)(a) (victim's right to be
treated with fairness, respect, and dignity); Wisc. Const. art. I, § 9m (victim's right to be treated with fairness, dignity and respect for their
privacy). See generally Cassell, Balancing the Scales, supra note 6, at 1387-88 (discussing victim's right to fairness in Utah).

history even once in a twenty-page subcommittee report, in four pages of minutes of its discussions, or in twenty-six pages of
proposed amendments and accompanying Advisory Committee Notes. 88 Perhaps the Advisory Committee took a different
approach than the CVRA's drafters because it did not consider their stated intentions.
If, on the other hand, the Advisory Committee was aware of the drafters' intentions and declined to follow them, it is staking
out a rather unusual path. It is standard practice for the Advisory Committee, no less than courts, to look to legislative history in
crafting the Rules. 89 With respect to the CVRA in particular, many courts have found the CVRA's legislative history highly
instructive. They have good reason for relying on the history. Unlike some contentious pieces of legislation where legislators
possessed divergent views, the CVRA enjoyed a broad, bi-partisan consensus. 90 It passed by a vote of 393 to 14 in the
House 91 and by a voice vote in the Senate. 92 Moreover, the CVRA's cosponsors were bipartisan, and the views they gave on
the legislation were not contradicted by anyone else. Thus, as the Ninth Circuit has explained in construing the CVRA to track
Senator Kyl's and Feinstein's views:
Floor statements by the sponsors of the legislation are given considerably more weight than floor statements by other members,
and they are given even more weight where, as here, other legislators did not offer any contrary views. Silence, the maxim
goes, connotes assent, and so we can draw from the fact that no one registered disagreement with Senators Kyl and Feinstein on
this point the reasonable inference that the views they expressed reflected a consensus, at least in the Senate. 93
In light of all this, it is beyond doubt that crime victims have a substantive right to be treated with fairness (as well as with
respect for their dignity and [*877] privacy) in the federal criminal justice process. Once that right is in mind, the Advisory
Committee has clear duties under the Rules Enabling Act. That Act provides that the Rules shall not abridge, enlarge or
modify any substantive right. 94 Therefore, if any existing rule of criminal procedure abridges or even modifies a victim's
rights to fairness, it is invalid and must be changed. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee must review all the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure to ensure that they protect victims' right to fairness.
B. The Advisory Committee Treats the Right to Fairness Inconsistently
The Advisory Committee claimed that to implement the right to fairness would use the right as a springboard for a variety of
victim rights not otherwise provided for in the CVRA. 95 If so, the Advisory Committee was unable to consistently follow its
own view. The Advisory Committee agreed with my proposed change to Rule 18; that change required that when a court
determines where within a judicial district to hold a trial, it should consider not only the convenience of the defendant and the

witnesses, but also the victim as well. 96 Notably, the Advisory Committee's rationale for this change was to implement[] the
victim's right to be treated with fairness' under the Crime Victims' Rights Act. 97 But if a change to the relatively obscure
Rule 18 is appropriate in light of the victim's right to fairness, why aren't changes to many other, more significant rules also
appropriate?
Further highlighting the inconsistent treatment of the right to fairness is the way the Advisory Committee handled parallel
provisions in the CVRA. In a single clause, the CVRA gives victims the right to be treated not only with fairness, but also with
dignity and respect: section (a)(8) of the CVRA provides that victims shall enjoy the right to be treated with fairness and with
respect for the victim's dignity and privacy. 98 The Advisory Committee used victims' rights to dignity and respect as a
springboard in several places. For example, the Advisory Committee proposed an amendment to prevent inappropriate
subpoenas for personal or confidential information about a victim, explaining that this amendment implements the Crime
Victims Rights Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(8), which states that victims have a right to respect for their dignity and
privacy.' 99 Similarly, the Advisory Committee proposed an amendment to prevent the inappropriate release of a victim's
address and telephone number as part of alibi defense disclosures, explaining that this amendment implements the victims'
rights under the Crime Victims Rights Act … to be treated with respect for the [*878] victim's dignity and privacy. 100 Why
the Advisory Committee believed it appropriate to try to implement the dignity and privacy provisions of the CVRA but not
the immediately adjacent fairness provision is unclear.
C. The Advisory Committee Should Not Leave the CVRA's Interpretation to the Litigation Process.
The Advisory Committee also justified its decision not to review the Rules for fairness on the ground that it would not
attempt to use the rules to anticipate and resolve the interpretative questions that will arise under the CVRA. 101 Yet a basic
purpose - perhaps the basic purpose - behind the procedural rules is to lay out answers to questions that might otherwise have to
be litigated. To that end, Rule 2 of the criminal rules provides that these rules are to be interpreted to provide for the just
determination of every criminal proceeding, to secure simplicity in procedure and fairness in administration, and to eliminate
unjustifiable expense and delay. 102 It is at odds with securing simplicity in procedure to simply regurgitate the language of
the CVRA in the criminal rules, leaving every interpretative question to the vagaries of litigation.
Historical examples are legion of the Advisory Committee amending the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure precisely to
resolve questions that were being (or might have been) litigated. To provide a few straightforward examples, in 1979 the
Advisory Committee amended and clarified the standards for presentence withdrawal of a guilty plea. The Advisory Committee
noted that courts had critically stated that the Rule offers little guidance as to the applicable standard for a presentence
withdrawal of plea and that as a result the contours of [the presentence] standard [in the rule] are not easily defined. 103 The
amendment clarified language which has been a cause of unnecessary confusion. 104

In 1983, the Advisory Committee changed Rule 11(a)(2) to eliminate a split of authority on conditional guilty pleas. One of the
reasons for the change was to produce much needed uniformity in the federal system on this matter. 105
In 1994, the Advisory Committee amended rule 32(b)(2) to give defense counsel an opportunity to be present when probation
officers interviewed their clients while preparing a presentence report. 106 The Advisory Committee Notes explained that while
there was no constitutional right to counsel at this point in the process, caselaw in two circuits suggested that requests of
counsel to be present should be honored as a matter of prudence. 107 What is particularly interesting about [*879] this
example is that the Advisory Committee stepped in to protect the legitimate interests of defendants even in the absence of a
constitutional or statutory command to do so. Of course, the CVRA creates a statutory command to the Advisory Committee to
protect victims' interests.
In 2002, the Advisory Committee amended Rule 51 to provide that court rulings admitting or excluding evidence were
governed by the Federal Rules of Evidence. The reason was to avoid the possibility that an argument might have been made
that an earlier congressional action conflicted with the rules of evidence. 108 In other words, the Advisory Committee simply
anticipated and resolved an interpretive question that might otherwise have arisen.
In 2005, the Advisory Committee amended Rule 12.2 to provide sanctions for a party's failure to disclose certain alibi
information. 109 The reason for the change was to fill[] a gap in the Rules. 110
In these instances, the Advisory Committee stepped in to avoid unnecessary litigation and to clarify the application of the
Rules. Not only is this the Advisory Committee's standard approach, but there are particularly strong reasons for not leaving
clarification of crime victims' rules to case-by-case litigation. The most significant problem is that such litigation will occur
only in fits and starts. Unlike the government and criminal defendants who always have legal representation, crime victims
have no right to appointed counsel and are often indigent or otherwise unable to afford to hire an attorney. 111 As a result, in
many cases it is an empty gesture to promise victims that they can litigate application of the Rules. As a practical matter, they
will often be unable to do so. 112 Indeed, the Advisory Committee seemingly compounds this problem by declining to put into
the Rules any restatement of courts' discretionary authority to appoint counsel for crime victims. 113
Even in cases where victims can afford counsel to defend their legal rights, the kind of litigation that the Advisory Committee
envisions will be unenlightening and formalistic. For instance, while I have proposed including a specific provision in the Rule
11 guilty plea colloquy requiring that the court address a victim before accepting a plea, 114 the Advisory Committee has not
recommended any change. This failure could well spawn litigation about the victims' role in the plea process that will require
courts to consider why Rule 11 fails to mention crime victims and how this failure interplays with the CVRA's commands on

In theory, the government is given authority to assert rights for crime victims, see 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(1) (2006), but in practice the
reported cases under the CVRA thus far show few examples where the government has been willing to do so. See, e.g., Kenna v. U.S. Dist.
Court for the Cent. Dist. of Cal., 435 F.3d 1011, 1018 (9th Cir. 2006) (victims' assertion of right affirmed; government does not take a

victims' rights in the [*880] plea process. Because the CVRA guarantees victims a right in the plea process, its dictates will
ultimately govern. But only the Advisory Committee can pretermit such needless litigation about how to interpret its rules. In
short, it would be much simpler for all concerned if Rule 11 - and, indeed, all the other rules - were redrafted to simply fold
victims in at the appropriate point in the process.
Finally, one of the overriding goals of the CVRA is to dramatically reform the entire approach of the federal criminal justice
system. As Senator Feinstein explained this legislation is meant to correct, not continue, the legacy of the poor treatment of
crime victims in the criminal process. 115 And Senator Kyl added, [a] central reason for these rights is to force a change in a
criminal justice culture which has failed to focus on the legitimate interests of crime victims … . 116 Given Congress's clear
intent to change a hostile legal culture, it makes no sense to leave victims to the mercies of litigation to determine the scope of
their rights.
For all these reasons, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure should be amended not only to implement the narrow rights
articulated in the CVRA but also its more open-ended rights, particularly the victim's right to be treated with fairness.
IV. Specific Rule Changes to Comply with the CVRA
Against the backdrop of the statutory command that victims should be treated with fairness, the balance of this Article will
compare my specific proposals for amending the Rules with those of the Advisory Committee - attempting to show the strong
points of my ideas. For convenience, the Article proceeds sequentially through the Rules from beginning to end, relying in the
case of proposed amendments on the Advisory Committee's numbering.
Rule 1 - Definition of Victim and Victim's Representative The Proposals:
I proposed amending Rule 1 to include a definition of victim and the victim's representatives as follows:
Victim means a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a federal offense or an offense in the
District of Columbia. In the case of a crime victim who is under 18 years of age, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the
legal guardians of the crime victim or the representatives of the crime victim's estate, family members, or any other persons
appointed as suitable by the court, may [*881] assume the crime victim's rights under these rules, but in no event shall the
defendant be named as such guardian or representative. 117
The Advisory Committee instead proposed to cross-reference the statutory definition of crime victim as follows:
Victim means a crime victim as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 3771(e). A person accused of an offense is not a victim of that
offense. 118
Discussion:
The rules should be amended to make clear that both a victim and the victim's representative can assert the victim's rights. As
an effort in that direction, I proposed amending Rule 1 to include a definition of victim as well as a definition of victim's
lawful representative. 119 My definitions were lifted from the CVRA. 120 In response, the Advisory Committee agreed to
include a definition of victim but left to an Advisory Committee Note the reference to the victim's representative. 121

The differences between the two approaches might seem modest until one recognizes that another provision in the Advisory
Committee's proposals appears to intentionally omit any reference to a victim representative. Proposed Rule 60, the Advisory
Committee's global provision dealing with victims' rights, explains who may enforce victims' rights. 122 In clear contrast to
the CVRA's governing provision, this proposed rule omits any reference to a crime victim's representative. Proposed Rule 60
provides only that the rights of a victim under these rules may be asserted by the victim and the attorney for the government.
123 In contrast, the CVRA enforcement provision states: The crime victim or the crime victim's lawful representative, and the
attorney for the Government may assert the rights described in subsection (a). 124 Nothing in the Advisory Committee Notes
indicates that a crime victim's representative is among those authorized to assert the rights. The Advisory Committee also
struck existing [*882] language in the Rules about a victim's representative exercising the victim's right to speak at
sentencing. 125
The repeated omission of any reference to a victim's representative is unsettling given the Advisory Committee's promise to
simply track the CVRA's language. 126 Its failure to track the language here leaves the impression that the Advisory Committee
is uncomfortable with a victim's representative asserting rights. Perhaps the Committee could make a policy argument against
such representation, but Congress has said victims have the right to have representatives speak for them. The Federal Rules
should follow the CVRA and state clearly that a victim's representative can assert a victim's rights.
The need for clarity on this point is heightened by pre-CVRA caselaw questioning any right by a victim's representative to
assert victims' rights. Most notably, in one of the Oklahoma City bombing prosecutions, the Tenth Circuit rebuked a trial judge
for permitting an attorney for the bombing victims to participate in oral argument at a sentencing hearing. 127 The Circuit
stated that in the absence of any authority permitting the participation of victims' counsel, we harbor concerns about the
propriety of the district court's rulings. 128 This statement can no longer be regarded as good law in light of the CVRA's
commands. 129
Another reason for clarity is to make sure that corporate and organizational victims are able to be heard in the process. The
CVRA's definition of victim - a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a Federal offense
130 - is essentially lifted from federal restitution statutes. 131 Federal courts have consistently held that a person entitled to
restitution includes corporate entities. 132 Of course, such legal entities cannot appear personally but only through [*883] a

representative. To eliminate any doubt about the ability of corporate entities to assert their interests, the Rules should be
amended to clearly state that a victim's representative can enforce victims' rights. 133
Rule 2 - Fairness to Victims The Proposals:
I proposed amending Rule 2 to require fairness to victims in construing the Rules as follows:
These rules are to be interpreted to provide for the just determination of every criminal proceeding, to secure simplicity in
procedure and fairness in administration to the government, defendants, and victims, and to eliminate unjustifiable expense and
delay. 134
The Advisory Committee did not propose amending Rule 2. 135
Discussion:
To assure that crime victims are treated fairly throughout the process, it makes sense to add language incorporating crime
victims in Rule 2 - the one rule that specifically mentions fairness. As discussed in the previous Part of this Article, the
Advisory Committee does not agree that the Rules should be amended to protect a victim's right to fairness and for this reason,
presumably, declined to amend Rule 2. The qualifier presumably is needed here because the CVRA Subcommittee did not
give an explanation for declining to follow my recommendation here. 136
The fairness issues appears to be the fundamental difference between my approach and the Advisory Committee's approach -
the Rules are either going to treat crime victims fairly or not. As discussed in the previous Part of this Article, they should.
But even those who share my view on fairness might nonetheless argue that Rule 2 need not be amended because it is an
interpretive rule with no substantive effect. After all, it could be argued, the rule simply calls for a just determination of
criminal cases, arguably a symbolic command. And, in any event, that command might be flexible enough to encompass crime
victims.
[*884] The debate about how Rule 2 ought to read is, however, about more than symbols. In 1946, the initial chairman of the
Advisory Committee called Rule 2 the most important rule of the whole set. 137 Rule 2 has been cited by a number of courts,
138 including the Supreme Court. 139 Rule 2 has consequences. Not only does it set[] forth a principle of interpretation for
judge could not require the wrongdoers to pay restitution … .); United States v. Kirkland, 853 F.2d 1243, 1246 (5th Cir. 1988) (Non-human
entities … can be victims' entitled to restitution … .); see also United States v. Lincoln, 277 F.3d 1112, 1113-14 (9th Cir. 2002) (discussing
18 U.S.C. § 3664, which specifically recognizes the United States as a possible victim for restitution purposes).
133
The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers has proposed adding a factfinding hearing for determining who qualifies as a
victim under the CVRA. This novel and cumbersome proposal is discussed below. See infra notes 546-547 and accompanying text

ambiguous rules, but the Court has used it as a basis for deviating from the Rules in some circumstances. 140 Indeed, in some
lower court cases, Rule 2 has proven outcome determinative. For example, in United States v. Broadus, the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia used Rule 2 as a basis for deviating from the time limits imposed by Rule 29(c) for
the defendant to seek a new trial. 141 Relying on Rule 2, the court determined that a seemingly plausible inference from a
criminal rule cannot command blind adherence if it would deprive an accused person … of a just determination of his or her
cause. 142 Using Rule 2 to protect defendants' legitimate interests seems entirely proper. But crime victims need the same
textual support to secure their legitimate interests.
Not only is Rule 2 important, directly including crime victims in the language is important as well. Courts are used to resolving
disputes between prosecutors and defendants, not considering the interests of crime victims. 143 That problem is, indeed, the
whole reason for the passage of the CVRA. As Senator Feinstein has explained, In case after case we found victims and their
families were ignored, cast aside, and treated as non-participants in a critical event in their lives. They were kept in the dark by
… judges focused on defendant's rights, and by a court system that simply did not have a place for them. 144 For all these
reasons, Rule 2 should be amended to make clear that the Rules must be construed to be fair not only to the parties, but also to
victims.
[*885] Rule 11(a)(3) - Victims' Views on Nolo Contendere Pleas The Proposals:
I proposed requiring courts to consider a victim's view before accepting any nolo contendere plea as follows:
Nolo Contendere Plea. Before accepting a plea of nolo contendere, the court must consider the parties' and victims' views and
the public interest in the effective administration of justice. 145
The Advisory Committee proposed no change to the rule. 146
Discussion:
It is unclear why the Advisory Committee declined to change Rule 11 to require courts to consider victims' views on nolo
pleas. The CVRA Subcommittee purported to catalog and briefly discuss all of my proposals that the subcommittee declined to
recommend to the full Committee. Inexplicably, my Rule 11(a)(3) proposal (along with my other Rule 11 proposals) was not
mentioned 147 and, thus, there is nothing in the available records to indicate that the Advisory Committee considered it.
Possibly the reason the Advisory Committee did not recommend this change was simply oversight.
Perhaps the Advisory Committee was relying on its global rule on victims' rights (Rule 60) which provides that the court
must permit a victim to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court concerning … [a] plea … involving
the crime. 148 But that rule deals solely with the subject of being heard. Once the court has heard the victim, the question

remains what the court should do with the victim's statement. Currently Rule 11(a)(3) specifies that the court must consider
the parties' views on a nolo plea - but it makes no mention of the victim's views. 149 The CVRA now mandates that victims
must be reasonably heard at any proceeding involving a plea. 150 It is hard to see how anyone could argue that a victim is
reasonably heard when, after making a [*886] statement about the nolo plea, the court is not required to even consider it. The
rule should be amended to require courts to consider victims' statements.
Rule 11(b)(4) - Victims' Right To Be Heard on Pleas
The Proposals:
I proposed that the court should be required to address any victim present when a plea is taken to determine whether the victim
wishes to make a statement and to consider the victim's view before accepting a plea, as follows:
Victims' Views. Before the court accepts a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or allows any plea to be withdrawn, the court must
address any victim who is present personally in open court. During this address, the court must determine whether the victim
wishes to present views regarding the proposed plea or withdrawal and, if so, what those views are. The court shall consider the
victim's views in acting on the proposed plea or withdrawal. 151
The Advisory Committee recommended no change to Rule 11. 152
Discussion:
It is hard to understand why the Advisory Committee declined to recommend changing Rule 11 to require that victims be
addressed, as it did not discuss the idea. 153 If the Advisory Committee deliberately rejected this idea, it has given no
explanation and it is hard to see any justification for the Advisory Committee's position. The CVRA gives victims the right to
be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving … [a] plea. 154 To implement the victim's right to
be heard regarding a plea, my proposed rule change merely required the court to directly address any victim who is present in
court and to consider any views the victim expressed. This is consistent with the CVRA's legislative history which explains that
this provision is intended to allow crime victims to directly address the court in person. 155 The language of the proposed
rule is lifted from an earlier paragraph in Rule 11, which requires the court before accepting a plea of guilty to address the
defendant personally in open court. 156 Victims should be treated evenhandedly with defendants. It may also be important for
the judge to address victims directly because many victims will lack [*887] the assistance of counsel. Untrained in legal
proceedings, victims may be uncertain about exactly when in the process they should present their views. Having the court
address the victim will eliminate that uncertainty and ensure that the victim's right to be heard is vindicated.
The Advisory Committee's global rule on victims' rights (Rule 60) does briefly address pleas. Tracking language in the
CVRA, the Advisory Committee would require the court to permit a victim to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding …
149
The rule does mention that the court must consider the public interest in the effective administration of justice in reviewing a nolo plea.
See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(a)(3). But this broad phrase does not appear to encompass the views of particular actors regarding a plea, as made
clear by the fact that the rule separately lists the parties' views as something the court must consider.

concerning … [a] plea. 157 But this brief mention in the rule is inferior to my specific proposal for several reasons. First, Rule
11 is the script when federal judges accept guilty pleas. Victims should be directly included here so that judges do not
inadvertently overlook victims' rights. Second, stating only that victims may be reasonably heard regarding a plea, without
explaining how that will occur, invites litigation and uncertainty. For example, is a victim reasonably heard when allowed to be
heard only through written submission? 158 Is a victim treated fairly if the court is required to address the defendant in open
court but not to address the victim? If the court does not address the victim, when should the victim try to interrupt the
proceedings to be heard? Should the victim's views enter into the court's calculation about whether to accept the plea? All of
these questions are answered in a simple and straightforward way by my proposal - a proposal which the Advisory Committee
should adopt.
Rule 11(c)(1) - Prosecution To Consider Victims' Views on Pleas The Proposals:
I proposed that the prosecution should be required to consider victims' views in developing any proposed plea arrangement as
follows:
(1) In General. An attorney for the government and the defendant's attorney, or the defendant when proceeding pro se, may
discuss and reach a plea agreement. The court must not participate in these discussions. The attorney for the government shall
make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider the victims' views about, any proposed plea negotiations. If
the defendant pleads guilty or nolo contendere to either a charged offense or a lesser or related offense, [*888] the plea
agreement may specify that an attorney for the government will … [listing various options]. 159
The Advisory Committee did not recommend any change. 160
Discussion:
My proposed change required prosecutors to make reasonable efforts to notify victims about pleas and to consider the victims'
views regarding pleas. This requirement was taken almost verbatim from the Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and
Witness Assistance, which already directs prosecutors to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider
victims' views about, prospective plea negotiations. 161 According to the Department of Justice, twenty-nine states [already]
require prosecutors to consult with' or obtain the views of' victims at the plea agreement stage. 162

be reasonably heard does not mandate oral statements, particularly when the [victim] has no personal knowledge of the guilt of the
defendant(s) and offers an opinion only on a matter that is not in dispute).

Perhaps the Advisory Committee overlooked this proposed change. 163 Yet it is important, implementing not only a victim's
right to be heard at plea proceedings but also the rights to confer with the attorney for the government 164 and to be treated
with fairness. 165 Given that victims have the right to confer, the conferring should take place at the most salient points in the
process. As Senator Feinstein explained, This right [to confer] is intended to be expansive. For example, the victim has the
right to confer with the Government concerning any critical stage or disposition of the case. 166 Because the overwhelming
majority of federal criminal cases are resolved by a plea, a conference between the victim and the prosecutor regarding the plea
will be critical in most cases. Reflecting that fact, the Rules should follow the approach of the majority of states in directing
prosecutors to consult with victims about pleas.
[*889] Rule 11(c)(2) - Court to Be Advised of Victim Objections to Plea The Proposals:
I proposed that prosecutors and victims' attorneys should be required to advise the court whenever they are aware that the
victim objects to a proposed plea agreement as follows:
(2) Disclosing a Plea Agreement. The parties must disclose the plea agreement in open court when the plea is offered, unless
the court for good cause allows the parties to disclose the plea agreement in camera. When a plea is presented in open court, the
attorney for the government or the attorney for any victim shall advise the court when the attorney is aware that the victim has
any objection to the proposed plea agreement. 167
The Advisory Committee proposed no change to this rule. 168
Discussion:
In circumstances where an attorney, either for the government or for the victim, is aware of a victim's objection to a plea, that
information should be relayed to the court. The victim's attorney will, no doubt, do this on her own initiative. The rule is
intended to clarify that the prosecutor is under an equal obligation to communicate this information to the court.
While the Advisory Committee may have overlooked this proposal, 169 the change is necessary because the CVRA implicitly
obligates prosecutors to communicate a victim's objection to the court. The CVRA commands that prosecutors use their best
efforts to enforce victims' rights. 170 Victims are often untrained in the law and unexpectedly thrust into criminal proceedings;
they may well believe that prosecutors automatically relay their objections to the plea to the court. The proposed rule avoids
confusion by requiring the prosecutor to notify the court of a victim's concern. The rule is limited to situations where the
prosecutor is aware of an objection.
This approach is consistent with the leading case of State v. Casey, 171 which considered whether a victim's request to be heard
regarding a plea made to the [*890] prosecutor was sufficient to trigger the victim's constitutional right to be heard. 172 In

Casey, the victim told the prosecutor that she wished to be heard in opposition to a plea. The prosecutor refused to convey that
information to the court and the trial judge accepted the plea. When the issue reached the Utah Supreme Court, the court
concluded that the prosecutor had an ethical obligation as an officer of the court to convey that information to the judge:
Prosecutors must convey such requests [to be heard] because they are obligated to alert the court when they know that the court
lacks relevant information. This duty, which is incumbent upon all attorneys, is magnified for prosecutors because, as our case
law has repeatedly noted, prosecutors have unique responsibilities… . The prosecutor is the representative not of an ordinary
party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern
at all; and whose interest … in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win … but that justice shall be done. 173
Applying the reasoning of Casey to analogous rights in the CVRA, federal prosecutors must, as officers of the court, convey a
victim's request to be heard regarding a plea. Indeed, the prosecutor should convey not only that request to be heard but also the
fact that the victim has an objection to the plea. In deciding whether to accept a plea, the court must consider the public interest.
174 As the Courts of Appeals have explained, Rule 11 also contemplates the rejection of a negotiated plea when the district
court believes that bargain is too lenient, or otherwise not in the public interest.' 175 When the prosecutor is aware of an
objection from a keenly interested member of the public - the victim - the court should not be left in the dark about it, as
provided in my proposed rule. 176
[*891] Rules 12.1 and 12.3 - Victim Addresses and Phone Numbers Not Disclosed for Alibi and Public-Authority Defense
Purposes The Proposals:
Rule 12.1 currently requires the government to disclose the address and telephone numbers of any witness, including any
victim, that it plans to use to disprove a defendant's alibi. I proposed amending Rule 12.1 to protect the victim's privacy, by
excluding their addresses and telephone numbers from this requirement as follows:
(a) Government's Request for Notice and Defendant's Response.
(1) Government's Request. An attorney for the government may request in writing that the defendant notify an attorney for the
government of any intended alibi defense. The request must state the time, date, and place of the alleged offense.
(2) Defendant's Response. Within 10 days after the request, or at some other time the court sets, the defendant must serve
written notice on an attorney for the government of any intended alibi defense. The defendant's notice must state:
(A) each specific place where the defendant claims to have been at the time of the alleged offense;
(B) the name, address, and telephone number of each alibi witness and the address and telephone number of each witness (other
than a victim) on whom the defendant intends to rely. 177
(b) Disclosing Government Witnesses.

(1) Disclosure. If the defendant serves a Rule 12.1(a)(2) notice [regarding intent to present an alibi defense], an attorney for the
government must disclose in writing to the defendant or 178 the defendant's attorney:
(A) the name, address, and telephone number of each witness and the address and telephone number of each witness (other than
a victim) that the government intends to rely on to establish the defendant's presence at the scene of the alleged offense; and
(B) each government rebuttal witness to the defendant's alibi defense.
[*892] (2) Time to Disclose. Unless the court directs otherwise, an attorney for the government must give its Rule 12.1(b)(1)
disclosure within 10 days after the defendant serves notice of an intended alibi defense under Rule 12.1(a)(2), but no later than
10 days before trial.
(c) Continuing Duty to Disclose. Both an attorney for the government and the defendant must promptly disclose in writing to
the other party the name of each additional witness, and the address and telephone number of each additional witness (other
than a victim) if:
(1) the disclosing party learns of the witness before or during trial; and
(2) the witness should have been disclosed under Rule 12.1(a) or (b) if the disclosing party had known of the witness earlier.
179
In addition, I proposed making a similar change to Rule 12.3 regarding the address and telephone number of victims who will
be used to disprove a public-authority defense. 180
The Advisory Committee proposed more limited protection for victims' addresses and telephone numbers:
(b) Disclosing Government Witnesses.
(1) Disclosure.
(A) In general. If the defendant serves a Rule 12.1(a)(2) notice, an attorney for the government must disclose in writing to the
defendant or the defendant's attorney:
(i) (A) the name, address, and telephone number of each witness and the address and telephone number of each witness (other
than a victim) that the government intends to rely on to establish the defendant's presence at the scene of the alleged offense;
and
(ii) (B) each governmental rebuttal witness to the defendant's alibi defense.
(B) Victim's Address and Telephone Number. If the government intends to rely on a victim's testimony to establish the
defendant's presence at the scene of the alleged offense and the defendant establishes a need for the victim's address and
telephone number, the court may:
(i) order the government to provide the information in writing to the defendant or the defendant's attorney; or
[*893] (ii) fashion a reasonable procedure that allows the preparation of the defense and also protects the victim's interests.

(c) Continuing Duty to Disclose.

(1) In General. Both an attorney for the government and the defendant must promptly disclose in writing to the other party the
name, of each additional witness and the address, and telephone number of each additional witness - other than a victim - if:
(A) (1) the disclosing party learns of the witness before or during trial; and
(B) (2) the witness should have been disclosed under Rule 12.1(a) or (b) if the disclosing party had known of the witness
earlier.
(2) Address and Telephone Number of an Additional Victim Witness. The telephone number and address of an additional
victim witness must not be disclosed except as provided in (b)(1)(B).
(d) Exceptions. For good cause, the court may grant an exception to any requirement of Rule 12.1(a)-(c). 181
The Advisory Committee also proposed adding an Advisory Committee Note as follows:
Subdivisions (b) and (c). The amendment implements the Crime Victims' Rights Act, which states that victims have the right
to be reasonably protected from the accused, and to be treated with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy. See 18 U.S.C. §
3771(a)(1) & (8). The rule provides that a victim's address and telephone number should not automatically be provided to the
defense when an alibi defense is raised. If a defendant establishes a need for this information, the court has discretion to order
its disclosure or to fashion an alternative procedure that provides the defendant with the information necessary to prepare a
defense, but also protects the victim's interests. For example, the court might authorize the defendant and his counsel to meet
with the victim in a manner and place designated by the court, rather than giving the defendant the name and address of a
victim who fears retaliation if the defendant learns where he or she lives.
In the case of victims who will testify concerning an alibi claim, the same procedures and standards apply to both the
prosecutor's initial [*894] disclosure and the prosecutor's continuing duty to disclose under subdivision (c). 182
Discussion:
The Advisory Committee agrees with me that the current rule providing that a victim's address and telephone number be
automatically disclosed whenever an alibi is at stake conflicts with the CVRA. 183 This information can often be very sensitive
for a crime victim, as it could allow the defendant to find and harm a victim. The difference between our proposals is that I
would strike the requirement that a victim's address and telephone number be disclosed to the defense while the Advisory
Committee would add specific language allowing a court to order production of the address and telephone number based on a
defense showing of need. 184
The Advisory Committee's approach highlights an inconsistency in the way it handles defendants' and victims' interests. It has
chosen to spell out in the Rules how a defendant can obtain access to a victim's address and telephone number. Of course, if the
Constitution or a statute already requires the prosecutor to turn over that personal information, any rule is irrelevant.
Presumably, the reason that the Advisory Committee added the language is because it knows that the language is not irrelevant
- that is, that the Constitution and statute do not always require production of this information. 185 Obviously, nothing is wrong
with the Advisory Committee drafting rules that go beyond the Constitution and statutes to protect defendants' legitimate
interests. That approach is, indeed, commendable. What is wrong is for the Committee to work through its rules to make sure

defendants are treated fairly - even in the absence of an overarching statutory command to that effect - while not doing the
same for crime victims, even where the CVRA directly commands that victims be treated with fairness. 186
In any event, the Advisory Committee's proposal is decidedly unfair. The Committee proposes a two-pronged approach:
If the government intends to rely on a victim's testimony to establish the defendant's presence at the scene of the alleged
offense and the defendant establishes a need for the victim's address and telephone number, the court may:
[*895] (i) order the government to provide the information in writing to the defendant or the defendant's attorney; or
(ii) fashion a reasonable procedure that allows the preparation of the defense and also protects the victim's interests. 187
Notice that the court can order disclosure of the victim's address upon a mere showing by the defendant of a need, by
proceeding under subparagraph (i) of the proposed rule; the requirement to protect the victim's interests is triggered only if the
court chooses to proceed under paragraph (ii). And the proposed rule fails to give any guidance on when the court should
proceed under paragraph (ii) as opposed to paragraph (i).
The Advisory Committee's provision for two ways in which the court can avoid the requirements of withholding a victim's
name seems unnecessary. Subsection (d) of Rule 12.1 already allows a court to grant an exception to any of the requirements of
the rule for good cause. 188 This exception has been used to justify the government's nondisclosure of its witnesses in
situations where their safety might be jeopardized. 189 There is, accordingly, no need to add wiggle room language in Rule
12.1.
More important, the Advisory Committee's approach is fundamentally flawed. It makes no sense to require that the victim's
interests be considered only half the time - i.e., only where the court proceeds under paragraph (ii) but not under paragraph (i).
More important, since the Advisory Committee appears to agree that disclosing a victim's address raises obvious safety
concerns, allowing disclosure without any consideration of the victim's interests violates the CVRA's command that the victim
must be reasonably protected from the accused. 190 A court proceeding under paragraph (i) would be under no obligation to
protect[] the victim's interests (as paragraph (ii) specifically provides), since it is a standard rule of construction that expressio
unius est exclusio alterius (the expression of one thing implies the exclusion of the other). 191 At a bare minimum, the CVRA
requires redrafting the rule so that the court always considers victims' interests before it can order production of a victim's
address.
Also interesting are the choices that the Advisory Committee specifically lists for a judge. The options given are (i) order the
government to provide the information in writing or (ii) fashion a reasonable procedure that allows the preparation of the
defense and also protects the victim's interests. The listing of these two (and only these two) options seems to imply that the
court does not have [*896] a third option - i.e., (iii) decline to order a victim's address be turned over. It is simply not the case
that every time the defendant can establish a need for information - no matter how trivial or how remotely connected to the
case - the court should either disclose a victim's address or fashion some other procedure toward the same end.

Even where the defendant can establish need, it may be the case that victims' safety interests will prevail. For example, in
United States v. Wills, the district court allowed the government to delay the disclosure of the name of a witness because the
witness feared for her safety and the defendant had a violent history. 192 On appeal to the Ninth Circuit, the defendant sought
reversal of his conviction, arguing that the district court abused its discretion in finding good cause to permit the government
to withhold [the witness] from its alibi rebuttal list and witness list. 193 Before his trial, Wills had provided the government
with the name of one alibi witness. In response, the government filed a sealed, ex parte application under Rule 12.1(e) seeking
an exception to its obligation to disclose its alibi rebuttal witness to the defense. 194 Based on the defendant's violent history
and apparent ability to induce others to commit crimes on his behalf, the court allowed the government to delay the
disclosure of the witness. 195
The Wills court noted that two other circuits had addressed or commented on the issue. The Sixth Circuit, in United States v.
Causey, held that good cause existed to justify the nondisclosure of a witness to the defense. 196 The Causey court found
evidence in the record indicating that witnesses were being threatened in an attempt to prevent them from testifying. 197 In
such a situation, the physical safety and protection of potential witnesses constitutes a proper consideration of a trial court in
determining whether good cause exists to justify nondisclosure of witnesses to opposing counsel and thus noncompliance with
Rule 12.1. 198 Similarly, in United States v. Elizondo, the Seventh Circuit cited Causey for the proposition that the protection
of potential witnesses could justify postponing disclosure. 199 Following the reasoning of the Sixth and Seventh Circuits, Wills
held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that good cause existed to authorize the Government to delay
disclosure of [the witness's] identity. 200
The Advisory Committee might respond to these criticisms of its proposal by pointing to discretionary language; the proposed
rule states that the court may order production of the evidence or the fashioning of an alternative procedure. But given the
obvious safety concerns that attend disclosure of the victim's home [*897] address to the defense, the Advisory Committee
should exercise extreme caution. More important, courts have no discretion to ignore the commands of the CVRA. Courts must
always protect a victim's right to be reasonably protected from the accused. 201 The proposed rule does not faithfully
implement that instruction. Indeed, the safety problems attendant to the Advisory Committee's proposal are heightened by fact
that disclosure is authorized to the defendant or the defendant's attorney. It does not take a great deal of imagination to
foresee problems arising from telling criminal defendants where the victims who will testify against them live. In fairness to the
Advisory Committee, it was only tracking language used elsewhere in Rule 12. 202 All of Rule 12 should be redrafted to
require disclosure only to defense counsel, rather than to the defendant personally. 203

This may be a convenient place to highlight another defect in the Advisory Committee's proposal - crime victims have no right
to be heard on whether their address should be given to the defendant. As discussed shortly, 204 I had originally proposed
allowing victims to be heard on any matter directly affecting a victim's right - for example, whether disclosing a victim's
home address violates the victim's right to reasonable protection. The Advisory Committee waters down that proposal,
recommending only that the victim must be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court concerning release,
plea, or sentencing involving the crime. 205 Under the Advisory Committee's formulation, therefore, crime victims would
seem to have no right to be heard on disclosure of their address. This is not a matter concerning release, plea, or sentencing
and, in many cases, this issue will be decided by written pleadings rather than in a public proceeding. Nothing better
illustrates the unfairness of the Advisory Committee's proposals and their illegality under the CVRA than its refusal to
guarantee that crime victims will be heard on the subject of whether their home address will be turned over to the defendants
accused of victimizing them.
Compounding all these problems is one more: The Advisory Committee appears to encourage the use of crime victim
depositions or other face-to-face meetings between victims and defendants. In its proposed note to the amended rule, the
Advisory Committee describes as one possible procedure for dealing with a defense request for a victim's home address that
the court might authorize the defendant and his counsel to meet with the victim in a manner and place designated by the court,
rather than giving the defendant the name and address of victim. 206 This note raises a host of problems. Most importantly, a
federal court lacks jurisdiction to require a crime victim to appear at a face-to-face, pretrial [*898] meeting with the defendant.
The federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, 207 and federal judges have no general power to compel private citizens
to meet with defendants before a trial. 208 Moreover, the Advisory Committee seems to envision that such orders could issue
without the victim even being heard on the subject, a deprivation of liberty without due process of law. 209
Even if the court had authority and had considered a victim's arguments, a face-to-face meeting with the defendant raises other
problems. Such a meeting is a deposition in all but name. Yet Rule 15 provides stringent limits on the circumstances in which a
defendant can depose a victim. In particular, any deposition is limited to exceptional circumstances and a deposition for
discovery purposes is not permitted. 210 The Advisory Committee Note suggesting a meeting between a victim and a defendant
does an end run around these limitations. 211
In light of all these concerns, the best approach is simply to strike the existing requirement that a victim's address and phone
number be turned over as part of an alibi defense, as I proposed. It should also be noted that this proposal raises no due process
concerns that might stem from a one-sided reciprocal discovery rule. My proposal applies even handedly to both prosecution
and the defense. Neither side is required to disclose the address or telephone number of a victim, thus complying with the
Supreme Court's instruction that in the absence of a strong showing of state interests to the contrary, discovery must be a two-

way street. 212 In any event, protecting victims from serious harm is certainly a strong state interest that would justify any
incidental effect on defense preparations for trial.
Finally, however one ends up on the proper formulation of the address issue under Rule 12.1 (governing alibi defenses), the
same formulation ought to be used in Rule 12.3 (governing public-authority defenses). Although I made this recommendation
in a previous article, 213 the Advisory Committee appears to have overlooked this parallel provision in need of amendment. So
that it is not overlooked again, I will set out the proposal in full. Tracking my recommendations for Rule 12.1, I recommended
a parallel amendment to Rule 12.3 as follows:
[*899]
Rule 12.3 Notice of a Public-Authority Defense
… .
(4) Disclosing Witnesses.
(A) Government's Request. An attorney for the government may request in writing that the defendant disclose the name,
address, and telephone number of each witness and the address and telephone number of each witness (other than the victim)
the defendant intends to rely on to establish a public-authority defense. An attorney for the government may serve the request
when the government serves its response to the defendant's notice under Rule 12.3(a)(3), or later, but must serve the request no
later than 20 days before trial.
(B) Defendant's Response. Within 7 days after receiving the government's request, the defendant must serve on an attorney for
the government a written statement of the name, address and telephone number of each witness. and the address and telephone
number of each witness (other than the victim).
(C) Government's Reply. Within 7 days after receiving the defendant's statement, an attorney for the government must serve on
the defendant or the defendant's attorney a written statement of the name, address, and telephone number of each witness, and
the address and telephone number of each witness (other than the victim), the government intends to rely on to oppose the
defendant's public-authority defense.
(b) Continuing Duty to Disclose. Both an attorney for the government and the defendant must promptly disclose in writing to
the other party the name, address, and telephone number of any additional witness and the address and telephone number of
each witness (other than the victim) if:
(1) the disclosing party learns of the witness before or during trial; and
(2) the witness should have been disclosed under Rule 12.3(a)(4) if the disclosing party had known of the witness earlier. 214
[*900] Rule 15 - Victims' Right to Attend Pre-Trial Depositions The Proposals:
I proposed amending Rule 15 to allow victims to attend any public depositions as follows:
(i) Victims Can Attend. Victims can attend any public deposition taken under this rule under the same conditions as govern a
victim's attendance at trial. 215

The Advisory Committee did not propose any change to Rule 15. 216
Discussion:
Rule 15 authorizes depositions for the purpose of preserving evidence for trial, 217 thus, such depositions are an extension of
the trial. Victims, accordingly, have the right to attend such proceedings, if they are public, 218 under the same conditions
governing their attendance at trial. To avoid any confusion over this issue, the proposed rule change directly states that fact.
The Advisory Committee declined to adopt this recommendation, concluding that depositions do not fall within the CVRA,
which refers only to the victim's right not to be excluded from public court proceedings.' 219 But here, again, the Committee
has taken too narrow a view of the CVRA. It is simply unfair to victims to exclude them from a deposition in a criminal case -
and, thus, a violation of the CVRA's command that victims be treated with fairness.
The simplest proof of this conclusion is to consider the rights of criminal defendants at depositions. Rule 15 directly guarantees
criminal defendants a right to attend a deposition. 220 Originally the rule was silent on a defendant's presence, but in the 1975
enactment of the rule, 221 a defendant was guaranteed the right to attend. 222 Presumably, a major reason the Advisory
Committee added this language [*901] was to ensure fairness to defendants. 223 Indeed, after an indictment, Rule 15
depositions might constitute a critical stage' in a prosecution - requiring the presence of counsel - because of the potential
consequences of such depositions at trial. 224 Just as the Advisory Committee acted in 1975 to ensure defendants were treated
fairly at criminal depositions, it should now do the same for victims.
Victims also deserve the right to attend pretrial depositions because they are now participants in the criminal justice process. As
the Fifth Circuit explained in reversing a trial court which had allowed an ex parte deposition, depositions are never ordered
where one party to the suit can be present, ask the questions, and hear the answers, and the opposing party in the case is not
only prevented from being present and asking questions, but is also denied even the opportunity to know what the questions
and answers are. 225 The Fifth Circuit further noted that such a procedure is not only wholly unauthorized, it is contrary to
the most basic presuppositions of our adversary system of litigation. 226 Because a crime victim is now an independent

Part of the rationale may have also been to facilitate admission of the deposition testimony at trial, as a defendant has a right to confront
adverse witnesses at trial. But the Confrontation Clause does not always guarantee defendants a right to attend a deposition, see, for example,
United States v. Salim, 855 F.2d 944, 955 (2d Cir. 1988), so the defendant's right to attend the deposition must rest on a broader justification
than implementing constitutional requirements.

participant in the proceedings, 227 the same considerations demand that victims be able to attend a pretrial deposition. To be
sure, crime victims (like other members of the public) will have the opportunity to hear deposition testimony when it is
introduced at trial. 228 But that may be a pale substitute for actually observing a witness testify in person. 229 Victims may
also be able to facilitate the truth-seeking process by watching witnesses at the deposition and alerting prosecutors or defense
attorneys to any false statements that are being made. 230 Rule 15 should, therefore, be amended to ensure that crime victims
have a right to attend any deposition.
Rule 17 - Victims' Right to Notice of Subpoena of Confidential Information
The Proposals:
I recommended amending Rule 17 to ensure that subpoenas to third parties seeking personal and confidential information about
crime victims would not be [*902] abused. Initially, I proposed requiring a court determination of relevance at trial and notice
to a victim as follows:
Rule 17(h)(2) - Victim Information. After indictment, no record or document containing personal or confidential information
about a victim may be subpoenaed without a finding by the court that the information is relevant to trial and that compliance
appears to be reasonable. If the court makes such a finding, notice shall then be given to the victim, through the attorney for the
government or for the victim, before the subpoena is served. On motion made promptly by the victim, the court may quash or
modify the subpoena if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive. 231
The Advisory Committee proposed more limited protections for such information as follows:
Rule 17(c)(3) - Subpoena for Personal or Confidential Information About Victim. After a complaint, indictment, or information
is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of personal or confidential information about a victim may not be served on a third
party without a court order, which may be granted ex parte. Before entering the order, the court may require that notice be
given to the victim so that the victim has an opportunity to move to quash or modify the subpoena. 232
The Advisory Committee also proposed the following note to accompany the rule change:
Subdivision(c)(3). This amendment implements the Crime Victims' Rights Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(8), which
states that victims have a right to respect for their dignity and privacy. The rule provides a protective mechanism when the
defense subpoenas a third party to provide personal or confidential information about a victim. Third party subpoenas raise
special concerns because a third party may not assert the victim's interests, and the victim may be unaware of the subpoena.
Accordingly, the amendment requires judicial approval before service of a subpoena seeking personal or confidential
information about a victim from a third party. The amendment also provides a mechanism for notifying the victim, and makes
it clear that a victim may move to quash or modify the subpoena under Rule 17(c)(2) on the grounds that it is unreasonable or
oppressive.
The amendment applies only to subpoenas served after a complaint, indictment, or information has been filed. It has no
application to grand [*903] jury subpoenas. When the grand jury seeks the production of personal or confidential information,
grand jury secrecy affords substantial protection for the victim's privacy and dignity interests.

The amendment seeks to protect the interests of the victim without unfair prejudice to the defense. It permits the defense to
seek judicial approval of the subpoena ex parte, because requiring the defendant to make and support the request in an
adversarial setting may force premature disclosure of defense strategy to the government. The court may approve or reject the
subpoena ex parte, or it may provide notice to the victim, who may then move to quash. In exercising its discretion, the court
should consider the relevance of the subpoenaed material to the defense, whether giving notice would prejudice the defense,
and the degree to which the subpoenaed material implicates the privacy and dignity interests of the victim. 233
Having seen the Advisory Committee proposal and accompanying note, I am concerned that the limits on subpoenas found in
the United States Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Nixon 234 might be vitiated by a broad rule. To ensure courts
consistently apply Nixon's substantive and procedural standards to victim-related subpoenas, I am modifying my earlier
proposal to require a court determination of specificity, relevance, and admissibility at trial, as well as notice to the victim, as
follows (new language italicized):
Rule 17(c)(3) - Subpoena for Personal or Confidential Information About Victim. After a complaint, indictment, or information
is filed, no record or document containing personal or confidential information about a victim may be subpoenaed without a
finding by the court that the information is specifically described, relevant to and admissible at trial, and that compliance
appears to be reasonable. If the court makes such a tentative finding, notice shall then be given to the victim, through the
attorney for the government or for the victim, before the subpoena is served. On motion made promptly by the victim, the court
may quash or modify the subpoena if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive and may ask the court to revisit any
tentative findings. A subpoena shall not be used for discovery purposes or to obtain information for impeachment at trial.
Discussion:
The issues involved in the Rule 17 amendments are complicated and very important. It is useful to divide the discussion into
three parts: (1) the problem the proposals address; (2) the procedural flaws in the Advisory Committee's proposal [*904]
allowing ex parte subpoenas; and (3) the general lack of authority for subpoenas seeking crime victim information.
(1) The Problem of Subpoenaing Confidential Victim Information
The existing rules governing subpoenas are flawed because they allow the parties to subpoena personal or confidential
information about a victim from third parties without the victim knowing. This issue was highlighted recently in the notorious
Utah state criminal proceedings involving the kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart. 235 Attorneys for Elizabeth's alleged kidnapper
subpoenaed class records from her high school (class and teacher lists, report cards, and disciplinary and attendance records)
and medical records from her hospital. 236 The school turned over the requested records without notice to the Smart family,
while the hospital refused to turn over the requested records. When Elizabeth's father learned that her school records had been
turned over to defense counsel, he filed a motion to have the records returned to the school. Prosecutors in the case also
objected that they were not given an opportunity to file a motion to quash prior to the production of the records. 237 The matter
is apparently still under review in the state courts.
The problem that occurred in the Smart case under the Utah state rules could occur under the federal rules, as the attorney for
Elizabeth Smart pointed out to the Advisory Committee in a letter. 238 The federal rules currently permit an objection from the

witness to whom the subpoena for documents or records is issued, 239 but there is no provision for notifying the interested
party (e.g., the victim) when personal or confidential information is subpoenaed from a third party.
A recent federal case illustrates the problem under the current rules. 240 In an assault case, defense counsel used Federal Rule
of Criminal Procedure 17(c) to obtain a subpoena for the victim's medical records held by the Veterans Administration. 241
The federal district judge approved the subpoena and issued an order, ex parte and under seal, directing the VA to provide
defense counsel with [*905] the records. 242 Defense counsel then obtained the records, all without knowledge of the
prosecutor or the victim. 243 These records included extraordinarily intimate information about the victim, including sensitive
medical conditions, medications, psychiatric counseling, and the like. 244 The matter came to the prosecutor's attention - and,
thus, the victim's attention - only because defense counsel warned the prosecutor, while attempting to negotiate a favorable
plea, that taking the case to trial would cause irreparable harm to the victim because, by the time the defense attorney got
finished with the victim, the victim would never trust a therapist again. 245 All this happened without any notice to the victim
and without any opportunity to present arguments against disclosure of this sensitive information. 246
Allowing such subpoenas to be delivered without notice to the victim violates the CVRA's provisions guaranteeing victims the
rights to be treated with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy as well as with fairness. 247 With respect to the
protection for dignity and privacy, allowing subpoenas to go directly to third-party custodians of records could provide no
protection if the custodian is disinclined to protect the victim's privacy. Subpoenas without notice to victims also raise fairness
concerns, particularly if issues implicating the right of privacy are concerned. 248
(2) Procedural Problems with the Advisory Committee Approach
To ensure protection of crime victims' rights when subpoenas for confidential information are issued, it is necessary to change
the federal rules. I proposed an amendment to guarantee notice to crime victims as well as a court determination that the
information was relevant at trial before victims' personal and confidential information could be subpoenaed. The Advisory
Committee agreed that Rule 17 needed to be amended, but it proposed more limited protections for victims. The Committee
would require court approval before any subpoena issues to a third party seeking information about a victim. However, the
court would have discretion about whether to give the victim an opportunity to be heard on the subpoena; and there are no
substantive limits on the kinds of information that defendants can subpoena.
Turning first to the procedural problems with the Advisory Committee proposal, the Committee would remit the entire issue of
whether to issue a subpoena for personal or confidential information (and, indeed, whether to even tell a victim about such a
subpoena) to the discretion of the court. The only protection the Advisory Committee offers is the requirement of a court order
[*906] approving such a subpoena. The committee gives courts discretion to notify the victim or simply issue the subpoena ex
parte.

Subpoenas issued ex parte are plainly unfair to victims. When a victim's personal or confidential information is at stake, it is
truly hard to understand how anyone could argue that allowing it to be turned over to the defense without any opportunity to be
heard treats victims fairly, as the CVRA requires.
The Advisory Committee does not clearly explain when a court should proceed ex parte and when it should follow the standard
practice of giving notice to the victim as the affected party. The only justification the Advisory Committee gives for the
extraordinary step of allowing ex parte procedures is to avoid forcing premature disclosure of defense strategy to the
government. 249 But when a victim's confidential information is at stake, some interest in concealing strategy from the
opposing party can hardly be sufficient grounds for ex parte issuance of a subpoena. As the Supreme Court has bluntly
explained, our adversary system is not a poker game in which players enjoy an absolute right always to conceal their cards
until played. 250
Allowing ex parte procedures violates basic principles of fairness. The American Bar Association raised this point quite
effectively in its comments to the Advisory Committee on Rule 17. 251 The ABA explained that Canon 3(B)(7) of the Model
Code of Judicial Conduct provides in pertinent part that [a] judge shall accord to every person who has a legal interest in the
proceedings, or that person's lawyer, the right to be heard according to law. 252 Rule 17 would allow that precept to be
violated by denying some victims a chance to heard before compromising their legal rights to confidentiality in personal and
confidential information. Similarly, the ABA noted that its Model Code of Judicial Conduct generally forbids courts from
considering ex parte communications. 253 Rule 17, of course, flies in that face of that well-established prohibition. While the
Model Code of Judicial Conduct is not binding on federal courts, its principles have generally been viewed as instructive. 254
Defense attorneys would also be treading on ethical thin ice under proposed Rule 17. The Model Rules of Professional Conduct
and the ABA Criminal Justice Standards both provide that in representing a client, a lawyer shall not … use methods of
obtaining evidence that violates the legal rights of … a [third] [*907] person. 255 When defense attorneys obtain ex parte
subpoenas for a victim's confidential information, they may very well violate the rights of the victim, such as the right to
confidentiality preserved in the doctor-patient privilege or psychotherapist privilege.
For reasons such as these, the federal rape shield rule (among other examples) properly requires defendants to always provide
notice to the court - and to the victim - before seeking to introduce evidence about a rape victim's prior sexual history. 256 The
rape shield rule does not create any exception for situations that might lead to disclosure of defense strategy. Rule 17 should
follow the same approach and insure that victims always have an opportunity to contest disclosure of their personal and
confidential information in court.
Any defense interest in withholding strategy must give way to facially neutral rules. Both my proposed amendment and the
Advisory Committee's proposed amendment apply evenhandedly to both the prosecution and the defense. Thus, the
amendments are not designed to force disclosure of defense strategy, as they may also force disclosure of prosecution strategy

if it is the prosecution who subpoenas confidential victim information. Due process is satisfied as long as the prosecution and
the defense have reciprocal rights and courts apply the Rules consistently. 257
The objectionable feature of the Advisory Committee proposal is that the subpoena could be issued without notice to a crime
victim. A narrower issue is whether certain pleadings could be filed on this question on an ex parte basis. Such ex parte filing
might be appropriate, in the sense that once the court gives notice that it is considering whether to issue a subpoena, then the
defendant, the government, or, indeed, the victim might wish to file parts of their pleadings under seal for good cause shown.
Requests for such sealing could be handled in the ordinary course of litigation - once the victim knew that such litigation was
occurring.
Even if there is some tangential defense interest in conceding strategy, the Advisory Committee proposal addresses it in the
most haphazard way. Consider the Elizabeth Smart example mentioned earlier, in which the defense sent ex parte subpoenas to
Elizabeth's school and hospital. Under the Advisory Committee's proposal, a court could still decide to approve those
subpoenas ex parte to prevent disclosure of some secret defense strategy. But once the school and the hospital received the
subpoenas, nothing would bar them from revealing the subpoenas' existence to the victim - and, indeed, the world. Thus, the
interest the Advisory Committee purports to protect (concealing defense trial strategy) would actually be [*908] protected
only when the third party, for whatever reason, chose not reveal the subpoena. In the Smart case, for instance, the school did
not reveal the defense strategy 258 because it simply handed the materials over to the defense - in possible contravention of
the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. 259 But the hospital refused to hand over Elizabeth's records and contacted the
Smart family, which ultimately led to a public outcry over the subpoenas. There is no rhyme or reason to a procedure that is
supposed to protect defense strategy but that actually turns on the happenstance of whether third parties choose to notify crime
victims or the public about subpoenas they receive.
The haphazardness of the Advisory Committee's approach becomes even clearer when one realizes that defense strategy can
be protected only where the confidential information happens to rest in the hands of a third party rather than the victim herself.
Consider, for example, a rape victim who has talked to a rape crisis counselor, who takes notes of the meeting. A defendant
might attempt to subpoena those notes from the counselor. 260 But if the counselor had previously transferred the notes back to
the rape victim, then the subpoena would have to be directed to the victim herself - and the victim could then move to quash the
subpoena. This is not some academic hypothetical, as rape counselors in Pennsylvania in the 1980s used precisely this
procedure to protect their clients against abusive defense subpoenas. 261 Moreover, rape counselors - and, indeed, most third
parties involved in maintaining the personal and confidential information of victims - will probably have very strong incentives
257
See Wardius v. Oregon, 412 U.S. 470, 475-76 (1973); United States v. Bahamonde, 445 F.3d 1225, 1229 (9th Cir. 2006); Newman v.
Hopkins, 192 F.3d 1132, 1135 (8th Cir. 1999), vacated 529 U.S. 1084 (2000); United States ex rel. Veal v. DeRobertis, 693 F.2d 642, 646-
47 (7th Cir. 1982). Indeed, such reciprocity may not even be required if significant governmental interests support its omission. See
Wardius, 412 U.S. at 476.
258
Such as it was - apparently the only reason for the subpoenas was to try and dig up some dirt on the young kidnapping victim. See

As will be discussed shortly in the next Section of this Article, such a subpoena would likely be inappropriate for substantive reasons as
well. See supra Part IV, § 3.
261
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court initially found that records held by rape counseling centers were subject to only limited protection from
defense subpoenas. See In re Pittsburgh Action Against Rape, 428 A.2d 126, 132 (Pa. 1981). The results of that unfortunate decision were
swift. Rape victims requested the return of their records from the center and, in some cases, even requested termination of the counseling
relationship. Commonwealth v. Wilson, 602 A.2d 1290, 1294 n.6 (Pa. 1992); Tera Jckowski Peterson, Comment, Distrust and Discovery: The
Impending Debacle in Discovery of Rape Victims' Counseling Records in Utah, 2001 Utah L. Rev. 695; Beth Stouder, Note, Pennsylvania
Establishes New Privilege for Communications Made to a Rape Crisis Center Counselor - In re Pittsburgh Action Against Rape, 55 Temp.
L.Q. 1124, 1146 (1982). In light of this serious problem, the Pennsylvania legislature enacted a new, absolute privilege protecting
communications to rape crisis counselors from any disclosure without the consent of the victim. See 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5945.1(b) (2000)
(upheld against constitutional attack in Wilson, 602 A.2d at 1297).

for disclosing the fact of the subpoena to the victim, because of both ethical and legal considerations. 262 Thus, the Advisory
[*909] Committee's use of ex parte procedures will only randomly protect defense strategy from disclosure.
The impossibility of truly ex parte procedures for Rule 17 subpoenas to third-parties has been recognized by several court
decisions. For example, in United States v. Urlacher, the defendant sought to use Rule 17 to subpoena financial, family, and
employment information concerning an individual believed by the defendant to be the government's main witness at trial. 263
The court declined to approve the subpoena ex parte, explaining that the custodian of the records has a Rule 17(c) motion to
quash or modify, and one cannot easily imagine that such a motion should be heard and decided in secret … and hidden from
the opposing party and the public. 264 The court went on to explain the constitutional difficulties presented by such an
approach, given that the First Amendment creates a general public right of access to court proceedings. 265
Even if there is some arguable defense interest in not disclosing strategy, that interest must be subordinated to the compelling
victim interests that are at stake. My proposal (and the Advisory Committee's) applies to third-party subpoenas directed to the
victim's personal or confidential information. Congress has commanded that victims must not only be treated with fairness,
but also with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy. 266 Protecting dignity and privacy requires a hearing when
confidential information is at stake.
The Advisory Committee Note on its proposal does obliquely deal with this issue in a way that misstates the relevant legal
landscape. The Note accompanying the proposed Rule 17 amendment states vaguely that, in exercising its discretion [about
whether to give notice of a request for a subpoena], the court should consider the relevance of the subpoenaed material to the
defense, whether giving notice would prejudice the defense, and the degree to which the subpoenaed material implicates the
privacy and dignity interests of the victim. 267 This imprecise listing of discretionary factors misstates the law. The court is
not required to consider some victim-related factors and then make a discretionary decision. The CVRA commands that
victims have the right to be treated … with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy. 268 Thus, if withholding notice to a
victim fails to respect the victim's dignity and privacy (as I believe it invariably will), then the court must give notice - end of
story. 269 The CVRA flatly directs: [*910] In any court proceedings involving an offense against a crime victim, the court
shall ensure that the crime victim is afforded the rights described [in the CVRA]. 270
The Advisory Committee Note is also an incomplete listing of the victim's rights that are implicated in decisions about issuing
subpoenas. From a procedural perspective, if the court holds a hearing on whether to issue the subpoena, the CVRA entitles a

In theory, the Advisory Committee could argue that the CVRA is unconstitutional in this respect and therefore must give way. But the
CVRA is presumed to be constitutional and the caselaw strongly supports the Act. See, e.g., Wardius v. Oregon, 412 U.S. 470, 475 (1973)
(finding no constitutional barrier to reciprocal discovery rules that act as a two-way street); cf. Forsythe v. Walters, 38 F. App'x 734, 737
(3d Cir. 2002) (finding that application of the CVRA does not exact a punishment and therefore the CVRA can not violate the Ex Post Facto
Clause).

crime victim to notice of that proceeding 271 and to an opportunity to attend that hearing, unless the victim's testimony would
clearly be materially affected from attending the hearing. 272 From a substantive perspective, subpoenas for personal or
confidential materials are often outside the scope of legitimate discovery, as will be explained in the next section. Such
subpoenas can also implicate a victim's right to be reasonably protected from the accused. 273 For example, a defense
subpoena to the Department of Motor Vehicles for address information could very directly jeopardize a victim's safety. 274 Yet
the Advisory Committee Note makes no mention of such legitimate factors - factors the CVRA requires courts to consider.
Finally, given all this, if disclosure of defense strategy somehow remains the overriding issue in handling a subpoena, there
are less-abusive means for dealing with the problem. For example, a court could give the victim notice of the subpoena but also
enter an order forbidding the prosecution from using any information it might learn as a result of this disclosure. Such an order
is far preferable to the ex parte procedure proposed by the Advisory Committee. For the above reasons, the Advisory
Committee's proposal for Rule 17 is insufficiently protective of crime victims' procedural rights. 275
(3) The Lack of a Basis for Defense Subpoenas for Confidential Information
The Advisory Committee's approach is not only procedurally flawed but also substantively flawed. In particular, the Advisory
Committee arguably expands a defendant's power to subpoena confidential material from a victim, thereby creating new rights
for defendants at the expense of victims' rights under the [*911] CVRA. This violates the Rules Enabling Act, which provides
that court-promulgated rules shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right. 276
The Advisory Committee's proposed rule would read: [A] subpoena requiring the production of personal or confidential
information about a victim may not be served on a third party without a court order, which may be granted ex parte. 277 The
clear implication of this sentence is that, with a court order, a subpoena can be served on a third party requiring production of
personal or confidential information. Nothing in the proposed rules (or the Advisory Committee Notes) appears to require any
further showing before the subpoena would issue. This seems to give defendants unrestrained subpoena power over
confidential information. If this implication is correct, then the Advisory Committee has, remarkably, taken a law designed to
provide more protection for victims and used it to create less in clear contravention of the CVRA and the Rules Enabling Act.
The governing law on subpoenas comes from United States v. Nixon, which interpreted Rule 17 to require a subpoenaing party
to show relevancy, admissibility, and specificity of any information sought. 278 In particular, for a subpoena to issue before
trial, Nixon requires the moving party to show:
(1) that the documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by
exercise of due diligence; (3) that the party cannot properly prepare for trial without such production and inspection in advance

In addition, the ability to subpoena such information would directly undermine current caselaw, which grants the defendant no right to
disclosure of the names and addresses of government witnesses before trial. For further discussion, see infra notes 325-335 and
accompanying text.
275
Apparently as a partial response to these concerns, the Advisory Committee made some changes in its proposed amendment to Rule 17.

of trial and that failure to obtain such inspection may tend unreasonably to delay the trial; and (4) that the application is made in
good faith and is not intended as a general fishing expedition. 279
Because of this governing law, I proposed that Rule 17 should itself identify restrictions on a defendant's ability to subpoena
confidential information. My proposal incorporates specificity, relevancy, and admissibility components - conforming with,
rather than altering, existing law. My current proposal 280 requires the information be specifically described and admissible at
trial - and it bars evidence sought for impeachment purposes only. In contrast, the Advisory Committee seemingly enlarges the
substantive rights of defendants by failing to reference even a single Nixon factor in its proposal. Thus, unless a court takes it
upon itself to ensure the relevancy, specificity, and admissibility of the subpoenas, [*912] the Advisory Committee proposal
might provide the defendant with license to conduct the very fishing expedition that Nixon forbids.
The proposed Advisory Committee Note adds to this confusion. The Note indicates that in considering whether to issue the
subpoena, the court should consider the relevance of the subpoenaed material to the defense. 281 But this is an overly broad
formulation. The court should only consider the relevance of the material to the defense at trial, since this is the only
permissible basis for a subpoena.
Current law clearly limits Rule 17 subpoenas to evidence that is admissible at trial. 282 The reason for Nixon's limitations of
relevance, admissibility, and specificity is that subpoenas are not intended to provide a means of discovery for criminal cases
but only to expedite the trial by providing a time and place before trial for the inspection of subpoenaed materials. 283 With
regard to admissibility, Nixon explained that generally, the need for evidence to impeach witnesses is insufficient to require its
production in advance of trial. 284 In other words, documents sought for the narrow purpose of impeachment are not
evidentiary for the purposes of Rule 17. 285 In Nixon, only because the prosecutor made a sufficient preliminary showing that
the subpoenaed tapes contained evidence admissible with respect to the offenses charged in the indictment and that the
evidence could be validly used as nonimpeachment evidence, did the Court find the evidence to be subpoenable. 286
Courts apply Nixon's admissibility test strictly, rejecting, for example, subpoenas for hearsay evidence that would be
inadmissible at trial. 287 The cases have recognized that broad subpoenas run afoul of these limitations - including subpoenas
seeking information about crime victims. 288 For example, in United States v. Hang, the Eighth Circuit affirmed the district

My earlier proposal specifically required that no subpoena would issue without a finding by the court that the information is relevant to
trial. Cassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 875 (emphasis added). In view of the importance of the Nixon factors, it now seems
desirable to spell them all out, as my current proposal does.

court's refusal to issue subpoenas designed to uncover documents relating to the mental health of a victim and various
witnesses. 289 The court described the broad and speculative nature of the request directed toward a hospital, observing that the
defense was hard- [*913] pressed' to describe the information it hoped to discover in the materials. 290 Consistent with
Nixon, the court found the defendant's request exemplified his mere hope' that the desired documents would produce
favorable evidence, and a Rule 17(c) subpoena cannot properly be issued upon a mere hope.' 291 Similarly, in State v. Percy,
the Vermont Supreme Court upheld the lower court's refusal to order production by the victim. 292 The defendant had
requested production of the victim's mental health information, arguing it was necessary for him to present his defense. 293 The
Vermont Supreme Court rejected the defendant's arguments, finding that he made no showing of the materiality or helpfulness
of the information - indeed, [the] defendant essentially admitted the underlying acts. 294 The court also found it notable that
the information sought was in the hands of a third party - not the State - and that the defendant made a broad request, rather
than specifying particular records in the subpoena. 295 In aggregate, the court considered those factors fatal to the defendant's
request. 296
These cases were all decided against a constitutional backdrop that must favor crime victims: a criminal defendant has no
constitutional right to conduct discovery, while confidential and personal information of crime victims may be protected by a
constitutional right of privacy.
The Supreme Court has clearly held that there is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case. 297 Indeed,
the Constitution has little to say regarding the amount of discovery which the parties must be afforded. 298 The only
remotely related due process requirement the Court has recognized is the requirement that prosecutors disclose evidence that is
favorable to the accused and material to guilt or punishment 299 - evidence that would deprive the defendant of a fair trial if not
disclosed. 300 But even this rule - the Brady rule - is not a discovery rule and it does not reflect any discovery rights. Rather, it
is a self-executing constitutional rule - a rule of fairness and minimum prosecutorial obligation. 301 Recognizing this, the
Supreme Court has carefully circumscribed Brady: An interpretation of Brady to create a broad, constitutionally required right
of discovery would entirely alter the character and balance of our present systems of [*914] criminal justice. 302 Indeed,

Brady's requirements are incongruous with traditional discovery, as Brady does not even apply at pretrial stages. 303 Rule 16
of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure was built on this foundation. The assumption that no right to discovery exists is
still the underlying predicate for Rule 16. 304
Because there is no constitutional right to discovery, discovery is determined largely by statute and court rule. 305 Discovery
statutes typically apply to exculpatory material within the possession or control of the state. 306 For example, in the Supreme
Court case of Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, the defendant sought recorded statements made to a youth counselor concerning an
alleged assault. 307 The recorded statements were taken and possessed by Pennsylvania's Children and Youth Services, a statecreated
agency. 308 The Court concluded that due process considerations required an in camera review of the records to see
whether they might contain information material to the defense. 309 The Court explained that it is well settled that the
government has the obligation to turn over evidence in its possession that is both favorable to the accused and material to guilt
or punishment. 310 The Court cited the well-known decision of Brady v. Maryland, 311 as authority for this conclusion. 312
Ritchie and other cases relying on Brady have no relevance to the issue of subpoenas to third parties. Brady imposes a
constitutional duty on prosecutors to turn over exculpatory evidence … . 313 The rationale for such a rule is that the
prosecutor, after initiating criminal charges, should not be the architect of an unfair proceeding. 314 Plainly, crime victims
(and third parties holding records about crime victims) are not state actors. They are not architects of the criminal proceedings
and therefore are not subject to these constitutional restrictions on state action. The Seventh Circuit explained this point clearly
in United States v. [*915] Hach. 315 There, the defendant sought to compel a third-party witness to turn over her medical and
psychiatric records to the court for in camera review. 316 The witness refused to release her records, which were not held by
any government agency. 317 The government argued it was powerless to force her to accede to the demand. 318 The Seventh
Circuit agreed, holding that a failure to show that the records a defendant seeks are in the government's possession is fatal to [a
Ritchie claim]. 319 The Seventh Circuit noted that the two other opinions it could locate on the due process question had
reached precisely the same conclusion. 320 In United States v. Skorniak, the Eighth Circuit held that a defendant could not
subpoena medical records of a witness. 321 And the government is under no obligation to seek out potentially exculpatory

evidence, the court reasoned. 322 Similarly, a Maryland appellate court, in Goldsmith v. State, denied a defendant's attempt to
obtain access to a witness's psychiatric record. 323 After examining the relevant authorities, the court explained: We find no
common law, court rule, statutory or constitutional requirement that a defendant be permitted pretrial discovery of privileged
records held by a third party. 324 Thus, crime victims (and third parties holding information about crime victims) will only
rarely - if ever - have information a defendant is constitutionally entitled to examine.
Because a defendant has no constitutional right to discovery, any such claim must rest on a statute. Yet the federal statutes, if
anything, cut against broad discovery claims. The Jencks Act, 325 for example, restricts access to statements by [*916]
government witnesses. 326 It specifically mandates that only after a government witness testifies on direct examination shall
the statement of the witness be the subject of discovery. 327 The Jencks Act does not even allow access to all statements - a
witness statement need only be produced if the statement relates to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified'
not if it merely relates to the subject matter at issue in [the] case.' 328 Even then, only a substantially verbatim recital of an
oral statement made by said witness to an agent' is discoverable under the Jencks Act. 329 Although the Act was meant to
preserve defendants' right to access information that might aid in impeaching government witnesses at trial, the legislative
history expresses a much greater concern with limiting the application of the Jencks decision so that it would not hamper the
workings of law enforcement by forcing wholesale disclosure of government materials and files. 330
The Jencks Act also bars any pretrial disclosure of witness statements. Congress provided for discovery of statements only
after the witness has testified, out of concern for witness intimidation, subornation of perjury, and other threats to the integrity
of the trial process. 331 Courts have held true to this congressional determination, blocking defense efforts to obtain pretrial
discovery about government witnesses. For example, in United States v. Coppa, the Second Circuit overturned the district
court's approval of a scheduling order requiring the government to identify its witnesses in advance of trial. 332 The district
court, mindful of [the Act's] concern for witness safety, had allowed the government to file ex parte motions delaying
discovery of the witnesses' identity where such disclosure would pose a threat to the witnesses' lives or safety. 333 The Second
Circuit, however, found this protection insufficient to meet the witness-protective goals of the Jencks Act. Specifically, the

Id. at 947. The Seventh Circuit also noted that the Wisconsin Supreme Court had reached a contrary conclusion, relying on state law
grounds. Id. at 946 n.5. The Wisconsin decisions do not offer a principled reason for extending Ritchie to private records and should not be
regarded as persuasive authority here. See State v. Shiffra, 499 N.W.2d 719, 722 (Wis. Ct. App. 1993) (concluding that the issue of application
of Ritchie to private records had already been decided in State v. S.H.); State v. S.H., 465 N.W.2d 238, 241 (Wis. Ct. App. 1999) (applying
Ritchie to private records without any discussion of the issue).

(upholding decision not to compel disclosure of witness medical and psychiatric records: the government has no obligation to obtain for a

court determined this remedy does not address the Government's justifiable concerns regarding the risk of witness tampering
in circumstances where there is no evidence that the life or safety of a prospective witness is in danger. 334 In other words,
Jencks Act protection is not limited to situations where the government shows an actual danger to witnesses - its witnessprotective
qualities reach much further. 335
[*917] The lack of grounds for subpoenas seeking victim information is more evident when viewed against a legal landscape
that gives defendants no right before trial to obtain even the names of government witnesses. Current law provides no basis for
the pretrial disclosure of the names and addresses of government witnesses - including witnesses who are crime victims. For
one thing, Rule 16, which governs discovery and inspection in criminal cases, contains no provisions for such disclosure. This
omission was purposeful and mirrors the witness-protective purposes of the Jencks Act:
A majority of the Conferees [that is, congressional members determining the language of Rule 16] believe it is not in the
interest of the effective administration of criminal justice to require that the government or the defendant be forced to reveal the
names and addresses of its witnesses before trial. Discouragement of witnesses and improper contacts directed at influencing
their testimony, were deemed paramount concerns in the formulation of this policy. 336
Rule 16, therefore, along with other criminal discovery rules, does not entitle defendants to pretrial discovery of names and
addresses of prospective government witnesses or persons who have knowledge of the case. 337
By statute, capital cases are exempt from this rule. In capital cases, the accused is entitled to a copy of the indictment and a list
of juror and witness names and address - but only three days in advance of the trial. 338 And notably, the same statute
explicitly provides for the withholding of this information if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that providing
the list may jeopardize the life or safety of any person. 339 No statute authorizes similar disclosures in noncapital cases. As
the Eighth Circuit noted in United States v. Hutchings, neither [Rule 16(a)] governing information subject to disclosure by the
Government in criminal cases, nor any other federal rule or statute requires the Government to supply names of potential

witnesses to a criminal defendant in a noncapital case. 340 Many other courts have reached substantially the same conclusion.
341
[*918] A few older cases held that district courts possess authority to compel the government to disclose the identity of its
witnesses before trial. However, the basis for such grants of authority now seems defunct. For instance, in United States v.
Armstrong, the Ninth Circuit recognized no authority exists in the federal rules for requiring the government to disclose the
names of its witnesses. 342 Still, the court held that district courts have authority to require such disclosure based on Federal
Rule of Criminal Procedure 57(b). 343 This rule acts as a stopgap: in the absence of controlling law, it allows judges to
regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal law, these rules, and the local rules of the district. 344 In light of the
conference report on Rule 16, compelling disclosure of witness names before trial appears inconsistent with the federal rules.
And even if the Ninth Circuit's approach was valid at the time Armstrong was decided, such an approach is no longer valid in
light of the CVRA. Rule 57(b) only provides a basis for court authority in the absence of controlling law - since 2004, the
CVRA has controlled the treatment of victims. The CVRA clearly mandates a victim be reasonably protected from the
accused, 345 as well as treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy. 346 Disclosure of a
victim's name and address before trial is governed by these mandates, not vague gap-filling provisions.
If a defendant cannot even validly compel disclosure of a victim's name and address in advance of trial, it is nonsensical to
think a defendant could validly subpoena the same information from the Department of Motor Vehicles or the telephone
company - and it is incredible to think a defendant could use the Advisory Committee's rule to subpoena even more personal
victim information. The rules would be backward indeed if a defendant were able to subpoena a victim's confidential mental
health records in a legal system that disallows compelled disclosure of a witness's name or address. Instead, the only rational
conclusion is that because defendants have no right to witnesses' identifying information, they certainly have no right to other
sorts of victim-related discovery. Clearly, then, defendants have little constitutional or statutory heft behind an argument for
subpoenas directed at obtaining victim information.
On the other hand, victims will often have legitimate reasons for resisting such subpoenas - reasons that are protected not only
by the CVRA but also by the Constitution, under current case law, and as part of the right of privacy. 347 One aspect of this due
process privacy right is the individual interest in avoiding [*919] disclosure of personal matters 348 or, in other words, the

751 F.2d 230, 236 (8th Cir. 1984); accord United States v. House, 939 F.2d 659, 663 (8th Cir. 1991) (Criminal defendants in noncapital
cases are not entitled to pretrial disclosure of witnesses.).

My discussion of these issues draws heavily on thoughts from an extremely knowledgeable crime victims' litigator - Wendy Murphy. See

promote a compelling state interest. Id. at 607 (Brennan, J., concurring).

privacy interest in keeping personal facts away from the public eye. 349 Consider, for example, the privacy of therapeutic
counseling communications. Federal case law establishes that such communications are protected by a constitutional privacy
right 350 - a right that would be gutted if defendants were allowed to freely subpoena victims' mental health records. Moreover,
some courts and commentators suggested the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures
applies to (and may prohibit) court-mandated discovery of victims. 351
For all these reasons, a defense subpoena seeking third-party information about a crime victim rests on extraordinarily shaky
ground. The Advisory Committee must ensure that through casual drafting it does not inadvertently invite more defense
subpoenas for such information. The Advisory Committee's current draft may well have that effect, by seemingly authorizing
such subpoenas without regard to the numerous restrictions governing their use (and even allowing them to be issued ex parte).
The Committee should, instead, follow my approach by indicating very clearly that such subpoenas are only allowed where
specifically identified evidence will be obtained that is relevant to and admissible at trial, and [*920] that is otherwise
reasonable. As a weaker but still positive alternative, the Committee could include an Advisory Committee Note making this
point clear. One possible note would be as follows:
Rule 17(c)(3) is intended to provide greater procedural protection for crime victims than exists under current law. It is not
intended to expand in any way the permissible grounds for defense subpoenas. Like other trial subpoenas, a defense subpoena
seeking victim information must narrowly request only information admissible at trial and may not be used for discovery. See
United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683[, 700] (1974) (requiring subpoenaing party to clear three hurdles: (1) relevancy; (2)
admissibility; (3) specificity). A defense subpoena must also not tread on a crime victim's constitutionally-protected privacy
interests, see Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 598-99 (1977), or statutorily-protected interests to respect for privacy and dignity,
see Crime Victims' Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a) (2000 & Supp. 2006). As a result, such subpoenas will only rarely be
proper. See generally Paul G. Cassell, Treating Crime Victims Fairly: Integrating Victims into the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure, 2007 Utah L. Rev. 861. 352

Fourth Amendment protects from seizure is not necessarily entitled to protection under a right of nondisclosure originating in the Fourteenth

352
In response to my criticisms, the Advisory Committee agreed to make some changes in its proposed rule, making it much more difficult
(but not impossible) for defendants to obtain an ex parte subpoena. See infra notes 588-592 and accompanying text.

Unless a statute or these rules permit otherwise, the government must prosecute an offense in a district where the offense was
committed. The court must set the place of trial within the district with due regard for the convenience of the defendant, any
victim, and the witnesses, and the prompt administration of justice. 353
The Advisory Committee adopted this proposal verbatim. 354
[*921] Discussion:
Little needs be said about the Advisory Committee's agreement with my proposal here, other than to note that the Committee's
rationale for this change was to implement the victim's right to be treated with fairness' under the Crime Victims' Rights Act.
355 Why the Advisory Committee chose to implement the victims' fairness rights in Rule 18 - and only Rule 18 - is not
immediately clear. 356
Rule 20 - Victims' Views Considered Regarding Consensual Transfer The Proposals:
I proposed that Rule 20 be amended to allow the court to consider the victim's views in any decision to transfer a case as
follows:
Rule 20. Transfer for Plea and Sentence
(a) Consent to Transfer. A prosecution may be transferred from the district where the indictment or information is pending, or
from which a warrant on a complaint has been issued, to the district where the defendant is arrested, held, or present if:
(1) the defendant states in writing a wish to plead guilty or nolo contendere and to waive trial in the district where the
indictment, information, or complaint is pending, consents in writing to the court's disposing of the case in the transferee
district, and files the statement in the transferee district; and
(2) the United States attorneys in both districts approve the transfer in writing after consultation with any victim. If any victim
objects to the transfer, the United States attorney in the transferring district or the victim's attorney shall advise the court where
the indictment or information is pending of the victim's concerns. 357
I also proposed a similar change should be made to Rule 20(d) regarding transfer of juvenile proceedings. 358
The Advisory Committee recommended no change to Rule 20. 359
[*922] Discussion:
The Advisory Committee rejected this proposed change for the following reasons:
The CVRA does not specifically address transfer. It does give the victim a right to confer with the attorney for the government,
18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(5), but that is not the same as requiring the attorney for the government to notify the court of the victim's
views regarding transfers. Indeed, the CVRA provides that nothing in this chapter shall be construed to impair the
prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General or any officer under his direction. 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(6). Accordingly, the

CVRA contemplates that the attorney for the government will consider the victim's interests in exercising prosecutorial
discretion, including the discretionary determination whether to consent to a Rule 20 transfer. The Subcommittee was not
persuaded that the rule should disturb this statutory balance by requiring the attorney for the government to advise the court of
a victim's objection to a Rule 20 transfer. In appropriate cases, the attorney for the government should appraise the court of the
victim's view. 360
The Advisory Committee is able to claim that the CVRA does not specifically address transfer only because it reviewed an
amputated CVRA - that is, a CVRA without a right to fairness. Under an unblinkered fair reading of the CVRA, the right to
fairness applies specifically to Rule 20 transfer decisions, no less than the Rule 18 decision to set the place of prosecution just
discussed and, indeed, all other decisions in the criminal justice process. Thus, the Advisory Committee has unfairly stacked
the deck in deciding that it would not disturb this statutory balance, when it chose not to weigh the victim's right to fairness
as part of that balance.
Even under its truncated view of the statute, the Advisory Committee does envision that the prosecutors will confer with
victims about Rule 20 transfer decisions. But the Committee did not want to require prosecutors to notify courts of a victim's
objection, venturing only that in appropriate cases, the attorney for the government should appraise the court of the victim's
views. 361 The Committee is coy on the question of when it would not be appropriate for the prosecutor to fail to notify a
court of the victim's views. Whenever an unrepresented crime victim objects to transferring a case, prosecutors, as officers of
the court, have a duty to pass that objection along to the court as relevant [*923] information bearing on the transfer decision.
362 The rule should state that fact directly.
Finally, nothing in my proposal would impair prosecutorial discretion. My proposal deals solely with ensuring that victim
information is passed along to the judge who must approve a transfer decision. The government remains entirely free to make
whatever decision it wants on the issue and argue whatever position it believes is appropriate. Moreover, the CVRA itself
envisions that the government may have obligations to assert victims' rights. For starters, the CVRA requires prosecutors to
make their best efforts to see that victims are accorded their rights. 363 In addition, the CVRA gives prosecutors the ability
to assert victims' rights. 364 This provision was designed to ensure that victims' rights are not inadvertently lost because a
victim lacks legal counsel. As Senator Kyl explained, This provision also recognizes that, at times, the government's attorney
may be best situated to assert a crime victim's rights … because the crime victim is not available at a particular point in the trial
… . 365 In light of its obligations to accord victims their rights and to enforce those rights, the government should at least
inform the court when a victim has concerns about a transfer.
Rule 21 - Victims' Views Considered Regarding Transfer for Prejudice The Proposals:
I proposed that Rule 21 be amended to require consideration of the victim's interest in whether a case should be transferred as
follows:
(e) Victims' Views. The court shall not transfer any proceeding without giving any victim an opportunity to be heard. The court
shall consider the views of the victim in making any transfer decision. 366

The Advisory Committee recommended no change to this rule. 367
Discussion:
The Advisory Committee rejected this change because, in its view, the fact that the CVRA did not specifically address transfer
decisions precluded any amendment:
[*924]
Judge Cassell grounds his proposal on the general provision of the CVRA that gives a victim a right to be treated with
fairness. 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(8). The Subcommittee was not persuaded that this general language warranted an amendment
that would require the court to consider the victim's views. In the case of transfers for prejudice, the preferences of the victim
could not outweigh the defendant's right to a fair proceeding. In the case of transfers for convenience, the statutory right to
confer with the attorney for the government provides the mechanism for incorporating the victim's views. As in the case of
Rule 20, the Subcommittee declined to go beyond the carefully crafted limitations of the statute. In appropriate cases, the
attorney for the government should appraise the court of the victim's views. 368
Once again, the Advisory Committee's position clashes with the statute. The Committee does not argue (nor does it seem
plausible to argue) that transferring a case to a distant location without even considering the victim's view treats the victim
fairly. Instead, the Committee ducks the implications of the right to fairness because it is general language, as though a
general command from Congress can be ignored.
Perhaps recognizing the weakness of its position, the Advisory Committee goes on to craft a policy argument against victims
being heard. It divides transfer cases into two types - those for convenience and those for prejudice - and concludes that victims
should not enjoy a guaranteed right to be heard in either situation. In neither case is the analysis convincing.
With regard to transfers for convenience, the Committee contends that the victim's right to confer with prosecutors is sufficient
protection. But a victim's conference with those very same government authorities who find it convenient to move the case
hardly will give victims much comfort - much less the right to fairness that Congress has mandated. The Committee also is less
than clear when it directs prosecutors to advise the court of the victim's objections in appropriate cases. It is hard to think of
any case when a prosecutor would be justified in concealing an unrepresented victim's concerns from the court. 369 It is far
simpler - and, more to the point, simply fair - to ensure that the court will always consider a victim's views on transfer.
With regard to transfers to avoid prejudice, the Advisory Committee concludes that a victim's views could not outweigh the
defendant's right to a fair proceeding. But no one argues that victims' views will necessarily outweigh a defendant's argument;
the limited point is simply that victims' views should be considered in the balance. Moreover, a victim may be able to
demonstrate that a defendant's argument is unsupported or that other, less burdensome alternatives to [*925] transferring a
case exist. Surely these are sufficiently important reasons to let a victim be heard before a case is moved.
The Advisory Committee also appears to overlook the constitutional grounding that a victim's opposition to a transfer decision
enjoys. In contrast to the Sixth Amendment, which gives defendants in a state prosecution a right to trial in their home state,
370 Article III simply commands that in a federal prosecution, the Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall
be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes have been committed. 371 This Article III vicinage
right was designed to protect not only the rights of the defendant but also the rights of the community - including victims in the

community. 372 The provision is designed to secure a trial within the same political community (the state) in which the
victim would likely reside. 373
The Supreme Court's decisions on right of public access to trials bolsters the understanding of the Article II's provision to
protect the community interest. In cases such as Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, the Court has held that implicit in the
First Amendment is a guarantee of the public's right to attend trials. 374 Compelling victims' interests underlie this guarantee.
As the Court has explained, public proceedings vindicate the concerns of the victims and the community in knowing that
offenders are being brought to account for their criminal conduct. 375 And as Justice Blackmun has emphasized, The victim
of the crime, the family of the victim, [and] others who have suffered similarly, … . have an interest in observing the course of
a prosecution. 376 Victims are vitally interested in observing criminal trials because society has withdrawn both from the
victim and the vigilante the enforcement of criminal laws, but [it] cannot erase from people's consciousness the fundamental,
natural yearning to see justice done - or even the urge for retribution. 377
For purposes of this Article, it is not necessary to definitively trace how victims' constitutional interests play out against a
defendant's right to avoid a prejudicial trial. The very limited point here is merely that victims should be heard on any transfer,
so that a judge can make a fully informed decision. Even if the judge determines to transfer a case, the victim may have
valuable information for the judge on where to transfer the case (for example, to an adjacent district or state [*926] rather than
a distant one) or how to impanel an unbiased jury (for example, importing a jury rather than exporting the trial). 378
An illustration of the general approach of the proposed rule comes from the leading case of State v. Timmendequas, 379
decided by the New Jersey Supreme Court. In Timmendequas, the trial judge imported a jury from a distant community to hear
a capital case rather than forcing the family of a murdered young girl to travel to another district. 380 Construing New Jersey
state law provisions similar to the CVRA's, the New Jersey Supreme Court explained that the trial judge properly considered
the views of the victim's family:
Over the past decade, both nationwide and in New Jersey, a significant amount of legislation has been passed implementing
increased levels of protection for victims of crime. Specifically, in New Jersey, the Legislature enacted the Crime Victim's Bill
of Rights. That amendment marked the culmination of the Legislature's efforts to increase the participation of crime victims in
the criminal justice system.
The purpose of the Victim's Rights Amendment was to enhance and protect the necessary role of crime victims and witnesses
in the criminal justice process. In furtherance of [that goal], the improved treatment of these persons should be assured through
the establishment of specific rights. One of the enumerated rights guaranteed for victims is to have inconveniences associated
with participation in the criminal justice process minimized to the fullest extent possible.

… . The [trial] court explicitly stated that it was not favoring the rights of the victims over those of defendant. Rather, it was
simply taking their concerns into consideration, as it had not done previously. Taking the concerns of the victim's family into
account does not constitute error, provided that the constitutional rights of the defendant are not denied or infringed on by that
decision. 381
Timmendequas demonstrates that victims can have legitimate interests in transfer decisions that can be accommodated without
violating defendants' rights. Rule 21 ought to be amended to allow victims to provide that kind of information to the judge
before any transfer decision is made. 382
[*927] Rule 23 - Victims' Views Considered Regarding Nonjury Trial The Proposals:
I proposed that the court should be required to consider the views of victims before allowing waiver of a jury trial as follows:
Rule 23. Jury or Nonjury Trial
(a) Jury Trial. If the defendant is entitled to a jury trial, the trial must be by jury unless:
(1) the defendant waives a jury trial in writing;
(2) the government consents; and
(3) the court approves after considering the views of any victims. 383
The Advisory Committee did not recommend any change to this rule. 384
Discussion:
Here again, the Advisory Committee declined to adopt my recommendation because it goes beyond the specific provisions of
the CVRA, which do not address the issues whether the trial should be to the court or to a jury. 385 It is not necessary to repeat
the arguments about the victim's right to fairness here, other than to note that the preferred trial method in the federal courts is
a jury trial. 386 Why it is fair to deviate from that preferred method without first listening to the victims is not immediately
clear.
But, for the sake of argument, assume that nothing in the CVRA requires the Advisory Committee to change this rule. The fact
remains that the Advisory Committee could still change the rule if there were good reasons to do so. In view of this fact, it is
surprising that the Committee never defends the logic behind allowing a court to dispense with a jury trial without even hearing
from a victim. To help protect the general public interest in trial by jury, Rule 23 currently requires not only prosecutor

approval, 387 but also court approval. 388 Any approval [*928] requires careful weighing of the competing concerns. The
Supreme Court has instructed that
the duty of the trial court … [in considering whether to approve a jury trial waiver] is not to be discharged as a mere matter of
rote, but with sound and advised discretion, with an eye to avoid unreasonable or undue departures from that mode of trial or
from any of the essential elements thereof, and with a caution increasing in degree as the offenses dealt with increase in gravity.
389
This is a serious and weighty responsibility. 390
To discharge that serious and weighty responsibility, the Advisory Committee should draft Rule 23 so that the trial court should
receive as much relevant information as possible. The victim may be well situated to provide useful information about how the
public will view a nonjury trial. The proposed rule change takes the modest step of allowing the victim to be heard before the
court approves any nonjury trial.
(New) Rules 32(e), (f), (h), and (i) - Disclosure of the Presentence Report to Victims and Opportunity for Victims to Object and
Be Heard 391 The Proposals:
In the federal system, the presentence report is a critical part of the sentencing process. I therefore recommended that the
prosecutor should be required to disclose relevant parts of the presentence report to victims as follows:
[*929]
(e) Disclosing the Report and Recommendation.
(1) Time to Disclose. Unless the defendant has consented in writing, the probation officer must not submit a presentence report
to the court or disclose its contents to anyone until the defendant has pleaded guilty or nolo contendere, or has been found
guilty.
(2) Minimum Required Notice. The probation officer must give the presentence report to the defendant, the defendant's
attorney, and an attorney for the government at least 35 days before sentencing unless the defendant waives this minimum
period. The attorney for the government shall, if any victim requests, communicate the relevant contents of the presentence
report to the victim.

391
In addition to the changes to Rule 32 discussed here, the Advisory Committee essentially adopted verbatim my proposals to amend Rules
32(a), 32(c)(1)(B), and 32(d)(2)(B). Compare Cassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 886, 887, 891, with Proposed Amendments,
supra note 71, R. 32(a), 32(c)(1)(B), 32(d)(2)(B), at 10-15. There is, accordingly, no need to discuss those proposed rules here.
The Advisory Committee also declined to add my proposal that the probation officer determine whether the victim wished to have any
material included in the presentence report. See Cassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 889. I will rely on my original article to
make the case for this particular change. See id. at 889-91

Page 49 of 78
(3) Sentence Recommendation. By local rule or by order in a case, the court may direct the probation officer not to disclose to
anyone other than the court the officer's recommendation on the sentence. 392
I further recommended that victims be given the opportunity to object to and be heard on disputed issues in the presentence
report as follows:
(f) Objecting to the Report.
(1) Time to Object. Within 14 days after receiving the presentence report, the parties must state in writing any objections,
including objections to material information, sentencing guideline ranges, and policy statements contained in or omitted from
the report. The attorney for the government or for the victim shall raise for the victim any reasonable objection by the victim to
the presentence report.
(2) Serving Objections. An objecting party must provide a copy of its objections to the opposing party and to the probation
officer.
(3) Action on Objections. After receiving objections, the probation officer may meet with the parties and the victim to discuss
the objections. The probation officer may then investigate further and revise the presentence report as appropriate.
… .
(h) Notice of Intent to Consider Other Sentencing Factors. 393 Before the court may rely on a ground not identified either in the
[*930] presentence report or in a party's prehearing submission or in a victim impact statement, the court must give the parties
reasonable notice that it is contemplating either departing from the applicable guideline range or imposing a non-guideline
sentence. The notice must specify any ground not earlier identified on which the court is contemplating a departure or a nonguideline
sentence. The attorney for the government or for the victim shall advise defense counsel and the court of any ground
identified by the victim that might reasonably serve as a basis for departure.
(i) Sentencing.
(1) In General. At sentencing, the court:
(A) must verify that the defendant and the defendant's attorney have read and discussed the presentence report and any
addendum to the report;
(B) must give to the defendant and an attorney for the government a written summary of - or summarize in camera - any
information excluded from the presentence report under Rule 32(d)(3) on which the court will rely in sentencing, and give them
a reasonable opportunity to comment on that information;
(C) must allow the parties' attorneys and any victims to comment on the probation officer's determinations and other matters
relating to an appropriate sentence; and
(D) may, for good cause, allow a party or any victim to make a new objection at any time before sentence is imposed.
(2) Introducing Evidence; Producing a Statement. The court may permit the parties or the victim to introduce evidence on the
objections. If a witness testifies at sentencing, Rule 26.2(a)-(d) and (f) applies. If a party fails to comply with a Rule 26.2 order
to produce a witness's statement, the court must not consider that witness's testimony.
(3) Court Determinations. At sentencing, the court:
(A) may accept any undisputed portion of the presentence report as a finding of fact;
392

393
This rule was amended in December 2006, after my earlier article was published, to change departure language to conform with the
new, post-Booker regime. I have accordingly changed the language quoted in the text above to conform to the current language.

(B) must - for any disputed portion of the presentence report or other controverted matter - rule on the dispute or determine that
a ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not affect sentencing, or because the court will not consider the matter in
sentencing; and
[*931] (C) must append a copy of the court's determinations under this rule to any copy of the presentence report made
available to the Bureau of Prisons. 394
The Advisory Committee recommended no changes to these rules. 395
Discussion:
The CVRA entitles victims to be heard on disputed Federal Sentencing Guidelines (Guidelines) issues and, as a consequence,
to review parts of the presentence report relevant to those issues. The CVRA gives victims the right to be reasonably heard at
any public proceeding in the district court involving … sentencing. 396 The CVRA provision (among other things) codifies
the right of crime victims to give in court what is known as a victim impact statement. 397
The victim's right to be heard, however, is not narrowly circumscribed to just impact information. To the contrary, the right
conferred is a broad one - to be reasonably heard at the sentencing proceeding. The victim's right to be reasonably heard
implicitly includes a right for the victim to speak to disputed Guidelines issues. As Senator Kyl explained, the victim's right
includes the right to make sentencing recommendations:
When a victim invokes this right during … sentencing proceedings, it is intended that he or she be allowed to provide all three
types of victim impact: the character of the victim, the impact of the crime on the victim, the victim's family and the
community, and sentencing recommendations. 398
A sentencing recommendation will often directly implicate Guidelines issues, particularly where a court gives significant
weight to the Guidelines calculation (as most currently do). 399 For example, if the victim wishes to recommend a sixty-month
sentence when the maximum guideline range is only thirty months, that sentencing recommendation may be meaningless
unless a [*932] victim can provide a basis for recalculating the Guidelines or departing or varying 400 from the Guidelines.
Congress intended the victim's right to be heard to be construed broadly, as Senator Feinstein stated: The victim of crime, or
their counsel, should be able to provide any information, as well as their opinion, directly to the court concerning the …
sentencing of the accused. 401 Again, it is hard to see how victims can meaningfully provide any information that would
have a bearing on the sentence without being informed of the Guidelines calculations that likely will drive the sentence.

In addition, an independent basis for victims reviewing presentence reports is the victim's broad right under the CVRA to be
treated with fairness 402 and right to restitution, as I argued in my earlier article. 403
Thus, the CVRA should be understood as giving victims the right to relevant information in the presentence report about the
Guidelines and to be heard before a court makes any final conclusions about Guidelines calculations and other sentencing
matters. Many states follow a similar approach and give victims access to presentence reports as part of the victim-impact
process. 404
Since I made my proposal, the Ninth Circuit has considered the question of whether to reverse a district court that declined to
provide the entire presentence report to a fraud victim. In an opinion containing only one substantive paragraph, the Ninth
Circuit affirmed the district court, which had rejected a victim's argument that the CVRA confers a general right for crime
victims to obtain [*933] disclosure of the [presentence report]. 405 The Ninth Circuit stated tersely that the district court did
not commit legal error. 406
Although strong arguments can be made against Kenna, 407 the case is not on point to my proposal. First, Kenna involved a
claim of a general right to access to the presentence report, apparently untethered to any particular need for access. My
amendment would be limited to situations where victims seek relevant contents of the presentence report to make a victim
impact statement at sentencing. Second, the victim in Kenna sought the entire presentence report. The Ninth Circuit pointedly
observed: We note that Kenna refused the district court's offer to consider disclosure of specific portions of the [presentence
report]. 408 My proposal tracks what the district court offered to Kenna - that a victim would have access to relevant contents
of the presentence report.
Because victims have a right of access to relevant parts of the presentence report, the question then arises of how to provide
that access. In my earlier article, I recommended the simplest solution to the competing concerns would be to disclose the
report, upon request, to victims through the prosecutor. The prosecutor could filter out irrelevant confidential information and
assist the victim by highlighting critical parts of the report. It might be objected that this approach would burden prosecutors.

But the CVRA already gives victims the right to confer with prosecutors 409 - and presumably they will be conferring
regarding the important topic of sentencing. It is important to emphasize that my proposal would require prosecutors to give all
relevant information to the victim; in other words, prosecutors would serve as a conduit to the victim, but not a controller of the
victim.
The Advisory Committee declined to adopt my proposal, opining that the prosecutor should remain the victim's source of
information regarding the sentencing process and the contents of the presentence report, and the prosecutor should have
discretion to determine what information from the presentence report should be imparted to the victim. 410 This reasoning
clashes directly with the CVRA's guiding principle: that victims deserve their own rights in the criminal process. Congress
wanted victims to become participants with rights independent of the government or the defendant … . 411 For this reason,
the CVRA allows the [*934] victim to assert rights independently of the government. 412 Senator Kyl explained the victim's
right to independent action directly: [There is no authority for] the government's attorney … to compromise or co-opt a
victim's right… . The rights provided in this bill are personal to the individual crime victim and it is that crime victim that has
the final word regarding which of the specific rights to assert and when. 413
One of the victim's independent rights includes the opportunity to make sentencing recommendations. 414 Congress's
command that victims be independent participants cannot be faithfully implemented if prosecutors control the information
victims receive. If allowed to do so, prosecutors could simply feed the victim information supporting the government's view,
while withholding information undercutting it. 415 Nothing in the CVRA provides any support for this approach. 416
The Advisory Committee was also concerned that presentence reports are typically treated as confidential, because they
include a great deal of personal information about the defendant … . 417 But this concern was easily handled by my
requirement that prosecutors pass along only relevant contents of the presentence reports. Personal information only
tangentially connected to sentencing issues would not be disclosed. And if personal information about the defendant were
directly connected to sentencing issues, then fairness entitles the victim to that information to formulate a sentencing
recommendation. After all, by the time of sentencing, the defendant has been found guilty, beyond a reasonable doubt, of
harming a victim. By committing a crime against the victim, the defendant has certainly forfeited some privacy interests -
including the chance to keep from the victim information relevant to sentencing. It is also important to recall that this
information is not truly confidential in the sense that no one else [*935] will see it. It has already been disclosed to the
probation officer, defense counsel, the prosecutor, and the judge.

The Advisory Committee's view that prosecutors should control what information the victim receives is so fundamentally at odds with the
animating principles of the CVRA that it makes one wonder where it came from. Interestingly the view seems to have originated in a small
subcommittee with a representative from the Justice Department but no crime victims rights representative. See CVRA Subcommittee Memo,
supra note 66, at 1 (noting that Deborah Rhodes, Counselor to the Asst. Atty. Gen. of the Criminal Division, served on the subcommittee
drafting this language).

chapter shall be construed to impair the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General or any officer under his direction. CVRA

victims does not impair the government's decision of whether and how to prosecute a defendant. See supra notes 363-365 and accompanying
text (discussing impairment issue under Rule 20).

Once the victim receives relevant information from a presentence report, the victim no less than other participants at sentencing
should be entitled to be heard on any disputed issues. For example, in a fraud case, if the defendant claims to have swindled
only $ 5,000 and the government claims the loss is $ 10,000, the victim should be entitled to press her argument that the loss
was $ 40,000. To do otherwise, is to deprive the victim of an opportunity to participate in the sentencing process and to turn the
victim impact statement into a meaningless charade.
The Advisory Committee's view on this point is curious. The Advisory Committee did not directly quarrel with the position
that victims should have the opportunity to be heard on disputed sentencing issues. Instead, the Advisory Committee would
only go so far as to suggest that it
felt it would be desirable for the courts gradually to flesh out what the right to be heard means in this [sentencing] context
(determining, for example, when the right to be heard would include the right to introduce evidence). It is by no means clear
that the CVRA contemplates that victims will be entitled to access all of the particulars of the presentence report and be entitled
to litigate issues concerning the application of various guidelines, etc. 418
This view is objectionable on many levels. First, given the congressional purpose of fundamentally changing the way crime
victims are treated in the criminal justice process, it can hardly be desirable for courts to gradually determine what rights
victims have. As Senator Kyl explained, A central reason for these rights is to force a change in a criminal justice culture
which has failed to focus on the legitimate interests of crime victims. 419 The CVRA was meant to correct, not continue, the
legacy of the poor treatment of crime victims in the criminal process. 420
Second, the Committee diffidently opines that it is by no means clear that victims have the right to litigate disputed issues.
421 I will turn to the substance of that claim shortly. But even assuming it to be true, a fundamental purpose of the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure is to provide clarity on issues that would otherwise have to be litigated. 422 The Advisory
Committee could be clear that victims can litigate by simply putting in place my proposed rule. To do otherwise [*936] is,
unfortunately, to invite continued uncertainty over a point of vital importance to crime victims.
Finally, perhaps the reason that the Advisory Committee would venture only that it is unclear whether victims have the right to
dispute sentencing issues was a reluctance to stake out the contrary position. To maintain that victims cannot dispute sentencing
issues would collide with both statutes and common sense. As for statutory requirements, it is hard to understand how victims
will be reasonably heard at sentencing (as the CVRA commands) if they cannot contest the factors that may well drive a
sentence - the Guidelines calculations. Moreover, Congress has already directly mandated that victims will have the
opportunity to dispute sentencing factors when they relate to restitution. 423 Thus, if the Advisory Committee really wanted to
stake out a victims-can't-litigate-at-sentencing position, it would have to awkwardly carve out a restitution exception. Finally, a
victim is simply not treated with fairness if she is entirely excluded from the Guidelines process. The Supreme Court has
explained that it is … fundamental that the right to … an opportunity to be heard must be granted at a meaningful time and in
a meaningful manner.' 424 It is not meaningful for victims to make sentencing recommendations without the benefit of
knowing what everyone else in that courtroom knows - what the recommended Guidelines range is. Yet Congress plainly

intended to pass a law establishing fair play for crime victims, meaningful participation of crime victims in the justice system,
protection against a government that would take from a crime victim the dignity of due process … . 425
By building victims into the Guidelines process, my proposal would also provide an important procedural protection to
defendants. My proposed amendment to Rule 32(f) would require that the victim's attorney or the prosecutor would raise any
reasonable objection to the presentence report before the sentencing hearing, so that it could be discussed at a presentence
conference and then presented in an organized fashion to the sentencing judge. I would also require either the victim's attorney
or the prosecutor to give notice to defense counsel and the court where an upward departure argument might rest on any
information provided by the victim. 426 Setting up the procedures in this way creates an orderly process for victim objections
to affect sentencing - with fair notice to the defense. Otherwise, the court - and the defendant - might hear for the first time at
sentencing that the prosecution was considering an upward departure based on information in the victim impact statement.
[*937] The courts of appeals have split on the need for advance notice of an upward departure based on victim impact
statements. In United States v. Dozier, the Tenth Circuit held that a district court is required to give notice to a defendant before
departing upward from the advisory guideline range based on victim impact statements. 427 The breadth of that holding may be
limited, however, by unusual facts: the presentence report did not identify victim impact information as a possible basis for an
upward departure and the government conceded that a sentencing remand was appropriate. The Third Circuit has expressly
declined to follow Dozier. In United States v. Vampire Nation, 428 the Third Circuit held that, in light of the Supreme Court's
decisions making the Guidelines advisory, 429 a defendant is always on notice that a judge might find a sentencing factor
calling for a sentence higher than that advised by the Guidelines. 430 With respect to victim impact statements, the Third
Circuit highlighted the fact that victim impact statements at the sentencing hearing might provide a new, previously
undisclosed ground for an upward (or downward) departure:
The right of victims to be heard is guaranteed by the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) … . The right is in the nature of an
independent right of allocution at sentencing. See 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(4) (affording victims a right to be reasonably heard at
any public proceeding in the district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any parole proceeding). Under the CVRA,
courts may not limit victims to a written statement. See Kenna v. United States District Court, 435 F.3d 1011, 1017 (9th Cir.
2006) (Kozinski, J.) (Limiting victims to written impact statements, while allowing the prosecutor and the defendant the
opportunity to address the court, would treat victims as secondary participants in the sentencing process. The CVRA clearly
meant to make victims full participants.). Given that it would be impossible to predict what statements victims might offer at
sentencing, it would be unworkable to require district courts to provide advance notice of their intent to vary their discretionary
sentence based on victim statements that had not yet been made. 431
The contrasting positions of the Tenth and Third Circuits is part of a larger disagreement between the circuits on the extent to
which the notice requirements in the criminal rules continue to operate under the now-advisory Guidelines regime. 432

Focusing specifically on the issue of victim impact information, the [*938] Third Circuit is correct that, under the current
rules, it is unworkable to provide advance notice of upward (or downward 433 ) departures based on victim allocution at the
sentencing hearing. Under my proposal, however, victims would be integrated into the presentence process for determining
Guidelines issues, thereby ensuring that the defense has fair notice of any upward departure and the government has fair notice
of any downward departure. Regardless of whether the Guidelines are advisory, this is the fairest way to proceed for
defendants, the prosecution, and victims.
(New) Rule 32(i)(4) - Victims' Right to be Reasonably Heard at Sentencing The Proposals:
Even before passage of the CVRA, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure gave victims of crimes of violence or sexual abuse
the right to be heard at sentencing. After the CVRA extended such rights to all victims, I proposed simply striking the limitation
in the rule so that it would apply to all victims as follows:
(B) By a Victim. Before imposing sentence, the court must address any victim of a the crime of violence or sexual abuse who is
present at sentencing and must permit the victim to speak or submit any information about the sentence … . 434
The Advisory Committee tracked my change of striking the crimes of violence and sexual abuse limitation; but the Committee
also substituted language from the CVRA about being reasonably heard as follows:
(B) By a Victim. Before imposing sentence, the court must address any victim of a the crime of violence or sexual abuse who is
present at sentencing and must permit the victim to speak or submit any information about the sentence to be reasonably heard.
435
[*939] Discussion:
My proposal retained the current language in Rule 32 allowing the victim to speak or submit any information about the
sentence; the Advisory Committee would allow the victim to be reasonably heard at sentencing - language lifted from the
CVRA.
In this area, the Advisory Committee has paradoxically used the CVRA as an occasion for possibly restricting victims' rights.
Under Rule 32(i)(4)'s current language, there is no doubt that the victim could speak at sentencing (that is, give an oral
statement). Under the proposed language, litigation could result about whether victims could be reasonably heard without
being allowed to speak (that is, be confined to purely written submissions). Indeed, during the Advisory Committee meeting on
the proposal, the Advisory Committee reporter conceded that courts would have to construe exactly what [the phrase] meant
as situations came before them. 436
It is worth reflecting for a moment on how backward the Advisory Committee's approach to this issue is. Before the CVRA's
enactment, victims of crimes of violence and sexual assault had the right under Rule 32(i) to speak at sentencing (along with
the right to submit information). When Congress enacted the CVRA, the Advisory Committee and the Judicial Conference had
(11th Cir. 2006); United States v. Vampire Nation, 451 F.3d 189, 195-98 (3d Cir. 2006); United States v. Walker, 447 F.3d 999, 1006-07
(7th Cir. 2006); United States v. Egenberger, 424 F.3d 803, 805 (8th Cir. 2005). The First Circuit has held only that the failure to provide
notice does not constitute plain error. See United States v. Mateo, No. 06-1805, 2006 WL 1195676, at 1 (1st Cir. May 5, 2006).

both approved broadening that rule to give all victims the right to speak. 437 (The Judicial Conference withdrew this proposed
rule to allow reconsideration in light of the CVRA.) The CVRA gave victims the right to be reasonably heard at sentencing.
Of course, the CVRA's obvious goal was to significantly expand the rights of crime victims. With respect to the right to speak
in particular, one of the CVRA's primary sponsors stated: this section would fail in its intent if courts determined that written,
rather than oral communication, could generally satisfy this right. 438 Yet, in the wake of all this, the Advisory Committee
now proposes a rule that does not guarantee that victims have the right to speak, leaving this to the courts to construe on a caseby-case
basis. This retreat on victims' rights truly stands the CVRA on its head.
The Advisory Committee should directly state that victims have the right to speak at sentencing, as the only courts to have
reached the issue have held. 439 For [*940] instance, in United States v. Kenna, Judge Kozinski 440 explained that the
CVRA's legislative history discloses a clear congressional intent to give crime victims the right to speak at proceedings
covered by the CVRA. 441 The court first highlighted the following statement by Senator Kyl:
It is not the intent of the term reasonably in the phrase to be reasonably heard to provide any excuse for denying a victim
the right to appear in person and directly address the court. Indeed, the very purpose of this section is to allow the victim to
appear personally and directly address the court. 442
Senator Dianne Feinstein, another primary sponsor of the bill, remarked that Senator Kyl's understanding of the bill was [her]
understanding as well. 443
In addition to these floor statements, the Kenna court cited a committee report for the proposed constitutional amendment to
protect victims' rights. The Senate Report on the amendment - an amendment that contained language nearly identical to the
language in the eventually enacted CVRA - reads that:
The victim's right is to be heard. The right to make an oral statement is conditioned on the victim's presence in the courtroom
… . Victims should always be given the power to determine the form of the statement. Simply because a decision making body,
such as the court … has a prior statement of some sort on file does not mean that the victim should not again be offered the
opportunity to make a further statement … . The Committee does not intend that the right to be heard be limited to written
statements, because the victim may wish to communicate in other appropriate ways. 444

Based on this legislative history, Kenna concluded that crime victims have the right to speak at CVRA-covered proceedings.
445 Kenna explained that this interpretation advanced the purposes of the CVRA, for the statute was enacted to [*941] make
crime victims full participants in the criminal justice system. 446 The Advisory Committee should follow that lead and
provide that victims are guaranteed a right to speak at sentencing. 447 Of course, in cases involving numerous victims (for
example, a massive fraud case), the CVRA itself allows courts to fashion a reasonable procedure to accommodate the
competing concerns. 448
Rule 44.1 - Discretionary Appointment of Counsel for Victim The Proposals:
I proposed that the court's discretionary authority to appoint counsel for a victim should be included in a new rule as follows:
Rule 44.1 Counsel for Victims.
When the interests of justice require, the court may appoint counsel for a victim to assist the victim in exercising his or her
rights. 449
The Advisory Committee did not propose any change in the Rules on this subject. 450
Discussion:
The Advisory Committee never discussed this particular proposed change, so it is possible that its failure to adopt it was an
oversight. 451 In any event, here it is perhaps useful to emphasize just a few points in favor of this proposal.
While the CVRA does not create a right to counsel for victims, nothing in the Act deprived the courts of their preexisting
inherent authority. The courts generally have the right to appoint volunteer counsel in civil cases, 452 a power that would seem
to extend to criminal cases. Indeed, the Supreme Court has left open the question of whether federal courts possess the inherent
authority to require counsel [*942] to provide legal services to the poor. 453 The local rules of some federal courts already
explicitly recognize this power. 454 In addition, Title 28 broadly permits the court in both civil and criminal cases to request
an attorney to represent any person unable to afford counsel. 455 And before Gideon v. Wainwright, 456 courts could request

that lawyers provide assistance to indigent criminal defendants. Presumably, that same power extends to requesting assistance
for crime victims. 457 In light of all these facts, federal courts have the inherent power to request attorneys to represent indigent
crime victims.
An illustration of this power is found in a decision by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina in
United States v. Stamper. 458 In this rape case, a dispute arose over the admission of certain psychiatric reports concerning the
victim that the defense alleged demonstrated a pattern of making false allegations of sexual abuse. 459 She requested
independent counsel to protect her privacy interests. 460 After consulting with the victim, the court appointed counsel for her.
461 The court then allowed her counsel to participate in hearings regarding the evidence, including cross-examination of the
relevant witnesses. 462
My proposed rule would simply confirm the existing discretionary power of the courts to appoint volunteer counsel
demonstrated in cases like Stamper. The rule is purely discretionary (the court may appoint counsel) and is limited to
situations where the interests of justice require appointment. The rule does not address payment for counsel, as this matter must
be left to subsequent appropriations from Congress. The court, however, can ask for volunteer counsel to assist victims pro
bono.
Finally, it might be argued that it is unnecessary to address this subject in a rule because the court's inherent authority to
appoint counsel exists even without a rule. Both courts and victims, however, will find it useful to have this authority close at
hand in the criminal rules. Rule 44 already covers the subject of appointing counsel for defendants in great detail, so adding a
Rule 44.1 addressing victims' counsel is a natural corollary. In addition, prosecutors are obligated by the CVRA to advise the
crime victim that the crime victim can seek advice of an attorney with respect to the rights described in subsection (a). 463
This may frequently [*943] require prosecutors to help victims obtain legal counsel. Accordingly, a separate rule on this
subject is appropriate. For all these reasons, the Rules should be amended to recognize the court's authority to appoint volunteer
counsel to represent a crime victim.
Rule 46 - Victims' Right to Be Heard Regarding Defendant's Release from Custody The Proposal:
I proposed that a victim should be given the right to offer views regarding the defendant's release from custody and that the
court should consider those views as follows:
(k) Victims' Right to Be Heard. A victim has the right to be heard regarding any decision to release the defendant. The court
shall consider the views of victims in making any release decision, including such decisions in petty cases. In a case where the
court finds that the number of victims makes it impracticable to accord all of the victims the right to be heard in open court, the
court shall fashion a reasonable procedure to facilitate hearing from representative victims. 464
The Advisory Committee proposed no change to this rule. 465 It did, however, propose a global rule that would give victims a
right to be heard at proceedings involving release:

Rule 60. Victims
(a) Rights of Victims.
. . . .
(3) Right to Be Heard.
The court must permit a victim to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court concerning release . . .
involving the crime. 466
Discussion:
The Advisory Committee's global proposal gives victims the right to be heard on release decisions; but it fails to spell out
what effect, if any, the [*944] victim's statement would have after the court heard the victim. In other words, the Advisory
Committee proposal seemingly codifies an empty gesture.
In contrast, my proposal would take the straightforward and important step of requiring a court to consider the views of the
victim in determining any release decision. 467 That requirement is added directly into the rule governing release decisions -
Rule 46. Adding a specific rule with specific consequences is far preferable to the Advisory Committee's approach and is
consistent with the CVRA's goal of ensuring reasonable conditions of pre-trial and post-conviction relief that include
protections for the victim's safety. 468
Rule 48 - Victims' Views on Dismissal to be Considered The Proposals:
I proposed that the court should be required to consider the views of victims in deciding whether to grant a government's
motion to dismiss a case as follows:
Rule 48. Dismissal
(a) By the Government. The government may, with leave of court, dismiss an indictment, information, or complaint. The
government may not dismiss the prosecution during trial without the defendant's consent. In deciding whether to grant the
government's motion to dismiss, the court shall consider the views of any victims. 469
The Advisory Committee proposed no change to this rule. 470
Discussion:
The Advisory Committee declined to adopt this recommendation for several reasons:
The Subcommittee recognized that victims will have a great interest in whether charges are dismissed. The CVRA does not,
however, explicitly address dismissals, and it speaks only of not excluding the [victim] from, and providing the [victim with]
… a right to be reasonably heard at public proceedings in the district court. If the government moves for dismissal there is
ordinarily no public proceeding. (When there is a [*945] public proceeding, the victim's right not to be excluded, and to be
reasonably heard is provided for in Rule [60].)
466

Existing law has places where a victim's views could profitably be brought to bear. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 3142(c) (court to consider
whether release of the defendant will endanger the safety of any other person).

Page 60 of 78
In light of the statutory statement in 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(6) that nothing in the CVRA shall be construed to impair the
prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General, as well as the separation of powers issues raised by judicial review of the
government's decision to terminate a prosecution, the Subcommittee was not persuaded that the rule should be amended to
require the court to consider the victim's views on dismissal. When there is no public court proceeding, the victim's views will
be taken into account through the right to confer with the government under 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(5). 471
The Advisory Committee's opening premise is clear enough - victims do indeed have great interest in whether charges are
dismissed. But after this promising start, the Committee's logic is hard to track. The Advisory Committee seems to be of the
view that, in situations where a court considers a motion to dismiss at a public proceeding, the victim would be heard. 472 Yet
the proposed Rule the Committee cites for this proposition - proposed Rule 60 473 - is actually drafted so narrowly that the
victim would have no right to be heard on such a motion. 474
In situations where the court considered a motion to dismiss without a public proceeding, the Advisory Committee takes the
view that the CVRA does not explicitly address the subject. This view assumes, of course, that the victim's right to fairness
does not come into play when the prosecution moves to drop previously filed charges. This assumption is incorrect. Rule 48
already requires leave of court for a dismissal. In determining whether to grant leave, current case law requires the court to
consider whether dismissal is clearly contrary to manifest public interest. 475 The existing caselaw requires that the impact
on a victim be considered in addressing a motion to dismiss. A dismissal is clearly contrary to the public interest if the
prosecutor appears to be motivated by animus toward the victim. 476 Under the command of the CVRA, the victim thus must
be treated with fairness when the dismissal motion is addressed, as my proposal provides.
[*946] When the government files a motion to dismiss criminal charges involving a specific victim, the only way to protect
that victim's right to be treated fairly is to consider the victim's views on the dismissal. 477 To treat a person with fairness is
conventionally understood as treating them justly and equitably. 478 A victim is not treated justly and equitably if her
views are never before the court.
The Advisory Committee also alludes vaguely to separation of powers issues raised by judicial review of the government's
decision to terminate a prosecution. Here the Advisory Committee may be stepping out of line and questioning the Supreme
Court. In 1944, the Court itself added the requirement to Rule 48 that prosecutors obtain leave of court before dismissing any
indictment. 479 Thus, if there are separation of powers issues about judicial review of dismissals, they have existed for more
than half a century by virtue of specific Supreme Court action.

The Advisory Committee's next argument is that to allow victims to be heard on dismissals would violate the CVRA's
requirement that nothing in the Act shall be construed to impair the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General. 480 But
it is hard to understand how allowing information from a victim to go to a court impairs the government's discretion.
Particularly given that courts must already review the public interest in reviewing dismissal motions, executive branch power is
not impaired when a court hears from a victim in making its determination whether to approve. 481
The Advisory Committee's final argument is that when there is no public court proceeding, the victim's views will be taken
into account through the right to confer with the government … . 482 The passive voice (taken into account) obscures the
overarching fact that it is the government itself that is proposing to dismiss the charges. The victim deserves to be heard not
merely by the government agency proposing to drop the charges, but by the independent branch of government - the judiciary -
that will review that proposal. For all these reasons, Rule 48 should be amended to ensure that victims are heard because
charges are dismissed.
[*947] Rule 50 - Victims' Right to Proceedings Free From Unreasonable Delay The Proposals:
I proposed that a victim's right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay should be recognized as follows:
Rule 50. Prompt Disposition
(a) Scheduling Preference. Scheduling preference must be given to criminal proceedings as far as practicable.
(b) Defendant's Right Against Delay. The court shall assure that the defendant's right to a speedy trial is protected, as provided
by the Speedy Trial Act.
(c) Victim's Right Against Delay. The court shall assure that a victim's right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay is
protected. A victim has the right to be heard regarding any motion to continue any proceeding. If the court grants a motion to
continue over the objection of a victim, the court shall state its reasons in the record. 483
The Advisory Committee proposed no change to this Rule. 484
Discussion:
Victims have speedy trial rights under the CVRA, which grants victims the right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.
485 In addition, child victims previously had the right to a speedy trial in certain situations. 486
In view of these statutory rights, I proposed supplementing the existing rule on scheduling (Rule 50) to fold in victims' rights.
The Advisory Committee did not explicitly discuss this proposal, suggesting that its failure to act was possibly due to oversight.
487 Further suggesting oversight is the Advisory Committee's repeated statements that it sought to incorporate, but not go
480
18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(6) (2006).
481
See Heaton, 458 F. Supp. 2d at 1271-73 (reaching this conclusion). In Heaton, the government did not challenge this holding and, after
the decision requiring it to submit the victim's views, filed a pleading to that effect, all without any apparent separation of powers problem.

beyond, the rights created by statute and that it adopted the statutory language whenever possible. 488 Yet under the
Advisory Committee's proposed changes, victims' speedy trial rights under the CVRA are not incorporated into the Rules.
Victims should have their rights regarding scheduling reflected in the rule dealing with scheduling issues. My proposed rule
closely tracks the language of [*948] the CVRA. 489 It does add a provision that victims would be heard on a motion to
continue a proceeding. 490 This provision is consistent with the definitive legislative history. As Senator Kyl explained: This
provision [in the CVRA] should be interpreted so that any decision to schedule, reschedule, or continue criminal cases should
include victim input through the victim's assertion of the right to be free from unreasonable delay. 491 My proposed rule also
requires that the court state its reason for granting any continuance. This requirement stems from a recommendation from the
President's Task Force on Victims of Crime. The Task Force noted the inherent human tendency to postpone matters, often for
insufficient reason, and accordingly recommended that reasons for any granted continuance … be clearly stated on the
record. 492 Several states have adopted similar provisions. 493
Rule 53 - Closed-Circuit Transmission of Proceedings for Victims The Proposals:
I proposed that closed-circuit transmission of court proceedings for victims should be authorized as follows:
Rule 53. Courtroom Photographing and Broadcasting Prohibited
(a) General Rule. Except as otherwise provided by a statute or these rules, the court must not permit the taking of photographs
in the courtroom during judicial proceedings or the broadcasting of judicial proceedings from the courtroom.
(b) Closed-Circuit Transmission for Victims. In order to permit victims of crime to watch criminal trial proceedings, the court
may authorize closed-circuit televising of the proceedings for viewing by victims or other persons the court determines have a
compelling interest in doing so. 494
The Advisory Committee proposed no change to this rule. 495
[*949] Discussion:
I proposed to facilitate a victim's protected right to attend a trial by allowing closed-circuit broadcasting of a trial. The Advisory
Committee did not act on this proposal for reasons that are unclear, as it did not include this proposed change in the catalog of
my proposals that it was rejecting. 496
Perhaps the Advisory Committee felt that it had sufficiently addressed the subject in its proposed changes to Rule 60. There the
Committee simply tracked language in the CVRA and provided that if the court finds that the number of victims makes it
impracticable to accord all of the victims the rights described in subsection (a), the court must fashion a reasonable procedure

to give effect to these rights that does not unduly complicate or prolong the proceedings. 497 Thus, in a situation where
numerous victims might overwhelm courtroom seating capacity, the court might craft a reasonable alternative procedure to
assure attendance rights. One such reasonable procedure would appear to be closed-circuit transmission of court proceedings to
a facility sufficiently large to accommodate all the victims. This was the procedure followed in the Oklahoma City bombing
case. 498
But tracking the CVRA is not enough. The language for my proposed rule comes from another statute, 42 U.S.C. § 10608(a),
which authorizes closed-circuit transmissions notwithstanding any provision of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to the
contrary in cases in which a proceeding has been transferred more than 350 miles. 499 The Advisory Committee repeatedly
proposed folding language from the CVRA straight into the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. But if the goal is to fold
statutes into the Rules, other relevant victims' statutes should be folded in as well.
While folding in a provision on closed-circuit broadcasting, there appears to be no good reason to limit such transmissions to
such situations where venue has been transferred. The CVRA mandates that the courts must always craft reasonable
procedures to protect the rights of multiple victims. 500 The proposed rule simply authorizes courts to allow such
transmissions in appropriate cases. Interestingly, the CVRA's drafters specifically endorsed the closed-circuit procedure. 501
[*950] For reasons that have yet to be articulated, the Advisory Committee has not only failed to act on my proposal but it has
left in place a conflict between a statute and Rule 53. As noted above, 42 U.S.C. § 10608(a) specifically trumps Rule 53 in
situations where cases have been transferred more than 350 miles. 502 The Rules should at least be amended to fix that conflict.
503 While fixing that problem, the Advisory Committee should also adopt my change, which faithfully implements the CVRA's
commands.
(New) Rule 60(a)(1) - Notice of Proceedings for Victims The Proposals:
I proposed requiring federal prosecutors to give notice to crime victims of their rights and the court process as follows:
Rule 10.1 Notice to Victims.
(a) Identification of Victim. During the prosecution of a case, the attorney for the government shall, at the earliest reasonable
opportunity, identify the victims of the crime.
(b) Notice of Case Events. During the prosecution of a crime, the attorney for the government shall make reasonable efforts to
provide victims the earliest possible notice of:

accommodate multiple victims).
502
42 U.S.C. § 10608(a).
503
Perhaps it could be argued that Rule 53 itself accommodates any conflict because its prohibition of broadcasting applies except as
otherwise provided by a statute or these rules. Fed. R. Crim. P. 53. But reliance on that language is a bit odd because it should go without
saying that nothing in the Rules can trump a substantive statute passed by Congress. See 28 U.S.C. § 2072(b). Moreover, as a simple matter
of drafting clarity, it is desirable to have the Rules themselves avoid conflicts with statutes. Otherwise, courts may inadvertently follow the
Rules in violation of the statutory command. See, e.g., Cassell, Barbarians at the Gates, supra note 6, at 516 (recounting how this happened in
the Oklahoma City bombing case).

(1) The scheduling, including scheduling changes and/or continuances, of each court proceeding that the victim is either
required to attend or entitled to attend;
(2) The release or detention status of a defendant or suspected offender;
(3) The filing of charges against a defendant, or the proposed dismissal of all charges, including the placement of the defendant
in a pretrial diversion program and the conditions thereon;
(4) The right to make a statement about pretrial release of the defendant;
(5) The victim's right to make a statement about acceptance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere;
[*951] (6) The victim's right to attend public proceedings;
(7) If the defendant is convicted, the date and place set for sentencing and the victim's right to address the court at sentencing;
and
(8) After the defendant is sentenced, the sentence imposed and the availability of the Bureau of Prisons notification program,
which shall provide the date, if any, on which the offender will be eligible for parole or supervised release.
(c) Multiple Victims. The attorney for the government shall advise the court if the attorney believes that the number of victims
makes it impracticable to provide personal notice to each victim. If the court finds that the number of victims makes it
impracticable to give personal notice to each victim desiring to receive notice, the court shall fashion a reasonable procedure
calculated to give reasonable notice under the circumstances. 504
The Advisory Committee proposed to add language in its global victims rule (Rule 60(a)(1)) that would give victims notice
only of court proceedings:
Rule 60. Victims
(a) In General.
(1) Notice of a Proceeding. The government must use its best efforts to give the victim reasonable, accurate, and timely notice
of any public court proceeding involving the crime. 505
Discussion:
The difference between my proposal and the Advisory Committee's is that I would give victims notice of both the hearings held
in a case and the fact that they can speak at some of those hearings; in contrast, the Advisory Committee would give victims
notice only of the hearings. For example, I would place in the rule a requirement that victims be notified of their right to make a
statement at bail, plea, and sentencing hearings and told when the hearings would be held. The Advisory Committee would tell
the victim only when the hearings would be held. 506
[*952] The Committee proposal disregards both the law and sound public policy. The CVRA directs that government
investigating and prosecuting agencies shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded,
504
Cassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 859-60.
505
Proposed Amendments, supra note 71, R. 60, at 22.
506
The Committee did agree with my recommendation that the notice should be provided by the Justice Department, not the courts. See
Cassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 861-64. Originally, the CVRA Subcommittee had proposed that the Rules be silent on this
important issue. See Advisory Committee Minutes, supra note 68, at 14 (suggesting that it is not clear whose burden it would be to provide
such notice and Professor Beale recommended the passive phrasing). Apparently at some point after the meeting, the Advisory Committee
chose to place the notification burden squarely on the government. See Advisory Committee Report, supra note 69, at 5. The Advisory
Committee apparently recognized that this requirement was already the law, as found in another statute, 42 U.S.C. § 10607(b), (c)(3)(A)-(D).
DAVID SCHOEN
2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *952
Page 65 of 78
their rights [in the CVRA]. 507 Because the Advisory Committee's promised approach was to incorporate, but not go beyond,
the rights created by the statute, 508 it is surprising to see that the Committee decided not to incorporate the CVRA's right for
victims to be notified of … their rights. Here again, perhaps it simply overlooked this right of victims. 509
As a policy matter, leaving out this right threatens to cripple crime victims' right to speak at bail, plea, and sentencing hearings.
If victims are unaware of their rights to speak, they may unwittingly forfeit that right. Of course, few victims are
knowledgeable about the steps in the criminal justice process. Just as criminal defendants receive advice of their Miranda
rights, victims should receive advice of their rights.
Although the Committee did not justify its decision to exclude the right to notice, it might conceivably argue that because this
right does not involve the conduct of a public judicial proceeding, it does not belong in the Rules. The Committee advanced
such an argument to defend its decision to ignore some other aspects of the CVRA in its proposed rule changes. 510
Such an argument, at least if advanced with respect to notice issues, would lack merit. First, and most important, the rights at
issue are directly bound up with judicial proceedings: at issue is notice about the right to speak at bail, plea, and sentencing
proceedings. Moreover, this right directly bears on those proceedings. It is designed to ensure that a judge at these hearings will
have all relevant information, including information from crime victims.
Second, it is not true that the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure only cover judicial proceedings. To provide a few
straightforward examples: Rule 11 authorizes prosecutors and defense attorneys to discuss and reach a plea agreement; 511
Rule 16 provides that, upon request, a prosecutor must permit the defendant to inspect and to copy or photograph books,
papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible objects, buildings or places, or copies or portions of any of these items, if the
item is within the government's possession, custody, or control; 512 Rule 41 requires a police officer executing a search
warrant to give a copy of the warrant and a receipt for the property taken to the person from whom [*953] … the property
was taken; 513 and Rule 49 requires parties to serve their legal pleadings on each other. 514 Although these rights may have
some ultimate effect on a court proceeding, none of them involves the conduct of a judicial proceeding. If they are in bounds
for the Rules of Criminal Procedure, the subject of notice about rights to a hearing would seem to fit comfortably as well.
Turning to how to draft a rule giving victims notice of their rights, it is easy to reformulate my proposal so that it tracks the
more abbreviated style preferred by the Advisory Committee. Such a rule would read as follows (underlined language being
added to the Advisory Committee's proposed language):
(1) Notice of a Proceeding. The government must use its best efforts to give the victim reasonable, accurate, and timely notice
of any public court proceeding involving the crime and of the rights the victim has at those proceedings.
It is not unreasonable to ask prosecutors to give victims notice of their rights. As long ago as 1982, the President's Task Force
of Victims of Crime concluded that the prosecutor is in the best position to explain to victims the legal significance of various
motions and proceedings. 515 The Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance already require

prosecutors and their agents to provide notice to crime victims for their rights, 516 as do some states. 517 To ensure that the
Justice Department has sufficient resources to provide notice, the CVRA authorizes $ 25 million over the next five fiscal years
to the Office for Victims of Crime of the Department of Justice for enhancement of victim notification systems. 518 The
Advisory Committee should therefore add language to its proposed rule change to require prosecutors to give victims notice of
their rights.
[*954] (New) Rule 60(a)(1) - Proceeding Without Notice to a Victim The Proposals:
I proposed spelling out what would happen in circumstances where a court wanted to proceed with a hearing but no notice had
been given to a victim as follows:
(b) Proceeding With and Without Notice. The court may proceed with a public proceeding without a victim if proper notice has
been provided to that victim under Rule 10.1. The court may proceed with a public proceeding (other than a trial or sentencing)
without proper notice to a victim only if doing so is in the interest of justice, the court provides prompt notice to that victim of
the court's action and of the victim's right to seek reconsideration of the action if a victim's right is affected, and the court
ensures that notice will be properly provided to that victim for all subsequent public proceedings. 519
The Advisory Committee did not propose any such change. 520
Discussion:
It seemed desirable to me to spell out how courts should proceed when victims lacked notice of a hearing. In contrast, the
Advisory Committee has chosen not to address the subject.
By not addressing the subject, the Advisory Committee may be suggesting that the court is forbidden from moving forward
when a victim has not been given notice of a proceeding. The caselaw makes clear that when a defendant has not been given
notice, any subsequent court action is void. 521 The CVRA's legislative history shows that the same rule was to apply for
victims. As Senator Kyl explained,
It does not make sense to enact victims' rights that are rendered useless because the victim never knew of the proceeding at
which the right had to be asserted. Simply put, a failure to provide notice of proceedings at which a right can be asserted is
equivalent to a violation of the right itself. 522
[*955] In light of the fact that a court might otherwise be barred from proceeding when a victim has not been given notice, it
still seems preferable to me to spell out a way to allow the court to move forward while simultaneously protecting victims'
interests. But I will not elaborate the point further here.

victims the right to attend court proceedings except in those very rare instances where the victim's testimony would be

materially altered by attending the trial. 523 Because the Advisory Committee proposal essentially tracks my proposal, it is not
necessary to discuss this issue here.
(New) Rule 60(a)(3) - Victims' Right to be Heard on Bail, Plea, Sentencing and Other Issues The Proposals:
I proposed not only specific rules allowing victim to be heard at release, plea, and sentencing hearings but also a general rule
giving victims the right to be heard on all issues directly affecting their rights as follows:
Right to be Heard on Victims' Issues. In addition to rights to be heard established elsewhere in these rules, at any public
proceeding at which a victim has the right to attend, the victim has the right to be heard on any matter directly affecting a
victim's right. 524
The Advisory Committee proposed only a narrow rule giving victims the right to be heard at only three specific points in the
process - bail, plea, and sentencing hearings:
Right to Be Heard. The court must permit a victim to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court
concerning release, plea, or sentencing involving the crime. 525
[*956] Discussion:
The Advisory Committee's proposed general rule on the victim's right to be heard is inferior to weaving that right into the
specific rules on release, plea, and sentencing. This issue is discussed earlier in this Article. 526 The larger issue to pursue here
is the silence of the Advisory Committee on how a court should proceed when a victim's rights under the CVRA are at stake in
other proceedings. For example, what if the court is considering continuing a trial in violation of a victim's right to
proceedings free from unreasonable delay? 527 Or excluding the victim from a proceeding in violation of a victim's right not
to be excluded from … public court proceeding? 528 Or turning over to the defense personal and confidential information
about the victim in violation of a victim's right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and
privacy? 529 Or giving a defendant the victim's home address in an alibi situation in violation of the victim's right to be
reasonably protected from the accused? 530
My proposed rule would state directly that the victim has the right to be heard on such issues. How the Advisory Committee
would handle such issues is unclear. The Advisory Committee's proposed rule on the victim's right to be heard only confers
such a right for three specific hearings. The listing of three hearings might seem to suggest victims could not be heard
elsewhere. But denying victims a chance to be heard at other hearings where their rights are implicated is such an obvious
violation of fundamental notions of fairness (not to mention the victim's right to fairness under the CVRA) that one should be
reluctant to ascribe that position to the Advisory Committee.

Part of the confusion here may stem from two different ways in which victims can be heard. The first way is when the victim's
statement is effectively built into the proceeding at issue. At sentencing hearings, for example, the CVRA envisions a specific
point in the process where the victim will have a chance to make a statement - the victim's allocution. 531 This is what the
CVRA means when it refers to the victim's right to be heard at sentencing proceedings (along with plea and bail proceedings).
But the listing of victims' rights to be heard at those three specific hearings could not possibly have meant that victims would
have to remain silent at all other hearings.
[*957] The CVRA envisions victims being heard in second sense - in arguing in favor of their rights. The CVRA directly gives
victims and their representatives the right to assert their rights. 532 These rights can be asserted by a victim's representative
(that is, an attorney). 533 The CVRA also allows victims to file motions asserting their rights which must be taken up
forthwith. 534 These are all ways in which victims can properly be heard. 535
The CVRA's legislative history makes it unmistakably clear that victims would be heard at other points in the process. Senator
Feinstein explained that the basic goal of the CVRA was to give victims the right to participate in the process where the
information that victims and their families can provide may be material and relevant … . 536 Senator Kyl also noted that the
act's enforcement provisions would give victims rights to be heard throughout the process:
[The CVRA's enforcement provisions] allow[] a crime victim to enter the criminal trial court during proceedings involving the
crime against the victim, [to stand with other counsel in the well of the court,] and assert the rights provided by this bill. This
provision ensures that crime victims have standing to be heard in trial courts so that they are heard at the very moment when
their rights are at stake and this, in turn, forces the criminal justice system to be responsive to a victims' rights in a timely way.
537
As one illustration of how this right to be heard operates, consider the victim's right to proceedings free from unreasonable
delay. 538 Presumably, this right encompasses a victim's opportunity to be heard before a case is delayed. As Senator Kyl
stated: This provision should be interpreted so that any decision to schedule, reschedule, or continue criminal cases should
include victim input through the victim's assertion of the right to be free from unreasonable delay. 539
In view of all the different ways in which crime victims can be heard, it is appropriate to have a rule that speaks broadly to the
subject and protects victims' right to be heard whenever their rights are at stake. My proposed rule achieves that goal.
[*958] (New) Rule 60(b) - Enforcement of Victims' Rights The Proposals:
I proposed folding into the procedures a victim's right to assert an error as follows:
Rule 51. Preserving Claimed Error

(b) Preserving a Claim of Error. A party or a victim may preserve a claim of error by informing the court - when the court
ruling or order is made or sought - of the action the party wishes the court to take, or the party's objection to the court's action
and the grounds for that objection. If a party or a victim does not have an opportunity to object to a ruling or order, the absence
of an objection does not later prejudice that party. A ruling or order that admits or excludes evidence is governed by Federal
Rule of Evidence 103. 540
The Advisory Committee proposed incorporating some of the language of the CVRA dealing with enforcement of victims'
rights as follows:
Rule 60. Victim's Rights.
… .
(b) Enforcement and Limitations.
(1) Time for Decision. The court must promptly decide any motion asserting a victim's rights under these rules.
(2) Who May Assert Rights. The rights of a victim under these rules may be asserted by the victim or the attorney for the
government.
(3) Multiple Victims. If the court finds that the number of victims makes it impracticable to accord all of the victims the rights
described in subsection (a), the court must fashion a reasonable procedure to give effect to these rights that does not unduly
complicate or prolong the proceedings.
(4) Where Rights may be Asserted. The rights described in subsection (a) must be asserted in the district in which a defendant
is being prosecuted for the crime.
(5) Limitations on Relief. A victim may make a motion to re-open a plea or sentence only if:
(A) the victim has asked to be heard before or during the proceeding at issue and the request was denied;
[*959] (B) the victim petitions the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus within 10 days of the denial and the writ is
granted; and
(C) in the case of a plea, the accused has not pleaded to the highest offense charged.
(6) No New Trial. In no case is a failure to afford a victim any right under these rules grounds for a new trial. 541
Discussion:
I proposed to essentially create a rule for victims to assert error, leaving additional details to be treated elsewhere. The
Advisory Committee proposed to fold into the Rules of Criminal Procedure some of the enforcement provisions and restrictions
in the CVRA.
Because the Advisory Committee's proposal largely tracks the CVRA, much in it is unobjectionable. But the Advisory
Committee deviates from the CVRA's language in five places for reasons that are unexplained - and unexplainable. The patient
reader of this Article may not be surprised that all five of these deviations operate in the same direction - to reduce a crime
victim's rights from what Congress has commanded.

First, in Proposed Rule 60(b)(1), the Advisory Committee has watered down the CVRA's directive that a court must decide any
victim's motion forthwith 542 to promptly. While there is nothing wrong with this change as a matter of style, 543 it does
appear to reduce the speed with which courts will have to act to enforce victims' rights. Forthwith can be interpreted to be
more exacting requirement than promptly. 544 Given that the Advisory Committee's premise that, where possible, it should
incorporate the language of the CVRA, 545 it is unclear why it chose to substitute promptly for the forthwith requirement.
Second, in Proposed Rule 60(b)(2), the Advisory Committee has inexplicably left out the right of the victim's representative to
assert a victim's right (along with [*960] the victim herself and the prosecutor). 546 This omission is criticized earlier in this
Article. 547
Third, in Proposed Rule 60(b)(5)(a) through (c), the Advisory Committee sets out three requirements for a victim to file a
motion to reopen a sentence - requirements taken straight from the CVRA. 548 Without explanation, however, the Advisory
Committee then leaves out the CVRA's qualification to these restrictions - this paragraph does not affect the victim's right to
restitution as provided in Title 18, United States Code. 549
Fourth, in Proposed Rule 60(b)(4), the Advisory Committee has left out the CVRA's venue provision which allows a victim to
assert her rights if no prosecution is underway, in the district court in the district in which the crime occurred. 550 In contrast
to the other three omissions just noted, the Advisory Committee specifically discussed whether to track the italicized language
in its proposed rule on asserting rights. Remarkably, it decided to take the statutory language out of the Rules:
Judge Levi expressed concern over the final phrase in Rule [60(b)(4)], which gives a victim the right to assert rights if no
prosecution is underway, in the court in the district in which the crime occurred. Judge Jones said the Crime Victims Rights
Act affords victims certain rights even in the absence of a case. Judge Levi noted, however, that the criminal rules only apply to
proceedings in filed cases. Judge Jones explained that the subcommittee had decided to include it because there might be a preprosecution
proceeding of some sort to which the provision might apply. There was discussion as to whether a grand jury
investigation might qualify as such. Professor Beale said that, while the Act might give victims certain rights, such as being
treated respectfully, Judge Levi was probably correct that the rights covered by the criminal rules could only be asserted with
respect to a case being prosecuted. After further discussion, Judge Jones said the phrase would be deleted, as Judge Levi had
suggested. 551

This resulted in the Advisory Committee proposing a rule that recites only half of the CVRA's venue provision. The rule as
proposed by the Advisory Committee provides that the rights described in [the rules] must be asserted in [*961] the district in
which a defendant is being prosecuted for the crime, 552 leaving silent what a victim should do if no prosecution is underway.
Once again, the confusion that the Advisory Committee discovered in the statute stems from the committee's failure to give
effect to (among other things) the victim's right to fairness. The CVRA extends the requirement for fair treatment not only to
prosecutors and courts, but also to all officers and employees of the Department of Justice and other departments and agencies
of the United States engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution of crime … . 553 (I will call this the CVRA's
coverage provision.) It is, of course, easily conceivable that investigative agencies might violate a victim's right to fairness
before formal criminal proceedings were initiated. Because no prosecution is underway in such circumstances, the victim
would need to assert their rights (in the language of the CVRA's venue provision) in the district court in the district in which
the crime occurred.
Under the Advisory Committee's proposal, a victim who is treated unfairly by a federal investigative agency will lack any place
to assert her right to fair treatment - in contravention of a teaching that traces back at least to Marbury v. Madison that where
there is a legal right, there is also a legal remedy. 554 The Advisory Committee, however, seems to think that this is not a
problem to be addressed in the Rules because the rights covered by the criminal rules could only be asserted with respect to a
case being prosecuted. But, of course, this assumption depends on limiting the rights in the CVRA to such narrow provisions
as the right to be heard on sentencing and other issues, because these rights attach only to any public proceeding. 555 This
assumption fails if the right to be treated fairly (not to mention the right to be treated with dignity and respect and other rights)
is in the mix - as CVRA's plain language demands.
The Advisory Committee seemed to recognize the venue problem for cases with no prosecution underway when it discussed
the fact that victims may now have rights in the grand jury process (a subject squarely covered by the criminal rules 556 ). But
other examples exist as well. For example, federal agents may improperly tread on a victim's rights through a search warrant
(another subject covered by the criminal rules 557 ). Or in the course of their investigation, they may mishandle evidence in a
way that treads on a victim's dignity (improperly disseminating a nude or pornographic photograph of a victim, for instance.
558 ) In [*962] all these situations, victims are at least entitled to a forum to assert their rights to be treated with fairness and
with respect for their dignity and privacy - yet the Advisory Committee has excised the CVRA's venue provision that provides
the forum.

alleged mishandling of nude photograph during state police investigation).
The examples given in the text are just illustrations, and there may be many more situations where a victim's rights might be violated before
charges are filed. In particular, the victim might not receive notice of their rights before charges are filed. The Justice Department's own
guidelines provide that a victim must receive notice of rights at the earliest opportunity after detection of a crime at which it may be done
without interfering with an investigation. Dep't of Justice, Attorney General Guidelines, supra note 161, at 23. Moreover, existing federal
law requires the same notification, although this law is found outside the CVRA. See 42 U.S.C. § 10607 (notice to victim must be given at
the earliest opportunity after the detection of a crime at which it may be done without interfering with an investigation.).

It is important to emphasize one argument the Advisory Committee does not appear to make: that the CVRA applies only to
charged crimes. Any such argument would not only fly squarely in the face of the CVRA's venue and coverage provisions
applying victims' rights against investigating agencies, but also of the CVRA's clear legislative history. Discussing the CVRA's
definition of a crime victim, 559 Senator Kyl said the statute used an intentionally broad definition because all victims of
crime deserve to have their rights protected, whether or not they are the victim of the count charged. 560
At least one federal magistrate judge has suggested, in dicta, that - in spite of Senator Kyl's plain statement - the CVRA might
not apply until charges have been filed. 561 His primary reason for doing so, however, was that the Supreme Court's decision in
Hughey v. United States, 562 suggested this result. To be sure, the victims statute at issue in Hughey (the Victim Witness
Protection Act) did employ a similar definition of victim as that found in the CVRA. But Hughey turned on the fact that other
language in the restitution statute provided that a defendant convicted of an offense' may be ordered to make restitution to
any victim of such offense.' 563 Such a straightforward holding says little about a statute - such as the fairness provision in
the CVRA - that contains no such limiting language regarding persons convicted … of [an] offense. Moreover, the magistrate
judge did not discuss the CVRA's coverage and venue provisions, which plainly dictate that the CVRA applies to crimes not yet
charged. For all these reasons, the [*963] Advisory Committee should apply the CVRA as written and include a venue
provision both for prosecuted and not-yet-prosecuted crimes.
Fifth, and most important, in proposed Rule 60(b)(2), the Advisory Committee gives victims the power to assert rights under
these rules. As has been noted throughout this Article, the Rules as they would be amended by the Advisory Committee leave
out many of the victims' rights under the CVRA. For example, the victims right to a speedy trial has not been included in the
proposed rule changes. 564 By giving victims the power to only assert the limited number of rights listed under these rules,
the Advisory Committee ignores many victims' rights under the CVRA. At the very least, the language should be changed to
make clear that victims to assert all rights that they have under the CVRA.
One change that the Advisory Committee should not make is worth brief mention: The Advisory Committee should not add a
provision for a fact-finding hearing to determine whether someone is a victim of crime. In its comment on the pending
proposed amendments, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) has proposed such a procedure.
The rationale it gives is that the conferring of rights' on the victim' comes, in general, at the expense of the defendant. Thus,
due process requires that a provision be added to these Rules for a factfinding hearing, to be held whenever the proper labeling
of a person as victim,' is in dispute … . 565
The NACDL's rationale is patently defective. The rights in the CVRA do not interfere with any rights of the defendant, as
pointed out throughout this Article. 566 For instance, for victims to be notified of court hearings, to attend those hearings, and

While the CVRA extends to uncharged crimes, it is also obvious that the CVRA does not grant victims any rights against individuals who
have not been convicted of a crime. In re W.R. Huff Asset Mgmt. Co., 409 F.3d 555, 564 (2d Cir. 2005) (emphasis added); accord Searcy v.
Skinner, No. 6:06-1418-GRA-WMC, 2006 WL 1677177, at 2 (D.S.C. June 16, 2006). Like the constitutional amendment it was patterned on,
the CVRA extends rights against the government - that is, rights not to be victimized again through the process by which government
DAVID SCHOEN
2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *963
Page 73 of 78
to speak at those hearings does not interfere with the defendant's right to be notified of those hearings, attend those hearings,
and to speak at those hearings. Perhaps this is why the NACDL could only assert that in general victims' rights harm
defendants - the NACDL did not provide a single supporting example.
Moreover, the procedure that the NACDL would put in place - a full evidentiary hearing with the defendant able to crossexamine
the victim to be determine victim status - is novel and unwarranted. While crime victims' rights have existed in all
fifty states and the federal system for the last two decades, no [*964] jurisdiction has ever required anything like this. 567
Instead, procedural issues of how to determine victim status are left to the sound discretion of the trial courts.
To give a defendant an automatic right to challenge victim status raises constitutional and other problems. A defendant who
simply complained about a victim designation would lack standing under Article III of the Constitution, because there would
be no threatened or actual injury resulting from the putatively illegal action. 568 Moreover, to give defendants free license to
cross-examine victims about whether they were truly victims would obviously create a right to discovery in a criminal case that
contradicts current law 569 and circumvents the stringent limitations on depositions of witnesses found in Rule 15. 570 The
potential for abusive questioning of victims in such hearings (where no jury is present to be alienated) should also not be
overlooked. 571 The victims' rights provisions in this country have never been used to give defendants new rights to question
and potentially traumatize victims. The CVRA's expansion of victims' rights should not be the occasion to start. 572
V. Conclusion
This Article has tried to make the case for specific changes to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to protect crime
victims' rights, particularly those rights listed in the CVRA. The Article has attempted to sketch out one way that the Rules
could be amended to do this while at the same time contending that the Advisory Committee's pending victims' rights proposals
are too restrictive. In concluding the Article, it may be useful to raise broader concerns about the Advisory Committee's
minimalist approach.
In reviewing the Advisory Committee's proposals, some might reach the conclusion that the Committee treated the victims
issue as a chore to be survived rather than an opportunity to be seized. One can read the Committee's proposals and the minutes
of its discussions without finding much enthusiasm for the idea of crime victims becoming a part of the criminal justice
process. This reluctance may be part of a larger phenomenon of hostility by the legal culture to crime victims, as other scholars
and I have argued elsewhere. 573

[*965] Any lack of interest in crime victims is regrettable and might lead to harmful consequences. Congress has decided that
crime victims must be fully integrated into the federal criminal justice system. The Rules of Criminal Procedure are an
important part of that system and must fully reflect the congressionally protected interests of crime victims. If the judiciary will
not do the job, no doubt Congress will step in to finish the task. Indeed, Congress will be looking carefully at the CVRA's
effectiveness in changing the system in 2008, as it directed the General Accounting Office to prepare and submit to the
appropriate committees a report on the effectiveness of the act at that time. 574
It would be unfortunate if initiative for rules on crime victims were to pass from the courts to Congress. The courts do have
institutional advantages in assessing changes in the Rules. 575 The rulemaking committees are staffed with judges who have
long experience in applying rules of procedure. And the rulemaking process itself guarantees considerable public involvement
and careful deliberation about any rules that are ultimately adopted.
But having a good rulemaking process is one thing; producing a good product is another. Unfortunately, the Advisory
Committee's current proposals do not treat crime victims fairly and, even more indisputably, do not fully implement Congress's
commands in the CVRA. As the CVRA directs, crime victims are now participants in the federal criminal justice system. The
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure must faithfully reflect that new reality and ensure that crime victims, no less than
prosecutors and defendants, are treated fairly throughout the process.
VI. Afterword
After this Article was completed in January 2007, several significant developments occurred that are relevant to rule changes
discussed here. First, several members of Congress wrote the Advisory Committee to explain that they were concerned about
the timid approach to implementing the CVRA. Then, in the spring and summer of 2007, the Advisory Committee itself made
several changes to the Rules discussed in this Article. Finally, as anticipated in the conclusion to this Article, Congress has
begun to move on legislation that would finish the task of enshrining crime victims' rights in the federal rules. Rather than
revise the Article in light of these subsequent developments, it seemed to make more sense to let the Article stand as originally
written and supplement it with a brief afterward discussing each of these developments.
[*966]
A. Congressional Public Comment on the Advisory Committee's Proposed Rules
Public comment on the Advisory Committee's proposed rule changes closed in February 2007. As comment was closing,
several members of Congress wrote the Committee, confirming that they too are troubled by the minimalist approach to the
proposed CVRA amendments. On February 15, 2007, Senator Jon Kyl wrote to the Committee to express his strong concern
about the proposed amendments. He explained as follows:
As a sponsor of the Act, I believe that passage by overwhelming majorities in both the House and the Senate signifies
Congress's intent to provide crime victims with substantive rights and protections in federal court. But the proposed
amendments do little more than reiterate limited parts of the statute. Crime victims have been mistreated by the federal
criminal justice system for far too long. To comply with Congress's intent, the Advisory Committee must take decisive and …
comprehensive action to thoroughly amend the rules and fully ensure that crime victims are protected in federal courts. 576
Senator Kyl went on to say he fully endorsed my specific proposals, indicating that they were, however, in some areas too
cautious. 577

In response to this Article and to other public criticisms of its rules, the Advisory Committee made several modest changes to
its proposed rules. These changes are discussed in numerical order here. Other than these changes, no significant changes were
made to the proposed rules discussed here. The Advisory Committee has submitted them all to the Supreme Court and, unless
the Court takes the unusual step of disavowing them, they will go into effect on December 1, 2008.
Rule 1. In apparent response to my criticism that the definition of victim found in Rule 1 intentionally excluded a victim's
representative, 578 on April 16, 2007, the Advisory Committee amended its proposed Rule 60 to allow a victim's
representative to assert a right. Rule 60(b)(2) now provides: A victim's rights described in these rules may be asserted by the
victim, the victim's lawful representative, the attorney for the government, or any other person as authorized [*967] by 18
U.S.C. § 3771(d) and (e). 579 This change insures that victims' representatives will be able to assert victims' rights. The
Advisory Committee also added language to the Committee Note stating that courts could make appropriate findings to resolve
any dispute about who is a victim. 580
Rule 5. At its October 1, 2007 meeting in Utah, the Advisory Committee approved a proposed change to Rule 5 regarding
detention hearings. The proposed addition to Rule 5 reads: In making the decision to detain or release the defendant, the judge
must consider the right of the victim to be reasonably protected from the defendant. 581 This language was lifted almost
straight from Senator Kyl's proposed legislation implementing the CVRA 582 (which is discussed in the next section). This
seems like a valuable addition to the Rules, helping to protect victims' rights in detention decisions.
Rule 12.1. At its April 16, 2007 meeting, the Advisory Committee apparently agreed with my conclusion that courts lack
authority to force a victim to meet with a defendant 583 and struck language recommending such a meeting from its Committee
note. 584
Rule 12.3. Also at its October 1, 2007 meeting, the Advisory Committee responded to my point that the same language appears
in both Rule 12.1 (alibi defense) and Rule 12.3 (public authority defense) regarding disclosure of addresses of crime victims.
585 It therefore proposed to add the same changes to Rule 12.3 that it added to Rule 12.1. 586 Unfortunately, for the reasons
discussed at length here, now the language in both Rule 12.1 and 12.3 is insufficiently protective of victims' rights. 587
Rule 17. At its April 16, 2007 meeting, the Advisory Committee revised its rule on subpoenas for confidential information to
read: Before entering the order and unless there are exceptional circumstances, the court must require that notice be given to
the victim so that the victim can move to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object. 588 This change responds to
objections from the American Bar Association, other groups, and me that the earlier rule encouraged ex parte [*968] issuance

of subpoenas for confidential information and thus violated important due process principles. 589 The new rule is an
improvement, in that it limits ex parte procedures to exceptional circumstances. The Committee note then offers two
illustrations of exceptional circumstances. One is unobjectionable - where evidence … might be lost or destroyed if the
subpoena were delayed 590 - a standard exigent circumstance that justifies moving rapidly. But the other illustration - a
situation where the defense would be unfairly prejudiced by premature disclosure of a sensitive defense strategy 591 - remains
quite problematic, for reasons discussed earlier. 592
Rule 21. Also at its October 1, 2007 meeting, the Advisory Committee approved a very modest change to Rule 21(b), regarding
transfer of cases for convenience. The change reads:
Rule 21. Transfer for Trial
… .
(b) For Convenience. Upon the defendant's motion, the court may transfer the proceeding, or one or more counts, against that
defendant to another district for the convenience of the parties, and victim, and the witnesses, and in the interests of justice.
This change is modest, because (in my estimation) relatively few federal cases involving victims are transferred for
convenience under Rule 21(b). The more common situation is transfers for prejudice under Rule 21(a). 593 Thus, this change
is, at best, relatively inconsequential.
In any event, the change is defective. While the proposed rule lets the judge consider the victim's interest in determining
whether to transfer, the Advisory Committee did not adopt my recommendation to let crime victims be heard on transfer
decisions. 594 Without a mechanism for passing victim information along to the judge, an instruction to the judge to consider
the victims' interest is essentially meaningless. The Advisory Committee should remedy this defect by giving victims the right
to be heard on transfer decisions.
Rule 32. In possible response to my point that victims deserve the right to be heard at sentencing hearings by speaking
directly to the judge, 595 on April 16, 2007, the Advisory Committee modified its note to Rule 32(i)(4). The note now reads:
Absent unusual circumstances, any victim who is present should be [*969] allowed a reasonable opportunity to speak
directly to the judge. 596 While this is an improvement over earlier language, it still remains unclear what sorts of unusual
circumstances the Advisory Committee has in mind that would permit a judge to deny a victim her right under the CVRA to
speak. It is also odd that the Advisory Committee Note would apparently allow a judge to exclude a victim in some
circumstances, when the only two reported decisions on the issue have held directly to the contrary that victims have an
unequivocal right to speak to the judge. 597
Rule 60. In response to public comments, the Advisory Committee made several modest changes to Rule 60. Rule 60(a)(2) was
revised to make clear that the duty to permit full attendance arises in the context of the victim's possible exclusion. 598 As

discussed in connection with Rule 1 above, 599 Rule 60(b)(2) was revised to make clear that a victim's representative could
assert a victim's right.
C. The Last Word? Legislation to Fully Implement the CVRA
Unsatisfied with the timid approach taken by the Advisory Committee on the CVRA, Senator Jon Kyl introduced legislation to
comprehensively amend the federal rules on June 29, 2007. Senator Kyl explained that the Advisory Committee's amendments
do little more than reiterate limited parts of the statute. 600 Agreeing with the major premise of this Article - that crime
victims must be treated fairly in the criminal justice process - Senator Kyl noted: Of particular importance, the CVRA
guaranteed that crime victims would have the right to be treated with fairness.' My proposed amendments would add to the
Federal rules the changes needed to treat crime victims fairly. 601 Senator Kyl was also concerned about delay by the
Advisory Committee in moving forward with comprehensive amendments:
Congress enacted the CVRA in October 2004. In the almost 3 years since then, I have waited patiently to give the federal courts
the first opportunity to review the need for rule changes. At the same time, though, I have made clear my position, as one of the
cosponsors of the CVRA, that Congress expected significant reforms in the Federal rules. As I explained to my colleagues at
that time, the crime victims' [*970] community in this country was looking to the CVRA to serve as a model for the states and
a formula to fully protect crime victims. 602
Accordingly, Senator Kyl proposed a long string of direct amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to
comprehensively protect victims' rights.
Some of the legislation that Senator Kyl proposed tracked my proposals in this Article. For example, he proposed amendments
to a number of rules - including Rules 2, 10.1, 603 11(b)(4), 11(c)(1), 11(c)(2), 12.1, 12.3, 15, 21(e), 32(f)(1), 32(h), 43.1, 44,
46, and 50( c) - largely tracking my proposals.
But other proposed changes went well beyond those I propose here. For example, Senator Kyl proposed changing Rule 4's
provision dealing with execution of arrest warrants to require reasonable efforts to give notice to victims about the initial
appearance of an arrested suspect. 604 Along the same lines, Senator Kyl would give victims reasonable notice of any decision
to release a defendant at the initial appearance 605 as well as notice of any pretrial conference. 606 He also would give federal
prosecutors authority to release to a victim any discovery materials that have been released to the defendant. 607 To assist non-
English speaking crime victims, he proposes to give the courts authority to appoint an interpreter for the victim. 608 Senator
Kyl's bill would also require disclosure to the victim of any presentence report except any portion of such report excised by
the court for compelling reasons or made confidential by law. 609 And his bill would require that the victim be given a
reasonable opportunity to be heard before any motion for a new trial is granted. 610

As of this writing, the ultimate disposition of Senator Kyl's bill remains uncertain. But what is certain is that congressional
interest in crime victims' rights will remain strong. Congress has been working on far reaching crime victims' rights legislation
for several decades now and, indeed, many in Congress favor an amendment to the United States Constitution to protect
victims' rights. 611 Against that backdrop, it is unlikely that Congress will permit the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to
only haphazardly protect victims' rights. If the Advisory Committee does not complete the task of comprehensively reforming
the Rules to protect victims, Congress almost certainly will - and should - finish the job.

time, the Chinese government has severely limited the ability of US and other Western
media outlets to conduct normal news gathering activities within China, much less

to provide news feeds directly to Chinese listeners, viewers, and readers in China, by
limiting and blocking their Chinese-language websites and forbidding distribution of
their output within China itself.

Among the Chinese American community, China has long sought to influence—
even silence—voices critical of the PRC or supportive of Taiwan by dispatching
personnel to the United States to pressure these individuals and while also pressuring
their relatives in China. Beijing also views Chinese Americans as members of a
worldwide Chinese diaspora that presumes them to retain not only an interest in the
welfare of China but also a loosely defined cultural, and even political, allegiance to
the so-called Motherland. Such activities not only interfere with freedom of speech
within the United States but they also risk generating suspicion of Chinese Americans
even though those who accept Beijing’s directives are a very small minority.

In the technology sector, China is engaged in a multifaceted effort to misappropriate
technologies it deems critical to its economic and military success. Beyond economic
espionage, theft, and the forced technology transfers that are required of many joint
venture partnerships, China also captures much valuable new technology through its
investments in US high-tech companies and through its exploitation of the openness
of American university labs. This goes well beyond influence-seeking to a deeper

and more disabling form of penetration. The economic and strategic losses for the
United States are increasingly unsustainable, threatening not only to help China gain
global dominance of a number of the leading technologies of the future, but also to
undermine America’s commercial and military advantages.

Around the world, China’s influence-seeking activities in the United States are
mirrored in different forms in many other countries. To give readers a sense of

the variation in China’s influence-seeking efforts abroad, this report also includes
summaries of the experiences of eight other countries, including Australia, Canada,
France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, and the UK.

Toward Constructive Vigilance

In weighing policy responses to influence seeking in a wide variety of American

institutions, the Working Group has sought to strike a balance between passivity and

overreaction, confidence in our foundations and alarm about their possible subversion,

and the imperative to sustain openness while addressing the unfairness of contending

on a series of uneven playing fields. Achieving this balance requires that we differentiate

constructive from harmful forms of interaction and carefully gauge the challenge, lest we

remain outside to deal with the concierges or security guards or any other
interference, and to command and co-ordinate. We’d leave the same way we
came in, by sea.

Dado nodded. I found out later that he’d asked the same question of Manno,
who had proposed a classic regular-army raid. They would block the road with
ten armed paratroopers on each end with the aim of holding off resistance, while
another two dozen went in to the apartments and attacked. I could only assume
Dado concluded that this almost certainly wouldn’t work, at least not without
major trouble. It would certainly forfeit any chance of surprise.

“The mission is yours,” he said. “Manno will be in overall command,
offshore. Because we’re also planning to hit several other targets.”

The reason for the urgent summons was that the Mossad had confirmed all
three Palestinians would be in their apartments in 10 days’ time. Everyone
involved realized that — given its complexity, the obvious risks, and the
inevitable unknowns — the operation could well go wrong. In fact, one reason
for Dado’s “other targets” was to ensure that if it did, there would be successes
elsewhere to provide a credible justification for having sent Israeli forces into
Beirut. As we received further intelligence, new obstacles had to be factored in.
The main one was the presence of a gendarmerie, a Lebanese police post, at the
bottom end of the street, only 500 feet or so from the apartments. And we would
be operating in a crowded, up-market residential area. We could only hope that
at the hour we struck, most people would be in bed. Or out partying. This was,
after all, pre-civil war Beirut, the “Paris of the Middle East’.

In the years since, an extraordinary array of stories has grown up around the

remember reading in one earlier book, otherwise surprisingly accurate, about
our five weeks of intensive training. Even the full 10 days which I thought we’d
been given would have been a bonus. In fact, we had half that as a full team,
since our Mossad drivers, European-born Israelis, had to make their way
through Paris to Beirut as tourists, rent the cars and scout out our route from the
seashore to Rue Verdun.

There were four other operations planned alongside ours: three by paratroop
units and one by the Shayetet 13 SEALs, against a series of Fatah and
Democratic Front installations. Though all of them, like ours, would need help

victim would likely reside.
The Supreme Court's decisions on right of public access to trials bolsters the understanding of the Article II's provision to
protect the community interest. In cases such as Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, the Court has held that implicit in the
First Amendment is a guarantee of the public's right to attend trials. 3”4 Compelling victims’ interests underlie this guarantee.

a prosecution. 37° Victims are vitally interested in observing criminal trials because society has withdrawn both from the
victim and the vigilante the enforcement of criminal laws, but [it] cannot erase from people's consciousness the fundamental,
natural yearning to see justice done - or even the urge for retribution. 377

For purposes of this Article, it is not necessary to definitively trace how victims' constitutional interests play out against a
defendant's right to avoid a prejudicial trial. The very limited point here is merely that victims should be heard on any transfer,
so that a judge can make a fully informed decision. Even if the judge determines to transfer a case, the victim may have
valuable information for the judge on where to transfer the case (for example, to an adjacent district or state [*926] rather than

a distant one) or how to impanel an unbiased jury (for example, importing a jury rather than exporting the trial). 376

An illustration of the general approach of the proposed rule comes from the leading case of State v. Timmendequas, 37?

decided by the New Jersey Supreme Court. In Timmendequas, the trial judge imported a jury from a distant community to hear
a capital case rather than forcing the family of a murdered young girl to travel to another district. 78° Construing New Jersey
state law provisions similar to the CVRA's, the New Jersey Supreme Court explained that the trial judge properly considered
the views of the victim's family:

Over the past decade, both nationwide and in New Jersey, a significant amount of legislation has been passed implementing
increased levels of protection for victims of crime. Specifically, in New Jersey, the Legislature enacted the Crime Victim's Bill
of Rights. That amendment marked the culmination of the Legislature's efforts to increase the participation of crime victims in
the criminal justice system.

The purpose of the Victim's Rights Amendment was to enhance and protect the necessary role of crime victims and witnesses
in the criminal justice process. In furtherance of [that goal], the improved treatment of these persons should be assured through
the establishment of specific rights. One of the enumerated rights guaranteed for victims is to have inconveniences associated
with participation in the criminal justice process mmimized to the fullest extent possible.

GW has also studied CBD in psychiatric indications. Results from an exploratory study of
CBD (GWP42003) in schizophrenia were released in September 2015. The trial was a
Phase lla 6 week, placebo-controlled exploratory trial in 88 patients with schizophrenia
refractory to first line anti-psychotic medications. To be enrolled, patients must have
been treated for a minimum of four weeks on a first line anti-psychotic medication and
still have a PANSS total score in excess of 60. CBD was administered as adjunct therapy
ona background of antipsychotic medication. The trial did not have a primary endpoint,
but rather a number of exploratory endpoints.

CBD consistently demonstrated superiority to placebo, suggesting that CBD may have
substantial anti-psychotic effects. CBD produced statistically significant benefits
compared to placebo on the PANSS positive sub-scale (p=0.018), the Clinical Global
Impression of Severity (p=0.04) and Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (p=0.02).
The proportion of responders (improvement in PANSS Total score > 20%) was higher on
CBD than placebo (p=0.07), with an Odds Ratio of 2.65. Moreover, CBD trended superior
to placebo (p=0.07) on sub-domains of the PANSS that were particularly relevant to
cognition in people with schizophrenia. The Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms
showed a trend in favor of CBD, and reached statistical significance in patients taking
CBD together with a leading first line anti-psychotic medication. The rest of the
exploratory endpoints, many of which were other scales measuring functionality and
cognition in schizophrenia patients, also trended in favor of CBD.

Even in the context of schizophrenia, CBD produced a clean safety profile, with no
serious adverse events and a balanced incidence of adverse events compared to
placebo. The most common adverse events were diarrhea (9.3% CBD vs. 4.4% placebo),
nausea (7% CBD vs. 0% placebo), headache (7% CBD vs. 8.9% placebo) and somnolence
(0% CBD vs. 6.7% placebo). There were two withdrawals from the study due to
treatment-related adverse events, one each for CBD and placebo.

CBD's activity in schizophrenia is supported by pre-clinical data in animal models, as well
as by a recent study published in The Journal of Clinical investigations (2012) which
suggested CBD may be useful as either monotherapy or in combination with first line
anti-psychotic agents. Nonetheless, while the p-values suggest that CBD has activity, its
potency is difficult to judge without knowing the effect sizes. Therefore, additional data
from this and subsequent studies will be necessary to fully understand the potential of
CBD in schizophrenia. GW Pharma has indicated that it intends to pursue CBD's future
development in pediatric orphan neuropsychiatric indications.

court shall decline to hear a claim under
this paragraph
(A) if the foreign state was not desig-
nated as a state sponsor of terrorism

28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(7) (emphasis added).
The parties agree that the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia has not been designated a
state sponsor of terrorism. See 28 U.S.C.
§ 1605(a)(7)(A) (explaining there is no ju-
risdiction if “the foreign state was not
designated as a state sponsor of terrorism
under ... the Export Administration Act
of 1979 ... or ... the Foreign Assistance
Act of 1961”). Thus, this exception does
not provide an exception to immunity for
any of the Defendants raising the FSIA
defense here.

3. Torts Exception

In relevant part, the torts exception de-
prives a foreign sovereign of immunity in
actions:

in which money damages are sought

against a foreign state for personal inju-

ry or death, or damage to or loss of
property, occurring in the United States
and caused by the tortious act or omis-
sion of that foreign state or of any offi-
cial or employee of that foreign state
while acting within the scope of his of-
fice or employment; except this [excep-
tion] shall not apply to -
(A) any claim based upon the exercise
or performance or the failure to exer-
cise or perform a discretionary func-
tion regardless of whether the discre-
tion be abused.

28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(5). Second Circuit
law instructs that district courts must de-
termine whether the defendant’s alleged
acts were tortious under the laws of New
York and, if so, whether the defendant’s
acts were discretionary. Robinson, 269
F.3d at 142 (If those activities could not
render the Malaysian government liable

349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES

for a tort under New York law, then it
remained immune under § 1605(a)(5).”).
In the event that the act is tortious and
the acts were not discretionary, the alleged
tortfeasor is subject to suit under the
FSIA.

[19] The FSIA’s discretionary function
exception replicates the discretionary func-
tion exception found in the Federal Tort
Claims Act. See 28 U.S.C. § 2680(a).
Courts have found both exceptions are “in-
tended to preserve immunity for ‘decisions
grounded in social, economic, and political
policy”” Marchisella v. Gov't of Japan,
No. 02 Civ. 100238(DC), 2004 WL 307248, at
*2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 17, 2004) (citing United
States v. S.A. Empresa de Viacao Aerea
Rio Grandense (Varig Airlines), 467 U.S.
797, 814, 104 S.Ct. 2755, 81 L.Ed.2d 660
(1984) (interpreting FTCA)). Generally,
acts are discretionary if they are per-
formed at the planning level of govern-
ment, as opposed to the operational level.
Kline v. Kaneko, 685 F.Supp. 386, 392
(S.D.N.Y.1988) (finding decision to expel
plaintiff from Mexico was product of en-
forcement of immigration laws and there-
fore a discretionary function); Marchisel-
la, 2004 WL 307248, at *2 (finding decision
regarding placement of a water hose on a
ship was an operational function and there-
fore not discretionary and not protected by
the FSIA); Napolitano v. Tishman
Constr. Corp., No. 96 Civ. 4402(SJ), 1998
WL 102789, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 26, 1998)
(finding purchasing consulate buildings
and hiring contractor to renovate is a plan-
ning function and therefore discretionary).

Defendants argue that the Court should
not even consider the torts exception for
two reasons. First, they claim that for
this exception to apply, the entire tort
must have occurred in the United States,
which Defendants argue is not the case
here. Second, Defendants claim that
Plaintiffs impermissibly seek to contort a

acclaimed by one and all to be brilliant, and many brilliant people
think that if you can’t understand what they are thinking about, then
it is your fault not theirs. They are talking about complex issues that
interest them, and you should be able to follow along, and if you can’t
then you are a dope.

This works at MIT, sort of. No MIT student happily admits to not
understanding what the professor is saying. They all muddle through
as best they can and are usually awestruck by even being in the pres-
ence of these great men, much less being able to take a course from
them. Understanding what they said, or, worse, actually being able
to make use of what they said, seems unimportant by comparison.
You would take a course given by Einstein, wouldn’t you, even if you
didn’t understand physics? That is the attitude.

This attitude works at MIT. But it fails miserably at lesser schools.

I took advanced calculus from a superstar when I was an under-
graduate. I didn’t understand anything. I was a math major, but that
course caused me to lose interest in math and start thinking about
other things. I went to see this superstar and asked him for advice. We
had a great conversation. He was a very smart guy. He pointed me in
a direction that helped me make some important decisions. As a one-
on-one advisor he was great. But the system made him teach, which
really wasn’t something he could do very well.

As luck would have it, years later when I was chairman of the
Computer Science Department at Yale, he was one of my faculty. So,
in a sense he wound up working for me (to the extent that any faculty
member actually works for the chair, which is really not the case).

He was a great man. He inspired many a graduate student to be-
come a professor. He was fun to talk to. But he couldn't teach at all.
At Yale we made sure that he taught only specialty courses, which was
fine with him. What he was doing teaching advanced calculus that year
long ago is anybody’s guess. My guess is that as he was the chairman of
the Math Department at the time, either he got stuck with it because
there was nobody else or he was trying to prove a point in order to in-
duce senior faculty to come down from on high and teach the basics.

Either way it was a terrible idea.

Prestigious universities that recruit superstars are not, at the same
time, recruiting teachers. They are just hoping someone can and will
teach. But no one cares that much.

Tonce had dinner with a man who was on the Board of Trustees of
the University of Hlinois. I asked him how he liked being on the board

agents were to be assigned. All it had discovered was the history of the preparations for a major
espionage revival. It now knew that the SVR had installed plumbing in America that one or more
agents in this network had been activated to handle a possible recruit in the NSA. But without
anyone left in the sleeper network to follow and without an inside source in the SVR, it had no
further avenues to fruitfully pursue. The revelation of the sleeper agents had little, if any, other
intelligence value.

The NSA’s own security investigation turned up no evidence of a leak at Fort Meade in 2010.
The absence of evidence of a penetration in a security investigation is not in itself evidence of the
absence of a penetration. The Russian intelligence service had demonstrated in the past it was
well-schooled in covering its tracks in operations against US communications intelligence. For
example, CIA counterintelligence had learned from a KGB defector in the early 1960s that
Russian intelligence had penetrated the cipher room at the US Embassy in Moscow and, because
of this operation, the KGB was able to decipher crucial communications. Even so, it failed to find
either the perpetrator or any evidence of his existence for more than a half century. The operation
was only definitively revealed by Russian spymaster Sergey Kondrashev in 2007. Tennent
Bagley, who headed the CIA’s Soviet Bloc counterintelligence at the time, late wrote in his book
that the ability of Russian intelligence to conceal this penetration for more than a half century
“broke the record for secret keeping.”

This Russian ability to penetrate US intelligence was not entirely defeated by America’s
implementation of more sophisticated security procedures, such as the polygraph examination and
extensive background checks. In 1995, only 10 years before Snowden joined it, the CIA's
inspector general completed a study of the KGB’s use of false defectors to mislead the US
government from the end of the Cold War in late 1980s through the mid-1990s. It found Russia
had dispatched at least half-dozen double agents who provided misleading information to their
CIA case officers. Because the KGB operation went undetected for nearly a decade, the
disinformation prepared in Moscow had been incorporated into reports, which had a distinctive
blue stripe to signify their importance, had been provided to the three American Presidents,
Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Even more shocking, in tracing the path of
this disinformation, the Inspector General found that the senior CIA officers responsible for these
reports had known that some of their sources for this information were controlled by Russian
intelligence,” yet they did not inform the President and officials receiving the blue-striped reports,
that they had included Russian misinformation. What CIA Director John Deutch called an
inexcusable lapse also reflected a form of institutional willful blindness in US intelligence, borne
out of bureaucratic fear of career embarrassment so well described in LeCarre's spy novels.
Detecting intelligence failures has, if anything, become even more difficult in the age of the
anonymous Internet.

The NSA’s vulnerability to intelligence lapses, which became all too apparent with Snowden,
had departed America with a large selection of its most secret documents. The Snowden breach

2.2.3 The long-term real rate of interest

The long-term interest rate is found by setting setting
MRSp = e'* (9)

where i is the interest rate over delay 7. This procedure equates the MRS in fitness (the left-hand
side of the equation) with that in exchange (the right-hand side), and is justified as follows. The
argument in figure 3 shows that, in evolutionary equilibrium, the MRS in fitness must equal that
in preferences. Furthermore, in market equilibrium the MRS in preferences must equal that in
exchange. In studying equation 9, we are examining the implications of the hypothesis that both
equilibrium assumptions hold true.

As in my previous paper on time preference, I concentrate on intergenerational investments in
which the investment benefits the investor’s daughter after exactly one generation. By assumption,
the mother and daughter are affected at the same age, so that the two reproductive values in MRS;
are equal. In stationary equilibrium, the mother and daughter will also have equal wealth at this
common age, so that the marginal effects of consumption on their fertility and survival are equal as
well. Consequently, the right-most fraction in equation 8 equals unity, and MRS = e’ /r, where
r = 1/2 (since the two individuals are mother and daughter), and 7 equals the generation length,
T.. Equation 9 becomes 2e° = e*”, or

i= (In2)/T +p (10)

The relevant rate of population growth is not the current one, but some sort of average rate over re-
cent evolutionary history. Since evolutionary changes are usually slow, the last couple of centuries
of rapid growth have probably had no large effect. Prior to that, o must on average have been near
zero. Thus, equation 10 suggests that 1 ~ (In2)/T. The generation time T’ is usually a little less

the NSA “to wiretap anyone, even the president,” the press largely
accepted his claims as established facts. As for American surveillance,
he declared, “I don’t want to live in a society that does those sorts of
things.”

The Guardian story accompanying the video carried the headline
“Edward Snowden: The Whistleblower Behind the NSA Surveil-
lance Revelations.” Overnight, Snowden became a global celebrity
and, to much of the world, a hero.

The next morning he packed his belongings into a backpack and
moved, without notifying the front desk, to another room Poitras
had rented at the Mira. Complicated schemes, especially when they
involve transferring state secrets to unauthorized parties in a for-
eign country, do not necessarily go as planned. That was true of
Snowden’s escape plan. Snowden had no plan to stay put and face
the music. On the morning of June 10, though, there was apparently
a problem. Robert Tibbo and Jonathan Man, the lawyers who, along
with Albert Ho, had been retained for Snowden by an unidentified
party, received an emergency phone call early in the morning tell-

© ing them to help Snowden move to a safe location. Although Tibbo ©
would not identify the person who had called, the message had been
relayed to Man and him through Ho’s office. When Tibbo called
Snowden offering to help him move, Snowden told him, “I can make
myself unrecognizable.”

Tibbo and Man immediately proceeded to the mall adjacent to
the Mira hotel, where they met Snowden. After he signed a docu-
ment appointing Ho’s law firm as his “legal adviser,” the three of
them slipped out via the mall exit. Tibbo and Man planned to move
Snowden to the apartments of refugees who were their clients.

Snowden’s credit card had been frozen, so it is not clear who
paid his sizable hotel bill. According to hotel records, it was paid
by another credit card. Poitras, who had taken a room at the hotel,
might have used her own credit card, or Snowden might have had
another benefactor in Hong Kong. In any case, the lawyers escorted
Snowden to a prearranged residence.

“T am in a safe house for now,” Snowden wrote to Greenwald on
June 11. The situation might not have been totally under his control,
because he added, “But I have no idea how safe it is.”

places, and rated their imagined experience. Those on L-dopa felt they would be much happier, revealing
the power of dopamine to cause changes in our experience of reward. Complimenting these experimental
results are studies showing that genetic variation in the expression of dopamine in humans are closely tied
to impulsive behaviors and behavioral disorders. Thus, individuals with genetic variants that result in
higher levels of dopamine are more likely to engage in compulsive gambling and eating, leading to
addictions. The anticipation of heightened pleasure leads these gamblers, eaters, and abusers to want
more and more.

This work shows that dopamine is necessary for monitoring and guiding our desire for reward,
with evidence of individual differences that start with our biology. This is a highly adaptive system. But
changes in dopamine can also cause our desire for reward to runaway, like a brakeless trolley. This is a
highly maladaptive process. This flip between adaptive and maladaptive that we see within the
dopaminergic system is, by now, a familiar brain routine. It provides, I believe, the means to explain all
manners of excess, from the desire for food and money to drugs and violence.

Obesity and drug addiction are disorders of excess. They are disorders of insatiable desire. There
are many paths to obesity and addiction, but all ultimately point to changes in the reward system. In
humans born with deficient levels of the hormone leptin, overeating and obesity are common outcomes.
When these individuals view images of food during a brain scanning session, they show lower levels of
activity in the striatum than non-leptin deficient individuals. The striatum 1s an area that is rich in
dopamine and an essential part of the reward system. This may, at first, seem paradoxical: how could
those who eat to excess not show an excess of activity in the striatum, and thus, an over-the-top
experience of reward upon seeing food? The answer lies in studies of rodents and humans. Whether it is
obese rats or obese people, both show compulsive eating, but lower levels of expression of dopamine in
the striatum. If you silence a key dopamine gene in rats, you can quickly turn them into food junkies,
driven by an unsatisfied wanting system. Overeating, like over-drugging, turns the reward dial down.
This is an adaptive response, except when it operates in the mind of a food or drug junky. Though the
reward hits are small and unnoticeable, the wanting system remains highly motivated, triggered by the
same cues. What food and drug junkies want is more hits, but the reward system isn’t delivering. This
causes them to want even more.

What the work on obesity and addiction tell us is that independently of how people get started on
the path to fulfilling their desires, and whatever leads them to over-consume, consumption loses its luster.
The brain is smart: excess is bad and thus the reward systems turns off. But because the wanting or desire

system is independent from the reward system, and has evolved insurance against a complete shut down,

maintenance work. Even though Snowden was no longer a system
administrator, he could still perhaps befriend a system administrator
or even steal or borrow a service computer.

Whatever the NSA’s and Booz Allen’s security measures, Snowden
succeeded in getting the files. In a matter of a few weeks, he man-
aged to download hundreds of thousands of Level 3 documents to an
unsealed computer. He also took some less sensitive documents from
the administrative file (which contained mainly Level 1 documents)
at the end of April. These later acquisitions included an order from
the FISA court issued on April 25, 2013.

He had completed the operation by May 17, the last day he would
ever enter the NSA facility. He transferred the data he had amassed
on the service computer, including the lists of the computers in Rus-
sia and China that the NSA had succeeded in penetrating, onto stor-
age devices, which he later said were thumb drives. Then he coolly
walked past the security guards at the exit, who only seldom per-
formed random checks on NSA employees.

He carried out the entire operation with such brilliant stealth that

© he left few if any clues behind as to how he obtained his colleagues’ ®
passwords to multiple compartments, moved the data from many
different supposedly sealed computers to an opened service machine,
or downloaded these documents to multiple thumb drives without
arousing suspicion. The NSA would not discover the theft for fifteen
days.

His departure from Hawaii was also well prepared. Lindsay Mills
had departed that morning for a planned two-week visit to the outer
islands. This trip allowed him to pack his belongings without saying
anything to her that might be difficult for her to later explain. He
simply left a note that she could show to authorities saying that he
was away ona “business trip.” He informed Bay that he would have
to go in for epilepsy tests on the following Monday and Tuesday. If
the results weren’t good, he might have to be out even longer.

points. When such a minimal entropy person is injured and feeling helpless, their
stuckness can grow bizarre. Ruminative fixation in self-critical and persecutory
ideas extend into poisoned food anorexia, circular pacing, weight loss and middle-
of-the-night, worried insomnia. Suffused with sin, they ask forgiveness for soiling the
chair by their sitting in it or smelling up the room with their body odor.

At the high entropic extreme, the mouse orbits of the seductively dramatic,
new reality-creating hysteric includes big jumps, disorganized whorls and large and
small restless and short attention span scribbles that tend to fill up the entire screen.
The fragility of fixation at this end manifests itself in breakdown into impulsively out-
of-control and floridly dramatic displays. Their decrease in contact with reality
precipitates social chaos around them. The Montreal behavioral neurologist, Pierre
Flor-Henry, using electroencephalographic and psychological test data, described
the difference between these two extreme forms of personality expressions as the
overly dominant expressions of one or another of the /eft obsessional or right
hysteric hemispheric emotional styles. As examples, Flor-Henry said that a left half
brain depression feels like hopeless and agitated indecision and the depression of
the right brain is an experience of emptiness like homesickness. Left-brain
happiness is being exactly correct and right brain joy rushes like being especially
chosen.

The church going obsessional resonates with the sermon of the punitive
priest who invokes the tension and relief of sin and salvation. The practice can
result in a life long addiction to the transient high of this temporary forgiveness. In
other churches, the hysterical character gets spiritual respite in disassociative
visitations of the Holy Ghost and attendant signs and wonders. At Wednesday night
healing services, new hope arises from personal surrender in a floor hitting,
backward collapse called dying in the Lord. Both of these antipodal personalities
contrast with the more receptive state of in-between entropy (with enough entropy
available to form messages) which predicts more flexibility and higher potential for
undistorted information processing. Relatively style-less and ego-less people are

more open to hearing a variety of Gods in themselves and others. High alertness

Donald Trump's newly named chief strategist and senior counselor, Steve Bannon, laid 
out his global nationalist vision in unusually in-depth remarks delivered by Skype to a 
conference held inside the Vatican in the summer of 2014. 
Well before victories for Brexit and Trump seemed possible, Bannon declared there was 
a global tea party movement and praised European far-right parties like Great 
Britain's UKIP and France's National Front. Bannon also suggested that a racist 
element in far-right parties all gets kind of washed out, that the West was facing a 
crisis of capitalism after losing its Judeo-Christian foundation, and he blasted crony 
capitalists in Washington for failing to prosecute bank executives over the financial 
crisis. 
The remarks — beamed into a small conference room in a 15th-century marble palace in 
a secluded corner of the Vatican — were part of a 5o-minute Q&A during a conference 
focused on poverty hosted by the Human Dignity Institute, which BuzzFeed News 
attended as part of its coverage of the rise of Europe's religious right. The group was 
founded by Benjamin Harnwell, a longtime aide to Conservative member of the 
European Parliament Nirj Deva to promote a Christian voice in European politics. The 
group has ties to some of the most conservative factions inside the Catholic 
Church; Cardinal Raymond Burke, one of the most vocal critics of Pope Francis who 
was ousted from a senior Vatican position in 2014, is chair of the group's advisory 
board. 
BuzzFeed News originally posted a transcript beginning 90 seconds into the then-
Breitbart News chairman's remarks because microphone placement made the opening 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029042 
mostly unintelligible, but we have completed the transcript from a on 
YouTube. You can hear the whole recording at the bottom of the post. 
Here is what he said, unedited: 
Steve Bannon: Thank you very much Benjamin, and I appreciate you guys including us 
in this. We're speaking from Los Angeles today, right across the street from our 
headquarters in Los Angeles. Um. I want to talk about wealth creation and what wealth 
creation really can achieve and maybe take it in a slightly different direction, because I 
believe the world, and particularly the Judeo-Christian west, is in a crisis. And it's really 
the organizing principle of how we built Breitbart News to really be a platform to bring 
news and information to people throughout the world. Principally in the west, but we're 
expanding internationally to let people understand the depths of this crisis, and it is a 
crisis both of capitalism but really of the underpinnings of the Judeo-Christian west in 
our beliefs. 
It's ironic, I think, that we're talking today at exactly, tomorrow, roo years ago, at the 
exact moment we're talking, the assassination took place in Sarajevo of Archduke Franz 
Ferdinand that led to the end of the Victorian era and the beginning of the bloodiest 
century in mankind's history. Just to put it in perspective, with the assassination that 
took place roo years ago tomorrow in Sarajevo, the world was at total peace. There was 
trade, there was globalization, there was technological transfer, the High Church of 
England and the Catholic Church and the Christian faith was predominant throughout 
Europe of practicing Christians. Seven weeks later, I think there were 5 million men in 
uniform and within 30 days there were over a million casualties. 
That war triggered a century of barbaric — unparalleled in mankind's history — virtually 
180 to 200 million people were killed in the 20th century, and I believe that, you know, 
hundreds of years from now when they look back, we're children of that: We're children 
of that barbarity. This will be looked at almost as a new Dark Age. 
But the thing that got us out of it, the organizing principle that met this, was not just the 
heroism of our people — whether it was French resistance fighters, whether it was the 
Polish resistance fighters, or it's the young men from Kansas City or the Midwest who 
stormed the beaches of Normandy, commandos in England that fought with the Royal Air 
Force, that fought this great war, really the Judeo-Christian West versus atheists, right? 
The underlying principle is an enlightened form of capitalism, that capitalism really gave 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029043 
us the wherewithal. It kind of organized and built the materials needed to support, 
whether it's the Soviet Union, England, the United States, and eventually to take back 
continental Europe and to beat back a barbaric empire in the Far East. 
That capitalism really generated tremendous wealth. And that wealth was really 
distributed among a middle class, a rising middle class, people who come from really 
working-class environments and created what we really call a Pax Americana. It was 
many, many years and decades of peace. And I believe we've come partly offtrack in the 
years since the fall of the Soviet Union and we're starting now in the 21st century, which I 
believe, strongly, is a crisis both of our church, a crisis of our faith, a crisis of the West, a 
crisis of capitalism. 
I believe we've come partly offtrack in the 
years since the fall of the Soviet Union and 
we're starting now in the 21st century, which I 
believe, strongly, is a crisis both of our church, 
a crisis of our faith, a crisis of the West, a 
crisis of capitalism. 
And we're at the very beginning stages of a very brutal and bloody conflict, of which if the 
people in this room, the people in the church, do not bind together and really form what I 
feel is an aspect of the church militant, to really be able to not just stand with our beliefs, 
but to fight for our beliefs against this new barbarity that's starting, that will completely 
eradicate everything that we've been bequeathed over the last 2,000, 2,500 years. 
Now, what I mean by that specifically: I think that you're seeing three kinds of converging 
tendencies: One is a form of capitalism that is taken away from the underlying spiritual 
and moral foundations of Christianity and, really, Judeo-Christian belief. 
I see that every day. I'm a very practical, pragmatic capitalist. I was trained at Goldman 
Sachs, I went to Harvard Business School, I was as hard-nosed a capitalist as you get. I 
specialized in media, in investing in media companies, and it's a very, very tough 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029044 
environment. And you've had a fairly good track record. So I don't want this to kinda 
sound namby-pamby, Let's all hold hands and sing `Kumbaya' around capitalism. 
But there's a strand of capitalism today — two strands of it, that are very disturbing. 
One is state-sponsored capitalism. And that's the capitalism you see in China and Russia. 
I believe it's what Holy Father [Pope Francis] has seen for most of his life in places like 
Argentina, where you have this kind of crony capitalism of people that are involved with 
these military powers-that-be in the government, and it forms a brutal form of capitalism 
that is really about creating wealth and creating value for a very small subset of people. 
And it doesn't spread the tremendous value creation throughout broader distribution 
patterns that were seen really in the 20th century. 
The second form of capitalism that I feel is almost as disturbing, is what I call the Ayn 
Rand or the Objectivist School of libertarian capitalism. And, look, I'm a big believer in a 
lot of libertarianism. I have many many friends that's a very big part of the conservative 
movement — whether it's the UKIP movement in England, it's many of the underpinnings 
of the populist movement in Europe, and particularly in the United States. 
However, that form of capitalism is quite different when you really look at it to what I call 
the enlightened capitalism of the Judeo-Christian West. It is a capitalism that really 
looks to make people commodities, and to objectify people, and to use them almost — as 
many of the precepts of Marx — and that is a form of capitalism, particularly to a younger 
generation [that] they're really finding quite attractive. And if they don't see another 
alternative, it's going to be an alternative that they gravitate to under this kind of rubric of 
“personal freedom. 
Look at what's happening in ISIS ... look at 
the sophistication of which they've taken the 
tools of capitalism ... at what they've done 
with Twitter and Facebook. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029045 
The other tendency is an immense secularization of the West. And I know we've talked 
about secularization for a long time, but if you look at younger people, especially 
millennials under 30, the overwhelming drive of popular culture is to absolutely 
secularize this rising iteration. 
Now that call converges with something we have to face, and it's a very unpleasant topic, 
but we are in an outright war against jihadist Islamic fascism. And this war is, I think, 
metastasizing far quicker than governments can handle it. 
If you look at what's happening in ISIS, which is the Islamic State of Syria and the Levant, 
that is now currently forming the caliphate that is having a military drive on Baghdad, if 
you look at the sophistication of which they've taken the tools of capitalism. If you look at 
what they've done with Twitter and Facebook and modern ways to fundraise, and to use 
crowdsourcing to fund, besides all the access to weapons, over the last couple days they 
have had a radical program of taking kids and trying to turn them into bombers. They 
have driven 50,000 Christians out of a town near the Kurdish border. We have video that 
we're putting up later today on Breitbart where they've took 50 hostages and thrown them 
off a cliff in Iraq. 
That war is expanding and it's metastasizing to sub-Saharan Africa. We have Boko Haram 
and other groups that will eventually partner with ISIS in this global war, and it is, 
unfortunately, something that we're going to have to face, and we're going to have to face 
very quickly. 
So I think the discussion of, should we put a cap on wealth creation and distribution? It's 
something that should be at the heart of every Christian that is a capitalist — What is the 
purpose of whatever I'm doing with this wealth? What is the purpose of what I'm doing 
with the ability that God has given us, that divine providence has given us to actually be a 
creator of jobs and a creator of wealth? 
I think it really behooves all of us to really take a hard look and make sure that we are 
reinvesting that back into positive things. But also to make sure that we understand that 
we're at the very beginning stages of a global conflict, and if we do not bind together as 
partners with others in other countries that this conflict is only going to metastasize. 
They have a Twitter account up today, ISIS does, about turning the United States into a 
river of blood if it comes in and tries to defend the city of Baghdad. And trust me, that is 
going to come to Europe. That is going to come to Central Europe, it's going to come to 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029046 
Western Europe, it's going to come to the United Kingdom. And so I think we are in a 
crisis of the underpinnings of capitalism, and on top of that we're now, I believe, at the 
beginning stages of a global war against Islamic fascism. 
With all the baggage that those [right-wing] 
groups bring — and trust me, a lot of them 
bring a lot of baggage, both ethnically and 
racially— but we think that will all be worked 
through with time. 
Benjamin Harnwell, Human Dignity Institute: Thank you, Steve. That was a 
fascinating, fascinating overview. I am particularly struck by your argument, then, that in 
fact, capitalism would spread around the world based on the Judeo-Christian foundation 
is, in fact, something that can create peace through peoples rather than antagonism, 
which is often a point not sufficiently appreciated. Before I turn behind me to take a 
question — 
Bannon: One thing I want to make sure of, if you look at the leaders of capitalism at that 
time, when capitalism was I believe at its highest flower and spreading its benefits to most 
of mankind, almost all of those capitalists were strong believers in the Judeo-Christian 
West. They were either active participants in the Jewish faith, they were active 
participants in the Christians' faith, and they took their beliefs, and the underpinnings of 
their beliefs was manifested in the work they did. And I think that's incredibly important 
and something that would really become unmoored. I can see this on Wall Street today — 
I can see this with the securitization of everything is that, everything is looked at as a 
securitization opportunity. People are looked at as commodities. I don't believe that our 
forefathers had that same belief. 
Harnwell: Over the course of this conference we've heard from various points of view 
regarding alleviation of poverty. We've heard from the center-left perspective, we've 
heard from the socialist perspective, we've heard from the Christian democrat, if you will, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029047 
perspective. What particularly interests me about your point of view Steve, to talk 
specifically about your work, Breitbart is very close to the tea party movement. So I'm just 
wondering whether you could tell me about if in the current flow of contemporary politics 
— first tell us a little bit about Breitbart, what the mission is, and then tell me about the 
reach that you have and then could you say a little bit about the current dynamic of what's 
going on at the moment in the States. 
Bannon: Outside of Fox News and the Drudge Report, we're the third-largest 
conservative news site and, quite frankly, we have a bigger global reach than even Fox. 
And that's why we're expanding so much internationally. 
Look, we believe — strongly — that there is a global tea party movement. We've seen that. 
We were the first group to get in and start reporting on things like UKIP and Front 
National and other center right. With all the baggage that those groups bring — and trust 
me, a lot of them bring a lot of baggage, both ethnically and racially — but we think that 
will all be worked through with time. 
The central thing that binds that all together is a center-right populist movement of really 
the middle class, the working men and women in the world who are just tired of being 
dictated to by what we call the party of Davos. A group of kind of — we're not conspiracy-
theory guys, but there's certainly — and I could see this when I worked at Goldman Sachs 
— there are people in New York that feel closer to people in London and in Berlin than 
they do to people in Kansas and in Colorado, and they have more of this elite mentality 
that they're going to dictate to everybody how the world's going to be run. 
I will tell you that the working men and women of Europe and Asia and the United States 
and Latin America don't believe that. They believe they know what's best for how they will 
comport their lives. They think they know best about how to raise their families and how 
to educate their families. So I think you're seeing a global reaction to centralized 
government, whether that government is in Beijing or that government is in Washington, 
DC, or that government is in Brussels. So we are the platform for the voice of that. 
Putin's ... very, very very intelligent. I can see this in the United States where he's 
playing very strongly to social conservatives about his message about more traditional 
values, so I think it's something that we have to be very much on guard of. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029048 
Now, with that, we are strong capitalists. And we believe in the benefits of capitalism. 
And, particularly, the harder-nosed the capitalism, the better. However, like I said, there's 
two strands of capitalism that we're quite concerned about. 
One is crony capitalism, or what we call state-controlled capitalism, and that's the big 
thing the tea party is fighting in the United States, and really the tea party's biggest fight 
is not with the left, because we're not there yet. The biggest fight the tea party has today is 
just like UKIP. UKIP's biggest fight is with the Conservative Party. 
The tea party in the United States' biggest fight is with the the Republican establishment, 
which is really a collection of crony capitalists that feel that they have a different set of 
rules of how they're going to comport themselves and how they're going to run things. 
And, quite frankly, it's the reason that the United States' financial situation is so dire, 
particularly our balance sheet. We have virtually a hundred trillion dollars of unfunded 
liabilities. That is all because you've had this kind of crony capitalism in Washington, DC. 
The rise of Breitbart is directly tied to being the voice of that center-right opposition. And, 
quite frankly, we're winning many, many victories. 
On the social conservative side, we're the voice of the anti-abortion movement, the voice 
of the traditional marriage movement, and I can tell you we're winning victory after 
victory after victory. Things are turning around as people have a voice and have a 
platform of which they can use.

Harnwell: The third-largest conservative news website is something to be extremely 
impressed by. Can you tell for the people here who aren't within the Anglosphere and they 
might not follow American domestic politics at the moment — there seems to be a 
substantial sea change going on at the moment in Middle America. And the leader of the 
majority party, Eric Cantor, was deselected a couple of weeks ago by a tea party 
candidate. What does that mean for the state of domestic politics in America at the 
moment? 
Bannon: For everybody in your audience, this is one of the most monumental — first off, 
it's the biggest election upset in the history of the American republic. Eric Cantor was the 
House majority leader and raised $10 million. He spent, between himself and outside 
groups, $8 million to hold a congressional district. He ran against a professor who was an 
evangelical Christian and a libertarian economist. He ran against a professor who raised 
in total $175,000. In fact, the bills from Eric Cantor's campaign at a elite steak house in 
Washington, DC, was over $200,000. So they spent more than $200,000 over the course 
of the campaign wining and dining fat cats at a steak house in Washington than the entire 
opposition had to run. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029050 
Now, Eric Cantor, it was a He lost 57-43, and not one — outside of Breitbart, we 
covered this for six months, day in and day out — not one news site — not Fox News, not 
Politico, no sites picked this up. And the reason that this guy won is quite simple: Middle-
class people and working-class people are tired of people like Eric Cantor who say they're 
conservative selling out their interests every day to crony capitalists. 
That center-right revolt is really a global 
revolt. I think you're going to see it in Latin 
America, I think you're going to see it in Asia, 
I think you've already seen it in India. 
And you're seeing that whether that was UKIP and Nigel Farage in the United Kingdom, 
whether it's these groups in the Low Countries in Europe, whether it's in France, there's a 
new tea party in Germany. The theme is all the same. And the theme is middle-class and 
working-class people — they're saying, Hey, I'm working harder than I've ever worked. 
I'm getting less benefits than I'm ever getting through this, I'm incurring less wealth 
myself, and I'm seeing a system of fat cats who say they're conservative and say they back 
capitalist principles, but all they're doing is binding with corporatists. Right? 
Corporatists, to garner all the benefits for themselves. 
And that center-right revolt is really a global revolt. I think you're going to see it in Latin 
America, I think you're going to see it in Asia, I think you've already seen it in India. 
Modi's great victory was very much based on these Reaganesque principles, so I think this 
is a global revolt, and we are very fortunate and proud to be the news site that is reporting 
that throughout the world. 
Harnwell: I think it's important to understand the distinction that you're drawing here 
between what can be understood as authentic, free-market capitalism as a means of 
promoting wealth that [unintelligible] involves everybody with a form of crony capitalism 
which simply benefits a certain class. And we've watched over the course of our 
conference, we've watched two video segments produced by the Acton Institute about 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029051 
how development aid is spent internationally and how that can be driven away from — it 
damages people on the ground but it also perpetuates a governing class. And the point 
that you're mentioning here, that I think that you're saying has driven almost a revolution 
movement in America, is the same phenomenon of what's going on in the developing 
world, which is a concept of government which is no longer doing what it is morally 
bound to do but has become corrupt and self-serving. So it's effectively the sa—
Bannon: It's exactly the same. Currently, if you read The Economist, you read 
the Financial Times this week, you'll see there's a relatively obscure agency in the federal 
government that is engaged in a huge fight that may lead to a government shutdown. It's 
called the Export-Import Bank. And for years, it was a bank that helped finance things 
that other banks wouldn't do. And what's happening over time is that it's metastasized to 
be a cheap form of financing to General Electric and to Boeing and to other large 
corporations. You get this financing from other places if they wanted to, but they're 
putting this onto the middle-class taxpayers to support this. 
I'm not an expert in this, but it seems that [right-wing parties] have had some aspects 
that may be anti-Semitic or racial ... My point is that over time it all gets kind of washed 
out, right? 
And the tea party is using this as an example of the cronyism. General Electric and these 
major corporations that are in bed with the federal government are not what we'd 
consider free-enterprise capitalists. We're backers of entrepreneurial capitalists. They're 
not. They're what we call corporatist. They want to have more and more monopolistic 
power and they're doing that kind of convergence with big government. And so the fight 
here — and that's why the media's been very late to this party — but the fight you're 
seeing is between entrepreneur capitalism, and the Acton Institute is a tremendous 
supporter of, and the people like the corporatists that are closer to the people like we 
think in Beijing and Moscow than they are to the entrepreneurial capitalist spirit of the 
United States. 
Harnwell: Thanks, Steve. I'm going to turn around now, as I'm sure we have some great 
questions from the floor. Who has the first question then? 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029052 
Bannon: First of all, Benjamin, I can tell you I could hardly recognize you, you're so 
cleaned up you are for the conference. 
[Laughter] 
Questioner: Hello, my name is Deborah Lubov. I'm a Vatican correspondent for Zenit 
news agency, for their English edition. I have some experience working in New York — I 
was working for PricewaterhouseCoopers auditing investment banks, one of which was 
Goldman Sachs. And considering this conference is on poverty, I'm curious — from your 
point of view especially, your experience in the investment banking world — what 
concrete measures do you think they should be doing to combat, prevent this 
phenomenon? We know that various sums of money are used in all sorts of ways and they 
do have different initiatives, but in order to concretely counter this epidemic now, what 
are your thoughts? 
For Christians, and particularly for those who believe in the underpinnings of the 
Judeo-Christian West, I don't believe that we should have a [financial] bailout. 
Bannon: That's a great question. The 2008 crisis, I think the financial crisis — which, by 
the way, I don't think we've come through — is really driven I believe by the greed, much 
of it driven by the greed of the investment banks. My old firm, Goldman Sachs — 
traditionally the best banks are leveraged 8:1. When we had the financial crisis in 2008, 
the investment banks were leveraged 35:1. Those rules had specifically been changed by a 
guy named Hank Paulson. He was secretary of Treasury. As chairman of Goldman Sachs, 
he had gone to Washington years before and asked for those changes. That made the 
banks not really investment banks, but made them hedge funds — and highly susceptible 
to changes in liquidity. And so the crisis of 2008 was, quite frankly, really never recovered 
from in the United States. It's one of the reasons last quarter you saw 2.9% negative 
growth in a quarter. So the United States economy is in very, very tough shape. 
And one of the reasons is that we've never really gone and dug down and sorted through 
the problems of 2008. Particularly the fact — think about it — not one criminal charge has 
ever been brought to any bank executive associated with 2008 crisis. And in fact, it gets 
worse. No bonuses and none of their equity was taken. So part of the prime drivers of the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029053 
wealth that they took in the 15 years leading up to the crisis was not hit at all, and I think 
that's one of the fuels of this populist revolt that we're seeing as the tea party. So I think 
there are many, many measures, particularly about getting the banks on better footing, 
making them address all the liquid assets they have. I think you need a real clean-up of 
the banks balance sheets. 
In addition, I think you really need to go back and make banks do what they do: 
Commercial banks lend money, and investment banks invest in entrepreneurs and to get 
away from this trading — you know, the hedge fund securitization, which they've all 
become basically trading operations and securitizations and not put capital back and 
really grow businesses and to grow the economy. So I think it's a whole area that just — 
and I will tell you, the underpinning of this populist revolt is the financial crisis of 2008. 
That revolt, the way that it was dealt with, the way that the people who ran the banks and 
ran the hedge funds have never really been held accountable for what they did, has fueled 
much of the anger in the tea party movement in the United States. 
Questioner: Thank you. 
Bannon: Great question. 
Questioner: Hello, Mr. Bannon. I'm Mario Fantini, a Vermonter living in Vienna, 
Austria. You began describing some of the trends you're seeing worldwide, very 
dangerous trends, worry trends. Another movement that I've been seeing grow and 
spread in Europe, unfortunately, is what can only be described as tribalist or neo-nativist 
movement — they call themselves Identitarians. These are mostly young, working-class, 
populist groups, and they're teaching self-defense classes, but also they are arguing 
against — and quite effectively, I might add — against capitalism and global financial 
institutions, etc. How do we counteract this stuff? Because they're appealing to a lot of 
young people at a very visceral level, especially with the ethnic and racial stuff. 
Bannon: I didn't hear the whole question, about the tribalist? 
One of the committees in Congress said to the Justice Department, 35 [bank] executives, 
I believe, that they should have criminal indictments against — not one of those has ever 
been followed up on. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029054 
Questioner: Very simply put, there's a growing movement among young people here in 
Europe, in France and in Austria and elsewhere, and they're arguing very effectively 
against Wall Street institutions and they're also appealing to people on an ethnic and 
racial level. And I was just wondering what you would recommend to counteract these 
movements, which are growing. 
Bannon: One of the reasons that you can understand how they're being fueled is that 
they're not seeing the benefits of capitalism. I mean particularly — and I think it's 
particularly more advanced in Europe than it is in the United States, but in the United 
States it's getting pretty advanced — is that when you have this kind of crony capitalism, 
you have a different set of rules for the people that make the rules. It's this partnership of 
big government and corporatists. I think it starts to fuel, particularly as you start to see 
negative job creation. If you go back, in fact, and look at the United States' GDP, you look 
at a bunch of Europe. If you take out government spending, you know, we've had negative 
growth on a real basis for over a decade. 
And that all trickles down to the man in the street. If you look at people's lives, and 
particularly millennials, look at people under 30 — people under 30, there's 50% really 
under employment of people in the United States, which is probably the most advanced 
economy in the West, and it gets worse in Europe. 
I think in Spain it's something like 50 or 6o% of the youth under 30 are underemployed. 
And that means the decade of their twenties, which is where you have to learn a skill, 
where you have to learn a craft, where you really start to get comfortable in your 
profession, you're taking that away from the entire generation. That's only going to fuel 
tribalism, that's only going to fuel [unintelligible]... That's why to me, it's incumbent upon 
freedom-loving people to make sure that we sort out these governments and make sure 
that we sort out particularly this crony capitalism so that the benefits become more of this 
entrepreneurial spirit and that can flow back to working-class and middle-class people. 
Because if not, we're going to pay a huge price for this. You can already start to see it. 
Questioner: I have a question, because you worked on Wall Street. What is the opinion 
there on whether they think bank bailouts are justified? Is there a Christian-centered 
[unintelligible] that they think should be bailed out? The crisis starts earlier than 2008. 
What was the precedent then? What was the feeling on Wall Street when they bailed out 
the banks? How should Christians feel about advocating or being against that? 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029055 
Bannon: I think one is about responsibility. For Christians, and particularly for those 
who believe in the underpinnings of the Judeo-Christian West, I don't believe that we 
should have a bailout. I think the bailouts in 2008 were wrong. And I think, you look in 
hindsight, it was a lot of misinformation that was presented about the bailouts of the 
banks in the West. 
And look at the [unintelligible] it. Middle-class taxpayers, people that are working-class 
people, right, people making incomes under $50,000 and $6o,000, it was the burden of 
those taxpayers, right, that bailed out the elites. And let's think about it for a second. 
Here's how capitalism metastasized, is that all the burdens put on the working-class 
people who get none of the upside. All of the upside goes to the crony capitalists. 
The bailouts were absolutely outrageous, and here's why: It bailed out a group of 
shareholders and executives who were specifically accountable. The shareholders were 
accountable for one simple reason: They allowed this to go wrong without changing 
management. And the management team of this. And we know this now from 
congressional investigations, we know it from independent investigations, this is not 
some secret conspiracy. This is kind of in plain sight. 
In fact, one of the committees in Congress said to the Justice Department 35 executives, I 
believe, that they should have criminal indictments against — not one of those has ever 
been followed up on. Because even with the Democrats, right, in power, there's a sense 
between the law firms, and the accounting firms, and the investment banks, and their 
stooges on Capitol Hill, they looked the other way. 
So you can understand why middle class people having a tough go of it making $5o or 
$60 thousand a year and see their taxes go up, and they see that their taxes are going to 
pay for government sponsored bailouts, what you've created is really a free option. You 
say to this investment banking, create a free option for bad behavior. In otherwise all the 
upside goes to the hedge funds and the investment bank, and to the crony capitalist with 
stock increases and bonus increases. And their downside is limited, because middle class 
people are going to come and bail them out with tax dollars. 
And that's what I think is fueling this populist revolt. Whether that revolt is in the 
midlands of England, or whether it's in Middle America. And I think people are fed up 
with it. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029056 
And I think that's why you're seeing — when you read the media says, tea party is losing, 
losing elections, that is all BS. The elections we don't win, we're forcing those crony 
capitalists to come and admit that they're not going to do this again. The whole narrative 
in Washington has been changed by this populist revolt that we call the grassroots of the 
tea party movement. 
And it's specifically because those bailouts were completely and totally unfair. It didn't 
make those financial institutions any stronger, and it bailed out a bunch of people — by 
the way, and these are people that have all gone to Yale, and Harvard, they went to the 
finest institutions in the West. They should have known better. 
And by the way: It's all the institutions of the accounting firms, the law firms, the 
investment banks, the consulting firms, the elite of the elite, the educated elite, they 
understood what they were getting into, forcibly took all the benefits from it and then 
look to the government, went hat in hand to the government to be bailed out. And they've 
never been held accountable today. Trust me — they are going to be held accountable. 
You're seeing this populist movement called the tea party in the United States. 
Harnwell: Okay, I think we've got time for just one or two more questions for Stephen 
K. Bannon, chairman of Breitbart Media, third-largest news organization in the States. I 
know you're a very, very busy man, so we're very grateful for the time that you've agreed 
to put aside for this, to close this conference. 
I certainly think secularism has sapped the 
strength of the Judeo-Christian West to defend 
its ideals, right? 
Bannon: I'm never too busy to share with a group that can do as much good as you guys 
can. 
Questioner: What do you think is the major threat today, to the Judeo-Christian 
Civilization? Secularism, or the Muslim world? In my humble opinion, they're just trying 
to defend themselves from our cultural invasion. Thank you. 
[Question restated by Harnwell] 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029057 
Bannon: It's a great question. I certainly think secularism has sapped the strength of the 
Judeo-Christian West to defend its ideals, right? 
If you go back to your home countries and your proponent of the defense of the Judeo-
Christian West and its tenets, often times, particularly when you deal with the elites, 
you're looked at as someone who is quite odd. So it has kind of sapped the strength. 
But I strongly believe that whatever the causes of the current drive to the caliphate was — 
and we can debate them, and people can try to deconstruct them — we have to face a very 
unpleasant fact: And that unpleasant fact is that there is a major war brewing, a war that's 
already global. It's going global in scale, and today's technology, today's media, today's 
access to weapons of mass destruction, it's going to lead to a global conflict that I believe 
has to be confronted today. Every day that we refuse to look at this as what it is, and the 
scale of it, and really the viciousness of it, will be a day where you will rue that we didn't 
act [unintelligible]. 
The way that the people who ran the banks 
and ran the hedge funds have never really been 
held accountable for what they did has fueled 
much of the anger in the tea party movement in 
the United States. 
Questioner: Thank you very much. I'm [unintelligible]. I come from Slovakia. This is 
actually the source of my two very quick questions. Thank you very much for the work 
that you do to promote the Judeo-Christian values in the world. I really appreciate it, and 
I also feel that the danger is very high. I have two minor questions, because you have 
mentioned, in terms of UKIP and Front National [unintelligible]. From the European 
perspective, listening to the language which has become more and more radical from 
these two parties, especially before the European Parliament elections, I'm just 
wondering what are your plans on how to help these partners from Europe to maybe 
focus on the value issues and not with populist? And also it goes in terms — you have 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029058 
mentioned the involvement of state in capitalism as one of the big dangers. But these two 
parties you've mentioned, they actually have close ties with Putin, who is the promoter of 
this big danger, so I'd like to know your thoughts about this and how you're going to deal 
with it. 
Bannon: Could you summarize that for me? 
Harnwell: The first question was, you'd reference the Front National and UKIP as 
having elements that are tinged with the racial aspect amidst their voter profile, and the 
questioner was asking how you intend to deal with that aspect. 
Bannon: I don't believe I said UKIP in that. I was really talking about the parties on the 
continent, Front National and other European parties. 
I'm not an expert in this, but it seems that they have had some aspects that may be anti-
Semitic or racial. By the way, even in the tea party, we have a broad movement like this, 
and we've been criticized, and they try to make the tea party as being racist, etc., which 
it's not. But there's always elements who turn up at these things, whether it's militia guys 
or whatever. Some that are fringe organizations. My point is that over time it all gets kind 
of washed out, right? People understand what pulls them together, and the people on the 
margins I think get marginalized more and more. 
I believe that you'll see this in the center-right populist movement in continental Europe. 
I've spent quite a bit of time with UKIP, and I can say to you that I've never seen anything 
at all with UKIP that even comes close to that. I think they've done a very good job of 
policing themselves to really make sure that people including the British National Front 
and others were not included in the party, and I think you've seen that also with tea party 
groups, where some people would show up and were kind of marginal members of the tea 
party, and the tea party did a great job of policing themselves early on. And I think that's 
why when you hear charges of racism against the tea party, it doesn't stick with the 
American people, because they really understand. 
I think when you look at any kind of revolution — and this is a revolution — you always 
have some groups that are disparate. I think that will all burn away over time and you'll 
see more of a mainstream center-right populist movement. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029059 
Because at the end of the day, I think that Putin and his cronies are really a 
kleptocracy, that are really an imperialist power that want to expand. 
Question: Obviously, before the European elections the two parties had a clear link to 
Putin. If one of the representatives of the dangers of capitalism is the state involvement in 
capitalism, so, I see there, also Marine Le Pen campaigning in Moscow with Putin, and 
also UKIP strongly defending Russian positions in geopolitical terms. 
[Harnwell restates, but unintelligible] 
Harnwell: These two parties have both been cultivating President Putin [unintelligible]. 
Bannon: I think it's a little bit more complicated. When Vladimir Putin, when you really 
look at some of the underpinnings of some of his beliefs today, a lot of those come from 
what I call Eurasianism; he's got an adviser who harkens back to Julius Evola and 
different writers of the early 20th century who are really the supporters of what's called 
the traditionalist movement, which really eventually metastasized into Italian fascism. A 
lot of people that are traditionalists are attracted to that. 
One of the reasons is that they believe that at least Putin is standing up for traditional 
institutions, and he's trying to do it in a form of nationalism — and I think that people, 
particularly in certain countries, want to see the sovereignty for their country, they want 
to see nationalism for their country. They don't believe in this kind of pan-European 
Union or they don't believe in the centralized government in the United States. They'd 
rather see more of a states-based entity that the founders originally set up where 
freedoms were controlled at the local level. 
You're seeing a global reaction to centralized 
government, whether that government is in 
Beijing or that government is in Washington, 
DC, or that government is in Brussels. So we 
are the platform for the voice of that. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029060 
I'm not justifying Vladimir Putin and the kleptocracy that he represents, because he 
eventually is the state capitalist of kleptocracy. However, we the Judeo-Christian West 
really have to look at what he's talking about as far as traditionalism goes — particularly 
the sense of where it supports the underpinnings of nationalism — and I happen to think 
that the individual sovereignty of a country is a good thing and a strong thing. I think 
strong countries and strong nationalist movements in countries make strong neighbors, 
and that is really the building blocks that built Western Europe and the United States, 
and I think it's what can see us forward. 
You know, Putin's been quite an interesting character. He's also very, very, very 
intelligent. I can see this in the United States where he's playing very strongly to social 
conservatives about his message about more traditional values, so I think it's something 
that we have to be very much on guard of. Because at the end of the day, I think that Putin 
and his cronies are really a kleptocracy, that are really an imperialist power that want to 
expand. However, I really believe that in this current environment, where you're facing a 
potential new caliphate that is very aggressive that is really a situation — I'm not saying 
we can put it on a back burner — but I think we have to deal with first things first. 
Questioner: One of my questions has to do with how the West should be responding to 
radical Islam. How, specifically, should we as the West respond to Jihadism without 
losing our own soul? Because we can win the war and lose ourselves at the same time. 
How should the West respond to radical Islam and not lose itself in the process? 
Bannon: From a perspective — this may be a little more militant than others. I think 
definitely you're going to need an aspect that is [unintelligible]. I believe you should take 
a very, very, very aggressive stance against radical Islam. And I realize there are other 
aspects that are not as militant and not as aggressive and that's fine. 
If you look back at the long history of the Judeo-Christian West struggle against Islam, I 
believe that our forefathers kept their stance, and I think they did the right thing. I think 
they kept it out of the world, whether it was at Vienna, or Tours, or other places... It 
bequeathed to use the great institution that is the church of the West. 
And I would ask everybody in the audience today, because you really are the movers and 
drivers and shakers and thought leaders in the Catholic Church today, is to think, when 
people 500 years from now are going to think about today, think about the actions you've 
taken — and I believe everyone associated with the church and associated with the Judeo-
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029061 
Christian West that believes in the underpinnings of that and believes in the precepts of 
that and want to see that bequeathed to other generations down the road as it was 
bequeathed to us, particularly as you're in a city like Rome, and in a place like the Vatican, 
see what's been bequeathed to us — ask yourself, 500 years from today, what are they 
going to say about me? What are they going to say about what I did at the beginning 
stages of this crisis? 
Because it is a crisis, and it's not going away. You don't have to take my word for it. All 
you have to do is read the news every day, see what's coming up, see what they're putting 
on Twitter, what they're putting on Facebook, see what's on CNN, what's on BBC. See 
what's happening, and you will see we're in a war of immense proportions. It's very easy 
to play to our baser instincts, and we can't do that. But our forefathers didn't do it either. 
And they were able to stave this off, and they were able to defeat it, and they were able to 
bequeath to us a church and a civilization that really is the flower of mankind, so I think 
it's incumbent on all of us to do what I call a gut check, to really think about what our role 
is in this battle that's before us.

But because someone like Mica, who wants so much to give, can be seriously damaged
by a partner who isn't careful to offer him space to be exactly who he is.

And, most of all, because S&M is a complex and fickle mistress. Because I knew that if
Mica expected me to be able to do that regularly, he was bound to be disappointed. His
tendencies are there, and I can learn them, but this one total catharsis depended on a
confluence of factors: there had been something close to his surface, something he'd
practically begged me to pull out, and it had been his first time.

Plus, S&M also depends on self-maintenance and reasonable expectations and respecting
our own failures. An S&M relationship will be much less stable if the people involved
can't accept imperfection.

I was scared, scared, scared that Mica believed me to be more amazing than I could ever
possibly be.

KK ok

The next day, Mica was thrilled by his scratches, and showed them off to me. I was
pleased by how he eroticized the marks -- I do that, too -- but I also felt a moment of
piercing guilt. I'm sorry,” I said. I should have been more careful, before leaving marks
like that. I should have asked.”

Mica met my eyes directly, insistently. No, he said. Don't be sorry. Last night was
amazing. You knew exactly where I needed to go.

I pushed back my fear -- he expects too much of me -- and answered quietly. I ended by
telling him, S&M can't be that, all the time. He nodded. I hoped he was listening.

Fortunately, he was. The next time we did it, Mica was slightly disappointed that it wasn't
mind-blowing -- as I knew he would be. But he dealt with it. He articulated the
disappointment to me, and he remembered that I'd warned him, and he said that he was
prepared to take things as they came. And then, lying on his side next to me, watching
me, he asked: Do you want pain?

I felt my eyes widen. I felt a spike of fear. I was already so into him. I knew that if I
allowed him to get me to subspace, there'd be no going back.

Yes, I said.

And again, that attention. In a way, sometimes, Mica's attentiveness can be strangely
inconvenient. He's almost over-attuned to my desires. Even when I tell him to close his
eyes, he can't lose himself that way; he can't make himself keep them closed. The quality
of his attention is, however, quite remarkable when he hurts me.

This is where you could take me apart, I said afterwards, as I surfaced out of that
terrible vulnerability.

Mica looked at me, rested his head on me. I just want to take care of you,” he said.

contents of the black book become public as part of several civil lawsuits.

2010

April: Flight logs obtained as part of civil lawsuits against Epstein show an
assortment of politicians, academics, celebrities, heads of state and world leaders
flying on Epstein’s jets in the early 2000s. Among them: former President Bill
Clinton, former national security adviser Sandy Berger, former Colombian President
Andrés Pastrana and lawyer Alan Dershowitz.

2011

March: Two of Epstein’s victims file a motion in federal court accusing the
government of violating their rights by failing to notify them about the plea deal and
keeping it secret. Among other things, they want the plea deal invalidated in the
hopes of sending Epstein to prison. They accuse federal prosecutors of deceiving
them with “false notification letters.”

September: U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra rejects the U.S. Attorney’s Office
argument that it was under no obligation to notify victims prior to striking a non-
prosecution agreement with Epstein because there were no federal charges filed
against him. The decision marks a victory for Epstein’s victims, but the case will
drag on for seven more years.

November: Epstein must register in New York as the highest and most dangerous
level of sex offender, despite efforts by him and the New York District Attorney’s
office to lower the classification. A Level 3 status means “high risk of repeat offense
and a threat to public safety exists,” according to the state’s guidelines.

2012

March-December: Calling himself a “celebrated philanthropist” and a “renowned
educational investor,” Epstein undertakes a public relations campaign to counter
bad press about his sexual exploits. His foundation donates millions to scientific
research and sponsors global conferences on ways to achieve world peace and save
the planet. He funds cancer and educational research projects around the country.

breaching financial covenants. As seen in Exhibit
85, Moody’s composite Liquidity Stress Index
(LSI) began to deteriorate in advance of previous
default cycles. Third, the commodity sectors of the
high yield universe—which collectively generated
a staggering 85% of last year’s defaults—are
recovering along with oil prices. Keep in mind
that the par-weighted default rate excluding
these sectors was just 0.5% last year, a fraction
of the 3.2% long-run average.” Finally, our
default model—which incorporates the leading
characteristics of the Federal Reserve’s Senior Loan

risk, given that less than 10% of existing debt
matures in the next two years. Of equal importance,
interest coverage stands near all-time highs today,
in stark contrast to the period preceding the
financial crisis (see Exhibit 87). This point is further
illustrated by Exhibit 88, which shows that today’s
high yield universe is much healthier than the pre-
crisis cohort, regardless of measure. Keep in mind
that low-rated CCC bonds represented just 8% of
high yield issuance last year, a 14-year low.

We also note that high yield may be a better
interest rate hedge than many investors realize.
Consider that during unexpected interest rate
backups in the past, high yield has generated a
positive return 69% of the time and a return that
exceeded investment grade fixed income 85%
of the time (see Exhibit 89). This last point is
important, as our high yield overweight is funded
out of investment grade fixed income.
High yield’s hedging qualities were
apparent last year, as the asset class
appreciated nearly 7% in the second
half of the year despite an increase in
Treasury yields of more than 100 basis
points. Although we assume that any
further increase in 10-year Treasury
rates this year will not be offset by high
yield spreads, this historical relationship

suggests that may be overly conservative.

4; Clear goals and intellectual challenge
5: Independence, control, and active engagement
6: Learning from students

The second is from a Michigan State website and was taken from a
book by Arthur W. Chickering and Zelda F. Gamson entitled Seven
Principles for Good Practice in Undergraduate Education.’

Principle 1: Good practice encourages student-faculty contact

Principle 2: Good practice encourages cooperation among
students

Principle 3: Good practice encourages active learning

Principle 4: Good practice gives prompt feedback

Principle 5: Good practice emphasizes time on task

Principle 6: Good practice communicates high expectations

Principle 7: Good practice respects diverse talents and ways of
learning?

Whenever I see phrases like diverse talents or ways of learning or ac-
tive learning or active engagement | am very distrustful of the advice
being offered. Active learning should mean learning by doing, but it
never does because learning by doing is very difficult to implement
in the university context (which is where this advice comes from). It
is easier to do it in Ist grade, but after a while the class has to sit still
and listen and that is not active learning no matter what the teaching
guides say. Different learning styles is usually a way of saying, “some
people are dumber than others,” which no one wants to say. What
bothers me most about these kinds of lists is that they avoid saying
what really needs to be said. It is nearly impossible to measure your
success as an effective teacher because the performance expectations
of students are almost always about test scores and very rarely about
actual production.

With this idea in mind, that effective teaching means helping stu-
dents do what it is they wanted to do and not what it is that you want-
ed them to do, I will list the suggestions I have been scattering about
in this chapter. Bear in mind that this is not meant to be a complete
list. I got this list the way you saw, by interpreting things written by
students and former employees about their own experiences.

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024018.txt,"Journal of Medicine editorial (November 2013), where Janet Woodcock, MD, the FDA’s
Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and other senior FDA staff
members as co-authors, discussed the FDA’s new breakthrough therapy designation
that can be granted to expedite the review and approval of new therapies to treat people
with serious or life threatening illnesses where inadequate treatment options exist. They
state that “The genesis of the new designation can be traced to several emerging trends
in drug discovery and development. Most notable is the rise of molecularly targeted
therapies, often paired with companion diagnostics”. The editorial goes on to say that
“Once a drug is designated as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA commits to working
particularly closely with the drug sponsor to devise the most efficient pathway for
generating additional evidence needed about safety and efficacy”. The breakthrough
therapy designation was created under FDASIA in 2012, and since that time 26
breakthrough therapy designations have been granted on 80 requests;!2

e The pharmaceutical industry’s commercial model is also improving with the shift in
focus to targeted therapeutics, as these therapies can: (a) provide significant
improvements in efficacy and safety over current standards of care; (b) offer important
clinical benefits in terms of increased life expectancy and improved quality of life; (c)
positively impact high morbidity diseases, many of which have primarily expensive, but
inadequate treatments available (e.g., cancer and autoimmune diseases); and (d)
generate compelling economic benefits to payers, even when they carry premium
pricing;

e Finally, large and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies have recognized the
inefficiency of their internal R&D efforts and have deemphasized many of their own
expensive, high risk, “blockbuster” programs. Increasingly, these companies are
“externalizing” a large portion of their R&D activity by acquiring, licensing, or
partnering with smaller biotech companies that are focused on developing the novel
targeted therapeutics mentioned above.

The Fund Managers believe the net result for investors is an improving risk-return equation for
biopharmaceutical investments, which should translate into higher returns in the sector.

Information Convergence: Information convergence investments will be the second core focus
for NLV-III, expected to comprise up to 25% of the Fund. Building on the leadership
established during the NLV-II investment period along with significant experience from past
Sprout funds, the Fund Managers will invest NLV-III in companies seeking to improve
efficiency and reduce overall costs to the healthcare system through the generation, analysis,
and application of information from research to diagnosis and delivery of care. Investments in
this sector will be at the commercial stage at the time of initial investment, or will be expected to
reach the commercial stage during the projected timeline of the investment.

Central to this opportunity is the acute structural deficit in the U.S., with healthcare liabilities

address these critical fiscal issues. Broad scale deployment of new information technology will

principle of noninterference enshrined in Article 41 of the Vienna Convention on
Diplomatic Relations. It exposed beyond the possibility of concealment what China
really thinks of noninterference. The MCA president lost his seat.

This was not the only instance of insensitive behavior by Chinese diplomats in
Malaysia. In 2015, the previous Chinese ambassador saw fit to make his way to
Kuala Lumpur’s Chinatown, where only days previously the police had to use water
cannons to disperse a potentially violent anti-Chinese demonstration. There the
Chinese ambassador delivered a speech that, among other things, pronounced

the Chinese government’s opposition to any form of racial discrimination, adding
for good measure that it would be a shame if the peace of the area were to be
disrupted by the ill-intentioned and that Beijing would not stand idly by if anything
threatened the interests of its citizens and Malaysia-China relations.

Under other circumstances, these sentiments would perhaps have passed unnoticed.
But the timing and context laid the ambassador’s remarks open to disquieting
interpretations and drew a protest from the Malaysian government. The PRC foreign
ministry spokesman defended the ambassador’s action as “normal, friendly behavior.”
Undaunted, in another speech a day later, the Chinese ambassador said, “I would like
to stress once more, overseas huagiao and huaren, no matter where you go, no matter
how many generations you are, China is forever your warm national home.”

Such behavior is not atypical in Southeast Asia. If other Chinese diplomats have
behaved more prudently in their engagement of overseas Chinese communities in
other ASEAN countries, it seems a matter of differences between individuals rather
than policy. Since such behavior is patently not in China’s interest, China may be
beginning to believe its own propaganda. President Xi’s concentration of power and
insistence on greater party control seem to have created echo chambers where Chinese
diplomats and officials probably report only what is in accordance with preexisting
beliefs, resulting in situations where instructions are blindly given and followed.

This kind of behavior is not confined to countries where there are large overseas Chinese
communities. Cultural autism or insensitivity is one of the self-created obstacles to the
smooth implementation of the BRI that China is experiencing around the world. And as
the media report on the problems, awareness spreads. This does not mean that countries
will shun working with China. But countries are going to be increasingly cautious. They
will push back when the terms of engagement are too onerous and they will seek to forge
relationships with as many other major powers as possible.

Following the Malaysian elections, China is projecting friendliness toward Malaysia. But
as with Singapore, this is a pause, not the end of the story. Since influence operations are

moment in the summit. If we cou/d find common ground, he said, Israel would
have achieved what had eluded it under Rabin, and even Ben-Gurion: “end of
conflict, and Jerusalem recognized internationally as your capital.” I told him that
the discussion with my negotiators had been moving and illuminating. “I could see
how much it weighed on everyone.” But I added that I still did not feel anything of
a similar nature, or remotely as serious, was happening on the Palestinian side. I
also said that in deciding how to proceed, I couldn’t ignore political realities back
home. I would have to get any major change in our position concerning Jerusalem
through the Knesset, even before putting a peace agreement to a referendum.

“When will you get back to me with your paper?” he asked. I said I’d try by
midnight. I also asked him whether he could delay going to the G8 summit in
Japan, for which he was due to leave Camp David on the morning of the 19. That
meant we had just one full day left. I said even if the plan was to resume our talks
afterward, I couldn’t move on Jerusalem right before we recessed. It would mean
“putting my last and best offer on the table” and running the risk of leaks in Israel
while Clinton was gone. He said that he had to go to the G8, but would try to put
off leaving for a further day. Then, he asked me to draw up a list of questions for
him to present to Arafat so that we could solidify our understanding of how far he
was ready to go for peace.

I had Shlomo get busy on the list of questions. But it took time. We reconvened
around eleven at night, to discuss both the questions and the Jerusalem package.
Though it retained Israeli sovereignty over the entirety of the Old City, it did give
the Palestinians a greater measure of control over other areas of East Jerusalem
than any Israeli government had been willing to consider in the past. Still, almost
everyone in the negotiating team could live with it, assuming it became the critical
element in a final peace. Dan Meridor, alone, remained firmly opposed, though
Elyakim Rubinstein also had some reservations. Even Dan said he understood the
importance of getting a peace agreement, if indeed it was possible, and our
readiness to discuss new proposals on Jerusalem.

When I left for Clinton’s cabin at about 1:00 am on Wednesday, I had no idea I
was about to enter the most difficult meeting — and the only real fight — I had with
him during our long effort to achieve a Middle East peace. I brought Shlomo and
Danny with me, which meant that Madeleine Albright, Dennis and Sandy Berger
stayed as well. I sensed tension in all of them, in large part, I soon discovered,
because they took exception to the more than twelve hours we had spent discussing

Adaptive Inference Control: Algorithms or heuristics for guiding PLN inference, that
cause inference to be guided differently based on the context in which the inference is taking
place, or based on aspects of the inference that are noted as it proceeds.

AGI Preschool: A virtual world or robotic scenario roughly similar to the environment
within a typical human preschool, intended for AGIs to learn in via interacting with the
environment and with other intelligent agents.

Atom: The basic entity used in OpenCog as an element for building representations. Some
Atoms directly represent patterns in the world or mind, others are components of represen-
tations. There are two kinds of Atoms: Nodes and Links.

e Atom, Frozen: See Atom, Saved
e Atom, Realized: An Atom that exists in RAM at a certain point in time.
e Atom, Saved: An Atom that has been saved to disk or other similar media, and is not

actively being processed.

Atom, Serialized: An Atom that is serialized for transmission from one software process
to another, or for saving to disk, etc.

Atom2Link: A part of OpenCogPrime

s language generation system, that transforms appropriate Atoms into words connected via
link parser link types.

Atomspace: A collection of Atoms, comprising the central part of the memory of an
OpenCog instance.

Attention: The aspect of an intelligent system’s dynamics focused on guiding which aspects
of an OpenCog system’s memory & functionality gets more computational resources at a
certain point in time

Attention Allocation: The cognitive process concerned with managing the parameters
and relationships guiding what the system pays attention to, at what points in time. This
is a term inclusive of Importance Updating and Hebbian Learning.

Attentional Currency: Short Term Importance and Long Term Importance values are
implemented in terms of two different types of artificial money, STICurrency and LTICur-
rency. Theoretically these may be converted to one another.

Attentional Focus: The Atoms in an OpenCog Atomspace whose ShortTermImportance
values lie above a critical threshold (the AttentionalFocus Boundary). The Attention Allo-
cation subsystem treats these Atoms differently. Qualitatively, these Atoms constitute the
system’s main focus of attention during a certain interval of time, i.e. it’s a moving bubble
of attention.

Attentional Memory: A system’s memory of what it’s useful to pay attention to, in what
contexts. In CogPrime this is managed by the attention allocation subsystem.

Backward Chainer: A piece of software, wrapped in a MindAgent, that carries out back-
ward chaining inference using PLN.

CIM-Dynamic: Concretely-Implemented Mind Dynamic, a term for a cognitive process
that is implemented explicitly in OpenCog (as opposed to allowed to emerge implicitly from
other dynamics). Sometimes a CIM-Dynamic will be implemented via a single MindAgent,
sometimes via a set of multiple interrelated MindAgents, occasionally by other means.
Cognition: In an OpenCog context, this is an imprecise term. Sometimes this term means
any process closely related to intelligence; but more often it’s used specifically to refer to
more abstract reasoning /learning/etc, as distinct from lower-level perception and action.
Cognitive Architecture: This refers to the logical division of an AI system like OpenCog
into interacting parts and processes representing different conceptual aspects of intelligence.

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026138.txt,"Last week Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin stated that he expects an
expanded partnership between Ukraine and NATO will lead Ukraine to a
membership in the Alliance following a path similar to that of Montenegro.

With regard to the United States, for now President Trump’s ambiguous
positioning in Russian affairs seems to have little impact on the U.S.
Administration's Ukraine policy. The Administration is expected to continue its
support for the actions of NATO, the IMF and Secretary of State Tillerson has
reaffirmed in April 2017 that the U.S. will not lift sanctions against Russia as long
President Putin does not hand Crimea back to Kiev.

In internal politics, we would expect Mr Poroshenko, the President of Ukraine, to
sign the Association Agreement, thus improving his diminishing ratings and to
win the presidential elections in 2019. In my opinion, Mr Poroshenko is also
delaying the elections in the conflict zone of Donbass, a major requirement
featured in the Minsk Agreement, in order to avoid the negation of his good
performance on the European prospect, and then, assessing the Russian conflict
situation at that point in time, to progress with the Minsk Agreement and
effectively resolve a major part of the conflict. I do not think that Crimea will ever
find its way back to Ukraine but if all other matters are resolved, a financial
settlement would be considered.

Therefore the status of “frozen conflict” in the Donbass area would remain in the
short to medium term but the economy of Ukraine has been operating for a number
of years now without the Donbass and the annexed to Russia Crimea. All growth
estimates published by various international institutes incorporate similar
assumptions.

Banking Sector

In the past 3 years there has been a clean-up by the National bank of Ukraine
(NBU) with the support of IMF mainly as well as of EBRD and IFC. The number
of banks has been reduced from 192 to 92 and there are still banks that will be
liquidated. The most drastic action was the nationalisation of Privatbank, the
biggest bank in the country (market share 17.7% by assets, 36% of deposits of
physical persons), owned by an oligarch that was posing a systemic risk to the
country’s economy and which was found to be insolvent mainly because of bad
lending practices with loans extended to related parties. However, Privatbank is
servicing 20 million customers providing to them state-of-the-art digital banking

not be considered as “sensory” (on the other hand, speech audio data would be considered
as sensory”).

Short Term Importance: A value associated with each Atom, indicating roughly the
expected utility to the system of keeping that Atom in RAM rather than saving it to disk
or deleting it. It’s possible to have multple LTI values pertaining to different time scales,
but so far practical implementation and most theory has centered on the option of a single
LTI value.

Similarity: a link type indicating the probabilistic similarity between two different Atoms.
Generically this is a combination of Intensional Similarity (similarity of properties) and
Extensional Similarity (similarity of members).

Simple Truth Value: a TruthValue involving a pair (s,d) indicating strength (e.g. proba-
bility or fuzzy set membership) and confidence d. d may be replaced by other options such
as a count n or a weight of evidence w.

e Simulation World: See Internal Simulation World

e SMEPH (Self-Modifying Evolving Probabilistic Hypergraphs): a style of modeling
systems, in which each system is associated with a derived hypergraph

SMEPH Edge: A link ina SMEPH derived hypergraph, indicating an empirically observed
relationship (e.g. inheritance or similarity) between two

SMEPH Vertex: A node in a SMEPH derived hypergraph representing a system, indicat-
ing a collection of system states empirically observed to arise in conjunction with the same
external stimuli

Spatial Inference: PLN reasoning including Atoms that explicitly reference spatial rela-
tionships

Spatiotemporal Inference: PLN reasoning including Atoms that explicitly reference spa-
tial and temporal relationships

e STI: Shorthand for Short Term Importance

e Strength: The main component of a TruthValue object, lying in the interval [0,1], refer-
ring either to a probability (in cases like InheritanceLink, SimilarityLink, EquivalenceLink,
ImplicationLink, etc.) or a fuzzy value (as in MemberLink, EvaluationLink).

Strong Self-Modification: This is generally used as synonymous with Self-Modification,
in a CogPrime context.

Subsymbolic: Involving processing of data using elements that have no correspondence to
natural language terms, nor abstract concepts; and that are not naturally interpreted as
symbolically “standing for’ other things. Often used to refer to processes such as perception
processing or motor control, which are concerned with entities like pixels or commands like
“rotate servomotor 15 by 10 degrees theta and 55 degrees phi.” The distinction between
“symbolic” and subsymbolic” is conventional in the history of AI, but seems difficult to
formalize rigorously. Logic-based AI systems are typically considered “symbolic”, yet
Supercompilation: A technique for program optimization, which globally rewrites a pro-
gram into a usually very different looking program that does the same thing. A prototype
supercompiler was applied to Combo programs with successful results.

Surface Realization: The process of taking a collection of Atoms and transforming them
into a series of words in a (usually natural) language. A stage in the overall process of
language generation.

Symbol Grounding: The mapping of a symbolic term into perceptual or motoric entities
that help define the meaning of the symbolic term. For instance, the concept Cat” may be

MOTION BY MR. OCHSTEIN TO FIND THE VIOLATOR IN NON-
COMPLIANCE, ASSESS ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN THE AMOUNT
OF $150.00 AND ORDER HIM TO PAY THE $125.00 FINE

SECONDED BY MS. VAN BUREN

MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY

K. Case # 08-2520, 165 Brazilian Ave., Richard Lynn
Violation of Chapter 10, Section 10-45 (i) of the Town of Palm Beach Code of
Ordinances, if any dog attacks and causes severe injury or death to any human or
domestic animal more than once, the owner shall be required to have said dog
removed from the Town or humanely euthanized at his/her sole expense and
violation of Chapter 10, Section 10-6 of the Code which prohibits animals from
creating nuisances which are detrimental to the public safety and welfare.

(Mr. Ochstein recused himself, stating that he has a relative who has a business
relationship with Dr. Lynn and Mr. Hoffman advised Mr. Vanneck would be a
voting member in this case)

Sgt. Curtis Krauel said this case was brought to Code Enforcement through a
culmination of events spanning back over a period of 4 years. Sgt. Krauel
explained Section 10-6 of the Code and said he was going to be showing some
graphic photographs. Sgt. Krauel presented the facts of each of the documented
cases involving attacks by Duke from March 17, 2004 until May 11, 2008.

Mr. Hoffman questioned how the Code Enforcement Board came into this
procedure since the Town Council had already said Duke is a dangerous dog. Mr.
Randolph explained that Town Council does not have the authority to fine.
Originally, the police department did not issue a code enforcement board citation
but ordered the dog be removed from the Town or humanely euthanized which
was appealed to Town Council. Town Council denied the appeal. Since that time,
Dr. Lynn has refused to comply with the order of the Town Council so a citation
was issued by Code Enforcement to bring the matter before the Board to
determine whether there should be a finding of violation and at a later time,
whether a fine should be imposed. Mr. Randolph said it was now the jurisdiction of
the Code Enforcement Board and not the Town Council. Mr. Hoffman questioned
whether or not the Board had to determine if the dog was going to be euthanized
or removed from the Town and Mr. Randolph explained that this was not the
Board’s determination. The Board was only to determine whether or not there
had been a violation of the Town Code.

subconscious pretty well does what it is in the habit of doing. The
subconscious is a habit-driven processot.

Bad habits, as they say, are hard to break. Actually, all habits, good
or bad, are hard to break. A new swing is really hard to develop, as is a
new way of selling, or a new way of treating people, or driving a new
route home.

This is the real use of education: the creation of new habits. This
can be done in only one way. The subconscious learns in only one
way.

The subconscious learns by repeated practice.

The only teaching that can work, then, is the kind of mentoring that
helps someone execute better while they are practicing.

How is a high school football coach different from a high school
history teacher?

Before we attempt to answer this question, we need to consider
why it is an important question to consider. In general, I think most
people would agree that the behavior of these two types of teachers is
likely to be quite different. In our mind’s eye, we see images of yelling
and crude behavior versus refined lecture and discussion. But let’s get
beyond the superficial stereotypes and think about what they teach
rather than their style of teaching it.

The history teacher at his worst teaches facts, and at his best teach-
es careful analysis of sources of facts.

The football coach at his worst teaches that someone could never
possibly do something, and at his best coaches someone to do some-
thing better.

The history teacher teaches the conscious. The football coach
teaches the subconscious.

This makes sense if we view education (in school) as a conscious
affair. It certainly seems to be a conscious affair. We discuss history,
we don’t do history. And, it makes sense in football since the coach
doesn’t need players who can discuss football—he needs players who
can execute.

It begins to make less sense when we consider how the conscious
and the subconscious interact.

As long as we see ourselves as rational beings who can think logi-
cally and make carefully reasoned decisions about our daily lives,
then education indeed should be about the promotion of reasoned

make some inroads into the mainstream German press. China Daily’s advertisement
supplement, China Watch, is published in only one daily, after readers protested its
inclusion in another paper. In 2017, China’s state-run Xinhua News Agency partnered
with a German firm, the German Television News Agency or DFA, to provide soft
features about how important China is to Germany. Called Nihao Deutschland, the
program has been criticized as propaganda in the mainstream German press.*

Reaction

It is in business, the one area of tangible Chinese influence efforts, where pushback
has begun in Germany. Chancellor Merkel and French president Emmanuel Macron
have initiated discussions with businesses and the EU Commission on ways to
establish stricter investment screening procedures and to push for more reciprocity for
European firms in China. In April 2018, the second chamber of the German parliament
(representing the federal states) passed a resolution to lower the threshold at which the
government may intervene in foreign direct investment (FDI) projects in Germany.

The measure was Clearly targeted at China. As for the EU, the German government has
supported language that criticizes the BRI concept for hampering free trade and putting
Chinese companies at an advantage.°*

Conclusion

Many of the coercive actions documented here are for the most part measures one
might imagine German diplomats abroad also adopting. What raises questions are

the size of China’s activities and its objectives. China can wield massive resources in
pushing its public diplomacy agenda. This can turn German and European partners
into pawns. The outsize dimension of China’s influence efforts can render them
improper or even illegitimate. China’s efforts on the investment side often involve
draining technical know-how from German firms. On the political side, its support of
Central European countries has been carried out with the aim of dividing the primary
political organization of Europe, the EU. Neither of these can be regarded as proper and
legitimate behavior between states.

The risk of Chinese interference in Germany is serious in the medium to long term,
even though so far it is mainly an indirect one and German society by and large has
proven sufficiently resilient. A preliminary recommendation on how to prevent the
problem from becoming more serious would be to focus on more cohesion, exchange,
and transparency among countries concerned, first of all within the EU. This will

take time and effort, considering that some countries in Europe (such as a few Eastern
European nations along with Greece) hope to use their support of China’s political or
technological goals to lure Chinese investment. Still, as a leader of Europe, Germany—
along with France—needs to initiate a broad-based discussion among the public and

1990), avoidance of guilt (Cain, Dana, & Newman, 2014; Dana, Cain, & Dawes,
2006; DellaVigna, List, & Malmendier, 2012), anticipation of reputational benefits
or reciprocity (as Plato’s Glaucon suggests, when he proffers that even a pious man
would do evil if given a ring that makes him invisible; Trivers, 1971). At the extreme,
this amounts to asking if saintly individuals such as Gandhi or Mother Teresa were
motivated thus, or if they were “authentic” altruists who did good without anticipat-
ing any reward and would be altruistic even in the absence of such rewards.
Certainly, religions advocate doing good for the “right” reasons. In the Gospel of
Matthew, Chapter 6, Jesus advocates, “Be careful not to practice your righteousness
in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your
Father in heaven,’ after which he adds, “But when you give to the needy, do not let
your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in
secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.”

The Envelope Game suggests authentic altruism is indeed possible: By focusing
entirely on the benefits to others and ignoring the benefits to themselves, authentic
altruists are trusted more, and the benefits from this trust outweigh the risk of, for
example, dying a martyr’s death. Moreover, this model helps explain why we think
so highly of authentic altruists, as compared to others who do good, but with an
ulterior motive (consider, as an example, the mockery Sean Penn has faced for
showing up at disaster sites such as Haiti and Katrina with a photographer in tow).

Principles. Why do we like people who are “principled” and not those who are
“strategic”? For example, we trust candidates for political office whose policies are
the result of their convictions and are consistent over time and distrust those whose
policies are carefully constructed in consultation with their pollsters and who “flip-
flop” in response to public opinion (as caricatured by the infamous 2004 Republican
presidential campaign television ad showing John Kerry windsurfing and tacking
from one direction to another). CWOL offers the following potential explanation.
Someone who is strategic considers the costs and benefits to themselves of every
decision and will defect when faced with a large temptation, whereas someone who
is guided by principles is less sensitive to the costs and benefits are to themselves
and thus less likely to defect. Imagine our flip-flopping politician was once against
gay marriage but supports it now that it is popular. This indicates the politician is
unlikely to fight for the cause if it later becomes unpopular with constituents or risks
losing a big donor. Moreover, this model may help explain why ideologues that are
wholly devoted to a cause (e.g., Hitler, Martin Luther King, and Gandhi) are able to
attract so many followers.

Don’t Use People. Recall Kant’s second formulation of the categorical imperative:
“Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or
in the person of any other, never simply as a means but always at the same time as
an end.” In thinking this through, let’s again consider dwarf tossing. Many see it as
a violation of dwarfs’ basic dignity to use them as a means for amusement, even
though they willingly engage in the activity for economic gain. Our aversion to
using people may explain many important aspects of our moral intuitions, such as

In fact, recent testimony of several alleged “victims” contradicts claims made by federal
prosecutors during the negotiations of a deferred prosecution agreement. The consistent
representations of key Government witnesses (such as Tatum Miller, Brittany Beale, Saige
Gonzalez, and Jennifer Laduke) confirm the following critical points: First, there was no
communication, telephonic or otherwise, that meets the requirements of § 2422(b). For instance, |
Ms. Gonzalez confirmed that Mr. Epstein never emailed, text-messaged, or used any facility of
interstate commerce whatsoever, before or after her one (and only) visit to his home. Gonzalez
Tr: (deposition) at 30. Second, the women who testified admitted that they Hed to Mr. Epstein
about their age in order to gain admittance into his home. Indeed, the women who brought their
underage friends to Mr. Epstein testified that they would counsel their friends to lie about their
ages as well. Ms. Miller stated the following: “I would tell my girlfriends just like Carolyn
approached me. Make sure you tell him you’re 18. Well, these girls that I brought, I know that
they were 18 or 19 or 20. And the girls that 1 didn’t know and I don’t know if they were lying or
not, I would say make sure that you tell him you're 18.” Miller Tr. at 22. Third, there was no
routine or habit of improper communication expressing an intent to transform a massage into an
iliegal sexual act, In fact, there was often no sexual activity at all during the massage. Ms.
Miller testified that “[s]ometimes [Mr. Epstein] just wanted his feet massaged. Sometimes he
just wanted a back massage.” Miller Tr. at 19. Jennifer Laduke also stated that Mr. Epstein
“never touched fher] physically” and that all she did was “massage[ ] his back, his chest and his
thighs and that was it.” Laduke Tr. at 12-13. Finally, there was no force, coercion, fraud,
violence, drugs, or even alcohol present in connection with Mr. Epstein’s encounters with these
women. Ms. Beale stated that “[Mr. Epstein] never tried to force me to do anything.” Beale Tr.
A at 12. These accounts are far from the usual testimony in sex slavery, Internet stings and sex
tourism cases previously brought. The women in actuality were not younger than 16, which is
the age of consent in most of the 50 states, and the sex activity was irregular and in large part,
consisted of solo self-pleasuring.

The recent crop of civil suits brought against Mr. Epstein confirm that the plaintiffs did
not discuss any sexually-related activities with anyone prior to arriving at Mr. Epstein’s
residence. This reinforces our contention that no telephonic or Internet persuasion, inducement,
enticement or coercion of a minor, or of any other individual, occurred. In addition, Mr. Jeffrey
Herman, the former law partner of one of the federal prosecutors involved in this matter and the
attorney for most of the civil complainants (as described in detail below), was quoted in the Palm
Beach Post as saying that “it doesn’t matter” that his clients lied about their ages and told Mr.
Epstein that they were 18 or 19.

Not only is a federal prosecution of this matter unwarranted, but the irregularity of
conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the deferred prosecution agreement are
beyond any reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities. The list of
improprieties includes, but is not limited to, the following facts: |

June: The grand jury, after hearing from only one girl, returns an indictment of one
count of solicitation of prostitution. The charge does not reflect that the victim in
question and others were minors.

July: Epstein’s powerhouse legal team tries to negotiate a deal with the State
Attorney’s Office. Lawyers discuss a deferred prosecution in which Epstein would
enter a pretrial intervention program and serve no jail time.

“What ever happened to Avi?” he asked.
I continued the put on: “We don’t talk about him in our family. He came to no good.”

Showing no surprise, my questioner replied: “I knew he would come to no good. He was such a
bad kid in high school.”

I’m sure some of my critics would agree that I came to “no good,” but at least by objective
standards I’ve exceeded the expectations my high school teachers and principal had for me. None
of them thought I was “college material.”

This assessment was recently confirmed by a classmate who I encountered in Florida. We had
been friends during our first two years in high school and then, quite suddenly, his parents moved
to a different city and I had no contact with him for nearly 60 years. When we first spoke on the
phone, I asked him what he had done after leaving Talmudical Academy in Brooklyn. He told me
had had moved away and then come back to New York City for college. When I told him that I
had attended Brooklyn College and then law school, he seemed surprised. I suspect that he too,
along with others of my classmates, didn’t think I was “college material.”

The only successful part of my high school career, other than my debating, was making the varsity
basketball team. Though I was never a starter (except when one or two of the starters were sick),
I did manage to accompany my team to Madison Square Garden for the inter-Yeshiva finals. I
shared a locker with Dolph Schayes, (who, you know was born before 1933, since after that no
Jewish boy was ever again named Adolph) whose team, the Syracuse Nationals, was playing
against the N.Y. Knicks in the main event to which our game was a preliminary. One of the
people on the opposing team was a kid even shorter than me named Ralph Lipschitz. He
eventually decided that to make it in the fashion business he would have to change his name. So
Lipschitz became Lauren.

All of the teams we played against in our league were Jewish high schools, but some were much
more orthodox than we were. We did not wear yarmulkes when we played, but some of our
opponents did. They believed that it was improper to walk more than four steps without wearing
a yarmulke. In one game, one of my opponents stole a ball from me and had a open lane to the
basket. He was very fast and so I had no hope of catching him. Instead I grabbed the yarmulke
off the top of his head and threw it on the floor and yelled, “You can’t go more than four steps.”
He stopped, shot the ball and missed. I got a technical foul, which was well deserved. Ifthe Anti-
Defamation League had heard about my actions it might well have qualified as an anti-Semitic
incident, but all’s fair in love and basketball.

Basketball was not our only passion. We all loved baseball, especially since Ebbets Field was
located four blocks from our high school. The morning recess generally coincided with the time
when several of the players walked past our school to the stadium. Remember that these players
were working stiffs being paid low salaries and generally taking public transportation to and from
the games. We would wait for them to pass school and walk with them to Ebbets Field. I got to
know several of the players, including Carl Furillo, Pee Wee Reese, Gene Hermansky, Gil Hodges

regional power.

There are plenty of reasons, however, to dismiss the visit as just show. Mr
Ahmadinejad is a lame duck, banned by the constitution from running for
a third term in the June elections. As Iran moves into a period of war
economy under the pressure of sanctions designed to curb its nuclear
programme, Mr Ahmadinejad is engaged in a furious struggle to ensure
that his rival, the parliamentary speaker, Ali Larijani, does not succeed
him. The corruption allegations levelled by Mr Ahmadinejad against the
Larijani family are deeply damaging to the Iranian regime.

Mr Morsi, meanwhile, has little to show Egyptians that he has improved
their lot. Cairo is the scene of near-constant street battles and the economy
is tanking. Egypt's currency reserves have just sunk to $13.6 billion (Dh50
billion), below the critical level needed to cover three months of imports.
The country is staring bankruptcy in the face, but cannot access
emergency funds from the International Monetary Fund without
implementing unpopular reforms that would further raise social tensions.

Both leaders need to show that they have friends abroad. The reality is a
little different. Egypt and Iran appear to be divided by the Syria conflict,
which is symptomatic of the wider split between the Sunni Muslim
powers, led by Saudi Arabia, and Iran's faltering axis of resistance that,
with Syria in play and Hamas having defected, now looks increasingly like
a Shia Muslim axis.

If we look more closely, then the story of Egypt resuming its role as a
regional power looks premature. At this stage, Egypt is trying to find some
space to manoeuvre between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Given that Saudi
Arabia has the money that Egypt needs, and Washington has a lock on the
actions of the IMF, that space is limited.

But what does Washington think? Not very much at the moment. With
President Barack Obama's second term team still being assembled, it is not
surprising that there is something of a vacuum in Middle East policy. But
the issue 1s deeper than that. The Obama administration has declared it

Investment Risks. Risks vary by

the type of investment. For example,
investments that involve futures, equity
swaps, and other derivatives, as well
as non-investment grade securities,
give rise to substantial risk and are not
available to or suitable for all investors.
We have described some of the risks
associated with certain investments
below. Additional information regarding
risks may be available in the materials
provided in connection with specific
investments. You should not enter into
a transaction or make an investment
unless you understand the terms of

the transaction or investment and the
nature and extent of the associated
risks. You should also be satisfied that
the investment is appropriate for you in
light of your circumstances and financial
condition.

Altemative investments. Alternative
investments may involve a substantial
degree of risk, including the risk of total
loss of an investor's capital and the use
of leverage, and therefore may not be
appropriate for all investors. Private
equity, private real estate, hedge funds
and other alternative investments
structured as private investmen
funds are subject to less regulation

than other types of pooled vehicles

and liquidity may be limited. Investors

in private investment funds should
review the Offering Memorandum,

the Subscription Agreement and any
other applicable disclosures for risks
and potential conflicts of interest.
Terms and conditions governing private
investments are contained in the
applicable offering documents, which
also include information regarding the
liquidity of such investments, which may
be limited.

Commodities. Commodity investments
may be less liquid and more volatile than
other investments. The risk of loss in
trading commodities can be substantial
due, but not limited to, volatile political,
market and economic conditions. An
investor's returns may change radically
at any time since commodities are
subject, by nature, to abrupt changes

in price. Commodity prices are volatile
ecause they respond to many
unpredictable factors including weather,
abor strikes, inflation, foreign exchange
rates, etc. In an individual account,
ecause your position is leveraged, a
small move against your position may
result in a large loss. Losses may be
arger than your initial deposit. Investors
should carefully consider the inherent
risk of such an investment in light of
heir experience, objectives, financial
resources and other circumstances. No
representation is made regarding the
suitability of commodity investments.

Currencies. Currency exchange rates
can be extremely volatile, particularly
during times of political or economic
uncertainty. There is a risk of loss when
an investor as exposure to foreign
currency or are in foreign currency
traded investments.

Emerging Markets and Growth Markets.
Investing in the securities of issuers in
emerging markets and growth markets
involves certain considerations,
including: political and economic
conditions, the potential difficulty

of repatriating funds or enforcing
contractual or other legal rights, and
the small size of the securities markets
in such countries coupled with a low
volume of trading, resulting in potential
lack of liquidity and in price volatility.

Equity investments. Equity investments
are subject to market risk, which means
that the value of the securities may go

up or down in respect to the prospects
of individual companies, particular
industry sectors and/or general
economic conditions. The securities of
small and mid-capitalization companies
involve greater risks than those
associated with larger, more established
companies and may be subject to more
abrupt or erratic price movements.

Fixed Income. Investments in fixed
income securities are subject to the
risks associated with debt securities
generally, including credit/default,
liquidity and interest rate risk. Any
guarantee on an investment grade bond
of a given country applies only if held

to maturity.

Non-US Securities. Investing in non-US
securities involves the risk of loss

as a result of more or less non-US
government regulation, less public
information, less liquidity and greater
volatility in the countries of domicile
of the issuers of the securities and/

or the jurisdiction in which these
securities are traded. In addition,
investors in securities such as ADRs/
GDRs, whose values are influenced by
foreign currencies, effectively assume
currency risk.

Tactical Tilts. Tactical tilts may involve
a high degree of risk. No assurance can
be made that profits will be achieved
or that substantial losses will not be
incurred. Prior to investing, investors
must determine whether a particular
tactical tiltis suitable for them.

Tax Information. Goldman Sachs does
not provide legal, tax or accounting
advice. You should obtain your own
independent tax advice based on your
particular circumstances.

of its available states. As the repertoire of ways of personal responding, log Q, is
reduced, so is the brain system’s entropy, S.

Reality constrained patterns of behavior, as in successfully adaptive
personalities, lie in some optimal in-between place between the maximal and
minimum measures of entropy. The dynamical state that is postulated to yield in-
between-valued entropies is called nonuniform hyperbolicity. This is best seen when
the values of the experimental observations are plotted in a two dimensional phase
space with each point represented by two values: along the x-axis is plotted the
value observed, along the y-axis is graphed the change in the value from the last
observation. The signatory motions of these observations plotted in phase space
are irregularly varying in rate of expansion (near by initial values are separating in
time) and contraction (greatly differing initial values are coming together in time).
Values are not fixed, rhythmically varying nor in random motion. These
nonuniformly hyperbolic motions are seen in speeded up, talking head videos
showing bursts of hand gestures and in normal neuronal activity. Silences have
widely varying lengths and bursts of hand movements and neuronal discharges are
irregular in duration and character. The statistical pattern of neuronal inter-burst
intervals is not the convergent Gaussian distribution of |.Q. or heights but the
nonconvergent, long tailed, Levy distribution of flood incidences and, according to
Mandelbrot, stock market crashes.

The labored logic and inscrutably compact mathematical formalisms of the
Nobel Prize winning physicist, Ilya Prigogine, and his Belgian school, explain the
thermodynamics of these long lasting niches of restricted variation in our personal
style as energy requiring dissipative structures. Compulsive nail biting, driven
promiscuity, readiness to be suspicious are seen as a persistence of deviations
from the maximum entropy of formless, flexible, receptive end states. The system is
trapped in possibility reduced, energy requiring, samsaric niches of what Prigogine
called minimal entropy generation. We unique and oddly shaped and entropy

leaking balloons maintain our characteristic distortions through energy-requiring,

Donald J. Trump was caught on tape bragging in vulgar terms about making sexual 
advances toward a married woman, and aggressively kissing and groping other 
women. 
The remarkable recording, unearthed by The Washington Post on Friday, was made 
in 2005 on the set of a soap opera where Mr. Trump was making a cameo 
appearance. Mr. Trump was captured on an open microphone that he apparently did 
not know was recording his conversation with Billy Bush, then the host of Access 
Hollywood, with whom he was sitting on a bus.

Many computer systems have been designed to tackle creativity. We
have already met the composer Emily Howell and Douglass Hofstadter’s
computation program. Here are two more examples: Jape and AARON,
which create jokes and art, respectively.

Jape — Joke Analysis and Production Engine — is a program created
by Graeme Ritchie and Kim Binsted. It generates puns, the sort of things
you might find in an English Christmas cracker or children’s joke book.

One of the most enlightening examples of computer creativity is
AARON - refreshingly not an acronym. His machine is depicted here
and you should look up some works on the web, such as Adam and Eve,

love isn't consent, either. If I feel sexual desire for my partner, and my body feels good
when he touches me, and I love him, yet I make it clear that I don't want to have sex right
now... then he's still violating my consent if he has sex with me. (Obviously, if I want to
say no and mean yes,” then it's my responsibility to negotiate that ahead of time and
set a safeword.)

In short: There can be pleasure, desire, and even love existing alongside real abuse.
But that doesn't mean it's not abuse. This is as true with S&M as it is with non-S&M
Sex.

I once spoke to a person who referred to himself as an abuser, who told me that he'd read
descriptions of S&M aftercare, and that he saw his own tactics within them. He told me
when he thought about it, he had always considered it to be brainwashing.

And I can see it. That's the scary part. I really can see it. I can believe that when we have
powerful S&M experiences, we tap into the same parts of our brains that could otherwise
be used for psychological manipulation and destruction. S&M shows us how to create
and utilize enormous mental vulnerability through violence... and vulnerability can
always be abused. In the literature exploring the cycle of abuse, people often write about
the reconciliation phase,” in which the abuser is all sweetness and light to their victim; I
can't help but wonder how much of the reconciliation phase could be recognized as
non-consensual aftercare. How much of an abuser's power over their victim might come
from the mental malleability that cautious S&Mers learn to respect?

This does not mean that our bodies are broken. The woman whose words I published at
the top of this article called it the cruelest of design flaws and the worst people
understand it and the most compassionate people don't. But we don't have to perceive
this as a flaw -- it's not a flaw any more than orgasms are a flaw. Some S&M instructors
compare S&M mental states to altered states, like being drunk; there's nothing wrong
with being drunk, but people should be careful with alcohol. Our bodies are instruments
with certain powers and vulnerabilities that we must respect.

This power and vulnerability is one of the biggest reasons I do the writing that I do.
Because although they're invisible, I do have a sense of the fences that FormerWildChild
talked about when she commented at Feministe: the fences that keep S&Mers from
falling into the Grand Canyon of abuse. Those invisible fences around the canyon are
constructed from self-awareness, self-esteem, respect, and consent.

Building Fences Around The Canyon

How do we build fences around the canyon? We build them by seeking to understand our
desires, and talk openly with our partners, and respect our partners’ limits. So I write
about communication and self-examination and learning to value my boundaries... and I
hope it will help people learn what it means to play at the edge, rather than falling into
the canyon.

This is scary, loaded, complicated territory. I certainly don't have all the answers. But I
have ideas on how we might begin finding answers from here.

The effectiveness of subconscious cues of observability points to a primary role for
reputations in our learned or evolved proclivities toward pro-social behavior. The
large impact of subtle cues of observability, however, calls into question alternative
explanations not based on reputations.

Explicit Requests. When we are asked directly for donations, we give more than if
we are not asked, even though no new information is conveyed by the request. In a
study of supermarket shoppers around Christmas time, researchers found that pass-
ersby were more likely to give to the Salvation Army if volunteers not only rang
their bell but explicitly asked for a donation (Andreoni, Rao, & Trachtman, 2011).
If our motive is to actually do good, or perhaps proximally to feel good by the act of
giving, we should not be impacted by an explicit request.

However, if we evolved or learned to give in order to gain rewards or avoid pun-
ishment as described above, then we ought to be more likely to give when, if we did
not give, it would be common knowledge that we had the option to give and chose
not to. The explicit request makes the denial common knowledge.

It is worth emphasizing that our evolved intuition to respond to explicit asks may
be (mis)applied to individual settings that lack social rewards. Imagine you are
approached by a Salvation Army volunteer in front of a store in a city where you are
visiting for one day only. A literal reading of the model would suggest that you
should be no more likely to respond to an explicit request. But it is more realistic to
expect that if your pro-social preferences were learned or evolved in repeated inter-
actions then applied to this new setting, you would respond in a way that is not
optimal for this particular setting and nonetheless give more when explicitly asked
Gust as our preferences for sweet and fatty foods, which evolved in an environment
where food was scarce, lead us to overeat now that food is abundant).

Avoiding Situations in Which We Are Expected to Give. In the same supermarket
study, researchers discovered that shoppers were going out of their way to exit the
store through a side door, to avoid being asked for a contribution by the Salvation
Army volunteers. In another field experiment, those who were warned in advance
that a solicitor would come to the door asking for charitable donations were more
likely to not be home. The researchers estimated that among those who gave, 50 %
would have avoided being home if warned in advance of the solicitor’s time of
arrival (DellaVigna et al., 2012). In a laboratory analog, subjects who would have
otherwise given money in a $10 dictator game were willing to pay a dollar to keep
the remaining nine dollars and prevent the recipient from knowing that a dictator
game could have been played (Dana et al. 2006). If our motive were to have an
impact, we would not pay to avoid putting ourselves in a situation where we could
have such an impact. Likewise, if our motive were to feel good by giving, we would
not pay to avoid this feeling.

In contrast, if we evolved or learned to give in order to gain rewards or avoid
punishment, then we would pay to avoid situations where we are expected to give.
Again, this would be true even if, in this particular setting, we were unlikely to actually
be punished.

know what to do with it so I tucked it under my neck to protect my new tie. One of the partners
pulled it off and said “Young man, this is a restaurant, not a barbershop.”

All first year law students at Yale are required to participate in a moot court competition. My
opponent was a classmate named Taft, one of whose ancestors was the President of the United
States and the Chief Justice; another a senator from Ohio and the third the mayor of Cincinnati. It
is fair to say at that time that Taft was one of the most prominent names in America. My mother
was convinced that I couldn’t possibly compete with a Taft and that I would be demolished in
moot court. To provide support, she and my father came up to New Haven to watch me argue. I
did fine. When my mother told my grandmother that I had beaten a Taft, she replied, “Taft?
That’s a funny name. I wonder what he changed it from?” In my neighborhood, many short
names, like many short noses, had once been longer.

In my third year, I served as editor-in-chief of the Yale Law Journal. I was the first orthodox Jew
to serve in that capacity, and there were some who doubted that this seven day a week job could
be done by a six-day a week worker. But I managed to get the job done, and at the end of the
year a few of my associate editors presented me with a mock copy of the law journal in which
every seventh page was blank.

The speaker at my law school graduation was President John F. Kennedy. He used the occasion
to make the statement about having the best of both worlds, a Harvard education and a Yale
degree. (I now have what I think is the best of both worlds, a Yale education and a Harvard
teaching job). My son Elon was a year old at graduation, and I brought him along. During
Kennedy’s speech, he started crying. A local New Haven television station caught him in the act,
and the voiceover said that Yale was always a Republican school. (I don’t think Elon has ever
voted for a Republican in his life.)

During my years at law school, I developed an interest in writing academic articles. At Brooklyn
College, I wrote a paper about the 5 Amendment. In it, I explored the history, policies and
applications of the privilege, especially in the context of legislative investigations, where many of
the battles over the scope of the 5 Amendment were then being fought. I pointed out that the
privilege had “traversed many cycles” over the years and had been “adapted to changing times and
needs,” and concluded that though we “are considering the very same constitutional phrase, we
are dealing with a completely new and hitherto unknown privilege.”

I would repeat the theme of a changing Constitution in much of my writings over the years and
would eventually write a book about the 5 Amendment. At Yale, I wrote two articles for the
law journal—one about attempted murder, the other about corporate crime—that brought me to
the attention of the faculty not only at Yale but at Harvard as well. Both schools had their eyes
out for me as a potential faculty recruit. I worked with several professors at Yale, serving as a
research assistant to Professor Guido Calabresi, Joseph Goldstein, Jay Katz, Alexander Bickel and
Telford Taylor. They each became mentors to me and I tried to follow in their very large
footsteps.

The professor who most influenced my legal thinking were Joseph Goldstein, who taught me
criminal law, but he really didn’t teach me much about the actual law; his job was to get the
students to question everything, to accept nothing and to rethink every principle of law. Some

Year of Decision: U.S. Policy toward Iran in
2013

James F. Jeffrey and Thomas Pickering

February 12, 2013 -- On February 7, 2013, James F. Jeffrey and Thomas
Pickering addressed a Policy Forum at The Washington Institute.
Ambassador Jeffrey, a former assistant to the president and deputy
national security advisor, is author of the new Institute study Moving to
Decision: U.S. Policy toward Iran. Ambassador Pickering served in
numerous key posts at home and abroad over a five-decade career,
including undersecretary of state for political affairs. The following is a
rapporteur's summary of their remarks.

JAMES F. JEFFREY

The move to decision on Iran is the most pressing and dangerous issue on
the U.S. and international agenda in 2013. The year ahead will largely
define the longstanding struggle between Washington and Tehran, and the
considerable stakes involved make it absolutely crucial that a swift and
decisive resolution be achieved. Regardless of the outcome of the nuclear
issue, however, Iran will continue to present a long-term challenge to the
United States because of clashing ideologies, conflicting foreign policy
goals, and Iran's claim to regional hegemony.

There are four likely outcomes to the nuclear issue: a unilateral Iranian
decision to halt or dramatically slow its progress toward a nuclear weapon;
a negotiated outcome, whether through the P5+1 (1.e., the five permanent
members of the UN Security Council plus Germany) or bilateral
negotiations; a military strike, as threatened by President Obama and
Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu; and an explicit or implicit
shift to containment, indicating that Washington would be prepared to
coexist with a nuclear-armed Iran.

DP: The modern era for Muslims began with Napoleon’s invasion of
Egypt in 1798. Muslims experienced a great shock at seeing how
advanced the blue-eyed peoples from the north had become. It would be
roughly analogous to the Eskimos coming down south and decimating
Westerners, who would uncomprehendingly ask in response, “Who are
these people and how are they defeating us?”

TB: So how did they respond?

DP: Muslims over the past 200 years have made many efforts to figure out
what went wrong. They have experimented with several answers. One was
to emulate liberal Europe—Britain and France—until about 1920. Another
was to emulate illiberal Europe—Germany and Russia—until about 1970.
The third was to go back to what are imagined to be the sources of Islamic
strength a millennium ago, namely the application of Islamic law. That’s
Islamism. It’s a modern phenomenon, and it’s making Muslims the center
of world unrest.

TB: But it is also creating discomfort?
DP: It has terribly deleterious effects on Muslims. Many of them are put

off by Islam. In Iran, for example, one finds a lot of alienation from Islam
as a result of the Islamist rule of the last 30-odd years.

TB: Has it happened anywhere else?

DP: One hears reports, especially from Algeria and Iraq, of Muslims
converting to Christianity. And in an unprecedented move, ex-Muslims
living in the West have organized with the goal of becoming a political
force. I believe the first such effort was the Centraal Comité voor Ex-
moslims in the Netherlands, but now it’s all over the place.

TB: Nonetheless, Islam has lasted for 1,500 years.

DP: Yes, but modern Islamism has been around only since the 1920s, and
I predict it will not last as a world-threatening force for more than a few
decades. Will Muslims leave the faith or simply stop practicing it? These
are the sort of questions I expect to be current before long.

TB: What about Islam in the United States?

and refining our position on Jerusalem. I think Clinton expected a formal offer
from us. Since I’d been guided by his request for a list of questions for Arafat,
however, that is what we came to him with. As we’d discussed, I wanted finally to
elicit some sign of whether Arafat, too, was ready to make difficult decisions.

The questions were specific. “Will you accept an agreement that stipulates the
following...” it began, and proceeded to outline the kind of peace we could accept
and still hoped for. The points included not just Jerusalem, but areas I knew would
also be sensitive for Arafat, such as the “right of return” and formal agreement to
an end of conflict. We went further than before in some areas. One of the outer
East Jerusalem neighborhoods would be under Palestinian sovereignty. The rest of
the city would remain under Israeli sovereignty, but most of the other Arab villages
would be subject to a system of Palestinian administration. The Haram al-Sharif,
the mosque complex above the wall of the Jewish temple, would be under
Palestinian “administrative and religious management.” We also suggested
“special arrangements” implying a Palestinian presence in the Old City, but again
under Israeli sovereignty. The questions envisaged eventual Palestinian control in
the Jordan Valley, with an Israeli security zone for 12 years, rather than our
proposal in pre-summit talks for 30 years. Then, explicitly, we proposed a question
to Arafat to confirm my understanding with Clinton that the “right of return”
would apply not to Israel proper, but to a Palestinian state on the West Bank and
Gaza. Finally, the document said: “I understand that such an agreement constitutes
an end of conflict.”

After he read it, the President blew up. Far from the “bottom lines” he’d
apparently hoped for, but which I’d never thought were expected at this stage, I
seemed to be retreating from ideas Shlomo and Gili had presented in their all-night
session with the Palestinians. Given the ground rules of that exercise, they’d felt
able to go beyond anything we’d actually agreed, and in some areas beyond what
they knew I could support. As a result, the list of questions assumed Israel would
keep a little more than 11 percent of the West Bank, nearly one percent more than
Shlomo had mentioned. Shlomo and Gili had also raised the possibility of up to
three of the outer Jerusalem villages coming under full Palestinian sovereignty.
“You keep us, and Arafat, waiting for 13 hours,” Clinton fumed, his face nearly
scarlet. “And you want me to present something /ess than you’ve already offered.”
He said he wouldn’t do it. “This is not real. It’s not serious.” He said that he’d
gone to Shepherdstown in search of what was supposed to be an endgame with the

story of the social nature of humankind? Our
research findings have led me to believe that
we all have made Eddington’s error in the way
we have thought about, studied, and tried to
deal with an invisible force that motivates us
to seek and maintain our connection with
others — including the loneliness one feels
when we feel important social connections are
threatened or absent. Historically, the
scientific perspective on loneliness was not
only that it was a painful and miserable state,
but that it was an aversive state with no
redeeming features. All one needs to do is to
reflect on the last time one felt terribly lonely,
and one can appreciate the seemingly self-
evident truth of this characterization. But as
Sir Arthur Eddington’s story shows us, the
obvious and intuitive can sometimes be very
misleading. It is now widely recognized that
many structures and processes of the mind
operate outside of awareness, with only the
end products sometimes reaching awareness.

Humans have evolved to seek
connections with and validation from
other minds, and these social
connections represent an important set of
invisible forces operating on our brain
and biology. The need for social
connection extends beyond kin relations
and beyond face to face relations to
include felt connections with
superorganismal entities such as teams,
political parties, nations, and God. The
unseen forces compelling these
connections can be quantified and
investigated objectively independent of
one’s spiritual beliefs. Underlying these
aspirations are selfish genes that have
produced a social brain which activates
reward regions of the brain when we
cooperate effectively with others (33) or
punish the perpetrators of social
exploitations (34), and which activates
the pain matrix in the brain when we feel
rejected by others (35). When people

feel socially isolated (i.e., lonely)
compared to when they do not feel
lonely, they are more likely not only to
perceive nonhuman objects as human-
like but to believe in the existence of
God (3/, 36). To understand the full
capacity of and forces operating on
humans, we need to appreciate not only
the memory and computational power of
the brain but its capacity for
representing, understanding, and
connecting with other individuals and
with the emergent structures, fictional
and real, that the brain can represent.
That is, we need to recognize that we
have evolved a powerful, meaning-
making social brain and a need for social
connection.

for democracies,” he continued. “I hope you understand that con-
tacting you is extremely high risk and if you are willing to agree
to the following precautions before I share more, this will not be a
waste of your time.” Further playing on her concern, he asked her to
confirm to him “that no one has ever had a copy of your private key
and that it uses a strong pass phrase.” Such precautions were neces-
sary because “your adversary is capable of one trillion guesses per
second.” That “adversary” was, as she knew from her previous film,
the NSA. At this point, she knew she was entering into a dangerous
liaison with an unknown party in pursuit of NSA secrets. She won-
dered if he might be part of a plan to entrap her or her contacts like
Assange and Appelbaum, as she noted in her diary. “Is C4 a trap?”
she asked herself, referring to her Citizen Four source. “Will he put
me in prison?”

To elude this “adversary,” Snowden stressed to Poitras that she
would have to adopt a conspiratorial frame of mind. “If the device
you store the private key and enter your pass phrase on has been

© hacked, it is trivial to decrypt our communications,” he explained. “If ©
you publish the source material, I will likely be immediately impli-
cated.” If her correspondent could be “immediately implicated,” it
meant that he was a person authorized to handle these secrets. So
Poitras knew, as early as January 2013, that she was creating an
encrypted channel for someone with access to NSA secrets who
would be incriminated by providing them to her.

The key source for Poitras’s previously referred to short video
was Binney. Like her new source, he had been authorized to handle
NSA secrets. Binney had been an NSA technical director until he
had retired in 2001. The NSA‘s domestic surveillance program that
Binney told the press about years before being interviewed in Poi-
tras’s film was called Stellarwind. It involved data mining domestic
communications and financial transactions that had been authorized
by President George W. Bush in 2001 after 9/11 as commander-in-
chief under the war powers given to him following the attacks. It
indeed led to a major exposé on domestic spying by The New York
Times in December 2005.

Binney had never provided Poitras with any NSA documents

One evening in the human neurophysiology laboratory, | was invited by Dr.
Heath to join him and several other brain scientists behind a two-way mirror to
watch an interview with Donna while electrical current was being put through her
recording electrodes. We watched and listened as a psychiatrist interviewed her
about her past. The patient was speaking about her childhood. Unseen by the
patient, the neurophysiologist, with us behind the mirror, was intermittently pushing
the button evoking brain stimulation with very low current applied to the septum. Dr.
Heath told me to listen for subtle changes or discontinuities in the flow of the on-
going conversation that he said might reflect alterations in her thoughts and
feelings. .

“The first time we were allowed to take a break from Sunday school for the
church service and | got to hear the choir and the pipe organ, | suddenly got a
feeling of happiness that | hoped would last forever. My Sunday school teacher told

psychiatrist nod silently. “When | learned about the real meaning of Christmas and
Easter, it was frightening and beautiful.”

Within a few seconds after the neurophysiologist, behind the mirror and

stimulus generator, the patient stopped talking. After a little more silence, her
interviewer encouraged her to continue,

“You were talking about how beautiful the holidays were. Tell me in what
ways?”

“| don’t want to talk about that anymore.” She blushed and looked very
uncomfortable. The neurophysiologist's hand remained on the switch. She
continued to speak with her psychiatrist.

“| have to ask you a favor and | don’t know why. | hope you don’t get upset.
The thought won't leave me alone.” She seemed embarrassed even as her body

relaxed against the back of the chair languorously.

It was not easy as people from LifeBall are very difficult. But I go it (they even now approved you - they 
needed to do a background check believe it or not! — as on that dinner will be president of Austria, Clinton etc) 
for two tickets — for you and your guest for a price that you do not need to buy a table (as they do not sell 
individual seats). 
Guy below is a good friend and he is a CEO of amFAR (amFAR has a joined dinner) — so he helped. 
The nice thing about these tickets is that they are the most VIP. It includes reception, dinner, gala and after all 
party access. 
I have the same ones (through Bill). 
I also got two additional for you but it turns out that they are not the same level so I reached to Kevin for help. 
The price is 2,500Euro per ticket (this is very reduced price as I think the regular one for this is 15K and it is 
hard to get it). They will need an email from someone from your office and name a your guest asap. 
The plan for for Vienna I am sending you with my next email!

Here is the information sheet for Jeffrey to buy tickets. Tell him to use my name and the name of Magdalena

which happens right before the ball. I hope you guys are all planning to attend the dinner as well. You can tell

decades of struggle so that “equality of rights” wouldn’t be empty
words, and so that rape, for example, would be recognized as a crime.
But giving voice to the lowly is one thing. Considering this voice as
Gospel is quite another—which can be the source of new and
dreadful injustices. Yet this is exactly what has happened with his
accuser’s charges.

And I am still asking myself how so many editorialists, so many great
consciences and, by the way, so many feminists could take it as a
given that the word of this woman—of whom we knew only what
filtered through the incomplete language of justice—was necessarily
infallible.

The truth is that we have passed from one extreme to the other. The
era when the word of the System’s victims was, on principle,
discredited has given way to one in which it is—also on principle—
attributed all prestige.

Yet I repeat: To be a victim of society is one thing, and no one doubts
that the alleged victim of the supposed rape is at least the victim of a
social order that pays its hotel maids peanuts and treats them like
livestock.

But to be the victim of aggression is another thing entirely and of an
entirely different nature. It must be established methodically,
scrupulously, and with discretion, by comparing evidence, viewpoints
and witness accounts and by avoiding the interference of emotion,
even when justified, that may motivate one and another. This is a
question of principle.

5. Finally, as I immediately emphasized, there is already a victim in
this case and that is the very principle, in the United States, of the
presumption of innocence. Soon there will be another, I mean
another victim, should it be verified that the accuser also lied about
what actually happened in this now-legendary suite at the Sofitel, and
that will be Dominique Strauss-Kahn himself. But from now on, there

broad industrialized world is aging.
According to Tharoor, the average age in
China today is around 38, whereas in
India it’s around 28. In 20 years, that gap
will be much larger. So this could be a
huge demographic dividend — “provided
that we can educate our youth — offering
vocational training to some and
university to others to equip them to take
advantage of what the 21st-century global
economy offers,” said Tharoor. “If we get
it right, India becomes the workhorse of
the world. If we get it wrong, there is
nothing worse than unemployable,
frustrated” youth.

Indeed, some of India’s disaffected youth
are turning to Maoism in rural areas. “We
have Maoists among our tribal
populations, who have not benefited from
the opportunities of modern India,”
Tharoor said. There have been violent
Maoist incidents in 165 of India’s 625
districts in recent years, as Maoists tap
into all those left out of the “Indian
dream.” So there is now a huge push here
to lure poor kids into school. India runs
the world’s biggest midday lunch
program, serving 250 million free school
lunches each day. It’s also doubled its
number of Indian Institutes of
Technology, from eight to 16, and is
planning 14 new universities for
innovation and research.

couldn’t guarantee anything. In the months ahead I would come to understand what
that meant, because it would happen again. I don’t think Arafat himself
orchestrated the violence. Maybe he couldn’t have stopped it completely. But I
have no doubt — nor did President Clinton — that he stood aside and let it happen.

Even worse — since he did have control over them — his security forces, with
arms that Israel had provided as part of Oslo, fired on our troops as they tried to
keep order. All of this, while I stood in the Knesset battling to get approval to give
him the villages. As news arrived in the chamber of gunfire just a couple of miles
away, it was not just Likud or other right-wing MKs who were furious. I certainly
was. Yet I also knew that the price of losing the vote would be the fall of the
government. We did win the vote, by a margin of eight, meaning that I now had
full authority to return the three villages. Fuming over what had happened,
however, I called President Clinton and told him I was going to delay the
handover. I was not about to return the villages under gunfire, or reward Arafat for
breaking even his existing security commitments.

That meant that prospects for serious negotiations with the Palestinians were
again on hold. But another, immutable, priority would probably have delayed any
new initiative anyway: my pledge to get our soldiers out of Lebanon within a year
of the election. I was determined to go ahead with it not just because I’d promised
Israelis to do so. It was because I knew from experience that without setting a
deadline and sticking to it, it wouldn’t happen. I had been against keeping the
security zone from the start. Over the years, many Israelis, both inside the military
and beyond, had come to accept we would be better off pulling out. It wasn’t just
the attritional loss of Israeli soldiers’ lives, but the fact that there was no obvious
point, and no obvious end, to our mission there. Especially when major tragedies
occurred — like the collision of two Israeli helicopters a couple of years earlier,
leaving scores of young soldiers dead — there was talk about a withdrawal. Yet
there was always a reason to reconsider, to put it off: a Hizbollah attack in the
security zone, accusations of weakness from right-wing politicians, or simple
caution in the kirya. The only way to get it done was to decide, and to do it.

My self-imposed deadline for the pullout was now just eight weeks away.
Hizbollah had already begun escalating pressure on our outposts in south Lebanon
with the obvious aim of making the withdrawal as difficult as possible. They were
also targeting our local surrogates, the Maronite-led South Lebanese Army militia.
I’d been meeting regularly with Shaul Mofaz, the former paratroop officer who

Top-Notch Security

M2M - Specialty Publications - April 6, 2007

M2M technology providers and system integrators often cite efficiency improvements and new
revenue opportunities as common indicators of return-on-investment. However, as more and more
customers use machine-to-machine applications to collect data, security has not only become a
top-notch priority for end users and OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) but also a highly
valued part of fostering a positive ROI.

According to IDC Corp., www.idc.com, Framingham, Mass., as devices enabling a mobile
workforce continue to shrink in size, the increased likelihood of losing devices, such as laptops,
mobile phones, BlackBerrys, has caused growing concern over the sensitive corporate information

they contain.

Few at conference get to soul of GPS shoe

Satellite tracking services were expected to be one of the big attractions at this year's big wireless
conference in Orlando, but the satellite shoe seemed to surprise most of the people walking around
the convention floor.

Many passers-by Wednesday furrowed their brows or shook their heads at what appeared to be a
silly toy for spoiled yuppie joggers. Only a few investigated long enough to realize that the GPS
