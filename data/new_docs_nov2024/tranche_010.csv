CHAPTER IV U.S. Legal Landscape

U.S. Department of Justice: The Cole Memo

A memorandum published by the DOJ in August 2013 (Cole Memo) provides guidance to DOJ attor-
neys and federal law enforcement about prosecuting cannabis-related federal offenses. The Cole Memo
asserts that marijuana is a dangerous drug, that illegal distribution of marijuana is a serious crime which
provides revenue to criminal enterprises and that the DOJ is committed to enforcing marijuana-related
violations of federal law. The Cole Memo also notes, however, that the DOJ is committed to using
its limited investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most
effective, consistent and rational way.

The Cole Memo guides DOJ attorneys and federal law enforcement to focus on the following
eight enforcement priorities when considering prosecutions for marijuana-related CSA violations (and
also, according to a Cole Memo update issued in February 2014, when considering prosecutions for
marijuana-related violations of the federal money laundering statute, the unlicensed money transmitter
statute and the Bank Secrecy Act):

1. Preventing distribution of marijuana to minors.

2. Preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises, gangs and
cartels.

3. Preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some
form to other states.

4. Preventing state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the
trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity.

5. Preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana.

6. Preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences
associated with marijuana use.

7. Preventing the growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and
environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands.

8. Preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property.

The Cole Memo notes that whether marijuana-related conduct implicates any of these enforce-
ment priorities should be a primary question in considering prosecution and that in states with legal-
ized marijuana and effective regulatory systems, conduct in compliance with state law is less likely to
threaten these priorities.

The Cole Memo has provided some comfort to those operating state-legal cannabis businesses that
do not interfere with the enumerated enforcement priorities. However, the Cole Memo merely reflects
internal guidance within the DOJ and does not create a legal defense for any violation of federal law.

During the January 2017 Senate confirmation hearings for current U.S. Attorney General Jeff
Sessions, in a discussion about the enforcement priorities outlined in the Cole Memo, Mr. Sessions
acknowledged the “problem of resources for the federal government” and stated that he thought some
of the enforcement priorities were “truly valuable in evaluating cases,” but he also stated that he would
not commit to never enforcing federal law.

2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *890

Casey, the victim told the prosecutor that she wished to be heard in opposition to a plea. The prosecutor refused to convey that
information to the court and the trial judge accepted the plea. When the issue reached the Utah Supreme Court, the court
concluded that the prosecutor had an ethical obligation as an officer of the court to convey that information to the judge:

Prosecutors must convey such requests [to be heard] because they are obligated to alert the court when they know that the court
lacks relevant information. This duty, which is incumbent upon all attorneys, is magnified for prosecutors because, as our case
law has repeatedly noted, prosecutors have unique responsibilities... . The prosecutor is the representative not of an ordinary
party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern
at all; and whose interest ... in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win ... but that justice shall be done. !73

Applying the reasoning of Casey to analogous rights in the CVRA, federal prosecutors must, as officers of the court, convey a
victim's request to be heard regarding a plea. Indeed, the prosecutor should convey not only that request to be heard but also the
fact that the victim has an objection to the plea. In deciding whether to accept a plea, the court must consider the public interest.
'4 As the Courts of Appeals have explained, Rule 11 also contemplates the rejection of a negotiated plea when the district
court believes that bargain is too lenient, or otherwise not in the public interest. '7> When the prosecutor is aware of an
objection from a keenly interested member of the public - the victim - the court should not be left in the dark about it, as
provided in my proposed rule. 17°

[*891] Rules 12.1 and 12.3 - Victim Addresses and Phone Numbers Not Disclosed for Alibi and Public-Authority Defense
Purposes The Proposals:

Rule 12.1 currently requires the government to disclose the address and telephone numbers of any witness, including any
victim, that it plans to use to disprove a defendant's alibi. I proposed amending Rule 12.1 to protect the victim's privacy, by
excluding their addresses and telephone numbers from this requirement as follows:

(a) Government's Request for Notice and Defendant's Response.

(1) Government's Request. An attorney for the government may request in writing that the defendant notify an attorney for the
government of any intended alibi defense. The request must state the time, date, and place of the alleged offense.

(2) Defendant's Response. Within 10 days after the request, or at some other time the court sets, the defendant must serve
written notice on an attorney for the government of any intended alibi defense. The defendant's notice must state:

(A) each specific place where the defendant claims to have been at the time of the alleged offense;

(B) the name, address, and telephone number of each alibi witness and the address and telephone number of each witness (other

than a victim) on whom the defendant intends to rely. !77

(b) Disclosing Government Witnesses.

® Casey, 2002 UT 29, P 32, 44 P.3d at 764 (internal citations omitted) (quoting State v. Emmett, 839 P.2d 781, 787 (Utah 1992)).

™ See, e.g., United States v. Bean, 564 F.2d 700,704 (5th Cir. 1977) (stating that discretion of the court includes license to reject plea deals
that are against public interest).

7 United States v. Carrigan, 778 F.2d 1454, 1462 (10th Cir. 1985) (emphasis added) (quoting United States v. Miller, 722 F.2d 562, 563
(9th Cir.1983)).

76 For alternative ways of drafting this rule, see Cassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 871-72 (noting that several states require
courts to inquire of prosecutors whether the victim has been advised of the proposed plea and whether the victim wishes to make a statement
concerning it).

7 This amendment to rule 12.1(a)(2)(B) was not in my previous proposal. See Cassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4 at 872-73. It is
included here for the reasons discussed infra at note 213 and accompanying text.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026559.txt,"The country's economic malaise has also led to a reportedly sharp rise in plain old, non-
Islamically sanctioned prostitution. Tehran's high-end taxi drivers, often underemployed

university graduates, casually point them out on the street.

When economies take a downturn, informal economies and illicit networks become more
attractive, says Pardis Mahdavi, author of a book on sexuality in Iran. Technology

facilitates this too.

During the shah's time, Tehran's notorious red-light district was known as Shahr-e
Noe (New City), a place where countless young Iranian men lost their virginity. Like many
things post-revolution, however, the Islamic Republic just imagined that banning the
symptom would make the problem go away. But pouring saltpeter from the minarets
hasn't worked. They razed Shahr-e Noe thinking it would end prostitution, a retired

Iranian laborer once told me. Now all of Tehran has become Shahr-e Noe.

UNSURPRISINGLY, THE OUTWARDLY CHASTE nature of Khomeinist political
culture has perverted norma] sexual behavior, creating peculiar curiosities -- and
proclivities -- among Iranian officialdom. Omid Memarian, a journalist who spent several
months in the notorious Evin prison for his articles critical of the government, told me
that his interrogators seemed far more interested in his sex life than his political
peccadilloes. I tried to answer their questions in very general terms, but they'd interrupt
me,” he recalled. They wanted to know details. 'Start from when you were unbuttoning
her blouse.... In one instance, he told me, he was horrified when an interrogator

appeared to be rubbing himself while listening.

Observers of American politics -- the land of Jimmy Swaggart, Mark Sanford,

and Newt Gingrich, to name just a few -- won't be surprised to learn that it is often the
most outspoken Iranian advocates of traditional values who fall short of achieving them.
Memarian spent part of his mandatory military service in Tehran writing speeches for a
senior Revolutionary Guard commander who routinely attacked the craven immorality of
the Global Arrogance (i.e., the United States). His filmi [the person who brought him
bootlegged films on CD] later told me that he always requested 'films with scenes’ [film-
haye sahne-dar], a euphemism for porn.

partners and consider many factors, including FDA resources and threats to public health. Beyond
this statement, the FDA has not published detailed guidance about its cannabis-related enforcement
priorities.

Bank Secrecy Act and Other Federal Laws
Regarding Financial Transactions

Financial transactions in connection with cannabis-related CSA violations may implicate federal laws
other than the CSA itself, including the federal money laundering statute, the federal unlicensed money
transmitter statute and the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).

The federal money laundering statute imposes penalties on any person who conducts or attempts
certain financial or monetary transactions involving the proceeds of a “continuing criminal enterprise”
(a term, used in the CSA, that arguably encompasses many cannabis businesses). Violations of the
federal money laundering statute may result in fines equal to twice the value of the property involved
in the transaction (or $500,000, if greater) and imprisonment for up to 20 years.

The federal unlicensed money transmitter statute makes it illegal for any person to operate or own
a money transmitter business that involves the transportation or transmission of funds known to have
been derived from or intended to promote or support criminal violations of the CSA. Violations of the
law may result in fines and imprisonment for up to 5 years.

The BSA requires banks and other financial institutions to maintain certain records and to file
certain reports deemed useful in criminal, tax or regulatory proceedings or in government intelligence
and counterterrorism activities. Federal regulations under the BSA require financial institutions to
file with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Department of
the Treasury charged with administering the BSA, a suspicious activity report (SAR) if the financial
institution knows, suspects or has reason to suspect that a transaction conducted or attempted by, at or
through the financial institution involves or is an attempt to disguise funds derived from illegal activity,
is designed to evade BSA regulations or lacks an apparent lawful purpose. Financial institutions and
their principals are subject to civil and criminal penalties for violations of the BSA.

U.S. Treasury Department: The FinCEN Memo

In coordination with the February 2014 Cole Memo update, FinCEN published a memorandum
(FinCEN Memo) outlining how banks and other financial institutions can, consistent with their BSA
obligations, provide services to marijuana-related businesses. The FinCEN Memo directs each financial
institution to consider its own business objectives and the risks associated with offering a particular
product or service when considering whether to commence or continue a customer relationship with
a marijuana-related business. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of due diligence and out-
lines a procedure for filing SARs for such businesses.

The FinCEN Memo guides financial institutions to conduct a due diligence review of a customer's
business that includes an evaluation of whether the customer relationship implicates (or would impli-
cate) any Cole Memo priority and also includes the following investigations:

specific enforcement mechanisms. °° Most important, the CVRA directly confers standing onto victims to assert their rights, a
flaw in the earlier enactment. *” The act provides that rights can be asserted by the crime victim or the crime victim's lawful
representative, and the attorney for the Government. °° The victim (or the government) may appeal any denial of a victim's
right through a writ of mandamus on an expedited basis. °° The courts are also required to ensure that the crime victim is
afforded the rights given by the new law. © These changes were intended to make victims an independent participant in the

proceedings. ©!

C. My Proposed Amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure

In the wake of the CVRA, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure needed to be significantly amended to comply with the
statute's mandates. With this goal in mind, I prepared a comprehensive set of proposed amendments to the Rules and submitted
them to the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. ©
My proposals began from the premise that victims now must be folded into the process through which federal courts conduct
criminal cases, including bail, plea, trial, and sentencing hearings. ° Because the federal rules are the playbook [*871] of
the federal courts, it seemed advisable to reflect the new role of victims throughout the Rules. Moreover, Congress intended the
CVRA to be a formula for success and a model for our States. + The only way the federal rules could serve as a model, I
argued, was by fully implementing victims’ rights. I then proposed twenty-eight specific changes to the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure to integrate crime victims into the federal process. © Each of these proposals included both specific text
for an amendment and a legal justification for the change.

D. The Criminal Rules Committee Proposals

The Advisory Committee took up my proposed rule changes in the summer of 2005. The distinguished chair of the committee,

Judge Susan Bucklew, appointed a subcommittee, chaired by Judge James Jones, to consider changes to the federal rules to
implement the CVRA. The Subcommittee, including its reporter, Professor Sara Sun Beale, prepared a report to the full
committee recommending only a few changes to the Rules. ©° The Subcommittee felt that it would not be appropriate to
create new victim rights not based upon the statute. ©” Accordingly, the Subcommittee recommended just a few changes to
the Rules, essentially parroting a few parts of the CVRA's language.

NLV-I has capital commitments of $310 million, and the Fund Managers began investing in
mid-2005. The fund completed its new investment period in early 2008 with a portfolio of 22
companies. NLV-I has fully realized 13 investments, and there are nine active investments in
companies and contingent value rights (CVRs) from three of the realized investments remaining
in the fund. NLV-I is a relatively young fund, with the majority of the cost basis still at work,
and to date has generated a gross realized IRR of 23%, and a gross total IRR of 19%. NLV-I has
a net total multiple of 1.76x and a net IRR of 12.1%. NLV-I has a distributed to paid-in-capital
ratio of 0.51x, and the Fund Managers believe the fund has significant future returns potential
from the remaining active investments in the portfolio as well as from potential payments from
CVRs on three realized investments. NLV-I is in the top quartile of funds tracked by
Cambridge Associates for U.S. healthcare venture capital in the 2005 vintage year.

NLV-II has capital commitments of $450 million, and the Fund Managers began investing in
2008. The fund will complete its new investment period by mid-2014. NLV-II currently has a
portfolio consisting of 35 companies. NLV-II has realized or partially realized 13 investments,

maintain an individual's weight within a fairly narrow range. The
signals are received in a structure at the base of the brain called the
hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is involved in the control of many
basic, subconscious drives and reflexes including sex, feeding,
ageression, drinking, and regulation of body temperature. When rats
received lesions in a particular subregion of the hypothalamus called
the ventromedial area, they became obese. They behaved as if they
were starving and compensated with an increase in food intake and a
decrease in energy expenditure. Conversely, when a different part of
the hypothalamus, called the lateral area, was destroyed, the rats
behaved as if they had been overfed. They reduced food intake and
increased energy use and thereby became dangerously lean. This is
not just a rat trick: These experiments have been replicated in a wide
variety of mammals, and humans who sustain damage to the
ventromedial hypothalamus (usually from a tumor of the adjacent
pituitary gland) will also increase their food intake and become
obese.

This model raises one obvious question: How does your
hypothalamus know how much you weigh? Let's step back and play
God for a moment. If you wanted to build this system, how would
you do it? By measuring blood glucose? Fat deposits? Core body
temperature? Pressure on the soles of the feet?

This all remained a mystery until 1994, when Jeffrey Friedman and
his colleagues at Rockefeller University reported their observations
of two strains of mutant mouse, one called obese and the other called
db. (These mutations were not created by scientists using genetic
tricks but arose spontaneously in a breeding colony.) Both strains of
mice were extremely fat, a trait that was passed on to their offspring
in a simple, dominant pattern of inheritance, like eye color. This
suggested that obesity in both obese and db mouse strains resulted
from a mutation in a single gene in each case. Friedman's group was

private practice in South Florida with personal relationships to some of the prosecutors involved.
Federal prosecutors then leaked highly sensitive information about the case to a New York
Times reporter.! The immediate result of this confluence of extraordinary circumstances is an
onslaught of civil lawsuits, all save one brought by the First Assistant’s former boutique law firm
in Miami.

The facts in this case all revolve around the classic state crime of solicitation of
prostitution.2 The State Attorney’s Office in Palm Beach County had conducted a diligent
investigation, convened a Grand Jury that returned an indictment, and made a final determination
about how to proceed. That is where, in our federal republic, this matter should rest.
Mr. Epstein faces a felony conviction in state court by virtue of his conduct, and the only reason
the State has not resolved this matter is that the federal prosecutors in Miami have continued to
insist that we, Mr. Epstein’s counsel, approach and demand from the State Attorney’s Office a
harsher charge and a more severe punishment than that Office believes are appropriate under the
circumstances. Yet despite the USAO’s refusal to allow the State to resolve this matter on the
terms the State has determined are appropriate, the USAO has not made any attempt to
coordinate its efforts with the State. In fact, the USAO mandated that any federal agreement
would be conditioned on Mr. Epstein persuading the State to seek a criminal punishment unlike
that imposed on other defendants within the jurisdiction of the State Attorney for similar
conduct.

From the inception of the USAO’s involvement in this case, which at the end of the day
is a case about solicitation of prostitution within the confines of Palm Beach County, Florida, we
have asked ourselves why the Department of Justice is involved. Regrettably, we are unable to
suggest any appropriate basis for the Department’s involvement. Mr. Epstein has no criminal
history whatsoever. Also, Mr. Epstein has never been the subject of general media interest until |
a few years ago, after it was widely perceived by the public that he was a close friend of former
President Bill Clinton.

The conduct at issue is simply not within the purview of federal jurisdiction and lies
outside the heartland of the three federal statutes that have been identified by prosecutors—18
USS.C. §§ 1591, 2422(b), and 2423(b).

1 One of the other members of Mr. Epstein’s defense team, Jay Lefkowitz, has personally reviewed the reporter’s
contemporaneous notes.

2 Although some of the women alleged to be involved were 16 and 17 years of age, several of these women
openly admitted to lying to Mr. Epstein about their age in their recent sworn statements.

their homes and even see who is ringing the doorbell, in many cases right from their smart phones.
Systems such as QuietCare, WellAWARE, FineThanx and SimplyHome are already fixtures in
some U.S. homes and seniors’ communities, although Orlov estimates fewer than 10,000 units are
in active use because the systems can be so costly.

Next month, Paul Whyte, a Markham dealer of smart-home technology that allows ordinary
electronics and appliances to communicate with each other, will unveil the GrandCare system at
the Zoomer show in Toronto.

“T call it the invisible caregiver,” says Whyte of Cybernetics Systems Inc. “The minute I saw this
system I thought, ‘There’s something that actually makes sense.’

The key, of course, with all these technologies is that the senior be relatively able-bodied and
sound of mind — most are of limited value if the senior is suffering from dementia, which is
expected to become a major public health issue in the next few decades.

But developers are also working hard on that challenging front.

Sometime later this fall or next spring the first GPS-equipped shoe, the Aetrex Ambulator, will go
on sale through www.gpsshoe.com orwww.foot.com.

Originally designed for children by Los Angeles-based GTX Corp., the new shoes are expected to
retail for about $250 U.S. They enable caregivers to track those afflicted with dementia or
Alzheimer’s thanks to GPS and cellular technology that will relay their whereabouts back to a
monitoring centre.

“Privacy may be a talking point, but it’s not really an issue,” says Patrick Bertagna, chairman and
CEO of GTX Corp.

MED Cottage creator Dupin expects concerns around privacy will fade quickly as families and
health-care systems here and in the U.S. become overwhelmed by aging baby boomers — more
than 76 million in the U.S., 10 million in Canada — who start hitting 65 next year.

“T see remote monitoring becoming an integral part of health care as we all age,” says Dupin. “One
of the issues around aging in place is going to be making trade-offs. Privacy may be something we

have to give up.”

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019540.txt,"52 | HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS

of the twenty-first century, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory and
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency developed it to
allow American intelligence operatives to cloak their movements on
the Internet. They could anonymously manipulate websites oper-
ated by Islamic radicals, for example, and create their own Trojan
horse sites to lure would-be terrorists and spies. As it turned out,
that use of Tor software had a conceptual flaw. If U.S. intelligence
services used it, the targets could figure out that anyone visiting a
site without an IP address was using Tor software to hide it. If Tor
was exclusively used by U.S. intelligence services, the targets could
further deduce that all the anonymous visitors were avatars for
American intelligence. It would be analogous to undercover police
using pink-colored cars that civilians did not use.

To remedy this flaw, the U.S. government made Tor software open
source in 2008 and freely available to everyone in the world. It even
provided funding for its promulgation, with the State Department,
the National Science Foundation, and the Broadcasting Board of
Governors financing Tor’s core developer. The public rationale for

© this generosity was that Tor could serve as a tool for, as the State ®
Department called it, “democracy advocates in authoritarian states.”
While Tor software remained a useful tool in covert operations by
the CIA, the DIA, and the FBI, it was anathema to the NSA because
it made it more difficult for it to track potential targets.

As Tor software became widely used by adversaries (as well as
common criminals), the NSA sought to find vulnerabilities in it. “It
should hardly be surprising that our intelligence agencies seek ways
to counteract targets that use Tor software to hide their communica-
tions,” explained an NSA spokesperson. The NSA’s adversaries also
took an interest in identifying Tor users because they might include
political dissidents and potential spies.

Tor software also took on a cultlike importance to hacktivists con-
cerned with the U.S. government’s tracking their activities. Catherine
A. Fitzpatrick provides an illuminating insight into the mind-set of
these hacktivists in her 2014 book, Privacy for Me and Not for Thee.
She describes them as largely “radical anarchists” who believe “the
state is all-powerful, that law-enforcement is so strong that it will
prevail anyway, and that they are a persecuted minority.” As a refuge

21. To avoid her deposition, Maxwell claimed that her mother fell deathly ill and that
consequently she was leaving the United States for London with no plans of ever returning. In
fact, however, within weeks of using that excuse to avoid testifying, Maxwell had returned to
New York.

Epstein and Maxwell’s sexual abuse.

23. | Ultimately, as a mother and one of Epstein’s many victims, Giuffre believed that
she should speak out about her sexual abuse experiences in hopes of helping others who had also
suffered from sexual trafficking and abuse.

24. On December 23, 2014, Giuffre incorporated an organization called Victims
Refuse Silence, Inc., a Florida not-for-profit corporation.

25. Giuffre intended Victims Refuse Silence to change and improve the fight against

help survivors surmount the shame, silence, and intimidation typically experienced by victims of
sexual abuse. Giuffre has now dedicated her professional life to helping victims of sex

The Food and Drug Administration has approved Praluent, a new medicine to lower cholesterol in people who 
have established heart disease, for people whose risk of a heart attack or stroke is not being adequately 
controlled by existing drugs called statins. 
It might be a big step in the battle against heart disease — and the approval is a triumph for Regeneron 
Pharmaceuticals, the Tarrytown, N.Y.-based biotechnology company that invented it. Praluent is likely to be 
more widely used, and to cost more, than Wall Steet analysts expected. That also means it could be a big cost 
down the line. 
Obviously, the class is one of the biggest developments in cardiology in the last decade, that will allow us to 
treat patients who have been extremely difficult to treat with high levels of LDL cholesterol, says Steven 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025888 
Nissen, chairman of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic. It's very promising. 
But it will also be very expensive, say Troy Brennan, the chief medical officer of CVS Caremark, the giant 
pharmacy benefits manager.If these drugs are used as broadly as they could be used, they are going to be by far 
the most expensive drug class, Brennan says. 
Praluent, an injection, lowers low-density lipoprotein, the so-called bad cholesterol, by as much as 60%, far 
more than the statin drugs alone. It is the first drug to work by targeting a protein called PCSK9. Mutations in 
the gene that makes it can result in patients having lower cholesterol and a dramatically lower lifetime risk of 
heart attacks. A rival medicine from Amgen is also expected to be approved soon. The FDA is clearing Praluent 
for patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic condition that causes high cholesterol, 
and for people who have heart disease, like those who've had heart attacks or strokes, who are already taking 
the maximum dose of a statin they can tolerate. 
Regeneron and its marketing partner Sanofi say Praluent will have a wholesale cost of $40 a day, or $14,600 a 
year, for either of two doses, 75 milligrams or 150 mgs. It's likely that insurance companies will get a 
significant discount, because Amgen and Regeneron will compete by giving the insurers rebates.

We don't want the noise about these drugs to be price, says Leonard Schleifer, the chief executive and 
founder of Regeneron. We have to make sure that people get access to the drug for a fair price if they're 
insured, for free if they're not insured, or at a discount if they're under-insured. 
Praluent's price is 46% higher than that forecast by Evercore ISI, an investment bank, and it is being approved 
for a larger group of patients than many Wall Street analysts expected following a meeting convened by the 
FDA to analyze the data on the drug. Some doctors argued its use should be restricted mainly to patients with 
FH. But Mark Schoenebaum, Evercore ISI's pharmaceutical analyst, says that investors were initially 
disappointed because they had hoped the FDA would greenlight the drug for an even broader group. Regeneron 
shares were down 2.5% in afternoon trading before they were halted pending news. 
But doctors may prescribe the drug more widely than the label suggests. A survey of physicians published this 
morning by Geoffrey Porges, an biotechnology analyst at investment bank Sanford C. Bernstein, found that they 
would use the drug in 30% to 40% of patients who had already had heart attacks. He wrote that 2020 sales of 
Praluent could be as high as $4.8 billion. 
In the survey, doctors expressed a preference for Praluent. One advantage of Regeneron's drug is that doctors 
will be able to start it at a lower, 75 milligram dose. 
Schleifer, who is a medical doctor and, incidentally, a billionaire thanks to his Regeneron stake, says that the 
company expects that as many as 8 million people who don't have their cholesterol well-controlled could be 
candidates for Praluent. He emphasized, though, that until larger studies prove the drug prevents heart attacks 
and strokes patients should always choose statins first. It will have sales representatives a 
Insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers, who help insurers and employers manage drug costs, are 
going to do their best to restrict use of Praluent, though. Brennan, the CVS Caremark executive, says that he 
expects patients will need to have medical records documenting that they have already taken statins. Those not 
taking statins would need a blood test confirming that a statin caused elevations in muscle or liver enzymes, not 
just complaints that they were achy. We're not trying to replace statins, says Schliefer, the Regeneron CEO. 
Most people who have muscle problems from statins do not have those elevated muscle enzymes, says Nissen, 
the Cleveland Clinic cardiologist, who is conducting a clinical trial Amgen and Pfizer, which is also developing 
a similar cholesterol drug. He says he has patients who are desperate to take a statin but who cannot tolerate 
it because of muscle pain but do not have elevated muscle enzymes. 
Dehspite significant progress over the last decades, high cholesterol remains a leading concern in the U.S. and 
globally, said Olivier Brandicourt, M.D., Chief Executive Officer, Sanofi. Praluent demonstrates the power of 
the Sanofi and Regeneron alliance to deliver a first-in-class therapy in the U.S. for patients in need. Sanofi has a 
strong cardiovascular heritage and dedication to these patients, and we look forward to working with other 
regulatory authorities to make Praluent available to patients worldwide. 
We are grateful to the thousands of patients and investigators worldwide who participated in the ODYSSEY 
clinical trial program, said Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer, 
Regeneron. Praluent represents the culmination of more than a decade of tireless work to translate the genetic-
based discovery of PCSK9 into an innovative medicine that brings meaningful value to patients. 
The approval of Praluent was based on data from the pivotal Phase 3 ODYSSEY program, which showed 
consistent, positive results compared to placebo, which included current standard of care therapy (statins). In the 
ODYSSEY LONG TERM trial which evaluated Praluent 150 mg every two weeks, Praluent reduced LDL 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025890 
cholesterol by 58 percent versus placebo at week 24 when added to current standard of care, including 
maximally tolerated statins. In ODYSSEY COMBO I, Praluent 75 mg every two weeks as an adjunct to statins 
reduced LDL cholesterol by an additional 46 percent compared to placebo at week 12. At week 24 in the same 
trial, Praluent reduced LDL cholesterol by 43 percent compared to placebo. In this study, if additional LDL 
cholesterol lowering was required based on pre-specified criteria at week 8, Praluent was up-titrated to 150 mg 
at week 12 for the remainder of the trial. Eighty-three percent of patients remained on their initial 75 mg dose. 
Praluent is generally well-tolerated with an acceptable safety profile. Local injection site reactions including 
redness, itching, swelling or pain/tenderness where the injection is given were the most common events (7.2 
percent with Praluent versus 5.1 percent with placebo) and resulted in a low discontinuation rate that was 
comparable to placebo (0.2 percent with Praluent versus 0.4 percent with placebo). Patients receiving Praluent 
had a greater number of injection site reactions, had more reports of associated symptoms, and had reactions of 
longer average duration than patients receiving placebo. Other common adverse events occurring more 
frequently in patients with Praluent than placebo included symptoms of the common cold and flu or flu-like 
symptoms. 
The companies carefully considered the potential medical value that Praluent offers patients in determining the 
Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC). The U.S. WAC price of Praluent is $40 per day ($1,120 every 28 days) for 
both the 75 mg and 150 mg doses, making Praluent the lowest priced patient-administered monoclonal antibody 
therapy on an annualized basis. Actual costs to patients, payers and health systems are anticipated to be lower as 
WAC pricing does not reflect discounts or rebates. Out-of-pocket costs to patients will vary depending on 
insurance status and eligibility for patient assistance. 
Sanofi and Regeneron are committed to ensuring that patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Praluent are able

ODYSSEY Program 
The ODYSSEY Phase 3 program is one of the most comprehensive clinical trial programs ever conducted for 
an investigational LDL cholesterol lowering therapy. The program includes 14 global Phase 3 trials evaluating 
more than 23,500 patients. The primary efficacy end point in all of the studies was the mean percent reduction 
from baseline in LDL cholesterol at week 24 compared to placebo (maximally tolerated statin therapy); all of 
the completed studies met their primary endpoint. A significantly higher proportion of patients achieved LDL 
cholesterol of less than 70 mg/dL in the Praluent group as compared to placebo at both week 12 and week 24. 
The ongoing ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial will prospectively evaluate the cardiovascular benefits of Praluent 
in approximately 18,000 patients.

Andrew and others this weekend.

We urgently require responses from Ms Maxwell to the following questions. Our deadline is noon tomorrow. My telephone numbers

arc To:

Annette Witheridge
On behalf of the Mail on Sunday

|. BE says Ghislaine Maxwell offered her ajob as a masseuse with Jeffrey Epstein when she was aged 15. Ms Maxwell led
P| upstairs on her first visit to him at his Palm Beach house. Mr Epstein was naked on massage table.

Ms Maxwell initiated a bisexual encounter during which Ms Maxwell rubbed her own breasts on Mr Epstein and directed to copy

her.

Please respond to these allegations and all others in the original Jane Doe 102 complaint.

2. Ms Maxwell took part in numerous other sexual encounters involving her assistant [i and Mr Epstein.

3. Ms Maxwell kept sex toys and costumes in the Palm Beach mansion and dressed prior to sex sessions with Mr Epstein. S
Maxwell herself wore black vinyl during sex sessions with Mr Epstein.

4. || was paid between US $200 and $ 5000 US sex, depending on whether it involved travel and other men.

‘Zz was required to have sex with friends of Ms Maxwell and Mr Epstein, including Glenn Dubin, Les Wexner, Ehud Barak,
former Senator George Mitchell and Stephen Kosslyn.

6. Ms Maxwell introduced to Prince Andrew in 2001 at Ms Maxwell's London house — e. sex with him. iii’

which I laugh and cry while they observe me in puzzlement. I crave reruns of television sit-
coms and revivals of shows I hated in their original incarnations.

Those must have been wonderful times to evoke such strong - and expensive - reactions.

I then described a nostalgia weekend that I and six guys I grew up spent at the Concord Hotel in
the Catskill Mountains, where we once had gone to summer camp or worked as waiters. The guys
played one-on-one basketball and horse (even those who hated hoop as kids). We told jokes so
old you could give them numbers (itself one of the oldest jokes). And we wondered about why
our lost adolescence exerted such magnetic attraction.

Those were the worst days of my life, one of the guys - who used to talk with a high
voice - confided. Suddenly, we were all contemplative. Our adolescence was miserable,
we acknowledged. As the Musak played Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing, another
related how he dreaded the slow dances because he would always become palpably
tumescent (certainly not a phrase from our youth) while doing the fox trot. Another
shocked us all by soberly confessing that he had become tumescent only once during his
adolescence, but then he reassured us by bragging that it started when I was 12 and it
didn't stop until I was 21.

I then recalled one of the most humiliating moments from my adolescence:

It was prom time, and the girls had established a committee of three to which the boys had
to apply for dates. I had my eye on a pretty blonde from an adjoining neighborhood (her
distance, I hoped, might have kept her from learning of my questionable reputation among
the local parents). As I approached the committee and shyly uttered Karen, all three
arbiters laughed. Don't you know, the cruelest admonished me, that Karen is on the A
list and you're on the C list? You can only pick from the C or D lists. It was a relief to
learn there was a list lower than mine, but a shock to be confronted with my official
ranking. I went to the prom alone and danced with my cousin, who was also on the C list.

Those were miserable years, all right. They were years of self-doubt, sexual guilt without sexual
pleasure, fears and transitions. Before you were comfortably into one stage you were already
entering another, more precarious, one. They popped up as if on schedule, like the beginning of
the yo-yo, marbles or mumble typeg seasons. So I asked myself why I insisted on recapturing the
most miserable period of my life. This was my answer:

[W]hen a man reaches the age of counting backward, maudlin nostalgia sets in and he
begins to run, not walk, to every restored toy emporium he hears about from other
retrievers of lost youth.

nearly twice a month throughout the entire Cold War would have been
overkill. In fact, Operation Sandstone -- a series of three tests at Enewetak
Atoll in 1948 -- was not intended to warn off the Soviets as tensions rose
over Berlin. Nor was the series of 48 underground tests launched in the
summer of 1964 designed to impress the newly installed premier, Leonid
Brezhnev. And the United States would not have conducted a dozen
atomic blasts at its Nevada test site in the first half of 1977 -- including the
Cove, Dofino, Marsilly, Bulkhead, Crewline, Forefoot, Carnelian, Strake,
Flotost, Gruyere, Scantling, and Scupper detonations -- just because new
President Jimmy Carter was vulnerable to right-wing criticism.

The United States did what it did because it needed its ultimate deterrent
to actually work, and because the technical requirements of the nuclear
mission continually changed. The ruins of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were
evidence enough that the United States could destroy cities, but deterring
the Soviet Union was a far greater challenge. If the Soviets had invaded
Western Europe, for example, U.S. bombers would have had to penetrate
alerted Soviet air defenses, identify Soviet ground forces and industrial
centers, and attack them. Accordingly, U.S. bombers had to be highly
maneuverable and able to carry multiple weapons, so the bombs
themselves had to be lighter and smaller than the ones the United States
used against Japan. The Soviets put another wrinkle in Washington's plans
when they began to deploy large numbers of their own nuclear weapons.
The United States needed to find a way to potentially destroy the Soviet
arsenal on the ground. Eliminating those targets -- numerous and often
hardened -- required even greater numbers of bombs, even lighter designs,
and more accurate delivery systems. So the United States updated its
designs and tested. And tested. And tested again.

Like the United States during the Cold War, North Korea has apparently
decided that nuclear weapons are central to its national security strategy.
With few friends, its conventional military forces outgunned, an economy

operational nuclear arsenal. And just as NATO planned to thwart a Soviet

warmth and safety of the mother to atop
the feet and under a fold of feathered
abdominal skin of the father requires a
bit of coordination on the part of the
two. Even this is not sufficient for the
genes of this pair to find their way into
the gene pool. The conditions of the
Antarctic winters are among the least
hospitable on earth, with winter
temperatures dipping below -60 degrees
Celsius and winds reaching 120 mph.
To protect themselves from the wind and
cold, the male penguins huddle together,
spending much of their time sleeping to
conserve energy. In this harsh
environment, survival of the chicks
depends on the shared warmth and
protection of the huddle, not the
individual. The group as a whole is
more likely to survive if each penguin
and chick shares in the warmth and
protection of the collective structure,
which means selective pressures exist to
promote cooperation to maintain the
integrity of the huddle. More generally,
for species born to a period of utter
dependency, the genes that find their
way into the gene pool are not defined
solely or even mostly by likelihood that
an organism will reproduce but by the
likelihood that the offspring of the parent
will live long enough to reproduce. As
in the case of the Emperor penguins, one
consequence is that selfish genes
evolved through individual-level
selection processes to promote social
preferences and group processes,
including reciprocal social behaviors,
that can extend beyond kin relationships
(e.g., 5). Examples of such selection
processes in humans exist, as well (e.g.,
6, 7).

The environmental challenges
facing Emperor penguins, as daunting as
they are, pale by comparison to the

complexities facing the human species.
Indeed, the social brain hypothesis posits
that the social complexities and demands
of primate species contributed to the
rapid increase in neocortical (1.e., the
outer layer of the brain) connectivity and
intelligence (8). Warfare among
ancestral hunter-gatherers appears to
have contributed to group selection for
human social behaviors, especially
altruistic behaviors (5). As Darwin
(1871) noted:

A tribe including many members
who, from possessing a high
degree of the spirit of patriotism,
fidelity, obedience, courage, and
sympathy, were always ready to
aid one another, and to sacrifice
themselves for the common good
would be victorious over most
other tribes; and this would be
natural selection. (p. 166)

Moreover, deducing better ways
to find food, avoid perils, and navigate
territories has adaptive value for large
mammals, but the complexities of these
ecological demands are no match for the
complexities of social living (especially
in hostile between-group social
environments), which include:
recognizing ingroup and outgroup
members; learning by social observation;
recognizing the shifting status of friends
and foes; anticipating and coordinating
efforts between two or more individuals;
using language to communicate, reason,
teach, and deceive others; orchestrating
relationships, ranging from pair bonds
and families to friends, bands, and
coalitions; navigating complex social
hierarchies, social norms and cultural
developments; subjugating self-interests
to the interests of the pair bond or social
group in exchange for the possibility of
long term benefits for oneself or one’s
group; recruiting support to sanction

this saga.” I told the President that I still believed that we were facing a “moment
of truth.” But only if he could “shake” Arafat, and get him to sense the enormity of
the stakes — an independent Palestinian state, versus more, and undoubtedly
deadlier, violence.

And if it did come to armed conflict? “When the people of Israel will
understand how far we were ready to go, we will have the power to stand together,
unified, in such a struggle, however tough it will become, even if we will be forced
to confront the entire world. There is no power in the world that can force on us
collective national suicide. Peace will be achieved only if there is a willingness to
negotiate on both sides. I am sure the people of Israel, and the American people,
will understand it when the details will be revealed.”

Clinton had already left for Arafat’s cabin by the time Danny Yatom went to
deliver the letter. But the President, too, was in a more sober and downbeat mood
by the time that meeting was over. Late that night when, having now read my note,
he joined me on the balcony of Dogwood. He looked exhausted. “It was the
toughest meeting I’ve ever had with Arafat,” he said. Clinton said he had told the
Palestinian leader that only one side, the Israelis, had so far been negotiating in
good faith. If Arafat was not prepared to make a genuine effort to reach an
agreement, then there was no choice but for all of us to go home. Now, it seemed,
both the President and I were left to wait and see what, if anything, Arafat came up
with in reply.

“T’ve been through battles, and danger, in my life,” I said. “But in terms of my
responsibility, today, for me as well, was probably the toughest. Shlomo and Gili
went beyond what I could live with. If this offer can’t move him, then I believe we
are left to prepare for war.” I told the President he didn’t even need to phone me
after hearing from Arafat if all he offered was some clever half-reply. Only if it
was serious and substantive. I also reminded him that while he’d promised Arafat
that he would not “blame” the Palestinians if the summit failed, that had been on
the basis of negotiating in good faith. I hoped that, if the summit collapsed in these
circumstances, he would keep to that standard.

Finally, I touched on an immediate concern if the summit broke up. For months,
the Palestinians had been talking about simply “declaring” a Palestinian state. The
Americans had insisted neither side should resort to unilateral action in a conflict
whose resolution depended on mutual agreement. The Europeans had been less

have a negative effect.

Undoubtedly, the failed peace process has bred extreme frustration
among Palestinian militants, some of whom may think that a sharp
shock is needed to wrench international attention away from the Arab
democratic wave and back to the Palestine problem. They are anxious
to alert the United States and Europe to the danger of allowing the
peace process to sink into a prolonged coma. Israeli hard-liners, too,
may calculate that a short war could serve their purpose: Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right government may sense
weakness and quietly dream of finishing off Hamas once and for all.
Syria has been a strong supporter of Hamas and has given a base in
Damascus to the head of its political bureau, Khaled Mashal. Turmoil
in Damascus could deal Hamas a severe blow.

On all these fronts -- Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel --
Syria is a key player. But its internal problems now threaten to
reshuffle the cards, adding to the general sense of insecurity and
latent violence in the region. And of all the threats facing the Middle
East, perhaps the greatest -- greater even than of another Arab-Israeli
clash -- is that of rampant sectarianism, poisoning relationships
between and within states, and breeding hate, intolerance, and
mistrust.

Several of the modern states of the Middle East -- and Syria is no
exception -- were built on a mosaic of ancient religions, sects, and
ethnic groups held uneasily and sometimes uncomfortably together
by central government. But governments have themselves been far
from neutral, favoring one community over another in cynical power
plays. Many Sunni Muslims in Syria and throughout the region feel
that Assad's Syria has unduly favored the Alawites, a sect of Shiite
Islam, who constitute some 12 percent of the population but control a
vastly greater percentage of the country's wealth. Open conflict

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013082.txt,"166 9 General Intelligence in the Everyday Human World

Under the assumption of the Embodied Communication Prior (with the Natural
Knowledge Categories assumption), the property above called “cognitive complete-
ness” is necessary and sufficient for efficient general intelligence at the level of an
inteligent adult human (e.g. at the Piagetan formal level [Pia53]).

Of course, the above considerations are very far from a rigorous mathematical proof (or
even precise formulation) of this hypothesis. But we are presenting this here as a conceptual
hypothesis, in order to qualitatively guide our practical AGI R&D and also to motivate further,
more rigorous theoretical work.

9.3.1 Generalizing the Embodied Communication Prior

One interesting direction for further research would be to broaden the scope of the inquiry, in
a manner suggested above: instead of just looking at the ECP, look at simplicity measures in
general, and attack the question of how a mind must be structured in order to display efficient
general intelligence relative to a specified simplicity measure. This problem seems unapproach-
able in general, but some special cases may be more tractable.

For instance, suppose one has

e asimplicity measure that (like the ECP) is approximately decomposable into a set of fairly
distinct components, plus their interactions

® an assumption similar to NKC, which states that the entities displaying simplicity according
to each of the distinct components, are roughly clustered together in entity-space

Then one should be able to say that, to achieve efficient general intelligence relative to
this decomposable simplicity measure, a system should have distinct capabilities corresponding
to each of the components of the simplicity measure interactions between these capabilities,
corresponding to the interaction terms in the simplicity measure.

With copious additional work, these simple observations could potentially serve as the seed for
a novel sort of theory of general intelligence — a theory of how the structure of a system depends
on the structure of the simplicity measure with which it achieves efficient general intelligence.
Cognitive Synergy Theory would then emerge as a special case of this more abstract theory.

9.4 Naive Physics

Multimodal communication is an important aspect of the environment for which human in-
telligence evolved — but not the only one. It seems likely that our human intelligence is also
closely adapted to various aspects of our physical environment — a matter that is worth carefully
attending as we design environments for our robotically or virtually embodied AGI systems to
operate in.

One interesting guide to the most cognitively relevant aspects of human environments is the
subfield of AI known as “naive physics” [Hay85] — a term that refers to the theories about the
physical world that human beings implicitly develop and utilize during their lives. For instance,

appropriate. Mr. Epstein’s counsel must also successfully expedite a plea of guilty to this charge
on a date prior to July 8, 2008, which is the date presently set by the state court Judge.

Further, the unnecessary deadline is even more problematic because Mr. Epstein’s effort
to reconcile the state charge and sentence with the terms of the Agreement requires an unusual
and unprecedented threatened application of federal law. Thus, it places Mr. Epstein in the
highly unusual position of having to demand that the State acquiesce to a more severe
punishment than it had already determined was appropriate.

We have attempted to resolve these and other issues through the USAO and CEOS,
including raising our concerns about the USAO’s inappropriate conduct with respect to this
matter. But those avenues have now been shut down. Mr. Sloman’s letter purports to prohibit
any further contact between Mr. Epstein’s defense team and U.S. Attorney Acosta, and instead
requires us to communicate with the USAO only though Mr. Sloman’s subordinates.

While it pains us to say this, this misguided prosecution from the outset gives the
appearance that it may have been politically motivated. Mr. Epstein is a highly successful, self-
made businessman and philanthropist who entered the public arena only by virtue of his close
personal association with former President Bill Clinton. There is little doubt in our minds that
the USAO never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case if Mr. Epstein were just
another “John.”

U.S. Attorney Acosta previously has stated that he is “sympathetic” to our federalism-
related concerns, but he has taken the position that his authority is limited by enforcement
policies set forth in Washington, D.C. As expressed in our prior communication to you, we
believe that a complete and independent appraisal and resolution of this case most appropriately
would be undertaken by your Office—beginning with the rescission of the arbitrary, unfair, and
unprecedented deadline that Mr. Sloman demands to have imposed in this case. At the very
least, we would appreciate a tolling of the arbitrary timeline imposed on our client by the USAO
in order to allow time for your office to consider our request that you undertake a review of this
case.

Thank you for your time and attention.
Respectfully submitted,

MD WD. Sh

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019971.txt,"through-the-eye-of-the-needle accomplishment—without unique astuteness and cunning.
Right? In the early days of the White House, this was the fundamental hypothesis of the
senior staff, shared by Walsh and everyone else: Trump must know what he was doing, his
intuition must be profound.

But then there was the other aspect of his supposedly superb insight and apprehension,
and it was hard to miss: he was often confident, but he was just as often paralyzed, less a
savant in these instances than a figure of sputtering and dangerous insecurities, whose
instinctive response was to lash out and behave as if his gut, however silent and confused,
was in fact in some clear and forceful way telling him what to do.

During the campaign, he became a kind of vaunted action figure. His staff marveled at
his willingness to keep moving, getting back on the plane and getting off the plane and
getting back on, and doing rally after rally, with a pride in doing more events than
anybody else—double Hillary’s!—and ever ridiculing his opponent’s slow pace. He
performed. “This man never takes a break from being Donald Trump,” noted Bannon,
with a complicated sort of faint praise, a few weeks after joining the campaign full time.

It was during Trump’s early intelligence briefings, held soon after he captured the
nomination, that alarm signals first went off among his new campaign staff: he seemed to
lack the ability to take in third-party information. Or maybe he lacked the interest;
whichever, he seemed almost phobic about having formal demands on his attention. He
stonewalled every written page and balked at every explanation. “He’s a guy who really
hated school,” said Bannon. “And he’s not going to start liking it now.”

However alarming, Trump’s way of operating also presented an opportunity to the
people in closest proximity to him: by understanding him, by observing the kind of habits
and reflexive responses that his business opponents had long learned to use to their
advantage, they might be able to game him, to move him. Still, while he might be moved
today, nobody underestimated the complexities of continuing to move him in the same
direction tomorrow.

OOK Ok

One of the ways to establish what Trump wanted and where he stood and what his
underlying policy intentions were—or at least the intentions that you could convince him
were his—came to involve an improbably close textual analysis of his largely off-the-cuff
speeches, random remarks, and reflexive tweets during the campaign.

Bannon doggedly went through the Trump oeuvre highlighting possible insights and
policy proscriptions. Part of Bannon’s authority in the new White House was as keeper of
the Trump promises, meticulously logged onto the white board in his office. Some of these
promises Trump enthusiastically remembered making, others he had little memory of, but
was happy to accept that he had said it. Bannon acted as disciple and promoted Trump to
guru—or inscrutable God.

Codes

Everyone has played with some sort of
secret code as a child — the Aggy Waggy
game, passing notes written in invisible
ink made from lemon juice, or perhaps
a simple cypher. If I want to send you a
secret message, I can use a substitution
code. Let’s see how good a code breaker
you are. Can you decode this?

Gdkkn Qdzcdq

It’s really easy. You might guess the
message from the pattern of letters and
your knowledge of my writing style. There are a couple of interesting
patterns to note: the 3“ and 4 letter of the first word are the same and
the first and last letter of the second word are the same. As a test I gave
this code to my wife and my eight-year-old daughter to see how long it
took them to decode... Less than a minute for my wife — a linguist. We
will come back to my daughter shortly!

Roman Emperors used this sort of simple code to secure their
messages, but modern codes have to be a great deal more sophisticated.
Let us use a progressive cipher where we vary the substitution using a
secret word. Take the name of my dog and write it down repeatedly next
to the letters of the message you want to keep secret. Now translate all
the letters in the message and the code into numbers ‘a = 1, ‘b = 2 and
so on. Then add the letters of my dog’s name to the letters of the message
one at a time. If I get to 26 (‘z’) just wrap around to ‘a and carry on. This
is called modulo arithmetic. This coding scheme will translate T to ‘a the
first time but ‘T to ‘c the second making it much harder for a linguist to
see any pattern.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013928.txt,"The Art of Undecision: Fewer Options = More Revenue

Companies go out of business when they make the wrong decisions or, just as important, make
too many decisions. The latter creates complexity.

— MIKE MAPLES, cofounder of Motive Communications (IPO to $260 million market cap),
founding executive of Tivoli (sold to IBM for $750 million), and investor in companies such as

Digg.com

J oseph Sugarman is the marketing genius behind dozens of direct-response and retail successes,

including the BluBlocker sunglasses phenomenon. Prior to his string of home runs on television (he sold
20,000 pairs of BluBlockers within 15 minutes of his first QVC appearance), his domain was print media,
where he made millions and built an empire called JS&A Group. He was once recruited to design an
advertisement for a manufacturer’s watch line. The manufacturer wanted to feature nine different
watches in the ad, and Joe recommended featuring just one. The client insisted and Joe offered to do
both and test them in the same issue of The Wall Street Journal. The result? The one-watch offer outsold

the nine-watch offer 6-to-1.22

Henry Ford once said, referring to his Model-T, the bestselling car of all time = “The customer can
have any color he wants, so long as it’s black.” He understood something that businesspeople seem to
have forgotten: Serving the customer (“customer service”) is not becoming a personal concierge and
catering to their every whim and want. Customer service is providing an excellent product at an
acceptable price and solving legitimate problems (lost packages, replacements, refunds, etc.) in the fastest
manner possible. That’s it.

The more options you offer the customer, the more indecision you create and the fewer orders you
receive—it is a disservice all around. Furthermore, the more options you offer the customer, the more
manufacturing and customer service burden you create for yourself.

The art of “undecision” refers to minimizing the number of decisions your customers can or need to
make. Here are a few methods that I and other NR have used to reduce service overhead 20-80%:

Offer one or two purchase options (“basic” and “premium,” for example) and no more.

Do not offer multiple shipping options. Offer one fast method instead and charge a premium.

3. Do not offer overnight or expedited shipping (it is possible to refer them to a reseller who does, as
is true with all of these points), as these shipping methods will produce hundreds of anxious phone
calls.

4. Eliminate phone orders completely and direct all prospects to online ordering. This seems

outrageous until you realize that success stories like Amazon.com have depended on it as a
fundamental cost-saver to survive and thrive.

5. Do not offer international shipments. Spending 10 minutes per order filling out customs forms and
then dealing with customer complaints when the product costs 20-100% more with tariffs and
duties is about as fun as headbutting a curb. It’s about as profitable, too.

Some of these policies hint at what is perhaps the biggest time-saver of all: customer filtering.

Not All Customers Are Created Equal

"
IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019965.txt,"On Monday morning, Kellyanne Conway appeared on MSNBC and offered a firm
defense of the National Security Advisor. “Yes,” she said, “General Flynn does enjoy the
full confidence of the president.” And while this seemed to many an indication that
Conway was out of the loop, it was more accurately an indication that she had been
talking directly to the president.

A White House meeting that morning failed to convince Trump to fire Flynn. He was
concerned about what it would look like to lose his National Security Advisor after just
twenty-four days. And he was adamant about not wanting to blame Flynn for talking to
the Russians, even about sanctions. In Trump’s view, condemning his adviser would
connect him to a plot where there was no plot. His fury wasn’t directed toward Flynn but
to the “incidental” wiretap that had surveilled him. Making clear his confidence in his
adviser, Trump insisted that Flynn come to Monday’s lunch with the Canadian prime
minister, Justin Trudeau.

Lunch was followed by another meeting about the furor. There were yet more details of
the phone call and a growing itemization of the money Flynn had been paid by various
Russian entities; there was also increasing focus on the theory that the leaks from the intel
community—that is, the whole Russia mess—was directed at Flynn. Finally, there was a
new rationale that Flynn should be fired not because of his Russian contacts, but because
he had lied about them to the vice president. This was a convenient invention of a chain of
command: in fact, Flynn did not report to Vice President Pence, and he was arguably a
good deal more powerful than Pence.

The new rationale appealed to Trump, and he at last agreed that Flynn had to go.

Still, the president did not waiver in his belief in Flynn. Rather, Flynn’s enemies were
his enemies. And Russia was a gun to his head. He might, however ruefully, have had to
fire Flynn, but Flynn was still his guy.

Flynn, ejected from the White House, had become the first established direct link
between Trump and Russia. And depending on what he might say to whom, he was now
potentially the most powerful person in Washington.

his right-hand player then is Ms. Maxwell, and in the

conspiracy, again, in our view we understand the defense
will take a differing point of view on this, but in our view,
the conspiracy's next echelon is Kellen and Marcinkova.

And so for example, Ms. Giuffre has made allegations
about certain things. Ms. Maxwell can't remember or denies
them, so of course Ms. Giuffre then looks to corroborate her

allegations of a conspiracy, and the first person she goes to

is Epstein, and you're familiar with that. The second and

third people that she goes to are Kellen and Marcinkova,

because they report immediately to Ms. Maxwell in the
conspiracy. And Ms. Giuffre is going to be talking about that
during the course of the trial, and immediately the jury is

going to wonder, well, gosh, I wonder what Kellen says about

that? I wonder what Marcinkova says about that? And your

Honor will recall that we went to great lengths to get them to

testify. They were evading service, in our view. We

ultimately had to come to your Honor to get alternative

service, and it was only at that point that we were able to
have them sit for their depositions. They sat for their

depositions now, and what we hear from the defense, if I

understand it, is that we don't have a good-faith basis for
asking Kellen and Marcinkova, gee, weren't you a part of this
sex trafficking and sex abuse conspiracy? I think the way they

put it in their brief is, all of this evidence shows nothing

In fact, recent testimony of several alleged “victims” contradicts claims made by federal
prosecutors during the negotiations of a deferred prosecution agreement. The consistent
representations of key Government witnesses (such as [, EE.
TE 2nd ER) confirm the following critical points: First, there was no
communication, telephonic or otherwise, that meets the requirements of § 2422(b). For instance,
Ms. Gonzalez confirmed that Mr. Epstein never emailed, text-messaged, or used any facility of
interstate commerce whatsoever, before or after her one (and only) visit to his home. [REE
Tr. (deposition) at 30. Second, the women who testified admitted that they lied to Mr. Epstein
about their age in order to gain admittance into his home. Indeed, the women who brought their
underage friends to Mr. Epstein testified that they would counsel their friends to lie about their
ages as well. MEME stated the following: “I would tell my girlfriends just like [I
approached me. Make sure you tell him you’re 18. Well, these girls that I brought, I know that
they were 18 or 19 or 20. And the girls that I didn’t know and I don’t know if they were lying or
not, I would say make sure that you tell him you’re 18.” Po Third, there was no
routine or habit of improper communication expressing an intent to transform a massage into an
illegal sexual act. In fact, there was often no sexual activity at all during the massage. I

rs testified that “[s]ometimes [Mr. Epstein] just wanted his feet massaged. Sometimes he
just wanted a back massage.” i [ also stated that Mr. Epstein.
“never touched [her] physically” and that all she did was “massage[ ] his back, his chest and his
thighs and that was it.” a Finally, there was no force, coercion, fraud,
violence, drugs, or even alcohol present in connection with Mr. Epstein’s encounters with these
women. (EE stated that “[Mr. Epstein] never tried to force me to do anything.” iii
MMM.t 12. These accounts are far from the usual testimony in sex slavery, Internet stings and sex
tourism cases previously brought. The women in actuality were not younger than 16, which is
the age of consent in most of the 50 states, and the sex activity was irregular and in large part,
consisted of solo self-pleasuring.

The recent crop of civil suits brought against Mr. Epstein confirm that the plaintiffs did
not discuss any sexually-related activities with anyone prior to arriving at Mr. Epstein’s
residence. This reinforces our contention that no telephonic or Internet persuasion, inducement,
enticement or coercion of a minor, or of any other individual, occurred. In addition, Mr. Jeffrey
Herman, the former law partner of one of the federal prosecutors involved in this matter and the
attorney for most of the civil complainants (as described in detail below), was quoted in the Palm
Beach Post as saying that “it doesn’t matter” that his clients lied about their ages and told Mr.
Epstein that they were 18 or 19.

Not only is a federal prosecution of this matter unwarranted, but the irregularity of
conduct by prosecutors and the unorthodox terms of the deferred prosecution agreement are
beyond any reasonable interpretation of the scope of a prosecutor’s responsibilities. The list of
improprieties includes, but is not limited to, the following facts:

tion graph. Given two world-paths P and Q, it’s obvious how to define the composition P*Q one
follows P and then, after that, follows Q, thus obtaining a longer path. Similarly for mind-paths.

In category theory terms, we are constructing the free category associated with the graph:
the objects of the category are the nodes, and the morphisms of the category are the paths.
And category theory is the right way to be thinking here we want to be thinking about the
relationship between the world category and the mind category.

The world-mind transfer function can be interpreted as a mapping from paths to subgraphs:
Given a world-path, it produces a set of mind state-sets, which have a number of links between
them. One can then define a world-mind path transfer function M(P) via taking the mind-graph
M(nodes(P)), and looking at the highest-weight path spanning M(nodes(P)). (Here nodes?
obviously means the set of nodes of the path P.)

A functor F between the world category and the mind category is a mapping that preserves
object identities and so that

F(P *Q) = F(P) * F(Q)

We may also introduce the notion of an approximate functor, meaning a mapping F so that
the average of

d(F(P * Q), F(P) * F(Q))

is small.

One can introduce a prior distribution into the average here. This could be the Levin universal
distribution or some variant (the Levin distribution assigns higher probability to computation-
ally simpler entities). Or it could be something more purpose specific: for example, one can give
a higher weight to paths leading toward a certain set of nodes (e.g. goal nodes). Or one can
use a distribution that weights based on a combination of simplicity and directedness toward
a certain set of nodes. The latter seems most interesting, and I will define a goal-weighted ap-
proximate functor as an approximate functor, defined with averaging relative to a distribution
that balances simplicity with directedness toward a certain set of goal nodes.

The move to approximate functors is simple conceptually, but mathematically it’s a fairly
big step, because it requires us to introduce a geometric structure on our categories. But there
are plenty of natural metrics defined on paths in graphs (weighted or not), so there’s no real
problem here.

10.4 The Mind-World Correspondence Principle

Now we finally have the formalism set up to make a non-trivial statement about the relationship
between minds and worlds. Namely, the hypothesis that:

MIND-WORLD CORRESPONDENCE PRINCIPLE
For an organism with a reasonably high level of intelligence in a certain world, relative to

a certain set of goals, the mind-world path transfer function is a goal-weighted approximate
functor.

Important Information Division

Performance / Estimated Income / Estimated Cash Flow. Past performance is not a guide of future results and may include investments no longer owned in current or closed accounts. Current
performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. To request the most current or historical performance data, or asset classification schema information, please contact your
PWM team at the number provided on your monthly statement or toll-free in the U.S. at 1-800-323-5678. Performance reports, where shown, generally present the relevant time weighted
performance, which is a combination of daily returns compounded over a specified time period with the removal of the deposit and withdrawal impacts, and may show internal rate of return
calculations where requested. Aggregate performance may not equal the sum of returns at an investment level. Performance for advisory accounts is currently calculated net of any management fees
and might include investments for which actual market prices are not currently available, and does not include private equity positions. Performance for alternative investments is calculated using the
value of the last available partnership capital statement or NAV. If included, estimated income figures and estimated private equity future cash flows are estimates of future activity, and actual results
may vary substantially. GS&Co. has adjusted performance calculations for certain asset classes or strategies and may do so in the future. Performance of net cash (i.e., cash less margin debit) is
generally included in the total performance calculation but not displayed separately. Option performance is included in the performance of the asset class of the underlier. Margin loans are generally
excluded from advisory performance but included in brokerage performance calculations. Mutual fund and ETF investment returns and the principal value of your investment will fluctuate. As a result,
your shares when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost. The performance data for ETFs does not reflect a deduction for commissions that would reduce the displayed
performance. You are not subject to a sales charge for mutual funds purchased through PWM. If a sales charge were applicable, the sales charge would reduce the mutual fund’s performance.
Information on our asset classification schema is available upon request. Generally, total returns are pre-tax and are calculated using daily time-weighted returns in which cash and securities
deposits are attributed to the beginning of the day and cash and securities withdrawals are attributed to the end of the day.

Indices / Benchmarks. Any references to indices, benchmarks, or other measure of relative market performance over a specified period of time are provided for your information only and is not
indicative of future results. In addition to the benchmark assigned to a specific investment strategy, other benchmarks (“Comparative Benchmarks”) may be displayed, including ones displayed at your
request. Managers may not review the performance of your account against the performance of Comparative Benchmarks. There is no guarantee that performance will equal or exceed any
benchmark displayed. Where a benchmark for a strategy has changed, the historical benchmark(s) are available upon request. Inception to date (“ITD”) returns and benchmark / reference portfolio
returns may reflect different periods. ITD returns for accounts or asset classes only reflect performance during periods in which your account(s) held assets and / or were invested in the asset class.
The benchmark or reference portfolio returns shown reflect the benchmark / portfolio performance from the date of inception of your account or your initial investment in the asset class. If displayed,
estimated income figures are estimates of future activity obtained from third party sources.

Indices are unmanaged. The figures for the index reflect the reinvestment of all income or dividends, as applicable, but do not reflect the deduction of any fees or expenses which would reduce
returns. Investors cannot invest directly in indices. Where appropriate, relevant index trademarks or index information has been licensed or sub-licensed for use. Inclusion of index information is not

Fees and Charges. We have two pricing models for advisory relationships: a comprehensive fee model and a product based model. You should consider factors, including, but not limited to, your
financial needs and circumstances, investment objectives, services provided under the model, your preferences, and the size of your account. Certain account fees and expenses may be more or
less expensive depending on the model chosen. Actual fees may differ from estimated fees due to differences in strategies and amounts invested in particular strategies or overall. Charges applied to
your accounts and transactions may include execution charges (including commissions, commission equivalents, mark-ups, mark-downs and dealer spreads), investment advisory fees, and custody
fees. When we act as broker, we are generally compensated by an execution charge on a trade by trade basis. When we act as advisor, we generally earn a fee based on assets under management
and may also be earning execution charges. More information about fees and charges is included in our account agreements, fee schedules and trade confirmations. If estimated fees are shown
herein, we have included a description of our fee calculation methodology.

with bulbous “female” fiberglass entities nearby. Whether anyone could actually map the
quiddities of the program (or glean its reactionary gender theater) without reading the
catalog essay is an open question. What is significant is Pask’s focus on the behaviors of
his automata, their interactivity, their responsiveness within an artificially modulated
environment, and their “reflection” of human behaviors.

The ICA’s “Cybernetic Serendipity” introduced an important paradigm: the
machinic ecosystem, in which the viewer was a biological part, tasked with figuring out
just what the triggers for interaction might be. The visitors in those London galleries
suddenly became “cybernetic organisms’”—cyborgs—since to experience the art
adequately, one needed to enter a kind of symbiotic colloquy with the servomechanisms.
This turn toward human-machine interactive environments as an aesthetic becomes
clearer when we examine a few other artworks from the period, beginning with one
constituting an early instance of emergent behavior—Senster, the interactive sculpture by
artist/engineer Edward Ihnatowicz (1970), celebrated by medical robotics engineer Alex
Zivanovic, editor of a Web site devoted to Ihnatowicz’s little-known career, as “one of
the first computer controlled interactive robotic works of art.” Here, “the computer”
makes its entry (albeit a twelve-bit, limited device). But rather than “intelligence,”
Thnatowicz sought to make an avatar of affective behavior. Key to Senster ’s uncanny
success was the programming with which Ihnatowicz constrained the fifteen-foot-long
hydraulic apparatus (its hinge design and looming appearance inspired by a lobster claw)
to convey shyness in responding to humans in its proximity. Sensfer’s sound channels
and motion sensors were set to recoil at loud noises and sudden aggressive movements.
Only those humans willing to speak softly and modulate their gestures would be
rewarded by Senster’s quiet, inquisitive approach—an experience that became real for
Thnatowicz himself when he first assembled the program and the machine turned to him
solicitously after he’d cleared his throat.

In these artistic uses of cybernetic beings, we sense a growing necessity to train
the public to experience itself as embedded in a technologized environment, modifying
itself to communicate intuitively with machines. This necessity had already become
explicit in Tsai’s “Cybernetic Sculpture” show. Those experiencing his immersive
installation were expected to experiment with machinic life: What behaviors would
trigger the servomechanisms? Likely, the human gallery attendant would have had to
explain the protocol: “Clap your hands—that gets the sculptures to respond.” As an early
critic described it:

A grove of slender stainless-steel rods rises from a plate. This base vibrates at 30
cycles per second; the rods flex rapidly, in harmonic curves. Set in a dark room,
they are lit by strobes. The pulse of the flashing lights varies—they are
connected to sound and proximity sensors. The result is that when one
approaches a Tsai or makes a noise in its vicinity, the thing responds. The rods
appear to move; there is a shimmering, a flashing, an eerie ballet of metal, whose
apparent movements range from stillness to jittering and back to a slow,
indescribably sensuous undulation.”

what makes a compelling blog, speech or opinion piece have not: clear writing and cogent argument backed up by solid
evidence and examples. Putting the pieces together, and injecting the right personal note to make for a truly memorable
piece, takes work, self-confidence and practice.

For our first New Voices Fellowship meeting in Johannesburg in June, we set up a series of training sessions on how to
handle media interviews, how to behave on camera, and how to build an online presence. But the most important part of the
curriculum turned out to be a crash course in confidence: how to believe in the importance of what you have to say. For
many of our fellows, unused to thinking of themselves as thought leaders, the leadership component was new territory.
We learned that helping the fellows define their specific areas of expertise, and to understand how that personal expertise
can translate into important contributions to the global development discussion, was an essential starting point. One fellow,
an expert on maternal health from Tanzania, found new confidence in the fact that alongside her medical degrees she has
personal experience as an African mother. Another, who specialises in poverty alleviation in Nairobi's slums, began to
harness his own stories about growing up in those slums to buttress his points about development in informal settlements.

These are exactly the types of new perspectives that will inform and enrich development policy discussions. At Aspen, we
will be recruiting our next class of New Voices fellows starting mid-September, and look forward to learning from and
working with other organisations which are committed to expanding the dialogue about what works — and what doesn't —in
global development.

Child marriage campaigners in south Asia receive $23m cash injection
Mark Tran — Guardian blog

By the age of 17, Zeenat had been divorced three times after forced marriages. She first wed shortly after puberty to aman
who abused her, an experience that recurred in her subsequent marriages.

She became so isolated that she did not go to the hospital or ask for help. Neither had she heard of India's Protection of
Women from Domestic Violence Act of 2005, which made her husband's violent outbursts not just wrong, but illegal.

Sadly, her story is all too common. Every year about 10 million girls become child brides, and one in seven girls in the
developing world marries before the age of 15.

Bangladesh, Nepal and India have three of the highest rates of child marriage, with 68.7%, 56.1% and 50% respectively of
girls married before the age of 18. Child marriage is not just a question of poverty — although that is a critical issue — but also
of how girls are viewed in society.

Even with higher levels of income, there is the practice of child marriage, said Care International's gender director,
Theresa Hwang. It is an issue of status; girls are valued in a lesser way. In India, girls are not seen as 'added value’. The
issue is squarely tied to gender equality and social norms.

Care USA, the US arm of the anti-poverty NGO, and the American Jewish World Service (AJWS) this week received grants
of $7.7m (£4.9m) and $15.3m respectively from the Kendeda fund to tackle child marriage in south Asia. Both organisations

will use the money to support local NGOs.

Founded 10 years ago, the Kendeda fund worked initially on environmental sustainability in the US, but last year created a
girls' rights portfolio. AJWS will focus on India, Care on Nepal and Bangladesh.

All three countries have laws against child marriage, but implementation has proved difficult. Civil child marriage laws are
not enforced, and religious or social customs prevail.

In Nepal, Care supports groups such as Chunauti, which seeks to spread its message against child marriage among
schools and local businesses. The local NGO persuaded factories to put anti-child marriage slogans in their production

3 MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, these reports, that are
4 loosely described as police reports, encompass a one-year
5) purported investigation by the Palm Beach Police Department
6 into the affairs of Mr. Epstein roughly beginning I think in
7 2005 and going through 2006. The detective initially assigned
8 to the case was a woman named Michelle Pagan, and then
9 Detective Recarey took over the investigation from Ms. Pagan.
1) There were a number of things, according to the reports --
ai although we don't really have any actual witness testimony,
12 with current knowledge. The police did a number of things.
13 They surveiled Epstein's house, they did trash pulls, and
14 ultimately they executed a search warrant at Mr. Epstein's
15 house. And that's sort of the totality of the investigation.
16 I give you that as the backdrop, your Honor, because
Ly then next what seems to happen is very curious, in my
18 experience, and was testified to by Detective Recarey. The
19 police get crossways with the state attorney's office in
20 Florida, and there is a complete distrust between the two

22 in-fighting that goes on between these two agencies. The

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031396.txt,"﻿A Justice Dept. discipline office
with limited reach to probe
handling of controversial child sex
abuse case
Matt Zapotosky
The Justice Department office that handles employee discipline has
opened an investigation into whether attorneys committed
“professional misconduct” in allowing a well-connected millionaire to
spend just over a year in jail to resolve allegations that he molested
dozens of young girls.
The department revealed the investigation Wednesday in a letter from
Assistant Attorney General Stephen E. Boyd to Sen. Ben Sasse (R-
Neb.), who has questioned how the department handled its inquiry of
financier Jeffrey Epstein.
Epsteinʼs case had been the subject of an investigation by the Miami
Herald, which detailed how then-U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta, now

President Trumpʼs labor secretary, shelved a 53-page indictment that
could have put Epstein behind bars for life.
Epstein, who counts among his friends Trump and former president Bill
Clinton, assembled a high-powered legal team to address the
allegations he faced. Ultimately, he pleaded guilty in 2008 only to state
charges of soliciting prostitution. Victims told the Herald they felt
betrayed by the arrangement.
The departmentʼs newly announced investigation is likely to be of
limited consequence. According to Boydʼs letter, it is being handled by
the Office of Professional Responsibility, which explores allegations of
employee wrongdoing. The officeʼs findings, at worst, typically result
in employees being fired, and they are not usually made public, though
Boyd wrote to Sasse that the office would “share the results with you
at the conclusion of its investigation as appropriate.” It is possible,
even likely, the investigation could drag on so long that Acosta, already
outside the Justice Department, would by then be out of government
entirely.
In a statement, Sasse said: “The victims of Epsteinʼs child sex
trafficking ring deserve this investigation — and so do the American
people and the members of law enforcement who work to put these
kinds of monsters behind bars. Parents should be grateful for the men
and women at the DOJ who are committed to transparency and
accountability and for the soon-to-be Attorney General who is
committed to pursuing justice.”
A representative for Acosta, who did not respond to requests for an
interview for the Heraldʼs investigation, did not immediately return a

message seeking comment for this report.
Martin G. Weinberg, an attorney for Epstein, said in a statement that
Epsteinʼs plea was “fairly negotiated by experienced teams of
attorneys representing each party.”
“It was anything but a sweetheart deal,” Weinberg said. “And it was
carefully and fully reviewed not only by senior prosecutors within the
Southern District of Florida Office but also at multiple levels of the
Department of Justice in D.C.”
The government, he said, “avoided litigation risks including the risks of
an acquittal and Mr. Epstein went to jail, served a period of probation,
lived up to each and every obligation under the Agreement, and has
fully conformed his conduct to the law for well over 10 years.”

Why Sarah Silverman Is ‘Thankful’ for Trump

<SS_tulqlf.jpeg>

On looking like an ‘asshole’ after commenting on Louis C.K.

“My experience with Louis as a teenager perhaps informs his pathology a bit. But in no way is it

analogous to crimes, to assaults, he subsequently committed that mirror it, that come from it. I was just
speaking about my own experience. And the headline was, ‘He jerked off in front of me and I didn’t
care.’ And that’s so cold and insulting and awful to the women who were hurt by his actions. So if you
clicked on it, they quoted me. But if you didn’t, and nobody does, it just makes me look like an asshole.
And me looking like an asshole is the least of it. It hurt people and there was stuff that I said that I
don’t think I was articulating the spirit of what I meant.”

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016951.txt,"Cybernetics / Art

Suzanne Treister is an artist whose work from 2009 to 2011 serves as an example of what
is happening at the intersection of our current technologies, the arts, and cybernetics.
Treister has been a pioneer in digital art since the 1990s, inventing, for example,
imaginary video games and painting screen shots from them. In her project Hexen 2.0
she looked back at the famous Macy conferences on cybernetics that between 1946 and
1953 were organized in New York by engineers and social scientists to unite the sciences
and to develop a universal theory of the workings of the mind.

In her project, she created thirty photo-text works about the conference attendees
(which included Wiener and von Foerster), she invented tarot cards, and she made a
video based on a photomontage of a “cybernetic séance.” In the “séance,” the conference
participants are seen sitting at a round table, as in spiritualist séances, while certain of
their statements on cybernetics are heard in an audio-collage—trational knowledge and
superstition combined. She also noted that some of the participating scientists worked for
the military; thus the application of cybernetics could be seen in an ambivalent way, even
back then, as a tussle between pure knowledge and its use in state control.

If one looks at Treister’s work about the Macy conference participants, one sees
that no visual artist was included. A dialogue between artists and scientists would be
fruitful in future discussions, and it is a bit astonishing that this wasn’t realized at the
time, given von Foerster’s keen interest in art. He recounted in one of our conversations
how his relation to the field dated back to his childhood:

I grew up as a child in an artistic family. We often had visits from poets,
philosophers, painters, and sculptors. Art was a part of my life. Later, I got into
physics, as I was talented in this subject. But I always remained conscious of the
importance of art for science. There wasn’t a great difference for me. For me,
both aspects of life have always been very much alike—and accessible, too. We
should see them as one. An artist also has to reflect on his work. He has to think
about his grammar and his language. A painter must know how to handle his
colors. Just think of how intensively oil colors were researched during the
Renaissance. They wanted to know how a certain pigment could be mixed with
others to get a certain tone of red or blue. Chemists and painters collaborated
very closely. I think the artificial division between science and art is wrong.

Though for von Foerster the relation between the art and science was always
clear, for our own time this connection remains to be made. There are many reasons to
multiply the links. The critical thinking of artists would be beneficial in respect to the
dangers of AI, since they draw our attention to questions they consider essential from
their perspective. With the advent of machine learning, new tools are available to artists
for their work. And as the algorithms of AI are made visible through artificial images in
new ways, artists’ critical visual knowledge and expertise will be harnessed. Many of the
key questions of AI are philosophical in nature and can be answered only from a holistic
point of view. The way they play out among adventurous artists will be worth following.

For the most part, the works of contemporary artists have been embodied ruminations on

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015938.txt,"248 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?

The story starts back in the 1940s at Berkeley University with a
young Julia Robinson, one of the first women to succeed in the previously
male-dominated profession of mathematics. By all accounts, she had a
wry sense of humor. When asked by her personnel department for a job
description she replied: “Monday—tried to prove theorem, Tuesday—
tried to prove theorem, Wednesday—tried to prove theorem, Thursday—
tried to prove theorem, Friday—theorem false.’ Like Andrew Wiles, she
fell in love with one of the great mathematical puzzles, and although she
made great strides, the problem passed from her to Martin Davis for the
next steps.

The final elements were put in place in the 1970s with the work of
another young mathematician, this time a Russian — Yuri Matiyasevich.
Robinson wrote to him when she heard of his proof, “To think all I had
to do was to wait for you to be born and grow up so I could fill in the
missing piece.” The complete result is the Robinson Davis Matiyasevich
theory which sets out the limits of logic and algebra. What, you may ask,
do we mean by logic and algebra?

Mathematicians like to turn everything into logical statements, even
ordering a round of drinks! The discipline of logic emerged from ancient
Greece as the study of language. The starting point was the syllogism:
Statements such as, “All cows eat grass.” or Lewis Carroll’s assertion,

“There are no teachable gorillas.” Over time the study of logic became
ever more precise with, for example, the introduction of variables and
equations; a=all cows, b=some grass. The formula “a eats b” translates by
substitution into, “The cows eat the grass.” This doesn’t look much like a
step forward but, trust me, it is.

The modern way to represent logic is using prenex normal form.
This mouthful simply means separating relationships between things
from the things themselves. The following four statements say the same
thing, each in a more formalized way.

Speech: Harry loves Sally
Logical: x loves y (substitute Harry for x and Sally for y)

Formal: There exists an x, there exists a y (x loves y)

Prenex: xdy (x Ry), Where R, the relationship, is ‘loves’

PRoLoGuE Snowden’s Trail: Hong Kong, 2014

3, “No Such Agency”: The best description of the birth of the NSA can be found in
Bamford, Puzzle Palace, 1-4.

4 the NSA learned: General Keith Alexander, interview with author.

4 twelve-minute video: This video can be seen at http://www.theguardian.com
/world/video/2013/jun/09/nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden-interview
-video. All of the dozens of videos Snowden made after this initial one can be
viewed in chronological order at https://nsa.gov1.info/dni/snowden.html.

© 5 Ihad written several books: My book Inquest examined the failure of the FBI, ©

the Secret Service, and the CIA to establish the context of the John F. Kennedy
assassination. This interest continued in other books of mine, including Decep-
tion, in which I investigated the vulnerability of intelligence services involved in
espionage during the Cold War, and Agency of Fear (New York: G. P. Putnam’s
Sons, 1977), in which I explored intelligence failures of domestic intelligence in
the war on drugs.

5 extradite Trent Martin: The FBI press statement on this case was released
on March 27, 2013, less than two months before Snowden bought his ticket
for Hong Kong: https://www.fbi.gov/newyork/press-releases/2013/australian
-research-analyst-extradited-on-insider-trading-charges.

6 “It’s very mysterious”: Hayden, interview with author.

6 My first surprise: I interviewed six members of the Mira staff, all of whom asked
me not to identify them. Te-Ping Chen, a journalist for the Asian edition of
The Wall Street Journal, received similar replies when she interviewed Mira
hotel employees the day Snowden left the Mira. Chen and Brown, “Snowden’s
Options for Refuge Narrow.”

6 to send Greenwald: Greenwald’s description of his encounters with Snowden
is taken mainly from chapter 1, “Contact,” and chapter 2, “Ten Days in Hong
Kong,” in Greenwald, No Place to Hide, 7-32.

7 Snowden also contacted: Gellman, “Code Name ‘Verax.’”

7 He proposed we meet: Bradsher, interview with author. Bradsher wrote a number
of excellent articles about Snowden and Ho. See Bradsher, “Hasty Exit Started
with Pizza Inside a Hong Kong Hideout.”

information, then the lawyers present arguments to your Honor
and say, 'Wait a minute. Some of the things that are in the

report aren't relevant to the case and, in fact, are going to

be highly prejudicial for the jury. That's why we're here

this morning asking for some of those things to be excluded.

For example, there are some references I won't

belabor the point -- but the references that we're making to

some of the illegal drug usage and so forth, that's not
something we're trying to deploy affirmatively. The good

doctor simply listed all of the information that had been

recited as part of his report so that the lawyers and the judge
can now make a determination.

And the fact that Ms. Giuffre told Dr. Kliman ina

confidential psychiatric examination certain things about drug
use can't possibly go to her reputation because no one was
there who was assessing what kinds of things might be going on.
A similar point can be made about tax fraud. We're
told, Well, your Honor, tax fraud goes to her reputation. I
suppose that goes to her reputation with some IRS agent who is

looking at a return, but it can't possibly go to a general

reputation that is at issue in this case.

And once again, the cases that we cite in our briefs I

think make this point clear, there is a vast risk of

prejudicial effect to Ms. Giuffre because the jury is going to

think, oh, she's a tax cheat, and they're going to hold that

"
IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020114.txt,"before a Trump-size crowd, was a political flatliner. It was a full-on Trump speech, ninety
minutes of rambling and improvisation—the wall would be built (now it was a see-
through wall), Russian interference in the U.S. election was a hoax, he would fire anybody
on his cabinet who supported Moore. But, while his base turned out en masse, still drawn
to Trump the novelty, his cheerleading for Luther Strange drew at best a muted response.
As the crowd became restless, the event threatened to become a hopeless embarrassment.

Reading his audience and desperate to find a way out, Trump suddenly threw out a line
about Colin Kaepernick taking to his knee while the national anthem played at a National
Football League game. The line got a standing ovation. The president thereupon promptly
abandoned Luther Strange for the rest of the speech. Likewise, for the next week he
continued to whip the NFL. Pay no attention to Strange’s resounding defeat five days after
the event in Huntsville. Ignore the size and scale of Trump’s rejection and the Moore-
Bannon triumph, with its hint of new disruptions to come. Now Trump had a new topic,
and a winning one: the Knee.

OOK Ok

The fundamental premise of nearly everybody who joined the Trump White House was,
This can work. We can help make this work. Now, only three-quarters of the way through
just the first year of Trump’s term, there was literally not one member of the senior staff
who could any longer be confident of that premise. Arguably—and on many days
indubitably—most members of the senior staff believed that the sole upside of being part
of the Trump White House was to help prevent worse from happening.

In early October, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s fate was sealed—if his obvious
ambivalence toward the president had not already sealed it—by the revelation that he had
called the president “a fucking moron.”

This—insulting Donald Trump’s intelligence—was both the thing you could not do and
the thing—drawing there-but-for-the-grace-of-God guffaws across the senior staff—that
everybody was guilty of. Everyone, in his or her own way, struggled to express the baldly
obvious fact that the president did not know enough, did not know what he didn’t know,
did not particularly care, and, to boot, was confident if not serene in his unquestioned
certitudes. There was now a fair amount of back-of-the-classroom giggling about who had
called Trump what. For Steve Mnuchin and Reince Priebus, he was an “idiot.” For Gary
Cohn, he was “dumb as shit.” For H. R. McMaster he was a “dope.” The list went on.

Tillerson would merely become yet another example of a subordinate who believed
that his own abilities could somehow compensate for Trump’s failings.

Aligned with Tillerson were the three generals, Mattis, McMasters, and Kelly, each
seeing themselves as representing maturity, stability, and restraint. And each, of course,
was resented by Trump for it. The suggestion that any or all of these men might be more
focused and even tempered than Trump himself was cause for sulking and tantrums on the

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020114
"

3. What experts could you interview and record to create a sellable audio CD? These people do not need
to be the best, but just better than most. Offer them a digital master copy of the interview to do with or
sell as they like (this is often enough) and/or offer them a small up-front or ongoing royalty payment.
Use Skype.com with HotRecorder (more on these and related tools in Tools and Tricks) to record these
conversations directly to your PC and send the mp3 file to an online transcription service.

4. Do you have a failure-to-success story that could be turned into a how-to product for others? Consider
problems you’ve overcome in the past, both professional and personal.

The Expert Builder: How to Become a Top Expert in 4 Weeks

L.. time to obliterate the cult of the expert. Let the PR world scorn me. First and foremost, there is a

difference between being perceived as an expert and being one. In the context of business, the former is
what sells product and the latter, relative to your “minimal customer base,” is what creates good products
and prevents returns.

It is possible to know all there is to know about a subject—medicine, for example—but if you don’t
have M.D. at the end of your name, few will listen. The M.D. is what I term a “credibility indicator.” The
so-called expert with the most credibility indicators, whether acronyms or affiliations, is often the most
successful in the marketplace, even if other candidates have more in-depth knowledge. This is a matter
of superior positioning, not deception.

How, then, do we go about acquiring credibility indicators in the least time possible? Emulating the
client-grooming techniques of some of the best PR firms in New York City and Los Angeles isn’t a bad
place to start.

It took a friend of mine just three weeks to become a “top relationship expert who, as featured in
Glamour and other national media, has counseled executives at Fortune 500 companies on how to
improve their relationships in 24 hours or less.” How did she do it?

She followed a few simple steps that created a credibility snowball effect. Here’s how you can do the
same,

1. Join two or three related trade organizations with official-sounding names. In her case, she
chose the Association for Conflict Resolution (www.acrnet.org) and The International Foundation for
Gender Education (www.ifge.org). This can be done online in five minutes with a credit card.

2. Read the three top-selling books on your topic (search historical New York Times bestseller lists
online) and summarize each on one page.

3. Give one free one-to-three-hour seminar at the closest well-known university, using posters to
advertise. Then do the same at branches of two well-known big companies (AT&T, IBM, etc.) located
in the same area. Tell the company that you have given seminars at University X or X College and are
a member of those groups from step 1. Emphasize that you are offering it to them for free to get
additional speaking experience outside of academics and will not be selling products or services.
Record the seminars from two angles for later potential use as a CD/DVD product.

4. Optional: Offer to write one or two articles for trade magazines related to your topics, citing
what you have accomplished in steps 1 and 3 for credibility. If they decline, offer to interview a
known expert and write the article—it still gets your name listed as a contributor.

5. Join ProfNet, which is a service that journalists use to find experts to quote for articles. Getting PR
is simple if you stop shouting and start listening. Use steps 1, 3, and 4 to demonstrate credibility and

the call but not the name of the caller. This anonymous data was
archived into a huge database. The idea was that when any foreigner
on the FBI’s watch list of terrorists called any number in the United
States, the FBI could trace that person’s entire chain of telephone
contacts to try to determine if he or she was connected to a known
terrorist cell. There was, however, a major flaw in this program: it
did not cover e-mail and other Internet messaging, which by 2013
had largely replaced telephone calls. In addition, terrorist organi-
zations, after the tracking down of Osama bin Laden in 2011, had
become fully aware of the vulnerability of telephoning overseas. So
although the NSA could cite a handful of early successes that “215”
yielded, Snowden’s exposure of it did only limited damage.

Snowden did vastly more damage by revealing the PRISM pro-
gram, also called “702” because it was authorized in 2008 by Section
7o2 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Its effectiveness
proceeded from the misplaced confidence that terrorist organizations
in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and Pakistan had in the encryption and
other safeguards used by giant Internet companies, such as Apple,

© Google, Twitter, and WhatsApp. They evidently had not known ©
that in 2007 the NSA found a way to intercept this data before it
was encrypted. The Internet, despite metaphors such as “the cloud”
and “cyberspace,” initially travels through fiber cables, almost all of
which run through the United States and its Five Eyes allies. So by
2013 the NSA was able to access 91 percent of the Internet before
it was encrypted. This so-called upstream data included Google
searches, tweets on Twitter, social media postings, Skype conversa-
tions, messages on Xbox Live, instant messages sent over WhatsApp,
and e-mails sent via the Internet. The NSA could also read concealed
messages in photographs and online game moves. According to a
declassified 2015 inspector general’s analysis, the actual intercep-

one of the Bannon picks; and Kelly.

In fact, Kelly—who would soon abjectly apologize to Priebus for the basic lack of
courtesy in the way his dismissal was handled—had not been consulted about his
appointment. The president’s tweet was the first he knew of it.

But indeed there was no time to waste. Now the paramount issue before the Trump
government was that somebody would have to fire Scaramucci. Since Scaramucci had
effectively gotten rid of Priebus—the person who logically should have fired him—the
new chief of staff was needed, more or less immediately, to get rid of the Mooch.

And six days later, just hours after he was sworn in, Kelly fired Scaramucci.

Chastened themselves, the junior first couple, the geniuses of the Scaramucci hire,
panicked that they would, deservedly, catch the blame for one of the most ludicrous if not
catastrophic hires in modern White House history. Now they rushed to say how firmly
they supported the decision to get rid of Scaramucci.

Fast and Simple Website Creation for Non-Techies (and Techies)

= Weebly ( www.weebly.com )

Weebly, which the BBC labeled “a must,” allowed me to create www.timothyferriss.com in less than two
hours and have it appear on the front page of Google for “timothy ferriss” searches within 48 hours. It is,
like WordPress.com below, designed to be very SEO-friendly (search-engine optimization) without any
knowledge or action on your part. No HTML or Internet expertise is required.

» WordPress.com ( www.wordpress.com )

I used WordPress.com to set up www.litliberation.org from a coffee shop in Bratislava, Slovakia, when a
U.S.-based designer flaked out and left me scrambling. It took me less than three hours to learn how to
use it and build the site. The site, an experimental educational fundraiser, ended up raising 200%+ more
than Stephen Colbert in the same period of time. I also use their free open-sourced version of WordPress
(www.wordpress.org, which requires separate hosting) to manage everything for my top-1,000 blog at
www.fourhourblog.com. This offers greater customization but requires more management and technical
know-how.

Both Weebly and WordPress.com host your site for you, so additional hosting setup isn’t required.

If you choose to use www.wordpress.org (not.com) for greater customizability, I suggest using a
hosting service with one-click WordPress installation like www.bluehost.com. The Shopp plug-in
(http://shopplugin.net/) or Market Theme plug-in (http://www.markettheme.com/) can then be used to
add e-commerce capabilities. Shopify.com (discussed later) is another good all-in-one alternative.

nature, the braggart businessman, with his bankruptcies, casinos, and beauty pageants, had
avoided serious vetting. For Trump students—which, over his thirty years of courting
attention, many in the media had become—the New York real estate deals were dirty, the
Atlantic City ventures were dirty, the Trump airline was dirty, Mar-a-Lago, the golf
courses, and the hotels all dirty. No reasonable candidate could have survived a recounting
of even one of these deals. But somehow a genial amount of corruption had been figured
into the Trump candidacy—that, after all, was the platform he was running on. /’// do for
you what a tough businessman does for himself.

To really see his corruption, you had to see it on a bigger stage. Foer was suggesting a
fabulous one.

Assembling a detailed road map for a scandal that did not yet exist, Foer, without
anything resembling smoking guns or even real evidence, pulled together in July virtually
all of the circumstantial and thematic threads and many of the various characters that
would play out over the next eighteen months. (Unbeknownst to the public or even most
media or political insiders, Fusion GPS had by this point hired the former British spy
Christopher Steele to investigate a connection between Trump and the Russian
government.)

Putin was seeking a resurgence of Russian power and, as well, to block encroachments
by the European Union and NATO. Trump’s refusal to treat Putin as a semi-outlaw—not
to mention what often seemed like a man crush on him—meant, ipso facto, that Trump
was sanguine about a return of Russian power and might actually be promoting it.

Why? What could possibly be in it for an American politician to publicly embrace—
sycophantically embrace—Vladimir Putin and to encourage what the West saw as Russian
adventurism?

Theory 1: Trump was drawn to authoritarian strongmen. Foer recounted Trump’s
longtime fascination with Russia, including being duped by a Gorbachev look-alike who
visited Trump Tower in the 1980s, and his many fulsome and unnecessary “odes to Putin.”
This suggested a lie-down-with-dogs-wake-up-with-fleas vulnerability: consorting with or
looking favorably upon politicians whose power lies partly in their tolerance of corruption
brings you closer to corruption. Likewise, Putin was drawn to populist strongmen in his
own image: hence, Foer asked, “Why wou/dnt the Russians offer him the same furtive
assistance they’ ve lavished on Le Pen, Berlusconi, and the rest?”

Theory 2: Trump was part of a less-than-blue-chip (much less) international business
set, feeding off the rivers of dubious wealth that had been unleashed by all the efforts to
move cash, much of it from Russia and China, out of political harm’s way. Such money, or
rumors of such money, became an explanation—still only a circumstantial one—in trying
to assess all the Trump business dealings that largely remained hidden from view. (There

Trump might be stuck in a 1980s time warp on Japan. When his “The Art of the Deal” was published in 1987, Americans
were envious of Japan’s brilliant leaders, who were said to be outsmarting the United States at every turn. Since then,
Japan has become the poster child for economic stagnation and political paralysis. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been
unwilling or unable to get his promised reforms enacted, and the country’s economy continues to shrink.

Mexico is watching its growth collapse. While its president, Enrique Pefia Nieto, is a courageous and intelligent leader
who has made some very bold decisions, he has also made some significant missteps. Most important, the country was
ill-prepared for plunging oil prices that have battered government revenues and growth.

China has had three decades of supercharged growth and competent government policy. But in the past few years,
Beijing went on a borrowing binge, running up its total debt to levels that are unprecedented, according to Sharma. And
in the past two months it has made mistakes in managing both its equity markets and currency — mistakes that have
cost $400 billion, the Financial Times reports.

Of course, the United States has problems that are worrying, such as wage stagnation and low labor-force participation.
But the important comparison is not to some ideal fantasy of what America might be but to other countries in the real
world. And the facts show, Mr. Trump, we’re killing them .

Police reports entered into the record go into stomach-wrenching detail about Epstein’s alleged exploits with the girls and women he
recruited and paid for massages that became sexual acts, and mention other women participating as well. Epstein’s longtime friend,
the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, is accused of taking part, while his personal assistant, Sarah Kellen, is described procuring young

woman for him.

But neither of those women has ever said a word about Clinton being involved. Maxwell, for her part, has never been deposed. She

For her part, Kellen, who won immunity from prosecution along with Epstein in 2007, did sit for a deposition, but repeatedly pleaded

the Fifth, refusing to even say if she’d ever even met the former president.
Epstein’s much-discussed flight logs show fairly conclusively that she has.

A review of the handwritten documents shows Clinton taking 13 trips in Epstein’s specially outfitted Boeing 727, including a much-
discussed trip to Africa with Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker. In every single instance, the logs show, Kellen was also on the plane, as
was Epstein. That may sound suspicious, except for the fact that Kellen has been described as Epstein’s right hand, profoundly involved
in his professional activities as well as personal ones. Indeed, Doug Band, Clinton’s personal aide, was on all but one of the flights the

former president took on Epstein’s jet.

"

demands that these allegedly unwitting juveniles (though they have come here for
this very purpose) perform repulsive (or at least repulsively described) acts on him
and then they return again. (Although the nature of the allegations will
dramatically grow into threesomes and forced sexual encounters, nobody at this
point alleges anything more than Epstein masturbating. )

Epstein vastly raises the stakes by calling Dershowitz, who flies into Palm
Beach to put the local authorities in their place—alienating Palm Beach
officialdom—and, doubling down on the profile of the case, brings in Roy Black
the famous criminal attorney who defended William Kennedy Smith in his rape
trial in Palm Beach.

Here’s the narrative: the shadowy rich man, friend of the louche and
disgraced President, at all times surrounded by a retinue of young and gorgeous
female retainers doing his bidding, is now found to have gathered a network of
wrong-side-of-the-tracks Palm Beach girls to provide him with weird sexual
services. (It somehow reads weirder that he doesn’t have sex with them.) To boot,
his former girl friend, Ghislaine Maxwell—the daughter of the disgraced Robert
Maxwell—encouraged at least one of the girls to come to Epstein’s home (and
forever more has become a fixture of further weird possibilities in this tale).

Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter is reported to say: “This is bigger
than Rush Limbaugh,” who, in a storm of publicity, has just been arrested in Palm
Beach for possession of controlled drugs.

On one side are some of the nation’s most powerful defense attorneys (who,
increasingly, seem more stumblebum than effective), on the other side, a round-up
of hapless girls, with sensational tales of perversion and infamy (in the telling they
are not so much sex workers, as Dickensian victims), relatively speaking giving the
Palm Beach authorities the choice between utter capitulation to the powerful or
standing on the side of the seemingly exploited and powerless.

Still, with a cold eye, it also quite appears to be a straightforward tale of
prostitution (however more or less kinky). And even though some of the girls are
minors, age is not a distinguishing factor in a solicitation charge in Florida, (in
New York, for instance, at this time soliciting sex with anyone over the age of 14
is a class D misdemeanor calling for a $100 fine—the law has recently been
changed to TK).

In fact, the very “SG” clearly tells the police that she lied about being 18
because otherwise she knew she would not have been admitted to the house (other
girls will say they knew this is what they had to say, nevertheless not stopping
them from saying it).

The local sex crimes prosecutor, Lana Belhalevic, interviews all the girls and
determines that the offense is solely related to prostitution—that there are “no real

Leona Helmsley

Leona Helmsley was not a good client. She too was boring and rather stupid. She was called the
queen of mean, and I can only disclose incidents that occurred in public. Here’s one that shows
how she earned her title. We were having breakfast in the dining room of her hotel, when a
waiter brought me a cup of tea. She noticed, but I didn’t, that a little bit of the tea had dripped
onto the saucer. It was certainly no big deal. When she saw it she grabbed the tea and the saucer
and threw it on the floor in the direction of the waiter, shattering it into many pieces. She then
screamed at the waiter, “Now clean it up and beg me for your job.” I simply walked away, not
wanting to be associated with that kind of public rudeness.

When my daughter was born, Leona had her private jet fly a large stuffed bear to Boston, where it
was placed in a limo and brought to our home. My daughter loved the bear and several years
later had an opportunity to thank Leona for sending it. Leona replied: “It’s stolen merchandise. I
stole it from Donald Trump.” She then explained how she had sold a hotel to Trump that
included a pastry restaurant called Rumplemyers, which was decorated with large stuffed animals.
The sale included the stuffed animals, but Leona took the bear, which belonged to Trump, and
sent it to my daughter. I told Leona that I would either have to return the stolen bear or get
Trump’s permission to keep it. She said, “tell the Donald I stole it from him. See what he says.”
I told Trump. He laughed and said “I’m not surprised. Let your daughter enjoy the bear.”

One day my brother, who was another of her lawyers, was invited to a birthday party at her
house. He brought my mother along. Leona knew that my mother did not want to be confronted
with the reality that my brother is not kosher outside of his house. My brother, sensitive to this,
always eats only kosher food in her presence. He was on line with my mother at the buffet
choosing among the smoked salmon and vegetables when Leona came over to my mother and
brother and in her booming voice yelled, “In front of your mother you eat salmon. In front of me
you eat lobster. Ha ha ha.” It was entirely gratuitous, hurtful and all too typical.

Although my brother and I—who were her appellate lawyers—saved Helmsley several years
imprisonment by winning the state appeal—Helmsley refused to pay our final legal bill. We
should have demanded up front payment for all our services because she had a reputation for
“negotiating” all of her bills. (“I'll give you 25 cents on the dollar. If you don’t like it, sue me!”’)
My brother eventually sued her but dropped the suit after she said she would spend “a large
fortune beating him into the ground.”

Once when we were waiting to go to court, Leona told me a joke about two competitive Russian
neighbors who hated each other. One day, the first one tripped over a lamp and a genie popped
out. “You get the usual three wishes, but here’s the catch: everything you ask for and receive,
your neighbor gets double.” He asked for a thousand rubies, and the next day the neighbor
boasted, “I got 2,000 rubies.” He asked for a beautiful woman, and the neighbor bragged he got
two women. Finally, in frustrations he asked the genie, “Would it be too painful to cut off one of
my testicles?”

arresting each others' children. Iran's nuclear programme appears to
proceed independent even of the organs of its own state.

A spoof article in the Economist last year portrayed Iran's supreme leader,
Ayatollah Khamenei, ruminating on western nations' obsessive posturing
towards his country. He mused that these were unstable, unreliable places,
dangerous though probably not all mad. But since it was hard to be sure, I
would feel a lot safer 1f we already had that bomb. Similar insecurity
drove sanctioned Cuba to accept Russian missiles in the 1960s, and
sanctioned Iraq and Libya to pretend to build weapons of mass destruction
in the 1990s.

Sanctions never stop bad things happening. Rather they entrench dictators,
build up siege economies and debilitate the urban middle class from which
opposition to dictatorship grows. As Khamenei said in a speech a year
ago, sanctions were painful ... but make us more self-reliant. Indeed, for
a regime to be sanctioned 1s to receive an elixir: witness Castro, Gaddafi,
the ayatollahs and the ruling cliques of Burma, Afghanistan and North
Korea. That sanctioned regimes sometimes come to an end is not proof
that sanctions work, rather that they take a long time and usually require
war to work.

This is a rarely researched topic because sanctions are diplomatic ideology
rather than science. A debate in 1998 in International Security magazine
saw the Chicago academic, Robert Pape, barely challenged in his view
that only around five of the 115 cases of sanctions imposed since the war
could claim any plausible efficacy. Most merely inflicted significant
human costs on the populations of target states, including on innocent
civilians who have little influence on their government's behaviour. They
are a ready invitation to war.

When I was reporting on South Africa in the 1980s I became convinced
that sanctions were aiding import substitution and benefiting the Afrikaner
economy, probably giving apartheid an extra decade of life. They likewise
prolonged Ian Smith's regime in Rhodesia. Sanctions made Libya's
Gaddafi so rich he could spoon money into the London School of

Fig. 6.9: Example of Implicit Knowledge in the Atomspace. A simple example of implicit
knowledge in the Atomspace. The chicken and food concepts are represented by maps
of ConceptNodes interconnected by HebbianLinks, where the latter tend to form between Con-
ceptNodes that are often simultaneously important. The bundle of links between nodes in the
chicken map and nodes in the food map, represents an “implicit, emergent link between the
two concept maps. This diagram also illustrates glocal knowledge representation, in that the
chicken and food concepts are each represented by individual nodes, but also by distributed
maps. The chicken ConceptNode, when important, will tend to make the rest of the map
important — and vice versa. Part of the overall chicken concept possessed by the system is ex-
pressed by the explicit links coming out of the chicken ConceptNode, and part is represented
only by the distributed chicken map as a whole.

There was a freshman co-ed at Berkeley who—long after she had forgotten what some
professor spouted during an official lecture about Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment—would

12, headquartered in McLean, Virginia, is a curriculum company and management company for
kindergarten through ninth grade (grades 10-12 currently in development). «712 is the largest operator of
K-12 virtual schools in the world, &12’s mission is to enable delivery of world-class education for students
in grades K-12, consisting of comprehensive online and offline curriculum that supports numerous
applications. 12 has invested more than $70 million in building a state-of-the-art curriculum offering,
integrated assessment and the supporting technology delivery systems.

13.1. History

k12 was founded in December 1999, with the goal of leveraging technology to create the highest-quality
curriculum. 12 launched its first offering in September 2001 for students in grades K-2. This offering
was launched in conjunction with several of the world’s leading education experts and included interactive
lessons in Language Arts, Math, Science, History, Art and Music. &12 launched grades 3-5 in the fall of
2002, grades 6 and 7 in the fall of 2003, grade 8 in the fall of 2004 and grade 9 in fall of 2005. k12 has
continually improved its production process and is now producing courses that are of higher quality and at
a lower cost per lesson than it originally produced. Building the service in this modular, roiling fashion
allows k12 to capture students at an early stage and to build out its product offerings in alignment with
student progress.

13.2. Current Operations

k12 provides a world-class education for its students which combines a comprehensive online and offline
curriculum with integrated assessments and supporting technology delivery systems. «12 currently
provides its education to grades K-9 through more than 7,000 interactive lessons, and is in the process of
developing content for grades 10-12. Today, k12 sells its curriculum through the following channels:

& Virtual public schools (91% of 2006E Revenue)

— k12 ts the largest curriculum and management provider to virtual public schools in the U.S.

— k12 offers its curriculum directly to the rapidly growing virtual school market (projected to be offered
to 24,000 students in 2007)

® District: managed virtual programs (3% of 2006E Revenue)

— k12 sells the curriculum and technology directly to school districts who mange their own virtual
schools

— This is a fairly new initiative for 12 but is expected to be a larger part of total revenue over time

H School districts for traditional classrooms (3% of 2006E Revenue)

— k12's science curriculum has been piloted as the science curriculum in various school districts
including Philadelphia

— Initial results are promising

B Direct to consumer (3% of Z006E Revenue)

~—- To parents who prefer home-schooling or want to augment or enhance their children’s public or
private school education

the basic problem is simple—i am going against a strong national trend—well-known man after well-known man is being brought low for alleged
his misbehaviour toward women—in some case well-deserved prison time (Cosby and perhaps Weinstein) in many other cases, simply being run
out of institutions—exactly my fate

furthermore in he say/she say confrontations the evidence has shifted—in University settings at least—from 'beyond a reasonable doubt' to a

the loss is huge, on the order of a half million to a million dollars, meant to keep me alive (they were going to offer a five-year contract) while i let
my ‘inheritance’ be spent on children and grandchildren while also growing

i have no choice but to work

i will get my revised Wild Life to an agent later this week—have added 5 new chapters and a few sections—much stronger for the inclusion of my

Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation into
Russia's role in the 2016 presidential election.A </p>

<p>According to US media, Rosenstein was meeting with White House Chief of Staff John
Kelly after reports surfaced that he had offered to resign in speculation of being
fired.A </p>

<p>Axios, citing an unidentified source with knowledge of the matter, reported that
Rosenstein verbally resigned to White House Chief of Staff John Kelly. A second source
told the news outlet that Rosenstein is expecting to be fired so he plans to step
down.A </p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal, citing an individual familiar with the matter, reported
that Rosenstein has not submitted his resignation.</p>

<p>NBC News reported that Rosenstein said he would not resign and the White House would
have to fire him.</p>

<p>Reuters news agency, also citing a person familiar with the matter, said Rosenstein
had not resigned and is still serving as US deputy attorney general. The news agency
reported that the unnamed source confirmed that the deputy attorney general hada
previously scheduled meeting at the White House on Monday and that the Axios reports
were false.A </p>

<p>The reports come as Trump faces mounting pressure from the investigation by Special
Counsel Robert Mueller, who is looking into Russia's role in the 2016 presidential

<p>There was widespread speculation that Trump would fire Rosenstein after a New York
Times report on Friday said in 2017 he had suggested secretly recording Trump and

X, fair enough, cross examine her about it, inconsistent

statement. We're not objecting to that aspect of that.

What we don't want is the lawsuit itself and the

circumstances surrounding the lawsuit to be paraded in front of

jury. If they simply want to put in a deposition statement to
stay it's inconsistent, and that's properly done, of course,
that would be appropriate.

Their second point is, she participated for a period

of time. I guess she participated if you're subpoenaed as a

witness and testified, but that wasn't -- you know, she wasn't
a party to the case.

Their third point was that the reputational damages

somehow link into what Dershowitz was saying. Again, your
Honor already knows our point one is to keep out Mr. Dershowitz
from the case, and you'll make a ruling one way or the other on

it. If he's kept out of the case then this becomes a moot

point. But even if you decide he's in the case, well, okay,
fine. Have him testify and do whatever else you think is
appropriate. We don't need to hear all about this unrelated
lawsuit.

Their fourth point had to do with, I believe, you

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014048.txt,"2014] CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS 69

Epstein spent much of the jail term on “work release” to his luxurious
office.*

The U.S. Attorney’s Office did not tell Epstein’s victims about the
nonprosecution agreement until well after it had taken effect. To the
contrary, even after the nonprosecution agreement had been signed, the
Office continued to tell the victims that the case was still “under
investigation” and that they should be “patien[t].”*° When the victims
learned of the agreement, two of them (Jane Doe Number One and Jane
Doe Number Two) filed suit in federal court under the Crime Victims’
Rights Act, arguing that the prosecutors had violated their CVRA right to
confer as well as their right to be treated fairly.*’ The victims contended
that prosecutors should have conferred with them about the nonprosecution
agreement before it became final.

In response, the U.S. Attorney’s Office argued primarily that it was
under no obligation to extend the victims any rights under the CVRA. It
was the Government’s blunt position that “CVRA rights do not attach in the
absence of federal criminal charges filed by a federal prosecutor.”*8 In
short, the Government argued it was not required to confer in any way with
the victims, or even treat them fairly, because the CVRA was not yet in
play. The issue is thus squarely framed: Is the Government correct in its
assertion that it has no CVRA obligations in cases like the Epstein case
where federal prosecutors never lodged federal charges against a suspect?
In view of the CVRA’s prominence, resolution of this issue may shed
important light on the nature of crime victims’ enactments and the breadth
of the role that crime victims should have in the criminal justice process.

II. THE CVRA’S APPLICATION BEFORE FORMAL CHARGES ARE FILED

To analyze the issue of whether the CVRA extends nghts to crime
victims before prosecutors have formally filed charges, it is useful to look at
the CVRA’s purposes, language, and judicial interpretations. This Part
looks at each of these three issues in turn.

largest up or down amplitude as possible, its fractal dimension would approach (but

not reach) that of the embedding plane, Euclidean d = 2.

The Do of the one dimensional Richardson technique (Mandelbrot, 1967) can
be computed by covering the one dimensional surface of a time series with a
number, #, of line segments of several orders of magnitude range of lengths, /
-Graphing log(l) along the x-axis and log #(I) along the y-axis yields a negative linear
slope, -s. As defined, 1- s = Do noting that (-(-s)+s) such that 1 < Do = 1+s < 2.
Strain differences and peptide and psychotropic drug-induced changes in Do
computed in this way were found in time series of fluctuations in rat brainstem
tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylase activities under far-from-equilibrium co-
reactant concentrations (Mandell and Russo, 1981; Knapp et al, 1981; Knapp and
Mandell, 1983; 1984). Systematic influences of stimulant drug dose on Do were
found as well in these systems (Mandell et al, 1982). This simple measure, made
directly on the “roughness” of the graph of a one dimensional time series rather than
on its orbital reconstruction, has been used to discriminate the pattern of
fluctuations in daily mood scales in normal subjects and mood disordered patients
(Woyshville et al, 1999). These findings confirmed dimensional scaling exponents
on higher dimensional embeddings of similar time series in mood disordered
patients (Gottschalk et al, 1995; Pezard et al, 1996). Due to the ease and rapidity of
its computation, techniques involving Do on one dimensional time series are
currently in development as possible real time epilepsy predictors when analyzing

the output of a large number of EEG leads simultaneously.

If M(e) is the minimum number of d-dimensional cubes of side ¢ required to
cover the d-dimensionally embedded attractor, plotting a logarithmic range of rulers
of length ¢ (as e—0) along the x axis and a logarithmic range of number of cubes,
M(e), each of corresponding «-edge size, along the y axis, results in a negative
(more smaller M(e) ‘s and fewer bigger M(e) ‘s) power law slope Do. Here the
numbered covering cubes, M(e), are those in which the probability of containing at

least one point (its “probability density measure,” often called uw) is not zero. We

tremendous devotion to her clients and her admirable motivation to insure that victims of sexual
abuse receive effective legal representation when attacks on their credibility are made.

Conclusion
55. In light of all these facts, I believe that Mr. Dershowitz’s bar complaint against Mr.
Boies and Ms. McCawley is frivolous. The foregoing statements are my personal statements and
are not an institutional position of the University of Utah. I request that this information be
treated confidentially by the Florida Bar and not disseminated outside of the Bar (and those

I declare that the foregoing statements are all true the best of my information and belief,

empirical scaling exponents describing real observables as limited by the precision
of the observations, their resolution and series lengths (Smith, 1988; Eckmann and
Ruelle, 1992). The “correlation integral,” the probability that two vectors chosen at
random from the phase space reconstruction lie within “r” distance of each other,
not unrelated to the phase randomization controlled, Dz measure, yields statements
about amount of “nonlinearity” (not accountable by the linear regressively
capturable component of the power spectrum), which are also difficult to translate
into experimentally or theoretically useful concepts (Casdagli et al, 1997). These
efforts contrast with a more direct attempt to establish a spiking neuron system’s
dynamical “dimension” using trial and error prediction in which “dimension” was
defined as the number of potentially physiologically relevant variables required to

make the predictive equations fit (Segundo et al, 1998).

Computations of scaling exponent descriptors of orbital point distributions on
reconstructed attractors of the brain sciences have proven to be most useful as
atheoretical, empirical techniques discriminating experimental, clinical and/or
treatment conditions with various approaches to statistical significance. In this
regard, one can say that D2 is often found to be superior to central tendency
oriented statistics in making these discriminations. Dimension and _ correlation
integral descriptors appear least useful when dealing with global issues such as
chaos, randomness, linearity and the “underlying dimensions” of (unknown)
differential equations. We discuss below the possibility that the failure to find chaos
in the more recent EEG studies (Theiler and Rapp, 1996; Prichard et al, 1996) may

be because the EEG attractor is better characterized as a “strange nonchaotic
atttractor” with orbital patterns manifesting fractional scaling exponents but no 2(+)
(Grebogi et al, 1984; Mandell and Selz, 1993).

The relatively subtle influence of high altitude (Mt. Everest) oxygen
concentrations was not seen in the central moments of the cardiac interbeat

intervals, but the D2 of the attactor was reduced significantly (Yamamoto et al,

1993). The latencies and amplitudes of the visual evoked potential failed to

his rally, played it like a virtuoso. “Did you hear what they called you?” he
cried. Chachachim. He slightly mispronounced the word, as if he’d never heard,
much less used, it before, and that even having to repeat it made his blood
curdle. “Is that what you are?” There was pandemonium. Maybe Begin would
have won anyway. But it was close, just one Knesset seat between the two
major parties. And win, he did.

I became increasingly convinced in the weeks that followed that Begin’s
second government, with Arik now moved to defense minister, would further
put the brakes on any follow-up negotiations for a deal with the Palestinians. I
did not yet know that Arik, in particular, had a far more ambitious, military plan
to try to bury the possibility of a Palestinian state once and for all. But I did
know he had his eyes on a possible thrust across our northern border into
Lebanon, where Arafat and the PLO were based.

There was no public mention of any of this. But several times in 1981, I was
ordered to move a large part of my division onto the Golan Heights for weeks at
a time: two brigades, 200 tanks and dozens of APCs in a massive motorcade
from the bottom to the top of the country and back again. We dubbed it
Cinerama, from the Hebrew words for Sinai and the Heights, Ramah. If there
was an escalation of hostilities, the northern command’s regular division would
cross into Lebanon. Our role would be to take their place in defending the
Golan, and possibly follow them in.

When I returned from my final episode of Cinerama in the late summer of
1981, the Sinai withdrawal was entering its final stage. I organized a full-scale
military exercise on the roughly one-third of the Egyptian desert we still held,
knowing that we’d no longer have the room to do so after the final withdrawal.
It was the largest exercise I'd ever commanded. The advances and tactical
retreats, the flanking maneuvers and ambushes and fighter jet attacks were like
a very big war in a very small place.

But a war game was not a real war. The Sinai was not like the Golan, or the
cramped, hilly confines of Lebanon. And it was in Lebanon, the following year,
that the war came. It was different from any in Israel’s history. Arik was in
charge. And I would become involved in ways which began to change the way I
saw not only Arik, but the political and military direction of our country.

people. This is the answer of most social psychologists.

They take the famous Asch conformity experiments, in which participants believe a group over the evidence of
their own eyes; and Milgram obedience experiments, in which participants agree to electrocute one another at
the experimenter’s request to show that people are sheep.

Psychologist Daniel Gilbert, a strong proponent of the view that humans are gullible, has even claimed that
people couldn’t help but believe (at first at least) everything they read! Tim Levine, a leading researcher
working on lie detection, thinks that people rely on others to be trustworthy most of the time, and that as a result
they can afford to be so bad at detecting deception. Paul Ekman, the famous emotion researcher, claims that
when we see someone express an emotion, we can’t help but mimic it. No surprise then that crowds and

their emotional members drive each other mad! Robert Boyd, Peter Richerson, and Joseph Henrich, proponents
of the dominant mode of cultural evolution, postulate that people are easily influenced by prestigious individuals
—wherever their prestige comes from—and consensual opinions — whatever their value.

This is also the answer of dominant figures in anthropology and sociology, explaining the persistence of culture
by our tendency to suck in whatever ideas surround us without a second thought; in political science since the
ancient Greeks, explaining the success of demagogues by how easily people follow charismatic leaders, even
toxic ones; and in much social commentary, consider Manufacturing Consent by Edward Herman and Noam
Chomsky as an example.

GENETIC RESCUE

Saving Wildlife the Way Evolution Does
By Ryan Phelan, Introduction & Epilogue by Stewart Brand
[Proposal; Delivery: 12-18 months from signed contract; 70,000 — 80,000 words]

Genetic Rescue is the first book to present a critically important and new scientific field emerging through the
synthesis of molecular biology and conservation biology. At the heart of this intersection is the development of a
new tool kit for 21st Century conservation. Advances in comparative genomics, cloning, germ cell transmission,
ancient genome assembly, de-extinction, synthetic DNA, and genome engineering with CRISPR and gene drives
are now being applied to help solve seemingly intractable conservation problems.

Genetic Rescue makes the compelling case for human intervention in situations where the natural evolutionary
process is compromised. It is replete with specific examples of wildlife on the brink (from the black-footed
ferret to the northern white rhino) and the impact of wildlife diseases (amphibians with Chytrid disease and bats

with white-nose syndrome).

Genetic Rescue also presents a provocative new vision for conservation—the development of a 21st Century

and volunteers for Dawkins’ foundation.

° Afterwards, the student invited you to join the volunteers for a drink.

° You asked her to come get you in your hotel room. She was wary of your intentions, and so brought a
male friend with her. Opening the door to find them both there, you informed her you had decided not to go.
° You met this student again at the American Atheists Convention in Des Moines, lowa, in April 2011.

° You pulled over a chair for her in the bar, and then started running your hand up her leg under the
table.

° She tried to shift her body away from you, and you persisted in putting your hand on her leg. She

crossed her legs, and you kept trying. Then she turned her entire body away.

Incident 5:

° This incident allegedly occurred on in May 2011 on a CFI cruise. We understand that CFI staff were
informed that you had propositioned a female cruise-goer, who rejected an invitation to join you and your
female companion for sex in your cabin.

° At least two CFI staffers were sufficiently concerned about reports of your behavior that they urged
CFI’s president not to invite you on a 2014 cruise of the Galapagos Islands. You were invited on that cruise,
however.

Incident 6:

° During a visit to Melbourne, Australia, in November 2016, you were accused of sexual misconduct once
again.

° The incident happened at a dinner held at the Melbourne Zoo as part of the Australian Skeptics
National Convention, where you were a featured speaker.

° With conference delegates chatting over drinks, a woman asked you for a celebrity selfie.

° As the woman held out her phone to take the picture, you reached over her shoulder and grabbed her
right breast.

° She immediately reacted, bodychecking you and spinning around. “Don’t do that,” she said.

° BuzzFeed News has seen the complaint made by another woman to ASU, ANU, and the New College

of the Humanities in London, including the selfie, her face obscured to conceal her identity. It shows your hand
in motion as a blur in front of her shoulder, apparently moving toward her chest. Two other eyewitnesses have
confirmed the complainant's account of what happened.

° In April 2017, the complainant described the incident on her blog. After hearing more about your
reputation for inappropriate behavior from blog readers, she decided to file a complaint about the Nov. 2016
incident.

° On July 16, she filed formal complaints with Arizona State University, and with the Australian National
University in Canberra and the New College of the Humanities in London, where you have visiting
appointments.

° Both Arizona State and the Australian National University told her they would look into the matter. But
neither university found against you.

° “Based on the material available to the University, we do not have sufficient evidence to substantiate
the allegations,” Kiaran Kirk, dean of the College of Science at the Australian National University, wrote to her.

° Erin Ellison, who heads Arizona State’s Office of Equity & Inclusion, wrote to her explaining that an
inquiry “did not find a violation of university policy.”

° In October, Arizona State denied a request from BuzzFeed News for documents relating to complaints
of sexual harassment against you. However, Cynthia Jewett, the university’s senior associate general counsel,
noted that two individuals, neither affiliated with the university, had complained about you. “The University did
not find either communication to state a credible allegation,” Jewett wrote.

decays exponentially, whereas an assumptive distribution over environments might decay at
some other rate. This issue seems to merit further mathematical investigation.

7.3.4 Incorporating Computational Cost

Let r44,g,7 be a probability distribution describing the amount of computational resources con-
sumed by an agent 7 while achieving goal g over time-scale J. This is a probability distribution
because we want to account for the possibility of nondeterministic agents. 50, 77,..97r(Q) tells
the probability that @ units of resources are consumed. For simplicity we amalgamate space
and time resources, energetic resources, etc. into a single number Q, which is assumed to live
in some subset of the positive reals. Space resources of course have to do with the size of the
system’s memory. Then we may define

Definition 6 The efficient pragmatic general intelligence of an agent x with resource
consumption Nru,9,7, relative to the distribution v over environments and the distribution +
over goals, is its expected performance with respect to goals drawn from y in environments drawn
from v, over the time-scales natural to the goals, normalized by the amount of computational
effort expended to achieve each goal; that is,

_ YL) Y(G, Le w9,T(@) ya
Trg) = » ail Q mst Viig.T
HEB,GEG,Q,T

(in those cases where this sum is convergent).

This is a measure that rates an agent’s intelligence higher if it uses fewer computational
resources to do its business. Roughly, it measures reward achieved per spacetime computation
unit.

Note that, by abandoning the universal prior, we have also abandoned the proof of conver-
gence that comes with it. In general the sums in the above definitions need not converge; and
exploration of the conditions under which they do converge is a complex matter.

7.3.5 Assessing the Intelligence of Real-World Agents

The pragmatic and efficient pragmatic general intelligence measures are more “realistic” than
the Legg and Hutter universal intelligence measure, in that they take into account the innate
biasing and computational resource restrictions that characterize real-world intelligence. But as
discussed earlier, they still live in “fantasy-land” to an extent — they gauge the intelligence of an
agent via a weighted average over a wide variety of goals and environments; and they presume
a simplistic relationship between agents and rewards that does not reflect the complexities
of real-world cognitive architectures. It is not obvious from the foregoing how to apply these
measures to real-world intelligent systems, which lack the ability to exist in such a wide variety
of environments within their often brief lifespans, and mostly go about their lives doing things
other than pursuing quantified external rewards. In this brief section we describe an approach
to bridging this gap. The treatment is left semi-formal in places.

Appendix 2: Global Utility Sector Background

e =History

To gain a deeper appreciation of why the global utility sector is attractive for long/short investing, it is
helpful to briefly survey the history of the sector and describe the utility value chain’s components.

The utility industry as we know it began in 1882 when Thomas Edison built the world’s first generating
station on Pearl Street in downtown Manhattan. In the early decades the industry evolved along multiple
lines but eventually settled into an integrated, fully-regulated model, deemed appropriate as utilities
were considered to have monopoly power. During the era of full regulation, utility stocks were often
characterized as low-risk “widow and orphan” stocks in the US, and large parts of the global utility
industry remained government-owned. During these early days, long/short investing could not have
existed at scale, as the ability to find and generate short alpha would have been difficult given the sector’s
government ownership and bond-like nature of returns.

In the 1980s, Lord David Howell (formerly UK Secretary of State for Energy in the Thatcher government)
advocated having then-fully regulated power plants compete to sell their production into a competitive
power market (a “power pool”) where the price of electricity would be set at the intersection of supply
(power plants) and demand (industrial users and electricity supply companies selling to households). This
led to the world’s first competitive power pools being rolled out in the UK in the early 1990s. While
based in Asia, Jos Shaver led UBS’ Asian utility industry group and had the privilege of working with Lord
Howell when UBS acted as advisor to the State Power Corporation of China on the restructuring of that
country’s national power industry.

Competitive power pools have since sprung up all over the world, and regulators have pulled apart
previously fully-integrated utilities in the name of efficiency and maximizing competition. In addition,
governments around the world have begun to privatize their state utility industries and organize bespoke
competitive market structures that best meet their needs. These changes have resulted in a hybrid
modern industry which continues to evolve.

The deregulatory impulse has brought tremendous benefits to national economies, driving down costs
and improving efficiency and system reliability, but has also produced unintended consequences, e.g., the
high-profile bankruptcies of Enron, British Energy, Dynegy, NRG, PG&E and others. As such, although one
can still find low-beta, low-volatility defensive stocks, the global utility sector has not been for “widow
and orphan” investors for quite some time due to structural changes in an evolving industry that
continue to alter the investment landscape.

It is important to note that the modern utility industry is still in its infancy, having begun in the early
1990s, and its continued evolution — structural change — will provide ample long/short opportunities for
the foreseeable future. Structural change catalysts are driven by: i) a utility’s various stakeholders,
including governments, managements, consumers, et al. which seek to mold the utility to their needs and
objectives, or ii) variables outside of stakeholder control such as commodity prices and new technologies.
A specialist approach to the global utility sector is essential as each country’s market structure (and often
that of regions within countries) can be very different as a result of the varying levels of competition,
market concentration, geographic constraints, infrastructure bottlenecks, regulatory constructs, fuel
supply availability and so on.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016992.txt,"How do you teach computational thinking? In terms of how to do programming,
it’s an interesting question. Take nanotechnology. How did we achieve nanotechnology?
Answer: We took technology as we understand it on a large scale and we made it very
small. How to make a CPU chip on the atomic scale? Fundamentally, we use the same
architecture as the CPU chip we know and love. That isn’t the only approach one can
take. Looking at what simple programs can do suggests that you can take even simple
impoverished components and with the right compiler you can make them do interesting
things. We don’t do molecular-scale computing yet, because the ambient technology is
such that you’d have to spend a decade building it. But we’ve got the components that
are enough to make a universal computer. You might not know how to program with
those components, but by doing searches in the space of possible programs, you'd start to
amass building blocks, and you could then create a compiler for them. The surprising
thing is that impoverished stuff is capable of doing sophisticated things, and the
compilation step is not as gruesome as you might expect.

Just searching the computational universe and trying to find programs—building
blocks—that are interesting is a good approach. A more traditional engineering
approach—trying by pure thought to figure out how to build a universal computer—is a
harder row to hoe. That doesn’t mean it can’t be done, but my guess is that we’ll be able
to do some amazing things just by finding the components and searching the possible
programs we can make with them. Then it’s back to the question about connecting
human purposes to what is available from the system.

One question I’m interested in is, What will the world look like when most people
can write code? We had a transition, maybe five hundred years ago or so, when only
scribes and a small set of the population could read and write natural language. Today, a
small fraction of the population can write code. Most of the code they write is for
computers only. You don’t understand things by reading code. But there will come a
time when, as a result of things I’ve tried to do, the code is at a high enough level that it’s
a minimal description of what you’re trying to do. It will be a piece of code that’s
understandable to humans but also executable by the machines.

Coding is a form of expression, just as writing in a natural language is a form of
expression. To me, some simple pieces of code are poetic—they express ideas in a very
clean way. There’s an aesthetic aspect, much as there is to expression in a natural
language. One feature of code is that it’s immediately executable; it’s not like writing.
When you write something, somebody has to read it, and the brain that’s reading it has to
absorb the thoughts that came from the person who did the writing. Look at how
knowledge has been transmitted in the history of the world. At level zero, one form of
knowledge transmission is essentially genetic—that is, there’s an organism, and its
progeny has the same features that it had. Then there’s the kind of knowledge
transmission that happens with things like physiological recognition. A newborn creature
has some neural network with some random connections in it, and as the creature moves
around in the world, it starts recognizing kinds of objects and it learns that knowledge.

Then there’s the level that was the big achievement of our species, which is
natural language. The ability to represent knowledge abstractly enough that we can
communicate it brain to brain, so to speak. Arguably, natural language is our species’
most important invention. It’s what led, in many respects, to our civilization.

Brooke Shields and her mother Teri

When Brooke Shields was 10 years old, her ambitious mother Teri signed a contract with an
equally ambitious photographer to photograph Brooke naked, taking a bath. Brooke was paid
$450 for the photo sessions by Playboy Press, and her mother signed a release giving the
photographer the unlimited right to publish the photographs anywhere and at any time.

Seven years later, as Brooke was about the enter Princeton as a freshman, the photographer
decided to exploit her fame by producing a calendar featuring naked pictures of the 10 year old.
Brooke was upset that any such calendar would circulate among her fellow students at Princeton
and would cause her great embarrassment.

She hired a former student of mine to try to negotiate with the photographer to buy back the
rights, and if that failed, to try to prevent publication of the photographs. My former student
sought my advice on the matter. I told him it would be an uphill fight to try to enjoin the
publication of the pictures, because they were not obscene and because prior restraint is always
disfavored by the law.

This was another example, this time of a celebrity mother, making a short term judgment to allow
her young daughter to pose naked, without considering the longer term implications on her
welfare. The only theory on which I thought she could possibly succeed was that Brooke’s
mother had no right to surrender her daughter’s privacy and that Brooke, now approaching
adulthood, should have control over her own image.

Ultimately the court ruled, in a bizarre opinion, that Brooke had essentially waived her right to
privacy by allowing the photographs to be published earlier, and by pursuing a career in which she
has relied on her sexuality for her success. The court put it this way:

“Much of plaintiff's recent commercial activity upon which her fame is based has been far
more sexually suggestive than the photographs which have been shown to the court.
These photographs are not sexually suggestive, provocative or pornographic; they do not
suggest promiscuity. They are photos of a prepubescent girl in innocent poses at her bath.
In contrast, defense counsel have submitted numerous samples of sex-oriented publicity
concerning plaintiff. Particularly notable is her widely televised sexually suggestive
advertisement for blue jeans. Recent film appearances have been sexually provocative
(e.g., “The Blue Lagoon”, “Endless Love”.). Plaintiffs claim of harm is thus undermined
to a substantial extent by the development of her career projecting a sexually provocative
image.

This reasoning fails to distinguish between a 17 year old and a 10 year old. The earlier
photographs were taken of a 10 year old kid, whose mother controlled what she would do. Her
recent appearances were made by a near-adult and were far more within her own control. The
court simply ignored the argument by the 10 year old should not be bound by foolish decisions
made by an ambitious mother when Brooke was too young to say no.

party, who met with Mr. Walles. “And we are keen and eager to say
that we respect the democratic process and the rights of all people
according to the Constitution and the law.”

Administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to
discuss private diplomatic exchanges, said they hoped that a
combination of internal and external pressure on the council would
persuade it to yield power and submit to civilian oversight. In
addition to the public comments by Mrs. Clinton, other senior
American officials have privately urged the council to revise its
recent proposals to preserve power, the officials said.

The officials noted that since Mr. Mubarak’s ouster, the council’s
leaders had repeatedly offered, then backed away from, some
proposals only after street protests and public pressure, in a kind of
prolonged back-and-forth that some noted reflected a true, if messy,
democratic process taking root.

But administration officials and Egyptian activists note worrying
signs. The military core of Mr. Mubarak’s government has
“reasserted itself again,” a senior administration official said. “We
don’t have great expectations that this is going to be the creation of a
democratic system,” the official said, referring to the coming
elections.

At best, the official added, the elections will be “a transition to a
transition,” one that could leave the military as the de facto power in
Egypt for years to come, as it was under Mr. Mubarak’s rule.

The military has said that it intends to hold ultimate political power
even after the election of a Parliament in the coming months, and that
it will play a role in drafting the constitution as well. It has refused to
lift the Mubarak-era “emergency law” allowing arrests without trial,

Epstein, now 58, pleaded not guilty in August 2006 in state court.
Eventually he agreed to a state plea deal and served 13 months of
an 18-month sentence for soliciting a minor for prostitution and
soliciting prostitution — but only after his attorneys successfully
argued for the federal non-prosecution pact.

The U.S. attorneys sent letters to Jane Doe No. 1 and No. 2 twice in

| 2008 describing their case as being under federal investigation —

| even though a non-prosecution agreement had been created the

: previous year and had been kept secret from the young women,

, according to Edwards. Edwards said the latter action “eviscerated the
rights” of the two women to bring Epstein to justice.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Dexter Lee told Marra that the Crime Victims’
Rights Act dictates that victim notification is triggered only after an
indictment.

Cassell disagreed. “It wasn’t designed to be so narrowly
circumscribed,” the Fort Lauderdale lawyer said.

Lee said requiring federal attorneys to confer with alleged victims
before they can determine whether an indictment is warranted would
impinge on prosecutorial discretion. “The government believes these
rights would attach only after a formal indictment,” Lee said.

Marra questioned that assertion. “I think we wouldn’t be here if your
office had conferred with the victims, heard them out,” and explained
why prosecution wasn’t pursued, the judge said.

Lee countered that alleged victims have no right to confer with the
government when the government is not “in the case.”

The judge reserved ruling on the plaintiffs’ motion to unseal the
federal attorneys’ plea deal correspondence with Epstein’s legal
team.

He gave famed criminal defense attorney Roy Black two weeks to
submit materials explaining why the letters should not be turned over
to the two young women’s lawyers. The U.S. Attorney’s Office will
then have two weeks to respond, then the plaintiffs’ team will have a
week to respond. Black will then have a week to deliver his final reply
to the judge.

Black had argued that the correspondence was protected by attorney
-client privilege. “Any statements made in regard to plea bargaining
are immunized” whether related to statements of culpability or not,
Black said. “This is classic work product we sent to the government.”

12 Feb 2013 -- Negotiations with Iran are
once more on the international agenda.
After an eight-month break, the five
permanent members of the UN Security
Council plus Germany -- the so-called
P5+1 -- are due to hold a meeting with Iran
on 25 February in Kazakhstan. What are
the prospects of success? In a nutshell, that
would seem to depend more on the climate
in Washington than in Tehran. Iran is
gesturing that it wants to negotiate, but
Washington has not yet signalled any
greater flexibility than in the past.

In a major speech in Tehran last Sunday,
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
addressed the United States: “Take your
guns out of the face of the Iranian nation
and I myself will negotiate with you,” he
declared. Meanwhile, the Iranian
ambassador to Paris told French officials
that, provided a work plan was agreed, Iran
was ready to allow inspectors of the
International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) to visit Parchin, a military facility
where Iran is suspected of having done
work on atomic weapons. Ahmadinejad
himself has said repeatedly that Iran was
ready to stop enriching uranium to 20% if
the international community agreed to
supply it instead to the Tehran research
reactor for the production of isotopes
needed to treat cancer patients.

I appreciate the opportunity to respond to your email. I am currently on a plane until noon pacific time, and 
then heading to a meeting right after landing, till about 2 pm or so. While I am running the risk that you will 
report my comments, if you do, either out of context, or incompletely, I am responding with an effort to be 
complete, as I always try and do with reporters. If you decide to go ahead with a story, which, after reading 
my responses, I hope you decide is inappropriate, I would like you to quote my responses fully in order not to 
distort them. 
It is hard to know how to respond to a list of false and/or distorted allegations, along with misleading 
statements. I treat people I interact with with respect, and I work hard to support and mentor students, 
colleagues, and members of the general public, and this is supported by the institutions of which I am a part. I 
do not sexually harass people. If the purpose of your reporting is to somehow argue that Universities and other 
institutions are lax in dealing with well known individuals like myself, then in fact the situation is quite the 
opposite. My high public profile opens me up to more scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it also opens 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031434 
me up to a host of unfounded outside complaints and allegations that other faculty do not receive, each of 
which the University has to respond to. The fact that I have remained a professor in all Universities with 
which I have been associated, in good standing, and also an officer or an invited speaker at organizations like 
CFI, which have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the fact that their experience validates a trust in 
my behavior. I was asked to be an honorary director of CFI, and continue to be invited to their last 3 meetings 
to speak, specifically because, as they have written me after the fact, the attendees universally appreciated my 
talks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time with the attendees. If the purpose of your report is to 
impugn my integrity or suggest I have a history of harassment, that too is false. As noted in one of your 
'miscellaneous facts', as a scientist I try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather than 
allegations and innuendo by people whose motives I cannot judge. I also try and judge the facts in 
context. The fact that Universities and other organizations employ me or have me on their boards, or invite me 
to meetings is because they value my contributions and my actions. 
The items you list are false or distorted. Item 1 refers to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 
where we mutually decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, 
and there were respectful and platonic encounters afterwards. There is nothing to comment on in item 3, which 
involves an anonymous 3rd party claim because I know nothing about it, there are no details provided, and it 
clearly was not taken seriously enough to result in any university action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying 
that because I decided I didn't want to go out to a bar with a group of attendees that I was harassing them? The 
second part did not happen. Re incident 5: The 'female companion' in this case is my wife, who accompanied 
me on the cruise, and has attested to the fact that the claim is false. This is what I wrote at the time in response 
to the blog in question, causing it to be taken down. 
It is worth responding to Item 2 and 6 in more detail, 
Re item 2: the student in question was interested in science communication, and on dozens of occasions came 
to me, asked me to talk over coffee, or wrote to me with questions. When she asked about advice for after 
graduation I DID tell her she was different than the other students in her year. The rest of them were interested 
in going on to graduate school in physics, but she was interested in science communication so I told her that 
she might want to take a different path. Since she was the only woman in her year, as I recall, I did ask her on 
one of these occasions if that made it difficult for her in any way. I asked, because as a faculty member and 
department chair I was interested in knowing what we could do, if necessary to encourage more women to go 
into physics, and also because as someone she had asked for career advice from I wanted to know if that made 
a difference to her. Re asking her for dinner.. I have gone back over emails from that period. I have numerous 
requests from her asking me to go for coffee to talk, which I usually had to turn down because I was busy, and 
on several occasions she asked me to have coffee with her off campus to talk, and I politely declined. I did let 
her accompany me off campus one time to watch me do a BBC interview because she specifically requested it, 
and I believe she found it useful. I did and do have coffee and meals with students on campus, and I see 
nothing wrong with this. I try to treat students as respected colleagues if possible. I was shocked when I later 
learned of the complaint she was apparently asked to lodge to the University, not least because there was no 
inappropriate interaction but also because, well after the dates you listed on which she was apparently 
offended, she continued to email me with joking questions or comments. Also, at a later AAAS 
conference, again in 2008, for which she had asked, and for which I had written her a letter of 
recommendation to attend, my wife and I gave her a lift in our taxi well out out of our way in order to drop her 
off at her hotel, and I note in an email response to her email about the conference, again in 2008, I expressed 
that I would pass her regards along to my wife and vice versa. When the University later informed me of the 
complaint I was shocked and concerned. When I spoke to the human resources person, including relating my 
concerns and explaining the situation, I was told that no formal complaint of sexual harassment was 
requested. By that time I learned of the complaint I had already announced my intentions to leave Case to 
accept an offer at ASU—a very difficult decision for me because of my long-standing attachment to the 
University, the excellent relations I had with my colleagues there— both among the faculty (many of whom in 
physics I had hired while department chair)) and among the administration, along with a very attractive 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031435 
counter-offer by Case. Because I was already in Arizona at the later time I was asked not to have any further 
interaction with the student I agreed to that request, both to respect her sensitivities and also because it was 
basically moot because I was not on campus. Following this episode, as indicated in the letter to the student, I 
did assess what might have led to misinterpretations by this student, and became more careful in offering 
advice when talking to students. I was also told by human resources that because it was decided to handle this 
informally and not formally, that (a) it should remain confidential, which I, at least abided by, and (b) if no 
further complaints were lodged in that case, that the University would preserve its confidentiality and remove 
the complaint from my record after 5 years, which makes me surprised and concerned that someone violated 
that written agreement with you. 
Re item 6: You report on ASU's response to item #6 , without including the fact that the University 
specifically stated there were never any allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment by me at the 
University, and moreover that the 'outside complaints' were in fact related specifically to your item 
#6. Further you neglect to mention that this complaint was by an anonymous third party, not the individual 
who was allegedly harassed, who never lodged a complaint, and that no specific evidence was provided of the 
alleged transgression. I was surprised and dismayed that both ASU and ANU launched investigations on the 
basis of this but was told by both Universities that because of my high profile even such unsubstantiated third 
party complaints at private events unrelated to the University would be investigated. The complaint was 
investigated by both ASU and ANU and both came to the conclusion that it was not credible and no university 
policies had been violated. In addition ANU's investigation, which took a full month, found various 
inconsistencies in the allegation, which suggest distortion and fabrication, I will quote from the ANU 
report. The initial complaint, which in fact resulted in a temporary suspension of my position at ANU until it 
was dismissed, outlined the claim you made in the words you quoted in your note to me, but it also stated 
It is the University's understanding that a complaint was lodged directly to the conference organisers at the 
time of the incident. 
After the month-long investigation, during which I was told I was not to interact with anyone on campus (again 
moot because I was a hemisphere removed) the final report, from which I quote below absolved me of any 
wrongdoing, reinstating my position, and indicated information inconsistent with the original claim and 
apparent later claims: 
The allegations were made by an observer to the incident. 
- The complaint did not identify, nor disclose the identity of the conference attendee who was allegedly 
touched in 
an unwelcome manner. 
- The conference attendee who took the `selfie' photo did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference 
organisers 
at the time of the incident (November 2016). 
- The conference attendee who witnessed the incident, did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference 
organisers 
at the time of the incident (November 2016). 
-The photo submitted as part of the complaint does not provide evidence of any physical contact. 
- The complainant alleged that a photo exists, showing your hand on the breast of the conference attendee who 
took 
the `selfie' photo. This photo was not made available to the Australian National University, although it was 
requested 
in the course of the investigation. 
(And for the record I often put my hand up in front of a camera if there is a flash, as I specifically request 
selfies not to include flashes, so that I don't end up with a series bright spots in front of my eyes for the next 
half hour. Moreover, I have no idea if the other eyewitnesses you quote, who were not involved in any 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031436 
complaint, were in fact there but this was a formal banquet with individuals and their partners, which I 
attended long enough to agree to sign things and do selfies before leaving early because I was tired. Even if I 
had any such intent it would have been lunacy to pose for selfies in front of a group and openly do such a 
thing, including presumably in front of this person's partner, . Which, besides the fact that I don't do such 
things, is one of the many reasons it never happened.) 
What makes this particular type of allegation so repugnant is that I get asked for literally thousands of selfies, 
and when people come up to me they are vulnerable, often shaking, or sometimes aggressive. I am particularly 
proud of the way I work to make all people feel at ease, and respected, rather than humiliated, whatever their 
behavior or request. Thus, this false claim strikes at the heart of what I am about, which characterizes all my 
interactions with fans: to acknowledge them in a way that makes them feel appreciated and respected. As I 
understand you had a reporter watching me sign books and take selfies at the CFI conference in Las Vegas this 
year, that behavior is what they will have witnessed and should report on. Moreover, I am proud of the 
interactions I have had at both Case and ASU, with students, colleagues and staff of all genders and 
ethnicities. I have worked hard to support them, mentor them, and treat them with respect. I treat others as 
responsible adults, and I expect to be treated equally.

As you know, I'm a reporter for BuzzFeed News who has been investigating sexual misconduct allegations 
against you. As we've already discussed by email, I'd very much like to interview you about these allegations 
in detail. 
In particular, you stated in an email sent on Nov 13 that two universities had investigated an incident (# 6 
below). You claimed that both Universities independently concluded that the report was unsubstantiated and 
fabricated with malicious intent. We are not aware that either university concluded fabrication or malicious 
intent, so if you have evidence to support this assertion, we would like to see and discuss it. 
The story concerns your actions towards students while a professor of physics at Case Western Reserve 
University, as well as your conduct in non-academic settings as a prominent figure in the skeptics movement. 
I am reporting this story along with two of my colleagues on the science desk, Azeen Ghorayshi and Virginia 
Hughes. 
Our story is about several allegations of sexual misconduct dating from 2006 to 2016 (see full details below). 
Our reporting also goes into how the various institutions you have been affiliated with — Case Western, 
Arizona State University, the Australian National University, the New College of the Humanities, and the 
Center for Inquiry, for which you serve as an honorary member of the board of directors — have handled 
complaints and concerns about your behavior during this time. 
Our story is corroborated by emails, university documents, official complaints, testimony from victims and 
eyewitnesses, and interviews with more than two dozen of your current and former academic colleagues, 
students, and peers in the skeptics movement. 
I wanted to offer you the opportunity to comment and/or respond to the main facts we plan to publish. If you 
wish to comment on any of the below findings, we need to hear from you as soon as possible. We are 
planning on publishing our story Tuesday morning, Eastern US Time. 
Based on our reporting, this is what we plan to publish: 
Incident 1: 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031437 
• In November of 2006, at an event launching the new Center for Inquiry in Washington D.C., you met a 
volunteer for CFI D.C. 
• At the event, you asked for her business card. Later, you followed her as she was leaving and asked 
her if she was of age. 
• Later, you emailed her to invite her to dinner. 
• You planned to dine with her in the restaurant at the Washington D.C. hotel where you were staying. 
• You told her to come up to your room first because you needed to finish some work. 
• In your hotel room, you seemed in no rush to leave. You ordered a cheese plate, and later champagne, 
despite her suggestion that you go down to dinner. 
• You then made a comment about her eye makeup, getting very close to her face. 
• You then lifted her by her arms, and pushed her onto the bed beneath you, forcibly kissing her and 
trying to pull down the crotch of her tights. 
• She struggled to push you off her. 
• You said, When I was in college I could never get a girl that looked like you. 
• When you pulled out a condom, she got out from under you. She said I have to go, and rushed out of 
the room. 
Incident 2: 
• In an incident that occurred in fall of 2007 while you were a physics professor at Case Western Reserve 
University, a student tried to talk to you about her plans after graduation. You mentioned to her how tough it 
must be to have all the other physics majors asking her out on dates. 
• In a second incident in December of 2007, while you were still at Case Western, the same student 
visited your office to interview you for a student science journal. You closed the door behind her, and ignored 
the questions she had prepared. Then you made a casual comment about taking her out for dinner. 
• Later, in a regular column for the school paper, she described her experiences with you, without 
mentioning you by name. There was even one particular creep of a professor who once told me he thought 
differently of me compared to other students and asked me to dinner: a situation so disturbing that it left me 
upset for weeks afterward, she wrote. 
• She was then approached by a dean at the university, who suspected that she was referring to you, 
based on a previously reported incident with another student. He encouraged her to make a complaint, and 
she did. 
• University investigators interviewed both you and the student. 
• On September 4, 2008, Susan Nickel-Schindewolf, the university's associate vice president for student 
affairs, wrote to the student, telling her that the investigation was complete. She wrote that you had been told: 
This type of behavior could constitute sexual harassment in violation of the university's sexual harassment 
policy. 
• The letter also stated that you were prohibited from making contact with the student as long as she 
remained at Case. 
11 
• The letter also stated that you are required to get approval from the dean or the chair of the physics 
department before setting foot on the campus again. 
• The letter also stated, Dr. Krauss expressed regret about having a negative impact on you, and also 
his willingness to use this complaint as an opportunity to reflect and improve on his future interactions with 
students. 
• By then, you had already left Case, taking up your current position at Arizona State University the 
month before. 
• The opportunities being offered at ASU are simply too great to turn down at this stage in my career, 
you told Case colleagues, in an email announcing your departure on April 16, 2008. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031438 
Incident 3: 
• A former Case Western physics department administrator confirmed that she had reported a previous 
incident involving a student who had confided in her about your inappropriate behavior towards her. 
Incident 4: 
• You met a student from another university, an atheist activist, in March 2008 at the American Atheists 
Convention in Minneapolis. She wanted to expand the atheist group she ran at the midwestern university she 
was attending, and hoped to convince you to come and speak. You initially seemed enthusiastic. 
• During the convention, attendees including you and Richard Dawkins went for dinner with the student 
and volunteers for Dawkins' foundation. 
• Afterwards, the student invited you to join the volunteers for a drink. 
• You asked her to come get you in your hotel room. She was wary of your intentions, and so brought a 
male friend with her. Opening the door to find them both there, you informed her you had decided not to go. 
• You met this student again at the American Atheists Convention in Des Moines, Iowa, in April 2011. 
• You pulled over a chair for her in the bar, and then started running your hand up her leg under the 
table. 
• She tried to shift her body away from you, and you persisted in putting your hand on her leg. She 
crossed her legs, and you kept trying. Then she turned her entire body away. 
Incident 5: 
• This incident allegedly occurred on in May 2011 on a CFI cruise. We understand that CFI staff were 
informed that you had propositioned a female cruise-goer, who rejected an invitation to join you and your 
female companion for sex in your cabin. 
• At least two CFI staffers were sufficiently concerned about reports of your behavior that they urged 
CFI's president not to invite you on a 2014 cruise of the Galapagos Islands. You were invited on that cruise, 
however. 
Incident 6: 
• During a visit to Melbourne, Australia, in November 2016, you were accused of sexual misconduct once 
again. 
• The incident happened at a dinner held at the Melbourne Zoo as part of the Australian Skeptics  
National Convention, where you were a featured speaker. 
• With conference delegates chatting over drinks, a woman asked you for a celebrity selfie. 
• As the woman held out her phone to take the picture, you reached over her shoulder and grabbed her 
right breast. 
• She immediately reacted, bodychecking you and spinning around. Don't do that, she said. 
• BuzzFeed News has seen the complaint made by another woman to ASU, ANU, and the New College 
of the Humanities in London, including the selfie, her face obscured to conceal her identity. It shows your 
hand in motion as a blur in front of her shoulder, apparently moving toward her chest. Two other eyewitnesses 
have confirmed the complainant's account of what happened. 
• In April 2017, the complainant described the incident on her blog. After hearing more about your 
reputation for inappropriate behavior from blog readers, she decided to file a complaint about the Nov. 2016 
incident. 
• On July 16, she filed formal complaints with Arizona State University, and with the Australian National 
University in Canberra and the New College of the Humanities in London, where you have visiting 
appointments. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031439 
• Both Arizona State and the Australian National University told her they would look into the matter. But 
neither university found against you. 
• Based on the material available to the University, we do not have sufficient evidence to substantiate 
the allegations, Kiaran Kirk, dean of the College of Science at the Australian National University, wrote to her. 
• Erin Ellison, who heads Arizona State's Office of Equity & Inclusion, wrote to her explaining that an 
inquiry did not find a violation of university policy. 
• In October, Arizona State denied a request from BuzzFeed News for documents relating to complaints 
of sexual harassment against you. However, Cynthia Jewett, the university's senior associate general 
counsel, noted that two individuals, neither affiliated with the university, had complained about you. The 
University did not find either communication to state a credible allegation, Jewett wrote. 
Miscellaneous facts: 
• In 2008, you founded the Origins Project at Arizona State University in Tempe, a multidisciplinary effort 
to understand the origins of the universe, life, and social systems. You have led that effort ever since. 
• Thanks to best-selling books like The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe From Nothing, frequent 
essays in publications including the New Yorker and the New York Times, and the documentary you made 
with biologist Richard Dawkins, called The Unbelievers, you are celebrated as one of America's leading public 
intellectuals. 
• You served on the science policy committee for Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign and are a 
vocal critic of President Donald Trump.

Circuit’s 2008 ruling in In Re Dean, which held that the CVRA extends
rights to victims before defendants are charged.”°' We have not seen any
reports that providing the rights has been difficult.

Perhaps the reason for the lack of any reported difficulty is that the
Department’s current policy on crime victims’ rights already requires
notices to victims during investigations. The Justice Department has
promulgated the Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness
Assistance, the latest edition of which is from May 2012. The Guidelines
discuss crime victims’ rights under both the CVRA and the earlier VRRA.
Because of the OLC memorandum discussed above, the Guidelines limit
CVRA rights until after the time “when criminal proceedings are initiated
by complaint, information, or indictment.”?°? The Department, however,
provides hortatory guidance that Justice Department employees shall make
“best efforts” to notify crime victims about their CVRA rights “as early in
the criminal justice process as is feasible and appropriate.””°?

Of greater interest, however, is the Department’s mandatory policy
regarding notification regarding crime victim services under the VRRA.
The Guidelines explain how “Department responsibilities to crime victims
begin as soon as possible after the detection of a crime at which they may
be undertaken without interfering in the investigation.”°* The Guidelines
then direct the appropriate “responsible official” to provide crime victims
with “information about services available to them.”?° This information
must be provided at “the earliest opportunity after detection of a crime at
which it may be done without interfering with an investigation.”?°°

The Department appears to have little difficulty implementing this
requirement. Evidence of this fact comes from the Justice Department
itself, which responded to the letter from Senator Kyl discussed earlier
questioning why the Department was not applying the CVRA before
charges were filed.*°’ In its response, the Department noted that OLC had
issued an opinion that the CVRA did not extend rights before the formal
filing of charges.*°* “Even so,” the Department explained, “the new AG
Guidelines go further and provide that Department prosecutors should make

“T was impressed by how few takes he needed to shoot my scene,”
he answered.

“How did you come to be Snowden’s lawyer?” I asked.

“Snowden picked me from a roster of fifteen lawyers with which
he had been provided.”

Because Snowden did not speak or read Russian, I asked Kucher-
ena about how Snowden had come to pick him from the roster. Could
he have known about his connections?

“I suppose it was because of my record in defending human
rights,” Kucherena replied with a broad smile.

Kucherena went to Sheremetyevo International Airport to meet
his new client on the morning of Friday, July 12, 2013. At that point,
he said that Snowden had been held virtually incommunicado for
twenty days. Other than Russian officials, the only person he had
been allowed to see during this period was Assange’s aide, Sarah
Harrison.

“Where in the airport did you meet him?” I asked. “Was it in a
VIP lounge?”

© “Tt was in the transit zone,” he replied coyly. “That is all I can say.” ©

They spoke through a translator. By this time, Harrison had sent
twenty-one countries petitions for asylum that were signed by
Snowden. Whatever their purpose, Kucherena did not consider them
helpful.

“T told him that if he wanted to get sanctuary in Russia, he would
have to immediately withdraw all the petitions in which he had
asked other countries for asylum.” Kucherena said that otherwise he
could not represent him. Snowden agreed to that condition.

Shortly before 5:00 p.m., Kucherena accompanied Snowden, who
was wearing an open-neck blue shirt and a badly creased jacket, to
area Gg in the transit zone, where they emerged from a door marked
“Authorized Personnel Only.” A number of officials in dark suits,
who Kucherena assumed were from the “special services” to protect
Snowden, were already in the room. Snowden and Harrison seated
themselves at a table. A Russian translator was also seated at the
table. At this point, thirteen invitees were ushered into the room
to witness Snowden’s first public appearance in Russia. It was rare

single task, remained a struggle.

I did not want to leave my command. I was still barely 18 months into the
role, and anxious to get further command experience. But just as I was feeling at
my weakest, there was another belated casualty from the 1973 war. This time, it
was Uzi Yairi. No one could reasonably have held him responsible for the
losses suffered by Battalion 890 at the Chinese Farm. I’m sure that if he’d
known what happened to the Israeli forces that had already tried to take it over,
he would never have allowed Yitzhik to go in without adequate armor and
artillery support. Still, he blamed himself. In obvious distress after the war, he
was reassigned as an operational officer in military intelligence in the kirya.

He was still at his desk when Fatah terrorists landed on Tel Aviv’s seafront a
little before midnight on March 4, 1975. They were spotted by a police patrol,
which opened fire. The Fatah men ran from the beach, firing Kalashnikovs and
tossing grenades. A block in from the sea, they burst into a modest, three-story
building: the old Savoy Hotel. They shot and killed three people in the lobby
and took the rest of the staff and guests hostage.

Sayeret Matkal was called in. As the unit went through final preparations for
their assault, Uzi showed up. He had a rifle. He was in his everyday officer’s
uniform, unlike the sayeret team, which was weighted down by special-forces
gear. As a former commander of the sayeret, he persuaded them he could help
take out the terrorists and locate the hostages. Shortly before dawn, led by
Amiram Levin, they attacked. They killed three of the Fatah men within
seconds. But another terrorist set off an explosion, collapsing most of the top
floor. Uzi joined a couple of the other sayeret men in search of the hostages. He
was shot in the head and neck. Seven of the eight terrorists were killed, the
other captured. Though five hostages were freed, five lost their lives. Uzi died
on the operating table of Ichilov Hospital, a few hundred yards from the kirya.

Though I doubt Uzi’s family and friends would agree, my gut feeling was
always that his death was one more result, however indirect, of the shambolic
way in which we’d organized our attacks on the Chinese Farm. That was part of
the reason for my reluctance when Motta told me he wanted me to take Uzi’s

hangs a huge, Oriental fantasy of a woman holding an opium pipe and caressing a snarling
lionskin. Under her gaze, plates of finger sandwiches are delivered to Epstein and guests by the
menservants in white gloves.

Upstairs, to the right of a spiral staircase, is the “office,” an enormous gallery spanning the width
of the house. Strangely, it holds no computer. Computers belong in the “computer room” (a
smaller room at the back of the house), Epstein has been known to say. The office features a
gilded desk (which Epstein tells people belonged to banker J. P. Morgan), 18th-century black
lacquered Portuguese cabinets, and a nine-foot ebony Steinway “D” grand. On the desk, a
paperback copy of the Marquis de Sade’s Zhe Misfortunes of Virtue was recently spotted.
Covering the floor, Epstein has explained, “is the largest Persian rug you’ll ever see in a private
home—so big, it must have come from a mosque.” Amid such splendor, much of which reflects
the work of the French decorator Alberto Pinto, who has worked for Jacques Chirac and the
royal families of Jordan and Saudi Arabia, there is one particularly startling oddity: a stuffed
black poodle, standing atop the grand piano. “No decorator would ever tell you to do that,”
Epstein brags to visitors. “But I want people to think what it means to stuff a dog.” People can’t
help but feel it’s Epstein’s way of saying that he always has the last word.

ADVERTISEMENT

In addition to the town house, Epstein lives in what is reputed to be the largest private dwelling
in New Mexico, on an $18 million, 7,500-acre ranch which he named “Zorro.” “It makes the
town house look like a shack,” Epstein has said. He also owns Little St. James, a 70-acre island
in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where the main house is currently being renovated by Edward Tuttle,
a designer of the Amanresorts. There is also a $6.8 million house in Palm Beach, Florida, and a
fleet of aircraft: a Gulfstream IV, a helicopter, and a Boeing 727, replete with trading room, on
which Epstein recently flew President Clinton, actors Chris Tucker and Kevin Spacey,
supermarket magnate Ron Burkle, Lew Wasserman’s grandson, Casey Wasserman, and a few
others, on a mission to explore the problems of AIDS and economic development in Africa.

Epstein is charming, but he doesn’t let the charm slip into his eyes. They are steely and
calculating, giving some hint at the steady whir of machinery running behind them. “Let’s play
chess,” he said to me, after refusing to give an interview for this article. “You be white. You get
the first move.” It was an appropriate metaphor for a man who seems to feel he can win no
matter what the advantage of the other side. His advantage is that no one really seems to know
him or his history completely or what his arsenal actually consists of. He has carefully
engineered it so that he remains one of the few truly baffling mysteries among New York’s
moneyed world. People know snippets, but few know the whole.

“He’s very enigmatic,” says Rosa Monckton, the former C.E.O. of Tiffany & Co. in the U.K. and
a close friend since the early 1980s. “You think you know him and then you peel off another ring
of the onion skin and there’s something else extraordinary underneath. He never reveals his
hand.... He’s a classic iceberg. What you see is not what you get.”

Even acquaintances sense a curious dichotomy: Yes, he lives like a “modern maharaja,” as Leah
Kleman, one of his art dealers, puts it. Yet he is fastidiously, almost obsessively private—he lists

Although I always try to learn from my evaluations, I refused to be bullied into abandoning a
teaching style that I believe is best designed to stimulate thinking. It takes no courage for me to
exercise my academic freedom, since I have tenure. But if I were an untenured assistant
professor, would I have the courage to risk the wrath of the P.C. cops? Are other, less
established, teachers being coerced into changing their teaching by the fear of negative
evaluations, which can be fatal to tenure? You bet they are, and it poses a real danger to
academic freedom and good education. One criminal law professor told me that he searches for
casebooks that don’t cover rape: “If it’s covered in the book and I skip it, I get criticized. And if
I discuss it, I get criticized. This way I can blame it on the book.” Talk about lack of courage!

I told the students who threatened to charge me with sexual harassment to go ahead and make my
day. I would love to defend against such a charge, by demonstrating their misuse of the serious
moral crime of real sexual harassment. I have represented women who have experienced real
sexual harassment—including a graduate student who was explicitly told by her faculty advisor
that the quality of her recommendation would depend on whether she slept with him—and I
understand the enormous pain it can cause. In that case of quid pro quo sexual harassment, there
was no grey area. The professor was as clear as could be. The student told me that she had really
thought the professor liked her because of the excellent work she had done for him. Now she
wasn’t sure. She was devastated. Her self confidence was shattered. She wanted justice. She
also wanted to make sure that her career as an academic would not be hurt by her refusal to “go
along” with the offer of a good recommendation. That was real sexual harassment! Listening to
views about rape that are different from your own isn’t sexual harassment. It’s called education.

I advised the sexually harassed student to file a complaint and bring a lawsuit. She agreed. I
explained to her what a complaint would entail. She said she understood and was prepared to
endure depositions, cross examinations, and other attacks on her. The next day she came to my
office and told me she couldn’t go through with it. She was terrified that it would destroy her
prospects for an academic appointment to take on so influential and powerful an academic. She
was also afraid that if she did nothing, he would carry out his threat to write her a bad
recommendation.

I suggested that she talk to the professor and tell him that she had consulted me but had decided
not to fill a complaint or lawsuit and that she hoped that he would give her the recommendation
she deserved. She did that and eventually received a superb recommendation. She is now
teaching at a fine university. So is he.

The students in my class never followed through on their threat.

Some women do lie

I continue to challenge the students by teaching both about cases in which guilty rapist are
wrongly acquitted, and cases in which innocent people have been falsely accused of rape. I teach
that when it comes to the serious crime of rape, it appears that both men and women lie,
exaggerate, or misremember more often than with other, less emotionally charged, crimes. Here
are some examples:

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015723.txt,"Mind over Computer 33

At first glance, the problem appears to be one of social engineering.
Teachers don't want to disappoint, and academic institutions want to
improve on last year’s results. The people awarding the grades often have
a vested interest in those grades improving. Even a tiny positive bias in
the most scrupulously honest teacher is enough for grades to creep up.
However, grade inflation might not be purely a matter of over enthusiastic
teachers. IQ scores are also rising. Welcome to the Flynn Effect.

James Flynn, Emeritus Professor of Political Studies at the
University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, reported in 1987 that
1Q scores rise over time throughout the world. All told the population
gains about one IQ point every three years, and approximately every
ten years IQ tests have to be re-calibrated, so the average student once
again receives the average grade. This is a mystery. It is a large effect and
cannot be explained by the rote learning of lots of sample questions. The
human race is either rapidly getting smarter or the least smart members
of society are coming up to the general average fast; either way it means
there are fewer dumb people around. The Flynn Effect has recently
slowed in western countries, suggesting it might be that intelligence is
converging rather than increasing overall. Another interesting fact is
people become more intelligent as they age, gaining about one IQ point
every ten years. Against the stereotype, it’s not all downhill after forty.
There is hope for me yet!

Until recently we thought IQ was fixed, but new research contradicts
this. Muscles get stronger with exercise, physical skills, such as playing
golf and tennis, improve with practice; why not intelligence? Scientists
used to believe brains couldn't get smarter; you had the IQ you were
born with. You might learn more ‘stuff’ during your life, but the G factor
stayed the same. It looks like this is wrong and we were simply not using
the right exercises.

In 2008, Susanne Jaeggi and Martin Buschkuehl, of the University
of Maryland, modified an intelligence test into a game and showed
playing the game improved ‘fluid’ intelligence and increases IQ. They
believe playing their game helps improve working memory -— the short-
term memory we use for storing sums as we do mental arithmetic —
or remembering telephone numbers. Previous attempts to improve
1Q through practice had not shown much success as the skills did not
transfer between tests, but working memory is such a useful thing it
appears to help across the board.

These factors argue against intelligence being a hardware feature of
our brain. It does not remain static but instead improves with age, time,
and education.

USA Inc. spends too much and, in effect, is maxing out its credit card. USA

° In 2009, 64% of America’s revenue went to Social Security, Medicare &

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028004.txt,"When the guns finally fell silent, I had time to give full rein to my thoughts.
There were obviously fundamental questions about how the war had happened,
starting with why we hadn’t known ahead of time that two neighboring states
were about to attack us — despite sayeret intercepts that could have given us
time to call up all our reserves. Disentangling the details would take months.
But we already knew the human cost of those failures. Hundreds of Israeli
soldiers had been killed. The final number would be around 2,800, nearly four
times our losses in 1967. Thousands were wounded, some crippled for life.
Many of the dead were men whom I’d grown up with or served with, including
more than 20 in my own battalion. Some of the dead in other units were close
friends.

I felt exhausted. I also realized that Nava, thousands of miles away in Palo
Alto, and my parents on the kibbutz could still not be sure I had escaped the fate
of so many others. I learned later that my parents had been making daily calls to
Digli, who was working in intelligence in the kirya. Though he had no way of
knowing where I was, he kept assuring them that he had checked with my
commanders and that I was alive and well. Nava had been relying on American
news reports and the relayed assurances from my parents, which she was
seasoned enough as an army wife to treat with skepticism.

I missed her badly, and little Michal. I felt the need to hear their voices. I
drove to one of the brigade communications units. There was a long line in front
of the radio telephone. But within a half-hour, I managed to get a crackly
connection to California. Nava burst into tears when she heard my voice. I told
her I was fine, and that I couldn’t wait to see her and our little girl. Then, my
own eyes dampening, I reeled off the names of friends who had died. In
addition to the brave men I’d lost in my own battalion, there were more than a
dozen others I already knew of. A pair of brothers from Mishmar Hasharon, a
couple of years younger than me, in separate units, but killed within hours of
each other. Another childhood friend, from a nearby moshav, named Rafi
Mitzafon. And Shaul Shalev, a gifted philosophy postgraduate and a brave tank
commander whom I’d become friends with at officers’ school. He’d rescued
three dozen troops from one of the Bar-Lev fortifications in the first hours of the
war, only to be killed trying to get to a tank crew who had taken refuge a few

David Woo just sent this — please let me know if you'd like an update on his Washington/market views 
More sign that VAT is making its way into the discussion.... 
As you all know, I have been arguing that VAT make tremendous economic sense 
A VAT has all the virtues of a BAT without any of its drawbacks 
The fact that this is being discussed makes me think that we are getting to a more serious stage of the negotiation over 
tax reform 
This news is bullish for Trump trades, at least for the medium-term 
White House explores two new tax ideas — a value-added tax and carbon tax — as leading proposal to raise revenue 
falters 
Washington Post 
April 4 
By Damian Paletta and Max Ehrenfreund 
President Trump's administration is exploring the creation of two controversial new taxes — a value-added tax and a 
carbon tax — as part of a broad overhaul of the tax code, according to an administration official and one other person 
briefed on the process. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 014857 
The value-added tax, which is popular in many other countries, would serve as a kind of national sales tax, one that 
consumers would pay when they make purchases and that businesses would pay for supplies, services and raw 
materials. A carbon tax would target the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouses gases in the burning of 
gasoline, coal and other fossil fuels. 
The study of the new options — which would represent major changes to American economic policy — comes as the 
administration looks to tax reform as its next major battleground for implementing its agenda. Trump wants to cut 
taxes sharply, but his advisers are looking for ways to raise revenue so as not to create a giant hole in the deficit. 
Administration officials stressed that no final decision has been made and they are reviewing different alternatives. 
Two officials and a third person confirmed the consideration of the value-added tax, while one official and the third 
person confirmed the consideration of the carbon tax. 
The search for new options reflects a recognition of the political challenges facing a proposal known as a border-
adjustment tax that the White House and some Republicans had begun to rally around. The proposal, effectively a tax 
on imports, would not only raise needed revenue but also serve to fulfill Trump's pledge to protect American 
companies from unfair export competition. 
The tax would create incentives for companies to manufacture and produce goods domestically. But the proposal is 
unpopular with many other Republicans, who have said it would raise costs for consumers on things such as 
automobiles, electronics and clothing. 
A value-added tax and a carbon tax have long been favored tools among economists, including some on the right, to 
raise revenue in a way that supports economic growth. But the prospect of any new taxes has long drawn skepticism 
from Republicans.

hours of anticipated partying and sightseeing? The most plausible explanation for the removal
and non-replacement of the panty liner was that it was done in anticipation of consensual sex.

Moreover, if she did not want to have sex, she could easily have locked herself in the bathroom
and called for help from the bathroom phone. The bathroom had a working lock and a phone.
Instead, she willingly came out of the bathroom, passed a door leading to the outside corridor and
went back to Tyson's bedroom, where they had sex on the bed.

According to Washington's own testimony, Tyson asked her, during their sexual encounter,
whether she wanted to get on top and she responded yeah,” and proceeded to get on top—not
the usual position for a rape victim!

Mike Tyson had every reason to believe that Desiree was just another groupie looking for sex
with a celebrity athlete. The rules of groupie sex are well known to both groupies and athletes.
The groupies want sex with superstars in exchange for bragging rights that they slept with the
high-scorer, the champ or the star. Some, like Washington, hope that the star will fall for
her and make her rich and famous. Indeed, several other contestants - - friends of Desiree - -
testified that after meeting Mike Tyson, Desiree bragged to her friend that she was going out with
him because this is Mike Tyson. He's got a lot of money. He's dumb. You see what Robin
Givens got out of him. She told another friend that Robin Givens had him. I can have him too
... He's dumb anyway. To her roommate, she said: Mike doesn't have to know how to speak
well. He'll make all the money and I'll do the talking.

Tyson testified that he was blunt, direct and unambiguous about what he wanted from
Washington. When he asked her out—in front of a witness—she suggested a movie or dinner. But
he said no: That's not what I [have] in mind... I want you. I want to fuck you. The
witness—Johnny Gill, a singer—testified that Tyson said, I want to fuck. Gill later asked Tyson
how he could be so straightforward with women, and Tyson explained that he is used to saying
what is on his mind.

Desiree Washington knew full well that Mike wanted to have sex with her when she went to his
hotel room after two o'clock in the morning. Yet she testified that she had no idea that Tyson had
any interest in having sex. How any rational person could believe that, especially in light of what
is now known about Washington, is mind-boggling. She may have been disappointed and hurt
when he treated her like a groupie—a one-night stand—rather than as a continuing romantic
interest. She realized that she could not exploit his sexual interest in her the way Robin Givens
had done, and she was afraid of the reaction of her friends and family when it became known that
she had indulged in a one-night stand with Tyson. A friend of hers told the press that Desiree
only cried rape after her furious father found out she'd had sex with Tyson.

Our investigation revealed that she had had previously engaged in consensual sex with an
athlete—the high school football hero—and when her father found out about it and threatened to
beat her, she lied to her father and told him she had been raped, thus falsely accusing the football
player.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014060.txt,"2014] CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS 81

For purposes of this Article, it is appropriate to focus on the last two of
these three rights: the right to confer and the nght to fair treatment. The
first of these three rights—the right to be reasonably protected—is already
clearly extended by another statute to crime victims before the filing of
charges. While OLC does not acknowledge this fact, the VRRA extends
the first right to crime victims, directing that a “responsible official shall
arrange for a victim to receive reasonable protection from a suspected
offender and persons acting in concert with or at the behest of the suspected
offender.”'*! Because a “suspected” offender obviously exists before the
filing of criminal charges, the VRRA envisions the right to protection being
provided as soon as is practical after a victim suffers from the commission
of a crime. Additionally, the sections of the Attorney General Guidelines
for Victim and Witness Assistance addressing the VRRA direct that Justice
Department components must provide reasonable protection even before the
filing of criminal charges.'*? So, under the VRRA, the Justice Department
should already be providing reasonable protection for a victim before an
offender is indicted, regardless of how the CVRA is interpreted!”

The VRRA, however, does not contain a right to confer and a right to
fair treatment and respect for the victim’s dignity. Therefore, if victims are
going to receive these statutory rights before trial, these rights must be
found in the CVRA. With regard to the CVRA provision that victims have
the “reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in the
case,”!*+ OLC contends that “[t]he phrase ‘in the case’ implies the pendency
of a judicial proceeding.”'*? To bolster its conclusion, OLC then cites
Black’s Law Dictionary, which includes among its several definitions of the
word “case” the definition “a civil or criminal proceeding.”'*° But OLC
does not acknowledge that Black’s Law Dictionary also defines and
exemplifies a “case” more broadly as a “criminal investigation <the

notification of rights before charges are filed). For purposes of this Article, it is not
necessary to explore this right in detail. If other CVRA rights apply before charges are filed,
a fortiori this right does as well. If a victim has a right, presumably the victim should be
notified of the existence of that right.

121 42 U.S.C. § 10607(c)(2) (2006) (emphasis added).

122 See ATTORNEY GENERAL GUIDELINES, supra note 52, at 7-8, 26-28.

123 Exactly what “reasonable protection” means, however, remains uncertain. See
generally Mary Margaret Giannini, Redeeming an Empty Promise: Procedural Justice, the
Crime Victims’ Rights Act, and the Victim’s Right to Be Reasonably Protected from the
Accused, 78 TENN. L. REV. 47 (2010) (suggesting the right has not been adequately defined
and proposing ways to do so).

14 18 U.S.C. § 3771(aN(5).

125 OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 8.

126 Td. (citing BLACK’s LAW DICTIONARY, supra note 59, at 243).

vious meetings with Bamford. So I sent Kucherena, via Zamir, ten
questions that I wanted to ask Snowden.

I next obtained a multi-entry Russian visa from the Russian con-
sulate in New York and booked myself a room in the Hotel National.

My night flight from New York to Moscow took just less than
eight hours and landed at Terminal D of Sheremetyevo Interna-
tional Airport at 7:40 a.m. on October 29, 2015. I did not immedi-
ately proceed through passport control, in part because I wanted to
explore the transit zone in which Snowden was supposedly trapped
for six weeks.

Sheremetyevo Two, where all international flights land, was built
in the waning days of the Cold War for international passengers
arriving for the Moscow 1980 Summer Olympics. It was modern-
ized in 2010, including opening a walkway that connects Terminals
D, E, and F for transit passengers.

Snowden had vanished, at least from public view, in this com-
plex of terminals for nearly six weeks in the summer of 2013. His
explanation to journalists, as will be recalled, was two part. First, he

© said he had planned to board the next fight to Cuba and from there ©
proceed to Ecuador. He said that he was unable to board this flight
because his passport had been invalidated by the U.S. government
while he was flying to Russia. Second, after discovering his passport
had been revoked, he stayed in a capsule hotel in the transit zone for
the next thirty-nine days. To better understand the plausibility of
his version of those events, I proceeded through the transit passage
to Terminal F, where Snowden’s plane from Hong Kong had landed
at 5:15 p.m. Moscow time on June 23, 2013.

Snowden did not go through passport control upon arrival.
Before any of the other passengers were allowed to disembark from
the plane, Russian plainclothes officers from the special services
boarded the plane and asked both Snowden and Sarah Harrison, his
WikiLeaks-supplied “ninja,” to accompany them to a waiting car
that whisked them away. According to the account in Izvestia, “A
special operation was conducted for his reception and evacuation.” It
further said, “Snowden’s flight to Moscow was coordinated with the
Russian authorities and intelligence services.”

If not for the “special operation,” he could have easily gone by foot

creation can be useful indirectly in calculating these probability estimates, via providing
new concepts that can be used to make useful inference trails more compact and hence
easier to construct.

— Example: The dog may reason that because Jack likes to play, and Jack and Jill are both
children, maybe Jill likes to play too. It can carry out this reasoning only if its concept
creation process has invented the concept of “child” via analysis of observed data.

In these examples we have focused on cases where two terms in the cognitive schematic are
fixed and the third must be filled in; but just as often, the situation is that only one of the
terms is fixed. For instance, if we fix G, sometimes the best approach will be to collectively
learn C' and P. This requires either a procedure learning method that works interactively with a
declarative-knowledge-focused concept learning or reasoning method; or a declarative learning
method that works interactively with a procedure learning method. That is, it requires the sort
of cognitive synergy built into the CogPrime design.

8.6 Cognitive Synergy for Procedural and Declarative Learning

We now present a little more algorithmic detail regarding the operation and synergetic in-
teraction of CogPrime’s two most sophisticated components: the MOSES procedure learning
algorithm (see Chapter 33), and the PLN uncertain inference framework (see Chapter 34). The
treatment is necessarily quite compact, since we have not yet reviewed the details of either
MOSES or PLN; but as well as illustrating the notion of cognitive synergy more concretely,
perhaps the high-level discussion here will make clearer how MOSES and PLN fit into the big
picture of CogPrime.

8.6.1 Cognitive Synergy in MOSES

MOSES, CogPrime’s primary algorithm for learning procedural knowledge, has been tested on
a variety of application problems including standard GP test problems, virtual agent control,
biological data analysis and text classification [Loo06]. It represents procedures internally as
program trees. Each node in a MOSES program tree is supplied with a “knob,” comprising a
set of values that may potentially be chosen to replace the data item or operator at that node.
So for instance a node containing the number 7 may be supplied with a knob that can take
on any integer value. A node containing a while loop may be supplied with a knob that can
take on various possible control flow operators including conditionals or the identity. A node
containing a procedure representing a particular robot movement, may be supplied with a knob
that can take on values corresponding to multiple possible movements. Following a metaphor
suggested by Douglas Hofstadter [Hof96], MOSES learning covers both “knob twiddling” (setting
the values of knobs) and “knob creation.”

MOSES is invoked within CogPrime in a number of ways, but most commonly for finding a
procedure P satisfying a probabilistic implication C& P - G as described above, where C is an
observed context and G is a system goal. In this case the probability value of the implication
provides the “scoring function” that MOSES uses to assess the quality of candidate procedures.

Case No. . . . : 1-05-000368 (Continued)

During a sworn taped statement, Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed
by Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six months. He was referred by
associates and his employment lasted the months of November 2004
through May 2005. His responsibilities as house manager included
being the butler, chauffer, chef, houseman, run errands for Mr.
Epstein and provide for Epstein's guests. Rodriguez advised he had
very limited contact with Mr. Epstein. If Rodriguez needed to relay a
message to Mr. Epstein, he would have to notify Epstein's secretary
Leslie in New York City, who would then notify Epstein's personal
assistant, [BBB who would relay the message to Epstein. Rodriguez
stated Epstein did not want to see or hear the staff when he was in
residence.

I asked Rodriguez if Epstein received many guests during his stay in
Palm Beach. Rodriguez advised he had many guests. I asked
specifically about masseuses coming to the house. Rodriguez stated he
would have two massages a day. Epstein would have one massage in the
morning and one massage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence.
Rodriguez stated he would_be informed to expect someone and make them
comfortable until either or Epstein would meet with them.

Rodriguez stated once the masseuses would arrive, he would allow them

entry into the kitchen area and offer them something to drink or eat.

They would then be encountered by either MJ or Epstein. They

would be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if

any of the masseuses appeared young in age. He advised he didn't ask

their ages but felt they were very young. Rodriguez stated they ate

like his own daughter who is in high school. Rodriguez stated they

would eat tons of cereal and drink milk all the time.. Rodriguez

stated the girls that would come appeared to be too young to be

masseuses. He stated one time under Epstein's direction, he delivered

a dozen roses top TT for one of the girls b6

that came to provide a massage. He knew the girls were still in high bic

school and were of high school age. I asked Rodriguez about the
_Massages. He felt there was a lot more going on than just massages.

He would clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the alleged massages and

would discover massager/vibrators and sex toys scattered on the floor.

He also said he would wipe down the vibrators and sex toys and put

them away in an armoire. He described the armoire as a small wood

armoire which was on the wall close to Epstein's bed.

Epstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollar rent a car and rent a
car for the same girl he brought the roses to, so that she could drive
her self to Epstein's house without incident. Rodriguez said the girl
always needed rides to and from the house. Rodriguez referred himself
as a human ATM machine and was ordered by Epstein to maintain a
minimum balance of $2,000 dollars on him at all times. When a girl
would come by the house and Mr. Epstein was either not in residence or
was not at home at the time, Rodriguez was to provide the girl
(masseuse) several hundred dollars for their time and to notify
Epstein the amount they were given. Epstein also ordered Rodriguez to

There was a lot of legal discussion about Andy and his ex-wife (“Fergie”). Then the discussion
turned to me. Maxwell said “guess how old she is.” Prince Andrew guessed 17.

35. Then we all went to a Chinese restaurant for dinner and then to Club Tramp, a
fancy “members only” night club in central London. Andy arranged for alcohol to be provided
to me at the club. Eventually we left. I rode with Epstein and Maxwell back to the townhouse.
On the way there, Epstein and Maxwell informed me that the Prince wanted to see “more of me”
that night. Andy traveled in a separate car with his guards.

36. We all arrived back at the townhome and went upstairs. Epstein took a picture of
me and Andy with my own camera. The picture above is that picture, which has been widely
circulated on the internet. Andy has his left arm around my waist and is smiling. The picture was
developed on March 13, 2001, and was taken sometime shortly before I had it developed. I was
17 years old at the time.

37. I wanted a picture with the prince because I was keeping in contact with my
family. I had told my mom and my grandma that I was meeting Prince Andrew and that I'd take
a picture for them. They told me to “be careful.”

38. After the picture, Epstein and Maxwell kissed me and said to “have fun.” They
left Andy and me alone upstairs. We went to the bathroom and bedroom, which were just steps
away from where the picture was taken. We engaged in sexual activities there. Afterwards,
Andy left quickly with his security.

39, I chatted with Epstein about this the next day. I told him, “it went great.” Epstein
said something to the effect of, “You did well. The Prince had fun.” I felt like I was being

graded. It was horrible to have to recount all these events and have to try to meet all these needs

irrelevance otherwise.

A Democrat-leaning candidate would have to top the ideal third-party ticket. We need someone
with a shot at snaking a plurality of the vote in the blue states Hillary Clinton won (227 electoral
votes), but moderate enough to win a plurality in some combination of Trump states like Florida,
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan (another 119 votes). The right candidate may even to put
North Carolina, Ohio, Indiana in play for a centrist bi-partisan ticket as well (totaling an electoral
sweep of 464 elector votes). A right leaning candidate would meet the same fate as a primary
challenger to Trump — for all intents and purposes we need to assume that 36% of voters won’t be
cleaved from Trump under any circumstances and run to win around them. The deep red states

would be off the table entirely.

With the Trump reality show airing daily, voters are now expecting to take their politics with a side
of entertainment. Heretofore, ratings will matter no matter how dry the policy topic. Surely
Stephen Colbert would gladly sacrifice his executive producer Chris Licht to produce a daily
comedic segment of this dream candidate interviewing Americans in truck stops and McDonald’s
across the country. A few of the “Saturday Night Live” script writers could certainly be enticed to
disguise serious debates as informative amusement. Any candidate must be committed to a near
daily cadence of high quality, compelling video production. It will be especially crucial to keep
the voters’ attention during what will be a raucous Democratic primary season. Rules governing
access to the general election debate stage dictate that a candidate enjoy support of at least 15% of

voters in the months leading up to the general election.

This dream candidate would pledge to serve only four years and address all of the U.S.’s ticking
time bombs like Social Security, Medicare, health care reform, climate change, money in politics,
gerrymandering, and infrastructure investment in a single term. This one-and-done term decouples
our candidate from the usual politics and gives them the power of promise and deliver decisive
action. A four-year term pledge ensures governance independent of campaign finance concerns and

narrow special interests inherent to winning re-election. This “fix-it” ticket would promise to force

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016986.txt,"When we consider the future of AI, we need to think about the goals. That’s what
humans contribute; that’s what our civilization contributes. The execution of those goals
is what we can increasingly automate. What will the future of humans be in such a
world? What will there be for them to do? One of my projects has been to understand
the evolution of human purposes over time. Today we’ve got all kinds of purposes. If
you look back a thousand years, people’s goals were quite different: How do I get my
food? How do I keep myself safe? In the modern Western world, for the most part you
don’t spend a large fraction of your life thinking about those purposes. From the point of
view of a thousand years ago, some of the goals people have today would seem utterly
bizarre—for example, like exercising on a treadmill. A thousand years ago that would
sound like a crazy thing to do.

What will people be doing in the future? A lot of purposes we have today are
generated by scarcity of one kind or another. There are scarce resources in the world.
People want to get more of something. Time itself is scarce in our lives. Eventually,
those forms of scarcity will disappear. The most dramatic discontinuity will surely be
when we achieve effective human immortality. Whether this will be achieved
biologically or digitally isn’t clear, but inevitably it will be achieved. Many of our
current goals are driven in part by our mortality: “I’m only going to live a certain time, so
I'd better get this or that done.” And what happens when most of our goals are executed
automatically? We won’t have the kinds of motivations we have today. One question I’d
like an answer for is, What do the derivatives of humans in the future end up choosing to
do with themselves? One of the potential bad outcomes is that they just play video games
all the time.

The term “artificial intelligence” is evolving, in its use in technical language. These
days, AI is very popular, and people have some idea of what it means. Back when
computers were being developed, in the 1940s and 1950s, the typical title of a book or a
magazine article about computers was “Giant Electronic Brains.” The idea was that just
as bulldozers and steam engines and so on automated mechanical work, computers would
automate intellectual work. That promise turned out to be harder to fulfill than many
people expected. There was, at first, a great deal of optimism; a lot of government
money got spent on such efforts in the early 1960s. They basically just didn’t work.

There are a lot of amusing science-fiction-ish portrayals of computers in the
movies of that time. There’s a cute one called Desk Set, which is about an IBM-type
computer being installed in a broadcasting company and putting everybody out of a job.
It’s cute because the computer gets asked a bunch of reference-library questions. When
my colleagues and I were building Wolfram|Alpha, one of the ideas we had was to get it
to answer all of those reference-library questions from Desk Set. By 2009, it could
answer them all.

In 1943, Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts came up with a model for how
brains conceptually, formally, might work—an artificial neural network. They saw that
their brainlike model would do computations in the same way as Turing Machines. From
their work, it emerged that we could make brainlike neural networks that would act as
general computers. And in fact, the practical work done by the ENIAC folks and John

support is also building up for creating havens for Syrian refugees in
Turkey, Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan.

Moscow had also expressed concern that, with Assad’s demise, a new
Syrian government might “ignore Russia’s interests in the Middle
East.” Since the vetoes, however, the Syrian National Council has
established contact with Russia and China to offer assurances that a
democratic Syria would pursue “cooperation with all nations.”

SNC sources tell me that they’ve also “opened a dialogue” with Iran,
Assad’s main supporter, amid signs that it, too, may no longer be so
sure about the despot’s chances of survival.

America must take the lead in mobilizing international support for the
Syrian revolution. By removing one of the last regimes that still
sponsors terrorism, the victory of democracy in Syria is in America’s
best national interests.

Moreover, the fervor in the hatred of Israel could not be explained in rational, policy terms.
Israel, the “Jew Among Nations,” was being treated by many on the hard left and on the Islamic
right, in the way the Jewish people had been treated for millennia. This change took me by
surprise.

In the conclusion to my 1991 book, Chutzpah, I predicted the end of mainstream, top-down anti-
Semitism in America, and its replacement by anti-Zionism. I also predicted “a sharp decline in
support for Israel among college and university students,” who will be “tomorrow’s leaders.” I
should have, but did not anticipate that the new anti-Zionism would morph into anti-Semitism, at
least for some. I should have because the hatred of Israel by the hard left and the Islamic right
was So irrational, so off the charts, so extreme, that it could be explained only by a hatred for
Israel’s Jewishness. A confrontation I experienced in 2004 was all too typical:

It took place in front of Faneuil Hall, the birthplace of American independence and liberty. I was
receiving a justice award and delivering a talk from the podium of that historic hall on civil
liberties in the age of terrorism. When I left, award in hand, I was accosted by a group of
screaming, angry young men and women carrying virulently anti-Israel signs. The sign carriers
were shouting epithets at me that crossed the line from civility to bigotry. “Dershowitz and Hitler,
just the same, the only difference is the name.” The sin that, in the opinion of the screamers,
watranted this comparison between me and the man who murdered dozens of my family members
was my support for Israel.

It was irrelevant to these chanters that I also support a Palestinian state, the end of the Israeli
occupation, and the dismantling of most of the settlements. The protestors also shouted,
“Dershowitz and Gibbels [sic], just the same, the only difference is the name”—not even knowing
how to pronounce the name of the anti-Semitic Nazi butcher.

One sign carrier shouted that Jews who support Israel are worse than Nazis. Another demanded
that I be tortured and killed. It was not only their words; it was the hatred in their eyes. If a dozen
Boston police had not been protecting me, I have little doubt I would have been physically
attacked. The protestors’ eyes were ablaze with fanatical zeal.

The feminist writer Phyllis Chesler aptly describes the hatred some young people often direct
against Israel and supporters of the Jewish state as “eroticized.” That is what I saw: passionate
hatred, ecstatic hatred, orgasmic hatred. It was beyond mere differences of opinion.

When I looked into their faces, I could imagine young Nazis in the 1930s in Hitler’s Germany.
They had no doubt that they were right and that I was pure evil for my support of the Jewish
state, despite my public disagreement with some of Israel’s policies and despite my support for
Palestinian statehood.

There was no place for nuance here. It was black and white, good versus evil, and any Jew who
supported Israel was pure evil, deserving of torture, violence, and whatever fate Hitler and
Goebbels deserved.

To be sure, these protestors’ verbal attack on me was constitutionally protected speech, just as
the Nazi march through Skokie was constitutionally protected speech. But the shouting was
plainly calculated to intimidate. An aura of violence was in the air, and had the police not been
there, I would not have been able to express any views counter to theirs.

A pedophile ring is beyond my scope of understanding, and about one of the worst things that could ever be
considered acceptable. It is an extremely important issue, and I sure don’t want it to escape full coverage by the
media.

Virginia says: ‘Ghislaine said | was to start immediately and that someone would drive me home.

My father left and | was told to go upstairs.’ She was led by another woman through Epstein’s bedroom
into a massage room where he lay face down naked on a table.

He started to interviewed Virginia. This was unconventional, but Virginia had no suspicions. Presumably,
she thought, this was how the wealthy conducted their business.

Epstein elicited the information that Virginia had been a runaway, and was no longer a virgin.

Virginia was then told to start massaging Epstein, under the instructions of the woman who had shown
her in. The massage quickly developed into a sexual encounter.

Virginia was uncomfortable, but reluctant to deny such important people. ‘My face was red with
embarrassment,’ she says. ‘But | felt under immense pressure to please them.

The whole time it was going on, they were promising me the world, that I'd travel with Jeffrey on his
private jet and have a well-paid profession.’ Afterwards, she was given two $100 bills and told to return
the next day.

That was the beginning of the four years she spent with Epstein.

For three of those years, she was under Florida’s age of consent, which is 18.

Troubled teenager: Virginia on the billionaire's Zorro ranch in New Mexico in 2001

Virginia was fascinated by his life story: the son of a humble New York City parks worker, he was a
teacher before becoming a Wall Street broker and friends with the upper echelons of the political,
financial and academic establishment.

As a confused teenager, Virginia easily fell into the practice of sexually gratifying him for money.

Q. So is it accurate that after you filed what's
Exhibit 2, that the dean of the law school asked you to
file a corrected version with the footnote?

A. No. That misunderstands what I said. Early
on, just in talking -- I do a lot pro bono litigation
for crime victims all over the country, and I do that,
that's one of the reasons I'm at the University of Utah.
They have been very supportive of my pro bono work in
this case as well as in other cases, and so the dean
said, well, one of the things just might be helpful is
to drop a footnote. I don't think it was required that
I drop the footnote, nobody suggested it would be useful
to drop the footnote, and so I agreed to do that in this
case and in other cases as well, but somehow in this
particular pleading, the -- as I say, the signature
block possibly was a cut-and-paste from an earlier
pleading in the case, possibly it was some issue
involving that section feature of the word processing
program. The star footnote had dropped off.

And so once I realized that without anyone
calling that to my attention when I looked at the brief
a couple of days after we filed it, and said, oh, I need
to fix that and did, indeed, fix that as quickly as I
could.

— Ex-Morgan Stanley executive Greg Fleming to be firm’s CEO

— Hedge fund to become majority owner of high-net-worth adviser

Greg Fleming, a former top executive at Morgan Stanley, is joining with the Rockefeller family office to create a wealth-management firm that
will be backed by Viking Global Investors.

Fleming will be chief executive officer of Rockefeller Capital Management, an adviser to the ultra-wealthy that will be acquired by Viking

Global after the deal is completed early next year, the New York-based company said Wednesday inastatement _. Terms weren’t disclosed.

Fleming, 54, who was most recently president of Morgan Stanley Wealth and Asset Management, left the Wall Street firm last year after CEO
James Gorman indicated he planned to stay on at least five more years and installed an older deputy in the bank’s No. 2 position, people with
knowledge of the decision said at the time. Before joining Morgan Stanley, Fleming was president of Merrill Lynch & Co.

C) Replay

In addition to wealth and asset management, the new company will create a unit focusing on advising large multinational companies, Fleming
said in a phone interview.

‘Strategic Advice’

“Many wealthy families own companies that they need to take public or sell,” he said. “They’re looking for strategic advice, and they’re looking
for interesting investments.”

Chinese defense universities explicitly tasked with acquiring foreign technology; others are
not and targeted for access to research they have pursued by their own passion and intellect.
Indeed, some nontraditional collectors may even be unwitting in their support.

Collectors do not appear to be chosen by Beijing for their race or nationality; rather they
are targeted for their access to the desired intellectual property and their willingness to
violate their employee agreements or national laws. Indeed, more recent scholarship has
shattered the shibboleth that the Chinese government only recruits ethnic Chinese. While
Chinese intelligence does have a historically strong track record of attempting to recruit
ethnic Chinese, primarily because of cultural and language affinity, more recent cases of
espionage and technology transfer suggest that the Chinese government has broadened its
tradecraft to recruit nonethnic Chinese assets and collectors as well, perhaps as a way of
complicating US counterintelligence efforts.

China’s most systematic channel for identifying foreign-based nontraditional collectors is
its Recruitment Program of Global Experts (2S BRATS|HItz), commonly known as

the Thousand Talents Plan (FAit&I) or the Thousand Talents Program (TTP).° The TTP is a
massive and sustained talent recruitment campaign designed to recruit leading experts from
overseas to assist in the country’s modernization drive.

Initiated in 2008, the TTP aims to recruit leading overseas scientists and experts who work
in areas that are deemed high priority for achieving China’s modernization goals.° The
program originally aimed to recruit 1,000 “overseas talents” (#3\A4) over a period of five
to ten years. Official Chinese TTP websites list more than three hundred US government
researchers and more than six hundred US corporate personnel who have accepted TTP
money.’ In many cases, these individuals do not disclose receiving the TTP money to their
employer, which for US government employees is illegal and for corporate personnel likely
represents a conflict of interest that violates their employee agreement.

State Collection Apparatus

China’s nontraditional collection relies on a web of activities, including open-source research,
exchanges, cooperation and professional organizations, direct funding of research, strategic
acquisition, or cyberespionage.

Open-source

China’s efforts to exploit foreign innovation is further seen in its open-source acquisition
infrastructure, which surpasses that of any other country. China employs a cadre of
thousands to locate, study, and disseminate foreign journals, patents, proceedings,
dissertations, and technical standards without regard to ownership or copyright restrictions.
The documents are indexed, archived, and supplied to Chinese commercial and military
“customers.”

“He disputes that he ever had sex with any under-age person or anything like
that,” said Mr. Lefcourt, whose clients have included Russell Crowe, Martha Stewart
and Abbie Hoffman.

Neither the police nor the state attorney’s office would discuss the case in detail.
But the police released a thick report on the 13-month investigation after the
indictment was unsealed in late July.

The police started investigating Mr. Epstein in March 2005, almost immediately
after they were contacted by the stepmother of the 14-year-old, who, according to the
report, was in a special school for students with disciplinary problems.

The girl, the report said, told the police that an older friend had “offered her an
opportunity to make money” and had driven her to Mr. Epstein’s house one Sunday.
The friend, identified by the police as Haley Robson, a local community college
student, told the girl to say she was 18 if Mr. Epstein asked, the report said.

The girl told the police that Mr. Epstein’s assistant had led her upstairs to a
room with a massage table and that Mr. Epstein had come in and told her to remove
her clothes. She said Mr. Epstein had masturbated as she massaged him, had
pressed a vibrator against her underwear and had given her $300 afterward.

In October, the police interviewed Ms. Robson, then 19, who told them Mr.
Epstein had routinely paid her to bring teenage girls to his home. The police then
interviewed a total of 5 alleged victims and 17 witnesses, many of whom told similar
stories about what they had observed or participated in at Mr. Epstein’s home.
According to the report, at least one said Mr. Epstein had engaged in intercourse
with her.

Mr. Lefcourt, his lawyer, said one girl who told the police of having had sex with
Mr. Epstein as a minor had lied about both the sex and her age and had not shown
up for grand jury questioning. He also said Mr. Epstein had passed a lie-detector test
clearing him of any sexual involvement with under-age girls.

A spokeswoman for the Palm Beach police said that early this year, the police
went to Mr. Krischer, the state attorney, intending to apply for warrants to arrest

During the campaign, President-elect Trump argued
vigorously against the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership
(TPP), vowed to renegotiate the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and pledged to label China as
a currency manipulator, which could trigger the
imposition of significant tariffs on Chinese imports.

Senate Finance Committee. President-elect Trump may
find himself somewhat at odds on his trade agenda with
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Hatch who has
supported numeroustrade agreements during his
congressional tenure.

House Ways and Means Committee. House Republican
trade leaders —including Speaker Ryan and Ways and
Means Chairman Brady —played a pivotal role in
advancing President Obama’s trade initiativesthrough
Congress, including passage of Trade Promotion
Authority (TPA) in 2015. A key question is how closely
they will work to support President-elect Trump’s trade
restrictionist agenda.

Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. Unless TPP can
be approved in the 2016 lame-duck session (an extremely
unlikely prospect, as discussed above), TPP will not be
ratified.

Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership
Agreement. US and EU trade negotiators failed to make
much meaningful progress on TTIPin 2016. Prospects for

Subject: following up: WA poetry release 
Importance: High 
Dear Jeffrey, 
My name is Leah Reis-Dennis, and I'll be heading operations for Lisa's new non-profit, Verse Video Education. 
She's asked me to be in touch with you about helping us get a release from Woody Allen. 
First, I wanted to send along the rough stringout of footage from the conversation with Woody a couple of years 
ago on This is Just to Say by William Carlos Williams. This is totally unedited and uncut footage, but we 
would love the opportunity to turn it into something great. 
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cObnljj xeo0654g/uWZ6KBVbLS?preview=WoodyAllen+Basic+Clip+for+Viewing.mov  
If Woody Allen agrees to let us use the footage, he will be in distinguished company. To date, we have filmed 
conversations about poetry with dozens of distinguished Americans including: 
Bill Clinton 
Al Gore 
John McCain 
Mayor Rahm Emanuel 
Mayor Tom Menino 
Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan 
Sir Mervyn King 
Former Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers 
The conversation would be part of a large multiplatform initiative that Harvard Professor Lisa New has under 
way to bring poetry into the mainstream, and, especially, into English Language Arts classrooms in the United 
States and around the world. The initiative, Poetry in America, includes a HarvardX online course, a television 
series we're creating with WGBH to be paired with PBS LearningMedia segments for the classroom, and, a 
series of online professional development courses we're creating for ELA Middle and High School teachers and 
for their students. 
Let us know if Woody Allen might be open to our sending another release form his way. Of course, if he's 
interested in releasing the footage for only certain parts of our project, we're open to having a conversation 
about that, too. 
Thank you, and I hope to meet you soon.

brought back Moshe Dayan, now a member of the Knesset, as Defense Minister.

I still vividly remember a visitor to the sayeret the day after Eshkol’s
address. Colonel Eli Zeira was head of the “collection department” of the
intelligence corps, the rough equivalent of America’s National Security Agency.
Formally, Sayeret Matkal was part of his department. He called together all the
officers. He said that there had so far been three periods in the Zionist project.
The first was from the early settlements in Palestine at the end of the 19th
century until the establishment of Israel in 1948. The second, from 1948 until
the 1956 War. The third from 1956 until now. Then he said: “There will soon be
a war. Three Arab countries will take part. Within a week, we will defeat all of
them. And a new chapter in the history of Zionism will begin.”

The Six-Day War began on June 5, 1967. As Eli Zeira so confidently
predicted, not just Egypt and Syria, but Jordan, too, joined forces against us.
And it was indeed all over within a week. The final outcome — Israel’s victory —
was sealed by noon on the first day, with wave after wave of pre-emptive
bombing sorties destroying the entire air force of all three Arab countries. But
the fighting which followed was brutal in places: especially around Jerusalem,
but also in the south at the outset of the war, and later on the Golan Heights.

The first effect back in Israel of our air force attacks was to make our sayeret
helicopter missions into the Sinai suddenly superfluous. In fact, it left the entire
unit at loose ends — especially veterans or reservists like me who had been part
of our nearly decade-long development into Israel’s sole, dedicated cross-border
infiltration force. At this point, we were still just an intelligence unit, not an
elite commando force like Britain’s SAS, Avraham Aranan’s ultimate vision for
the sayeret. The aim of our bugging missions into Syria and Egypt was not to
fight. It was to get in and get out, unseen and undetected. But we were not only
equipped to fight if necessary. From the unit’s earliest days under the sway of
Meir Har-Zion, Kapusta and Gibli and Errol and the other grizzled vets from
Unit 101 and Company A, we had been steeped in the spirit of commandos. Our
training was the most rigorous in the Israeli armed forces, involving not just a
punishing endurance régime but learning to assemble and disassemble, fire and
detonate, everything from handguns to machine guns, makeshift explosives to
grenades and landmines.

The frustration we felt on the first morning of the war was not because we
were itching to fight, for the hell of it. One hallmark of the sayeret’s ethos,
especially once the unit did start to evolve into a full-fledged commando unit,

seemingly illogical nominating process to select a candidate? (Why do Iowa and New Hampshire play
such outsized roles? What kind of small-d democratic process relies on superdelegates?) The system
failed in 2016, with both parties producing terribly flawed candidates in a race to the bottom. We need to

build a back-up plan in the event the system fails again.

It's possible, of course, that we won’t need a third-party candidate. Trump could decide not to run for
whatever reason. The Democrats could nominate a winning 2020 candidate. I am not willing to take

those bets.

The ideal candidate for a new third party is someone who is widely perceived to be that rare combination
of both good and great. We are looking for a proven leader of men and women, someone with clear,
democratic — and moral — values that reflect the best of America, not our worst. We know people like this

on the national stage now.

As a thought experiment, consider the possibilities of a ticket outside the partisan lanes and imagine the
chemistry of radical combinations: Biden/Romney? Bill Gates/Hogan? Bloomberg/Haley? Howard

Schultz/Bob Corker? Sandberg/Kasich?

As we have discussed narrow path to electing the first president outside the two major party primary
system in 168 years is more navigable than most think. Heading into 2020, converging trends in
American’s demands for a third party (a historic high of 61%), disapproval of Donald Trump holding
steady above 50%, and the increasingly leftward drift of the Democratic Party suggest that electorate may
be susceptible to merits of a new centrist party. Cynics will say that the structural impediments of ballot
and presidential debate access, the overwhelming advantages of legacy parties’ fundraising and voter
turn-out operations preordain failure, but they’re wrong; the legal and logistical hurdles are amenable to a
combination of lawyering and resources. The bigger, more consequential factors come in terms of
candidate quality and policy. I believe a candidate with five specific characteristics including a unique —

and purposefully non-specific - policy agenda could limbo a win.

"
IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013848.txt,"later than this evening. I don’t recommend using Outlook or computerized to-do lists, because it is
possible to add an infinite number of items. I use a standard piece of paper folded in half three times,
which fits perfectly in the pocket and limits you to noting only a few items.

There should never be more than two mission-critical items to complete each day. Never. It just isn’t
necessary if they’re actually high-impact. If you are stuck trying to decide between multiple items that all
seem crucial, as happens to all of us, look at each in turn and ask yourself, Jf this is the only thing I
accomplish today, will I be satisfied with my day?

To counter the seemingly urgent, ask yourself: What will happen if I don’t do this, and is it worth
putting off the important to do it? If you haven’t already accomplished at least one important task in the
day, don’t spend the last business hour returning a DVD to avoid a $5 late charge. Get the important task
done and pay the $5 fine.

7. Put a Post-it on your computer screen or set an Outlook reminder to alert you at least three
times daily with the question: Are you inventing things to do to avoid the important?

I also use free time-tracking software called RescueTime (www.rescuetime.com) to alert me when I
spend more than an allotted time on certain websites or programs often used to avoid the important
(Gmail, Facebook, Outlook, etc.). It also summarizes your time use each week and compares your
performance to peers.

8. Do not multitask.

I’m going to tell you what you already know. Trying to brush your teeth, talk on the phone, and answer
e-mail at the same time just doesn’t work. Eating while doing online research and instant messaging?
Ditto.

If you prioritize properly, there is no need to multitask. It is a symptom of “task creep” —doing more
to feel productive while actually accomplishing less. As stated, you should have, at most, two primary
goals or tasks per day. Do them separately from start to finish without distraction. Divided attention will
result in more frequent interruptions, lapses in concentration, poorer net results, and less gratification.

9. Use Parkinson’s Law on a Macro and Micro Level.
Use Parkinson’s Law to accomplish more in less time. Shorten schedules and deadlines to necessitate
focused action instead of deliberation and procrastination.

On a weekly and daily macro level, attempt to take Monday and/or Friday off, as well as leave work at
4PM. This will focus you to prioritize more effectively and quite possibly develop a social life. If you’re
under the hawklike watch of a boss, we’ll discuss the nuts and bolts of how to escape in later chapters.

On a micro task level, limit the number of items on your to-do list and use impossibly short deadlines
to force immediate action while ignoring minutiae.

If doing work online or near an online computer, http://e.ggtimer.com/ is a convenient countdown
timer. Just type the desired time limit directly into the URL field and hit enter. The http:// can often be

bifurcation scenarios in nonlinear dynamical systems where bifurcation means
discontinuous changes in patterns of behavior (dependent variables) resulting from
smooth changes in parameters (independent variables). Alerted to their presence in
computer experiments with biologically relevant nonlinear differential equations,
these phenomena have since been found in time series from patch clamped
membrane channels, single neurons, neuronal networks, neuroendocrine systems,
brain waves and patterns of behavior in animals and man (see below). Cartwright-
Littlewood found that the inner and outer edges of the domains of attraction (all the
initial values that eventually wind up in the attractor—the limit set of all bounded
solutions) of two different sets of subharmonic periods for the same parameter
settings were interlaced at many scales in what is today called a fractal basin
boundary. It was in this way that the specific values of the end state are understood
to be indeterminate since the starting values in the fractal basin boundary are

impossible to isolate and specify with adequate experimental precision.

Similar biologically-relevant analog computer discoveries about the Van der
Pol and comparable periodically forced, dissipative (energy utilizing) Duffing
equations (Zeeman, 1976) were made in the early 1960’s by electrical engineer,
Yoshi Ueda (1992), but his thesis director, Chihiro Hayashi of Japan’s Kyoto
University, was sufficiently disturbed by this evidence for the existence of bounded
solutions (attractors) that were neither fixed points (equilibria) nor periodic orbits
(cycles), the only ones known at the time and therefore “strange,” that he refused to
let Ueda publish his findings until he did so as an independent investigator in the
1970's.

In the early 1960’s, Edward Lorenz (1963), a meteorologist and student of
the Harvard mathematician and dynamical systems pioneer, George Birkoff (1922),
was computing the output of a very reduced subset of Saltzman’s differential
equations for predicting the weather (1962). Lorenz found that numerically
integrated trajectories manifested unpredictable times and directions of motion
between the two spiral orbits of what has come to be known as the Lorenz attractor.

Very small differences in starting values led to widely diverse final values, and, just

the number zero behaves just like any other counting number. It also
works with multiplication. If I have zero lots of 4 cakes, I have no cakes.
Zero times four is zero, so multiplication with zero works. There is one
embarrassing exception, if I divide by zero I seem to get infinity. When I
was a child this was a definition for infinity, but nowadays mathematicians
simply forbid the operation. Division by zero is not allowed and if you
try it on your computer, you will get the not terribly useful, #DIV/0!
Error. That’s progress I guess!

Zero had been tamed. What about infinity?

Cantor showed that while you could think of infinity as a number,
it might not be just one number. He proposed there are many infinities.
In fact, there are a greater than infinite number of them! He did this
through a rigorous analysis of a new branch of mathematics called set
theory.

Set theory is now the cornerstone of modern mathematics, but it
was treated with suspicion in Cantor's time. Rather than embrace the new
thinking, many mathematicians ridiculed it; Poincaré wrote that Cantor’s
ideas were a grave disease infecting the discipline of mathematics! This
seems odd given our modern propensity to embrace innovation, but the
tone of science back then was different: innovation was not necessarily
considered a good thing.

At the turn of the 20 century, scientists were on a mission to tidy
things up. Lord Kelvin announced in 1890 that mankind had discovered
everything there was to know and the role of future scientists was simply
to catalogue and observe the consequences of these laws, and to improve
the accuracy of measurement. The last thing scientists wanted was a
completely new set of numbers that behaved in strange ways. Cantor was
upsetting the apple cart, but he was in good company. Just a few miles
away in Berlin, a young Albert Einstein was beginning to study physics
in his spare time. Those studies would culminate in his four papers of
1905, two on Quantum Mechanics and two on Relativity, ushering in the
modern age of physics.

How to Count

To understand infinity you need to count in a particular way. You’re
probably used to counting with numbers. You count apples: one, two,
three, and say, “I have three apples.” You can do the same with oranges.
If you have three apples and three oranges, the totals are the same and
you can declare you have the same number of fruits. This is the first way
to count.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020048.txt,"which point, at Kushner’s direction, the initial explanation of Comey’s firing became that
the president had acted solely on their recommendation. Spicer was forced to deliver this
unlikely rationale, as was the vice president. But this pretense unraveled almost
immediately, not least because most everyone in the West Wing, wanting nothing to do
with the decision to fire Comey, was helping to unravel tt.

The president, along with his family, stood on one side of the White House divide,
while the staff—mouths agape, disbelieving and speechless—stood on the other.

But the president seemed also to want it known that he, aroused and dangerous,
personally took down Comey. Forget Rosenstein and Sessions, it was personal. It was a
powerful president and a vengeful one, in every way galled and affronted by those in
pursuit of him, and determined to protect his family, who were in turn determined to have
him protect them.

“The daughter will take down the father,” said Bannon, in a Shakespearian mood.

Within the West Wing there was much replaying of alternative scenarios. If you wanted
to get rid of Comey, there were surely politic ways of doing it—which had in fact been
suggested to Trump. (A curious one—an idea that later would seem ironic—was to get rid
of General Kelly at Homeland Security and move Comey into that job.) But the point
really was that Trump had wanted to confront and humiliate the FBI director. Cruelty was
a Trump attribute.

The firing had been carried out publicly and in front of his family—catching Comey
entirely off guard as he gave a speech in California. Then the president had further
personalized the blow with an ad hominem attack on the director, suggesting that the FBI
itself was on Trump’s side and that it, too, had only contempt for Comey.

The next day, as though to further emphasize and delight in both the insult and his
personal impunity, the president met with Russian bigwigs in the Oval Office, including
Russia’s Ambassador Kislyak, the very focus of much of the Trump-Russia investigation.
To the Russians he said: “I just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy, a real nut job. I
faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off.” Then, to boot, he revealed
information supplied to the United States by Israel from its agent in place in Syria about
ISIS using laptops to smuggle bombs onto airlines—revealing enough information to
compromise the Israeli agent. (This incident did not help Trump’s reputation in
intelligence circles, since, in spycraft, human sources are to be protected above all other
secrets.)

“It’s Trump,” said Bannon. “He thinks he can fire the FBI.”

OOK Ok

Trump believed that firing Comey would make him a hero. Over the next forty-eight hours
he spun his side to various friends. It was simple: he had stood up to the FBI. He proved

Consistent with Trump’s desire to change the way
business is conducted in Washington, he also pledges to
act on his first day in office to:

» propose aconstitutional amendment to impose term
limits on all members of Congress;

» require that for every new federal regulation, two
existing regulations must be eliminated; and

» impose a five-year ban on White House and
congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they
leave government service.

Budget. While President-elect Trump has vowed to act
quickly on repeal of the ACA, it is difficult to see how that
can be accomplished outside of reconciliation instructions
for FY 2018. “When we win on November 8th, and elect a
Republican Congress, we will be able to immediately
repeal and replace Obamacare. | will ask Congress to
convene a special session,” he said November 1.

An early focus of attention will be the first Trump budget
proposal and the congressional FY 2018 budget
resolution. As with the past several years under divided
government, a main issue will be how to address the
Budget Control Act sequester for FY 2018. According to
the Congressional Budget Office, the cap on discretionary
budget authority originally established by the Budget
Control Act is set at $1.156 billion in 2018, though it will
be reduced by automatic procedures unless Congress
intervenes. CBO said the reduction will total $91 billion
for 2018: $54 billion for defense and $37 billion in 2018
for nondefense. Therefore, total budget authority is
slatedto be $1.065 trillion, split between $549 billion for
defense and $516 billion for nondefense. Both Trump and
Speaker Ryan want to eliminate the sequester as it
applies to defense, but would likely want to maintain the
sequester for non-defense spending.

As reported in Politico last month, Speaker Ryan is bullish
on using the “budget reconciliation” process to pass
significant tax reform. “Thisis our plan for 2017,” Ryan
said, waving a copy of his “Better Way” policy agenda.
“Much of this you can do through budget reconciliation.”
He said key pieces are “fiscal in nature,” meaning they
can be moved quickly through a budget maneuver that
requires a simple majority in the Senate and House.

Use of “Budget Reconciliation” to enact legislation
involves a two-step process. First, both Chambers of
Congress need to pass a concurrent Budget Resolution
(requires only simple majority in the Senate) that contains
“reconciliation instructions.” These instructions are
directions to committees of jurisdiction to change the
spending or revenue numbers (or both), and to report
back the changes by a date certain. A budget resolution
generally is a legislative vehicle that servesas the
blueprint for fiscal policy and establishes a framework for
consideration of spending and revenue bills for the
coming fiscal year. Technically, a budget resolution isa
“concurrent resolution” which is binding in the House and
the Senate. Because a concurrent resolution is not
submitted to the President for signature, it does not have
the force of law.

The second part of the process is to pass “reconciliation”
bills that adhere to the reconciliation instructions from
the budget resolution.

Reconciliation bills can involve changes to spending,
revenue, or the debt limit (or any combination of the
three). Importantly, these reconciliation bills also only
require a simple majority in the House and Senate for
passage.

Reconciliation bills carry strict debate time and
amendment restrictions, but unlike a budget resolution,
reconciliation legislation contains specific spending and
revenue policy changes that are signed into law by the
President. In the Senate, debate is limited to 20 hours.
While only a simple majority is required for passage in the
Senate, 60 votes are required to waive violations of the
so-called “Byrd rule,” which prohibits the inclusion of
provisions that increase the budget deficit for the period
outside the budget window, usually a 10-year period. An
unlimited number of amendments may be offered and
voted upon, even after the 20 hours of debate have
expired —a process often referred to as a “vote-a-rama’.

This process is attractive because of the simple majority
vote in the Senate, but carries with it restrictionssuch as
the ten-year expiration for titles of the bill that increase
the deficit outside the budget window.

It was used by President George W. Bush to pass
significant tax cut legislation in 2001 (the “Bush tax
cuts”) and is expected to be considered next year for tax
reform. Note that the Bush tax cuts were originally
sunsetted at the end of ten years due to the Byrd

rule. Subsequent legislation passed outside reconciliation
process made many of these provisions permanent.

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028943.txt,"From: Lisa New 
Sent: 12/2/2015 3:17:58 PM 
To: Jeffrey Epstein [jeeyacation@gmail.com] 
Subject: Poetry Update and Thank You 
Importance: High 
Dear Jeffrey, 
May I drop by before the New Year (perhaps on the 9th, or on the 17th or 18th?) to get your advice 
about my renewal of the Templeton campaign, and also my needs in the coming year for Poetry in 
America? Below is the letter I'm sending out to my friends and supporters, and at the bottom a 
message just for you.... 
-Lisa 
That you are receiving this letter means that you are among a special community of friends whose 
support— financial, moral, intellectual, logistical— has allowed my initiative, Poetry in America, to 
realize what seemed, a year ago, almost certainly too ambitious a vision. That vision was to 
produce the highest quality educational video on American poetry, creating a body of 
humanities content capable of reaching a broad community of learners: formal and informal, 
online and residential, young and old, American and international. And it was to 
begin— rapidly— to disseminate and distribute our work. 
Whether you donated to Poetry in America through Filmmaker's Collaborative (our 501c3 fiscal 
sponsor), through Harvard, or through WGBH; whether you appeared on camera or talked an elusive 
friend into appearing on camera to discuss a poem; whether you lent us your film crew, or provided 
overnight use of your hotel suite or apartment or of your whole skyscraper; whether you highlighted 
our work on your stage, or talked your colleagues into becoming corporate sponsors; whether you 
flew to Boston to install state-of-the-art editing and video storage equipment, or asked your children's 
school to let us film there; whether you encouraged your family foundation to take an interest in the 
project, or gave us a lesson in IP, in licensing, in the rudiments of finance, or of distribution; whether 
you praised, or gave timely, much-needed criticism— you enabled what we have done. 
Here's what we have to report, and to show, a year later, thanks to your help. Links offer sneak peeks 
of works -in-progress across the full portfolio of Poetry in America projects. 
• The first eight-episode season of the public television series Poetry in America (a co-
production between WGBH, Emmy Award-winning filmmaker David Grubin, and my own new 
production company, Verse Video), is now fully funded and in production, with episodes featuring Bill  
Clinton, Herbie Hancock and Sonia Sanchez on Langston Hughes, Frank Gehry on Carl Sandburg, 
Katie Couric on Elizabeth Bishop, Nas on Whitman, and many more scheduled for nationwide launch 
in 2017. 
• Poetry in America's many initiatives to reach Middle and High School teachers and their 
students are taking root. Our first online course for Middle and High School Teachers, Poetry of 
the City, will launch this Spring with the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Companion 
materials to this course will be made available for free on PBS LearningMedia. This course is 
designed to meet the needs of English Language Arts and Social Studies teachers in the US and 
internationally. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028943 
• We are eager to begin production of The Poetry of Earth, Sea, and Sky. Designed, too, for 
Middle and High School teachers, The Poetry of Earth, Sea, and Sky will draw English Language Arts 
instruction into dialogue with science, and will include extraordinary footage of the natural world, 
conversations with poets, scholars, and scientists as well as footage shot in class and in the field with 
great teachers. 
• A recent partnership with Greenwich Country Day School and the Success Academy Network 
of charter schools will provide a base for the production of a new collection of classroom-ready 
educational material on The Poetry of Art Sport, and Play. This collection will include discussions 
on poems filmed everywhere from sports fields to Broadway theaters, and will feature dancers, 
athletes, fashion designers, and more. 
• With a growing archive of footage capturing teachers and students reading American poems, 
we are eager to expand our reach and move into America's schools, disseminating, testing, 
and learning from teachers and students using our materials. We hope to be able to begin work 
evaluating the impact of poetry on literacy levels and character development and, eventually, to 
produce a full suite of materials that foster character development along with intellectual growth. 
Working closely with such partners as The Nantucket Project, Nautilus Magazine, The Aspen Ideas 
Festival, and The Big Think, and, of course, HarvardX, Harvard's provider of free open online 
courses, we are continuing to create rich educational media on poetry for adult learners and 
lifelong learners. These materials include short form videos such as this one on Robert Pinsky's  
Shirt (as featured in The New Yorker), and, this spring, the sixth module of the free seven-part 
Poetry in America MOOC, which has registrants in over 150 countries. 
Growing rapidly, and outpacing our current staff and infrastructure, Poetry in America has a 
fundraising goal this year of 2.5 million dollars to fund its expanding group of projects. We've taken a 
big step, hiring the design agency Threespot to help us develop our web presence. Our website— to 
launch early 2016— will eventually serve as an online hub for our TV show and educational projects. 
We hope you'll join us then for a virtual launch! 
Finally, Jeffrey, you have been such a wonderful supporter of my Poetry in America project. The Leon 
Black gift changed everything for me last year. It paid salaries for staff I desperately needed to 
complete projects (detail below), but first and foremost, it gave me leverage, enabling me to set down 
a solid Harvard base for my activities by giving the school something to point to: this public 
humanities project among the list of projects the Dean supports. The money did it: as soon as they 
heard about the gift, they took my project more seriously. Because of that gift, the Faculty of Arts and 
Sciences, which is space-stingy, found and rewired a studio space for me to house my video 
production operation and team. That gift woke up the Deans to the importance of Harvard's role in 
producing the highest quality humanities content for the WORLD, and not just for Harvard students. 
My main employee has half of her salary paid with these funds, and the foundation of our collection 
for PBS LeamingMedia is being made with this support. This gift represented one of the most 
consequential shifts of the last year, allowing me create content and launch projects this year that 
make future projects that much more likely. If I can keep this base sturdy at Harvard, refilling these 
coffers, I will be that much more able to keep working. 
I am also so grateful for the help you gave me in defining my project for Templeton, and, what help 
you have offered to give in bringing them around. I have, since Templeton turned me down, gotten 
funding to produce video on two of the poems I'd proposed to Templeton and to create, and test, that 
video in schools as I proposed. One of my partners in that project is Success Academy, where I could 
also expand my work with Templeton. And there are still other poems that may satisfy their character 
criteria more fully, including the third of the poems I'd originally proposed and that Joe Biden had 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028944 
agreed to discuss with me (on parenthood and humility). At this point, I'm gaining the platform and the 
name recognition to be an effective spokesperson for the foundation on building literacy and 
character in the schools. 
It really means a lot to me, all financial help aside, Jeffrey, that you are rooting for me and thinking 
about me. You push back a lot (as Larry does), and it's always annoying but I always learn. 
With abundant gratitude,

To Change The Tide

After-tax income

After-tax income is equal to market income plus transfer income minus federal taxes paid. In assessing the impact of
various taxes, individual income taxes are allocated directly to households paying those taxes. Social insurance, or
payroll, taxes are allocated to households paying those taxes directly or paying them indirectly through their
employers. Corporate income taxes are allocated to households according to their share of capital income. Federal

excise taxes are allocated to households according to their consumption of the taxed good or service.

Average tax rates are calculated by dividing federal taxes paid by the sum of market income and transfer income.
Negative tax rates result from refundable tax credits, such as the earned income and child tax credits, exceeding the
other taxes owed by people in an income group. (Refundable tax credits are not limited to the amount of income tax

owed before they are applied.)

The Gini Index

The Gini Index is a measure of income inequality based on the relationship between shares of income and shares of
the population. It is a value between 0 and 1.0, with 0 indicating complete equality and 1.0 indicating complete
inequality (in which one household receives all the income). A Gini Index that increases over time indicates rising

income dispersion.

Chart 8 details
Data from Berg, Ostry, and Zettelmeyer (2008).

Authors’ calculations: The height of each factor represents the percentage change in a growth spell between 1950 and
2006 when the factor moves from the 50th percentile to the 60th percentile and all other factors are held constant.
Income distribution uses the Gini coefficient. The political institutions factor is based on an index from the Polity IV
Project database that ranges from +10 for the most open and democratic societies to —10 for the most closed and
autocratic. Trade openness measures the effect of changes in trade liberalization on year-to-year growth.
Exchange-rate competitiveness is calculated as the deviation of an exchange rate from purchasing power parity,

adjusted for per capita income.

A. Yes.
Q. We will come back to your basis for that.
I want to go back to the police report.
We've clarified it never says Professor Dershowitz
abused anyone, correct?

A. It doesn't say that directly, but the police
report is part of a larger package of information that I
had available to me since you asked on December 30th
that suggested that Mr. Dershowitz was involved in the
abuse of minors.

I'm sorry. Let me correct that. In the
sexual abuse of minors, in particularly, minor girls.

Conference (2015), and the National Propaganda Work Conference (2013 and 2018).
When Xi does not give the keynote speech, the Politburo member in charge of that
domain gives it. By contrast, the keynote speech at the National Overseas Chinese
Conference in 2017 was given by Yang Jiechi, who was at that time a state councilor
responsible for foreign affairs.

e The Central Foreign Affairs Work Conference is held at irregular intervals (2006,
2014, and 2018) to review Chinese foreign policy and announce new initiatives
and objectives. It is attended by key ministers, ambassadors, senior military

officers, and local officials responsible for foreign affairs.

e The Central United Front Work Conference, which used to be called the National
United Front Work Conference, is also convened at irregular intervals (2000, 2006,
and 2015). Both national and local officials responsible for religious, ethnic, and

overseas Chinese affairs participate.

e Prior to 2013, the External Propaganda Work Conference was convened annually.
But starting after that year, this conference has become part of the annual National
Propaganda Work Conference. Officials in the propaganda sector from all over

China attend these conferences.

e The National Overseas Chinese Work Conference was held roughly every six years
(2005, 2011, and 2017). Only national and local officials responsible for overseas
Chinese affairs participate.

Hierarchy and Division of Labor

The CCP-affiliated organizations in our diagram that are involved in making policies
concerned with Chinese influence activities abroad enjoy higher political status
than those that execute these policies. What makes the Chinese system notable is
the division of labor, the specialization of its bureaucracies, and the staffing of these
bureaucracies with well-trained and experienced professionals. Besides engaging
their counterparts overseas, these bureaucracies either oversee or directly conduct
influence operations in their areas of specialization. While there exists no single
organization overseeing the entirety of China’s influence activities abroad (although
if any one does have such sweeping purview, it is the Foreign Affairs Commission),

in the implementation of policies aimed to expand Chinese influence abroad, there

They took it away.

As insistently as I, and others in Sayeret Matkal, had wanted to play our part
on the battlefields of the Six-Day War — in the Sinai, on the Golan, in the bitter
battle to capture Jerusalem, or amid the olive-green hills and valleys of the West
Bank — we had to accept that, at most, we’d been freelance support troops. Or
mere spectators. But while it would be many years before this was openly
acknowedlged, we did play an important part in the outcome. Because Dayan
had been called back as Defense Minister only days before the war, he had
wisely decided not to alter the plan for the preemptive air strikes. But he did
adjust our ground advance. Just as with Eshkol’s knowledge of the initial
Egyptian advance in the Sinai before the war, Dayan’s judgements were
informed by detailed, real-time intelligence on where enemy tanks and troops
were located, what they were doing, and what how and when they were
planning to advance.

As speculation mounted after the war about how Israel seemed to know so
much the Arab forces, Meir Amit’s successor as Head of Military Intelligence,
Ahrahle Yariv, even engaged in some misdirection. He was anxious to avoid
jeopardizing future sayeret bugging operations. In a speech on how the war had
been won, he included a reference to a “high-ranking spy” in the Egyptian army
who, he implied, had leaked critical information. The “spy” was the series of
intercepts we’d attached to the Egyptians’ main military communications
network in the Sinai, and to the telephone poles on the Golan Heights.

On a deeply personal level, too, the war left its mark on Sayeret Matkal.
Though the fighting had been brief, people did die. Thousands of Egyptians,
Syrians and Jordanians. And about 650 Israelis. Some of were not just people
we knew. They included close friends. Nechemia Cohen, the officer I’d joined in
our failed attempt to defuse the booby-trap in the Sinai before the war, entered
Gaza on the first day in his new role as deputy commander of Amsalem’s
paratroop unit. Amsalem was killed early on, so Nechemia took command. He
was shot and killed fifteen minutes later. To this day, he and I share the
distinction of being the most decorated soldiers in Israel’s history. Had he lived,
I have no doubt that it is an honor he would have held alone.

This was the first close friend from the unit we’d lost. We did not mourn him
openly. For young soldiers of my generation, especially but not only those raised
with the additional kibbutz ethos of stolid self-control, there was an embedded
sense that such individual displays of emotion were an indulgence, and luxury

highly enriched uranium for medical use rather than approach the amount
needed for a bomb, leading Israeli authorities to predict that Iran wouldn't
be able to build a bomb before 2015 or 2016. Last week, Ali Akbar
Velayati, Khamenei's foreign policy advisor, publicly criticized officials
who have treated the negotiations dismissively. Presumably, he was
thinking of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has compared Iran's
nuclear program to a train without brakes.

Iran is now at the outset of what promises to be a raucous presidential
election, and may be no more capable of serious negotiations between now
and June than the United States was in 2012. But what is clear is that the
sanctions have moderated Iranian behavior and rhetoric. At the same time,
as the Times also noted, the economic pressure is not nearly great enough
to compel concessions that the regime would view as a blow to national
pride. In short, Iran might -- might -- be more willing to accept a face-
saving compromise than they were a year or two ago, but will need serious
inducements to do so.

What would that entail? Virtually all the proposals that have come from
outside experts suggest that the P5+1 begin with modest confidence-
building measures, especially in the period before the election. A recent
report by the Arms Control Association enumerates several of them.
Western diplomats, for example, could take up Ali Akbar Salehi, Iran's
foreign minister, on his proposal to limit the extent of enrichment -- 1.e.,
well below 20 percent -- in exchange for fuel rods for the research reaction
and a recognition of Iran's right to enrich, a notional concept the United
States already supports under specified conditions. Or Iran could suspend
20-percent enrichment in exchange for a suspension of new sanctions. But
Iran is unlikely to accept even such small steps unless it felt that additional
moves would win additional explicit concessions.

Beyond that, the outlines of what in Middle East peacemaking is known as
final status are clear enough: Iran agrees to verifiable inspections to
ensure that it does not enrich uranium beyond 3.5 percent and does not
pursue a nuclear weapons program, while the West accepts Iran's right to
enrich and dismantles sanctions. Of course, the outlines of a Middle East

will suffer. Mirroring has always been a key component of those lessons.

I have been encouraged by some recent acts that have begu n to nip at the asymmetry. For years, the language
of “feeling s” had been reserved for our enemy while we were limited to that of “action;” we would do terrible
acts that would cause bad feelings in the enemy which would then serve to justify whatever response it made. It
had always been a question of the harsh insensitive acts Westerners do against Muslims and the resulting hurt,
loss, shame etc. that Muslims experience. The Ground Zero Mosque incident, however, broke new ground
because all of a sudden non-Muslims’ feelings became the focus and were cast as resulting from Muslim acts.
Another example was seen in how quickly the attempt to blame the Benghazi murders on the video about
Mohammad fell apart. Just as large corporations eventually learned to turn away from shakedown attempts from
race baiters, we are beginning to learn to demand symmetry through mirroring. A word of caution: When
enablers change their behavior and demand symmetrical rules f or the addict, the latter typically initially erupts
with great resistance. This is a stage we must be prepared to tolerate and fully withstand as it creates the only
real chance for the addict to finally change. It is critical, therefore, that when we finally engage in mirroring that
we be prepared to see it through completion.

FP: What if we fail to engage in our own Inner Jihad and the Control Factor stays firmly in place?

Siegel: Critical to the Inner Jihad is the realization that our civilization is fragile; not to be taken for granted.
Our demands for multi-culturalism and diversity have bumped heads with the simple paradox that tolerating the
intolerant leads to extinction. Tolerating the intolerant is perhaps the most crystalline version of asymmetry we
have accepted. Seriously engaged Muslims MUST place the Koran above all law while in America, the
Constitution ranks supreme. As Omar Ahmad , founder of CAIR, reputedly said, “Islam isn’t in Amer ica to be
equal to any other faith, but to become dominant. The Koran is the highest authority in America and Islam is the
only accepted religion on Earth.” Who makes law- the people or Allah? While the Control Factor constantly
seeks for some accommodation between the two, this conflict CAN NOT be negotiated. Only one can survive
not because we have declared “war” but because our Islamic Enemy has. That is, perhaps, the lesson we will
most need to fully learn, one way or another. We will eventually hit a Turnaround Moment as a nation and

if enough of us are not truly prepared to fight and continue to be controlled by our delusions, we will lose. If we
truly seek to win, it is better to get there sooner while we have advantages than later.

starting to run into limits imposed by basic physics. The clock speed of computers
maxed out at a few gigahertz a decade and a half ago, simply because the chips were
starting to melt. The miniaturization of transistors is already running into quantum-
mechanical problems due to tunneling and leakage currents. Eventually, the various
exponential improvements in memory and processing driven by Moore’s Law will
grind to a halt. A few more decades, however, will probably be time enough for the
raw information-processing power of computers to match that of brains—at least by
the crude measures of number of bits and number of bit-flips per second.

Human brains are intricately constructed, the process of millions of years of
natural selection. In Wiener’s time, our understanding of the architecture of the brain
was rudimentary and simplistic. Since then, increasingly sensitive instrumentation and
imaging techniques have shown our brains to be far more varied in structure and
complex in function than Wiener could have imagined. I recently asked Tomaso
Poggio, one of the pioneers of modern neuroscience, whether he was worried that
computers, with their rapidly increasing processing power, would soon emulate the
functioning of the human brain. “Not a chance,” he replied.

The recent advances in deep learning and neuromorphic computation are very
good at reproducing a particular aspect of human intelligence focused on the operation
of the brain’s cortex, where patterns are processed and recognized. These advances
have enabled a computer to beat the world champion not just of chess but of Go, an
impressive feat, but they’re far short of enabling a computerized robot to tidy a room.
(In fact, robots with anything approaching human capability in a broad range of
flexible movements are still far away—search “robots falling down.” Robots are good
at making precision welds on assembly lines, but they still can’t tie their own shoes.)

Raw information-processing power does not mean sophisticated information-
processing power. While computer power has advanced exponentially, the programs
by which computers operate have often failed to advance at all. One of the primary
responses of software companies to increased processing power is to add “useful”
features which often make the software harder to use. Microsoft Word reached its
apex in 1995 and has been slowly sinking under the weight of added features ever
since. Once Moore’s Law starts slowing down, software developers will be confronted
with hard choices between efficiency, speed, and functionality.

A major fear of the singulariteers is that as computers become more involved in
designing their own software they’! rapidly bootstrap themselves into achieving
superhuman computational ability. But the evidence of machine learning points in the
opposite direction. As machines become more powerful and capable of learning, they
learn more and more as human beings do—from multiple examples, often under the
supervision of human and machine teachers. Education is as hard and slow for
computers as it is for teenagers. Consequently, systems based on deep learning are
becoming more rather than less human. The skills they bring to learning are not
“better than” but “complementary to” human learning: Computer learning systems can
identify patterns that humans cannot—and vice versa. The world’s best chess players
are neither computers nor humans but humans working together with computers.
Cyberspace is indeed inhabited by harmful programs, but these primarily take the form
of malware—viruses notable for their malign mindlessness, not for their

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023398.txt,"In re: TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001., 2012 WL 257568 (2012)

See supra p. 56 n.89. The Golden Chain has also been used by the U.S. Treasury Department in designating persons as
Specially Designated Global Terrorists. See supra p. 55 n.86.

The district court committed further error by failing to credit plaintiffs’ allegations that DMI Trust, Dallah al Baraka, and
Saleh Abdullah Kamel controlled their subsidiaries that provided material support to al-Qaeda. See SPA245, 247 (Terrorist
Attacks V); SPA109 (DMI-Kamel); SPA60 (Terrorist Attacks I). A plaintiff sufficiently pleads an ATA claim by alleging that
the defendant provided material support to terrorists through an entity that the defendant controlled. See Wyatt, 785 F. Supp.
2d at 648 (finding that plaintiffs stated an ATA claim where they alleged that company controlled intermediary through
which it provided material support). As the D.C. Circuit explained, “[w]hen one entity so dominates and controls another that
they must be considered principal and agent, it is appropriate, under [the ATA], to look past their separate juridical identities
*116 and to treat them as aliases.” Nat’l Council of Resistance of Iran v. Dep’t of State, 373 F.3d 152, 157 (D.C. Cir. 2004).

The plaintiffs’ allegations met this standard. For example, plaintiffs allege that DMI Trust and DMI S.A. “directly participate
in the oversight and management of DMI Trust’s subsidiary and associate entities.” JA4329. In addition, DMI Administrative
Services, S.A. is alleged to be “a wholly owned subsidiary directly controlled by DMI Trust,” JA4330, and DMI Trust is
alleged to have “direct involvement” over Faisal Islamic Bank, JA4331. Plaintiffs also allege that Kamel “headed” Dallah al
Baraka and its wholly-owned subsidiary, ABID Corp., which “exercised control and direction” over numerous subsidiaries.
JA1782, 3122, 3832.

C. The District Court Incorrectly Disregarded Extensive Allegations of Support to al-Qaeda by Defendants Dallah al
Baraka and Saleh Abdullah Kamel in the Early to Mid 1990s

The district court also found that the plaintiffs had not pled “the requisite causal connection” for their ATA claims against
Dallah al Baraka and Saleh Abdullah Kamel because “the alleged provision of material support” to “Osama bin Laden ...
during the early 1990s ... is too remote from the 9/11 terrorist attacks ....” SPA247 (Terrorist Attacks V). This conclusion
resulted from a legal error regarding the applicable pleading *117 standard and a legal error regarding the inferences that may
reasonably be drawn about support for terrorism, especially against the backdrop of Congress’ intended scope of the ATA.
The court also made a critical factual error that necessitates correction.

First, the district court incorrectly applied a heightened pleading standard regarding this specific issue. To establish causation
when an undefined period of time separates the material support alleged from the terrorist attack, the district court required
that the plaintiffs plead:

sufficient factual allegations of a connection between the material support provided and the acts of
terrorism that caused plaintiffs’ injuries, such that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that it was
more likely than not that the support provided by the defendant assisted the terrorists in the commission
of the terrorist act.

Id. at 239 (emphasis added). The court’s “more likely than not” and “reasonable trier of fact” requirements are mconsistent
with Igbal/ Twombly, which only require that a plaintiff plead facts that permit “the court to draw the reasonable inference
that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Jgbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949. The district court’s standard therefore
imposed a much greater burden on the plaintiffs than is permitted at this stage of the proceeding.

*118 In addition, the inference that support for al-Qaeda in the early and mid 1990s contributed to al-Qaeda’s capabilities and
terrorist activities only a few years later, in 2001, is entirely reasonable -- indeed, any other conclusion is unreasonable.

Plaintiffs’ allegation, which must at this stage be taken as true, was that support in the years leading up to the September 11
attacks, including support for al-Qaeda in Sudan, was essential to al-Qaeda’s ability to achieve the global scale and capability

These dramatic revelations finally came to light because of Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald's search for
evidence of his own innocence, which he has protested since the beginning of his case. Over
many years, he and his lawyers filed requests under the Freedom of Information Act, seeking
access to the government documents on the case—the documents that contained the facts that
were not revealed during the trial. Slowly, they pieced together the amazing scientific and
evidentiary story that the jury never heard.

It is a story that raises the following disturbing questions;

Why would the government suppress such critical evidence? It is impossible to know the mind-
set of the chief government lawyer in the case: Brian Murtagh, whose responsibility it was to see
that the defense received any evidence in the government's file, which could help the defense. We
do, however, know that he was aware of the contents of the lab notes. Since he wrote a memo to
a legal assistant asking him whether the detailed data of a lab report; as distinguished from the
conclusions of the report, (must) be disclosed (to the defense). This question is significant,
because the detailed data refers to the blonde wig hair, the black wool, and the human hairs,
which were described in the handwritten lab notes but somehow not mentioned in the lab's final
typed report.

Murtagh has refused comment, except for a cryptic statement that if there were fibers useful to
the defense, MacDonald's original trial lawyers should have found them among the crates of raw
evidence to which they had access. Talk about needles in haystacks!

How much more exculpatory evidence may be hidden in some government file—or may have
been destroyed or lost—we will probably never know. For example, a fragment of human skin
was found under one of Colette MacDonald's fingernails. Yet, unbelievable as it sounds, the
government claims that it lost this singularly important item of evidence. Prosecutors in several
other cases in which I’ve been involved have mysteriously “lost” evidence that could prove
innocence. If that skin fragment were now available, it could prove conclusively—through DNA
matching—whether or not Jeffrey MacDonald was the killer. Even without DNA testing (which
was not available at the time of the original investigation) it could have cleared MacDonald.

Will the new evidence finally get Jeffrey MacDonald the new trial he has been seeking since he
was convicted in 1979? Ifthe government suppressed the lab notes and other evidence--and if
this evidence was material to the issue of MacDonald's guilt or innocence—a new trial should
certainly be granted.

But several problems remain: First, most Americans who have read the book or seen the TV
movie of Fatal Vision already know that Jeffrey MacDonald is guilty. They know it because the
Jeffrey MacDonald portrayed in those one-sided presentations was guilty. On TV, the actor, Gary
Cole, played him guilty. The evidence shown to the audience—like the evidence presented to the
real-life jury—did not include the physical evidence that corroborates the Stoeckley confessions.
Nor did it include the evidence that the prosecutor pressured Stoeckly to lie about her memory.

I woke up this morning, and given that it’s Monday, I checked my e-mail for one hour after an
exquisite Buenos Aires breakfast.

Sowmya from India had found a long-lost high school classmate of mine, and Anakool from YMII
had put together Excel research reports for retiree happiness and the average annual hours worked in
different fields. Interviews for this week had been set by a third Indian virtual assistant, who had also
found contact information for the best Kendo schools in Japan and the top salsa teachers in Cuba. In the
next e-mail folder, I was pleased to see that my fulfillment account manager in Tennessee, Beth, had
resolved nearly two dozen problems in the last week—keeping our largest clients in China and South
Africa smiling—and had also coordinated California sales tax filing with my accountants in Michigan.
The taxes had been paid via my credit card on file, and a quick glance at my bank accounts confirmed
that Shane and the rest of the team at my credit card processor were depositing more cash than last
month. All was right in the world of automation.

It was a beautiful sunny day, and I closed my laptop with a smile. For an all-you-can-eat buffet

GQyrrins a remote personal assistant is a huge departure point and marks the moment that you learn

how to give orders and be commander instead of the commanded. It is small-scale training wheels for the
most critical of NR skills: remote management and communication.

It is time to learn how to be the boss. It isn’t time-consuming. It’s low-cost and it’s low-risk. Whether
or not you “need” someone at this point is immaterial. It is an exercise.

It is also a litmus test for entrepreneurship: Can you manage (direct and chastise) other people? Given
the proper instruction and practice, I believe so. Most entrepreneurs fail because they jump into the deep
end of the pool without learning to swim first. Using a virtual assistant (VA) as a simple exercise with no
downside, the basics of management are covered in a 24-week test costing between $100—400. This is
an investment, not an expense, and the ROI is astounding. It will be repaid in a maximum of 10-14 days,
after which it is pure timesaving profit.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020060.txt,"“So we're going to do it,” insisted Bannon, with joie de guerre and manic energy, “the
way they did it. Separate war room, separate lawyers, separate spokespeople. It’s keeping
that fight over there so we can wage this other fight over here. Everybody gets this. Well,
maybe not Trump so much. Not clear. Maybe a little. Not what he imagined.”

Bannon, in great excitement, and Priebus, grateful for an excuse to leave the
president’s side, rushed back to the West Wing to begin to cordon it off.

It did not escape Priebus’s notice that Bannon had in mind to create a rear guard of
defenders—David Bossie, Corey Lewandowski, and Jason Miller, all of whom would be
outside spokespeople—that would largely be loyal to him. Most of all, it did not escape
Priebus that Bannon was asking the president to play a role entirely out of character: the
cool, steady, long-suffering chief executive.

And it certainly didn’t help that they were unable to hire a law firm with a top-notch
white-collar government practice. By the time Bannon and Priebus were back in
Washington, three blue-chip firms had said no. All of them were afraid they would face a
rebellion among the younger staff if they represented Trump, afraid Trump would publicly
humiliate them if the going got tough, and afraid Trump would stiff them for the bill.

In the end, nine top firms turned them down.

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 032235 
"
IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013860.txt,"4. Speaking of 30 minutes, if you absolutely cannot stop a meeting or call from happening, define the end
time. Do not leave these discussions open-ended, and keep them short. If things are well-defined,
decisions should not take more than 30 minutes. Cite other commitments at odd times to make them more
believable (e.g., 3:20 vs. 3:30) and force people to focus instead of socializing, commiserating, and
digressing. If you must join a meeting that is scheduled to last a long time or that is open-ended, inform
the organizer that you would like permission to cover your portion first, as you have a commitment in 15
minutes. If you have to, feign an urgent phone call. Get the hell out of there and have someone else
update you later. The other option is to be completely transparent and voice your opinion of how
unnecessary the meeting is. If you choose this route, be prepared to face fire and offer alternatives.

5. The cubicle is your temple—don’t permit casual visitors. Some suggest using a clear “do not disturb”
sign of some type, but I have found that this is ignored unless you have an office. My approach was to
put headphones on, even if I wasn’t listening to anything. If someone approached me despite this
discouragement, I would pretend to be on the phone. I’d put a finger to my lips, say something like, “I
hear you,” and then say into the mic, “Can you hold on a second?” Next, I’d turn to the invader and say,
“Hi. What can I do for you?” I wouldn’t let them “get back to me” but rather force the person to give me
a five-second summary and then send me an e-mail if necessary.

If headphone games aren’t your thing, the reflexive response to an invader should be the same as when
answering the cell phone: “Hi, invader. I’m right in the middle of something. How can I be of help?” If
it’s not clear within 30 seconds, ask the person to send you an e-mail about the chosen issue; do not offer
to send them an e-mail first: “Il be happy to help, but I have to finish this first. Can you send me a
quick e-mail to remind me?” If you still cannot deflect an invader, give the person a time limit on your
availability, which can also be used for phone conversations: “OK, I only have two minutes before a call,
but what’s the situation and what can I do to help?”

6. Use the Puppy Dog Close to help your superiors and others develop the no-meeting habit. The Puppy
Dog Close in sales is so named because it is based on the pet store sales approach: If someone likes a
puppy but is hesitant to make the life-altering purchase, just offer to let them take the pup home and
bring it back if they change their minds. Of course, the return seldom happens.

The Puppy Dog Close is invaluable whenever you face resistance to permanent changes. Get your foot
in the door with a “let’s just try it once” reversible trial.

Compare the following:

“T think you’d love this puppy. It will forever add to your responsibilities until he dies 10 years from
now. No more care-free vacations, and you'll finally get to pick up poop all over the city— what do
you think?”

Vs.
Now imagine walking up to your boss in the hallway and clapping a hand on her shoulder:
“I'd like to go to the meeting, but I have a better idea. Let’s never have another one, since all we do is
waste time and not decide anything useful.”

VS.

The second set of alternatives seem less permanent, and they’re intended to appear so. Repeat this

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016389.txt,"Even though a supercomputer can “train” a clone of zemself in seconds, the
energy cost of producing a mature silicon clone is comparable. Engineering (Homo)
prodigies might make a small impact on this slow process, but speeding up development
and implanting extensive memory (as DNA-exabytes or other means) could reduce
duplication time of a bio-computer to close to the doubling time of cells (ranging from
eleven minutes to twenty-four hours). The point is that while we may not know what
ratio of bio/homo/nano/robo hybrids will be dominant at each step of our accelerating
evolution, we can aim for high levels of humane, fair, and safe treatment (“use”) of one
another.

Bills of Rights date back to 1689 in England. FDR proclaimed the “Four
Freedoms”’—freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, freedom from fear, and freedom
from want. The U.N.’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 included the
right to life; the prohibition of slavery; defense of rights when violated; freedom of
movement; freedom of association, thought, conscience, and religion; social, economic,
and cultural rights; duties of the individual to society; and prohibition of use of rights in
contravention of the purposes and principles of the United Nations.

The “universal” nature of these rights is not universally embraced and is subject
to extensive critique and noncompliance. How does the emergence of non-Homo-
intelligences affect this discussion? At a minimum, it is becoming rapidly difficult to
hide behind vague intuition for ethical decisions—“I know it when I see it” (U.S.
Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart, 1964) or the “wisdom of repugnance” (aka “yuck
factor,” Leon Kass, 1997), or vague appeals to “common sense.” As we have to deal
with minds alien to us, sometimes quite literal from our viewpoint, we need to be
explicit—yea, even algorithmic.

Self-driving cars, drones, stock-market transactions, NSA searches, et cetera,
require rapid, pre-approved decision making. We may gain insights into many aspects of
ethics that we have been trying to pin down and explain for centuries. The challenges
have included conflicting priorities, as well as engrained biological, sociological, and
semi-logical cognitive biases. Notably far from consensus in universal dogmas about
human rights are notions of privacy and dignity, even though these influence many laws
and guidelines.

Humans might want the right to march in to read (and change) the minds of
computers to see why they’re making decisions at odds with our (Homo) instincts. Is it
not fair for machines to ask the same of us? We note the growth of movements toward
transparency in potential financial conflicts; “open-source” software, hardware, and
wetware; the Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act (FASTR); and the
Open Humans Foundation.

In his 1976 book Computer Power and Human Reason, Joseph Weizenbaum
argued that machines should not replace Homo in situations requiring respect, dignity, or
care, while others (author Pamela McCorduck and computer scientists like John
McCarthy and Bill Hibbard) replied that machines can be more impartial, calm, and
consistent and less abusive or mischievous than people in such positions.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020074.txt,"And yet, contravening all cultural and media logic, Donald Trump produced on a daily
basis an astonishing, can’t-stop-following-it narrative. And this was not even because he
was changing or upsetting the fundamentals of American life. In six months as president,
failing to master almost any aspect of the bureaucratic process, he had, beyond placing his
nominee on the Supreme Court, accomplished, practically speaking, nothing. And yet,
OMG!!! There almost was no other story in America—and in much of the world. That was
the radical and transformational nature of the Trump presidency: it held everybody’s
attention.

Inside the White House, the daily brouhaha and world’s fascination was no cause for
joy. It was, in the White House staff’s bitter view, the media that turned every day into a
climactic, dastardly moment. And, in a sense, this was correct: every development cannot
be climactic. The fact that yesterday’s climax would soon, compared to the next climax, be
piddling, rather bore out the disproportion. The media was failing to judge the relative
importance of Trump events: most Trump events came to naught (arguably all of them
did), and yet all were greeted with equal shock and horror. The White House staff believed
that the media’s Trump coverage lacked “context’”—by this, they meant that people ought
to realize that Trump was mostly just huffing and puffing.

At the same time, few in the White House did not assign blame to Trump for this as
well. He seemed to lack the most basic understanding that a president’s words and actions
would, necessarily, be magnified to the nth power. In some convenient sense, he failed to
understand this because he wanted the attention, no matter how often it disappointed him.
But he also wanted it because again and again the response surprised him—and, as though
every time was the first time, he could not modify his behavior.

Sean Spicer caught the brunt of the daily drama, turning this otherwise reasonable,
mild-mannered, process-oriented professional into a joke figure standing at the White
House door. In his daily out-of-body experience, as a witness to his own humiliation and
loss for words, Spicer understood after a while—although he began to understand this
beginning his first day on the job when dealing with the dispute about the inaugural
audience numbers—that he had “gone down a rabbit hole.” In this disorienting place, all
public artifice, pretense, proportion, savvy, and self-awareness had been cast off, or—
possibly another result of Trump never really intending to be president—never really
figured into the state of being president.

On the other hand, constant hysteria did have one unintended political virtue. If every
new event canceled out every other event, like some wacky news-cycle pyramid scheme,
then you always survived another day.

OOK Ok

Donald Trump’s sons, Don Jr., thirty-nine, and Eric, thirty-three, existed in an enforced
infantile relationship to their father, a role that embarrassed them, but one that they also

Vol in crude continues to collapse

Oil 
A relatively quiet day in Crude today. We hovered around unchanged for most of the day before selling off in the 
afternoon and testing 50$ BRE again. However, we failed to break it and rallied towards unchanged for the close, 
perhaps off the back of some index buying. Newswise, Feb Azeri BTC loadings will be up a whopping 11% m/o/m to 
821kbd. Interestingly, there is apparently some floating storage interest happening as well, as some major phys trading 
firms have booked long term tankers for this as long term charter rates are cheaper and thus make the economics of 
storage look good. The window was again weak with ekofisk and brent offered down a bit. In other news, RTRS cites GCC 
sources saying that there is no chance of OPEC cut even though oil has dipped to 50$...Stateside, we learned yesterday 
that the Seaway Twin is moving 100% heavy crude. Furthermore, USGC diffs weakened again, with LLS now trading 1$ 
above WTI. In the morning WTI spreads were quite bid, but that abated towards the end of the day. The arb did 
however stay bid throughout the day, as the fact that LLS/WTI is tight at 1$ means that there is more room BRE to 
discount vs LLS so as to place those Jan and Feb overhang cargoes in the US. In politics land, the Senate committee voted 
13-9 to have Keystone bypass presidential approval. So if the Senate passes this bill (which it should as it has 60 co 
sponsors), Obama may have to veto it. It is not clear that the Senate has 67 votes needed to overturn the veto, so this 
should be interesting to follow...In products land, distillate bounced back a bit after yesterday's post stats ugly showing, 
perhaps off the realization that the stats didn't add up along with the extremely cold weather giving NG a (rare) bid as 
well... 
Oil Vols  
Another day of carnage in oil vols today. Early morning NY vols were down 0.4-0.5 through the curve, but a one way 
selling streak started just before the open and all the bids out there started getting hit. As an example Dec5 atm 
straddles started the day 1465/1505, were 1405/1450 at 9am, and were 1350/1390 later in the day. Within 2 hours of 
open, vols were down about 3 vols across the curve..and stayed there for most of the day till about 1:30pm when 
futures took a quick leg lower., prompt vols traded 1.5% higher than close at that time and Jun5 was up 2% from the 
lows. However, with a quick rally back vols started fading again and ended 1.5-2.5 lower. 
Wings got smashed again and put skew collapsed quickly. 8000 lots of $40puts in WTI Mar15 were sold on the screen, 
which is quite an impressive volume outside floor trading..

Imagine you wanted to find the center of a maze. Is there a way to
speed searching the maze, so you do not have to test every branch? If
you can provide a mathematical proof that there is or is not, you win the
prize.

Places Game

While it is commonly assumed NP problems are the hardest, this is not
the case. There are quite a few that are harder still. One such is called a
PSPACE problem. It’s quite difficult to explain but luckily many of you
will have played a form of it on long car trips when you were a child: My
family calls it The Places Game.

I will pick a place —- “London; and you must then pick another place,
say, ‘New York, that starts with the letter my place ends with. Pll then
pick ‘Canterbury’ and my kids will laugh at my dyslexia and I'll have to
switch to ‘Kansas’ and so on. Once you use a place you can’t use it again.

The mathematical question is to predict who will win given each
player has a finite list of places they know? It turns out this type of
problem is even harder to solve than an NP problem. This is because
on each turn a player gets to pick any name from their list. With the
traveling salesman problem, there is only one ‘player’ — the salesman -
so we can write out a route and check it. In the Places Game there is
no single route through the game because, after I pick my favorite town
‘London; you can pick any place beginning with ‘N’ I have to anticipate
an enormous table of possible paths through the game. The table takes
huge physical space — which is where PSPACE gets its name.

Remember I’m just playing the simplest mathematical games with
bits of paper and discrete ideas. I haven't strayed into the quantum
world yet. That brings with it a whole new level of complexity to explore.
Complexity is such a diverse subject that Scott Aaronson of MIT has
created a web site called the complexity zoo to catalogue all the different
‘species. It is much to complex to reproduce here but let me provide a

sketch.

The Complexity Hierarchy

My table below represents the hierarchical complexity of knowledge.
We start off with the problems both humans and computers find easy,
then rapidly move onto problems that even the fastest machines find
difficult: a perfect game of chess or predicting the weather. Above these
computable problems are the non-computable ones which no computer

Anatoly Sharansky: Death For Spying For the United States

Other potential death cases raised issues not of science, but of politics, diplomacy and economics.
The case that combined these elements also involved the client with whom I most closely
identified personally. He was a Soviet Jew who I never even met during the years I was fighting
to save his life. His name (at the time) was Anatoly Sharansky (now Natan Sharansky).

Sharansky was a prominent and vocal defender of human rights, not only of his fellow Soviet
Jews but of all victims of Soviet oppression. He worked closely with Andrei Saklarov, the father
of the Soviet nuclear weapons program who had become the leading voice for human rights in the
Soviet Union.

Sharansky was arrested by the Soviet KGB in 2003 [check] on charges of spying for the United
States—a charge that carried the death penalty. I had previously represented two Jewish
Refusenicks who had tried to steal a small airplane in which to escape to Israel, via Sweden. They
had been sentenced to death, so I knew that the threat of capital punishment against Sharansky
was real. Their death sentences against were later reversed and they were eventually allowed to
emigrate to Israel. But there was no assurance that similar efforts would help Sharansky, who
faced the more serious charge of spying for an enemy.

I had been asked, along with Canadian law professor Irwin Cotler, to represent Sharanksy. The
request came from his wife, who was in Israel, and his mother, who lived in Moscow. They had
no money to pay for a lawyer. We agreed to do what we could to save his life and, hopefully,
secure his freedom.

Our first job was to try to get the espionage charge dropped, since that was the one that carried
the death sentence. Because Sharanksy was accused of spying for the United States, I decided to
go directly to the White House to try to persuade President Carter to issue a statement expressly
denying the Soviet charge that Sharansky had been a CIA operative. We faced great pressure
from the CIA to continue the longstanding American policy of never affirming or denying
anyone’s alleged association with the agency. But after several requests, President Carter did
issue the following statement:

I have inquired deeply within the State Department and within the CIA, as to whether or
not Mr. Sharanksy has ever had any known relationship in a subversive way, or otherwise,
with the CIA. The answer is “no.” We have double-checked this, and I have been
hesitant to make that public announcement, but now I am completely convinced.

Shortly after President Carter made his unprecedented statement, the Soviet prosecutors dropped
the espionage charge and took the death penalty off the table. But they were still determined to
see Sharansky die in prison. The Soviets called it “special regime” imprisonment, consisting of a
diet that no one could long survive. The prisoners called it “death on the installment plan.”

Sharansky’s wife pleaded with me to get him out of prison before he starved to death and before

she was too old to have children. We had saved him from execution; now we had to save him
from starvation. We had our work cut out for us.

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024385.txt,"on. As I would learn one stunning aspect after another, I would discuss them with friends and associates. Rather
than confront the facts I would present, they would find one clever way after another to avoid the frightening
truth of what America and the West truly face. Their fear appeared obvious to me. I began to catalog many of
my friends’ different maneuvers to dispel the anxiety that they found so difficult to endure. The more I focused
on their mental processes (as well as my own) the more I began to see a structure to the mental endeavor and to
understand what I had, as a child, found so difficult to explain.

FP: Tell us about the Control Factor, what you describe as “that effort our minds enga ge in in order to keep us
blind” and that “process of a voiding seeing the threats we face.” It’s also about, as you state, trying to believe
that the threat is under our control, when in fact it is not. Kindly enlighten us as to these profound insights you
make in terms of the Control Factor.

Siegel: First, let’s distinguish the ”real world” where real battles are taking place from the mental battlefield
which occurs in each of our minds. We tend to believe our perceptions are simply clear realizations of what is
“out there” and overlook how much our internal worlds can literally determine what we see. When our internal
minds become anxious and sense a loss of “control,” they tend to concoct ways to distort our perceptions so as
to restore that sense of inner control. I describe the Control Factor as an “active and continuous process”
designed to maintain that sense, if not illusion, of control. We natural ly think that our thinking and feeling
processes are passive; that they just happen. Yet when faced with truly frightening prospects, the mind is geared
to actively distort.

Similarly, the sense of control must be continuously maintained so the Control Factor operates constantly. In
turn, the sum of this active and continuous undertaking makes these perceptions all the more familiar and thus
seemingly all the more “real.” In one sense, the Control Factor is the mechanism of what Andy McCarthy
entitled one of his numerous excellent books- willful blindness. The Control Factor is cleverer than we are
aware; that is almost tautological as, if our minds are to create ways to keep us in denial, they must out
maneuver our conscious thinking.

Since World War II, America has had limited experience with threats coming to the homeland. Most of
America’s history has been about “over there,” where we have always known that if things got too out of hand
(e.g. Vietnam) we could always ret urn home. The current generations, for a wide array of reasons, have had
virtually no experience with a threat to this land. (The documentary, Generation Zero, is interesting on this
point).

Consequently, the process of waking up to such a threat parallels the arc of a typical horror film. In such a film,
there is typically a cast of characters surrounding one or two main characters. We in the audience know there is
a threat coming — be it a monster, a virus, a psycho killer, an alien, the blob that ate Cincinnati etc. This threat is
typically defined by its intent- the singular goal of destroying the characters. Much of the initial exposition
shows how the characters first are oblivious to the destruction the threat brings about, then explain it in familiar
terms only to finally open their eyes to see that something uniquely terrifying is happening. The next stage
usually involves a series of failed attempts to deal with the threat- fr om trying to negotiate with it, to appease it,
to coax it, to threaten it with ineffective weapons and so forth. Most of these failings are due to not adequately
appreciating the threat for what it truly is and projecting onto it a host of other attributes instead. The final stage
generally involves a back-up-against-the-wall decision by whichever characters remain alive. I named this the
“turnaround moment” when the character becomes willing to be as ruthless as the threat. That change in mental
state is necessary to ensure survival. Ultimately, the storyline is a race for whichever characters remain to wake
up fully and use whatever advantages they may still have to beat the threat.

This is the same arc our minds go through in battling our own Control Factors, our own compulsions to deny
that which is staring us in the face. Ultimately, the question is whether we will be able to wake up while we still
have advantages and give ourselves permis sion to fully fight the battle we are in.

I said ear lier that there is a structure to the Control Factor. To oversimplify, I view it much as a pyramid where
on the bottom are the many minute by minute thoughts that are manipulated. I call this level of maneuvers the
many ”D’s” as they include the psychological defenses such as distortion, denial, demonization, deflection,
deletion, detachment, delusion, displacement, discolorization and so forth. Layered upon these are moves such

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016831.txt,"Computer scientist Stuart Russell, along with Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking, Max
Tegmark, and numerous others, has insisted that attention be paid to the potential
dangers in creating an intelligence on the superhuman (or even the human) level—an
AGI, or artificial general intelligence, whose programmed purposes may not necessarily
align with our own.

His early work was on understanding the notion of “bounded optimality” as a
formal definition of intelligence that you can work on. He developed the technique of
rational meta-reasoning, “which is, roughly speaking, that you do the computations that
you expect to improve the quality of your ultimate decision as quickly as possible.” He
has also worked on the unification of probability theory and first-order logic—resulting
in a new and far more effective monitoring system for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test
Ban Treaty—and on the problem of decision making over long timescales (his
presentations on the latter topic are usually titled, “Life: Play and Win in 20 trillion
moves”’).

He is very concerned with the continuing development of autonomous weapons,
such as lethal micro-drones, which are potentially scalable into weapons of mass
destruction. He drafted the letter from forty of the world’s leading AI researchers to
President Obama which resulted in high-level national-security meetings.

His current work centers on the creation of what he calls “provably beneficial”
AI. He wants to ensure AI safety by “imbuing systems with explicit uncertainty” about
the objectives of their human programmers, an approach that would amount to a fairly
radical reordering of current AI research.

Stuart is also on the radar of anyone who has taken a course in computer science
in the last twenty-odd years. He is co-author of “the” definitive AI textbook, with an
estimated 5-million-plus English-language readers.

was a scientist manqué and was eager, as soon as I arrived in his office, to hear
about my physics studies. When I did manage to turn the conversation to the
army, I told him I was thinking of returning after I graduated. Yet before finally
deciding, I wanted his honest opinion about my chances, at some point, of being
given command of the sayeret. He began with a series of caveats. The choice of
future leaders of the sayeret was not be his to make. When the current
commander, Uzi Yairi, ended his term in roughly 18 months’ time, Id still be
too young to have a realistic chance. “Maybe even next time around,” he said.
And in any case, I would first need to get some experience in the regular army.
“But then,” he concluded, “my opinion is that you have a very good chance of
becoming commander of the unit.” That was more than enough. I figured that
whether it actually happened would now ultimately be down to me.

My last year at university was the closest thing I would have to a normal
student existence. I was called away only once. But it was for a battle which
would turn out to have a lasting impact on the course of our conflict with the
Arabs, and on the prospects of eventually finding a way to make peace. It was
Israel’s largest military action since the war, across our new de facto border with
Jordan. And it was directed at a new enemy: a fledgling army of Palestinian
fedayeen, called Fatah. It was led by a man that I, like almost all Israelis, had
never heard of at the time: Yasir Arafat. Born in Egypt, as a 19-year-old he had
fought against the establishment of Israel in the 1948 war. Although Fatah had
nominally existed for nearly a decade, it was only now emerging as a political
force, in large part because of the Arab armies’ humiliating defeat in the Six-
Day War. A Palestinian political leadership already existed, in the shape of the
Palestine Liberation Ogranization. But it was based in Cairo. Its chairman was,
for all practical purposes, an adjunct of President Nasser’s leadership role in the
Arab world. Though Arafat had not yet explicitly challenged this state of affairs,
his, and Fatah’s, rise after the war carried a powerful, message for the existing
Arab presidents and prime ministers: their brash promises of victory before the

be drafted and passed into law. There could be no giant leap into the
unknown because decisions taken now would affect Syria for decades
to come.

The speech will disappoint all those who had hoped for immediate
and dramatic reforms. The President served up a diet of words rather
than of actions. He did mention, however, that elections would take
place in August, and that among the bills to be discussed would be a
new electoral law, a law allowing for the formation of political
parties, a media law, a law to give greater powers to municipal
authorities, and the need to amend or even entirely rewrite the
Constitution. He seemed to be indicating that the notorious Article 8
of the Constitution, which gives the Ba‘th party a “leading role in
state and society,” might be scrapped.

This may well prove hard to achieve. Having enjoyed a monopoly on
the political scene since 1963, Syria’s Ba‘th party has long since
become rigid and Stalinist, and is probably incapable of sharing
power with other parties. More battles lie ahead.

To all but his diehard political enemies, President Asad seemed
thoughtful and even conciliatory. He did not look like a leader
battling for survival. No doubt, the credits outweigh the debits in his
personal profit-and-loss account. He knows that he need fear no
foreign military intervention: After Libya, no Western power would
even contemplate it. Some soldiers have defected to the rebels, but
there has been no major split in the army or the security services, or
in the regime itself. Whatever disputes and dissensions there may
have been in the ruling circle have been carefully hidden from view.
He knows that so long as they remain united, it will be difficult, if not
impossible, for the opposition to topple him.

At the UN and elsewhere, Syria enjoys the protection of Russia --
perhaps concerned for its naval base at Tartus. The Russian view is
that the Syrian crisis poses no threat to international peace and

through this bypath of neural networks.

But simple neural networks didn’t do much. Frank Rosenblatt invented a learning
device he called the perceptron, which was a one-layer neural network. In the late sixties,
Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert wrote a book titled Perceptrons, in which they
basically proved that perceptrons couldn’t do anything interesting, which is correct.
Perceptrons could only make linear distinctions between things. So the idea was more or
less dropped. People said, “These guys have written a proof that neural networks can’t
do anything interesting, therefore no neural networks can do anything interesting, so let’s
forget about neural networks.” That attitude persisted for some time.

Meanwhile, there were a couple of other approaches to AI. One was based on
understanding, at a formal level, symbolically, how the world works; and the other was
based on doing statistics and probabilistic kinds of things. With regard to symbolic AI,
one of the test cases was, Can we teach a computer to do something like integrals? Can
we teach a computer to do calculus? There were tasks like machine translation, which
people thought would be a good example of what computers could do. The bottom line is
that by the early seventies, that approach had crashed.

Then there was a trend toward devices called expert systems, which arose in the
late seventies and early eighties. The idea was to have a machine learn the rules that an
expert uses and thereby figure out what to do. That petered out. After that, AI became
little more than a crazy pursuit.

I had been interested in how you make an AJI-like machine since I was a kid. I was
interested particularly in how you take the knowledge we humans have accumulated in
our civilization and automate answering questions on the basis of that knowledge. I
thought about how you could do that symbolically, by building a system that could break
down questions into symbolic units and answer them. I worked on neural networks at
that time and didn’t make much progress, so I put it aside for a while.

Back in mid-2002 to 2003, I thought about that question again: What does it take
to make a computational knowledge system? The work I’d done by then pretty much
showed that my original belief about how to do this was completely wrong. My original
belief had been that in order to make a serious computational knowledge system, you first
had to build a brainlike device and then feed it knowledge—just as humans learn in
standard education. Now I realized that there wasn’t a bright line between what is
intelligent and what is simply computational.

I had assumed that there was some magic mechanism that made us vastly more
capable than anything that was just computational. But that assumption was wrong. This
insight is what led to Wolfram|Alpha. What I discovered is that you can take a large
collection of the world’s knowledge and automatically answer questions on the basis of
it, using what are essentially merely computational techniques. It was an alternative way
to do engineering—a way that’s much more analogous to what biology does in evolution.

In effect, what you normally do when you build a program 1s build it step-by-step.
But you can also explore the computational universe and mine technology from that
universe. Typically, the challenge is the same as in physical mining: That is, you find a
supply of, let’s say, iron, or cobalt, or gadolinium, with some special magnetic properties,

the United States could attempt to convince non-Hamas elements in
the PA to use and disseminate U.S. funds without any knowledge or
participation of Hamas. Yet such a plan may not withstand legal
scrutiny. If non-Hamas PA officials failed to honor the agreement and
Hamas gained access to U.S. funds, prosecutors might one day argue
that the persons who made the donation knew that such a result was
likely and disregarded the risk. Such “willful blindness” could serve
as the basis of a criminal prosecution. Or, the whole government may
turn out to be Hamas-affiliated, rendering any such distinction
meaningless.

The Obama administration could also instruct OFAC to grant specific
exemptions so that the United States could fund particular entities
within the PA. OFAC followed this strategy in 2006, announcing at
the time that “consistent with current foreign policy” it was
“authorizing U.S. persons to engage in certain transactions in which
the PA may have an interest.” Mirroring some of the exceptions listed
under PATA, OFAC exempted transactions with the Palestinian
judiciary, non-Hamas members of the Palestinian Legislative
Council, and various entities controlled by Abbas.

Although the United States sought to continue supporting non-Hamas
elements of the PA in 2006, it is doubtful that OFAC could repeat the
same tactic now, thanks to the relationship between Fatah and
Hamas. In 2006, Hamas campaigned against Fatah and tensions
between the two camps remained strong after the election. Armed
conflict broke out the following year despite the creation of a de facto
unity government, splintering the PA. Should the current
reconciliation agreement come to fruition, however, it would create a
joint power-sharing government. As a result, it may be more difficult
for OFAC to justify special exemptions on the grounds that certain
entities within the PA are insulated from Hamas; by all appearances,
they will be intertwined.

Swedish American Group Focuses On Cancer, Autoimmune Diseases At Life Science

Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.
Respected and acclaimed as rock stars in the arcane universe of life
sciences, global scientists converged in Stockholm in late August this
year for the annual Swedish American Life Science Summit (SALSS)
meeting, where they unveiled and dissected revolutionary health care
platforms. Among them are the use of robotics in surgery, how
nanotechnology may make us forever young,” applications of space
technology in life sciences, and the “Moonshot” cancer program
initiated by former Vice President Joseph Biden.
Without doubt, global investors are closely watching organizations
such as SALSS to discover the latest innovations and discoveries in life

science. This area is replete with groups deeply involved in original
research. So one of the major topics discussed at the SALSS conference
was “impact investing,” or why investors should pay closer attention to investing in life science.
“In today’s world with an aging population, we observe a higher occurrence of chronic diseases, such as cancer and
autoimmune conditions,” noted Hans Straberg, chairman of Atlas Copco, and former CEO of Electrolux. “So Big Pharma and
the industry are looking beyond the chemical and biologically derived molecules.” And as universities and small startups have
taken the lead in R&D investments, Big Pharma is very much dependent on collaborating with them, or acquiring their
technologies,” he argued.
Today Big Pharma has a “really strong position” in life sciences and are Looking for new blockbusters to replace current stars
that are coming off-patent, he said. The current focus, added Straberg, is “very much on finding cures for diseases like
cancer, autoimmunity, allergy and infection,” and employing various new technologies.
So new ideas to address a variety of serious medical issues have always attracted medical luminaries to SALSS, and at this
year’s conference, the speakers included Biden Cancer Initiative Executive Director Gregory Simon, Nobel Foundation
chairman Dr. Carl Henrik Heldin, European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries Director-General Richard Bergstrom,
and Microsoft Healthcare's chief development officer Mathias Ekman.
Also among the expert speakers were Pfizer executive vice president and chief of the company’s worldwide research
development Dr. Michael Dolsten, Secretary-General of the Royal Swedish Academy Life Sciences' Dr. Goran Hansson,
Google Healthcare and Cloud business manager Ebba Kraemer, China Kindstar Global Diagnostics CEO Shiang Huang,
AVRA Medical Robotics founder and CEO Alen York, expert in diabetes-related issues and CEO of Lyfebulb Dr. Karin
Hehenberger, and the founder and former chairman of Human Genome Sciences and currently chairman of ACCESS Health
International Dr. William A. Haseltine.

“Throughout the years, Swedish research and innovation have led the way to disruptive changes within medicine, which has
resulted in an immense impact on people’s lives and great value for society,” argued Dr. Goran K. Hansson, secretary general
of The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Today, “we see an increased interest of foreign capital in Swedish Life Science,
which the Swedish government embraces,” he said. Swedish Life Science players, he added, look for international expansion

One of main focus of this year’s SALSS conference was the Cancer Moonshot,” which is now known as the Biden Cancer
Initiative, represented by Gregory Simon, founder and executive director of The Biden Cancer Initiative. As part of this year’s

about space technology and how it stimulates creativity when applied to life sciences.

“Part of this year’s conference focus was the current transformation of the HealthTech industry, driven by the ICT and tech
players rather than by the traditional medtech companies,” said Barbro C. Ehnbom, chairman and founder of SALSS. Also
significant, she added, was the participation of numerous women at this year’s summit, led by the keynote speaker Dr. Bahija
Jallal, executive vice president at AsraZeneca and head of Medimmune. “ We are proud and glad that so many prominent
women are actually SALSS women, including Dr. Jallal, which made this 2017 summit more exceptional,” said Ms. Ehnbom.
One of the little known companies that attracted a lot of attention at the conference was AVRA Medical Robotics, a
development-stage company based in Orlando, Florida, that has a new generation of “semi-autonomous medical robots for
image-capture, navigation, and tissue targeting.”
Specifically, these “medical robots” perform computer-assisted surgery, with human medical surgeons operating a remote
surgical device via a console. In fact, they are not really robots as we know them: AVRA has developed a novel and truly
robotic single-arms platform for the field of aesthetics, skin and wound care as well as dermato-plastic surgery,” said Barry F.
Cohen, AVRA’s CEO and founder. The company’s first design integrates software, image guidance, navigation and targeting
systems, to allow autonomous needling of skin, he explained.
“The future of surgery will be determined by success in gaining precision access to anny area of the human body with the
smallest incisions and deploying therapies to specific tissues, glands and organs,” asserted Alen York, an AVRA senior
executive. Limitations in conventional surgeries, he said, are demanding more autonomous, intelligent robot systems that go
beyond the capability of a human being.” AVRA’S platform focused on needling technology represents a key breakthrough
in aesthetics, wound care, and autonomous drug delivery platforms, integration of artificial intelligence and augmented
reality that will allow,” says York, for a new paradigm in surgical training, planning and treatment.
SmartwiseSweden AB is another young biotech that presened at SALSS. It has developed what it calls the Extroducer, a micro
catheter for injecting cells, biologics and small molecule therapy directly into organs. The tiny diameter of the Extroducer,
with the width of a hair, enables the needle to penetrate the blood vessel wall and deliver a payload via the smallest blood
vessels in the body, making perviously inaccessible regions now available to direct tissue projection,” said Jonthan Clarke,
CEO of Smartwise. Its product is the first of its kind of versatile device that allows for direct local injection of substances into
multiple organs, such as the heart, pancreas, liver and kidney.
“We have shown successful and safe pre-clinical delivery of insulin producing cells into the pancreas and modified RNA to the
heart,” said Clarke, who admitted that he is in talks with multiple major pharmaceutical companies for licensing or other
agreements to advance production. Smartwise is still privately owned.
ProLung, a Salt Lake city-based biotechnology company focused singularly on improving lung cancer survival, has developed
a breakthrough test with precision volume-averaging “bioconductive technology to collect data to generate a personalized
score indicating the likelihood of malignancy. With an estimated one billion people at high-risk for lung cancer worldwide, it
has the lowest five-year survival rate, or 16%, of all major cancers, and is the leading cause of cancer death, said Steven C.
Eror, founder, president and CEO of ProLung. The copany's test is non-invasive and non-radiating that reduces the wait
time from months to just one day, he added.
The test has received a CE Mark and ISO 13485” manufacturing certificate and is approved for sale in the EEA and EFTA
countries, said Eror. In the U.S., the ProLung test is still for investigational use only and undergoing multi-site clinical trials
for FDA clearance as a “510(k) device,” he added.
Because the annual SALSS coference has attracted exerts worldwiude, it has become a central focus for life science companies
to present and exhibit their new products or novel technology to a growing number of medical and scientific experts looking
for the next breakthrough product in life sciences.

Peter
Thiel’s
Money
Talks,
in
Contentious
Ways.
But
What
Does
He
Say?
By DAVID STREITFELD MARCH 7, 2018
Peter Thiel is Silicon Valley’s homegrown Cassandra. He warned for years that the
big tech companies were arrogant and clueless and less good for mankind than
they believed.
Comeuppance, the billionaire investor warned, was coming.
Trouble has now arrived. Unfortunately for Mr. Thiel, the storm is centered on
Facebook, whose board he has been a member of practically since its founding. The
social network, which billed itself as bringing democracy and enlightenment to the
world, was used by the Russians to subvert democracy and sow confusion in the
United States.
Even people paid to see the future didn’t see that one coming.
“The board’s role is to help think about some of the medium- and longer-term
problems coming around the corner,” Mr. Thiel said. “We were far from perfect in
doing that.”
Mr. Thiel, 50, is at the center of nearly every issue that roils Silicon Valley,
ranging from the tech elite’s fascination with New Zealand hideaways (Mr. Thiel
obtained New Zealand citizenship) to Bitcoin (he is a major investor) to the
problems of herd thinking (he is moving from San Francisco to Los Angeles to
escape it) to the evolving role of content on the internet (he has been exploring the
creation of a media company that would outflank Breitbart and Fox for a younger
audience).
Two subjects are currently overwhelming everything else: President Trump,
whom Mr. Thiel aggressively backed for president, and Facebook, whose core
mission is being called into question in the wake of the Russian revelations. In a
typical Thiel move — he tends to run toward controversy even as his Silicon Valley
peers try to make themselves inconspicuous — he agreed, in a rare interview, to
talk about both.
“It’s been a crazier two years than I would have thought,” Mr. Thiel said in his new
Midtown Manhattan apartment, which is so far up in the clouds that it literally
looks down on Trump Tower.
Despite the proximity, the mutual enthusiasm between Mr. Thiel and Mr.
Trump seems to have cooled. After Mr. Thiel spoke at the Republican National
Convention in 2016, there were unsourced media reports that said Mr. Trump
wanted to put him on the Supreme Court. But now even photo ops are rare.
The investor said he had last spoken to the president “a few months ago.”
“We don’t talk that often,” he said, but added, “I can get access anytime I
want.”
The Trump whom Mr. Thiel touted at the Republican convention was a
candidate who would “end the era of stupid wars and rebuild our country,” move
us past “fake culture wars” and start projects the equivalent of the Apollo space
program. That does not seem to be the president he got.
“There are all these ways that things have fallen short,” Mr. Thiel said. But he
said he had no regrets about his endorsement. “It’s still better than Hillary Clinton
or the Republican zombies,” he said, referring to the other candidates.
The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Thiel is routinely labeled a libertarian. On a bookshelf in the apartment, as
if in confirmation, is a hardback copy of Ayn Rand’s “Atlas Shrugged,” the bible of
the movement. A gift, he said.
A lesser-known but possibly deeper influence was the French philosopher
René Girard, who taught at Stanford University when Mr. Thiel was an
undergraduate there. For 15 years, on and off, Mr. Thiel sat in on a study group
about Mr. Girard’s ideas. Mr. Girard believed human beings were deeply mimetic,
which is to say they copy one another.
“It’s very anti-Ayn Rand: There are no self-contained autonomous figures,”
Mr. Thiel said. “Our desires are not our own. They get shaped powerfully by the
society around us.”
It was this illumination that helped him see the potential of Facebook — where
people could find out in intimate and addictive detail what their friends were up to
— when it was barely a year old. He was the first outside investor, buying 10
percent of the company for $500,000.
He sold most of his holdings in 2012 as Facebook went public. A few months
ago, with Facebook’s market capitalization at about $500 billion, he sold most of
what he had left.
Last summer, there was a flap when a memo by a fellow board member, Reed
Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, appeared in The New York Times. In the
memo, Mr. Hastings wrote to Mr. Thiel that he displayed “catastrophically bad
judgment” in supporting Mr. Trump.
Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, did not ask him to step down
from the board, and reports that he wants to leave the board are incorrect, Mr.
Thiel said, noting that among other things that he brings “ideological diversity.” He
declined to say exactly how much or what kind of advice the Facebook board was
offering Mr. Zuckerberg, but defended the company from criticism that it was slow
to wake up to what the Russians did.
“Remember when Trump said the election was going to be rigged? People said
that was crazy — ‘How dare you question the integrity of the electoral process?’
That was the view of most of the people working at Facebook, too,” he said. “They
did not think things were so hackable. It was a mistake, but an understandable
mistake.” Facebook declined to comment.
The anger now being turned on Facebook, Mr. Thiel argued, is less about
Russia specifically and more about tech arrogance — its failure to do so much for
so many. It is a sentiment that helped put Mr. Trump in the White House.
“The Trump campaign slogan, ‘Make America Great Again,’ was perhaps the
single most offensive thing you could say to Silicon Valley,” he said. “Silicon Valley
says the future is going to be better than the past. That is the propaganda, if you
will.”
A friend of his in Silicon Valley had the idea of running for governor of
California this year. Mr. Thiel’s advice was that he had better have a good answer
to this question: Why is tech good for the average person in California? The
answer, he cautioned, couldn’t be a banality, such as “it’s making us more
connected,” and it couldn’t be utopian, such as “it’s going to cure all diseases.”
“He wasn’t able to come up with an answer, and I couldn’t come up with one,
either,” Mr. Thiel said. He declined to identify the friend, but it is well known in
tech circles that Sam Altman, the president of Y Combinator, the prominent startup
accelerator, was thinking about running. Mr. Altman confirmed it was him and
said he had decided not to run “for many reasons.”
There is a big painting of a cresting wave in Mr. Thiel’s living room, and it
might as well be a visual metaphor for what is going on in big tech now.
“Having some ambition that transcends just making money is a critical thing
for a company,” he said. “But there is some point where it gets crazy and selfdelusional.”
He added that the companies “are probably in some trouble — maybe
it’s a little, maybe it’s a lot.” The prospect of government regulation looms.
In 2015 and 2016, Mr. Thiel gave $300,000 to Josh Hawley, who was
campaigning to become Missouri’s attorney general. Mr. Hawley won, and in
November he opened an antitrust investigation of Google. A spokeswoman for Mr.
Hawley, a Republican who is now challenging the state’s Democratic senator,
Claire McCaskill, said there was “no connection” between Mr. Thiel’s donation and
the investigation. Google declined to comment.
The news last month that Mr. Thiel is moving from San Francisco to Los
Angeles reflects a shift that is as much mental as literal. Getting out of the tech
bubble, he figures, will give him more clarity about his investments.
“Network effects are very positive things, but there’s a tipping point where
they fall over into the madness of crowds,” he said.
Another of Mr. Thiel’s contentious ideas was destroying Gawker, the online
publisher. He secretly financed the privacy lawsuit that Hulk Hogan, the former
pro wrestler, filed against the media company, which Mr. Hogan won. That led to
Gawker’s bankruptcy in 2016.
A news operation that specialized in deflating the arrogance of Silicon Valley
should have been to Mr. Thiel’s liking. But he argues that his philosophy is
consistent here.
“Gawker was trying to cut people down to size for not conforming,” he said.
“The ability to speak and not have every word you say get distorted, to have wrong
ideas and then be able to correct them — these notions were powerfully undercut
by Gawker.”
Mr. Thiel is still pursuing the remnants of Gawker in court, which has
prompted accusations that he wants to remove all of its content from the internet
as a final victory.
He denied this. “Terry Bollea, a.k.a. Hulk Hogan, is still owed some money
from the Gawker sale, and that is what I am trying to get,” he said. “I don’t want
the archives. I don’t think it makes sense to destroy them. Preserve them, study
them instead.”

Stage Characteristics
Enlightened Ethics

e Reflexive cognitive basis

e Permeation of the categorical imperative and the quest
for coherence through inner as well as outer life

e Experientially grounded and logically supported rejection
of the illusion of moral certainty in favor of a case-specific
analytical and empathetic approach that embraces the
uncertainty of real social life

e Deep understanding of the illusory and biased nature of
the individual self, leading to humility regarding one’s
own ethical intuitions and prescriptions

e@ Openness to modifying one’s deepest, ethical (and other)
beliefs based on experience, reason and/or empathic com-
munion with others

e Adaptive, insightful approach to civil disobedience, con-
sidering laws and social customs in a broader ethical and
pragmatic context

e Broad compassion for and empathy with all sentient be
ings

e A recognition of inability to operate at this level at all
times in all things, and a vigilance about self-monitoring
for regressive behavior.

will enable us to tailor its environment and instructions more suitably than can be done in the
human case.

If an absolute guarantee of the ethical soundness of an AGI is what one is after, the line of
thinking proposed here is not at all useful. Experiential education is by its nature an uncertain
thing. One can strive to minimize the uncertainty, but it will still exist. Inspection of the
internals of an AGI’s mind is not a total solution to uncertainty minimization, because any
AGI capable of powerful general intelligence is going to have a complex internal state that
no external observer will be able to fully grasp, no matter how transparent the knowledge
representation.

However, if what one is after is a plausible, pragmatic path to architecting and educating
ethical AGI systems, we believe the ideas presented here constitute a sensible starting-point.
Certainly there is a great deal more to be learned and understood — the science and practice
of AGI ethics, like AGI itself, are at a formative stage at present. What is key, in our view, is
that as AGI technology develops, AGI ethics develops alongside and within it, in a thoroughly
coupled way.

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023401.txt,"In re: TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001., 2012 WL 257568 (2012)

Since the September 11th Attacks, the Security Council has continued to condemn international terrorism and the provision
of material support for terrorism and to assert that it poses a serious threat to peace and security. See, e.g., S.C. Res. 1373
(Sept. 28, 2001) (deciding that States shall “[p]revent and suppress the financing of terrorist acts,” and “[c]riminalize the
willful provision or collection, by any means, directly or indirectly, of funds by their nationals or in their territories with the
intention that the funds should be used, or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in order to carry out terrorist acts”); S.C.
Res. 1377 (Nov. 12, 2001) (declaring “that acts of international terrorism constitute one of the most serious threats to
international peace and security in the twenty-first century, ... that acts of international terrorism constitute a challenge to all
States and to all humanity”).

2. International conventions

The Security Council has defined international terrorism in accordance with the definition used in international treaties to
combat international terrorism. See, e.g., S/RES 156 (Oct. 8, 2004) (recalling that *127 acts “which constitute offenses within
the scope of and as defined in the international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism, are under no circumstances
justifiable ... and calls upon all States to ... ensure that such acts are punished”). One of the principal treaties to combat
international terrorism is the 1999 Financing Terrorism Convention. Article 2.1 of that Convention states:

Any person commits an offence within the meaning of this Convention if that person by any means,
directly or indirectly, unlawfully and willfully, provides or collects funds with the intention that they
should be used, in full or in part, in order to carry out: (a) An act which constitutes an offence within the
scope of and as defined in one of the treaties listed in the annex;' or (b) Any other act intended to cause
death or serious bodily injury to a civilian, or to any other person not taking an active part in the
hostilities in a situation of armed conflict, when the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to
intimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain
from doing any act.

International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (Dec. 9, 1999) (1999 Financing Terrorism
Convention), 2178 U.N.T.S. 197. The 1999 Financing Terrorism Convention was signed by at least 39 nations *128 before
September 11, 2011, entered into force on April 10, 2002, and now has 132 signatories and 174 parties. See United States v.
Bahlul, No. 09-001, 2011 U.S. CMCR LEXIS 3, at *126-27 (CMCR Sept. 9, 2011).

Most of the regional and multilateral conventions regarding terrorism employ a similar definition. See Interlocutory Decision
on the Applicable Law: Terrorism, Conspiracy, Homicide, Perpetration, Cumulative Charges (Applicable Law for Special
Tribunal for Lebanon), 50 I.L.M. 513, 536 (Spec. Trib. For Leb. July 2011) (discussing conventions). In addition, “all of
these conventions require--through the definition of the actus reus (the material element of a crime) or by additional
provisions--a transnational element to the crime.” Id. These international treaties and conventions support the conclusion that
“conduct in support of terrorism [is] internationally condemned and criminal.” United States v. Hamdan, 801 F. Supp. 2d
1247, 1284 (CMCR 2011).

3. Domestic laws of nations

Countries throughout the world have adopted a similar definition of terrorism in their domestic law (although in some cases
the domestic definition is broader than the definition in the international conventions because it does not include the
transnational element). See, e.g., Applicable *129 Law for Special Tribunal for Lebanon, 50 I.L.M. at *537-39; Bahlul, 2011
U.S. CMCR Lexis 3, at *138-148. For these reasons, at least one international court has found that there is a general opinion
and practice such that international terrorism is a violation of customary international law. See Applicable Law for Special
Tribunal for Lebanon, 50 1.L.M. at *535; Hamdan, 801 F. Supp. 2d at 1288-92.

of accountability. They call into question the true independence
of the boards of Korean conglomerates and the ability of outside
directors to effectively oversee management and protect all
shareholders’ interests.

Recent research on Korean-listed companies shows strong
social ties between independent directors and management of
Korean conglomerates. While 87% of boards are in theory
independent, only 62% are when one considers social ties.* The
composition of Korean boards also poses concern as the
percentage of directors with business or management
backgrounds has decreased from 45.2% in 2004 to 28.4% in
2011.° This, while the number of former public officials has
sharply increased from 2.7% in 2004 to 8.9% in 2011.
Interestingly, in Korea's boardrooms, the inclusion of professors
and lawyers as independent directors has become common. The
need for stronger
independent oversight
and monitoring of
management is especially
important for Korean
chaebols as they
concentrate the
managerial power into
the board’s chairman, a
member of the founding
family. The chairman’s
control over all
subsidiaries of the
conglomerate through
the management council and appointment of management of
all affiliated firms has been a serious concern for minority
shareholders seeking more accountability and managerial
transparency.

Protecting Shareholder Interests

At the core of Korea’s governance challenges lies a structural
problem at the chaebol: the complex system of cross-
shareholdings. On average, the founding family of Korean
conglomerates owns about 10% of the parent company’s shares,
while other listed subsidiaries own more than 30%.!° The
founding family is a shareholder in the other chaebol
subsidiaries, and the subsidiaries reciprocate by owning shares
in the other companies. The circular ownership structure has
been of investor concern as it provides a framework for related
party transactions and potential conflict between family
shareholders and external shareholders. For many, these
concerns have been factored into what has been called for over
a decade the “Korean discount.”

With the promise of sweeping governance reform by the new
President Moon Jae-In, foreign investors are looking today for
better protection of minority shareholder rights and stronger
constraints on chaebol businesses. On the politico-economic
reform agenda are topics such as: 1) reforming the Korean
Commercial Code by mandating separate elections for audit

“With the adoption of a Stewardship Code,
our expectations are that shareholders in
Korean equities, and especially in chaebols,
will use their voice more actively to
promote positive governance change and
long-term shareholder value creation.”

committee members, 2) allowing shareholders of parent
companies to sue directors of subsidiary firms, 3) lowering
eligibility thresholds for filing representative lawsuits, 4)
regulating compensation for controlling shareholders and
management, as well as 5) introducing mandatory electronic
and cumulative voting.!!

One of the most ambitious goals includes proposed amendments
to Korea’s Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act, introducing
constraints on chaebol businesses and banning all existing
circular ownership structures of chaebols within three years.”

The calls for big governance reform in Korea were first publicly
voiced by chaebols’ shareholders themselves. In 2015, at
Hyundai Motor’s annual general meeting, shareholders openly
confronted management about the controversial land deal and
proposed a new governance committee to strengthen oversight
and accountability. In an unprecedented fashion, their
shareholder action
prompted the company
to set up a separate
Corporate Governance
and Communication
Committee consisting
of four independent
directors, and to engage
in shareholder outreach.
In 2016, Hyundai Motor
officially announced its
new “Corporate
Governance Charter” in
an effort to enhance
transparent business management and to promote shareholder
rights.!° Similarly, in November 2016, Samsung announced a
“Comprehensive Roadmap to Enhance Long-term Shareholder
Value Creation,” committing to improve governance by
increasing its board’s independence, as well as the diversity and
breadth of experience of its directors.

Changing Korea’s Business Culture

The expected governance reform in Korea is an opportunity not
only to disentangle politics from business, but also to create
better institutional protection for all shareholders. It also serves
as an opportunity to change the culture of investing in the
country.

In February, Korea's Financial Services Commission introduced
the country’s first Stewardship Code, encouraging big investors
like pension plans and asset managers to actively engage with
investee companies and to monitor their management decisions.
This trend towards investor stewardship and active ownership
echoes the progress already made in other Asian markets such
as Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and
Thailand. With the adoption of a Stewardship Code, our
expectations are that shareholders in Korean equities, and
especially in chaebols, will use their voice more actively to
promote positive governance change and long-term shareholder
value creation. @

services of the world. In the United States, Xinhua doubled the number of bureaus,
adding Chicago, Houston, and San Francisco to its original footprint in Washington,
DC, New York, and Los Angeles. Xinhua, like other state-owned Chinese media outlets,

also began hiring local talent, and in 2009 it began a TV broadcast in English.

As part of this vigorous propaganda campaign, the Party has sought to turn China
Central Television into a global competitor to CNN. CCTV was already airing in
America as of 2004, when it cooperated with EchoStar, America’s second-largest
satellite TV company, to launch the Chinese “Great Wall Platform” package, including
twelve Mandarin channels, two Cantonese channels, one Hokkien channel, and one
English channel. That same year, Rupert Murdoch’s News Group helped CCTV place
programming on Time Warner and NewsCorp’s US television network. CCTV also
expanded its offerings in the United States, growing its bureau in Washington and
hiring American reporters too. By 2012, CCTV, recently renamed the China Global
Television Network (CGTN), was broadcasting in seven languages. Its programs

for American audiences regularly feature personalities from Russia’s state-funded
propaganda outlet, RT, which was recently required to register as a foreign agent; RT,

in turn, regularly features CGTN personalities.

China Radio International (CRI) was also given a foreign platform. Decades ago, the
Beijing-based propaganda outlet relied solely on shortwave broadcasts to beam China’s
message to the world, but in the late 2000s it began leasing local stations around the
globe and across the United States that it supplied with content made in Beijing. CRI
has used a US-based company through which it leases stations. That firm is EDI Media
Inc. (s2S48 8 IR 5]), which also owns other media properties that tow Beijing’s line:
G&E TV GRR), GE Studio Network GRIF BA), and EDI City Newsweek
(703 BTFI).1° A CRI subsidiary in China, Guoguang Century Media, holds a majority
stake in G&E Studio.' When it comes to reporting on mainland China, the content of

all of EDI’s outlets mirrors that of China’s state-owned media.

China’s state-run media have proved to be nimble in accomplishing Beijing’s goal of
penetrating US markets. In 2013, the Hong Kong—based Phoenix Satellite TV group,
which has close ties to the Chinese state and broadcasts in China, attempted to
purchase two major FM stations in Los Angeles that shared the same frequency. One of
them, KDAY, covers West L.A., while KDEY stretches into Riverside and San Bernardino
counties to the east of the city. Greater Los Angeles is home to more than a half million

Chinese, the second-biggest concentration next to New York City. But none of the

BILL SIEGEL

FrontPage Interview’s guest today is Bill Siegel, a lawyer and business
executive. He has been a producer of several documentary films and assists numerous non-profit
organizations. He is the author of The Control Factor: Our Struggle to See the True Threat.

FP: Bill Siegel, welcome to FrontPage Interview.
Congratulations on this brilliant book. It is without question one of the most vital works of our time.
Let’s begin with what inspired you to write it.

Siegel: Thanks for having me Jamie. As a young boy born in the mid 1950s, I was fascinated with footage of
Hitler and the Third Reich and could never understand how the Jews of the time could not see the evil that
seemed so obvious. Not yet appreciative of the benefit of hindsight, I could not comprehend the blindness.
Following 9/11, like so many others, I began to study Islam, its history, its current movements, terrorism and
so on. As I would learn one stunning aspect after another, I would discuss them with friends and associates.
Rather than confront the facts I would present, they would find one clever way after another to avoid the
frightening truth of what America and the West truly face. Their fear appeared obvious to me. I began to
catalog many of my friends’ different maneuvers to dispel the anxiety that they found so difficult to endure.
The more I focused on their mental processes (as well as my own) the more I began to see a structure to the
mental endeavor and to understand what I had, as a child, found so difficult to explain.

FP: Tell us about the Control Factor, what you describe as “that effort our minds enga ge in in order to keep
us blind” and that “process of a voiding seeing the threats we face.” It’s also about, as you state, trying to
believe that the threat is under our control, when in fact it is not. Kindly enlighten us as to these profound
insights you make in terms of the Control Factor.

Siegel: First, let’s distinguish the ”real world” where real battles are taking place from the mental battlefield
which occurs in each of our minds. We tend to believe our perceptions are simply clear realizations of what is
“out there” and overlook how much our internal worlds can literally determine what we see. When our
internal minds become anxious and sense a loss of “control,” they tend to concoct ways to distort our
perceptions so as to restore that sense of inner control. I describe the Control Factor as an “active and
continuous process” designed to maintain that sense, if not illusion, of control. We natural ly think that our
thinking and feeling processes are passive; that they just happen. Yet when faced with truly frightening
prospects, the mind is geared to actively distort.

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025035.txt,"The key to the Inner Jihad is to learn to transfer responsibility for our Islamic Enemy’s hate and resultant
actions back to it and take responsibility back for our own situation. We must learn all we can about the
enemy. We must unwind our inappropriate projections and introjections and rediscover who we are and are
not. We must speak up. We must support those Muslims who promote expressions of Islam that are
consistent with our principles. And we must stalk the C ontrol Factor, constantly be on guard for its
intrusion. This is an individual endeavor as each of our Control Factors uses its own methods. The book
gives plenty of examples of each maneuver discussed but it is important for each of us to discover the
unique workings of his own mind. That takes the work of the Inner Jihad.

FP: Share with our readers what you mean by the “Turnaround Moment.”

Siegel: There is a moment in typical horror films where the central characters have been pushed to their
limit. They then change and fully embrace the willingness to be as ruthless as the threat they face. No more
moral high ground; no more futile attempts to ignore or change the threat’s essence. As Lee Harris
described in The Suicide of Reason, it is the willingness o r license to be (not necessarily actually being) as
ruthless that is critical. It is a mental state that sheds all the prior counter-productive efforts at denial to
finally clearly focus on the threat faced. Part of the Inner Jihad is to reach that Turnaround Moment sooner
rather than later.

FP: You suggest that “mirroring” should be used as part of our arsenal. Tell us about it.

Siegel: Mirroring is a literal approach to transferring back to the addict responsibility that we have been
inappropriately accepting. Critical to the addict/enabler relationship is asymmetry. Like the addict, the
enemy uses a less limiting set of rules than we do. The enemy typically initiates aggression while we
respond only. Mirroring means that we demonstrate our willingness to act symmetrically, to be governed by
the same rules. It is stunning how much is accomplished when one’s attitude simply is clear that he will do
what is necessary; often not much else is needed as the addict or enemy realizes the game is fundamentally
changed. But other times action is absolutely needed. Demonstrating that we are not afraid to treat the
enemy as it treats us carries great meaning. Imagine (international law aside) if Israel announced that from
now on it will mirror Hamas such that if civilian populations are targeted by bombs from Gaza, Israel will
do the same (it is accused of such anyway). The population might finally rethink and take responsibility for
its privilege of voting its leaders. As stated earlier, all behavior is instructive and when we mirror we teach
the other the effects of his behavior.

Conversely, some situations demand that we assert asymmetry; those cases where it is necessary to
highlight our differences with the enemy. Just this week, an disingenuous report was issued by an NGO
drawing an equivalence between Palestinian and Israe li schoolbooks claiming that both sides have their
relativistic “ narratives.” Yet, as the Palestinian Media Watch’s website has demonstrated for years, there is
nothing in the West anywhere comparable to the hatred spewed daily by the Palestinian Authority,
including through its education system. It is interesting to note that while the US State Department initially
funded the “study,”- in what appears to be an attempt to sanitize the PA’s record so that the US can
continue to fund the PA against the spirit of US law- Hillary Clinton has a difficult time escaping her
conclusion as Senator in 2007 that these schoolbooks along with other media “profoundly poison(s) the
minds of these children.” It is most important that we do not succumb to this type of use of symmetry that
distorts the profound differences between us and the enemy.

Essentially, we are not clear as a nation, participating in a world with international rules, how to bes t fight
this enemy. The first act of any rehab is to acknowledge that we do not know how nor are we yet competent
to stop our addictions. This is not a book about policy. In fact, the “right” policies are unlikely to emerge
until a critical mass has meaningfully dealt with their Control Factors and share a common perspective. We
like to look at our history and assume a single perspective throughout but the truth is that we had to learn
how to respond to Pearl Harbor, the Nazis, the Cold War etc. The same applies here. Our press promotes
“elites” who are tasked with acting as if they possess the “true wisdom” to deal with our threats but the truth
is we do not know nor are we equipped to marshal enough of our population to agree just yet. The sooner
we learn, however, the less we will suffer. Mirroring has always been a key component of those lessons.

New Smart GPS Shoes

Manisha Kanetkar - Thursday, 1 February 2007

Keeping track of your loved ones has never been so easy (or so spy-like) with the new Xplorer
smart GPS shoes designed by GTXC.

The company boasts the shoes incorporate the smallest, most powerful and robust GPS tracking
device currently available. GTXC says they are ideal for caretakers of children or the elderly to
easily monitor the location of their charges.

So, for example, they can preset perimeters of safe zones or unsafe zones, and then receive mobile
phone alerts if a perimeter is breached by the wearer. This is handled by what the company calls

its ‘set-it-and-forget-it' Dual GeoFencing feature.

the new administration’s policies remain uncertain,
a moderate-sized stimulus package of around
$200 billion per year seems likely.!°? While the
direct impact of such a package is estimated to
boost GDP growth by only 0.3 percentage point
in 2017, the positive indirect impact of tax cuts
and stronger anticipated GDP on household and
business confidence is arguably more important.
Indeed, both consumer and CFO confidence have
recently hit their highest readings in over a decade
(see Exhibit 39).

Our View on US Growth

As the expansion enters its eighth year, it is natural
to question its durability. But far from showing

its age, the US economy begins 2017 at an above-
trend growth pace, with little evidence of cyclical
imbalances or other excesses that typically portend
the end of the business cycle. If anything, the slow
pace of this recovery has elongated its life span, a
dynamic that is likely to persist this year. Perhaps
in macroeconomics, as in life, age is just a number.

Eurozone: Weathering the Storm
The Eurozone has faced its share of challenges in

recent years. Not only did it relapse into recession
in 2011, but it also endured a domestic sovereign

bond and banking crisis at the same time. More
recently, it has been buffeted by a spate of tragic
terrorist attacks, an immigration crisis, the Brexit
vote, a failed Italian constitutional referendum
and renewed concerns about the solvency of its
banking system.

Yet despite this onslaught of headwinds, the
real economy has been remarkably stable in the
last two years. That fact is evident in Exhibit 40,
which shows real GDP growth has sustained an
above-trend pace over this period, an outcome
that clearly exceeded consensus forecasts. Business
sentiment has remained equally steadfast over this
period, suggesting that the rapidity of shocks may
have effectively inured confidence to bad news (see
Exhibit 41). Meanwhile, real household disposable
income grew by 2.3% over the past year—the
fastest pace since 2007.

We expect this stability to persist in 2017,
with our forecast calling for 1.2-1.9% real GDP
growth. Keep in mind that there is ample scope
for above-trend growth to continue, as the level
of Eurozone GDP still stands below its potential.
On this point, the OECD, IMF and European
Commission each currently estimate an output gap
of around 2%, indicating slack in the economy.
The Eurozone’s still elevated 9.8% unemployment
rate corroborates this point.

organize events and contact voters during the campaign. We outfitted our own war
room in an open-plan floor of offices on the edge of Tel Aviv. Philip called it
“Milbank South.” As organizational head of the campaign, I chose Chagai Shalom.
An industrial engineer by training, he was a reserve army general who, when I was
chief of staff, had been in charge of the logistics branch of the military. I gave him
Sayeret Matkal backup as well, in the person of Danny Yatom, my longtime friend
and former sayeret deputy.

But all that was process. Winning or losing would come down to how our
message, our ability to forge alliances, and my own personal and political appeal,
measured up against Bibi.

The new system of separate elections for party and Prime Minister meant that in
order to win a majority, I would need the support of voters outside Labor as well. I
set out to establish a broader movement, a big tent under which a majority of
Israelis could coexist politically. I realized this risked provoking anger among
some Labor activists. But I wanted to convey to voters that I was reaching out
beyond my core party constituency: to “soft” right-wingers nearer the political
center; to the Sephardim who since 1977 had overwhelmingly voted Likud; to the
growing number of Russian immigrants who had helped Bibi defeat Peres; and to
those among the Orthodox who still subscribed to tolerance and moderation in the
mold of the old-style National Religious Party in the first few decades of the state.
Though the candidates on our Knesset election list would all be from Labor, I ran
the Prime Ministerial campaign under the broader banner of Yisrael Ahat — One
Israel. I envisaged it as an alliance of at least several different parties with Labor at
its center.

I began with Bibi’s jettisoned Foreign Minister, David Levy. He was a
Moroccan-born 1950s immigrant whose career had begun at the grassroots, in the
northern town of Beit She’an, but who went on to become a key part of Begin’s
victory in 1977. The leading Sephardi figure in the Likud, he was at one point
mentioned as a future leader. Many Israelis, especially on the left, now portrayed
him as a figure of ridicule. But I'd always had a higher opinion of him. During the

the end of the year, Trump was casually mocking his chief of staff and
his penchant for efficiency and strict procedures. Indeed, both men were
openly trashing each other, quite unmindful of the large audience for
their slurs. For Trump, Kelly was a “twitcher” and “feeble” and ready to
“stroke out.” For Kelly, Trump was “deranged” and “mad” and “stupid”

The drama just got weirder.

In February, Kelly, a retired four-star general, grabbed Trump adviser
Corey Lewandowski outside the Oval Office and pushed him up against a
wall. “Don’t look him in the eye” whispered Trump about Kelly after the
incident, circling his finger next to his head in the crazy sign. The con-
frontation left everybody shaken, with Trump asking Lewandowski not
to tell anyone, and Lewandowski, when talking to the people he did tell,
saying that he had almost wet himself.

By March, Trump and Kelly were hardly speaking. Trump ignored
him; Kelly sulked. Or Trump would drop pointed hints that Kelly should
resign, and Kelly would ignore him. Everyone assumed the countdown
had begun.

Various Republicans, from Ryan to McConnell to their right-wing
adversary Mark Meadows, along with Bannon, had gotten behind a plan
to push House majority leader Kevin McCarthy for chief of staff. Even
Meadows, who hated McCarthy, was all for it. Here finally was a strat-
egy: McCarthy, a top tactician, would refocus an unfocused White House
on one mission—the midterms. Every tweet, every speech, every action
would be directed toward salvaging the Republican majority.

Alas, Trump didn’t want a chief of staff who would focus him. Trump,
it was clear, didn’t want a chief of staff who would tell him anything.
Trump did not want a White House that ran by any method other than to
satisfy his desires. Someone happened to mention that John E Kennedy
didn’t have a chief of staff, and now Trump regularly repeated this presi-
dential factoid.

+e

The Mueller team, as it pursued the Russia investigation, continued to
bump up against Trump’s unholy financial history, exactly the rabbit hole

SIEGE 31

Trump had warned them not to go down. Mueller, careful to protect mt
own flank, took pains to reassure the president's lawyers that he wasn’t
pursuing the president's business interests; at the same time, he was pase
ing the evidence his investigation had gathered about Trump’s business
and personal affairs to other federal prosecutors. .

On April 9, the FBI, on instructions from federal prosecutors in New
York, raided the home and office of Michael Cohen, as well as a room he
was using in the Regency Hotel on Park Avenue. Cohen, who billed him-
self as Trump’s personal lawyer, sat handcuffed for hours in his kitchen
while the FBI conducted its search, itemizing and hauling away every
electronic device its agents could find,

Bannon, coincidentally, also stayed at the Regency on his frequent
trips to New York, and he would sometimes bump into Cohen in the
hotel’s lobby. Bannon had known Cohen during the campaign, and the
lawyer's mysterious involvement in campaign issues often worried him.
Now, in Washington, seeing the Cohen news, Bannon knew that another
crucial domino had fallen.

“While we don’t know where the end is,” said Bannon, “we can guess
where it might begin: with Brother Cohen”

+

On April 11, three weeks after the president signed the budget bill, Paul
Ryan—one of the government's most powerful figures given the red
lican lock on Washington—announced his plan to leave the Speakership
and depart Congress.

“Listen to what Paul Ryan is saying,” said Bannon, sitting at his table
in the Embassy early that morning. “It’s over. Done. Done. And Paul Ryan
wants the fuck off the Trump train today:”

Ryan had been telling almost anyone who would listen that as id
as fifty or sixty House seats would be lost seven months hence in the mid-
term elections. A Ryan lieutenant, Steve Stivers, chairman of the National
Republican Congressional Committee, was estimating a loss of ninety to
one hundred seats. At this gloomy hour, it seemed more than possible
that the Democrats would eliminate their twenty-three-seat deficit and

basin, then the attractor itself is a point at the bowl’s very bottom. Changing the
value of some influential parameter may induce the sudden formation of a small hill,
growing at the center of the basin’s bottom. Now fluid flow in the attractor bowl runs
down to a path around the hill at its bottom. The autonomous motion of the fluid
flows takes place now in a circular orbit. The basin of the new attractor is the
original bowl minus the point at the top of the central hill. The fluid flow around the
hill at the bottom of the basin is circular and is called a limit cycle. Note that the
direction of the rotation of the limit cycle can circle in one direction or the other. |n
some computational simulations, motion alternates between directions. This
suggests the aspect of the born again amphetamine religions, splitting. There is an
unstable and intermixed probability of right versus left turning directions and their
alternation. This vulnerability to directional splitting and often unpredictable
alterations in action themes can represent what seem to be _ paradoxical
combinations of both good and evil in the same strongly faithful, for example, the
apparent bidirectional morality of generous and loving, pederast priests.

These mathematically flavored images of the sudden emergence of a limit
cycle in complex systems was made biologically concrete to me by research
conducted by one of my first graduate students, David Segal. He is now a professor
of psychiatry at the University of California in San Diego. His program of work
involved the administration of very gradually increasing doses of amphetamine to
rats while their behavior was being monitored and recorded by a continuously
running video camera. He documented the behavior of rats in a walled rectangular
space within which, without drugs, they first wandered about randomly and then
settled down to rest in an individually selected, favorite home corner. Segal called
all of these phenomena, patterns of exploratory behavior. At doses of amphetamine
below 2.5 milligrams (mg) per kilogram weight (kg), the exploration of the entire
bounded space proceeded faster than was the case with their salt-water treated
controls, their paths being more uniformly distributed throughout the box. They
spent less time resting in their home corner. At almost precisely 2.5 mg/kg, the rat’s

behavior changed dramatically into an entirely new pattern of continuous circling. As

I was merely feeling morning-after guilt. You were totally into it,” she informed me. She
was clearly smug with victory, but angry that I resisted her version of events. I felt
resentful for years.

I didn't even tell my partners about my orgasm difficulties until I'd known them for a
while, because my secret felt like such Restricted Information: I couldn't give it to anyone
I didn't trust. I couldn't abide the idea of everyone knowing how broken I felt. I couldn't
stand the combination of pity and fascination that my problem evoked in the few who
knew.

When I did get around to telling my partners, that was most complicated of all. I was
quite unpopular in high school, and so I was something of a late bloomer -- boyfriend-
free until my late teens. It took years before I had any confidence in my boyfriend
interactions. And because I had no idea how to come and no idea where to start and little
idea of how to communicate about sex, I could not give guidance about what I wanted.

I also felt paranoid that lovers would resent me if they felt I was demanding something
too difficult during the sexual exchange, so I downplayed my feelings. I told awful
lies like “it's not a big deal that I can't come -- lies that broke my heart as I spoke them,
but felt safer than the truth.

I did manage to have one orgasm in my teens -- one. I'm still not sure how it happened. It
occurred one evening when I was incredibly tired, but went out with friends to get a
fudge brownie sundae anyway. When I got back, my boyfriend came over and wanted to
have sex, and I let it happen -- despite being tired and uninterested and full of sundae --
because I had not yet internalized the notion that my boyfriends wouldn't hate me if I
denied them sex. I was barely present during the act, but I jolted into awareness when I
realized I was having an orgasm. Afterwards, exhaustion overwhelmed me and I fell
straight into sleep -- so deep that my boyfriend was unable to wake me.

This was puzzling and hard to analyze. What aspects of my singular orgasm should go
into my Unified Theory... and which aspects were irrelevant?

The chocolate? Well, chocolate is arguably a mild drug, and drugs help some people
come. Also, there were studies that found mild aphrodisiac qualities to chocolate. So
maybe.

The position? The position had felt really good but was somewhat awkward, and I felt
weird asking my boyfriend to reproduce it, so I didn't let myself think about the position.
(I'm much better at communicating with my partners now.)

What about the exhaustion? It made sense that being very tired might help me let go.
But I hadn't been very turned on or enjoyed the rest of the encounter, mostly because I
was so exhausted; and I didn't want to deliberately force myself to have sex while tired.
So while the exhaustion might have been a factor, I filed it under less-than-useful as
well.

I didn't worry about the problem too much for a while, because I figured that now that I'd
had one orgasm, surely it would become easy. I didn't tell my boyfriend it had happened,

ardent Orthodox Jewish Zionist, now 65 years old, was the leading vigilante of the
West Bank He planted bombs in the cars of Arab mayors and plotted to blow up the
Dome of the Rock. Buying up farmland from the Palestinians beginning in 1979,
many of whom were then killed by their own because they were seen as
collaborators, Zar and his group of young volunteer settlers took over harvesting the
Palestinian’s olive trees and shooting rifles over the heads of those that would take
them back. Fundamentalist Christians share his vision that the coming of the
Messiah, the second for Christians, the first for the Jews, is dependent upon the
complete return of all of the land of Israel to the Jews.

| recall that in the middle 1940’s, my father took me to a fund raising dinner
for the local chapter of the Jewish Antidefamation League. The whispered talk was
about blowing up a warehouse in which anti-Semitic pamphlets were stored,
planned for the middle of the night when it was unoccupied. Even at the age of 10, |
could tell that their quiet anger and firm commitment made these threatened men

nighttime property destruction when, the following year, my father explained the
reason for our being refused overnight rooms at several motels as we drove along I-
95 in Southeast Florida. It took us until late night to find a place to sleep. This was
America’s muted version of what Hitler and his legions were doing to Jews that, at
that time, was not generally known, except for Walter Winchell, in America.
Resonant with our chemical-cultural theme are the many reports that Hitler was
taking an amphetamine drug, Benzedrine, daily and in high doses for the last 20 or
more years of his life. One can hear the characteristic, amphetamine-induced,
higher pitched, rants in his recorded radio tirades. Compare the pitch and strained
voice quality of the singing of Bob Dylan in his early records made while he was on
speed with the gravely, much lower pitched voice, now that he is not. In our

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016376.txt,"The bottom-up method for recognizing handwritten characters is to give the
computer thousands of examples of each one and let it pull out the salient features.
Instead, Lake ef al. gave the program a general model of how you draw a character: A
stroke goes either right or left; after you finish one, you start another; and so on. When
the program saw a particular character, it could infer the sequence of strokes that were
most likely to have led to it—just as I inferred that the spam process led to my dubious
email. Then it could judge whether a new character was likely to result from that
sequence or from a different one, and it could produce a similar set of strokes itself. The
program worked much better than a deep-learning program applied to exactly the same
data, and it closely mirrored the performance of human beings.

These two approaches to machine learning have complementary strengths and
weaknesses. In the bottom-up approach, the program doesn’t need much knowledge to
begin with, but it needs a great deal of data, and it can generalize only in a limited way.
In the top-down approach, the program can learn from just a few examples and make
much broader and more varied generalizations, but you need to build much more into it to
begin with. A number of investigators are currently trying to combine the two
approaches, using deep learning to implement Bayesian inference.

The recent success of AI 1s partly the result of extensions of those old ideas. But
it has more to do with the fact that, thanks to the Internet, we have much more data, and
thanks to Moore’s Law we have much more computational power to apply to that data.
Moreover, an unappreciated fact is that the data we do have has already been sorted and
processed by human beings. The cat pictures posted to the Web are canonical cat
pictures—pictures that humans have already chosen as “good” pictures. Google
Translate works because it takes advantage of millions of human translations and
generalizes them to a new piece of text, rather than genuinely understanding the
sentences themselves.

But the truly remarkable thing about human children is that they somehow
combine the best features of each approach and then go way beyond them. Over the past
fifteen years, developmentalists have been exploring the way children learn structure
from data. Four-year-olds can learn by taking just one or two examples of data, as a top-
down system does, and generalizing to very different concepts. But they can also learn
new concepts and models from the data itself, as a bottom-up system does.

For example, in our lab we give young children a “blicket detector”’—a new
machine to figure out, one they’ve never seen before. It’s a box that lights up and plays
music when you put certain objects on it but not others. We give children just one or two
examples of how the machine works, showing them that, say, two red blocks make it go,
while a green-and-yellow combination doesn’t. Even eighteen-month-olds immediately
figure out the general principle that the two objects have to be the same to make it go,
and they generalize that principle to new examples: For instance, they will choose two
objects that have the same shape to make the machine work. In other experiments, we’ve
shown that children can even figure out that some hidden invisible property makes the
machine go, or that the machine works on some abstract logical principle.**

supposed to love all facials all the time, to which I say: Bah. I'm occasionally into
degradation scenes, and facials feel really degrading to me, so there are circumstances in
which a guy can come on my face and it'll be hot -- but those circumstances are rare. I've
got to really respect him and really trust him, and I've got to be really turned on and
excited about whatever scene we're playing out. And if a guy were to give me a facial
without clearing it with me at some point ahead of time? Serious boundary violation. Not
cool.

Have I destroyed your image of me as your sex-crazy nympho dreamgirl? Good.

I think that people of all genders receive a lot of unconscious training about how we can
damage ourselves in exchange for the attention of the opposite sex. By writing about my
own experience, I don't mean to discount the experiences of others. I get that many guys
feel locked into acting confident and dominant, and that lots of guys hate that role as
much as I hate my Sexy Dreamgirl Shell. I get that many women genuinely enjoy
reclaiming the Sexy Dreamgirl image, and making it their own; hell, I do it myself
sometimes. (Yes, I do it myself sometimes. Sex is complicated.)

People of all genders have a hard time figuring out what turns them on. Authenticity is
hard -- and sexual authenticity gets harder when you're feeling low, or you really like
someone and really want that person to like you, or when you feel bombarded with
messages about how you've got to compete in a harsh sexual marketplace. I believe
that one of the best ways to authenticity is to seek understanding of the pressures on
everyone, and to grasp that everyone's got their own nightmare of the Sexy Dreamgirl
Shell.

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023373.txt,"In re: TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001., 2012 WL 257568 (2012)

On September 11, 2001, members of the al-Qaeda’ terrorist organization hijacked four commercial airliners and used those
planes as weapons in a coordinated attack on the United States (“the September 11th Attacks”). The September 11th Attacks
were the culmination of a campaign to wage jihad against the United States, set in motion with the formation of al-Qaeda in
1988 and made possible by the massive financial, logistic, and material support provided to al-Qaeda by its collaborators and
*9 sympathizers over a period of many years. That support allowed al-Qaeda to build the global infrastructure necessary to
plan and conduct the September 11th Attacks.

Through their suits, plaintiffs seek to hold accountable the states, purported charities, banks, organizations and individuals
who knowingly provided material support or resources to al-Qaeda, thereby making the September 11th Attacks possible.
Plaintiffs’ complaints assert claims under the Anti-Terrorism Act, Alien Tort Statute, Torture Victim Protection Act, and
common law theories of concerted action liability. Plaintiffs initiated their respective actions between August 15, 2002 and
September 2, 2004.

In presenting their substantive claims and theories of jurisdiction against the defendants, and in responding to the various
motions to dismiss, plaintiffs offered detailed factual allegations in their respective complaints concerning the origins of
al-Qaeda, the vast infrastructure that fueled that organization’s growth and development, and al-Qaeda’s systematic and
public targeting of the United States and its citizens beginning in 1988. JA3775-78.4 Within this broader framework, the *10
pleadings described the particular character of the defendants’ collaboration with al-Qaeda, and the nature of the material
support and resources they provided to al-Qaeda in furtherance of its jihad against the United States. JA3602-3728,
3778-3876.

Plaintiffs in virtually all cases later filed one or more amended complaints, and numerous RICO Statements and/or More
Definite Statements as to individual defendants, which served to amend their respective complaints.’ Those supplemental
pleadings offered additional details concerning the individual defendants’ roles in supporting al-Qaeda, based largely on the
flow of new evidence and information uncovered as a result of the intensive investigations initiated following the September
11th Attacks concerning the sources of al-Qaeda’s vast financial and logistical support.

On December 9, 2003, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order transferring the Burnett action from the
District of Columbia to the Southern District of New York and consolidating all then-indicated, citations to the record refer to
the docket numbers on the MDL 1570 docket sheet. *11 pending cases against al-Qaeda’s material sponsors and supporters
arising from the September 11th Attacks. The September 11th MDL was assigned to Judge Richard Casey, who presided
over the consolidated proceedings until his death on March 22, 2007. On April 20, 2007, the September 11th MDL was
re-assigned to Judge George Daniels, who has since presided over the trial court proceedings.

Between 2002 and 2005, approximately 100 defendants entered appearances in the cases comprising the September 11th
MDL and, with one exception, moved to dismiss the claims against them. In general terms, the defendants’ motions sought
dismissal principally under one or more of the following theories: (1) lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA); (2) lack of personal jurisdiction; and/or (3) failure to state a claim.

In response to defendants’ motions seeking dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction and/or subject matter jurisdiction and
under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), plaintiffs supplemented their already detailed allegations record
relevant to those jurisdictional disputes through extrinsic information and evidence filed in support of their oppositions to the
Defendants’ motions to dismiss. These materials *12 included, inter alia, governmental and intelligence reports, documents
released in response to Defendants’ Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, U.S. filings in criminal trials,
Congressional testimony, analyses authored by counterterrorism experts and think tanks, Treasury Department statements
concerning designations of terror sponsors and supporters pursuant to Executive Order 13224, as well as relevant public
reporting.

some reports, this has led to Iranian anger and a cessation of the flow
of funds to the Hamas enclave in Gaza.

These setbacks do not mean the end of Iran and its allies as a regional
power bloc. Assad has not yet fallen. The Iranian nuclear programme
is proceeding apace. Tehran's Hezbollah client is in effective control
of Lebanon. But it does mean that in future the Iranian appeal is
likely to be more decisively limited to areas of Shia population.

The less good news, from Israel's point of view, is that the new forces
on the rise in the region consist largely of one or another variant of
Sunni Islamism. AKP-led Turkey has emerged as a key facilitator of
the Syrian opposition, in which Sunni Islamist elements play a
prominent role. Turkey appears to be in the process of making a bid
for the regional leadership also sought by Iran. In Egypt, too, the
Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist forces look set to reap an
electoral dividend in November. The Sinai area has already become a
zone of activity for Islamist terror directed against Israel, because of
the breakdown in law and order in recent months. The attacks on the
pipeline bringing Egyptian gas to Israel, and the recent terror attack
in Eilat, are testimony to this. So while the Shia crescent may have
suffered a strategic setback as a result of the upheavals in the Arab
world, the space left by the fall of regional leaders looks to be filled
largely by new, Sunni Islamist forces. Israel remains capable of
defending itself against a strategic threat posed by any constellation
of these elements. But the current flux in the region is likely to
produce a more volatile, complex Middle East, consisting of an Iran-
led camp and perhaps a number of Sunni competitors, rather than the
two-bloc contest of pro-US and pro-Iranian elements which preceded
2011.

Quarters After Recession Trough

Data as of December 2016.
Source: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg, National Bureau of Economic Research.

In our 2016 Outlook and our 2016 Insight report,
Walled In: China’s Great Dilemma, we stated that
China was unlikely to have a hard landing over the
next two years (i.e., 2016 and 2017). We believe
the view still holds. We do not expect a hard
landing in China that would destabilize the US
economy in 2017, but the risks grow significantly
in 2018 and 2019. As we discuss below, China may
nevertheless represent a geopolitical risk in 2017.
Historically, since WWII, the odds of a
recession occurring over a 12-month period
have been 18%. Our composite recession model,
incorporating end-of-year financial and economic
data, estimates the probability of a recession in
2017 at 23%. Once we incorporate the likely
passage of a fiscal stimulus package of tax cuts
and infrastructure investments in the latter half
of 2017, the probability of a recession this year
declines to about 15%.

Rising Influence of Populist Parties in

the Eurozone

Since the election of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras
and the Syriza Party in Greece in January 2015,
populism has been gaining momentum across
Europe. The support for populist parties has
increased to varying degrees in Spain, Greece, Italy,
France, the Netherlands, Germany and Austria.
The common themes among populists have been
anti-immigration and anti-European Union.
Outside the Eurozone, the 2016 Brexit vote in
Great Britain has been interpreted as a populist

vote against immigration from Eastern Europe, the
Middle East and North Africa, as well as against
the bureaucracy of the European Union.

The increasing enthusiasm for populist parties
in Europe raises two questions. First, will any of
the more extremist parties win enough support to
break away from the European Union? In France,
for example, upcoming elections in May 2017 are
likely to pit Francois Fillon of Les Républicains
against Marine Le Pen of the far right Front
National. Le Pen has promised a referendum on
whether France should stay in the European Union,
and, should she win, questions about the viability
of the Eurozone will surface immediately.°* While
polls show Fillon well ahead of Le Pen, polls
have been wrong on the UK and Italian referenda
and the US election. The Eurasia Group, for one,
assigns a 30% probability to a Le Pen victory.*”

Second, to what extent will the rise of populism
influence policies in the Eurozone? Here, Germany
will probably provide a litmus test. Chancellor
Angela Merkel and her coalition government are
likely to respond to recent terrorist attacks there by
proposing a stronger police and military presence,
according to the Eurasia Group. Security checks
will probably be increased as well, since at least
800,000 asylum-seekers entered Germany with
minimal security checks and terrorist suspects have
already been arrested among them.°* With German
elections scheduled for September 2017, it remains
to be seen whether Chancellor Merkel will adjust
her immigration policy.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012087.txt,"With Chinese President Xi calling for a heightened effort to
reduce systemic financial risk, regulators have started to tackle
the bloated shadow banking system. Since taking office in
February, Guo Shuqing, China's top banking regulator—with
the nickname “Whirlwind Guo” for his no-nonsense
management style—has already issued a series of directives to
reduce leverage. For example, banks were asked to implement
higher standards for interbank lending and for selling third-
party wealth management products (a primary source of
funding for the shadow banking system). In April, China's top
insurance regulator was detained for corruption, and the
regulatory agency has since taken disciplinary actions against
some high-profile insurance companies that have deviated
from the core insurance business by using shorter-term funding
to finance corporate takeovers, as well as overseas acquisition
sprees.

Tomorrow Never Knows

While we believe China’s economy should hold up well going
into the 19th Party’s Congress this autumn, its growth is likely
to decelerate, and the lagged effects of the tightening measures
on the shadow banking system and on the housing market
could become quite visible by 2018. Housing price changes
could be flat or even negative by this time next year.

If the past is any guide, Chinese policymakers may once again
loosen property purchase restrictions next year to stimulate
growth. Therein lies the moral hazard—it is well known that
Chinese policymakers would not risk a sizeable correction in
the housing market, and therefore would reflate again to
strengthen economic growth. However, with property prices in
China’s tier-one cities already on par with or even exceeding
those of major global cities, it will be hard to rationalize another

These measures have driven up China interbank lending rates,
as well as corporate bond yields. The squeeze on the shadow
banking system has led to a big jump in aborted bond issuance.
In May, China’s net corporate bond issuance dropped to a
record low of negative 217 billion yuan as some bond issuers
were unable to roll over their maturing bonds.

On the housing front, various cities have rolled out new
administrative measures with the aim of keeping housing prices
flat. A few cities even resorted to the draconian measure of a
10-year lock-up period for new apartment purchases—buyers
of new apartments built on recently auctioned off land are
prohibited from selling their units for a decade.

China has also continued to stem the capital outflow. Starting
this July, Chinese banks and financial institutions have to report
all domestic and overseas cash transfers of more than 50,000
yuan ($7,700), compared to the prior threshold of 200,000 yuan
($29,338). Funds transferred overseas are prohibited from
purchasing properties, investments, and insurance products.
Various new restrictions have also been placed on Bitcoin
trading exchanges, as well as overseas use of credit cards. In
short, it appears that capital flight from China will get somewhat
more difficult for ordinary citizens.

round of substantial price increases. In other words, using the
property market as a lever to stimulate economic growth is not
a sustainable long-term solution.

Although equity volatility picked up some in June, most equity
investors still appeared to be basking in the glow of a
synchronized global recovery. However, the canary in the coal
mine may be iron ore: having rallied from the December 2015
low of $37.50 per metric ton to nearly $95 in February 2017, it
has lost roughly 30% to $65 a metric ton by the end of June.

In the final analysis, the global economy has benefited from
China’s rapid growth. However, China will likely be at a
crossroads as President Xi embarks on his second term in 2018.
Will policymakers inflate the housing bubble further to support
economic growth? Will they find new levers to keep the
economy growing above 6% per annum, or will they settle for
a lower but more sustainable pace? The law of large numbers
portends that the next five years will likely be more challenging
for Chinese policymakers than the last five years. @

Therefore, the first thing | wish to point out, concerning that

envelopes. One contained a gram of cocaine; the other contained a

control of a foreign government, not simply a foreign individual or firm. Second,

the diminishing space within America’s Chinese-language media for independent
voices runs counter to the goals of a liberal society seeking a diversity of perspectives.
Furthermore, the PRC’s control of Chinese-language media outlets in America and

its increasingly strong position among English-language outlets provides China
with the potential of mobilizing Chinese Americans and Americans alike to espouse
policies counter to US interest. The constant drumbeat of anti-American reporting

in pro-Beijing media outlets headquartered in the United States creates an unhealthy

environment.

Promoting Transparency

A major challenge is the fact that China has worked successfully to mask its influence
operations with respect to US media. On paper, for example, the Asian Culture and
Media Group controls the pro-China SinoVision and Qiaobao as a private company.
The reality is that it is staffed by people who served the state-run China News Service
and were, sources insist, dispatched to the United States by the Chinese government
to establish propaganda operations in the United States. Given its nominal status

as a private company, taking action to shut down its operations would be fraught
with even more legal and ethical challenges than those involving media corporations
directly owned by the PRC. The same holds true for publications and websites that
were once independent but have now increasingly fallen under the sway of the PRC. If
US law protects the rights of publishers of newspapers or websites to put their personal
political imprint on their enterprises, how can the US government move to deny it to
those of a pro-PRC bent?

At a minimum, what US authorities can do is work to establish the real ownership
structure of Chinese (and other foreign) companies purchasing US-based media. Any
foreign-owned or foreign-controled media (including print media), and particularly
those that advance a foreign government line, should be required to register under the

Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).

Beyond FARA, there should also be a review to see whether these organizations and
their employees should also register under existing lobbying laws as foreign agents.
In addition, there is an argument to be made to ensure that employees of these
organizations should be given a disclosure package making them aware that they are

working for a foreign agent institution.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016410.txt,"There’s yet another level, and probably one day it will have a more interesting
name. With knowledge-based programming, we have a way of creating an actual
representation of real things in the world, in a precise and symbolic way. Not only is it
understandable by brains and communicable to other brains and to computers, it’s also
immediately executable.

Just as natural language gave us civilization, knowledge-based programming will
give us—what? One bad answer is that it will give us the civilization of the Als. That’s
what we don’t want to happen, because the Als will do a great job communicating with
one another and we’ll be left out of it, because there’s no intermediate language, no
interface with our brains. What will this fourth level of knowledge communication lead
to? If you were Caveman Ogg and you were just realizing that language was starting,
could you imagine the coming of civilization? What should we be imagining right now?

This relates to the question of what the world would look like if most people
could code. Clearly, many trivial things would change: Contracts would be written in
code, restaurant recipes might be written in code, and so on. Simple things like that
would change. But much more profound things would also change. The rise of literacy
gave us bureaucracy, for example, which had already existed but dramatically
accelerated, giving us a greater depth of governmental systems, for better or worse. How
does the coding world relate to the cultural world?

Take high school education. If we have computational thinking, how does that
affect how we study history? How does that affect how we study languages, social
studies, and so on? The answer is, it has a great effect. Imagine you’re writing an essay.
Today, the raw material for a typical high school student’s essay is something that’s
already been written; students usually can’t generate new knowledge easily. But in the
computational world, that will no longer be true. If the students know something about
writing code, they’ll access all that digitized historical data and figure out something
new. Then they’ll write an essay about something they’ve discovered. The achievement
of knowledge-based programming is that it’s no longer sterile, because it’s got the
knowledge of the world knitted into the language you’ re using to write code.

There’s computation all over the universe: in a turbulent fluid producing some
complicated pattern of flow, in the celestial mechanics of planetary interactions, in
brains. But does computation have a purpose? You can ask that about any system. Does
the weather have a goal? Does climate have a goal?

Can someone looking at Earth from space tell that there’s anything with a purpose
there? Is there a civilization there? In the Great Salt Lake, in Utah, there’s a straight
line. It turns out to be a causeway dividing two areas of the lake with different colors of
algae, so it’s a very dramatic straight line. There’s a road in Australia that’s long and
straight. There’s a railroad in Siberia that’s long, and lights go on when a train stops at
the stations. So from space you can see straight lines and patterns.

But are these clear enough examples of obvious purpose on Earth as viewed from
space? For that matter, how do we recognize extraterrestrials out there? How do we tell
if a signal we’re getting indicates purpose? Pulsars were discovered in 1967, when we
picked up a periodic flutter every second or so. The first question was, Is this a beacon?

Epstein building compound on Great St. James
By SUZANNE CARLSON Daily News Staff 6 hrs ago
A schematic filed with the Department of Planning and Natural Resources shows development plans for Great St.
James island.
ST. THOMAS —Wealthy sex o!ender Je!rey Epstein has been
quietly working for years to construct a new compound on
Great St. James island o! the East End of St. Thomas, adding
to a massive real estate portfolio that also includes
neighboring Little St. James island, which has been his
primary residence for decades.
Je!rey Epstein
HOGP
V.I. Department of Planning and Natural Resources
spokesman Jamal Nielsen confirmed Monday that at least
some of that construction activity has been taking place
without permission from the government — the third time
in as many years that Epstein has gone beyond the scope of
permitted building plans.
“We have confirmed that there’s unauthorized work going on
at Great St. James, we have been in touch with the owners
and we are setting up to have a meeting with them soon, to
rectify this,” Nielsen said.

Nielsen could not say what specifically the unauthorized
work consists of, but said DPNR Commissioner nominee
Jean-Pierre Oriol would be available by phone today to
answer questions about the situation.
Documents on file at the Coastal Zone Management division
of DPNR show that Epstein used “Great St. Jim, LLC,” a shell
company organized by St. Thomas attorney Erika Kellerhals,
to purchase three parcels totaling 80.1 acres from the Danish
Kjaer family for $17.5 million on Jan. 18, 2016.
The remainder of the island — 12 parcels totaling 81.22 acres
— was transferred from another St. Thomas company, GSJ
Properties Corp., to Great St. Jim LLC for $5 million on Jan.
21, 2016.
While it’s long been rumored that Epstein had purchased
Great St. James, for years his name appeared nowhere on
publicly available documents listing property ownership of
the island.
The Daily News requested access to documents contained in
Coastal Zone Management permit application files for the
island on April 18, and was provided access to those records
Monday.
The documents show that in 2011, Kellerhals, another
attorney in her firm, Gregory Ferguson, and business
consultant Brett Geary organized the St. Thomas company
Poplar Inc.
A certificate of incumbency contained in the file lists Epstein
as president of Poplar Inc., his longtime lawyer Darren
Indyke is listed as vice president and secretary, and another
longtime associate, Richard Kahn, is listed as treasurer.
The Daily Beast reported in April that Kellerhals, Indyke, and
Kahn are listed as the only ocers of other defunct
nonprofits run by Epstein, including the C.O.U.Q.
Foundation, J. Epstein Virgin Islands Foundation, and Epstein
Interests. They’re also listed as ocers for Gratitude America
Ltd., a nonprofit formed in the Virgin Islands in 2012 through
which Epstein has made financial contributions to various
organizations.
The certificate specifically states that those individuals are
authorized to act on behalf of the corporation with respect to
all transactions, “including but not limited to transactions
related to permitting matters submitted on behalf of Great
St. Jim, LLC.”

Kellerhals organized Great St. Jim LLC on Oct. 26, 2015, with
herself as the sole member, and identified Geary’s company,
Business Basics VI LLC, as the resident agent.
Kellerhals could not be reached for comment Monday.
Documents contained in the permit application file show
that DPNR employees and Epstein’s sta! have been
communicating for years about the project.
“[H]i Erika, spoke with Je! yesterday and let him know that
the scopes of work from both applications are being
combined into one single permit. Dave of my sta! is
supposed to reach out to the LSJ [Little St. James] sta! and
arrange when he can make the required site visit. there are
some specific details that were not included in the
application package, so they will have to be verified during
the site visit and notes made on the submitted drawings,”
Oriol wrote to Kellerhals in an email dated Aug. 16, 2016,
under the subject line, “RE: Cistern Permit.”
An email from DPNR legal counsel Michele Baker to
Kellerhals dated Aug. 26, 2016, lists a number of documents
required for the permit application to proceed, and indicates
that “the OWNER” has to sign o!.
Kellerhals responded in an email that “I understand that
there are some places where the owner needs to sign if the
attorney completes the application. I will discuss with Je!rey
and get you copies of those signed attachments asap. You are
correct that I am no longer the sole member. In fact, I am not
a member at all. The only position I serve is as counsel to
Great St. Jim.”
Epstein signed o! on the application for a Coastal Zone
Management major permit on Jan. 10, 2017, identifying
himself as “President of Poplar, Inc., sole member of Great
St. Jim, LLC.”
Permit application documents and site plans on file show
that Epstein is planning a complex of buildings across the
approximately 160-acre island, connected by private road.
The plans include a barge dock, two homes, cottages, an
amphitheater, gardens, a marine electrical cable, solar array
and generator, storage building, security building, workshed
and machine shop, and an “underwater oce & pool.”
The permit application addresses mitigation e!orts for
endangered corals and the Virgin Islands tree boa — which
was spotted on the island during site visits — and indicates
http://www.virginislandsdailynews.com/news/epstein-building-compoun…n-great-st-james/article_a49261e9-40f0-57b1-9501-605e26e74cf3.html

that the public will still have free access to the island’s
shoreline, which includes Christmas Cove, a popular boating
site and home to floating restaurant Pizza Pi.
A wealthy financier long associated with the rich and
powerful, including former President Bill Clinton and
President Donald Trump, Epstein, 66, was convicted in 2008
of procuring a child under the age of 18 for prostitution.
An investigation by the Miami Herald found that despite
evidence Epstein sexually abused dozens of underage girls,
some who say they were forced to have sex with Epstein’s
rich friends at his various homes, including on Little St.
James, federal prosecutor Alexander Acosta — who now
serves as U.S. secretary of labor — worked with Epstein’s
defense attorneys to craft an extraordinarily lenient plea
deal.
A federal judge ruled in February that Miami prosecutors
violated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act when they
intentionally kept that agreement secret from victims in the
case.
While Epstein owns lavish properties in New York City, Palm
Beach, and New Mexico that he travels between on his private
Boeing 727, he lists Little St. James as his primary residence
on his sex o!ender registration.
Epstein last verified his registration with the V.I. Justice
Department on March 15, which lists the 11 vehicles he owns
— all of which are black — including a Mercedes-Benz S550,
Bentley Arnage, Hummer II, Dodge Caravan, Range Rover,
three Chevy Suburbans and three Cadillac Escalades.

The Engineering and Development of Ethics

Co-authored with Stephan Vladimir Bugaj and Joel Pitt

12.1 Introduction

Most commonly, if a work on advanced AI mentions ethics at all, it occurs in a final summary
chapter, discussing in broad terms some of the possible implications of the technical ideas pre-
sented beforehand. It’s no coincidence that the order is reversed here: in the case of CogPrime,
AGLethics considerations played a major role in the design process ... and thus the chapter on
ethics occurs near the beginning rather than the end. In the CogPrime approach, ethics is not
a particularly distinct topic, being richly interwoven with cognition and education and other
aspects of the AGI project.

The ethics of advanced AGI is a complex issue with multiple aspects. Among the many issues
there are:

1. Risks posed by the possibility of human beings using AGI systems for evil ends

2. Risks posed by AGI systems created without well-defined ethical systems

3. Risks posed by AGI systems with initially well-defined and sensible ethical systems eventu-
ally going rogue — an especially big risk if these systems are more generally intelligent than
humans, and possess the capability to modify their own source code

4, the ethics of experimenting on AGI systems when one doesn’t understand the nature of
their experience

5. AGTrights: in what circumstances does using an AGI as a tool or servant constitute “slavery”

In this chapter we will focus mainly (though not exclusively) on the question of how to create
an AGI with a rational and beneficial ethical system. After a somewhat wide-ranging discussion,
we will conclude with eight general points that we believe should be followed in working toward
Friendly AGI — most of which have to do, not with the internal design of the AGI, but with
the way the AGI is taught and interfaced with the real world.

While most of the particulars discussed in this book have nothing to do with ethics, it’s
important for the reader to understand that AGI-ethics considerations have played a major
role in many of our design decisions, underlying much of the technical contents of the book. As
the materials in this chapter should make clear, ethicalness is probably not something that one
can meaningfully tack onto an AGI system at the end, after developing the rest — it is likely
infeasible to architect an intelligent agent and then add on an “ethics module.” Rather, ethics
is something that has to do with all the different memory systems and cognitive processes that

Message: He's absolutely right

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027531
"
IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022723.txt,"interpretation that if Internet solicitation can be considered interstate
commerce, so can telephone solicitation, permitting them to begin a deep
dive investigation into Epstein’s friends, many of whom receive subpoenas
and are threatened with prosecution.

It’s all quite in the eye of the beholder: On the one end, Epstein is
paying for sex acts (Epstein paid $200 for a massage with or without happy
ending), on the other, he is abusing teenage girls. It’s a catch-22: How cana
girl not old enough to vote be a prostitute? And yet, many girls not old
enough to vote are prostitutes.

Compounding Epstein’s predicament, the world outside of his
carefully constructed and controlled environment is someplace that he seems
not just ill-equipped to handle but in which he seems to be blindly grouping
about (i.e. he’s totally tone deaf). I visited him once during this time and
found him weighing the conflicting advice of some of the most vaunted and
egomaniacal lawyers (along with Dershowitz and Black, celebrity criminal
attorney, Gerald Lefcourt, and Clinton prosecutor, Ken Starr) of the
day—anyone with new advice, Epstein seemed to hire—as well as a catchall
of the leading crisis managers, who he seemed to retain at will, all wrangling
for fees and primacy.

Certainly, the upshot of his dealings with the Justice Department seem
to involve a through-the-looking-glass logic. The government threatens
to prosecute him (with the possibility of a 10-year sentence) and
various friends, associates, and lovers, or offers an ass-backwards
sort of deal in which Epstein’s lawyers have to go to the Palm Beach
authorities and get them to agree to charge him with an offense that
will send him to jail and get him a sex offender status. Except that a
solicitation charge won't produce that result. Therefore he has to
agree also to a procurement or pimping charge (even though he has
paid money, not received it—the sine qua non of pimping). What’s
more, he has to agree to pay the legal fees of any of the girls who
want to sue him—and, not to defend himself from their suits—forcing
him to settle with each of the girls for what are reportedly high 6-figure
sums or more.

He’s sentence to jail in 2008 for 18 months and serves 13 (while
Epstein is now frequently accused of somehow managing to cut short
his sentence, almost all Florida prisoners serve only 70% of their
officially sentenced time).

This hardly ends the legal catch all. Epstein's butler, Alfredo
Rodriguez, steals and tries to sell an alleged journal or calendar with

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022723
"
IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031831.txt,"He is hardly alone in making it. Numerous journalists have published books and articles retracing the
paths that led the world economy to the precipice two years ago. The deregulation of the financial
services industry in the 1980s and ’90s; the growing popularity of complex and risky derivatives; the real
estate bubble and the explosion of subprime lending — none of these developments were exactly secret.
On the contrary, they were celebrated as vindications of the power and wisdom of markets. Accordingly,

Mr. Ferguson recycles choice moments of triumphalism, courtesy of Lawrence H. Summers, George W.

Bush, Alan Greenspan and various cable television ranters and squawkers.

Even as stock indexes soared and profits swelled, there were always at least a few investors, economists
and government officials who warned that the frenzied speculation was leading to the abyss. Some of
these prophets without honor show up in front of Mr. Ferguson’s camera, less to gloat than to present,

once again, the analyses that were dismissed and ignored by their peers for so long.

Dozens of interviews — along with news clips and arresting aerial shots of New York, Iceland and other
disaster areas — are folded into a clear and absorbing history, narrated by Matt Damon. The music (an
opening song, “Big Time,” by Peter Gabriel, and a score by Alex Heffes) and the clean wide-screen
cinematography provide an aesthetic polish that is welcome for its own sake and also important to the
movie's themes. The handsomely lighted and appointed interiors convey a sense of the rarefied,
privileged worlds in which the Wall Street operators and their political enablers flourished, and the
elegance of the presentation also subliminally bolsters the film’s authority. This is not a piece of ragged

muckraking or breathless advocacy. It rests its outrage on reason, research and careful argument.

The same was true of Mr. Ferguson’s previous documentary, “No End in Sight,” which focused on

catastrophic policies carried out in Iraq by President George W. Bush’s administration just after the

overthrow of Saddam Hussein. But whereas that film concentrated on a narrow view of a complex subject
— the conduct of the war rather than the at least equally controversial rationale for fighting it — “Inside
Job” offers a sweeping synthesis, going as far back as the Reagan administration and as far afield as

Iceland in its anatomy of the financial crisis.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, many of the highest-profile players declined to be interviewed. Mr. Summers
appears only in news footage, and none of his predecessors or successors as Treasury secretary — not
Robert E. Rubin or Henry M. Paulson Jr. or Timothy F. Geithner — submit to Mr. Ferguson’s questions.
Nor do any of the top executives at Goldman Sachs or the other big banks. Most of the interviewees are,
at least from the perspective of the filmmaker, friendly witnesses, adding fuel to the director’s
comprehensive critique of the way business has been done in the United States and the other advanced

capitalist countries for the past two decades.

Both American political parties are indicted; “Inside Job” is not simply another belated settling of
accounts with Mr. Bush and his advisers, though they are hardly ignored. The scaling back of government
oversight and the weakening of checks on speculative activity by banks began under Reagan and
continued during the Clinton administration. And with each administration the market in derivatives

expanded, and alarms about the dangers of this type of investment were ignored. Raghuram Rajan, chief

LEASE AGREEMENT

In connection with the Spinoff, we entered into a lease agreement dated November 1, 2014, with DriveTime that governs our access to and
utilization of space at DriveTime inspection and reconditioning centers (“IRCs”) for vehicle inspection and reconditioning in Blue Mound, Texas, and
Delanco, New Jersey, and previously for inspection and reconditioning in Winder, Georgia. The lease agreement was most recently amended in December
2018. The agreement also governs utilization of office space and parking spaces at various IRCs and retail facilities that we use as hubs.

Under the amended lease agreement, hubs generally have cancellable two-year terms subject to certain two consecutive one-year renewal
options and subject to the terms of any master lease under which we are subleasing. We increased our utilization of the DriveTime IRCs in Blue Mound,
Texas, and Delanco, New Jersey, to 100% as of July 2018. Under the lease agreement, we pay a monthly rental fee related to our pro rata utilization of
space at such facilities plus a pro rata share of each facility’s actual insurance costs and real estate taxes. As it relates to locations where we recondition
vehicles, our share of facility and reconditioning-supplies expenses are calculated monthly by multiplying the actual costs for operating the inspection
centers by an amount related to our pro rata share of total reconditioned vehicles and parking spaces used at such IRCs in a given month. Total expenses
related to this lease agreement were approximately $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

HOUSTON, TX VENDING MACHINE LEASE GUARANTEE

On July 14, 2015, DriveTime guaranteed our obligations under the lease governing our occupancy of the property on which our Houston
vending machine is located. We do not compensate DriveTime for the guarantee. The initial lease term commenced January 8, 2016, and we began paying
base rent on May 7, 2016. Base rent during the initial term is $23.0 thousand per month, and the initial term expires on April 6, 2026. We have the option to
extend the initial term for four additional consecutive five-year periods. Base rent during each extension term will increase 10% of the then-current base
rent for each subsequent extension.

TEMPE, AZ OFFICE LEASE

In September 2016, we entered into an agreement to lease the second floor of our corporate headquarters in Tempe, Arizona beginning April
2017. Pursuant to this lease, we paid an initial monthly base rent of $107.0 thousand, which increases throughout the duration of the lease. The lease has an
initial term of 83 months and we have three 5-year extension options. At the request of the landlord, DriveTime agreed to partially guarantee our lease
payments until the 30th full calendar month of the lease. We do not compensate DriveTime for the guarantee.

In connection with this lease, we entered into a sublease with DriveTime for our use of the first floor of the same building. Under the sublease,
which is coterminous with DriveTime’s master lease and has a term of 83 months, subject to our right to exercise three 5-year extension options, we pay
DriveTime rent equal to the amounts due under the master lease, including initial monthly base rent of $102.0 thousand, beginning April 1, 2018, which
increases throughout the duration of the sublease and master lease. Total expenses related to this lease agreement were approximately $0.9 million for the
year ended December 31, 2018.

referred to the assassination as “the Bay of Pigs.” And, on May 5, 1977,
the Houston Post published a UPI dispatch that stated:

“Watergate burglar Frank Sturgis said Wednesday that the CIA
planned the break-in because high officials felt Richard Nixon was
becoming too powerful and was overly interested in the assassination of
John Kennedy... ‘Several times the President asked CIA director Richard
Helms for the files on the Kennedy assassination, but Helms refused to
give them to him, refused a direct order from the President,’ Sturgis said.

‘| believe Nixon would have uncovered the true facts in the assassination
of President Kennedy and that would have taken off the heat in Watergate.
Because Nixon wanted files, the CIA felt they had to get rid of him.’
Asked if Nixon ever was in danger, Sturgis replied, ‘Yes, absolutely. Nixon
was lucky he wasn’ t killed—assassinated like President Kennedy.’ ”

One other thing. “A Sneak Preview of Richard Nixon’ s Memoir
was originally published in 1976, in which Nixon insisted that Watergate
was a set-up to get rid of him as president. About a decade later, Tricky
Dick made that exact same claim on a network television interview.

Satirical prophecy in action.

would be a last interview, but the next victim would supply me with three or four
more names and the next one had three or four names and it just kept getting
bigger and bigger,” Recarey said.

By then, word had gotten back to Epstein from some of the girls that they had
been questioned by police. Epstein hired famed lawyer Alan Dershowitz.

“Alan Dershowitz flew down and met privately with Krischer,”’ Recarey said. “And
the shenanigans that happened, I don’t think I’ve ever seen or heard of before.”

Police reports show that Epstein’s private investigators attempted to conduct
interviews while posing as cops; that they picked through Reiter’s trash in search
of dirt to discredit him; and that the private investigators were accused of
following the girls and their families. In one case, the father of one girl claimed
he had been run off the road by a private investigator, police and court reports
show.

Several of the girls said they felt intimidated and frightened by Epstein and Sarah
Kellen, the millionaire’s assistant and alleged scheduler of massages, who warned
them not to talk to police, according to the police report.

Dershowitz, in an interview with the Herald, said he had nothing to do with
gathering background on the girls — or in directing anyone to follow the police, or
the girls and their families.

understanding would be that if her -- and this is --
could I ask a question about the circling -- or your
representation?

Is the circling the same type of circling
that is done for Mr. Dershowitz, for example? Is it the
same, you know, handwriting, same ink, same -- same
appearance? You know, if it's consistent with the
circling -- are you representing it's consistent with
the circling?

Q. Mr. Cassell, we have a document produced in

discovery that has various names circled. Looking at
the document, I don't see any difference among the
circles. Are you aware of any document --
MR. SCAROLA: Could we have a look -- could
we see the document?
MR. SIMPSON: Take a -- go off the record for
one moment.
THE WITNESS: We are going off the video
record, 10:03.
(Thereupon, a recess was taken.)
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: We are back on the video
record, 10:08 a.m.
MR. SIMPSON: Okay. Back on the record. I'm
going to ask the reporter to mark as Cassell
Exhibit 5, a multi-page document. It's a copy of

the address book we have been speaking about, and
ask that Doc -- Mr. Cassell to take a look at
this, and I'm going to ask him about certain of
the entries.

(Cassell's I.D. Exhibit No. 5 - copy of
address book was marked for identification.)
MR. SIMPSON: And I will note, I put a few
flags on here --

THE WITNESS: Sure.

all right, just to get them in --

A. No, not on the exhibit. I'm just going to
make notes to refresh my recollection so we don't have
to take time. I'm just -- I'm just making notes of the

Q. Take as long as you want to look at the
document.

A. Super. Thank you.

Okay. Yeah. I think I'm -- I'm oriented
now. But I haven't looked at the Love entry.

Q. My -- my first --

A. Iwant to look at the Love --

Q.  -- question is: Is this a copy of the
address book that you referred to in your testimony?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. And if you would take a look at the --
I've marked the entries for Courtney Love. Take a look
at that one.

A. Allright. I see it.

Q. Okay. And then if you look at the last
entry, there's an entry for Professor Dershowitz that's
also circled. It should be on the flag. It's
two-sided.

A. Oh, yeah.

Q. Do you see that one?

A. Isee it.

Q. And then also the other one I marked is
Donald Trump.

A, Yes. Gotit. I see those entries circled.

ESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS
(954) 331-4400
231

Q. So am I right -- I'm right, am I not, that
among the others circled are: Courtney Love, Donald
Trump, and Alan Dershowitz, correct?

A. Correct, among the others, yes.

Q. And they are all circled in the same way; are
they not?

A, Yeah. It's kind of a -- a box is what I
would say. Some, yes.

Q. Is there anything on the face of that
document that leads you to conclude that the circling --
the significance of the circling is any different for
one person than another?

A. No.

Q. So based on the document, do you infer that
Courtney Love was involved in some kind of sexual abuse
of minors?

A. Iwould infer that if I were running a
criminal investigation through the FBI and I'm trying to
find people who would have relevant information, she
would be one of the people I'd want to talk to. I mean,
the names that are circled here, Glenn Maxwell, one of
the identified traffickers, Epstein is circled, the
pilot -~ one of the pilots is circled. So it's these
people that all seemed to be connected are -- are all
being marked here, and -- and the number of people that

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013109.txt,"11.4 Piaget’s Stages in the Context of Uncertain Inference 193

Stage Substages

Dualism / Received|Basic duality (“All problems are solvable. I must learn the
Knowledge correct solutions.”)

[Infantile] Full dualism (“There are different, contradictory solutions to

many problems. I must learn the correct solutions, and ignore
the incorrect ones”)

Multiplicity Early multiplicity (“Some solutions are known, others aren’t.
[Concrete] I must learn how to find correct solutions.”)

Late Multiplicity: cognitive dissonance regarding truth.
(“Some problems are unsolvable, some are a matter of personal
taste, therefore I must declare my own intellectual path.”)

Relativism / Procedu-]Contextual Relativism (“I must learn to evaluate solutions

ral Knowledge within a context, and relative to supporting observation.”)
[Formal] Pre-Commitment (“I must evaluate solutions, then commit to
a choice of solution.”)

Commitment / Con-|Commitment (“I have chosen a solution.”)

structed Knowledge Challenges to Commitment (“I have seen unexpected implica-
[Formal / Reflexive] [tions of my commitment, and the responsibility I must take.”)
Post-Commitment (“I must have an ongoing, nuanced rela-
tionship to the subject in which I evaluate each situation on a

case-by-case basis with respects to its particulars rather than
an ad-hoc application of unchallenged ideology.”)

Table 11.2: Perry’s Developmental Stages [with corresponding Piagetan Stages in brackets]

Observationally, this appears to be the case in humans. People learn things gradually, and
show a continuous development in ability, not a quick jump from ignorance to mastery. We
believe that this gradual development of ability is the signature of genuine learning, and that
prescriptively an AGI system must be designed in order to have continuous and asymmetrical
development across a variety of tasks in order to be considered a genuine learning system. While
quantum leaps in ability may be possible in an AGI system which can just “graft” new parts
of brain onto itself (or an augmented human which may someday be able to do the same using
implants), such acquisition of knowledge is not really learning. Grafting on knowledge does not
build the cognitive pathways needed in order to actually learn. If this is the only mechanism
available to an AGI system to acquire new knowledge, then it is not really a learning system.

11.4 Piaget’s Stages in the Context of Uncertain Inference

Piaget’s developmental stages are very general, referring to overall types of learning, not specific
mechanisms or methods. This focus was natural since the context of his work was human de-
velopmental psychology, and neuroscience has not yet progressed to the point of understanding
the neural mechanisms underlying any sort of inference (and certainly was nowhere near to
doing so in Piaget’s time!). But if one is studying developmental psychology in an AGI context
where one knows something about the internal mechanisms of the AGI system under consid-
eration, then one can work with a more specific model of learning. Our focus here is on AGI
systems whose operations contain uncertain inference as a central component. Obviously the
main focus is CogPrime, but the essential ideas apply to any other uncertain inference centric
AGI architecture as well.

they were nothing like the demons he'd heard about in church.
Noel had never forgotten the way those kids looked. The way
they'd turned into old men and old women. They were like zom-
bies trapped in children’s bodies. And now, in America, Noel's
been given a chance to help other kids.

That’s what the police have told him, at least.

Noel is a sanitation worker. Still strong at fifty, and lucky
enough to have found his way to Palm Beach, he gets in to work
before anyone else and keeps his white compactor truck clean,
almost glistening. His pickup route runs hot and cold with the
seasons. But even in the summer, with much less to do, he’s on
the job early, braced for a six-hour shift that would break a lesser
man’s back. In the winter, the job gets even harder. The Estate
Section gets especially busy. Some of the parties have hundreds
of guests. They leave behind mountains of refuse. That garbage
gets picked up daily, or twice a day when requested. It’s carried
~ by workers who slip, silently, under the porte cocheres. Then it
gets whisked twenty miles away to a landfill that the garbage-
men call Mount Trashmore.

Noel's stretch of the Estate Section runs from the Everglades
Club to the southernmost tip of the island. It encompasses Ban-
yan Road, Jungle Road, El Bravo Way, and El Brillo Way. His per-
formance record is spotless. As far as the Palm Beach PD is

concerned, he’s the perfect man for the job.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028929.txt,"This is particularly true when ABC knows or should know that several, very specific
allegations of Jane Doe 3 have been rebutted and/or demonstrated by others to be false. For
example, I understand that she has accused distinguished Professor Alan Dershowitz of Harvard
Law School of sexual misconduct involving her. Professor Dershowitz has flatly denied that
allegation under oath in a federal court proceeding. I further understand that Professor
Dershowitz offered to play a tape recording for Mr. Hill that evidences that Jane Doe 3 has made
recent contradictory statements—that is, that she was pressured into including Professor
Dershowitz in her allegations and that she has a financial motive in making these allegations.

The Duke of York and the Royal Palace have likewise unequivocally denied Jane Doe’s
similar allegations against the Duke. Surely, these unequivocal statements of denial of respected
members of society are entitled to some deference by ABC, particularly where, as here, there is
substantial evidence of bias, improper motive, and serious credibility problems of their accuser.

Moreover, additional claims of Jane Doe 3 can be refuted with objective evidence that is
readily obtainable by ABC. For example, she claims she was in the presence of both former
President Clinton (after January 20, 2001, and before the summer of 2002) and former Vice
President Gore (and his wife) at Mr. Epstein’s Virgin Island home. I have been told by Mr. Hill
that she claims to be 100% sure of the facts regarding President Clinton. The claims are
completely uncorroborated and compellingly contradicted by others. Neither former President
Clinton nor former Vice-President Gore and his wife have ever been present at Mr. Epstein’s
Virgin Island home. A review of United States Secret Service records, obtainable through a
Freedom of Information Request would prove the falsity of the claim. Virgin Island government
records would provide further confirmation. I also believe that Mr. Hill has been told by
individuals with percipient knowledge that former President Clinton has never been to Mr.
Epstein’s Virgin Island home. Upon inquiry, I am certain that you would receive similar denials
from Mr. and Mrs. Gore either directly or by or through their counsel Mr. Boies. Jane Doe 3’s
fabrication of these claims against respected former officials undermines completely the
trustworthiness of each and every one of her remaining allegations.

We would expect that, in the wake of the damning independent review of Rolling Stone’s
publications of rape allegations involving students at the University of Virginia, ABC would
proceed with similar, uncorroborated allegations with extreme caution. At the very least, ABC
has an obligation to verify—with independent evidence—the truthfulness of Jane Doe 3’s
claims. Merely declining to air those portions of her interview that relate to President Clinton
and Vice-President Gore is insufficient. If ABC has concerns about her credibility with respect
to any allegation, it must decline to republish all of her allegations.

In June of 2008, Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty to Florida state charges that do not relate to
Jane Doe 3. After an extensive investigation, the United States declined to prosecute Mr. Epstein
and provided him with a Non-Prosecution Agreement. Mr. Epstein fully conformed to the
responsibilities and obligations imposed on him by that agreement. Mr. Epstein is not engaged
in public activities. He is a private person who has complied and continues to comply with his
legal obligations, and he is attempting to move forward with his life in a productive way. The
allegations of Jane Doe 3 are neither credible nor news worthy. ABC should not publish them.

Bruno Le Maire criticizes the French PM for failing to present efficient solutions to the crisis in Syria. Instead 
the PM has been merely following the course of Obama, who, according to Bruno, does not know what he 
wants. Such an approach has weakened the influence of France on the international arena and has undermined 
its sovereignty. 
Also watched some other videos of him - Bruno attacks Hollande for his tax policy and excuses him for not

The Crime Scene Investigation

Any private contractor, not even an employee of the government,
could walk into the NSA building, take whatever they wanted,
and walk out with it and they would never know.

—EDWARD SNOWDEN, Moscow, 2014

| aaa MILES NORTHWEST of Honolulu on the island of Oahu,
adjacent to the sprawling Wheeler Air Force Base, is a 250,000-
square-foot, man-made mound of earth and reinforced concrete sur-
rounded by an electrified fence. Inside the mound is a three-story
structure originally built by the air force in World War II as a bomb-
proof aircraft repair facility. In the Cold War, it was modernized to
withstand enemy chemical, biological, radiological, or electromag-
netic pulse attacks and was used by the navy’s operation center for
its Pacific fleet. After the Cold War, the huge edifice was turned over
to the NSA, which, as stated earlier, had been created as an intelli-
gence service to intercept the communications and signals of foreign
countries after World War II, a mission that included vacuuming
into its giant computer arrays telephone messages, missile telem-
etry, submarine signals, and virtually everything on the electro-
magnetic spectrum of interest to the U.S. Defense Department and
USS. intelligence agencies. As the NSA developed it, this Hawaiian
base became one of its primary regional bases for gathering Asian

Palestinians know exactly what's happening. People don't have high
expectations.... But maybe the Palestinian leadership should tell the
people that after 20 years we don't have a partner and we cannot
continue to be an authority in name only. That we should throw in the
towel.

Many see that as a bluff. Wouldn't you be throwing away years of
progress, institutions, security forces and putting hundreds of
thousands of people out of work?

We haven't made a decision. I'm not asking for the disbanding of the
authority. But I'm asking: Is this the authority that will take us to
independence? It's a joke.... The status quo is the worst situation for
us, worse than any storm that might come. I'm not in a position to
bluff or make threats. It's about choices.

It sounds like you are hoping that Israel will cry uncle.

Eighteen years ago I would have accepted this argument. But now I'm
a grandpa. I used to tell my wife that I never wanted my children to
go through what I went through, but then they did. And I didn't want
my grandchildren to go through it, and they are.

How does any of this get Israelis and Palestinians closer to an
agreement or get Palestinians closer to statehood?

At least I won't be looking in the mirror and telling myself that I'm
fooling my people.

As I previously mentioned, my initial assignment as Justice Goldberg’s law clerk was to write a
memorandum on the possible unconstitutionality of the death penalty. Here is how [ find
author] , in his book , describes the origins of this lifelong collaborative effort.

[Justice Goldberg] called his law clerk Alan Dershowitz into his office and advanced the
decidedly immodest idea of using the Constitution to end the death penalty in America.

“The Eighth Amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment,” Goldberg told
Dershowitz. “What could be more cruel than the deliberate decision by the state to take a
human life?”

Alan Dershowitz immediately understood the impudence of Goldberg’s proposal. It was
Dershowitz’s very first day on the job and the young clerk, already brimming with energy
and enthusiasm, was elated by the Justice’s proposed agenda.

When Goldberg sat down with Dershowitz in the summer of 1963, not even the American
Civil Liberties Union believed that capital punishment posed a potential violation of
constitutional rights. Dershowitz made this point to Goldberg. “At the time the Eighth
Amendment was enacted, the colonists were executing people all over the place.

Certainly the framers of the Constitution did not regard the death penalty as
unconstitutional.”

“Therein lies the beauty of our Bill of Rights,” Goldberg said. “It’s an evolving document.
It means something different today than it meant in 1792.”

In Alan Dershowitz, Goldberg found a kindred spirit and a life story that was in many
ways the New York parallel of his own Chicago childhood...Dershowitz had an aversion
to capital punishment, which traced back to his childhood. Dershowitz argued against
capital punishment as a member of his high school debating team. [I still have a
handwritten card from my first high school debate in which I advocate the “abolision of
C.P.” because “most murderers are products of invironment.”] In law school, he wrote a
letter to the Prime Minister of Israel...arguing that the death penalty was inappropriate
even for Adolf Eichmann.

Goldberg’s choice of Dershowitz to write his capital punishment opinion was no
coincidence. Goldberg passed on the issue during his first year on the bench in part
because he did not feel that he had the right clerks. He inherited his first set of clerks from
Felix Frankfurter. Though he had high regard for the retiring justice’s selections, he didn’t
feel they were right for the job.

They worked together through scholarship and advocacy against the death penalty for the
remainder of Goldberg’s life. It is difficult to imagine that Goldberg could have found a
more willing and able confederate than Alan Dershowitz.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028164.txt,"/ BARAK / 30

I’d tried not to pay too much attention to newspaper polls during the campaign,
perhaps because even the “good” ones, to use Shimon’s phrase, had me with just a
narrow lead, with Yitzhik Mordechai’s 10 or 11 percent still likely to prevent
outright victory in the first round. But in the second part of May, our internal
polling showed things were moving in our direction. In mid-May, they had me
above 40 percent. A final batch of internal polls, on the Friday before election day,
had me just short of 50 percent. But I told our pollsters that under no circumstances
were they to divulge the results to anyone in the campaign team. This wasn’t just
because I wanted to guard against complacency. It was because, deep down, still I
didn’t trust the numbers.

I retreated to Kochav Yair on Friday evening. On Saturday, two days before the
election, I had a surprise visitor, someone I knew from Yitzhik Mordecai’s team.
He said he had a letter for me, with terms of a proposal under which Yitzhik would
announce an eleventh-hour withdrawal from the race. I still could not be absolutely
confident I’d win, at least in the first round. Yitzhik’s pulling out would help. But
if I did win, I wanted to start the process of assembling a coalition with a blank
slate and an open mind. Doing a deal was not the way to begin. I didn’t accept or
open the envelope. “Go back to Yitzhik,” I said. “Tell him, as he knows, that I
have a lot of respect for him. But this is a decision that he has to make on his own.”

The next day, less than 24 hours before the polls opened, all of the three other
candidates announced they were pulling out. Benny Begin and Azmi Beshara were
never going to affect the outcome. But Yitzhik’s withdrawal very possibly would.
When he spoke to reporters, he said it had been one of the most difficult decisions
he’d had to make, but that he’d concluded he wouldn’t get enough votes to reach

THE

Our Struggle to See the True Threat

BILE SLEGEL

FrontPage Interview’s guest today is Bill Siegel, a lawyer and
business executive. He has been a producer of several documentary films and assists numerous non-profit

organizations. He is the author of The Control Factor: Our Struggle to See the True Threat.
FP: Bill Siegel, welcome to FrontPage Interview.

Congratulations on this brilliant book. It is without question one of the most vital works of our time.
Let’s begin with what inspired you to write it.

Siegel: Thanks for having me Jamie. As a young boy born in the mid 1950s, I was fascinated with footage of
Hitler and the Third Reich and could never understand how the Jews of the time could not see the evil that
seemed so obvious. Not yet appreciative of the benefit of hindsight, I could not comprehend the blindness.
Following 9/11, like so many others, I began to study Islam, its history, its current movements, terrorism and
so on. As I would learn one stunning aspect after another, I would discuss them with friends and associates.
Rather than confront the facts I would present, they would find one clever way after another to avoid the
frightening truth of what America and the West truly face. Their fear appeared obvious to me. I began to
catalog many of my friends’ different maneuvers to dispel the anxiety that they found so difficult to endure.
The more I focused on their mental processes (as well as my own) the more I began to see a structure to the
mental endeavor and to understand what I had, as a child, found so difficult to explain.

FP: Tell us about the Control Factor, what you describe as “that effort our minds enga ge in in order to keep
us blind” and that “process of a voiding seeing the threats we face.” It’s also about, as you state, trying to
believe that the threat is under our control, when in fact it is not. Kindly enlighten us as to these profound
insights you make in terms of the Control Factor.

Siegel: First, let’s distinguish the ”real world” where real battles are taking place from the mental battlefield
which occurs in each of our minds. We tend to believe our perceptions are simply clear realizations of what
is “out there” and overlook how much our internal worlds can literally determine what we see. When our
internal minds become anxious and sense a loss of “control,” they tend to concoct ways to distort our

Chapter 12: The death penalty for those who don’t kill: Ricky and Raymond Tison

The story of the Tison case was the stuff of films and television dramas. It involved two families.
The family of the killer consisted of the father, mother and three sons. The family of the victims
consisted of a father, mother, baby and niece. They would meet, with horrendous consequences,
on a dark, isolated road in Arizona.

Beyond the tragic facts of the case was the important legal issue they presented, since neither
Ricky nor his brother Raymond Tison actually killed anyone. Nor did they intend anyone to die
when they helped their father Gary and his cellmate Randy Greenawalt escape from prison. But at
least four innocent people—including a baby and a 15 year old girl—were brutally murdered by
the prisoners whom the Tison brothers helped escape.*’ And for playing that role Ricky and
Raymond Tison, who were teenagers, were sentenced to die in the Arizona gas chamber.

As part of the overall challenge to the death penalty, abolitionists were focusing on the significant
number of death row inmates who had neither killed nor intended to kill. Most of these non-
triggermen had been convicted of murder on the basis of two legal fictions. The first was the law
of conspiracy under which each member of a conspiracy is deemed to have committed every
crime actually committed by any co-conspirator*’ (Remember Harry Reems.) The second legal
fiction was the law of felony-murder under which anyone who intentionally commits a serious
felony, such as breaking someone out of prison, is deemed to have “intended” any death that
results from the felony, even if he actually intended that no one should die. The combined effect
of these fictions was to deem Ricky and Raymond as guilty of intentional murder as Gary Tison
and Randy Greenawalt who actually pulled the trigger and intended to kill the victims.

The Tison case thus starkly presented an issue that had not clearly been resolved by the Supreme
Court since the Furman case: Can conspirators who helped murderers escape from prison be
sentenced to death for intentional murders committed by their co-conspirators, if the conspirators
themselves neither killed nor intended to kill.

I was first approached to help the Tison brothers by a journalist who was working on a book and
film project about the case (eventually a film, called A Killer In the Family, was made starring
Robert Mitchum as the father and James Spader—in his first cinemographic role—as one of the
brothers.) I was asked to appeal their death sentence. Since they had no money, I agreed to
prepare and argue the appeal without a fee.

I know the appeal would be tough because the facts of the murders were horrible and the
personnel on the Supreme Court was changing in a rightward direction. The strongest point in
our favor were the facts of the case as they related directly to the brothers Tison. Their story was
compelling.

compromises that we might have to contemplate during peace negotiations were
still anathema to many other Israelis.

Syria was always my first negotiating priority, as it had been for Rabin and, for
a brief period, Bibi as well. This was not just because the shape of a final
agreement with the Syrians was clearer, to both sides, than with the Palestinians. It
was because I was determined to make good on the main specific policy pledge of
my campaign: to bring our troops home from Lebanon. No matter what the
increasingly emboldened fighters of Hizbollah said publicly, our withdrawal would
be bad news for them. It would deprive them of their “‘anti-occupation” rationale
for firing Katyushas into towns and settlements in northern Israel, and free us
politically to strike back hard if that proved necessary. It was clear to me that
Hizbollah would try to make the withdrawal as difficult for us as possible. But the
real power in Lebanon rested with the Syrians, who, along with Iran, were
Hizbollah’s main backers. If we could get a peace agreement with Assad, there
seemed every reason to hope he would rein in Hizbollah, and perhaps open the way
to a peace treaty with Lebanon as well.

Still, there was no way of hiding an additional attraction in getting a deal with
Syria first: it would increase our negotiating leverage with the Palestinians. That
would certainly not be lost on Yasir Arafat — one reason that I realized the
importance of an early meeting with him, to convey my commitment to keeping
the Oslo process alive, and, if possible, achieving a full and final Israeli-Palestinian
peace.

I went to see Arafat a few days after taking office. We met for well over an
hour at Erez, the main crossing point into Gaza. It was swelteringly hot inside. At
least I was in an ordinary business suit, but I couldn’t help wondering how Arafat

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021111.txt,"The bureau already has some explaining to do. Thanks to the Washington Post’s unnamed law-enforcement
leakers, we know Mr. Nunes’s request deals with a “top secret intelligence source” of the FBI and CIA,
who is a U.S. citizen and who was involved in the Russia collusion probe. When government agencies refer
to sources, they mean people who appear to be average citizens but use their profession or contacts to spy
for the agency. Ergo, we might take this to mean that the FBI secretly had a person on the payroll who used

his or her non-FBI credentials to interact in some capacity with the Trump campaign.

This would amount to spying, and it is hugely disconcerting. It would also be a major escalation from the
electronic surveillance we already knew about, which was bad enough. Obama political appointees
rampantly “unmasked” Trump campaign officials to monitor their conversations, while the FBI played dirty
with its surveillance warrant against Carter Page, failing to tell the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court
that its supporting information came from the Hillary Clinton campaign. Now we find it may have also been

rolling out human intelligence, John Le Carré style, to infiltrate the Trump campaign.

Which would lead to another big question for the FBI: When? The bureau has been doggedly sticking with
its story that a tip in July 2016 about the drunken ramblings of George Papadopoulos launched its
counterintelligence probe. Still, the players in this affair—the FBI, former Director Jim Comey, the Steele
dossier authors—have been suspiciously vague on the key moments leading up to that launch date. When
precisely was the Steele dossier delivered to the FBI? When precisely did the Papadopoulos information

come in?

And to the point, when precisely was this human source operating? Because if it was prior to that infamous
Papadopoulos tip, then the FBI isn’t being straight. It would mean the bureau was spying on the Trump
campaign prior to that moment. And that in turn would mean that the FBI had been spurred to act on the

basis of something other than a junior campaign aide’s loose lips.

We also know that among the Justice Department’s stated reasons for not complying with the Nunes
subpoena was its worry that to do so might damage international relationships. This suggests the “source”
may be overseas, have ties to foreign intelligence, or both. That’s notable, given the highly suspicious role
foreigners have played in this escapade. It was an Australian diplomat who reported the Papadopoulos
conversation. Dossier author Christopher Steele is British, used to work for MI6, and retains ties to that spy
agency as well as to a network of former spooks. It was a former British diplomat who tipped off Sen. John

McCain to the dossier. How this “top secret” source fits into this puzzle could matter deeply.

I believe I know the name of the informant, but my intelligence sources did not provide it to me and refuse

to confirm it. It would therefore be irresponsible to publish it. But what is clear is that we’ve barely

bounties from money raised on the Internet. In 2015, for instance,
WikiLeaks offered $100,000 bounties to any whistle-blowers who
provided the site with secret documents exposing details of the
Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement.

Nor is acting alone necessarily a line that divides whistle-blowers
from spies. In many cases, whistle-blowers have accomplices who
help them carry out their mission. For example, in 1969, the cel-
ebrated whistle-blower Daniel Ellsberg, a military analyst at the
Rand Corporation, had an accomplice, Anthony Russo, who had also
worked at Rand. (Both were indicted by the government.) Acting in
concert, they copied secret documents that became known famously
as the Pentagon Papers.

Whistle-blowers can also, like conventional spies, enter into elabo-
rate conspiracies to carry out an operation. On the night of March 8,
1971, eight whistle-blowers working together with burglary tools
broke into the FBI office in Media, Pennsylvania, and stole almost all
the FBI files there. The conspirators escaped and kept their identities
secret for over forty-two years.

© Self-definitions also do not necessarily produce a distinction ©
between whistle-blowers and conventional spies. Consider Philip
Agee, who left the CIA in 1969 for what he described as “reasons
of conscience.” Specifically, he said he objected to the CIA’s covert
support of Latin American dictators. After contacting the Soviet
embassy in Mexico City, he defected to Cuba, where he leaked infor-
mation that exposed CIA operations. Although Agee insisted he was
a whistle-blower, and he adamantly denied offering any secrets to the
Soviet Union, the KGB viewed him as a conventional spy. Accord-
ing to Oleg Kalugin, the top Soviet counterintelligence officer in the
KGB in Moscow, who defected to the United States, Agee offered
CIA secrets first to the KGB residency in Mexico City in 1973 and
then to the Cuban intelligence service. Agee provided the KGB with
a “treasure trove” of U.S. secrets, Kalugin revealed. “I then sat in
my office in Moscow reading the growing list of revelations coming
from Agee.” Despite this disparity, Agee still defined himself to the
public as a whistle-blower because he also had exposed CIA opera-
tions to the public.

The Snowden case blurs the demarcation line even further. Unlike

Subject: Epstein prosecutor was rebuked for prior child sex case I Miami Herald 
Attachments: Sp_Marie_Villafana2.jpg; WilliamZloch.jpeg; acosta.jpg 
Importance: High 
https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article226765309.html 
Jeffrey Epstein prosecutor was 
previously rebuked for handling of a 
child sex case 
Julie K. Brown 
Nine months before cutting a covert plea deal with sex trafficking suspect Jeffrey 
Epstei , Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta was notified that the lead 
prosecutor in Epstein's case had concealed victim information in another underage 
sex crimes case, the Miami Herald has learned. 
The prosecutor, A. Marie Villafaria, was harshly rebuked by a federal judge in 
January 2007 for what he called her intentional and/or serious lapse in judgment 
when she failed to explicitly inform him that the defendant, a Texas man who 
traveled to Florida to have sex with a 14-year-old girl, had a prior history of 
predatory behavior with minors, court records show. 
Acosta, her boss at the time, not only knew about Villafaria's breach — records show 
that he subsequently defended it. Acosta assigned another prosecutor in his office to 
write a treatise for the judge in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade him to soften 
the stinging language in his order. 
Senior U.S. District Court Judge William J. Zloch copied Acosta on his order, 
noting, The court is at a total loss as to why the Office of the United States Attorney 
for the Southern District of Florida, as well as the Assistant United States Attorney 
assigned to the above-styled cause, found it appropriate to intentionally withhold ... 
information from the court. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021740 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021741 
A. Marie Villafaria was the lead federal prosecutor in the Jeffrey Epstein sex case. The U.S. attorney's office's handling of 
the prosecution, which led to a plea to minor charges in state court, has been harshly criticized. 
Later that year, Acosta and Villafaria put together a plea bargain for Epstein, a 
multimillionaire money manager who sexually abused nearly three dozen teenage 
girls at his mansion in Palm Beach. The deal, a federal judge ruled last month, was 
intentionally kept from his victims in violation of the Crime Victims' Rights Act. 
While the two cases are unrelated, it shows that both Acosta and Villafaria had been 
warned about the importance of victim disclosure in sex crimes cases before the 
Epstein agreement. They nevertheless forged ahead with a pact with Epstein that 
violated the law. 
U.S. District Court Judge Kenneth A. Marra wrote: When the Government gives 
information to victims, it cannot be misleading. While the Government spent untold 
hours negotiating the terms and implications of the [agreement] with Epstein's 
attorneys, scant information was shared with victims. 
This comes as Acosta, who is now the U.S. secretary of labor, is facing mounting 
scrutiny for his oversight of the Epstein case. On Monday, White House press 
secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to say whether President Trump has full 
confidence in Acosta, noting that Acosta's involvement in the Epstein case is 
GG 
currently under review. 
The Justice Department launched a probe in January into whether Acosta, Villafaria 
and other prosecutors committed professional misconduct. 
Francey Hakes, who worked in the Justice Department's Crimes Against Children 
unit, said Zloch's comments were so brutal that it should have deterred Acosta and 
Villafaria from keeping the deal secret. 
It is highly unusual for a court to allege an assistant U.S. attorney has intentionally 
withheld information. That allegation is like dropping a bomb in the legal 
community, she said. 
The story behind a Palm Beach sex offender's remarkable deal 
Palm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein is a free man, despite sexually abusing 
dozens of underage girls according to police and prosecutors. His victims have never 
had a voice, until now. 
It seems to show that they are not taking these cases very seriously, they are not 
advocating for strong punishment for sexual predators, and not advocating for 
victims in a meaningful way. 
Villafaria, a well-regarded 18-year veteran federal prosecutor, would not comment 
for this story. But her lawyer, Jonathan Biran, said she has worked tirelessly on 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021742 
behalf of crime victims. She received the 2011 National Crime Victims' Rights 
Service Award as well as the Attorney General's Project Safe Childhood Award. 
He also pointed out that the parents of the victim in the Texas man's case wrote a 
letter thanking Villafaria at the conclusion of the case. 
AUSA Villafaria has spent her 18-year career advocating tirelessly on behalf of 
victims of some of the most serious crimes in Florida, and has received numerous 
awards for her successful prosecution of major cases, Biran said, adding that 
Villafaria has made South Florida a safer place for children and adults alike. 
Enticing a minor 
By all accounts, Adam McDaniel was an awkward and shy Texas teenager who spent 
countless hours on his computer, socializing with girls on the internet. 
In 2005, McDaniel, then 19, traveled from Texas to Fort Lauderdale, where he 
hopped into a taxi and headed to Boca Raton to meet up with a 14-year-old girl he 
had been talking to online for about a year. He picked up the ninth grader at a high 
school basketball game, and drove her to a Marriott, hotel where they spent the 
night, court records show. 
When she failed to come home that evening, her parents called Boca Raton police. 
Officers tracked the pair down at the hotel the next day, where they found them in 
bed, clad in little more than their underwear, according to court records. 
McDaniel was arrested on federal sex charges, and pleaded guilty on Oct. 6, 2006, to 
enticing a minor into sexual conduct by means of interstate commerce, which 
carried a sentence of from five years up to 30 years in federal prison. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021743 
U.S. District Judge William Zloch 
At sentencing, McDaniel's public defender, Patrick Hunt, argued for a reduced 
sentence, blaming his client's immaturity for the crime. McDaniel had been a good 
student at Texas Tech and had a family that supported him, Hunt told Zloch. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021744 
Family and acquaintances, including a former Fort Worth police lieutenant, 
submitted letters to the court vouching for McDaniel's character. 
There were other issues, however, presented to the judge. While McDaniel was 
being held in federal lockup awaiting sentencing, he had corresponded with his 
victim, despite being ordered not to contact her, the court record shows. 
Still, Hunt argued that a sentence of five years was overly harsh. 
Villafaria disagreed, but conceded that McDaniel would benefit from psychological 
treatment. She advocated for a sentence of five to sex years, which was at the low 
end of the guideline. 
It was then that the judge heard from the victim's mother. 
In a statement, the mother decried the emotional and mental trauma her daughter 
suffered and the long road to recovery she had ahead of her. The mother mentioned 
she was further upset that McDaniel continued contact with her daughter after his 
arrest and she said she believed that McDaniel was still trying to manipulate her 
daughter by blaming her for his arrest. 
The mother pointed out that prior to their sexual encounter, McDaniel had directed 
her daughter to watch sexually explicit movies and had described for her sex 
activities he had had with another underage girl. 
At that point, the judge interrupted. 
...There has been some reference to another incident with a minor girl. What do 
you know about that, if anything? Zloch asked Villafaria. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021745 
Former U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta never told sexual-abuse victims of a lenient plea 
deal for Jeffrey Epstein.

Only then did Zloch learn that McDaniel had preyed on other girls over the internet, 
including a 16-year-old California girl whom he brought to Texas and impregnated. 
He was also having another relationship with a 15-year-old girl at the time of his 
arrest, Villafaria admitted in court. 
The judge promptly sentenced McDaniel to 10 years — twice what Villafaria 
recommended. 
Three months later, in January 2007, after reviewing the entire case, Zloch issued 
an order excoriating Villafaria for failing to tell him about McDaniel's prior history. 
The serial nature of defendant's seduction of minor girls was revealed for the first 
time to the court upon the Government's response to the Court's inquiry, Zloch 
wrote, explaining that the defendant's past was evidence of predatory behavior that 
warranted a harsher sentence because he may pose a danger to the community. 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Lourie was assigned to try to correct the record and 
persuade the judge to strike a portion of his comments. They argued that since 
McDaniel had never before been charged with a crime, the history was not relevant 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021746 
at sentencing. The defendant's prior relationship with a 16-year-old was not illegal 
in Texas or in California, they said, and the girl classified her relationship as a 
friendship. 
All the relevant information was provided to the probation department and at 
McDaniel's detention hearing, they added, making the point that it was in the record 
and therefore, not intentionally withheld by the government. 
While Zloch conceded that the information was part of the probation and bond 
hearing record, he said it was nevertheless the U.S. Attorney's Office's duty to 
present the defendant's prior history with minors at sentencing. He refused to strike 
the most critical portions of his order. 
Lack of candor to the court is a serious charge, and the judge has quite reasonably 
expressed dismay that the assistant U.S. attorney apparently intended that he never 
be given a full picture of the defendant's conduct, Hakes said. 
But nine months later, in September 2007, Villafaria was in the throes of thorny 
negotiations with Epstein's lawyers. While an FBI investigation was ongoing, 
Villafaria discussed ways to quietly resolve the case, emails show. 
A Miami Herald investigation, -Perversion of Justice, published in November, 
revealed how federal prosecutors, including Acosta and Villafaria, tried to keep the 
full scope of Epstein's crimes out of the public eye. At one point, they discussed 
charging Epstein in Miami, instead of Palm Beach where the crimes happened, 
noting there would be less media coverage. 
Emails also show that prosecutors repeatedly abided by Epstein's lawyers' demands 
that his victims not be told that an agreement had been reached until after he was 
sentenced. That meant that the girls could not appear at the hearing to derail the 
deal. Prosecutors had drafted a 53-page federal indictment on sex trafficking 
charges, but Acosta instead allowed Epstein to plead guilty to two prostitution 
charges in state court. In exchange, Epstein and his co-conspirators were given 
federal immunity. 
Villafaria wrote Epstein's lawyer, Jay Lefkowitz, to discuss the wording of the 
sentencing agreement for the judge: 
I will include all our standard language regarding resolving all criminal liability and 
I will mention co-conspirators, but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all of 
the other crimes and all the other persons we could charge, Villafaria wrote. 
At Epstein's sentencing, assistant Palm Beach prosecutor Lanna Belohlavek was 
questioned by the judge about whether all of Epstein's victims were told about the 
deal, as required by law. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021747 
Are there more than one victim? Circuit Court Judge Deborah Dale Pucillo asked 
Belohlavek at the June 30, 2008 sentencing. 
There's several, Belohlavek replied. 
Are all the victims in both these cases in agreement with the terms of the plea? the 
judge asked. 
Yes, Belohlavek said. 
Coincidentally, the lawyer representing one of the victims was in the courtroom that 
day. He told the Herald that neither he, nor his client, was told about the agreement. 
Acosta has not responded to the Herald's repeated requests for comment. A 
spokesman at the Labor Department told the Washington Post last month: The 
office's decisions were approved by departmental leadership and followed 
departmental procedures. 
In the past, Acosta has said that he believed the deal was the best chance 
prosecutors had of ensuring that Epstein spent some time behind bars and was 
required to register as a sex offender. Epstein served 13 months in the Palm Beach 
County jail — but he was allowed to leave for up to 12 hours a day as part of a work 
release program not normally offered to convicted sex offenders. 
Epstein's victims, now in their late 20S and 30s, are fighting to have his deal 
overturned and Epstein sent to prison. 
Bradley Edwards, who represents several of Epstein's victims, defended Villafaria, 
saying he believed that she was directed to settle the case and not inform Epstein's 
victims about the deal. 
In my conversations with her, I came to believe that she was in a difficult position. 
She never came out and said this, but I suspected that someone above her directed 
her to do what she did, Edwards said.

something that was determined was inappropriate. I honestly don't know who was the victim in this case. I

rational to assume that because you never saw him with an underage girl he must actually be innocent. It is 
possible for a person to be kind and generous with his friends but still a criminal paying for sex with underage

Dear Professor Krauss, 
We met briefly after your talk in Ithaca a few months ago — I'm the girl on The Skeptics' Guide to the 
Universe podcast. I've really enjoyed your talks and books, but I was surprised to see you quoted in the Daily 
Beast recently defending Jeffrey Epstein: 
http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2011-04-01/bill-clinton-katie-couric-woody-allen-jeffrey-
epsteins-society-friends-close-ranks/2/  
Can you confirm if the following quote is accurate? 
If anything, the unfortunate period he suffered has caused him to really think about what he wants to do 
with his money and his time, and support knowledge, says Krauss. Jeffrey has surrounded himself with 
beautiful women and young women but they're not as young as the ones that were claimed. As a scientist I 
always judge things on empirical evidence and he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've 
never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were I would 
believe him over other people. Though colleagues have criticized him over his relationship with Epstein, 
Krauss insists, I don't feel tarnished in any way by my relationship with Jeffrey; I feel raised by it. 
Thanks,

Thomas E. Scott, Jr., Esq.

Re: Edwards and Cassell v. Dershowitz
February 25, 2015

Asserting Privilege for Non-Existent Documents

It is inappropriate to assert a claim of privilege or immunity for non-existent materials.
Greenleaf v. Amerada Hess Corp., 626 So0.2d 263, 264 n.1 (Fla. 4° DCA 1993). We
must assume that the privilege is asserted for a reason, i.e., that responsive and
ostensibly privileged information in fact exists, else the privilege would not have been
asserted. It follows that a privilege log must accompany all such responses.

Claiming Undue Burden for Non-Existent Materials

Likewise, objecting on basis of burdensomeness and later conceding an opponent's right
to materials or later claiming materials do not exist constitute abusive discovery
practices. First Healthcare Corp. v. Hamilton, 740 So.2d 1189, 1194 (Fla. 4 DCA
1999).

Custody, Possession & Control

Fla. R. Civ. P. reaches all documents (broadly defined and specifically including
electronic data) in your client's custody, possession, or control. Custody and
possession are self-explanatory. Control is broader; it means the legal right to obtain,
even from nonparties. The concept of ‘control’ generally has been held to mean the legal
right to obtain the requested documents. Parties thus can be requested to produce
documents in the hands of their attorney, insurer, subsidiary, or another person outside
the jurisdiction of the court. Lawrence M. Watson, Jr. & Michael S. Orfinger, Fla.
Civil Practice Before Trial § 16.60 (1993 ed.) (citing 8 Wright & Miller, Fed. Practice
& Procedure £16-10 (1998 ed.). A recent federal court case construing Fed. R. Civ. P.
41 (on which Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.350 is patterned), explained:

The term control comprehends not only possession but also the right,
authority, or ability to obtain the documents. Accordingly, Rule 34(a)
allows a party seeking discovery to require production of documents
beyond the actual possession of the opposing party if such party has
retained any right or ability to influence the person in whose possession
the documents lie. [A] party is deemed to have control over documents
held on its behalf by its attorneys. A party is also deemed to have control
over financial records of the party that are in the possession of the party's
accountant.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018528.txt,"I understood. Of course I understood. I knew intellectually that it wasn't about me, I knew
it was just about the situations at hand, but of course it hurt anyway. Two awesome men,
giving me the same message at once: This is too much, you're too extreme. A matter of
their boundaries. Not about me. Of course it hurt anyway.

Is there anything else you want to add while we're having this conversation? I asked
The Artist finally, as we wound things up.

He thought for a minute, took my hand. Well, you're wonderful and beautiful, but you
know that.”

Do I? Tasked, and made myself laugh to take the sting from my words.

KOK ok

An aside:

Occasionally, my mother has tried to convince me that I am at emotional risk in part
because of the fact that I am forward about my sexuality. Because -- I think this is how
the story goes, though she's never explicitly articulated it -- because it means that men
will see me as a disposable toy; the hot edgy girl he likes but would never settle down
with; the whore but not the Madonna. Cute enough to catch his attention and passionate
enough that he'll call her back but ultimately, not the keeper, not the girl he'd have any
loyalty to in the end. I think my mom is afraid that I'll stumble out the other end of this
brilliant razor-edged fluorescent beautiful funhouse that is my young and attractive
years, that I'll come down like a girl falling through a distorted mirrored sheet of glass.
That shards will burst everywhere and I'll collapse, covered in metaphorical blood, and
turn my eyes up to the harsh white stars and wonder how I let men use me and why.

This is the stereotype that I think she's afraid of, on my behalf, the one that comes up on
occasion when she comforts me through heartbreak. My mother is hardly a conservative
slut-shamer, but she loves me and she wants to protect me, so she tells me this. And I'll
admit it -- I fear it too, I feel those anxieties whispering behind me, thrumming through
my veins during times like these. What did I mean to him? Did I matter, did I make an
impression, does he give a damn? Would he be willing to Make A Commitment? He
doesn't care, God, I don't matter, and I was just stupid because God forbid I allow myself
to like or trust a man that I fuck, when everyone knows that men don't ever have feelings
for the women they fuck --

But actually those fears don't make sense, do they -- they don't make any sense at all if I
assume that men are complex humans who want to have relationships but aren't always
sure about it (much like myself), rather than sex-seeking-stereotype-activated-robots. The
fears don't make sense in the context of my own experience, which is full of friends and
relatives and lovers who have been caring, self-aware, honest men. The fears don't make
sense given the fact that very often, I'm the one who prefers not to have a serious
relationship right now, or who can only compromise up to a point.

And the fears especially don't make any damn sense if we assume that I want to pursue
my own goals, my own dreams, my own pleasures, my own sexuality on my own terms.
If we assume that I have no intention of playing by the rules in a world that tells me

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017534.txt,"DAVID BROOKS

David Brooks (born August 11, 1961) is a political and cultural
commentator who writes for The New York Times. He worked as
an editorial writer and film reviewer for the Washington Times;
a reporter and later op-ed editor for The Wall Street Journal;

a senior editor at The Weekly Standard from its inception; a
contributing editor at Newsweek and The Atlantic Monthly;

and as a commentator on National Public Radio. He is

now a columnist for The New York Times and commentator

on PBS NewsHour.

Brooks, who is Jewish, was born in Toronto,
Canada—his father was a U.S. citizen living in Canada at the
time—and grew up in New York City in Stuyvesant Town. He
graduated from Grace Church School in New York City, Radnor
High School (located in a Main Line suburb of Philadelphia)
in 1979 and from the University of Chicago, with a degree
in history, in 1983.

Brooks edited a 1996 anthology of writings by
new conservative writers, Backward and Upward: The New
Conservative Writing. He wrote a book of cultural commentary
titled Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They
Got There, published in 2000, and followed it four years later
with On Paradise Drive: How We Live Now (And Always Have)
in the Future Tense.

He also authored The Social Animal: The Hidden
Sources of Love, Character and Achievement. The book was
excerpted in The New Yorker magazine in January 2011
and received mixed reviews upon its full publication, by
Random House, in March of that year. The book has been a
commercial success, reaching the #3 spot on the Publishers
Weekly best-sellers list for non-fiction in April 2011.

Brooks was a visiting professor of public policy at
Duke University’s Terry Sanford Institute of Public Policy, and
he taught an undergraduate seminar there in the fall of 2006.

He and his wife live in the Cleveland Park
neighborhood of Northwest Washington, DC.

Brooks describes himself as being originally a liberal
before “coming to my senses.” In 1983, he wrote a parody
of conservative pundit William F. Buckley Jr., which said
“Tn the afternoons he is in the habit of going into crowded
rooms and making everybody else feel inferior. The evenings
are reserved for extended bouts of name-dropping.”

Buckley admired the parody and offered Brooks
ajob with National Review. A turning point in Brooks’s
thinking came later that year in a televised debate with
Milton Friedman, which, as Brooks describes it, “was
essentially me making a point, and he making a two-
sentence rebuttal which totally devastated my point.”

Before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Brooks argued
forcefully for American military intervention, echoing the
belief of commentators and political figures that American
and British forces would be welcomed as liberators. In the
spring of 2004, some of his opinion pieces suggested that
he had tempered his earlier optimism about the war.

Brooks’ public writing about the U.S. wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq is similar to those by neoconservatives,
according to a Salon article by Glenn Greenwald, that labels
Brooks as a neoconservative. His angry dismissal of the
conviction of Scooter Libby as being “a farce” and having “no

significance” was derided by political blogger Andrew Sullivan.

On August 10, 2006, Brooks wrote a column for The
New York Times titled “Party No. 3”. The column proposed
the idea of the McCain-Lieberman Party, or the fictional
representation of the fictional moderate majority in America.

Ottawa Citizen commentator David Warren has
identified Brooks as the sort of conservative pundit that
liberals like, someone who is “sophisticated” and “engages
with” the liberal agenda, in contrast to a real conservative like
Charles Krauthammer. Brooks has long been a supporter of
John McCain; however, he did not show a liking for McCain’s
2008 running mate, Sarah Palin, calling her a “cancer” on
the Republican Party. He has referred to her as a “joke,”
unlikely to ever win the Republican nomination. But he later
admitted during a CSPAN interview that he had gone too far
in his previous “cancer” comments about Palin, which he
regretted, and simply stated he was not a fan of her values.

In a March 2007 article published in The New
York Times titled “No U-Turns”, Brooks explained that the
Republican Party must distance itself from the minimal-
government conservative principles that had arisen
during the Abraham Lincoln, Barry Goldwater, Ronald
Reagan and Calvin Coolidge eras. He claims that these
core concepts had served their purposes and should
no longer be embraced by Republicans in order to win
elections, which he considers the most important purpose
of a political party designed to serve the political class.

Brooks has been a frequent admirer of President
Barack Obama. In an August 2009 profile of Brooks, The
New Republic describes his first encounter with Obama, in the
spring of 2005: “Usually when I talk to senators, while they
may know a policy area better than me, they generally don’t
know political philosophy better than me. I got the sense he
knew both better than me. [...] remember distinctly an image
of—we were sitting on his couches, and I was looking at his
pant leg and his perfectly creased pant, and I’m thinking,

a) he’s going to be president and b) he’ll be a very good
president.” Two days after Obama’s second autobiography,

The Audacity of Hope, hit bookstores, Brooks published a
column in The New York Times, titled “Run, Barack, Run”,
urging the Chicago politician to run for president. However as
of December 2011 in a CSPAN interview, Brook’s opinion of
Obama’s presidency was more tempered, giving Obama only
a “B-” rating, and said that Obama’s chances of reelection
would be less than 50-50 if elections were held at that time.

In writing for The New York Times in January 2010,
Brooks described Israel as “an astonishing success story”.
He wrote that “Jews are a famously accomplished group,”
who, because they were “forced to give up farming in the
Middle Ages... have been living off their wits ever since”. In
Brooks’ view, “Israel’s technological success is the fruition
of the Zionist dream. The country was not founded so stray
settlers could sit among thousands of angry Palestinians
in Hebron. It was founded so Jews would have a safe place
to come together and create things for the world.”

Brooks opposes what he sees as self-destructive
behavior, such as teenage sex and divorce. His view is that
“sex is more explicit everywhere barring real life. As the
entertainment media have become more sex-saturated,
American teenagers have become more sexually abstemious”
by “waiting longer to have sex...[and] having fewer partners.”
He sees the culture war as nearly over, because “today’s
young people...seem happy with the frankness of the left
and the wholesomeness of the right.” As a result, he
is optimistic about the United States’ social stability,
which he considers to be “in the middle of an
amazing moment of improvement and repair.”

Brooks also broke with many in the conservative
movement when, in late 2003, he came out in favor of same-
sex marriage in his New York Times column. He equated
the idea with traditional conservative values: “We should
insist on gay marriage. We should regard it as scandalous
that two people could claim to love each other and not
wanit to sanctify their love with marriage and fidelity...

It’s going to be up to conservatives to make the important,
moral case for marriage, including gay marriage.”

Regarding abortion, Brooks has advocated for
pro-choice government regulations: abortion should be
legal, with parental consent for minors, during the first four
or five months, and illegal afterward, except in extremely
rare circumstances. (New York Times, April 22, 2002.)

economic retaliation. For example, in June 2018, the Wall Street Journal reported that Xi
warned a group of global CEOs that China would retaliate with “qualitative measures”
targeted at their companies, if the United States did not back off from the tariff war.**
Second, China is seeking to pressure American companies into legitimizing its geopolitical
claims and interests, for example by demanding that Western firms overtly acknowledge
that Taiwan is an irreversible part of China. Third, China has wooed American companies
with both sticks and carrots into serving its strategic interests abroad, most notably via its
interactions with Hollywood.

China’s source of leverage over American companies comes from its large domestic market
and its key role in international supply chains; by contrast, China holds little direct
ownership in American companies. American affiliates (i.e., those at least half-owned by
American multinational companies) employ 1.7 million Chinese workers and are indirectly
responsible for the employment of millions more.* More than fifty American companies
report that they generate at least 20 percent of their revenues from China.*° Naturally,
many companies (and industry associations) with large stakes in China lobby the American
government on issues related to China, often seeking to exert a moderating influence on US
policy. This is not in itself evidence of improper influence, but it merits scrutiny and should
be weighed in the context of other evidence in this section.”

Seeking to Influence American Politics via Corporate Interests

China does, in fact, exert influence on how at least some American companies and
corporate executives interact with the American government. This influence generally
takes two forms. In the first, China relies on American corporations to retard efforts by the
American government to investigate and sanction Chinese behavior deemed harmful to
national economic or strategic interests. For example, some American corporations have
expressed reservations about cooperating with US trade investigations for fear of retaliation
by China.

Chinese officials also regularly convene senior American executives at special meetings
with government officials or major conferences. During these engagements, Western
CEOs’ positive comments on the country receive wide play in the foreign and domestic
media, one of many ways in which the Party continues to seek the appearance of outside
legitimization for domestic purposes. In addition, China uses these meetings to attempt to
coerce American executives to take China’s side in disputes with the US government. As
the risk of a trade war mounted in spring 2018, Chinese officials explicitly warned gathered
executives to lobby the US government to back down or risk disruption to their business
in China.** The US government does not strategically convene foreign business leaders, let
alone instruct them to use their influence to shape policy favorable to the United States in
their home countries.

Dear Jeffrey:

Trust all is well. We are in full pre-production of our “Radical Breakthroughs” series/season for Closer To
Truth. We expect to have a complete production plan, with contributors, locations and schedule, by mid/late
November - when (coincidentally) I will be back in NY.

My next email will add detail, including first (rough) outlines of the first two episodes. I’ll be copying the
producer/director of Closer To Truth, as | will from now on with all reports/communications related to the
content of the series. Whenever we want to communicate privately, about the series/grant or anything else,
please use a separate email (or respond to this one).

Iam in Santa Monica for two weeks, then Beijing for the big Party Congress. I may need to stay until after
Trump’s (supposed) visit. Attached are my two recent BBC commentaries on China (N.Korea bomb and
Myanmar refugees).

Always available to Skype.

I am truly excited about the series - nothing like it, could have impact - and I deeply appreciate your
generosity/support, confidence and trust.

Take care and warm regards,

office of the presidency.”

Haldeman was a saboteur in the guise of a sycophant. In 1967, when
he was a vice president at the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency, he
sent me a long memo on how | could use the media in my‘ 68 campaign.
| have since learned that during World War (Il, various
corporations—Standard Oil, Wrigley Chewing Gum, Paramount
Pictures—lent their services to the Office of Strategic Services, which later
became the CIA. The Thompson Agency supplied Kenneth Hinks to be
chief of the OSS planning staff. One of Haldeman’ s predecessors, Richard
de Rochemont, a vice president of J. Walter Thompson, was offered a
position with the Secret Intelligence Branch of the OSS. Another
Thompson official, Donald Coster, stayed on with the CIA in South Vietnam
from 1959 to 1962.

That’ s when Haldeman really latched on to me, in the ' 62
campaign. And when we lost, it was Haldeman who persuaded me to make
a public fool of myself with that godawful “You won’ t have Nixon to
kick around any more” press conference. It was Haldeman in 1972 who
acted as a double agent and conspired with Dick Tuck to have all those

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015125
"
IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018388.txt,"state can lose many battles, but the only loss that is always fatal is to be defeated in
strategy.”

The leaders of our major global powers may be as blind to the dangers and
possibility of our world as Europe’s heads of states were to the nature of their era
100 years ago. You know what the Seventh Sense is now. Who among them has it?
We should wonder if we’ve merely now done Hiram Maxim one better: Have we
developed something with our age of connection that will reach its fullest potential
in allowing us to slit each other’s throats more efficiently? I don’t think so, but
understanding why means we need consider the networks, to feel them out with our
new sense.

The essential problem of politics is not difficult to state. It was true for Seneca in the
Roman Forum as it was for Lobengula on the Shangani riverbank or is now for
congressmen in Washington or cadres is Beijing: Who has power? Why? By power |
mean the ability to control others, to tell them what to do - or what not to do; and of
course to avoid being dictated to yourself in that “Surrender or die” way. Max
Weber, the German sociologist of the last century, had it right: Macht, the ability to
achieve what you want despite the resistance of others.22? Don’t develop nuclear
weapons. Or Don’t attack us. Or, Join our alliance against Sparta are all examples of
power in action. The movement of power, from the balled-up fists of Kings and
Popes and Emperors, to the hands of markets and voters and citizens, and now into
a fresh, connected dynamic is the story of history. This is a lurching, worrisome,
dangerous process even if it suggests some miraculous transformations. Whole new
topologies of vital, life-giving control are emerging; surely contests for their mastery
will occur. The terrible human infection of a hunger for power and security isn't,
much as we might wish, something quarantined safely to the pages of Homer or
Hitler.

So let’s pass beyond describing the new and surprising elements that make up a
Seventh Sense and onto its use. Examine our world with this instinct, for a moment.
Picture that constantly stretched, complex network, spitting out drones, viruses,
fortunes and disruption as it is wont to do. Recall the seething, insidious power of
the Warez Dudes, the New Caste, the black boxes they all hunger to penetrate and
make weird. Think of the compression of time, of twisting topologies that can place
the distant atop us in an instant. What single feature stands out? Our world shuffles
now, as all these forces slip into an order defined by closed spaces, by fresh in and
out borders. What the Seventh Sense reveals as it feels at this new arrangement is
gates. Everywhere. Facebook, bitcoin users, doctors with privileged access to
genetic databases - all are gated, in-or-out worlds. Look around and see how many
gates enclose you or your family or your company. The Internet. The FTSE 100. Your
Apple or Android operating system. In our connected age, the act of drawing lines

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012954.txt,"38 3 A Patternist Philosophy of Mind

e Evolution , conceived as a general process via which patterns within a large population
thereof are differentially selected and used as the basis for formation of new patterns, based
on some “fitness function” that is generally tied to the goals of the agent

— Example: If trying to build a blocks structure that will surprise Bob, an agent may
simulate several procedures for building blocks structures in its “mind’s eye”, assessing
for each one the expected degree to which it might surprise Bob. The search through
procedure space could be conducted as a form of evolution, via an algorithm such as
MOSES.

e Autopoiesis: the process by which a system of interrelated patterns maintains its integrity,
via a dynamic in which whenever one of the patterns in the system begins to decrease in
intensity, some of the other patterns increase their intensity in a manner that causes the
troubled pattern to increase in intensity again

— Example: An agent’s set of strategies for building the base of a tower, and its set of
strategies for building the middle part of a tower, are likely to relate autopoietically. If
the system partially forgets how to build the base of a tower, then it may regenerate
this missing knowledge via using its knowledge about how to build the middle part
(i.e., it knows it needs to build the base in a way that will support good middle parts).
Similarly if it partially forgets how to build the middle part, then it may regenerate this
missing knowledge via using its knowledge about how to build the base (i.e. it knows a
good middle part should fit in well with the sorts of base it knows are good).

— This same sort of interdependence occurs between pattern-sets containing more than
two elements

— Sometimes (as in the above example) autopoietic interdependence in the mind is tied
to interdependencies in the physical world, sometimes not.

e Association. Patterns, when given attention, spread some of this attention to other pat-
terns that they have previously been associated with in some way. Furthermore, there is
Peirce’s law of mind [Pei34], which could be paraphrased in modern terms as stating that
the mind is an associative memory network, whose dynamics dictate that every idea in
the memory is an active agent, continually acting on those ideas with which the memory
associates it.

— Example: Building a blocks structure that resembles a tower, spreads attention to mem-
ories of prior towers the agents has seen, and also to memories of people the agent knows
have seen towers, and structures it has built at the same time as towers, structures that
resemble towers in various respects, etc.

e Differential attention allocation / credit assignment. Patterns that have been valu-
able for goal-achievement are given more attention, and are encouraged to participate in
giving rise to new patterns.

— Example: Perhaps in a prior instance of the task “build me a surprising structure out of
blocks,” searching through memory for non-blocks structures that the agent has played
with has proved a useful cognitive strategy. In that case, when the task is posed to the
agent again, it should tend to allocate disproportionate resources to this strategy.

e Pattern creation. Patterns that have been valuable for goal-achievement are mutated and
combined with each other to yield new patterns.

THE PALM BEACH POST = «

WEDNESDAY, JULY 26, 2006

Police kept watch on home, airport, sifted through trash

b> EPSTEIN from 1B

suggesting the county’s top
prosecutor disqualify himself.

“I must urge you to ex-
amine the unusual course that
your office’s handling of this

tter has taken and consider

Cz00d and sufficient reason
exists to require your dis-
qualification from the prose-
cution of these cases,” Reiter
wrote in a May 1 memo to
Krischer.

While not commenting
specifically on the Epstein
case, Mike Edmondson,
spokesman for the state at-
torney, said his office pre-
sents cases ‘other than mur-
ders to a grand jury when
there are questions about
witnesses’ credibility and
their ability to testify.

. By the nature of their jobs,
police officers look at evi-
“once from a “one-sided per-
‘\wwpective,” Edmondson said.
“A prosecutor has to look at it
in a much broader fashion,”
weighing the veracity of wit-
nesses and how they may fare
‘under defense attorneys’
questioning, he said.

Epstein’s attorney, Jack
Goldberger, said his client
committed no crimes.

“The reports and _ state-
ments in question refer to
false accusations that were
not charged becatise the Palm
Beach County state attorney
questioned the credibility of
the witnesses,” Goldberger

said. A county grand jury
“found the allegations wholly
unsubstantiated and not
credible,” and that’s why his
client was not charged with
sexual activity with minors,
he said.

Goldberger said Epstein
passed a lie detector test ad-
ministered by a reputable

‘ polygraph examiner in which

he said he did not know the

‘girls were minors. Also, a

search warrant served. on
Epstein’s home found no evi-
dence to corroborate the
girls allegations, Goldberger

According to police docu-
ments:

g@ A Palm Beach Commu-
nity College student said she
gave Epstein a massage in the
nude, then brought him six
girls, ages 14 to 16, for mas-
sage and sex-tinged sessions
at his home.

@A 27-year-old woman
who worked as. Epstein’s
personal assistant also facili-
tated the liaisons, phoning
the PBCC student to arrange
for girls when Epstein was
coming to town. And she es-
corted the girls upstairs when
they arrived, putting fresh
sheets on amassage table and
placing massage oils nearby.

@ Police took sworn
statements from five alleged
victims and 17 witnesses.
They contend that on three
occasions, Epstein had sex
with the girls. ~ .

The chief's letter

See the letter Paim Beach Police
Chief Michael Reiter wrote to
State Attomey Bary Krischer

on the Epstein case.

PaimBeachPost.com

A money manager for the
ultra-rich, Epstein was named
one of New York’s most eligi-
ble bachelors in 2003 by The
New York Post. He reportedly
hobnobs with the likes of
former President Clinton,
former Harvard University
President Lawrence Sum-
mers and Donald Trump, and
has lavish homes in Manhat-
tan, New Mexico and the Vir-

‘gin Islands.

He has contributed tens of
thousands of dollars to Dem-
ocratic Party candidates and
organizations, including Sen.
John Kerry’s presidential bid,
and the Senate campaigns of
Joe Lieberman, Hillary Clin-
ton, Christopher Dodd and

Charles Schumer.

Goldberger is one of five
attorneys Epstein has re-
tained since he became the

subject of an investigation,

Edmondson said. Among the
others: Alan Dershowitz, the
well-known Harvard law pro-
fessor and author, who is a
friend of Epstein. Dershowitz
could not be reached for
comment. _

Police said the woman
who enlisted young girls for

Epstein was Haley Robson,’

20, of Royal Palm Beach.
Robson has worked at an O1-
ive Garden restaurant in
Wellington and said she wasa
journalism major at Palm
Beach Community College
when she was questioned by
police last October. She has
an unlisted phone number
and could not be reached for
comment.

Robson said she met Ep-
stein when, at age 17, a friend
asked her if she would like to
make money giving him a
massage. She said she was
driven to his five-bedroom,
7%bath home on the Intra-
coastal Waterway, then es-
corted upstairs to a bedroom
with a massage table and oils.
Epstein and Robson were
both naked during the mas-
sage, she said, but when he
grabbed her buttocks, she
said she didn’t want to be
touched.

Epstein said he’d pay her
to bring him more girls — the
younger the better, Robson
told police. When she tried
once to bring a 23-year-old
woman to him, Epstein said
she was too old, Robson said.

Robson, who has not been
charged in the case, said she
eventually brought six girls to
Epstein who were paid $200
each time, Robson said. “I'm
like a Heidi Fleiss,” police
quoted her as saying. The
girls knew what to expect

_ when they were taken to Ep-

stein’s home, Robson said.

Give a massage — maybe na-
ked — and allow some
touching.

One 14-year-old girl Rob-
son.took to meet Epstein led
police to start the investiga-
tion of him in March 2005. A
relative of the girl called to say
she thought the child had re-
cently engaged in sex with a
Palm Beach man. The girl
then got into a fight with a
classmate who accused her of
being a prostitute, and she
couldn’t explain why she had
$300 in her purse.

The girl gave police this.

account of her meeting with
Epstein:

She accompanied Robson
and a second girl to Epstein’s
house on a Sunday in Febru-
ary 2005. Once there, a wom-
an she thought was Epstein’s
assistant told the girl to follow
her upstairs to a room featur-
ing amural of anaked woman,
several photographs of naked
women on a shelf, a hot pink
and green sofa and amassage
table.

She stripped to her bra:
and panties and gave him a .

massage.

Epstein gave the 14-year-
old $300 and she and the oth-
er girls left, she said. She said
Robson told her that Epstein
paid her $200 that day.

Other girls told similar
stories. In most accounts,
Epstein’s personal assistant at
the time, Sarah Kellen, now
27, escorted the girls to Ep-

stein’s bedroom.

Kellen, whose most re-
cent known address is in
North Carolina, has not been
charged in the case.

Palm Beach police often
conducted surveillance of
Epstein’s home, and at Palm
Beach International Airport
to see if his private jet was
there, so they would know
when he was in town. Police
also arranged repeatedly to .
receive his trash from Palm
Beach sanitation workers,
collecting papers with names
and phone numbers, sex toys
and female hygiene products.

. One note stated that a fe-
male could not come over at 7
p.m. because of soccer. An-
other said a girl had to work
Sunday — “Monday after
school?” And _ still another
note contained the work
hours of a girl, saying she
leaves school at 11:30 a.m.
and would come over the next
day at 10:30 a.m.

Only three months before
the police department probe
began, Epstein donated
$90,000 to the department for
the purchase of a firearms
simulator, said Jane Struder,
town finance director. The
purchase was never made.-
The money was returned to
Epstein on Monday, she said.

USA Inc.’s expenses far exceed revenue — and government
projections imply this trend will get worse, not better.

In addition - while not addressed in depth in this presentation - USA Inc.
(while still a global powerhouse), at the margin, is losing competitive
advantage to many other countries.

Instead of ignoring the problems, we simply ask the question...

How would a financial / turnaround expert look at USA Inc.’s financials,
business model, strategic plans, efficiency and aim to drive the
‘business’ to break-even (or a modest profit) over the next

5-10 years?

KP
www.kpcb.com USA Inc. | What Might a Turnaround Expert Consider? 233

Matching Expenses & Revenue:

Imperatives & Constraints

There are many reasons to make changes
— USA Inc. is losing money, and forecasts imply it will continue to lose money.

— Net debt levels (62% in F2010) are expected to surpass 90% threshold* — above
which real GDP growth could slow by more than one percentage point — by 2021E.

Spending (primarily related to entitlement programs) is at unsustainable levels
based on USA Inc.'s ability to fund the spending (without increasing debt levels).

— Americans rank ‘reducing America’s debt’ as one of country’s top priorities,
according to a national survey by Peter G. Peterson Foundation in 11/09.

— We are now in the midst of a major generational baton-passing (from the Baby
Boomers to Generation X) which requires preparation for policy change.

— Foreigners own 46% (and rising) of USA Inc.’s debt, per Treasury Department —
Are they going to keep funding USA Inc.’s spending?

Note: *Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff observed from 3,700 historical annual data points from 44 countries that the relationship between government debt
and real GDP growth is weak for debt/GDP ratios below a threshold of 90 percent of GDP. Above 90 percent, median growth rates fall by one percent, and average
growth falls considerably more. We note that while Reinhart and Rogoff’s observations are based on ‘gross debt’ data, in the U.S., debt held by the public is closer
to the European countries’ definition of government gross debt. For more information, see Reinhart and Rogoff, “Growth in a Time of Debt,” 1/10.

designer of a course on how to manage a restaurant must focus on
the typical goal conflict situations that a new manager would have to
confront. The course designer must create a fictional situation where
it is necessary to convince an employee to do something or to find out
why something that was asked of an employee did not happen.

The magic word is scenario. Scenarios are like plays. Things happen
and you have to deal with them. A well-written scenario makes sure
that all of the processes that could be at all relevant to what you want
to teach, occur in this new context. In a reasonable education system,
students would have been practicing all of these processes all of their
lives. But we do not have a reasonable education system. We have
one based in subjects. So our cognitive processes are not rehearsed
over time in different contexts by constant practice. Instead we learn
knowledge about subjects.

To remedy this, a course designer (and a teacher if the teacher has
that freedom) must make sure that as many of the cognitive processes
as are relevant to a situation naturally occur within the scenario being
constructed to simulate what will happen in real life later on. Not ev-
ery situation requires diagnosis, but many do. Not every situation has
a goal conflict or forces one to make predictions or plans, but many
do. If what needs to be taught naturally lends itself to working on
any of the 12 cognitive processes, then the training being built must
concentrate on that. If there could be diagnosis, then there should be
training in diagnosis in that context, and that training must supersede
the garnering of facts.

Schools are tough to change. We are trying, but the subject-based
educators have a few hundred years head start. However, in designing
new training, it is quite possible to reorient subject-based courses and
turn them into cognitive process-based courses that are much more
satisfying to both the teacher and the student.

Over the next two years, we believe that the beverage category can grow to a $900 mm
revenue opportunity. Our conviction in this category is underscored by our proprietary
consumer survey, which shows that almost 20% of CBD users consume beverages,
which we view as an encouraging sign. For 2019, we are forecasting a notable
acceleration in growth, with revenues more than doubling to $600 mm. Assuming
growth moderates in 2020 (to 50%), we believe revenues will approach the $1 bn mark.

and wellness and we believe that CBD-infused energy drinks will represent a niche
segment in a category that continues to see more competition. We expect CBD beer to
have a place in the category, though should admittedly be smaller in scale, given less
interest from a lack of THC.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027914.txt,"During the exercise, Meir said nothing at all. I couldn’t help wondering
whether, despite our nearly daily exercises, and my nightly stock-taking, I'd
somehow missed an obvious detail in our planning. When we got back to the
sayeret base, Avraham was waiting for us. “Well?” he asked Meir. “They don’t
need me,” he said. “They know what they’re doing.” It was not just a source of
reassurance for me, but a huge relief for Avraham.

The team I’d inherited from Tubul included three gifted soldiers with
different backgrounds, and different skills. Motti Nagar was born in Cairo. He
was short but solidly built, smart, level-headed and almost always smiling. Kuti
Sharabi grew up in a Yemeni family in an impoverished neighborhood in Tel
Aviv. He had a self-deprecating sense of humor, a quick mind and sometimes
even quicker tongue, but an extraordinary ability to focus on the task at hand.
The third member was a kibbutznik. His name was Moshe Elimelech. We called
him Moshiko. Utterly self-contained, a man who spoke only when absolutely
necessary, he also brought two different qualities to the mission. One was going
to be indispensable: an almost squirrel-like ability to climb trees. Or telephone
poles. The other, of which I was a bit more leery, was a total, deeply irrational,
absence of fear.

Though none of us needed a further reminder of the weight being attached to
our mission, the night before we headed north, Avraham got a call from the
chief-of- staff's office. Tzvi Tzur wanted to see me the next morning for a
personal briefing. I tried to get Avraham to say no. I pointed out that if we
didn’t get going by ten o’clock at the latest, we’d risk throwing everything off
schedule. But “no” was not an option. After some further back-and-forth, it was
agreed that I would meet the commander of Israel’s armed forces at nine the
next morning at a gas station north of Tel Aviv and join him for the 20-minute
drive along the coastal road to a speaking engagement he had in Netanya.

I saw Avraham again before I set off. “We are beginning an extremely
critical 24 hours for our unit, the intelligence corps, in fact for the armed forces
as a whole,” he told me. “I don’t know what might happen. No one does. Just
remember two things. First, out there, in the field, you are the ramatkal” — the
chief of staff. He told me that only I and my team could judge and respond to
what we encountered once the operation started. “And second, this mission has
to be accomplished.”

I left see the real ramatkal. Before we began the drive to Netanya, he asked
me to unfold the map I'd brought with me and talk him through, step by step,
how we planned to get onto the Golan, plant the bugging device, and get back

TAL Cannabis Investment Report | December 2017

w U.S. State Law

Of the 51 jurisdictions comprising the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, 47 have enacted
at least one law that permits the manufacturing, distribution, dispensing or possession of cannabis or
concentrates. These laws fall into three general categories:

¢ 29 USS. states and the District of Columbia have enacted medical cannabis laws that permit
the production and possession of cannabis or concentrates for use in treating a broad range of
qualifying medical conditions,

° 19 U.S. states have enacted narrow CBD/limited laws that permit possession of small amounts
of low-THC/high-CBD cannabis concentrates for use in treating a few serious medical condi-
tions—in particular, severe forms of childhood epilepsy.

° 8 USS. states have enacted recreational laws that permit the commercial production and sale of
cannabis to adults for recreational and other uses.

Some states have passed more than one of these laws, and some state laws do not fall clearly into
any one of these categories. Florida and Delaware have both medical cannabis and CBD/limited laws.
Every state that has enacted a recreational law has also passed a medical cannabis law. A District of
Columbia law that permits adults to grow and consume cannabis is often cited as a recreational law;
however, we do not characterize it as such because it does not permit the commercial production and
sale of cannabis. The following map of the United States shows states with medical cannabis laws,
CBD /limited laws or recreational laws (a state with more than one of these laws is represented on the
map by its most permissive law).

multimillionaire New York hedge fund manager.

Marra stopped short of voiding the agreement, which granted Epstein and an untold number of accomplices
immunity from federal prosecution for sex trafficking crimes, provided Epstein plead guilty to minor charges in state
court. At the time of the plea deal, federal prosecutors had gathered enough evidence against Epstein to write a 53-

page federal indictment, court records show.

The story behind a Palm Beach sex offender’s remarkable deal

The story behind a Palm Beach sex offender’s remarkable deal

Emily Michot

An investigation by the Miami Herald, “Perversion of Justice,’’ found that after Acosta met privately with one of
Epstein’s lawyers, the government agreed to seal the plea agreement so that no one — not the victims, not even the
state court judge who sentenced Epstein — would know the full extent of his crimes. Epstein, now 66, was allowed
to plead guilty to prostitution charges and served 13 months in the Palm Beach County jail, where he was given
liberal work release, and allowed to travel to New York and his private island in the Caribbean during his
subsequent house arrest. He was released in 2009, and now divides his time between New York, Palm Beach and the
U.S. Virgin Islands.

The Herald interviewed four of Epstein’s victims, who were as young as 13 at the time they were abused by Epstein.
They said they felt betrayed by state and federal prosecutors, who treated them like prostitutes instead of victims.
Two of them sued the federal government in 2008 under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, which grants crime victims

the right to be informed about plea deals and to confer with prosecutors.

Marra, in a 33-page opinion, said prosecutors not only intentionally violated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, but they
misled the girls into believing that the FBI’s sex trafficking case against Epstein was ongoing — when, in fact,

prosecutors had secretly closed it after sealing the plea bargain from the public record.

Marra, noting that he reviewed affidavits, depositions and interrogatories, said “Epstein worked in concert with

others to obtain minors not only for his own sexual gratification, but also for the sexual gratification of others.’’

The victims’ attorneys — Edwards, Scarola and Paul Cassell — have asked the Justice Department to throw out

Epstein’s plea agreement and reopen the criminal investigation.

Edwards, who brought the victims’ rights case against the government, said transferring the case to another

jurisdiction is a prudent decision.

COLLABORATIVE INSIGHTS

Figure 18 Interest Broad Based from Edibles...

February 25, 2019

Consumer Products Opportunities (Azer)

In 2018, the CBD market in the U.S. has been estimated to have generated revenues
ranging from ~S600 mm to as much as $2 bn. In our 2019 global cannabis outlook
report (here), we had believed the CBD purchases in the U.S. likely skewed to the lower-
end of that range. However, with new survey data from Cowen’s proprietary consumer
survey, we can see that among our ~2,500 respondents (18+) in January 2019 nearly 7%
reported using CBD as a supplement. Coupled with the diverse form factors reportedly
being used (including close to 20% for beverages, which was surprising to us), we are
now inclined to size the current market at closer to $2 bn.

Indeed, looking at Google search trends, we can see that interest looks to have climbed
steadily in 2016 and 2017, and accelerated meaningfully in 2018, which has continued
into 2019.

Encouragingly, interest has been rising consistently among different form factors,
ranging from supplements like CBD gummies, to topicals and oils. The rising interest and
popularity in this broad range of CBD offerings should support a diverse category and
multiple competitors that cater to a large base of consumers with different needs,
requiring various applications.

postscript: the need to negotiate the final five to ten miles, through open desert,
and to find the right area, on our side of a border that wasn’t even marked.
“Can’t any of you,” he barked, “lead a convoy of a few dozen trucks?”

I’m not sure what possessed me. But I thought to myself: yes, I probably
can. I had been scouting and navigating in one way or another since those first
evenings with Yigal in the kibbutz orchards. I’d trained with Gadna Sayerim.
And while I’d never lived in the south, the farm settlement of Patish, where I’d
worked along with Yigal after getting kicked out of high school, was not far
from the route the conveys would have to take.

So I raised my hand.
“Can you lead a convoy?” he asked.
“Yes, sir,” I said. “Of course, Pll need a map. And a compass.”

“Why do you think you’re qualified?” he prodded. I’d been in Gadna
Sayerim, I said. | was good with maps. “Okay,” he replied, and he sent me,
along with two of the company’s junior officers, to the battalion commander.

Someone must have phoned ahead, because he was clearly expecting us.
Still, I could see the surprise in his eyes when he looked at me: only just
eighteen, but looking closer to 15, my uniform sagging on my slender frame. He
gazedat the officers, then back at me, then at the officers again, as if trying to
figure out whether he was about to approve something utterly crazy. But he had
little choice. Three convoys had to be dispatched within the next couple of
hours. So far, with me, he had a sum total of one guy to lead them. “Fine,” he
said, and waved us out.

The column consisted of eight huge, American-made six-wheelers, each
packed with ten tons of munitions and other supplies. I was in the lead truck.
The driver was a reservist in his mid-30s. So were most of the men in the rest of
the transport trucks, one driver and one soldier in each. A staff sergeant, in the
second vehicle, was in theoretical command. But, surreal though it felt, I was
actually in charge, since I was the only person who might, conceivably, get us
to the right place.

The platoon commander was right. The first part, on paved roads, was fairly
easy. But just before sunset, we reached open desert, the beginning of more than
three hours of picking and weaving, calibrating and recalibrating, our way

it, we will go through some more background regarding human-like intelligence (in the rest
of this chapter), philosophy of mind (in Chapter 3) and contemporary AGI architectures (in
Chapter4).

2.3 Further Characterizations of Humanlike Intelligence

We now present a few complementary approaches to characterizing the key aspects of human-
like intelligence, drawn from different perspectives in the psychology and AI literature. These
different approaches all overlap substantially, which is good, yet each gives a slightly different
slant.

2.3.1 Competencies Characterizing Human-like Intelligence

First we give a list of key competencies characterizing human level intelligence resulting from
the the AGI Roadmap Workshop held at the University of Knoxville in October 2008 ', which
was organized by Ben Goertzel and Itamar Arel. In this list, each broad competency area is
listed together with a number of specific competencies sub-areas within its scope:

Perception: vision, hearing, touch, proprioception, crossmodal

Actuation: physical skills, navigation, tool use

Memory: episodic, declarative, behavioral

Learning: imitation, reinforcement, interactive verbal instruction, written media, experi-
mentation

Reasoning: deductive, abductive, inductive, causal, physical, associational, categorization
Planning: strategic, tactical, physical, social

Attention: visual, social, behavioral

Motivation: subgoal creation, affect-based motivation, control of emotions

Emotion: expressing emotion, understanding emotion

Self: self-awareness, self-control, other-awareness

Social: empathy, appropriate social behavior, social communication, social inference, group
play, theory of mind

12. Communication: gestural, pictorial, verbal, language acquisition, cross-modal

13. Quantitative: counting, grounded arithmetic, comparison, measurement

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029160.txt,"Sickle cell DISEASE by contrast refers to an individual with two sickle genes and this
is a serious condition since there is extensive sickling in a person who is otherwise
normal and lacks, for example, malaria. The survival rate of such individuals in
Jamaica (where 10% of the population have a sickle gene and 1% two copies) is 57
years, a good 10+ years below normal—nor is life pleasant or easy. This is the only
crudity in the same, the failure to ameliorate the negative effects of two copies.

It is correct as Peter says, that relatively recent human invasion by malaria
(~10,000 years ago) was probably in response to large population increases due to
agriculture and so on. This short time period has also prevented much selection to
ameliorate the sickle cell disease. It is not true, however, that “it and many other
crude adaptations” result from the “ability of the malarial parasites to outwit the
immune system”. First of all, other “adaptations” are no more crude than the sickle
trait. For example, the Duffy antigen, a surface protein on red blood cells, is designed
to spot Plasmodium and prevent entry. And the parasite does not “outwit the
immune system”. It is one of the very few Protozoa (or for that matter bacteria) that
live WITHIN cells and thus escape the immune system entirely (except see below).
Viruses live inside cells, precisely why we can’t use antibiotics against them.

And here is a joke for you. Bacteria, as we know, are rapidly evolving resistance to
almost all antibiotics but on many tips of the branches of the bacterial bush, species
are evolving that DEPEND on antibiotics for their food—stop treating them with
antibiotics and they die of hunger!

Plasmodium reproduces within its red blood cell and the offspring are released into
the blood as the cell bursts. Now the immune system responds strongly and all hell
breaks loose, fever and chills, bed-ridden and sometimes dead. When given a choice,
mosquitos preferentially bite sick people, perhaps because they are too weak to
swat the mosquitos away. Once in a mosquito, they do nothing to harm it other than
congregate in its mouth near the biting organ, the better to arrive new human.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011029.txt,"This observation helps clarify my hypothesis that job learning costs no time that
might otherwise have been spent earning pay. My deeper meaning is that invested
learning and maintenance learning are the same process costing the same time but
with different economic effect, much as with invested and maintenance

consumption.

Evidence that hourly if not yearly pay rises until retirement, or very near, would
refute Ben-Porath’s claim if human capital ended at retirement. But it continues

through retirement because imputed pay does.

Mill and a few economists before him acknowledged “productive” and
“unproductive” consumption. The productive kind was what I call maintenance and
invested consumption. Unproductive consumption meant any written invested for

higher pay later nor supporting survival pay now. That would give

pure consumption = maintenance consumption + unproductive consumption (5.8)

and

consumption = invested consumption + pure consumption
= invested consumption + maintenance consumption

+ unproductive consumption. (5.9)

Investment and maintenance contrast in human capital as in a firm. Investment is
valued only in the expectation of future maintenance. No maintenance later, no
value now. To count maintenance as new investment would count part of the old
investment twice. Where the accounting treatments differ is in disposition.
Maintenance in the firm is recovered in pay and products. | thought before that the
same was true of human capital. Thanks to the parable of the boss and her secretary,

I now I think it is exhausted in satisfying our taste for lineage survival.

View this email in your browser here. 
Chart of the Day - Economy and Society 
June 27, 2016 
Dear Barry, 
When it comes to describing Donald Trump's private jet, the word 
impressive would be an understatement. The presumptive Republican Party 
nominee bought the Boeing 757-200 from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen 
and he spared no expense kitting it out. Dubbed Trump Force One, the 
luxurious jet is equipped with a shower, gold-plated seatbelt buckles and a 
52-inch flatscreen with a library of 1,000 movies. Built in 1991, the 757 is 
estimated to have cost approximately $100 million. If Trump reaches the 
White House in November, he'll have to exchange his personal jet for the 
presidential fleet, two highly modified Boeing 747-200Bs. The aircraft used by 
the president were built in 1986 and operate with the Air Force One callsign 
when the president is onboard. Will switching jets prove one of Trump's few 
regrets if he becomes president? 
Even though it cannot boast gold-plated accessories, Air Force One is a 
larger aircraft, seating 70 passengers in comfort compared to Trump Force 
..11141, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033301 
One's 43. The presidential jet is also slightly faster with a range of about 
6,800 nautical miles compared to 4,100 for a 757. A VC-25A can also be 
refuelled in mid-air by a tanker, extending its range even further. 
The two presidential planes cost $325 million each and their cost of operation 
comes to $179,750 per hour. The hourly cost of operation for a standard 757 
is just over $8,000 by comparison, though the taxpayer will pick up the higher 
bill for Air Force One. All that bling certainly inflated the cost of Trump Force 
One but Air Force One is expensive because it's packed with equipment and 
facilities to keep the president and his or her entourage safe at all times. 
There is a hospital onboard, electronic countermeasures and heavy shielding 
to afford protection in the event of an electromagnetic pulse during a nuclear 
attack. All in all, if Trump does end up travelling regularly on Air Force One, 
he probably won't regret trading in his gold seatbelt buckle for the presidential 
suite on one of the most sophisticated airliners in the world.

The Fed turns more hawkish, though vol remains subdued

Last week, unsurprisingly the Fed opted to hike benchmark rates another 25bps.
However, the market was more focused on the FOMC’s unexpectedly hawkish message,
which indicated that it is willing to normalize policy despite weaker-than-desired
inflation. Qur economists now think the Fed will announce balance sheet normalization
in September and will hike rates again in December. A more hawkish Fed could result in
higher real rates and a stronger USD, which ultimately should benefit our Growth to
Value rotation trade of long XLF calls versus short QQQ calls (see Chart 15). The S&P
500 was more-or-less flat week-over-week as it gained only 6bps. The tech selloff
continued, however, and the Nasdaq-100 dropped 105bps. Similarly, the Russell 2000
also dropped 105bps. Despite concerns on the Fed, the VIX fell 0.32 vol points to 10.38,

and SPX 1m ATM implied vol declined 0.3 vol points to 7.6%.

On June 9, the Nasdaq dropped nearly 2% as investors unwound
crowded positions, resulting in a sudden selloff from a period of
relative calm. However, despite the volatility among tech names
during the first week of June, the Nasdaq (CCMP} has not seen a
5% drawdown from a prior peak (using closing data} in 150
days. This is the longest such streak in the Nasdaq’s history.

Prior to today, the longest periods of similar calm occurred
during July ’83 and July ’86, when the index did not record a 5%
drawdown from a peak in 136 and 135 days respectively.

Last week the S&P 500 recorded its 11 session without a
move larger than 0.5% in either direction. As a result, 10d
realized vol stood at 3.31% as of 16-Jun.

This is already the fourth time this year that SPX has gone more
than 10 consecutive days without a move greater than +/- 0.5%.
This has historically happened only in ’64, ’65 and ’52. The
longest such stretch this year lasted 15 consecutive trading
sessions and ended on 16-May. For comparison, in ’64 SPX had
8 stretches without such a move with the longest stretch
spanning 43 days.

of attention or awareness.

In CogPrime, this moving bubble is achieved largely via economic attention network (ECAN)
equations [GPI~ 10] that propagate virtual currency between nodes and links representing el-
ements of memories, so that the attentional focus consists of the wealthiest nodes and links.
Figures 3.3 and 3.4 illustrate the existence and flow of attentional focus in OpenCog. On the
other hand, in Hameroff’s recent model of the brain [Ham10], the brain’s moving bubble of
attention is achieved through dendro-dendritic connections and the emergent dendritic web.

Expert: Ignorance of age

isn't defense in sex cases

By LARRY KELLER

Palm Beach Post Staff Writer
_ Even if Palm Beach mon-
ey manager Jeffrey Epstein
didn’t know that girls who
police say gave him sexual
massages at his Intracoastal
home were under the legal
age, that alone wouldn’t have
exempted him from criminal
charges of sexual activity with
minors.

“Ignorance is not a valid
defense,” said Bob Dekle, a
legal skills professor who was
a Lake City prosecutor for
nearly 30 years, half of that
time specializing in sex
crimes against children.

“There is no knowledge
element as far as the age is
concerned,” Dekle said.

After an 11-month investi-
gation, Palm Beach .police
said there was probable cause
to charge Epstein, 53, with

CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Fugitive
“Tf I end up in chains in Guantanamo, I can live with that.”

m= —Edward Snowden, Hong Kong

During his interview with Poitras and Greenwald, Snowden said stoically “If I am arrested, I
am arrested.” His fatalistic words notwithstanding, Snowden had made plans to seek a haven
from American justice well before his meeting with journalists in Hong Kong. As early as May
24, 2013, Snowden had suggested to Gellman that he was making arrangements with a foreign
government. To that end, he asked Gellman to insert an encrypted key in Internet version of the
NSA expose that Snowden proposed he write for the Washington Post. He told him the purpose
of the encrypted key was to assist him with a foreign government. Snowden did not identify that
foreign government to Gellman so Gellman knew that Snowden wanted to “seek asylum”
overseas. He decided against assisting him. “I can’t help him evade U.S. jurisdiction—I don’t
want to, and I can’t,” he later explained. “It’s not my job. It’s not the relationship. Iam a
journalist.”

Although Gellman suspected that Iceland might be the foreign government in question,
Snowden, as it turned, had not ever contacted the consulate of Iceland while he was in Hong
Kong. “We had heard nothing from Snowden,” an Iceland government official told Vanity
Fair.

Snowden also did not contact the government of Ecuador in Hong Kong. In late June,
while Harrison was laying down false tracks for Snowden in Hong Kong, Assange in London
asked Fidel Narvaez, who was a friend of his and the legal attaché in the London embassy of
Ecuador, to issue a document that Snowden could use. But this document was not delivered to
Snowden in Hong Kong (and later it was invalidated by Ecuador.) If Snowden had really
planned to go to Ecuador from Moscow, it would require him first going to Cuba. Cuba did not
even require a U.S. passport (as, in 2013, U.S, citizens were not supposed to travel to Cuba.) He
did require a Cuban travel document, which he could have obtained from the Cuban consulate
any time during his month in Hong Kong. Yet he did not ever obtain it. Nor did he acquire a
visa to go to any other country in Latin America or elsewhere. So where was he headed?

Whatever foreign government with which Snowden was dealing earlier in May presumably did
not have an extradition treaty with the United States. Yet few other foreign governments, which
did not have active extradition treaties with the United States, could be directly reached by air.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011001.txt,"We were paying them as homo habilis two million years ago. The cost went up, but
the value of innovation just as much, when homo erectus arrived a little later. Both
rose again with the emergence of Ancestral Eve 200,000 years ago. Adaptation is the
human specialty. Its what gets us through the day. Innovation is adaptation that
happens to become new norms. It started leaving a record of embodied growth
about 50,000 years ago. That doubled pace about 400 years ago. The costs of being
human are the same failure rates and learning curves whether the payoff in
adaptation/innovation means faster gain in good times or slower decline in bad
ones. We row ata Steady stroke, and gain against the shoreline when our new ideas

are particularly good ones and the current is right.

My idea, whether or not Mill’s, is that these costs might be about the same for
breakthroughs or meta-ideas or paradigm shifts as for modest upgrades, or even for
holding even in a world of daily surprises. Ideas trade in an inefficient market. Cost
is dissociated from value, and cause is desynchronized from effect, by the vagaries of

genius and the whim of circumstance.

Now the tougher puzzle. How can consumption keep up with capital even in
accelerations? That’s what Mill described, and that’s what happens. Can Achilles
catch the tortoise even when the tortoise speeds up? Put your money on Achilles.
Here it is Gunnar Myradal to the rescue. The apparent problem is that ex ante
depreciation investment is never enough in acceleration. But the charts and tables
show unanswerably that ex post depreciation investment is. We sow the first, but
reap the second. Plowback of depreciation investment is up to us. Growth is
whatever is added by genius or happenstance. The difference between market value
and cost is sometimes luck, which neither loses nor gains in the long run, but
sometimes imagination. Mother Nature and Gunnar Myrdal simultaneously say
“Shazam”, and convert new ideas into embodied or disembodied growth without

surcharge for the novelty.

Subject: China's dangerous test 
Beijing plans to give its 22 million residents behavioral report cards as China moves toward higher-
intensity monitoring of its entire population. This strategy, similar to those of other Chinese cities, 
has been made easier by mobile technology and existing state restrictions on electronic 
anonymity. Getting an F on this test doesn't mean staying after school, though. The 
consequences can last a lifetime. —David E. Rove/la 
Here are today's top stories 
If there's one thing Americans do well, it's spend. The expectation this holiday shopping season 
is that they will burn through $1 trillion. But save a kind thought for one former king of Christmas: 
This is usually the most wonderful time of the year for gadget maker Apple. Not anymore. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033329 
Apple's helpers aren't feeling joyous, either. Foxconn Technology Group, the biggest assembler 
of iPhones, aims to cut $2.9 billion from expenses in 2019 as it faces  a very difficult and 
competitive year. 
In an extraordinary statement for a U.S. Supreme Court chief justice, John Roberts, an 
appointee of Republican President George W. Bush, criticized the Republican currently in the 
White House for implying a federal judge appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama was 
partisan. U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar this week blocked Donald Trump's latest effort to restrict 
immigration. 
U.S. fossil fuel producers say they expect to fix distribution issues tied to the Permian Basin next 
year, adding three pipelines and as many as 2 million barrels of oil a day. For OPEC, it's a very 
bad dream come true. 
Depressed about that money you just lost in your 401(k)? Don't feel too terrible, as it could have 
been much worse—just ask these guys. Besides, the bleeding finally stopped today as most equity 
benchmarks rose. 
During his time Running Nissan, Carlos Ghosn earned a lot more than his Japanese peers, but 
not nearly as much as other global auto leaders. 
What is Joe Weisenthal thinking about? The Fed. The Bloomberg news director has bad tidings 
for those of you who think the market's recent calamitous behavior might slow planned rate hikes. 
What you'll need to know tomorrow 
• China warns economists on predictions that don't toe the Party's line. 
• Dolce & Gabbana faces China boycott for racist videos. 
• The EU extended a stiff-arm to the U.K. over Sunday Brexit talks. 
• General Electric could be a $41 billion problem for these banks. 
• Scared investors will force Trump to deal on trade, TIAA Bank says. 
• A Boeing 737 narrowly avoided disaster on takeoff from Belfast.

An Unlikely Cure Signals
New Hope for Cancer

How “exceptionalresponders’

‘arerevolutionizing treatment

for the deadly desease

BY KAT MCGOWAN

UST LIKE EVERY NEW drug the oncologists at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center test-
ed against bladder cancer in the last 20 years,
this one didn’t seem to be doing any good. For-
ty-four people in the study were given everolimus in a
last-ditch attempt to slow down or stop their advanced
cancer. When the researchers analyzed the data, they
could see that the drug wasn’t slowing or stopping
tumor growth. Everolimus seemed to be another bust.
Then there was patient number 45. She joined the
trial with advanced metastatic cancer. Tumors had
invaded deep into her abdomen, clouding her CT scan
with solid grey blotches. She was 73 years old. None of
the standard bladder cancer drugs were working for
her anymore; she had “failed treatment,” in the dismal
lingo of oncologists. She enrolled in the study only
because she happened to be a patient at Sloan-Ketter-
ingin January 2010. In April 2010, her cancer was gone.
This sort of happy surprise is not unheard of

in drug studies. Bodies are fluky, each with its own

idiosyncratic combination of genetic blueprints and

J

environmental inputs. So sometimes a patient will be
cured by a drug that is useless for everyone else. In
the past, these spectacular reactions were written off
as outlier responses that defied explanation—medical
mysteries. Doctors just shrugged their shoulders and
thanked their lucky stars that even though the study
tanked, they did manage to help one person.

But this time was different. Clinical oncologist
David Solit, director of developmental therapeutics
at Sloan-Kettering, saw a new opportunity to explain
what happened by sequencing the whole genome of
the woman’s cancer. Just five years ago, decoding and
analyzing all 3 billion bases of the DNA from a tumor
would’ve been absurdly time-consuming and expen-
sive. Now the sequencing takes as little as a few days.

Poring over the outlier patient’s genetic code, Solit
pinpointed two mutations that made her tumor sensi-
tive to this drug. He found that one of her mutations
shows up in about 8 to 10 percent of other bladder can-
cer patients, meaning that they too might be helped
by everolimus. His success has inspired a whole set of

exposing how Epstein and his lawyers had corrupted the legal system to obtain the NPA and
referring to Dershowitz’s sexual abuse of Roberts. Dershowitz’s response on behalf of himself
and his client and co-conspirator Epstein has been a desperate barrage of false and increasingly
defamatory attacks on Roberts. The purpose and effect of these attacks has been to damage
Robert’s reputation and credibility and to try to intimidate her into silence.

14. Defendant’s central assertion is that Roberts has committed perjury, and that in
December 2014, Roberts and her attorneys hatched a scheme to falsely accuse Dershowitz of sex
trafficking as part of a criminal attempt to extort a settlement from another party.

15. As Defendant and Epstein well knew, Dershowitz’s assertion was false.
Dershowitz and Epstein knew that Dershowitz had in fact had sex with Plaintiff. Dershowitz and
Epstein also knew that Roberts’s assertions about Dershowitz were not part of any criminal
extortion plot. Indeed, Dershowitz and Epstein knew that Roberts had identified Dershowitz as a
sexual predator years before December 2014.

16. Defendant’s knowledge of the falsity of his attacks on Roberts have not, however,
limited the scope or scale of those attacks.

17. | Examples of Dershowitz’s knowingly false and malicious defamatory statements
made on behalf of himself and Epstein are:

(a) November 28, 2018: “the story was 100% flatly categorically made up” and
“Roberts and her attorneys fabricated the assertion in order to get money from other
powerful, wealthy people”. (Exhibit 1, p. 8).

(b) December 1, 2018: “I never met Roberts; I never had sex with her; she

simply made up the entire story for money”. (Exhibit 2).

Students who complete Algebra II are more than twice as
likely to graduate from college compared to students with less
mathematical preparation.'

The natural assumption here is that we must hurry up and teach
more Algebra II, of course. Except that obviously is not what is going
on; it just serves the interests of those who wrote the report to put it
that way. Here is another statement from that report:

Students who depended on their native intelligence learned less
than those who believed that success depended on how hard
they worked.

The claim is simply this: If you work harder, you get into college.
Now the question is: Why are the writers of this report claiming that
the thing that students have to work harder at is Algebra II?

It is easy enough to see why this panel decided that. At stake was a
$100 million federal budget request for Math Now, and the people who
were on the panel were people who would receive that funding. Uni-
versity professors issue reports asking for grant money to be approved
that state that the nation will not succeed without that grant money.
Vested interests are nothing new. I am sometimes amazed that no one
points this stuff out, however. It is well established that everyone must
know algebra. The fact that this is well established by those who make
money on the teaching of algebra is never brought up by the New York
Times, which published a lead article on the report, or by anyone else,
it seems.

My favorite part of the Times article was the following:

Dr. Faulkner, a former president of the University of Texas at
Austin, said the panel “buys the notion from cognitive science
that kids have to know the facts.”

Dr. Faulkner, let me point out, is a chemist, and I am pretty sure
he doesn’t really know much about cognitive science. But cognitive
science has been used of late to justify a great deal of what is wrong
in education. E.D. Hirsch, an English professor at the University of
Virginia, made a career of making lists of stuff every kid should know.
When cognitive scientists trashed this work as nonsense, he cited the

The below figure reflects the notable competition seen within vape as more companies
continue to enter the space. In addition to CBD only-focused companies, we are starting
to see crossover from adult-use / medical focused companies including Green Thumb
Industries and Curaleaf Hemp. Indeed, GTI recently announced the acquisition of Beboe,
which will offer a CBD vape pen with a focus on gaining distribution in high-end retail
stores. Curaleaf will offer their pen through its e-commerce platform and dispensaries.

Notably, crossover does not pertain solely to cannabis companies, as Turning Point
Brands recently announced a minority stake in CASH, a privately held CBD extraction
and production company. With a rapidly growing vapor infrastructure in place already
(from Vapor Beast, Vapor Shark and Vapor Supply), TPB has a number of avenues and
distribution points, both B2B and B2C, to introduce CBD vapor products to complement
its portfolio. As such, we look for new CBD product introductions from TPB over the
next year, with vapor as a logical entry point and key focus area.

stayed with the cart while the other four outlined a landing area with kerosene
flares in the hope that the pilot would see us. It was another five minutes when
we heard the thump of chopper blades. Though we couldn’t see more than a few
feet, I suddenly saw the outline of the landing gear and then the underbelly. But
the helicopter did not seem in control. It was drifting towards where I was
standing with the cart. It was just seconds away from hitting me when its nose
wrenched upward. It landed with a judder a dozen yards away. Later, I learned
the navigator had realized the craft was drifting and, just before impact, shouted
a warning to the pilot.

We piled in, secured the cart and took off. Within a minute, the murky
blanket of fog was below us. As we swooped back into Israel, I could see the
first pink of sunrise. By the time we touched down at Tel Nof air force base,
southeast of Tel Aviv, the command post in the Negev was receiving the first
intercepts.

A few days later, one of the sayeret soldiers gave me a first-hand insight into
the mood in the command post in the final stages of the operation. Avsha
Horan’s role had been to act as security guard for the top brass in Mount Keren.
He occasionally took a peek inside. He described to me the atmosphere when I
radioed my “milk is coming” message: solemn faces, hushed conversations
between Avraham and Meir Amit. And off to the side, the recently elevated
chief-of-staff, Rabin, chain-smoking and biting his nails. Finally, the audible
sighs of relief when the pilot radioed in with his final message from the
chopper: “Out of the fog. Heading home.”

With the rest of the team, I was invited to see Yitzhak Rabin ten days later.
We were being given a further tzalash. This was the first time I'd met him since
leaving officers’ school two years earlier, when, with a few terse words, the
then-deputy chief of staff congratulated me and several other cadets who
graduated with top honors. I had felt a bit overwhelmed in his presence. Now, I
was struck by how shy he seemed. He greeted each of us with a tentative
handshake, and seemed uncomfortable in making eye contact. Yet once he
began asking me about the Sinai operation itself, it was as if he was
transformed. He was hungry for every detail, anxious to know the way we’d had

touched as well by the fact that he had decided to “pass the torch” to me, someone
more in the mold, and closer to, Rabin. But I remained cautious, too. When I got
back home, Nava, knowing where I’d been, was still awake. I told her everything
that Shimon had said. I told her how extraordinary it felt to have the prospect, at
least, of leading Labor in opposition to Bibi, without the need to confront, or to
inflict personal hurt, on Shimon. But I added: “It seems a bit too good to be true.”

It was. The next morning, I joined other ministers and party officials with Peres
in his office. It was as if our conversation a few hours before had never happened.
Shimon set out his strategy for Labor going forward. And the first thing he said
was that the party needed to push back any leadership election beyond the
mandated 14 months.“It’s too early,” he said. He said we needed to focus on two
other strategic imperatives: to reconstruct the party, and consider the issue of
joining a possible “unity” government with Bibi.

Though Bibi went on to form his government without us, in alliance with a
number of smaller Orthodox parties, the idea of a Labor leadership change seemed
off the agenda, at least for now. In early August, I was standing next to Giora Einy
— the “political operative” Yitzhak had sent to help bring me into his government,
and a friend of Peres as well — when Shimon rose to speak to the dozens of well-
wishers at his 73-birthday celebration in Tel Aviv. He was at his old, self-
confident best. With just a few thousand extra votes, we would have won the
election, he said. He was sure Bibi’s coalition — “a coalition against peace” —
would not survive for long. Giora, smiling, turned to me and said: “It doesn’t
sound like a farewell speech. It seems like he’s ready for the next round. He lost
twice to Begin. He lost once to Shamir. And only once to Bibi. He’s not going to
stop without giving it another go.”

Another of Peres’s old friends, a few weeks later, urged me to press him on the
need to step aside. I’d become closer to the French Jewish businessman Jean
Frydman during the election campaign. Since he had helped organize the fateful
peace rally at which Rabin was shot, he felt — wrongly, but powerfully — a sense of
responsibility for what had happened. He wanted to do everything possible to
ensure that Rabin’s political legacy, and Shimon’s, survived. He invited Nava and
me to visit him for a few days. When he asked about the birthday celebration, I
told him what Peres had said. “He’s making a huge mistake,” Jean told me. “After
every election, he goes through the same process. Always, he’s convinced that next
time he will win.” I said how I dreaded the prospect of being part of an effort to

talks with the Americans on the further West Bank redeployments meandered
ahead. We also discussed in detail how a unity government would work. We
agreed it would be presented, like the Shamir-Peres partnership in 1984, as a cross-
party response to an important challenge for the country: in this case, security and
the peace process. I would be both Defense Minister and “Vice-Prime Minister’,
with the understanding that Bibi and I would jointly discuss all major issues before
jointly agreeing to bring them to the full cabinet.

But in August, the talks ended, after news of our talks finally leaked. I
immediately phoned Ne’eman. I reminded him that at the outset, I’d said that
would mean the discussions were over. He did call me back later in the day to say
Bibi insisted that he’d had nothing to do with the leak. My guess was that the
source was my old comrade from the Chinese Farm, Yitzhik Mordechai, who had
presumably heard that Bibi was ready to make me Defense Minister as part of a
unity government. There was, of course, already a defense minister: Yitzhik.

Bibi’s idea to reopen efforts to get peace with Syria didn’t last either. Although
I’d learn of this only a few years later, he’d approved a visit to Damascus by the
American Jewish businessman Ronald Lauder to meet President Assad. The visit
made it clear to Bibi what successive Israeli leaders had learned: a deal might be
possible, but only if Israel was willing to commit in advance to pulling out of the
Golan. Assad told Lauder to come back to him with a detailed map setting out
Bibi’s view on delineating the Israeli-Syrian border under a peace agreement.
Though no one in the cabinet knew the initiative was underway, Bibi realized that
before sending back the map Assad wanted, he would need to tell the two senior
ministers directly affected: Arik Sharon, who had replaced David Levy as Foreign
Minister; and Yitzhik Mordechai. Both of them said no, with Yitzhik pointing out
that a signed map would inevitably become part of the negotiating record. It was a
step that, in future negotiations, could not be undone.

Bibi’s coalition was now creaking. The Syrian option was off. David Levy had
already jumped ship. Yitzhik, increasingly concerned about Bibi’s delay and drift
on Oslo II, seemed to be thinking of leaving as well. Right wing ministers and
Knesset members were no happier: they opposed even the slightest prospect of
movement on Oslo. In October, Bibi did finally try to seize the initiative. He
wrapping up the redeployment details in a summit with Arafat and Clinton and
Arafat in Wye River. But as soon as he got back home, he started backtracking,
rather than risk facing down his right-wing critics in the cabinet. Implementation of

Martin County School District won't settle for B

July 27, 2007

STUART—The Martin County School District was just short
of earning a perfect report card from the state in late June.

But the district, which earned 18 A’s and one B, has a chance
to earn straight A’s. School officials are appealing J.D. Parker
School of Science, Math & Technology’s B grade. The Stuart
elementary school had enough points to be considered an “A”
school, but because the lowest 25 percent of the school’s students
didn’t make learning gains, the state dropped the grade to a B.

Martin had the second-highest percentage of A schools
among the state’s 67 counties. Gilchrist County had the highest
percentage of A’s, though the county in northeastern Florida only
has four schools.

The district is also filing an appeal for Warfield Elementary
in Indiantown. The school received an A, but did not make
adequate yearly progress under the federal No Child Left Behind
Act, state data shows.

The result of all this is that teachers are now being “held accountable”
for their teaching, which is another way of saying, Get those test scores
up or else.

The following is from an article on the front page of the New York
Times (December 23, 2007):

Mr. Obama, for instance, in a speech last month in New
Hampshire denounced the law (NCLB) as “demoralizing our
teachers.” But he also said it was right to hold all children to
high standards. “The goals of this law were the right ones,” he
said.

When Mtr. Edwards released an education plan earlier this
year, he said the No Child law needed a “total overhaul.” But he
said he would continue the law’s emphasis on accountability.

And at the elementary school in Waterloo, Mrs. Clinton said
she would “do everything I can as senator, but if we don’t get it
done, then as president, to end the unfunded mandate known as
No Child Left Behind.”

growth, and 5) mobile monetization headwinds.

Upside risks to our price objective are: 1} improved mobile monetization 2} major OTA
sign on for instant booking 3) high non-hotel shopper dollar capture and 4) improved
global macro environment.

Trivago NV (TRVG)

Our PO of $15 is based on a 3.5x 2018E EV/Sales multiple. We note that 3.5x is roughly
in line with the lead generation peer group average 2018E EV/Sales multiple. We think
our EV/Sales multiple is warranted as a balance between Trivago's higher growth and
lower profitability. Our price objective is supported by our DCF analysis.

Downside risks to our price objective are: 1) Growing competition, 2) Elevated marketing
spend, 3) High Customer concentration, 4) Macro and FX risks, and 5) Potential for loss
of hotel inventory.

Twitter (TWTR)

Our $14.5 price objective is based on 12x our 2018 EBITDA estimate, which reflects a
discount to the online media group (13x). We believe the Twitter platform has slowing
user and revenue growth and as such, we expect the stock to trade at a sustained
discount to online media peers, with potential M&A adding some offsetting downside
support.

Downside risks to our PO are: 1) decelerating user growth that may raise concerns on
long-term revenue opportunity, 2) pressure on usage due to emergence of competing
services, 3) new ad initiatives may not perform well, resulting in lower advertiser
demand for Twitter ads, 4) monetization of logged-out users and third party application
users are slow to materialize, and 5} on a EV/EBITDA basis Twitter is more attractive
today than in the past, but stock remains subject to multiple compression.

Upside risks to our PO are: 1) User adds could ramp on new product initiatives in the 2H,
and accelerating user growth may increase optimism on long-term revenue opportunity,
2) with new demographic targeting initiatives, Twitter is able to capture more TV dollars
(vs online ad dollars) that are incremental with video ads, 3) the NFL broadcasts and
other video content (live political, entertainment, etc.) could help Twitter grow users
meaningfully in the long term, 4) guidance could prove to be conservative, 5) traction
from monetization of logged-out users and 6) potential that Twitter could be acquired.

Wayfair (W)

Our price objective of $44 is based on 0.7x 2018E EV/sales. We continue to focus on
EV/Sales given Wayfair's lack of profitability to date. Our 0.7x target multiple is a
discount to W's eCommerce comp group and at a modest discount to W's retail comp
group. We think the multiple is appropriate given stronger revenue growth vs. peers,
balanced by lower profitability and competitive risks.

Downside risks are: 1) GAAP operating losses expected through 2018, making valuation
analysis more complex, 2) competition from several well capitalized companies including
Amazon, 3) brand complexity (5 brands), 4) category limitations, 5) partner segment
revenue headwinds, and 6) execution risk on International expansion.

Yahoo! (YHOO)

Our price objective of $57 is based on our sum-of-parts valuation assumptions. Our $53
estimated asset value represents $39/share from the remaining Alibaba stake (using
$122 Alibaba valuation {10% discount rate, mid-term FCF FY18-25E CAGR of 18%, 4%
terminal growth} x 384mn shares at 20% discount rate), $6.1 for Yahoo Japan, $0.5 for

When I complained to my son, who had co-produced the film, that I don’t throw phones when I
lose cases—even capital cases—my son responded: “Dad, you’ve got to get it through your head
that the person on the screen isn’t you; it’s your character—‘the Dersh Character.’” He
continued to assure me, in his best professional manner, that characters have to “establish
themselves” early in the film, and that this “establishing scene” was intended to convey my energy
and my passion for the rights of criminal defendants. “If we had several hours, we could have
demonstrated your passion by recounting your involvement in many other cases, but we had about
a minute; hence the smashed phone.”

I wasn’t satisfied. “That scene doesn’t show passion,” I said. “It shows a temper tantrum.” My
son tried to explain that a character in a film has to be shown with some faults early on in the film,
so that he can “overcome” them. “I know you don’t lose your temper,” Elon assured me
smilingly, “but the viewing audience has to see you grow.”

Still, I didn’t like being portrayed as a person whose passions—manifested by occasional curses in
addition to the smashed phone—are reserved exclusively for his professional life. My “girlfriend”
in the film—a mostly fictional character played by Annabella Sciorra—complains loudly that my
character has nothing left for the people around him, and my character seems to agree: “My
clients are the people I care about.” Poor guy! I hope that’s not me, although I do have to
acknowledge that people who know me only professionally assume that I have nothing left for
those I love. But the fact is that I reserve a lot of love, loyalty and friendship for family and
people close to me.

I asked Ron Silver—who knows how important my family and friends are to me—how he felt
playing me in way that he knew was something of a stereotype of the passionate lawyer for
whom, Oliver Wendell Holmes’ said, “the law is a jealous mistress.” He responded: “I’m playing
the public Alan Dershowitz—the one people see on TV and in the newspapers. I can’t get to
know the private Alan well enough to play him, and frankly the public isn’t interested in that side
of you.”

In this book, I will try to interest my readers in both sides of my life, and how each impacts the
other, and how both are very much the products of my early upbringing and my lifelong
experiences. I think of myself as an integrated whole, though the very different roles I play—as
lawyer, teacher, writer, father, husband, friend, colleague—require somewhat different balances
among the various elements of my persona.

Although this autobiography is my first attempt to explore my life in full, I have written several
earlier books that touch on aspects of my public life. The Best Defense dealt with my earliest
cases during the first decade of my professional life. Chutzpah covered my Jewish causes and
cases. Reversal of Fortune and Reasonable Doubts each dealt with one specific case (Von Bulow
and O.J. Simpson). I will try not to repeat what I wrote in those books, though some overlap is
inevitable. This more ambitious effort seeks to place my entire professional life into the broader
context of how the law has changed over the past half century and how my private life prepared
me to play a role in these changes.

Trump's Saudi Arms Sale Is About Politics and 
Economics, Not Security 
by Mitchell Bard 
President Trump wants to use his emergency 
powers to sell billions of dollars' worth of 
weapons to Saudi Arabia on national security 
grounds. Congress wants to stop the sale 
because of lingering anger over Saudi abuses 
and the murder of journalist Jamal 
Khashoggi, and the usurpation of its legal 
authority to review arms sales. Both sides are 
ingenuous. The willingness to sell the Saudis - 
weapons has little to do with American national security, and 
everything to do with economics and politics.

Today's interdependent global economy requires that trade policy be

In view of such past successes of the Russian intelligence services, it cannot be precluded that
there was another person in the NSA working with Snowden who used an enthusiastic as cover to
prevent any light from falling on his own surreptitious spying. While it may seem extremely
unlikely that Snowden had such assistance, the alternative scenario, that Snowden broke into the
sealed compartments and made off with the documents without any assistance, seems equally
unlikely.

Even if Snowden had been, as he claims, a pure idealist seeking to right a perceived wrong, it

does exclude the possibility of his becoming entangled in the plots of others. Intelligence services
make it their business to bring about such witting or unwitting entanglements.

capital intensity, which might not matter much, but also a faster transfer of new
technology into actual production, which would. Steady-state growth would not be

affected, but intermediate-run transitions would, and those should be observable.

That idea seemed to correspond to common sense, and it still does. By 1958 I was
able to produce a model that allowed for the embodiment effect. ... If common sense
was right, the embodiment model should have fit the facts better than the earlier
one. But it did not. Dension (1985) , whose judgment I respect, came to the
conclusion that there was no explanatory value in the embodiment idea. I do not

know if that find should be described as a paradox, but it was at least a puzzle.

Edward Denison was another leading growth economist Solow consulted.
Remember that Solow had defined disembodied growth to mean better use of
existing assets, as when ships carrying coal to Newcastle are inspired to reverse the
business plan. It is easy to see how disembodied growth could come more or less for
free. But Solow puzzled how embodied growth, which needs “new and different

capital equipment,” could arrive without “ a policy to increase investment.”

It can for the same reason that Achilles can overtake the tortoise. Solow’s problem, |
think, may have been that new and different capital equipment stands to embodied
novelty as a new and different chicken laying a new and different egg. We can see
how the different capital might come first through saving from consumption
deferment. And it seems clear that the embodied novelty could not. But one of the
beauties of calculus is that it allows chicken and egg to evolve simultaneously.

Neither novelty precedes the other at the instant of first embodiment.
This time it is Newton and Leibnitz to the rescue, along with the trusty Gunnar
Myrdal, if 1 guess right about Solow’s misgivings. Since he understands calculus and

Myrdal far better than I do, I may guess wrong. So let me try another way. It seems

to me that embodied growth is still disembodied growth at a finer and more basic

for Zain and Mobily to be allowed to increase market share in the mobile arena. We thus
believe the regulator (CITC) regulator will have to consider further steps to afford
market share to the second and third entrants including asymmetric competition
measures (pricing, MTRs), license extensions or differentiated royalty rates.

STC the likely beneficiary of FTTH expansion

Whilst we argue that STC could lose further market share in the Mobile market as a
result of regulatory moves, we believe the negative impact will be offset by growing
revenues from FTTH, IPTV and the corporate market. Indeed, we believe STC, given its
market leading FTTH network and IPTV offering, will likely benefit most acutely from
the growth in the number of FTTH customers. Furthermore, with government grants
likely to be provided for FTTH roll out in less economical areas (as part of the NTP), we
believe returns will likely not suffer from the additional capital deployment. Mobily could
also benefit (given its well-developed FTTH infrastructure), although we expect it to lag
STC who has a first mover advantage and arguably a stronger FTTH/Triple play offering.

We note, Zain KSA will unlikely participate in the rollout of the FTTH expansion given its
constrained balance sheet and strategic focus on the wireless market. That said, the
company could benefit from the rollout of high speed internet solutions over its wireless
network (ie fixed broadband over its 4G network), particularly in areas where the
construction of FTTH networks maybe be difficult or uneconomical.

Royalty rate increases unlikely, particularly for Zain KSA and Mobily

Admittedly, an increase in royalties could be an easy way of raising much needed
revenues for the government. After all, each 1% increase could raise income by more
approximately SAR500mn (cUS$130mn). However, we would argue that this is unlikely
given the lack of sufficient competition in the market and the obstacles to increased
competition higher royalty rates would introduce. In the same vein, we also believe it
highly unlikely that the government would seek to introduce a fourth mobile operator
license given the lack of sufficient market capacity between the second and third
operators.

Religious tourism a material opportunity for telecom providers

Saudi Arabia’s ambitious growth targets for religious tourism provide a material
opportunity for the telecom providers in our view. More specifically, if the number of
religious tourists (for Hajj and Umrah) increases by an estimated 10mn per annum by
2020, we believe demand for roaming services (voice and data) and sim purchases will
increase significantly. Indeed, on our estimates, we see the 10mn visitors potentially
providing a SAR2bn-SAR4bn opportunity, representing a c4-8% uplift in total wireless
revenues for service providers. We particularly believe Zain KSA will benefit strongly
from this given they provide the most competitive Pay as you go packages currently and
have the largest spare capacity on their network.

expectations than other relationships. Polyamorists sometimes disagree about whether
relationship hierarchies are desirable.

soft limit (BDSM): A weak, negative BDSM preference that is discussed ahead of time.
For example, a person may strongly dislike anal sex, but be willing to have anal sex in
certain contexts, like when he’s really turned on; in that case, anal sex would be a soft
limit. See also: hard limit.

squick (BDSM): A feeling of not wanting to participate in an act, without judging others
for doing it. For example, if a BDSMer feels sick at the sight of blood yet doesn't want to
express disgust towards blood fetishists, then she might describe herself as squicked by
blood. The BDSM subculture generally places a high value on recognizing that one can
be squicked by an act, without judging it.

submissive (BDSM): A person who enjoys receiving orders or otherwise accepting an
experience defined by a partner.

swing: A community to support people who want to have sex with multiple people and
be honest with everyone involved. Unlike polvamorists, swingers usually don't
emphasize developing emotional connections in secondary relationships, but this isn't
always true. Clarisse is less familiar with swing than polyamory, but some swingers
emailed her this Swing 101: http:/Awww.swingersboard.com/forums/fag.php?

sadistic is dominant, and vice versa.

vanilla (BDSM): A term to describe people who aren't into BDSM, or sexual acts that
aren't perceived as BDSM. Some folks describe so-called slightly BDSM people or acts
as french vanilla. Sometimes, non-BDSM people are offended by being described as
vanilla, which Clarisse thinks is silly, but she often avoids the term anyway and says not
into S&M instead.

by Vicky Ward <http://www.vanityfaincom/contributors/vicky-ward> 
March 8, 2011, 2:30 PM 
I've got a story idea for you. The rebuilding of Indonesia. Or New Orleans. Or both. Go there. I've just been. 
You will never think the same way about anything again. 
So spoke not Bill or Melinda Gates, but Ghislaine Maxwell, the 48-year-old woman being written up 
everywhere at the moment as the alleged procurer of young women for billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. 
Epstein, 57, is the financier who spent a year in jail on charges of soliciting prostitutes—and now there is talk of 
another investigation because various women, now in their twenties and thirties, have come forward with 
allegations that he molested them when they were under-age. The allegations first surfaced in British 
newspapers, which have zeroed in on Epstein's friendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tried to 
publicly disassociate himself from his old pal. 
I wrote a piece for Vanity Fair in 2003 called The Talented Mr. Epstein. It was largely a business piece that 
focused on his mysterious exit from Bear Stearns in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne, Les 
Wexner, the chairman of Limited Brands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude 
Hoffenberg, who is currently serving a 20-year-jail sentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of 
$450 million. 
The piece alluded to Epstein's great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women 
with whom he had sexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn't really go there, focusing instead on the 
issue that remains a mystery—how Jeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers. 
This is not to say I didn't hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I 
concentrated on the intriguing financial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same 
ones, different ones. And their stories are bone-chilling. Journalists from England have phoned—and, in one 
case, flown—to ask me about Epstein and Maxwell. Who is he? And the British, especially, want to know: Who 
is she? At this point, I am so bored of repeating myself to others—it was, after all, my 2003 Vanity Fairstory 
that really brought him into the limelight—that I have decided to write about this myself. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030467 
Bizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to know Jeffrey and Ghislaine far better after my piece than before it. I kept 
running into both of them, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of 
young women with him who stand two feet behind him, as if serving a monarch. Do they speak? I remember 
asking him once, nodding at his lookalike blondes. He laughed. Not like you,Vicky, was his riposte. 
I remembered that when we'd once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I hadn't 
studied math since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a package at 
home via messenger. It was a book: Math for idiots. 
So he is not without humor, even though he doesn't drink or smoke, and hates restaurants. 
Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects, newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He 
was certainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few 
moments in his company and you know this to be true. 
When I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that 
Andy—as Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his 
strange title is. Because if one thing's for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what 
he's talking about far more than Andy does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other 
financiers hang out with him. 
And Ghislaine? 
Full disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It's almost impossible not to. 
She is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I've spent hours 
talking to her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is 
curious. She has spent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent 
me a DVD of the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away almost anyone else's I can think of—probably even 
Rupert Murdochs'. She is very well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill 
Clinton with whom she is close friends. 
Yet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-
Platero, (known fondly to her close friends as the Tennis Goddess) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When 
it comes down to things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her vulnerability. 
And that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey. 
He saved her, I remember a close friend of mine telling me. When her father died, she was a wreck; 
inconsolable. And then Jeffrey took her in. She's never forgotten that—and never will. 
In many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect 
replacement for her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his 
sexual pecadillos, but then Ghislaine's father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving 
a massive black hole he'd fraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey's habits may not have seemed that 
strange. 
In fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful 
people in the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl 
issues, and moved countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You 
don't tend to get to the top by being the world's most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett 
didn't quite manage a normal life—whatever that is. He had a second wife for many years whose existence he 
has been open about. 
So what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven't spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her 
loyalty to friends like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about as always. Look 
at Waksal and Stewart. No one sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up for

Fig. 4.10: The three main components of the DUAL model: the retinotopic visual array (RVA),
the visual working memory (VWM) and DUAL’s semantic memory. Attention is allocated to
an area of the visual array by the object in VWM controlling attention, while scene and object
categories corresponding to the contents of VWM are retrieved from the semantic memory.

In principle the DUAL framework seems quite powerful; using the language of CogPrime,
however, it seems to us that the learning mechanisms of DUAL have not been formulated in
such a way as to give rise to powerful, scalable cognitive synergy. It would likely be possible
to create very powerful AGI systems within DUAL, and perhaps some very CogPrime -like
systems as well. But the systems that have been created or designed for use within DUAL so
far seem not to be that powerful in their potential or scope.

In a rather different direction, James Albus, while at the National Bureau of Standards, de-
veloped a very thorough and impressive architecture for intelligent robotics called 4D/RCS,
which was implemented in a number of machines including unmanned automated vehicles. This
architecture lacks critical aspects of intelligence such as learning and creativity, but combines
perception, action, planning and world-modeling in a highly effective and tightly-integrated
fashion.

The architecture has three hierarchies of memory/processing units: one for perception, one
for action and one for modeling and guidance. Each unit has a certain spatiotemporal scope,

Exchange Commission. EB-5 is a federal program that allows foreign investors the chance to gain a green

card if they invest at least $500,000 into certain projects that create at least 10 jobs.

The SEC’s complaint said, however, that much of this money was misallocated to pay for Matthews’
personal expenses. Some of the funds allegedly went to pay for Mathews’ Connecticut home, his 151-

foot mega yacht, as well as to save his Palm Beach mansion from foreclosure, according to the complaint.

In a separate lawsuit filed by a group of EB-5 investors, the development group claimed that famous
celebrities and politicians such as Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Celine Dion and Bill Koch — would serve

on the Palm House’s advisory board when, in fact, they did not.

Related Companies, led by Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross, developed CityPlace West Palm Beach.
The company is also proposing to build a 25-story office project called One Flagler in downtown West

They are amazing, but no one knows how long they can be sustained. Even Summers and DeLong concede that “even if it
is granted that the stimulus can be both timely and temporary, the question of how large it can be while preserving these
attributes remains for future research”. If one of these trends could not be sustained, my guess is that it would be fiscal
constraints rather than monetary ones. While it’s great to see rising Federal debt not adversely affecting Treasury
markets, the chart on the left reminds me of The Day of the Triffids.

What is The Day of the Triffids?

It’s a 1951 science fiction novel. There’s a meteor shower, and most people go outside to look at it. The next morning,
everyone who looked at the meteor shower ends up blind, and Earth is taken over by giant man-eating venomous

plants. The point: some amazing events which look benign have unforeseen consequences. Will a pact of going for
growth pay the freight of higher Federal debt in the long run? Hard to say; there are not a lot of examples to draw

from. Economic theories and their associated debt bubbles don’t always work out as planned [a]. After WWII, the US
also faced a debt ratio of 80% of GDP. Austerity was not the answer back then; government receipts and outlays as a %
of GDP did not change much during the 1950’s, and net debt was flat. So how did US debt/GDP fall from 80% to 46%
in just ten years? Robust annualized real growth of more than 4.0%, and 2.0% inflation. However, unique economic
conditions and productivity gains of the 1950’s (e.g., interstate highway, rebuilding of Europe and Japan) may not be
repeated, and the country was not headed into an entitlement time bomb. If the US does not experience a
growth/productivity boom, the burden of higher debt could last for a generation or more. A pro-growth Administration
would probably help, but the difficulty lay in defining exactly what that means.

Isn't it amazing? 1950's debt reduction was based on growth, not austerity

he invited me to meet him at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem. During the course of
the conversation, he surprisingly asked what I would do with the peace process if I were
him. I had just re-read his autobiography, Warrior, and answered: “Both as a soldier
and as a politician, you have a history of being bold, daunting, daring and making
surprise moves. In that spirit, 1 would suggest that you dismantle the settlements and
pull your troops completely out of Gaza.” For a minute I worried that this would anger
him, but he answered very calmly. “I cannot do it.” I asked why. He said: “Because of
the harbor.” I replied, rather perplexed: “But there is no harbor in Gaza.” He said:
“That’s not the point. They could build one if we left Gaza.” Then I realized that,
contrary to common opinion, Sharon had no ideological inhibitions about leaving
Gaza. His concerns were only about security. This gave me high hopes that he would
eventually do it. Three years of stalemate were to follow. And then in December 2003,
out of the blue, Sharon made the sweeping and stunning pronouncement that Israel
would leave Gaza and end its occupation of the Strip.

Ariel Sharon deserves praise for withdrawing from Gaza. But his unilateral move
undermined the possibility of peaceful relations between the inhabitants of the Gaza
Strip and Israel. The PLO and the Palestinian Authority were sidelined. They could not
claim credit for the move, and thus had scant motivation for supporting it. Instead,
militants in Gaza and the West Bank harvested all the benefits. The Disengagement
plan undermined those on the Palestinian side who claimed that the negotiating table
was a more efficient tool than the barrel of a gun in order to resolve the conflict.

ON PART II: PEACE PROPOSALS AND IDEAS

The formal agreements covered in Part I represent the conclusions of long and complex
diplomatic processes. Part II encompasses proposals and ideas that contributed to
breaking taboos and changing opinions that paved the way for precedent-setting
agreements.

In the late 1970s and 1980s several plans and initiatives were put forward which
maintain relevance for the future of the peace process. One idea was a comprehensive
and unified Arab approach which was first proposed in the Fahd Plan (1981), and later
refined in the Arab Peace Initiative of 2002. The latter peace proposal promoted by
then Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah al-Saud represented a unified shift in the Arab
States’ approach to Israel. Where there was once rejection, the Arab peace initiative
created the possibility of universal recognition of the State of Israel. All 57 countries of
the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) endorsed the initiative.

The aftermath of the Gulf War of 1991 opened new opportunities to address the
complex issue of peace in the Middle East. This was the backdrop for the groundbreak-
ing Madrid Peace Conference, convened by the United States and the Soviet Union. It
raised new hopes for peaceful resolution to the enduring conflicts of the region. The
conference created an unprecedented platform for peace talks, based on the principle of
“land for peace”. The Israelis would have to cede land to their Arab adversaries in
return for peace and security. The Madrid formula for organizing such talks followed a

For a post-Voyager probe, ion engines would fire for 15

Star flight enthusiasts are also pondering ion drives
for a truly interstellar mission, aiming for Alpha Cen-

Icarus Interstellar, a nonprofit foundation with a mis-
sion to achieve interstellar travel by the end of the cen-

weighing less than 10 kilograms, equipped with a min-
iaturized high-performance ton drive. The trip would

Such sail craft could
conceivably make the
crossing to Alpha Centauri in a thousand years. Sails
are limited in speed by how close they can get to the
sun, which, in turn, is limited by the sail material’s
durability. Gregory Matloff, a City University of New
York professor and longtime interstellar travel propo-
nent, says the most promising potential material is gra-
phene—ultrathin layers of carbon graphite.

A laser or microwave beam could provide an even
more muscular push. In the mid-1980s, the doyen of
interstellar travel, Robert Forward, suggested piggy-
backing on an idea popular at the time: solar-power
satellites, which would collect solar energy in orbit
and beam it down to Earth by means of microwaves.
Before commencing operation, an orbital power sta-
tion could pivot and beam its power up rather than
down. A 10-gigawatt station could accelerate an ultra-
light sail—a mere 16 grams—to one-fifth the speed of
light within a week. Two decades later, we’d start see-
ing live video from Alpha Centauri.

This “Starwisp” scheme has rts dubious features—it
would require an enormous lens, and the sail is so frag-
ile that the beam would be as likely to fry it as to push
it—but it showed that we could reach the stars within

Europe
UK

The UK legalized prescription based medical cannabis in November 2018. Medical
cannabis treatments that are advertised with specific medical claims must obtain
authorization from the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Currently,
licensed medical cannabis products are Sativex, Dronabinol and Nabilone. Epidiolex,
medical grade pure CBD produced by British pharmaceutical company, GW
Pharmaceuticals, is undergoing the licensing process. “Unlicensed” products may be able
to be obtained, such as products from Tilray or Bedrocan, under special circumstances
which are unmet by other licensed products. Canopy and Aurora announced at the
beginning of 2019 that it plans to export to the UK later this year. Despite changes in
legality, the number of patients who have been prescribed medical cannabis treatments
is quite limited.

While pharmaceutical grade products are difficult to obtain, CBD products are widely
available across the UK. Pure CBD is not a controlled substance under the Misuse of
Drugs Act 1971. Therefore, as long as CBD products are not authorized by the MHRA,
medical claims on labeling and packaging cannot be made. There are also no enforced
regulations for testing or packaging. These loopholes in the legislation have led to an
increasing number of CBD products marketed as health supplements or wellness
products. Due to the growing trend, CBD products have been widely available across the
UK, primarily sold in boutique shops, cafes, health stores and online. Holland and
Barrett, a health foods store, was the first High Street store to carry CBD products in
2017. Other mainstream outlets now sell hemp-based beauty products, CBD tinctures,
edibles, vapes, e-liquids and other forms of the substance. A handful of restaurants also
offer CBD cocktails or hot drinks, and the number of kitchens and chefs using cannabis-
based products is increasing across the country.

However, in January 2019, the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) announced that it
plans to conduct an investigation of CBD products for consumer safety. It is expected
that the FSA will later provide requirements for authorization. This may take up to 18
months. Although enforcement is unclear at the moment, some CBD products have
already been removed from the shelves. Since the FSA’s assessment does not apply to
cosmetics or skincare products with CBD, some CBD companies have expressed interest
in launching beauty products now.

A license is required in order to cultivate hemp in the UK. There are restrictions on
where the farm can be located that must be approved by the Home Office. Many
companies still struggle to secure banking and payment options for their hemp-related
businesses. A lobbying group, the British Hemp Association, was formed to educate and
push for legislative changes, such as whole plant processing and financial support. Due
to barriers of entry, the number of hemp farmlands is small, around 810 hectares.

Italy

Medical cannabis has been legal in Italy since 2013, yet access and supply remained
restricted for years. In 2017, the Military Chemical and Pharmaceutical Plant (MCPP)
received a license to cultivate medical cannabis, which supplemented the imported
supply from the Netherlands (i.e. from Bedrocan). The MCPP cultivates a medical
cannabis product, FM2, that contains 5-8% THC and 7.5-12% CBD. A high THC product
(FM1) and a CBD product (FMO) will soon be available. The MCPP only produces 100-150

         REMEMBERING CAVALIER MAGAZINE

LAUNCHING A MAGAZINE


     My friend Michael Simmons, who has been the editor of National Lampoon, recalls that Cavalier hired fine scribes. A few examples: Thomas Pynchon, Philip Roth, William Saroyan, Isaac Asimov, Theodore Sturgeon. Characters show up from Andy Warhol to Timothy Leary. And the photos of models weren’t even soft porn, merely tits and ass.


     Cavalier was launched by Fawcett Publications in 1952. Men’s magazine Cavalier (motto: “For the American Male”) was published the year before Playboy, to whom it has often been compared. Back in the day, Cavalier tried to be seen as slightly hipper, more youthful, and considered a bit more clever than its big name rival. Almost an anti-establishment in Playboy. A slogan stated: “Your dad bought Playboy; you bought Cavalier.”


I BECAME A COLUMNIST


     I was invited to write a column, named “The Naked Emperor,” for Cavalier, that was beginning to publish underground writers and artists. They paid me $1,000 a month. My first column, in 1964, was a report on an auction of two-inch squares from the hotel bedsheets slept on by the Beatles during their first trip to America.


     There were 300 screaming young girls, off on a fetishist’s holiday. Obviously, there wouldn’t be enough items to go around, but it was announced that the Beatles’ unwashed towels and bed linens were to be cut into two-inch squares and sold for $1 each. The price included a notarized statement of authenticity.


     My second column was about Lenny Bruce—titled “Lenny the Lawyer,” since he defended himself in trials He was arrested for obscene performances only because there were no blasphemy laws, and he ridiculed religious leaders. I went to the bank and deposited my check, withdrawing half of it in cash, a $500 bill. Lenny was alone in his funky hotel room on Christmas Day when I presented it to him. And, with a large safety pin, Lenny attached the $500 bill to the outside breast pocket of his dungaree jacket.


AFTER JFK ASSASSINATION


       In another column of mine, “Jack Ruby and His Dirty Little Secret,” it began, “Lenny Bruce once told me how all the night club comics used to gossip about Jack Ruby’s “tattoo of a lady’s schmutzik (translate: pussy) in his armpit.” If it weren’t a fact, I was quite willing to settle for an apocryphal allusion which nevertheless crystallized the entire personality of that alleged murderer who wanted so very much to be liked.


      I say alleged because upon Ruby’s own death. Dallas District Attorney Henry Wade said he would dismiss the murder charge against him, a promise which has since been kept, although no such posthumous grace was ever officially bestowed on Lee Harvey Oswald, considered a lone assassin who shot President Kennedy. See, they grant you retroactive innocence only in the face of innumerable witnesses who were present at the actual event through the legal miracle of inadvertent televised coverage.


     Now Jack Ruby’s dirty little secret has been forever sealed away in his armpit by the hymen of history. Oh yeah, and at Lenny’s funeral, that safety pin was still attached on his denim jacket.


JULES SIEGEL                      


       Two years before Lenny’s death, with his permission I published his obituary in my own magazine, The Realist. Before the issue went to press, he called his mother and a few others to let them know it would only be a hoax. The point was that he couldn't get work and his work was his life so he might as well be dead. And if people regretted that they hadn't helped him, well, now they could have a second chance because he was still alive. The obituary evoked inquiries from newspapers, wire services, foreign publications, radio and TV.


       “What's the meaning of it?” one editor asked me. “There's a lot of excitement at the city desk.”


       “That is the meaning of it.”


     A few years later, without my permission, Jules Siegel, the editor of a short-lived magazine, Cheetah, published a fake obituary of me. I thought it was funny. An Associated Press reporter called, and I explained that it was a hoax.


     “Are you sure?” he asked.


     “Of course. I would tell you if I was dead.”


     Siegel started writing for Cavalier. His first assignment was a profile of Sterling Hayden, an actor best known in Dr, Stranglove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.


     Journalist Adam Ellsworth described Siegel’s “Goodbye Surfing, Hello God” with his most famous example of rock journalism, though his most revolutionary was his article, “The Big Beat.” It appeared in the Playboy-esque Cavalier magazine in 1965 and was one of the earliest writings he’d ever seen on the development of rock and roll, from slaves singing in chains on their way to America to Bob Dylan “going electric” at the Newport Folk Festival. 


     Then Jules’ friend, Arthur Kretchmer, became Cavalier’s managing editor. “When the editorial director later resigned,” Kretchmer said, “there was a 24-hour hiatus before the new editorial director arrived.” Siegel and Kretchmer had been discussing the possibility of publishing an issue on rock and roll, so to make it happen, Kretchmer went into the office at night and retyped the magazine’s schedule to include their ideas.


     When the new editorial director started, Kretchmer handed him the schedules and said, “Here’s what we’re working on.” The new editorial director suspected nothing and the rock and roll issue went ahead. Once the laughter died down, Jules talked for a good 25 minutes about some of the ups and downs of his writing career and how hard it is to make a living as any kind of a writer, let alone a “rock journalist.” and the people who created it, seriously.


     Now everybody writes about rock and roll that way. Jules was one of the people who did it first. He died of a heart attack on November 17, 2012 at the age of 77. He was a brilliant author, but neither Rolling Stone nor the New York Times honored him with an obituary. Not even a fake one.


COMIX


     Art Spiegelman tells me his work at Cavalier 50 years ago:


      I was first invited into the mag to do two full-color comix pages in 1969 (when being printed in color was a Very Big Deal for me as was Getting Paid more than 25 bucks for a drawing), somehow in proximity to a big article on underground comix. It was around the time Vaughn Bode was made a regular contributor to the magazine, They were running some Crumb “Fritz the Cat” pages. All thanks to their hip, laid back and kind editor, Alan LeMond.


     I also did some gag cartoons, short strips and occasional illustrations for Cavalier (one especially bad drawing for a story by Bruce Jay Friedman, I recall). My work as an apprentice underground cartoonist taking too many drugs was really, really awful. By the time I'd gotten incrementally better as a cartoonist in the first half of the 1970s I was regularly doing illustrations for soft-core fiction stories in Cavalier's low-rent sister mags, Dude, Gent and Nugget (even wrote a story or two there and got several of my San Francisco comix cronies -- Spain Rodriguez, Bill Griffith and Justin Greene) illustration gigs for those mags as well.


         [Note in Wikipedia: Maus is a graphic novel by American cartoonist Art Spiegelman, serialized from 1980 to 1991. It depicts Spiegelman interviewing his father about his experiences as a Polish Jew and Holocaust survivor. The work employs postmodernist techniques and represents Jews as mice, Germans as cats, and Poles as pigs. In 1992, Maus won a Pulitzer Prize.]


COMiING AND GOING          


     I wrote some movie reviews for Cavalier. I recall that Midnight Cowboy was 50 years ago. I always went to two screenings. The first one I would go stoned with magic mushrooms. The second one I took notes. However, I got fired by Cavalier.


     They declined to publish a particular column–-my review of MASH as though it were a Busby Berkeley musical called Gook Killers of 1970-– ostensibly on the grounds of bad taste, but I learned that three wholesalers had told the publisher they were pressured by the FBI and would refuse to distribute Cavalier if my name appeared in it.


     On top of that, my name was on a list of sixty-five “radical” campus speakers, released by the House Internal Security Committee. The blacklist was published in the New York Times, and picked up by newspapers across the country. It might have been a coincidence, but my campus-speaking engagement-bookings stopped abruptly. It felt just like a film.


OH, WELL


       It was over for me, but it had been fun—like the issue with only the one large red headline on the Cavalier cover: “BEAT ‘EM SENSELESS FIRST”—THE FREE SPEECH CONTROVERSY, BY PAUL KRASSNER...


     At the University of California in Berkeley on September 1964, Dean Katherine Towle banned posters, easels and tables at the Bancroft-Telegraph Street entrance to the Berkeley campus “because of interference with flow of traffic.” She also reminded student groups of “rules prohibiting the collection of funds and the University facilities for the planning and implementing of off-campus political and social action.”


     As a result, students held a sit-in lasted till 3 a.m. Next day, ten tables were manned again, and a campus policeman approached one of the tables (manned by the Congress of Racial Equality) where a dozen persons were seated. One was singled out and placed under arrest. But before you could say nonviolent demonstration, the police car was surrounded, its captors reaching as many as 3,000 students. During the late evening, bored fraternity men gathered and tossed lighted cigarettes and eggs on those sitting in the plaza. The demonstrators responded with silence.


       Next day, 450 police assembled on campus to remove the cop car and its arrested inhabitant, but an agreement to negotiate was reached and the demonstrators dispersed. One of the folk songs to come out of the Free Speech Movement was If I Negotiate With You to the tune of the Beatles’ If I Fell in Love With You.


       Over the next couple of months there was a series of sit-ins and attempted negotiations, and then, on December 2, the infamous Sproul Hall sit-in. It took twelve hours for 800 students to be arrested by some 600 instructors of a new course called Introductory Police Brutality. These were from the lab notes student took:


 “We should do like they do in them foreign countries—beat ‘em senseless first, then throw them in the bus.”


       There was a freshman co-ed at Berkeley who—long after she had forgotten what some professor spouted during an official lecture about Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment—would remember, with perhaps a twinge of frightened pride, learning from a fellow demonstrator that if she planned to go limp when the police arrested her, it would be an act of practical feminine foresight to remove the earrings from her pierced lobes in advance.


     So, now in 2019, fighting over free speech has been happening heavily at Berkeley campus again. Meanwhile, Trump grabbed the pussy of the Statue of Liberty. Cavalier, anyone?

Potential Risk at Expiry & Options Limited Duration Risk

Unlike owning or shorting a stock, employing any listed options strategy is by definition
governed by a finite duration. The most severe risks associated with general options
trading are total loss of capital invested and delivery/assignment risk, all of which can
occur in a short period.

Investor suitability

The use of standardized options and other related derivatives instruments are
considered unsuitable for many investors. Investors considering such strategies are
encouraged to become familiar with the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized
Options (an OCC authored white paper on options risks). U.S. investors should consult
with a FINRA Registered Options Principal. For detailed information regarding the risks
involved with investing in listed options:

Upside risks to our PO are any asset sales (US, non-integrated assets in Austria or NL)
and revenue upside from T-Home's TV push.

Downside risks to our PO are higher than expected mobile impact coming from new

Epstein is overwhelming and he's even pled guilty to paying for sex with a minor. It's in no way scientific or
rational to assume that because you never saw him with an underage girl he must actually be innocent. It is
possible for a person to be kind and generous with his friends but still a criminal paying for sex with
underage girls in his private life.

Can you confirm if the following quote is accurate?

If anything, the unfortunate period he suffered has caused him to really think about what he wants to do
with his money and his time, and support knowledge,” says Krauss. Jeffrey has surrounded himself with
beautiful women and young women but they're not as young as the ones that were claimed. As a scientist I
always judge things on empirical evidence and he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've
never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were I would
believe him over other people. Though colleagues have criticized him over his relationship with Epstein,
Krauss insists, I don't feel tarnished in any way by my relationship with Jeffrey; I feel raised by it.”

Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire financier who the FBI believes molested around 40 underaged
girls, was assisted by a prominent modeling agent and scout. Here's what we know about Jean
Luc Brunel.

Jeffrey Epstein, you will no doubt recall, is the man who thought ferrying Bill Clinton on his
private jet, lawyering up with superstar Alan Dershowitz, and making frequent $100,000
donations to the Palm Beach Police Department would insulate him from prosecution for his
various depravities.

Say you're not as famous or celebrated as Roman Polanski and you want to sexually

Which included, for the record: buying a 14-year-old Yugloslavian named Natalia Marcinkova
from her parents in order to keep Marcinkova as his sex slave; paying a retinue of women to
trawl Palm Beach for teenagers economically desperate enough to agree to give Epstein
massages that often led to sexual contact; receiving two 12-year-old French girls as a birthday
present; and befriending Michael Wolff.

But as Conchita Sarnoff wrote at The Daily Beast:

Perhaps most disturbing, in terms of possible sex trafficking, was Epstein's relationship with Jean
Luc Brunel, owner of the MC2 modeling agency. According to a complaint filed in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of Florida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, [assistant
and girlfriend Ghislaine] Maxwell, Brunel, [house manager Alfredo] Rodriguez, and Marcinkova
‘deliberately engaged in a pattern of racketeering that involved luring minor children through
MC2, mostly girls under the age of 17, to engage in sexual play for money.

The FBI investigated Epstein, and identified around 40 underaged victims. Sarnoff reports that
the FBI is also investigating MC2 and Brunel for possibly engaging in child sex trafficking.

Hallo everybody!

and from there we go directly to the opening oft he ball where we'll have a really cool Box first row!! 
Dresscode: actually the lifeball is really crazy and 'half naked' We always do a intermediare because 
otherwise you feel like an idiot at the Amfar Gala dinner before. People now don't wear Tuxedos anymore. 
Christoph wear's normal black trouseres with a white shirt and a dar sakko because he doesn't want to be 
in any crazy stuff on all the pics. Half oft he people oft he gala dinenr also waer some 'little' crazy 
stuff like pink velvet sakkos (and a mask for later) or so. girls: Crazy as you like. There are a lot of 
atrists that are really dressed up. I will wear a quiet see-through short dress with high high heels+ a 
chanel Tatoo and will take a face mask fort he ball later. 
So I hope this helped at least a little bit. For pics got to: lifeball.org 
Friday night: We would like to invite you all for dinner and will organize a nice place with a cool bar. 
Aress follows. Pls let me know who wants to join!! 
Sunday: I'm very sure we'll be dead :-) BUT we would like to invite you to our house/garden/pool

control of something like 40 percent of the West Bank. That meant — at least in
theory — that Israel could limit phase-three to a mere token pullout, leaving the
Palestinians with less than half of the territory.

“T don’t know what percentage, exactly,” I replied. “But one of my cabinet
ministers thinks that a formula of 70-10-20 would work, meaning 70 percent for
the Palestinians, ten percent to allow us to retain and secure the largest of the
settlement blocs, and the rest to be worked out in further talks.”” When he nodded, I
added: “Peres thinks it could end up at 80-20, and says he thinks Arafat would find
it hard to walk away from getting control of four-fifths of the West Bank. But it’s
not about the number. It’s about the area needed for the major settlements, and
whatever else is required to safeguard our security. Beyond that, we don’t need a
single inch of the West Bank, and we won’t ask for a single inch.”

I replied in much the same vein when President Clinton urged me to help kick-
start new talks with Assad by formally reaffirming Yitzhak’s “pocket deposit” on
the Golan Heights. As with the Palestinians, I was not going to cede a major
negotiating card — our only real negotiating card — before we had any indication
Assad was serious about making peace. But I did feel it was necessary to reassure
Clinton that / was serious. I told him that, if and when the Syrians showed real
signs of readiness to address our needs in a peace agreement, I would reaffirm the

“pocket deposit.”

I’d come to Washington hoping that President Clinton would be with me on the
main issues of substance. But what I needed most at this point was his support on
the procedural decisions I’d made in order to get to real peace negotiations:
engaging with Syria first, and shifting the emphasis on the Palestinian track away
from the redeployments toward the core permanent-status issues we’d have to
resolve in order to get a peace agreement. What emerged from my first meetings
with President Clinton was essentially a trade-off. He knew I would be ready to
make concessions in pursuit of genuine peace. I was confident that on the route
that I was proposing to take, he would have my back.

But what I couldn’t be sure of was whether my own government would have
my back. On paper, we had a comfortable Knesset majority: 75 out of the 120
seats. But I knew it was inherently vulnerable, both to friction between the
Orthodox parties and assertively secular MKs from Meretz and inside Labor, and
to possible defections over the concessions we might have to consider in peace

Iran would never be foolish enough to
threaten or use nuclear weapons against
the United States, given its robust nuclear
deterrence posture. But the threat or use
of nuclear weapons might not look so
foolish from Iran's perspective. One of
the great strategic lessons drawn from the
long history of conflict in the Middle East
is this: Do not go to war without nuclear
weapons, as Saddam Hussein did when
he invaded Kuwait. The corollary is: Do
not allow the United States to
methodically build-up forces in the Gulf
prior to invading, as Saddam did both in
the run-up to the 1991 re-conquest of
Kuwait and in 2003, before the drive to
topple the regime in Baghdad.

Drawing upon these lessons, Iran will
likely do everything in its power to deny
the United States the ability to surge
conventional forces into the region -- and
that might include threatening to target
U.S. forces with nuclear weapons. Iran
might accept the risk that preemptive use
of nuclear weapons could bring on
American nuclear retaliation, because
failure to do so would mean certain
destruction for the regime. The United
States would be able to build-up
conventional forces in the region and oust
Iran's leaders just as it did in Baghdad.

This line of strategic reasoning runs
counter to conventional wisdom in the

betieve that, more specifically, Epstein's attorneys knew of Epstein's scheme to recruit minors for
Sex and also knew that these minors had civil actions that they could bring against him. In fact,
there was much communication between Epstein's attorneys and the United States Prosecutors in
a jgint attempt to minimize Epstein's civil exposure. For example, on October 3, 2007, Assistant
U.S. Attorney Marie Villafafia sent an email (attached hereto as Exhibit “D’’) to Jay Lefkowitz,
counsel for Epstein, with attached proposed letter to special master regarding handling numerous
expected civil claims against Epstein. The letter reads in pertinent part,

The undersigned, as counsel for the United States of America and
Jeffrey Epstein, jointly write to you to provide information relevant to your
service as a Special Master in the selection of an attorney to represent several
young women who may have civil damages claims against Mr. Epstein. The
U.S. Attorney's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (jointly referred
to as the United States) have conducted an investigation of Jeffrey Epstein
regarding his solicitation of minor females in Palm Beach County to engage in
prostitution. Mr. Epstein, through his assistants, would recruit underage
females to travel to his home in Palm Beach to engage in lewd conduct in
exchange for money. Based upon the investigation, the United States has
identified forty (40) young women who can be characterized as victims
pursuant to 18 USC 2255. Some of those women went to Mr. Epstein's home
only once, some went there as much as 100 times or more. Some of the
women's conduct was limited to performing a topless or nude massage while
Mr. Epstein-masturbated himself. For other women, the conduct escalated to
full sexual intercourse. As part of the resolution of the case, Epstein has
agreed that he would not contest jurisdiction in the Southern District of Florida
for any victim who chose to sue him for damages pursuant to 18 USC 2255.
Mr. Epstein agreed to provide an attorney for victims who elected to proceed
exclusively pursuant to that section, and agreed to waive any challenge to
liability under that section up to an amount agreed to by the parties. The parties
have agreed to submit the selection of an attorney to a Special Master...

Jeffrey Epstein doesn’t want to be branded as a “sex
offender” for life, and no, he’s not a modeling agency secret
sugar daddy (or so its owners say)

Posted by WSF On October - 9 - 2007

Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire money manager who’s agreed to plead guilty to soliciting
underaged hookers and go away for 18 months, doesn’t want to be branded a sex offender for
life. Page Six says his lawyers are thinking about asking prosecutors to drop that requirement
from his plea agreement:

In a letter drafted, but not sent, to U.S.

Attorney Alexander Costa and obtained by Page Six, Epstein’s lawyer, Gerald
Lefcourt, writes, Doing so will have a profound impact [on Epstein] both
immediately and forever after. Not only will he be restricted to a wholly
inappropriate penal facility, but he will be required for the rest of his life

to account for his whereabouts.”

Meanwhile, over the weekend Page Six said that owners of MC2 modeling, run by Jean-Luc
Brunel — who’s also been accused of favoring underaged models in the past — claim that
Epstein is not the secret deep pockets behind the firm, no matter what others say or speculate.

Sweetheart deal!  So goes the critique of the resolution of a long-ago case involving our former client -- and 
now-friend -- Jeffrey Epstein. The critique is profoundly misplaced, supported neither by the law or the facts, 
nor by the structure of our constitutional republic. To the contrary, Jeffrey was subjected to an unprecedented 
federal intrusion into a quintessentially local criminal matter in south Florida. His offense to the social order --
involving sex for hire -- was entirely a matter entrusted to laws of the several States, not the federal 
government. His conduct -- a classic state offense --was being treated exactly that way by able, honest 
prosecutors in Palm Beach County, but the overweening federal government intruded where it did not 
belong. And now, over ten years after the fact, the current assault on federal decision-makers at the time, 
including now-Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta (then the United States Attorney in south Florida), condemns 
the federal authorities for not going far enough. 
The critics are entirely wrong. Neither the facts nor the law support the misguided criticisms being leveled by 
journalists and politicians at federal officials from over a decade ago -- including the highest levels of the 
Justice Department in Washington, D.C.. 
Here are the key facts: Jeffrey Epstein, a successful self-made businessman with no prior criminal history 
whatever, engaged in illegal conduct that amounts to solicitation of prostitution. That was wrong, and it was 
reasonably viewed as a violation of Florida state law. Although no coercion, violence, alcohol, drugs and the 
like were involved, the unsavory facts were carefully assessed by experienced state prosecutors who 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030315 
aggressively enforce state criminal laws. No one turned a blind eye to potential offenses to the public 
order. To the contrary, the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office conducted an extensive 15-month 
investigation, led by the chief of the Sex Crimes Division. Mr. Epstein was then indicted by a state grand jury 
on a single felony count of solicitation of prostitution. 
During that intense investigation, the state prosecutors extensively gathered and analyzed the evidence, met 
face-to-face with many of the asserted victims, considered their credibility -- or lack thereof -- and considered 
the extent of exculpatory evidence. Then, after months of elaborate negotiations, the state prosecutors believed 
they had reached a reasoned resolution of the matter that vindicated the public interest -- a resolution entirely 
consistent with that of cases involving other similarly-situated defendants. 
Then, in came the feds. The United States Attorney's Office tried, to no avail, to fit Mr. Epstein's situation into 
its vision of what it viewed as a commercial trafficking ring targeting minors. This was anything but. At long 
last, the federal authorities acknowledged that stark reality and grudgingly agreed to defer prosecution to the 
state. But there was a huge catch. In the face of our arguments sharply condemning their overreach, the 
federal prosecutors insisted on many unorthodox requirements that tugged at fundamental values of due 
process. For example, the agreement required Mr. Epstein to pay an undisclosed list of asserted victims 
$150,000 each. Even more, the feds insisted that Jeffrey pay for an attorney to represent such unidentified 
victims if any chose to filed civil litigation against him. When asked what possible legal authority supported 
this extravagant exercise of national power, the feds lamely cited a wildly inapposite case from Alaska 
involving cocaine and forced on-the-street prostitution. Apples and oranges. 
Under the federally-forced deal, Jeffrey was sentenced to jail. That would not have been the case under the 
agreed-upon state disposition of this non-violent, consensual commercial arrangement. Jeffrey complied, 
served that sentence, and in the process was treated exactly the same as other state-incarcerated 
individuals. His conduct was exemplary, and so characterized by the state custodial authorities. He continued 
his work, including his many philanthropic efforts. 
Our friend Jeffrey Epstein has paid his debt to society. He has also paid out millions of dollars to the asserted 
victims and their highly-creative lawyers. For over ten years, he has lived an exemplary life, including 
carrying on his wide-ranging philanthropies. Those of us who represented him in the Florida proceedings -- for 
customary professional fees -- now count him as a trusted friend. 
Our nation faces vitally important challenges, many involving the treatment of women and basic human 
dignity. Voices are rightly being raised speaking truth to power, especially about women in the 
workplace. But Jeffrey, an exemplary employer, has long since been called to account by the criminal justice 
system for his misdeeds of yesteryear. In the spirit of the bedrock American belief in second chances, that 
unhappy chapter in Jeffrey's otherwise-magnificent life should be allowed to close once and for all.

Amazon Has A Modest But Expanding Physical Footprint

For CBD companies, expansion through Amazon’s retail locations and more importantly
Whole Foods’ expanding retail footprint are also attractive avenues for reaching new
customers (assuming CBD companies can convince Amazon and Whole Foods to carry
their products). While we currently lack insight into when CBD products may become
available in Whole Foods stores, or what a regional or national rollout might look like,
below we analyze Amazon’s physical footprint to highlight the potential for distribution.

Amazon’s expanding physical footprint is made up of a small number of Go Stores,
Amazon Fresh Grocery Pickup in Seattle, Amazon Branded Book Stores and most
notably its Whole Foods Market business. Whole Foods is a health focused supermarket
chain based out of Austin TX that operates ~470 US locations and was purchased by
Amazon in Aug ’17. Since acquiring Whole Foods, Amazon has deeply integrated it with
the company’s Prime offering. In combination with Amazon’s Prime Now platform,
Whole Foods is now offering 2-hour delivery on thousands of in-store items in 63 cities,
which account for over 50% of the US population and over 2/3rds of US GDP. Whole
Foods also offers curbside pickup in over 20 markets.

he might now not have the credibili y that he had represented, and rumors were
that he had been asked to leave the Department of Justice for inappropriate billing. |
told him in no uncertain terms that if his were true he would need to tell me, as he
was representing my credibility with the government. If he had been asked to leave
the Department of Justice, it would dramatically hurt my chances if it were he
making my case to senior officials. He swore up and down, as southerners are apt to
do, that there was no truth whatsoever to the allegations. Being charged with
untrue allegations rang close to my heart, and | chose to side with Lewis. Only after
my incarceration, when Lewis and Tein came to see me in a 9’x 10’ attorney room
that smelled of urine, and I told them that I was now being sued by many of the girls
on the government list, they expressed their regrets and their willingness to help.
However, as they walked out down the dungeon like hall with the sound of clanging
gates in the background, they were unaware of the security cameras and
microphones throughout the hallway. They chose to high-five one another on
camera and smile with the comment, “This is going to be a couple more years of
fees”. The guards at the jail, accustomed to some of the most heinous physical
crimes imaginable, and hardened against most of humanity’s foibles, were caught off
guard by the exhilaration of the potential of more fees.

Sex for money; it’s a sensitive subject. The reactions range from snl res Dworkin
the feminist who considers all intercourse a form of rape; man inserting his
authority, to Jackie Mason that posits that when a man takes a woman 1 for dinner,
many times his real motivation is the hope of receiving sex at the end of the evening.
He suggests it is hypocritical for the man to be able to pay the florist for flowers, the
doorman for getting a cab, the restaurant for the food, and the liquor store for the
gift of wine, but can’t pay the only person that performs the actual sex act without
committing a crime. Yes, I paid for sex. 1am a john. Yes, ] understand that
prostitution is a crime and a crime that very few johns have even gone to jail for. |
am aware that there are strong feelings amongst many people regarding that crime.
Many countries have legalized it, some states have legalized it; many have a policy of
no enforcement. New York City has escort services that openly advertise, massage
parlors that have neon signs in midtown. In actual fact, the crime of paying for sex at
the time of my transgressions was under penal code 230; equivalent to that of jay
walking unless the girl was under 15. Yes, under the age of 15. That was in New
York. In Florida, the age of consent is 18. Misrepresentation of age is not considered
a defense. Even if the girl worked in a sex establishment where one has to prove age
to work, if the girl was met in a bar where the drinking age is 21, or shows ID that
appears to be valid that she is over 18, that is not a defense. The State Attorneys
who deal with this sort of crime on a regular basis reviewed the case brought by the
local police, and said in no uncertain terms that there “were no real victims “ in the
Epstein case. NO real victims. Their words; they said the women knew what they
were doing. They even brought their best friends to Epstein’s house after going
there a number of times themselves. How could there be a serious crime?

The S&M Feminist

te Kk ok

I wish we could make it so everyone buying a copy of Fifty Shades of Grey would also
buy Clarisse Thorn's The S&M Feminist.”

~ A.V. Flox, editor of BlogHer's Love & Sex section

Clarisse isn't afraid to talk about her own experiences with BDSM, relationships, and
sexual politics. But she's also not afraid to explore some of the issues around consent,
violence, and safety that a lot of the kink cheerleaders would like to sweep under the rug.
She brings a refreshing honesty to her writing that is often lacking. Add to that a deep
commitment to feminism and sex-positivity, and you have an amazing combination.

The tension between kink and feminism is a tough one to hold onto and most people end
up firmly in one camp or the other. What makes Clarisse's writing phenomenal is her
steadfast refusal to avoid doing that. The clarity with which she discusses both sides
without resorting to caricatures or stereotypes is simultaneously inspiring and
challenging. If you're interested in either or both, I can't recommend her enough.”

International Landscape: Global Anti-
Corruption Efforts

In recent years, there has been a growing interna-
tional consensus that corruption must be combated, and the
United States and other countries are parties to a number
of international anti-corruption conventions. Under these
conventions, countries that are parties undertake commit-
ments to adopt a range of preventive and criminal law mea-
sures to combat corruption. The conventions incorporate
review processes that allow the United States to monitor
other countries to ensure that they are meeting their inter-
national obligations. Likewise, these processes in turn permit
other parties to monitor the United States’ anti-corruption
laws and enforcement to ensure that such enforcement and
legal frameworks are consistent with the United States’ treaty
obligations.” US. officials regularly address the subject of

corruption with our foreign counterparts to raise awareness

of the importance of fighting corruption and urge stronger

enforcement of anti-corruption laws and policies.

nomic progress and world trade. As noted, the Anti-Bribery
Convention requires its parties to criminalize the bribery
of foreign public officials in international business transac-
tions.*! As of November 1, 2012, there were 39 parties to
the Anti-Bribery Convention: 34 OECD member coun-
tries (including the United States) and five non-OECD
member countries (Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, the Russian
Federation, and South Africa). All of these parties are
also members of the OECD Working Group on Bribery
(Working Group).”

The Working Group is responsible for monitoring the
implementation of the Anti-Bribery Convention, the 2009
Recommendation of the Council for Further Combating
Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International
Business Transactions, and related instruments. Its mem-
bers meet quarterly to review and monitor implementation
of the Anti-Bribery Convention by member states around
the world. Each party undergoes periodic peer review.”
This peer-review monitoring system is conducted in three
phases. The Phase 1 review includes an in-depth assess-
ment of each country’s domestic laws implementing the
Convention. The Phase 2 review examines the effectiveness
of each country’s laws and anti-bribery efforts. The final
phase is a permanent cycle of peer review (the first cycle of
which is referred to as the Phase 3 review) that evaluates
a country’s enforcement actions and results, as well as the
country’s efforts to address weaknesses identified during the
Phase 2 review. All of the monitoring reports for the par-
ties to the Convention can be found on the OECD website
and can be a useful resource about the foreign bribery laws
of the OECD Working Group member countries.”

The United States was one of the first countries to
undergo all three phases of review. The reports and appen-

dices can be found on DOJ’s and SEC’s websites.** In its

something that was determined was inappropriate. I honestly don't know who was the victim in this case. I
fully expect that these masseuses knew what they were doing, and were not swayed to do anything with
Jeffrey that they were not already doing. That is not to approve of the whole behavior, but lots of peoplel

because in general this is a very sensitive issue and all other things being equal one should take the side of

rational to assume that because you never saw him with an underage girl he must actually be innocent. It is
possible for a person to be kind and generous with his friends but still a criminal paying for sex with
underage girls in his private life.

Source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg. 2016 rate is annualized from the first 3 quarters of data.

Table 5, above, shows a scenario analysis of China’s FX reserves in 2017 under different
trade balance and capital outflows. The analysis makes two assumptions. The first
assumption is all the changes in the Balance of Payment’s (BoP) reserve assets are
reflected in the headline FX reserves figure. The second assumption is that the income
balance is USD -36bn, which was derived from the annual rate since 2015.

We believe a decline of FX reserves to USD 2,600bn to USD 2,900bn would only be a
problem for China if it attempted to implement a “fixed exchange rate” without capital
controls. Such an FX regime requires heavy FX intervention and would put downward
pressure on its FX reserves, making this FX regime choice no longer tenable for China.

The IMF’s framework for calculating adequate FX reserves is based on whether there
are capital controls and whether the currency operates on a fixed or floating exchange
rate regime (Table 6). The latest readings show a fixed exchange rate regime without
capital controls in China would require USD 2,91 1bn of FX reserves, which probably
won't be achieved, as shown in Table 1. Meanwhile, a floating exchange rate regime
with no capital controls would require USD 1,618bn of FX reserves. Fewer FX reserves
would be needed to manage a floating currency that would adjust freely to capital flows.
This reinforces the view that the CNY is moving toward a more flexible FX regime as its
FX reserves are depleted (barring a draconian step capital control measures).

Skeptics may counter that China could always ratchet up capital controls to reassert
control over its currency. However, the efficacy of this is questionable. The experience
of 2016 shows that in spite of more capital controls introduced in late 2015 (e.g.,
onshore window guidance restricting the sale of FX by onshore banks) capital outflows
have continued along with FX reserve depletion, albeit at a slower pace. Ultimately, this
means China’s ability to exert control over the CNY is being eroded, while the risk of
more CNY volatility is rising. This is our scenario for 2017, with the tail risk that “ugly
flows” or illicit capital flight due to domestic financial stability concerns could drive
sharper CNY depreciation and FX reserve depletion. It is under this tail risk scenario that
the temptation for draconian capital controls becomes a danger. For this reason, we
believe it will be important to monitor the nature of the capital outflow and not just the
size of the outflow. Good outflow such as Overseas Direct Investment by state-owned

Topics: US debt ceiling negotiations, a more ambitious European bailout plan (finally), and how large cap growth stocks
and rising corporate profits are patiently waiting for both of them to end

What the EU gave: an easing of lending conditions, and an expanded role for the EU lending facility (EFSF)

* Another 109 bn for Greece, allowing the country to continue to pay off maturing debt (to those not participating in the exchanges)

* Rate on new EU loans to Greece, Portugal and Ireland cut to 3.5%, maturities on new & old loans extended from 7.5 to 15-30 years
* 10 year grace period on interest on new EU loans to Greece; the unpaid interest accumulates

* EU loan facility has the ability to buy sovereign debt in the secondary markets, including a plan to purchase 40 bn of Greek debt
(most likely including much of the Greek debt purchased by the ECB)

* EU loan facility has the ability to lend to countries (even those not in an IMF program) to recapitalize their banks

* Language (with no specifics) regarding the use of EU structural funds to boost growth in Greece

What the EU gets: more austerity, Maastricht with teeth (?) and private sector involvement in Greek debt rollover

* Legally binding national fiscal framework to be developed by end of 2012; fiscal deficits brought to 3% by 2013 at the latest

* Private sector involvement in Greek debt rollover, committed in principle by 30 financial institutions listed in the document released
by the Institute of International Finance; target participation rate of 90%; exchange appears to result in Selective Default credit rating
* Voluntary participation options include exchanging existing debt into 15 or 30 year bond with AAA-guarantees of principal. Bonds
exchanged at par will carry low coupons (4.25% effective), while bonds with higher coupons will be exchanged at a 20% discount

In addition to execution risk in Greece, we are left with
3 other concerns. First, while there’s enough in the EU-
IMF lending facility* to deal with problems in Greece,
Portugal and Ireland, if you include Spain, it gets tight
(note: the chart excludes costs to recapitalize banks). If
Italy or Belgium entered Europe’s Liquidity Hospital, a lot
more money might be needed from European parliaments

Second, as shown below, Europe is now a two-speed economy, with the periphery stuck in neutral (industrial production is one
proxy for this; there are others, such as unemployment, consumption, export shares, etc). Ifthe idea behind the EU/IMF effort
is that austerity will boost growth and lead these countries back to the public markets, there is very little momentum in this
direction. If the status quo in the periphery does not change, all the EU package does is allow the current approach

more time to fail.

The Crooked Course Xxxix

conceded that only the United Nations, and not Israel alone, could delineate on a map
and demarcate on the ground the line of withdrawal. Such a line had to be, to the best of
the United Nations’ knowledge, in conformity with Lebanon’s international boundar-
ies. On this basis, and with the consent of the parties, the UN Secretary-General could
then report to the Security Council and eventually recommend that it should confirm
that Israel had ended its occupation. This understanding led to an agreement for the
United Nations to negotiate with the Governments of Lebanon, Syria and Israel.
Through intense, difficult, and stormy tripartite negotiations over five months, the
UN Secretary-General was in May 2000 able to report to the Security Council that the
UN had reached an agreement with Israel, Syria, and Lebanon on a line of withdrawal
(the so-called Blue Line). On this basis, it was determined that Israeli troops had left all
Lebanese territory. Further, he reported that, consistent with UN requirements, Israel’s
Lebanese proxy, the South Lebanese Army (SLA), had been disarmed and disbanded.
Subsequently, the UN Security Council confirmed the end of Israel’s occupation of
Southern Lebanon in fulfillment of Security Council Resolutions 425 and 426 of 1978.

In September 2004, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1559. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan appointed me as his special envoy for its implementation. In a
nutshell the resolution called for respect for Lebanon’s sovereignty, territorial integrity,
and political independence; the disbanding and disarming of all Lebanese and non-
Lebanese militias; and the withdrawal of all foreign troops. After Israel’s full withdrawal
from Lebanon in 2000, the only remaining foreign troops were Syrian. Immediately
after the resolution was adopted, I engaged in intense negotiations with President
Assad, who until the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafic Hariri on 14
February 2005, was consistently resistant to move on the issue. On 12 March 2005, I
was airborne with a small UN team, among them Fabrice Aidan, on my way to
Damascus for a new round of talks with the President. Midway, the captain informed
me that he was requested to change course and land in Aleppo. Afterwards I was told
that the reason was to avoid the media who were waiting for the arrival of the UN team
in Damascus. I was picked up at Aleppo airport by Walid Muallem, who was then
Deputy Foreign Minister. He brought me to Assad’s villa, where a few hours of
negotiations resulted in the Aleppo understanding, which outlined Syria’s military
withdrawal from Lebanon with specific timelines. Assad honored his word, and
ended twenty-nine years of Syrian military presence in Lebanon consistent with
Resolution 1559.

What is often forgotten in the recurrent doom and gloom in the Middle East, is that
the step-by-step approach, which started with the Camp David Accords of 1978, has
for more than thirty years led to conflict resolution: peace between Israel and Egypt; the
Oslo Accords; the mutual recognition of Israel and the PLO; the establishment of the
Palestinian Authority in Gaza and the West Bank, which still functions with its
presidency, cabinet, and ministries; peace between Israel and Jordan in 1994, with
the recognition of borders and a long-lasting security cooperation; Israel’s withdrawal
from Southern Lebanon in 2000; and the subsequent Syrian military withdrawal five
years later; as well as Israel’s pull out from the Gaza Strip. All these steps would have
been difficult, if not impossible, without the previous ones.

In 2000 the attempts to put a final end to the Syrian-Israeli and the Palestinian—
Israeli conflicts both failed. This exposes the risks of a totalist approach to solving such

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016174.txt,"Real estate: NTP positive but not enough

The Saudi residential sector is suffering an acute housing shortage which we estimate
at c1.2mn homes. Key reasons are:

e 1) Land is expensive: land constitutes as much as 50% of the cost of a housing
unit which is more than double the typical 20-25% in more affordable areas
globally.

e 2) Affordability issue: banks are reluctant to provide mortgages to workers from
the private sector.

e 3) Limited financing: the Real Estate Development Fund (REDF) which used to
provide interest-free loans to eligible Saudis for home purchase or construction, has
been unable to cope with the demand for new loans and has a backlog of about
450,000 applicants. The housing ministry is looking to issue Islamic bonds to help
fund the country’s REDF at the end of 2017.

e 4) Overrun development costs: Long delays for construction approval and permits
translate to overrun costs which create obstacles for developers to launch
economically feasible projects.

A persisting shortage of affordable residential supply

The shortage of housing is not a new phenomenon - it has been ongoing for decades.
The demand outlook from end-users is solid. Domestic household formation (marriages)
is a large component: newly married Saudi couples need an affordable place to live. With
market demand growing by 105K units pa (BofAMLe), we believe the shortage of supply
will persist for the following reasons:

e The limited scalability of residential projects — Dar Al Arkan is the largest
residential developer with only a 1% potential market share (delivery capability of
1,100 units pa).

e The capital-intensive Saudi financing model — without funding support from the
government and a virtually non-existent off-plan sales market, Saudi developers
have to secure funding to undertake larger residential projects. Dar Al Arkan is
having to lever up, as land sales, which were once the primary source of funding,
are no longer enough to enable it to scale up.

¢ A lack of incentives for large regional developers to enter the market — the
dearth of off-plan sales has dried up the cash flows of developers and limited their
ability to finance new projects and, in the worst cases, ongoing projects.
Furthermore, the profitability of affordable housing projects is not compelling
enough to attract developers to the Kingdom.

Fragmented Saudi residential market

Some 75% of new housing supply is from individuals and micro-home builders. This
trend highlights Saudis’ preference for building their own homes and illustrates the
immature profile of the real estate market in Saudi Arabia. Sovereign actions in
neighbouring countries, like the UAE, have boosted the sector (land granted to
developers, capital flows from international investors). We see big developers becoming
more active in the Kingdom but the effects on supply will not be immediate, in our view.
So far, they represent only 15% of the total market.

Key strategic objectives and KPIs to watch

e The Ministry of Housing is looking to: 1) improve performance of the real estate
sector and increase its contribution to the GDP; and, 2) enable citizens to obtain a
suitable residence. The ministry targets by 2020 to: 1) double the real estate sector

An answer came three months later from his Moscow lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena. On
September 23, 2013, Kucherena had an extensive interviewed on the state owned RT channel.
The interviewer Sophie Shevardnadze, who had a show on RT Television, called “Sophie & Co,”
was well-admired journalist in her own right. She is also the grand-daughter of Edward
Shevardnadze, a former foreign minister and Politburo member of the Soviet Union and, after the
Soviet Union broke up, the first president of Georgia. Even though she had interviewed many top
political figures in Russia, obtaining an hour-long interview with Kucherena was a coup since, up
until then, he had not discussed the subject in Snowden in a television interview. About half-way
through the interview, she brought up a highly-sensitive subject of the disposition of the NSA
documents. She directly asked Kucherena if Snowden given all the documents he had taken from
the NSA to journalists in Hong Kong.

If anyone was in a position to know about these documents, it was Kucherena. He had acted
as an intermediary for Snowden in his negotiations with Russian authorities, including the FSB.
As such, he would be privy to the status of the secret material that was of immense concern to the
Russian intelligence services. When I interviewed Kucherena in Moscow in 2015, he told me
that “all the reports” concerning Snowden had been turned over to him by “Russian authorities” in
July 2013. “I had all of Snowden’s statements,” he said. If so, he presumably knew what Snowden
had told the Russian security services prior

Had Snowden come to Russia with empty hands or bearing gifts? Kucherena answered her
question without any evasion. He said that Snowden had only given “some” of the NSA’s
documents in his possession to journalists in Hong Kong. He had kept the remaining documents
in his possession. That confirmed what Snowden had told Greenwald. Poitras and Lam in Hong
Kong. Snowden told them that he had divided the stolen NSA documents into two separate sets
of documents. One set he gave to Poitras and Greenwald on thumb drives. The other set, which
he told them that he considered too sensitive for these journalists, he retained for himself. As late
as July 14, 2013, Greenwald told the Associated Press that Snowden held back documents and
“Is in possession of literally thousands of documents ... that would allow somebody who
read them to know exactly how the NSA does what it does, which would in turn allow them
to evade that surveillance or replicate it. One issue for U.S. investigators at the NSA, CIA
and Department of Defense was what Snowden did with the second set afer his meetings with
the journalists in Hong Kong. Did he take these documents with him to Russia?

Shevardnadze, who makes it a point to drill her interviewees, pressed Kucherena as to whether
Snowden still had these NSA files, or “material” in Russia. The dialogue went as follows (from
the transcript supplied to me by Shevardnadze.)

Shevardnadze: So he [Snowden] does have some materials that haven’t been
made public yet?

Kucherena: Certainly.

`Blahblahs' forbidden in 'Radical Breakthroughs'. So we need two replacements (for Multiverse as Science

Initial ideas: 
* Expand the first episode Mathematics and Truth into two or likely three episodes. I'm intrigued by this 
because there is so much rich material - pure math, philosophy (discovered or invented), physics (Wigner's 
'unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences)', astrophysics, cosmology, biology, general 
systems theory. I've felt frustrated in this first episode because there is so much material. I think three episodes 
could work - if you agree, I'll get back to you with a suggested structure of the 2 or likely 3 parts. Also, Closer 
To Truth has had only a few videos and one episode on mathematics per se (out of 277 episodes!), so 
this would be original and complementary. In this may, math would become about half the series. 
* Integrated Information Theory - quantifying and explaining consciousness (Giulio Tononi, Un of Wisconsin-
Madison), plus supporters and critics. New controversial, science-based radical theory. 
* Evolutionary Dynamics - your program at Harvard - mathematical models. This is not an area of my 
expertise, but it could well fit Closer To Truth in general and Radical Breakthroughs in particular. But you 
need to tell me if you would like to include this. 
* Replicability Crisis - Problems in Statistics in Search for Truth. Deep problems of replicability in biomedical 
and especially psychological research - the scandal in recent years. See links and attachments.

Fig. 4.4: High-level architecture of DeSTIN

brain is a massively parallel fabric, in which computation processes and memory storage are
highly distributed. But massive parallelism is not in itself a solution — one also needs the right
architecture; which DeSTIN provides, building on prior work in the area of deep learning.

Humanlike intelligence is heavily adapted to the physical environments in which humans
evolved; and one key aspect of sensory data coming from our physical environments is its
hierarchical structure. However, most machine learning and pattern recognition systems are
“shallow” in structure, not explicitly incorporating the hierarchical structure of the world in
their architecture. In the context of perceptual data processing, the practical result of this is
the need to couple each shallow learner with a pre-processing stage, wherein high-dimensional
sensory signals are reduced to a lower-dimension feature space that can be understood by the
shallow learner. The hierarchical structure of the world is thus crudely captured in the hierarchy
of “preprocessor plus shallow learner.” In this sort of approach, much of the intelligence of the
system shifts to the feature extraction process, which is often imperfect and always application-
domain specific.

Deep machine learning has emerged as a more promising framework for dealing with complex,
high-dimensional real-world data. Deep learning systems possess a hierarchical structure that
intrinsically biases them to recognize the hierarchical patterns present in real-world data. Thus,
they hierarchically form a feature space that is driven by regularities in the observations, rather
than by hand-crafted techniques. They also offer robustness to many of the distortions and
transformations that characterize real-world signals, such as noise, displacement, scaling, etc.

Deep belief networks [HOTO06] and Convolutional Neural Networks [LBDE90] have been
demonstrated to successfully address pattern inference in high dimensional data (e.g. images).
They owe their success to their underlying paradigm of partitioning large data structures into
smaller, more manageable units, and discovering the dependencies that may or may not exist

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021307.txt,"mutually reinforcing leading to
synchrony.

In any dynamic social situation
observing one person’s action can
initiate neural activity in another. Parts
of the observer’s motor system become
activated, making it possible to respond
in synchrony. In fact, the specific actions
that are observed are not as important as
the perceived goals or intentions of the
observed person. One consequence of
this is that a person is sensitive to new
actions in the social environment. A
second is that significant actions by
another person can quickly produce
complementary motor responses. Thus,
adaptive social behavior is a product of
perceptual monitoring and motor
processes. The complexity of the social
environment necessitates selective
responding to socially significant
features of any social interaction. Such
selective responding depends on the
observer having particular goals for
action. The identification of significant
stimuli (e.g., a threatening backhand
smash) activates in the competitor’s
brain goal-driven decision processes that
operate in parallel with continuous social
monitoring and lead to a counteraction
(e.g., a defensive lob) produced by the
motor system. However, a linesman
collecting a ball during a tennis match
does not constitute a significant action
for the competition and, even if
observed, does not initiate any
counteraction.

Let us now return to the
perspective of a spectator at the tennis
match. While the specific movements
driving the tennis match have significant
implications for the players’ actions,
these movements have a different
implication for the spectator from whom
no overt responses are warranted. If an
observed action produced by someone

Page |6l

else does not have personal significance
for an observer, the motor system does
not respond in the same way at all’. The
goal-dependent aspect of observing the
actions of others allows us to understand
and respond quickly and effectively
without confusing what we do with what
we see. However, in some special cases,
when a group of individuals all respond
together, the same motor system may
operate differently. It is in these
situations when we are neither observer
nor respondent but part of a flock or
chorus that our sense of individuated self
may begin to dissolve into the larger
social group.

The Social Parameters for Suspended
Self-Consciousness

The dissolution of self-other
boundaries is likely to be manifest under
a specific set of conditions, which
includes a strong feeling of identification
with (i.e., connection between) oneself
and a group of others, the absence of
constraints to action by oneself or the
observed others, a common goal shared
by the group, and the absence of a
recognized external synchronizing signal
to which one can attribute any
synchronized behavior. Clapping in
unison following a rousing performance
is amore common example. This
remarkable phenomenon is evidenced
despite considerable individual
differences in clapping tempos. The
transition to entrained clapping, whereby
each clapper affects the surrounding
other clappers both locally and globally,
enhances the noise intensity at the
moment of the clapping even though it
leads to a decrease in the overall average
noise intensity in the room.
Synchronized behavior occurs
rhythmically and one way of capturing
its regularities is to model its cycles,
periods, frequencies, and amplitudes '”.

machine that Morris Jr. created was madeentirely of software. It took the form ofa
compact, simply designed computer program he’d written and designed to spread
quickly and easily on the young systems of the Internet. It ran a mere 99 lines, took
most computers nanoseconds to execute and it worked like this: The program - it
later became known as a “worm” by the police who would come to find and arrest
Morris Jr. - would find an open door on a network-connected computer. (In 1988,
the pre-Warez Dude era, finding such doors was not difficult. Finding locked doors
was probably harder.) Once Morris’ program had slithered inside and loaded itself
onto the machine, like a dog slipping through an unattended puppy door, it would
sniff around, rattle a few more doors to find any passwords that had been left
unsecured. Then it would move on to the next machine. Knock, knock. Rattle, rattle.
Next machine. Morris designed his code to simply repeat this process over and over.
Filling, as a result, each machine’s memory with multiple, peformance-deadening
copies of the same program. A house full of puppies, in a sense. After several hours
of this flu-like spread, a wave of unplanned, unending computation began choking
the net.

Morris later explained he’d only meant his program as a demonstration, as a test of
sorts. He wanted to show how machines might be made more safe. But he seemed to
grasp, almost immediately, that he’d made a mistake and that the worm was
running away from him. He emailed a friend: How the hell to stop it? His friend had
no idea either. They scrambled at least to warn system administrators about the
dangerous code that would shortly devour their machines. “There may be a virus
loose on the Internet,” they wrote. But that note, in a bit of bad luck, was
quarantined inside a Harvard computer that had already been unplugged. So, a few
hours after Morris released his code, unwarned and unprepared, the Internet froze.
212 On November 2¢ and 3rd, 1988 machines around the world were shut off, cables
were pulled out of walls, and systems were wiped and restarted in a race to stop the
robot-like spread of the disease and then to finally kill it off. 213

The Morris Worm was, on those fall 1988 days, acting out a sober-minded insight of
the famed biological historian Alfred Crosby: “The nineteenth century was followed
by the twentieth century, which was followed by the...nineteenth century.”214
Crosby meant that our age of topological connection meant we were back, again, in
an age of infections. And this was true: Morris program was mapping out, like an
epidemic, new routes in the age of high-speed digital contagion. But - and this is
why we care about it here - by the time it reached “peak infection”, the worm was

The irony behind all this is that Medicare doesn’ t cover any dental

illness in other, internal parts of the body. For example, a research team
from Columbia University’ s School of Public Health released the results of
a three-year study of 420 men and women, concluding that the
improvement of gum health can help slow the development of

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012773.txt,"predictable. This unpredictability is partially responsible for changes in the brain. Promiscuous mating
systems demand more flexibility, creativity and out of the box thinking.

The anthropologist Steve Gaulin explored the idea that a species’ mating system is directly
related to its capacity to think. Gaulin started by looking at two closely related species of voles, one
monogamous and the other polygynous. In the polygynous vole, males typically mate with multiple
females. To achieve this kind of mating success, males have large territories that encompass many
smaller female territories. In the monogamous species, the male and female share the same territory, with
mating restricted to the couple. These differences in mating system and space usage have two direct
consequences: relative to the monogamous male vole, the polygynous male vole must travel much further
in a day than the females and must recall where the female territories are located. For a polygynous male
vole, mating success depends on long day trips, visiting each of the female territories. For the
monogamous male vole, there are no physical or memory challenges as the female is virtually always
nearby. Given the costs to a polygynous male vole of forgetting where the females live, there should be
strong selection on the memory system. Gaulin confirmed this prediction by showing that polygynous
male voles outcompete females of their species in a maze running competition, and also have larger
memory systems than females. In the monogamous vole, there are no sex differences in maze running or
memory.

Gaulin’s work provides a gorgeous example of how evolutionary pressures can act on the brain to
create differences in psychological capacity. Other examples abound, including evidence that fruit eaters
have larger brains than leaf eaters, primates living in large social groups have larger frontal lobes than
those living in smaller groups, and bats living in open habitats have smaller brains than those living in
complex closed habitats. In each case, a particular ecological or social pressure — finding ripe fruit,
updating the status of numerous social relationships, avoiding obstacles while in flight — sculpts
differences in brain anatomy and function. Some of these pressures favor extreme specialization and
myopia, whereas others favor a broader vision. Relative to every healthy member of our species, all other
animals have tunnel vision. When our ancestors began to migrate out of Africa, the diversity of
environments and social opportunities favored generalists with a broad and flexible vision.

To appreciate the significance of the human revolution in brain engineering, consider three cases
of myopic, but highly adaptive intelligence in other animals, cases that lack the signature of intellectual
promiscuity; these cases are of particular interest because they represent the kinds of examples that
caused Darwin to doubt the beneficence of God, to reflect upon the cruelty of nature, and to ponder the
problem of evil:

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019420.txt,"While the decision to go seems to have technically been Ballmer’s, interviews with dozens of people inside and outside the
company, including many close to the situation, indicate that he had not aimed to leave this soon and especially after the
recent restructuring of the company that he had intensely planned.

Instead, sources said Ballmer’s timeline had been moved up drastically — first by him and then the nine-member board,
including his longtime partner and Microsoft co-founder and chairman Bill Gates — after all agreed that it was best if he left
sooner than later.

That was due to a number of increasingly problematic issues on the immediate horizon — including a potentially nasty proxy
fight, continued business performance declines and, perhaps most of all, that Ballmer’s leadership was becoming a very
obvious lightning rod.

Interestingly, Ballmer actually indicated that he had planned on staying in his letter about his impending departure, noting:
“My original thoughts on timing would have had my retirement happen in the middle of our transformation to a devices and
services company focused on empowering customers in the activities they value most.”

That sentence spurred much chatter inside the company, including the persistent rumor that Gates had dropped the bomb
on Ballmer. That sentiment was further underscored when Ballmer’s letter contained no reference or thanks to Gates, with
whom he has been tightly tethered over the last several decades. Its absence has been much discussed internally at
Microsoft, where ithas been seen as an unusual slight and a sign of a rift.

Gates also did not reference his longtime business partner in any celebratory manner in Microsoft's announcement. “Asa
member of the succession planning committee, I'll work closely with the other members of the board to identify a great new
CEO,” said Gates, in the entirety of the quote about Ballmer’s retirement. “We’re fortunate to have Steve in his role until the
new CEO assumes these duties.”

Other sources cautioned that it was not indicative of tensions between the pair, but was done to minimize “lame duck
concerns’ that might arise if Ballmer was portrayed as already out the door.

Those sources also insist that Gates never asked Ballmer to step down sooner, although they acknowledge that he also did
not — as Gates had in the past — disagree that it was best that he move on.

“Did Gates instigate it? No,” said one source with knowledge of the situation. “But was he as supportive of Ballmer as he had
been in the past? Maybe not.”

That was still a big change, of course. Gates — who has always been and remains the key decision-maker on Microsoft's
board — had always been Ballmer’s major backer, despite increasing pressure both externally and from other directors for
him to step down.

Gates had rejected such suggestions for years. That included former director and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, who many
sources said had been one of the first to urge that the company replace Ballmer as CEO, as well as from a spate of Wall
Street investors complaining about the company’s declining value in the Ballmer years.

As AllThingsD’s John Paczkowski wrote on Friday: “Here’s one metric by which Ballmer will be judged harshly. On the last
day of 1999, the day before he took over as CEO, Microsoft’s market capitalization was $600 billion. On the day before he
announced his intention to retire, it was less than $270 billion.”

That’s a damning number, of course, coupled with a widespread sentiment that Ballmer had missed critical trends in tech
under his tenure. Despite a strong growth in revenue, investors and others had long concluded that Microsoft had thrived
when Gates was CEO and waned under Ballmer’s rule.

Still, until recently, there has been no signal from the company indicating any change in top leadership. In fact, the
management reorganization backed strongly by the board a month ago had essentially placed Ballmer at the center of the
structure under a plan described as “One Microsoft.”

And, at the time of the restructuring announcement in July, Ballmer’s definite and clear message was that he was there to
stay:

“Lots of change. Butin all of this, many key things remains the same. Our incredible people, our spirit, our commitment, our
belief in the transformative power of technology — our Microsoft technology — to make the world a better place for billions
of people and millions of businesses around the world. It’s why | come to work inspired every day. It’s why we’ve evolved
before, and why we're evolving now. Because we’re not done. Let’s go.”

Though early in its rollout, the changes have been jarring and created a level of chaos at the company that has led to much
grumbling internally. It also did not help that the restructuring was quickly followed by a dismal Q4 performance by Microsoft.

On October 27, 2009, Florida’s governor, Charlie Crist, left Scott
Rothstein a voice-mail message.

“Hey, Scott,” the governor said. “It’s Charlie, your favorite
Greek governor. Hope you're doing well, buddy. Just wanted to
touch base and let you know I’m working Versace for November
twenty-fourth, and it is going amazingly well— unbelievable,
brother. ...Really enjoyed again seeing you and Kimmie and

me. We love you. Take care. Bye-bye.”

That same day, Rothstein took a chartered Gulfstream V to
Casablanca, Morocco. For a while, it seemed as if Rothstein was
running. But a few days later, the same Gulfstream returned to
Fort Lauderdale. The Ponzi king had decided to turn himself in.

The moment he did, he started to sing like a canary in return

the Nikkei the day of the US election and sell when the opposite e.g. bonds and
defensive equities shortly after Brexit. Our CTI models did actually pick up a number of
those events as the table below shows. It also got picked up by our standard deviation
analysis. We acted on some but not all of these readings. The lesson, with the benefit of

We think 2017 is another year where investors will need to be nimble. Markets have
responded enthusiastically to a prospective Trump Presidency but as the above charts
suggest we may well have discounted much of it. That is also supported by our fixed
income and FX forecasts, which suggest much has already been priced in. In addition we
have political risk starting with next weekend’s Italian referendum stretching to the
German elections in Autumn 2017. In the middle we have the crucial French elections. A

Euro Stoxx (27 June): 217 (last month: 215)
UBS View Euro Stoxx (6-month target): 223
¢ The crisis in the Eurozone will remain the main driver in the coming months. After the elections in
Greece, progress on the reform program will be closely monitored. Spain and Italy will also remain in the
spotlight with levels of government bond yields too high for being sustainable.
¢ With the sovereign debt crisis dragging on we expect the Eurozone market to stay highly volatile in
coming months.
e Economies in peripheral countries increasingly feel the burden of austerity. The economic weakness
affects company earnings negatively. Analysts’ earnings growth forecasts (consensus) for 2012 have come
down to about 3% for this year, but we see this as still too high against the weak economic backdrop.
¢ All in all, the ongoing risks stemming from the sovereign debt crisis lead us to the view that Eurozone
equities will underperform other major markets.

A Positive scenario Euro Stoxx (6-month target): 275
¢ Global economic growth reaccelerates and Eurozone growth shows clear signs of bottoming out,
enabling 2-4% earnings growth over the rest of the year. The trailing P/E ratio could re-rate to 12x from
the current reading close to 10x.

& Negative scenario Euro Stoxx (6-month target): 165
¢ Europe slides into a deep recession, and the debt crisis leads to severe pressure on Spain and Italy. In a
major crisis, earnings could fall by 10% to 15% from current levels until year-end, and the trailing P/E ratio
could drop to 8.5x by the end of 2012.

with state statutes and constitutional provisions that seek to guarantee victims' rights. However, these efforts have failed to fully
safeguard victims’ rights. These significant state efforts simply are not sufficiently consistent, comprehensive, or authoritative
to safeguard victims' rights. ©

To place victims’ rights in the Constitution, victims advocates - led most prominently by the National Victims Constitutional

Amendment Network % - approached the President and Congress regarding a federal amendment. © On April 22, 1996,
Senators Kyl and Feinstein with the backing of President Clinton introduced a federal victims' rights amendment. © The
amendment was intended to restore, preserve, and protect, as a matter of right for the victims of violent crimes, the practice of
victim participation in the administration of criminal justice that was the birthright of every American at the founding of our
Nation. ©” A companion resolution was introduced in the House of Representatives. ©8 The proposed amendment embodied
seven core principles: (1) the right to notice of proceedings, (2) the right to be present at the proceedings, (3) the right to be
heard, (4) the right to notice of the defendant's [*849] release or escape, (5) the right to restitution, (6) the right to a speedy
trial, and (7) the right to reasonable protection. In a later resolution, an eighth principle was added: the right to standing to
enforce these rights. ©? The 104th Congress did not pass the amendment.

On January 21, 1997, the opening day of the first session of the 105th Congress, Senators Kyl and Feinstein reintroduced the
victims’ rights amendment. ™ A series of hearings were held that year in both the House and the Senate. 7! Kyl and Feinstein
reintroduced the amendment the following year. 7* The Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings 73 and passed the proposed
amendment out of committee. 4 Yet again, the full Senate did not consider the amendment.

In 1999, Senators Kyl and Feinstein again proposed the amendment, > and on September 30, 1999, the Judiciary Committee
voted, as before, to send the amendment to the full Senate. 7 But on April 27, 2000, after three days of floor debate, the
amendment was shelved when it became clear that its opponents, who objected to constitutionalizing victims’ rights, possessed

the necessary votes to sustain a filibuster. 77 At the same time, hearings on the companion measure were held in the House. 7°

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018411.txt,"So though no inherent enmity exists between the two countries, a crack emerges.
Each side finds reasons not to cooperate. A shared interest in peace - neither side
wants a collision, both understand the costs - is shimmied apart by a perception
gap. Cultural, historical, temperamental and ideological differences accelerate the
unzipping of even the best intentions. Misunderstanding bends and then snaps
irrevocably into mistrust. So yes, the recovered islands and the trade tensions and
the political theories have to be managed because each is a blister that limits
forward motion - but the real source of friction? It is the scraping of different world
views. This is deep strategic misalignment. It is, in fact, the stuff of war.

In recent years, America has had two different, nearly opposite approaches to China,
each however marked by an assured national confidence that the current world
order is sustainable. One policy is short-handed as “engagement” - or, colloquially,
“panda hugging.” As China becomes more prosperous, this approach suggests, she
will become more congenial to American interests. More cuddly. This was, for some,
the basis for bringing China into the World Trade Organization in the 1990s. Later it
justified deep commercial links and educational ties. The logic of such an approach
fit the mindset of many baby-boomer Americans: China’s attraction to MTV,
McDonalds and Mercedes hinted at a still deeper desire they thought. To be
Western. China’s citizens would surely become more attracted and committed to the
world system that had delivered all this prosperity. The country would become
more global, in a sense, and /ess Chinese.

In fact, as China has grown in recent years she has become more global and more
Chinese. Growth, wealth, an admixture of confidence into the old national habit of
insecurity - all of these have encouraged a searching exploration. The demands of
domestic politics, the instincts of the Chinese Communist Party and the inevitable
practical questions of security and reform all produce sensible questions. China
needs oil, for instance. Must she project power into the Middle East? Control the sea
lanes of the Malacca Straits? There’s no natural, inherent resistance to American
interests in any one problem, but that hopeful American logic of “engagement”
ignores much about China’s essence. The country presses at rules she mistrusts (as
America once did). She struggles with the inevitable challenges of a political system
still smoking a bit from recent revolutions - and, of course, facing the pressures of a
networked age. But she holds, strongly, a sense of Chineseness. Can we honestly
expect to use mere prosperity to change China in a predictable, pro-American way?
“Engagement” feels to Chinese like a demand to become more American. That
prospect is as appealing as a request to become more Chinese would be for
Americans.

An alterative strategy to “engagment” is known as “containment”. (While not
formally called “Panda Kicking”, this is often what this policy looks like.) This view
takes it for granted that as China becomes more powerful she will become a threat.
Any growth in Chinese power means a decline in America’s influence and security. A
stronger China in Asia, for instance, means a weaker America. Countries like Japan
or Korea or the Philippines will be required to choose a side at some point, at some
awful 21st Century Melian moment. The aim of containment is to squelch China

policies, which provided that charitable donations gener-
ally should be made to healthcare institutions and relate to
the practice of medicine.’”

Proper due diligence and controls are critical for
charitable giving. In general, the adequacy of measures
taken to prevent misuse of charitable donations will depend
on a risk-based analysis and the specific facts at hand. In
Opinion Procedure Release No. 10-02, DOJ described the
due diligence and controls that can minimize the likelihood
of an FCPA violation. In that matter, a Eurasian-based sub-
sidiary of a U.S. non-governmental organization was asked
by an agency of a foreign government to make a grant to
a local microfinance institution (MFI) as a prerequisite to
the subsidiary’s transformation to bank status. The subsid-
iary proposed contributing $1.42 million to a local MFI to
satisfy the request. The subsidiary undertook an extensive,
three-stage due diligence process to select the proposed
grantee and imposed significant controls on the proposed
grant, including ongoing monitoring and auditing, ear-
marking funds for capacity building, prohibiting compen-
sation of board members, and implementing anti-corrup-
tion compliance provisions. DOJ explained that it would
not take any enforcement action because the company’s due
diligence and the controls it planned to put in place sufficed
to prevent an FCPA violation.

Other opinion releases also address charitable-type
grants or donations. Under the facts presented in those
releases, DOJ approved the proposed grant or donation,'™
based on due diligence measures and controls such as:

e certifications by the recipient regarding compliance
with the FCPA;!

e due diligence to confirm that none of the recipient’s
officers were affiliated with the foreign government
at issue;1

* arequirement that the recipient provide audited
financial statements;!°

* awritten agreement with the recipient restricting

the use of funds;'”

® steps to ensure that the funds were transferred to a

valid bank account;!”

19

e confirmation that the charity's commitments were

109 and

met before funds were disbursed;
* on-going monitoring of the efficacy of the
program.!!°
Legitimate charitable giving does not violate the
FCPA. Compliance with the FCPA merely requires that
charitable giving not be used as a vehicle to conceal pay-

ments made to corruptly influence foreign officials.

Five Questions to Consider When Making
Charitable Payments in a Foreign Country:

1. What is the purpose of the payment?

2. Is the payment consistent with the company’s
internal guidelines on charitable giving?

3. Is the payment at the request of a foreign official?

4. Is a foreign official associated with the charity
and, if so, can the foreign official make decisions
regarding your business in that country?

5. Is the payment conditioned upon receiving
business or other benefits?

Who Is a Foreign Official?

The FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions apply to corrupt
payments made to (1) “any foreign official’; (2) “any foreign
political party or official thereof”; (3) “any candidate for
foreign political office”; or (4) any person, while knowing
that all ora portion of the payment will be offered, given, or
promised to an individual falling within one of these three
categories.'' Although the statute distinguishes between a
“foreign official, “foreign political party or official thereof?
and “candidate for foreign political office” the term “for-
eign official” in this guide generally refers to an individual
falling within any of these three categories.

The FCPA defines “foreign official” to include:

any officer or employee of a foreign government or

any department, agency, or instrumentality thereof,

FAL CHAPTER Ill Cannabis Industry Segmentation
potency, moisture content and the presence of contaminants, such as residual solvents, heavy met-
als, mycotoxins, microorganisms and pesticides. Testing, labeling and certification requirements vary
widely across jurisdictions, but increasingly are being required by state law and demanded by supply-
chain intermediaries and consumers. Uniform standards for testing and reporting are expected to
emerge as scientific understanding of cannabis increases and as industry consensus about cannabis-
related health and safety concerns develops.

Providers of extraction, manufacturing and testing services generally must obtain state and local
cannabis licenses and are exposed to risks related to federal legal violations.

Composition and Potency

Laboratories ordinarily test cannabis for the specific amounts of 10 to 15 cannabinoids and more than
30 terpenes. Cultivators and production intermediaries rely on these test results to identify and track
cannabis varieties and to monitor the quality and consistency of production methods. Retailers and
consumers use test results information to assist in purchasing decisions. Almost all consumer products
now include labeling that, at a minimum, indicates the amounts of THC and CBD.

Pesticides

Controlling and disclosing the presence of pesticides in cannabis products is increasingly becoming
a focus of regulators and producers. Even cannabis grown under organic conditions can be exposed
to pesticides inadvertently, so many states now require all cannabis products to be tested by a state-
licensed laboratory for pesticides. Pesticides can be especially problematic in cannabis concentrates;
studies have shown extraction processes may concentrate pesticides at a rate higher than cannabinoids
and terpenes.

Microbiological Organisms

Certain molds, other fungi and bacteria found in and on the cannabis plant can damage the plant
or certain cannabis products and can be harmful if consumed by humans. Mold is a problem most
commonly found in indoor growing environments and during the cannabis drying and curing process.
Organisms found in cannabis and identified by testing includes aspergillus, salmonella, pseudomonas
and E.coli.

Residual Solvents

Most extraction processes use solvents to extract the active compounds from cannabis plant material.
Commonly used solvents include butane, carbon dioxide, ethanol or propane. Residual solvents are
those trace amounts of solvents that remain in a cannabis concentrate after the extraction process.
Some residual solvents can be harmful if consumed by humans in sufficient amounts, and others
should not be consumed in any amount.

ask, don’ t tell” policy that you promised to rescind, only you haven’ t
been acting like a Commander-in-Chief. All you have to do is sign such a
directive. Those who serve in the military are trained to follow orders. If
they can follow orders to kill fellow humans, they can certainly follow
orders to treat openly gay service people with total equality.

Not only is the current guideline counterproductive, but also this
display of trickle-down immorality must, on some level of consciousness,
serve as a contributing factor to enabling the anti-gay bullying and
torturing of innocent victims. | know, you don’ t want to take a chance
that retracting the policy would interfere with your re-election. You’ ve
made the point that you don’ t want Mitt Romney to win in 2012 and turn
around all the good things you’ ve accomplished.

Incidentally, Romney had wanted to overturn Roe vs. Wade, yet, in
1994, when he was running for the Senate, he came out in favor of choice
for women. However, freelance journalist Suzan Mazur revealed that he
admitted to Mormon feminist Judith Dushku that “the Brethren” in Salt
Lake City to/d him he could take a pro-choice position, and that in fact he
probably had to in order to win in a liberal state like Massachusetts.

Pandering trumps religious belief.

Key questions

e Will the economic outlook deteriorate? Will QE3 become necessary?

e How will the election outcome change fiscal policy deliberations?

© Can politicians find an agreement to avoid sharp fiscal contraction in early 2013 (fiscal cliff)?

CIO View (Probability: 65%*) No QE3, political gridlock and some fiscal tightening
¢ The economy stays on a moderate growth path, coupled with stable core PCE inflation close to the Fed’s
target of 2%. UBS forecasts real GDP growth of 1.5% in 2Q 2012 (consensus: 2.1%) and 2.3% in 3Q 2012
(consensus: 2.4%), with some downside risk due to rising uncertainty. The Fed has decided to extend so
called Operation Twist until the end of the year. More near-term monetary easing is still possible, but it
is currently not our central scenario.

¢ In the elections, Republicans will likely lose seats in the House overall, but retain a majority; we also
expect them to win a narrow majority in the Senate. Obama will likely retain the White House. Such an
electoral outcome would confirm the existing gridlock between Republicans and Democrats.

e Against the backdrop of ongoing political gridlock, we expect only moderate fiscal tightening of about
0.9% of GDP in 2013. The government will likely let unemployment benefits and the payroll tax cut expire,
but postpone income tax hikes and sequestration spending.

A Positive scenario (Probability: 10%*) No QE3, Democratic sweep and more fiscal tightening

¢ Propelled by ultra-expansive monetary policy and improved confidence, cyclical forces surmount the
structural hindrances and thus growth accelerates. More rapid growth leads to higher inflation, and the
Fed responds by tightening monetary policy sooner.

¢ The improved economic outlook raises the odds for an Obama re-election and makes it harder for
Republicans to win a majority in the Senate. US fiscal consolidation efforts are facilitated by faster rising
tax collections. A Democratic stronghold leads to some tax hikes and limited spending cuts. Fiscal policy
tightens by about 1.2% of GDP in 2013.
Negative scenario (Probability: 25%*)
¢ Structural hindrances dominate and weigh on the cyclical recovery, thus growth weakens or turns
negative. The Fed embarks on QE3, most likely in the form of agency MBS and Treasury purchases.

e Weaker economic conditions raise the odds for a larger Republican majority in Congress, but Obama
remains President. The debt limit is reached earlier and the Treasury runs out of money before year-end.
The political gridlock becomes dysfunctional, thus fiscal policy tightens by USD 600 billion (3.7% of UBS
estimate of 2013 GDP) in 2013 (“fiscal cliff”). The US credit rating is downgraded.

2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *871

must review that [*872] statement. !7? Finally, before an Arizona court accepts a plea, the prosecutor must advise the court

that reasonable efforts were made to confer with the victim about the plea and the victim's view regarding it. !74

The rule proposed here is narrower than these state formulations: it requires only that a prosecutor confer with the victim about
the plea and inform the court if the victim objects. For many significant categories of federal cases (e.g., typical drug
trafficking offenses, felons in possession of a firearm, etc.), there will be no victim, much less a victim objection. In such cases,
to require some sort of victim inquiry by the court or victim certification by the prosecutor would unnecessarily waste time.
The proposed rule requires only that the prosecutor report a victim's objection - in which case the court will presumably want to
more carefully consider whether to accept a plea.

Rule 12.1 - Victim Addresses and Phone Numbers Not Disclosed for Alibi Purposes
The Proposal:

The Government currently must disclose the address and telephone numbers of any witnesses, including the victim, that it
plans to use to disprove an alibi. This rule should be changed to protect the victim's privacy, excluding their information from
this requirement.

(b) Disclosing Government Witnesses.

(1) Disclosure. If the defendant serves a Rule 12.1(a)(2) notice [regarding intent to present an alibi defense], an attorney for the
government must disclose in writing to the defendant or the defendant's attorney:

(A) the name, address, and telephone number of each witness and the address and telephone number of each witness (other than
a victim) that the government intends [*873] to rely on to establish the defendant's presence at the scene of the alleged
offense; and

(B) each government rebuttal witness to the defendant's alibi defense

(c) Continuing Duty to Disclose. Both an attorney for the government and the defendant must promptly disclose in writing to
the other party the name of each additional witness, and the address and telephone number of each additional witness (other
than a victim) if:

(1) the disclosing party learns of the witness before or during trial; and
(2) the witness should have been disclosed under Rule 12.1(a) or (b) if the disclosing party had known of the witness earlier.

In addition, a similar change should be made to Rule 12.3 regarding the addresses and telephone numbers of victims who will
be used to disprove a public-authority defense.

The Rationale:

This proposed change implements the victim's right to be reasonably protected from the accused. !7> The victim cannot be
reasonably protected if the defendant, without good reason, is given the victim's address and telephone number. The proposed
rule strikes the current requirement that the prosecutor must automatically give the defendant the victim's address and telephone

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018405.txt,"The goals of Hard Gatekeeping are simple enough to state: To protect those inside
the gated order, to make security and innovation more efficient, to accelerate
certain kinds of connection and dampen others, to manage vulnerable links to the
non-gatekept world and - perhaps most important- to use that “in or out” leverage
to relentlessly affect the interests and plans of others. These aims are the root of real
security in any age. “In anarchy, security is the highest end,” Kenneth Waltz wrote.
“Only if survival is assured can states seek other goals such as tranquility, profit and
power.”247 Survival - and Waltz’s other essential aims - will be decided by the
nature of our future connection. In this sense, Hard Gatekeeping produces a decisive
change in our posture. It lets us aim for something instead of merely being against
movement or - hopelessly - against the future. It establishes priorities, clarifies our
real core interests, helps us budget our effort and our expenses — better, perhaps, to
spend atrillon dollars building tools of topological mastery like infrastructure or
new technology than chasing Middle East peace.**® Gatekeeping does not transcend
the long-standing debates between the cold realism of Stalin and the idealism of
Woodrow Wilson so much as it sets us a preliminary task: Shaping the environment.
To build and control the next generation of gatekept systems should be our aim
now. In the future paper currency wil be replaced by secure digital bit transactions.
Genetic information will demand smart, live-connected platforms for efficient
mining and study. Cyber and biological security will each come to be defined by
high-speed, machine-intelligent protocols. All of these are gatekept cores. Mastering
them will be as important as having military bases, trade missions or treaty
arrangements once was. The development of such systems plays to our strengths;
they deliver both security and useful pressures of innovation. Remember - the aim
isn’t to build walls. It is to use the logic of networks and gates, and all the complex
productive force they release.

Bs
The elements of Hard Gatekeeping can be stated simply enough:

First, Does it work for us? We seek a landscape of technology, trade, finance,
knowledge - all the tools of power - that balances the pressures of politics with a
colder grasp of longer-term national interest. The protocols, alliances, treaties and
data webs that enable markets, trade or thinking machines - all are gatelands we
can cultivate, improve and protect. Our gatelands must be designed to limit the
rippling risks of contagion or error moving wildly, like spring weather, inside linked
complex systems now. Control of topologies is what air superiority or sea mastery
once were. The opening attacks of future wars will come invisibly and silently
through networks, in space, in fast topological strikes — not with noisy land
invasions or bombing runs. Well-built gates will give us time and leverage. They will

its anti-corruption and compliance policies, which it communicates to its new employees through required online and in-
person training in the local language. Company A also requires Company B’s third-party distributors and other agents to
sign anti-corruption certifications, complete training, and sign new contracts that incorporate FCPA and anti-corruption

representations and warranties and audit rights.

Based on these facts, would DOJ or SEC prosecute?

DOJ and SEC have declined to prosecute companies like Company A in similar circumstances. DOJ and SEC
encourage companies like Company A to conduct extensive FCPA due diligence. By uncovering the corruption, Company
A put itself in a favorable position, and, because the corrupt payments have stopped, Company A has no continuing
liability. Whether DOJ and SEC might charge Company B depends on facts and circumstances beyond the scope of this
hypothetical. DOJ would consider its Principles of Federal Prosecution of Business Organizations and SEC would consider
the factors contained in the Seaboard Report, both of which are discussed in Chapter 5. In general, the more egregious
and long-standing the corruption, the more likely it is that DOJ and SEC would prosecute Company B. In certain limited
circumstances, DOJ and SEC have in the past declined to bring charges against acquired companies, recognizing that

acquiring companies may bear much of the reputational damage and costs associated with such charges.

Scenario 2:

Company A plans to acquire Company B. Although, as in Scenario 1, Company A conducts extensive due diligence, it
does not uncover the bribery until after the acquisition. Company A then makes certain that the illegal payments stop and
voluntarily discloses the misconduct to DOJ and SEC. It quickly integrates Company B into Company A's own robust internal
controls, including its anti-corruption and compliance policies, which it communicates to its new employees through required
online and in-person training in the local language. Company A also requires Company B's third-party distributors and other
agents to sign anti-corruption certifications, complete training, and sign new contracts that incorporate FCPA and anti-

corruption representations and warranties and audit rights.

Based on these facts, would DOJ or SEC prosecute?

Absent unusual circumstances not contemplated by this hypothetical, DOJ and SEC are unlikely to prosecute
Company A for the pre-acquisition misconduct of Company B, provided that Company B still exists in a form that would
allow it to be prosecuted separately (e.g., Company B is a subsidiary of Company A). DOJ and SEC understand that no
due diligence is perfect and that society benefits when companies with strong compliance programs acquire and improve
companies with weak ones. At the same time, however, neither the liability for corruption—nor the harms caused by it—
are eliminated when one company acquires another. Whether DOJ and SEC will pursue a case against Company B (or, in
unusual circumstances, Company A) will depend on consideration of all the factors in the Principles of Federal Prosecution
of Business Organizations and the Seaboard Report, respectively.

Scenario 3:

Company A merges with Company B, which is in the same line of business and interacts with the same Foreign
Government customers, and forms Company C. Due diligence before the merger reveals that both Company A and
Company B have been engaging in similar bribery. In both cases, the bribery was extensive and known by high-level

management within the companies.

Based on these facts, would DOJ or SEC prosecute?

Yes. DOJ and SEC have prosecuted companies like Company C on the basis of successor liability. Company C is a
combination of two companies that both violated the FCPA, and their merger does not eliminate their liability. In addition,
since Company C is an ongoing concern, DOJ and SEC may impose a monitorship to ensure that the bribery has ceased

and a compliance program is developed to prevent future misconduct.

Cannabis Industry Segmentation

The nascent cannabis industry is often viewed by investors and others as a single, homogeneous indus-
try, in much the same way the “technology” industry was viewed in the early 1990s. As the technology
industry became more important to the global economy and was better understood by the investment
community, however, investment banks and other industry analysts tracked an increasing number of
discrete yet related industry segments. In the cannabis industry we are seeing a similar trend, which we
expect to continue as the industry evolves.

To help investors better evaluate investment opportunities in the cannabis industry, we currently
define five primary segments: production, distribution, consumer products, business solutions and
digital media. We further divide each segment into multiple subsegments. Each segment has unique
opportunities and risks. For example, companies that possess, manufacture or distribute cannabis
(commonly known as “touching the plant”) face risks related to violating federal law—and state-law
compliance obligations—not generally faced by providers of business software or digital media con-
tent. Many businesses operate in multiple segments, and we expect industry leaders to emerge in each
segment. The five primary segments and their subsegments are illustrated in the following chart.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014470.txt,"ae — a return to positive EPS growth
in 201

7% EPS growth in 2017 as global growth improves and Resources EPS recovers
We think the earnings backdrop will be supportive in 2017 with a return to positive EPS
growth in Europe for the first time since 2014 and with downside to consensus
forecasts for the year ahead that are well below average. Our base case assumes +7%
EPS growth in 2017 and 2018. With EPS broadly stagnant over the last 6 years,
investors might justifiably ask what is different this time. We see several reasons to
think mid to high single digit EPS growth is achievable next year.

Source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream, IBES Source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Markit, Bloomberg

Return to positive EPS growth feasible with global GDP at 3.5%... First, global
growth is accelerating and on our economists’ base case forecasts global GDP growth
will be 3.5%, the first materially above trend growth year since 2010. That is significant
for European earnings given a reasonably tight relationship to global GDP growth. 3%
represents the tipping point around which earnings growth tends to turn positive
according to our regression model. At the BofAML forecast of 3.5% global GDP growth,
7% EPS growth is implied as likely by the same model.

..as leading Indicators point to a synchronized global recovery. What gives us
confidence in this putative earnings recovery is the more synchronized nature of the
current recovery. All major regions of the world are showing momentum in growth
indicators for the first time in several years. One measure of the broad nature of the
improvement is manufacturing PMI surveys. Of 29 Markit PMIs 83% are currently above
50, highest since August 2014. More importantly, 79% have improved over the last 3
months — higher than at any point in the last three years.

Bull case of global GDP towards 4% would signal double digit EPS growth. To see a
more bullish outcome for EPS we would need to see global GDP accelerating further. Based
on our regression model, double digit EPS growth historically was consistent with global GDP
growth above 3.8%. Under our bull case scenario for 2017, with say 4.0% global GDP growth,
consensus EPS growth forecasts for +14% in Europe would become realistic.

PMs beyond 55 would suggest upside to base case. Significant further gains in
leading indicators would be a signal that earnings growth could exceed our base case.
Over the longer term EPS growth has followed manufacturing PMI surveys with a 9-
month lag approximately (using an average of US and Eurozone). Historically readings
above 55 were consistent with mid-teens EPS growth. The relationship has weakened in
recent years as low interest rates and weaker commodity prices weighed on earnings in
Financials and Resources. Nevertheless, in the last year of decent EPS growth in Europe
in 2014 the PMIs peaked at 54 so we would look for upside to our base case EPS
forecast should PMIs improve to the mid-50s level or beyond.

TIIC Group backed by Edmond de Rothschild, is a pan-European infrastructure firm advising on mid-market
infrastructure projects across Europe in both the transportation and social sectors. It was established in
2008 by the 3 founding partners of TIIC Group, Jaime d’Almeida, Manuel Cary and Francisco Mendes, with
strategic support from the Edmond de Rothschild Group and Brisa.

The aim of TIIC Group is to bring an operational approach to infrastructure investments in Europe, drawing
upon the extensive management and financial skills of its team members. These skills have been developed
over many years at some of Europe’s leading infrastructure operators and project financing firms which,
when combined with the very specific infrastructure expertise of both the Edmond de Rothschild Group and
Brisa, makes for a powerful and differentiated investment platform.

TIIC Group operates from two offices in Lisbon and Paris, providing its team with access to relevant
investment opportunities across key target markets in Europe as well as to leading industrial contractors,
operators, advisors and financiers in the infrastructure industry.

TIIC Group successfully raised a First Fund with €140m of commitments targeting transportation
investments across Europe. The portfolio of the First Fund comprises 6 assets located in Portugal, Spain,
France and Poland. They represent a carefully balanced mix of greenfield and early stage brownfield projects
in roads and car parks. TIIC Group has played an active role in the sourcing and development of all
investments and has made a significant contribution to value creation. TIIC Group believes that this is a high
quality, operationally secure, cash yielding portfolio of assets which will be of strong interest to potential
investors over the coming few years.

TIIC has launched a successor fund, TIIC 2, which will build upon TIIC Group’ differentiated approach to
infrastructure in Europe. TIIC 2 will is targeting aggregate commitments from investors of €300m (€350m
hard cap) to invest into both transportation and social infrastructure projects in Europe. TIIC 2 will also seek
to invest, ona very selective basis, into greenfield social infrastructure projects in New Frontier Markets,
within close proximity to the European Union. Given its powerful network of relationships across Europe and
the operational skills of its team, TIIC Group will continue to target superior investment returns for TIIC 2’s

we’re quite serious about the use of
force,” he said. “In the first term, the
administration didn’t always speak with
one voice on this issue. So what Hagel
says can make a difference.”

Despite his poorly receieved performance

at his confirmation hearings, it’s widely
believed in Washington that Hagel will

be confirmed as secretary of defense and
that his private advice to Obama will
more closely hew to his long-held beliefs
about the futility of sanctions and the
grave downside to a military strike. Partly
for that reason, it remains very unlikely
that the Obama administration will resort
to force to resolve the dispute with Iran.
In fact, in remarks that Iranian officials
cited as promising, Vice President Joe
Biden expressed the administration’s
willingness to hold bilateral talks with the
Iranians. In response to a question at the
Munich Security Conference Biden said,
“We have made it clear at the outset
that...we would be prepared to meet
bilaterally with the Iranian leadership”
when Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei is serious about
negotiations. [ran’s Foreign Minister, Ali
Akbar Salehi responded favorably and
said, “I am optimistic, I feel this new

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012767.txt,"new line of mice with a special accessory: an upgraded memory and learning system. When these new
and improved mice ran through an IQ test, they outperformed normal mice.

Tsien pulled off an extraordinary engineering trick, creating a lineage of smarter mice. This is
cowboy science, showing the power of genetic tampering to open the door to evolutionary changes. In a
world of competition, one would imagine that selection should favor these smart mice who have better
recall of essential foraging routes, previous social interactions, and places to rest out of harm’s way from
predators. But in biology, there are always trade-offs. Benefits in one area of life are often accompanied
by costs in others.

Several months after Tsien’s report, a follow-up study of the same memory-enhanced mice
appeared in print, also in a distinguished scientific journal. But this time there was no media fanfare. The
new work was carried out by Min Zhuo at Washington University, an ex-member of Tsien’s lab and a co-
author of the original paper. Zhuo’s new paper confirmed that memory-enhanced mice were indeed
smarter, but also showed that they were more sensitive to pain, licking their wounds more and for longer
periods of time than normal mice. Though it is unclear whether Zhuo’s results reveal heightened pain
sensitivity, stronger memories for pain, or some combination of these and other processes, what is clear is
that the engineering that led to smarter mice led to much more.

Tsien and Zhuo’s work shows that even with targeted, artificial changes in the underlying
biology, unanticipated consequences are common. It also shows that deep within the biology of every
organism lies hidden capacities and potential for change. Unleashing these sub rosa capacities can have
both beneficial and costly consequences for the individual and group.

The idea I develop in this chapter is that our capacity for evil evolved as an incidental, but natural
consequence of our uniquely engineered brain. Unlike any other species, our brain promiscuously
combines and recombines thoughts and emotions to create a virtually limitless range of solutions to an
ever-changing environment. This new form of intelligence enabled us to solve many problems, but two
are of particular interest given their adaptive consequences: killing competitors and punishing cheaters in
a diversity of contexts. But like the painful fall-out from artificially engineering a smarter mouse, so too
was there fall-out from the natura/ engineering of a smarter human: a species that experiences pleasure
from harming others. This is part of the recipe for evil.

This chapter sets out the evidence to support the idea that evil evolved as an incidental
consequence of our brain’s design. I begin by discussing the two general processes that landed us in the
unforeseen and uninhabited niche of evildoers: the evolution of byproducts and promiscuous connections
within the human brain. Because these are general processes, we will take a short reprieve from matters

specifically evil.

Saudi plans to keep capacity flat add to medium term tightness

Saudi Arabia has 12.5mn bpd of crude production capacity, according to the
government, and the country suggested within the NTP that it plans to maintain
capacity at the current level to 2020. Saudi Arabia is the only material holder of spare
crude oil production capacity around the world. Spare capacity currently sits at c2mn
bpd, which is one of the lowest levels ever. Even if Saudi Arabia did start investing
today, it would take a number of years to be completed and would unlikely be ready
before 2020 in any case. Hence, as Saudi ramps up production over the medium-term by
digging into its spare capacity, the risk premium in the oil market will rise as the market
becomes increasingly less able to handle future supply disruptions.

If Saudi gas production gets off the ground, it could crowd out oil demand...

The Saudi NTP plans to grow domestic gas production by 50% to 18 bcf/d by 2020, and
to use most of this gas to meet a 30% rise in domestic power demand and moreover
boost gas’ share in power generation to 70%, up from 50% currently. This implies that
oil burned for power generation could drop by 30% or 300 thousand bpd by 2020, most
of which would likely be crude which is more valuable in the export market than the

blockchain, big data, and robo advisory can change the game. Strong panel attendance
suggested high interest in these themes, and polling feedback suggests shareholders

What exactly can the administration do to hasten technological innovation besides hosting datapaloozas? The fact sheet
points to two proposals: one that requires money, and one that doesn't. A “First in the World” fund of $260 million,
presumably requiring congressional approval, would “test and evaluate innovative approaches to higher education that
yield dramatically better outcomes.” Education officials liken this to a $650 million “Investing in Innovation” fund created
under the 2009 stimulus law that has been used as seed money for experiments in K-12 education.

And the Education Department could cut regulatory barriers to innovation, whatever those might be. Education officials said
Friday that they plan to solicit ideas from colleges on what government rules are hindering innovation. Many educators
might say that red tape gets in the way of experiments in distance learning and degree programs not organized around the
traditional credit hour.

The fact sheet asserts: “The Department will use its authority to issue regulatory waivers for ‘experimental sites’ that
promote high-quality, low-cost innovations in higher education, such as making it possible for students to get financial aid
based on how much they learn, rather than the amount of time they spend in class.”

Massively Online And Offline Too: How MOOCs Will Evolve In The Physical World
Giovanni Rodriguez — Forbes

| was at the airport about this time last Sunday, when | overheard a conversation that’s becoming quite commonplace. One
person was explaining to another what a MOOC was, but he couldn’t remember what the letters stood for. As someone who
regards himself as an amateur, ad-hoc, in-the-moment teacher, | felt compelled to help him out: “Massive. Open. Online.
Course.” He thanked me. He had been struggling to remember the “open” part of the MOOC message. And, even more
interesting, he had been struggling to remember the word “course.”

Over the past few months, more and more clients and partners have been coming to me to deconstruct not just the acronym
but also the attributes of MOOCs. So often in fact that | have decided to write a short series on the subject. There are many
things to say about both the true impact and hype about MOOCs in the larger narrative that’s emerging about disruption in
education. But from where I sit, what’s most important to note about MOOCs in 2013 is something that the acronym does
not yet capture: the massive disruption we’re seeing in education will be online and offline, too.

Experience

There are at least three reasons for this. And each of these reasons deserves at least one post, but I'll be super brief here.
The first is that the online experience of MOOCs will almost certainly evolve in a way that teachers, students, and staff will
look to find ways to meet with one another. This will either happen by design (by intent and with care) or it will happen
organically. Almost certainly, the producers of MOOCs will look to do this with some sense of design, while leveraging the
organic power of networks to grow by themselves. And if you have been following the evolution of MOOCs, you already
know that the online experience is still a work in progress. My business colleague, Chris Bennett — a behavior designer and
gamification expert — and | recently spoke about this: many are stuck in the old paradigm of delivering education to the
consumer, rather than leveraging the greatest assets of the new medium (co-creation, crowdsourcing, collaboration). By
redesigning the online experience to become more interactive, innovators in the MOOC world will see the possibilities for
offline experience.

Inventory

Another reason for thinking about physical space: while the world ponders the impact that the costs of higher education will
have on schools that are struggling to compete, the inventory of quality physical space that becomes available will appeal to
organizations that need it. A couple of years ago, | had the privilege of serving as an advisor to a White House initiative that
traveled the country meeting with leaders in large spaces in a network of state and community colleges. As a former
theater producer, | was impressed with the availability and quality of these spaces. In theater — and other kinds of shared,
quasi-spiritual, transformative experience — physical space is everything. Innovators in the MOOC world will get wise — if
they haven't already — to the existence of networks of spaces (there are many different networks, as | will show in a later

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021313.txt,"psychology to (at least momentary)
consideration of a career in government
service. A student with the long-held
intent of becoming a researcher and with
no interest in politics, government, or
public service might seem to be an
immovable object. And yet, in that
moment, Jordan’s speech had sufficient
impact to make government service
seem like the only path one would want
to take or should ever consider.

Although her points were argued
well, the impact of Jordan’s speech was
not simply rhetorical. John F.
Kennedy’s “Ask not what your country
can do for you....” and Martin Luther
King, Jr.’s “I have a dream....” affected
listeners deeply well beyond the
cognitive strengths of a good argument.
Moreover, while all these speeches were
delivered beautifully and from the heart,
it is not the performance of these
speeches alone that can move listeners to
act on behalf of others. The
performance alone cannot give substance
to an empty message. While there are
cases in which a great performance may
suggest briefly that there was content of
import even in the absence of a real
message, it is more likely the
conjunction of message and delivery that
moves people. In these speeches is a
clear demonstration of the power of
language. Language is more than words
and more than delivery. Indeed, Cicero,
in De Oratore, said that rhetoric conveys
information, persuades listeners, and
evokes emotion.

“In the beginning was the word....”

If “the word made flesh” is taken
metaphorically, the power of language
can be made visceral in sermons.
Consider the power of Jonathan
Edwards’ sermon, which Clark Gilpin’s
chapter discusses, to terrify a

Page | 67

congregation, to wrench them from
complacency with images of torment. A
sermon delivers a message, but it can do
so in calm tones of instruction or with
fire and brimstone. The choice and
poetry of words and the cadence and
intonation of speaking can draw the
listener in slowly or seize the listener
suddenly, the very sounds of speech
painting images in the mind while
igniting new inferences with literal and
metaphoric descriptions.

In the realm of the spiritual, there
are few corporeal manifestations that can
be perceived directly. Neither heaven
nor hell, neither God nor the Devil can
be seen or heard or touched. Preaching
is needed to spell out the work of unseen
hands and will and illuminate the power
of the unseen. The force of that which is
not seen can only be felt when
transmitted directly through speech.

In Phaedrus, Plato described
rhetoric as the art of leading the soul.
Thus it is not surprising that, while at the
core of religion is a collection of beliefs
and concepts and canons, the fabric and
form of religion is language. Symbols
and icons are certainly important, but
language is the medium through which
the force of theology is actualized in
prayers, benedictions, sermons, and
teaching. Language can reach across
time and space to change minds,
feelings, and behavior, encoding laws
and beliefs and presenting them with a
concrete reality in the here and now.
This is one kind of impact from author to
audience in which a kind of connection
is constructed bridging minds.

At the same time, in religious
practices, another kind of connection is
formed within a congregation. Joint
recitation, responsive reading, collective
listening, and understanding may serve

Long HSCEI-SPX volatility spread via corridor variance

Global synchronized monetary tightening is positive for EM vol

Emerging markets have been the biggest beneficiaries of the central bank-fueled
abundance of liquidity. However, we think the tide may be turning as last week, the Fed,
ECB, and BOE all delivered policy announcements with hawkish tones. How far they
really go to tighten policy when economic data is weakening still remains unknown.
However, we think the uncertainty surrounding tightening will be more positive for EM
volatility than for DM volatility.

Chinese banks: Rapid increase in leverage is a big concern

The HSCEI currently has a 70% weight in the financial sector. Recently, BofAML analyst
Winnie Wu turned very bearish on the sector as (1) leverage has rapidly increased—debt
to GDP rose by 18% in 2016 and may go above 300% by 2019, (2) shadow banking has
become too big, too complicated, and too levered to easily regulate—even at the
highest quality bank, China Merchants, off-balance sheet wealth management products
(WMP) have grown to 40% the size of on-balance sheet assets from just 18% two years
ago, and (3) excessive home price inflation—low and middle-income households are late
to the party and a correction in prices could have a systemic effect as property assets
have been used as collateral in WMPs.

SPX: The Fed is now “collaring” the market

Since the global financial crisis the Fed has been well known for providing a put option
by its willingness to step in during periods of market stress. However, post the Fed
meeting last week, it appears the central bank has decided to cap its monetary support
as some FOMC members seem worried that financial conditions are too loose.
Effectively, the market is now “collared” (more so for the SPX compared to EM) as the
downside is protected by the Fed put (though with a lower strike price) while the upside
is capped by log-jammed fiscal policy and positioning, where the risk of quant funds
selling record equity positions meets cashed-up investors still accustomed to buying-
the-dip.

The depressed implied China vs. US risks should reverse

With the steep drop in global risk premium, the HSCEI-SPX 18-month variance swap
spread has fallen back to the lower-end of its 5-year trading range. Since we believe the
global synchronized monetary tightening will impact HSCE! volatility more than SPX
volatility, we recommend owning HSCEI-SPX 70/110% corridor variance at 5 vol points,
a 3 vol point discount to vanilla variance spreads. Investors will be exposed to the
realized vol spread between HSCEI and SPX as long as HSCEI stays within 70-110% of
its initial level. Pricing of corridor variance is cheaper than vanilla variance as investors
can avoid paying for the rich HSCEI convexity below the 70% barrier. The trade has a
positive carry and benefits during China risk-off events.

Note that the potential HSCEI index enhancement will reduce the financial weightings in
HSCEI from 70% to 50% and lower realized volatility by 1.8 vol points. However, the
enhancement will be implemented in stages. It will probably start in Dec-17 at the
earliest and will not be fully implemented by the end of 2018, in our view.

known, with his eyes shut, that he was in that ancient capital and imperial city,
Vienna.” To really get a feel for that age, watch just a few frames of Russian director
Dizga Vertov’s jittery 1929 black and white film Man with a Movie Camera’, Each
moment of the movie is alive with the tension of a new, rushing and industrial age.
You won't be surprised Vertov’s list of requirements as he prepared to start filming
began: “1. A rapid means of transportation.” His aim was to immortalize urban
speed on the new medium film; he knew he needed to be fast.184

To know a city by it’s pace. Musil was touching something deep here, an instinct that
beats in each of us and runs from this fact: The speed of an event affects how we
perceive it. The difference between what you will notice when walking up a hill -
chirping bugs, tiny rocks, changes in color and gradient - and driving up that hill is
so complete as to be almost different experiences entirely.!®° When the whole world
tumbles upon us at fiber-optic speed, when invasions and revelations and accidents
all spread at the rate of WiFi or cell phone radiation, our sense of time blurs. You
have to wonder what Simmel would have made of a smart phone. “It is not merely
that the medium is the message, but the velocity of the medium,” Paul Virlio
observed once in one of his many studies on speed and mind.186

Life in our connected age is both instant and always on, what Simmel might have
called “the technique of network life.” This demolishes an older, easier sense of pace.
Computers were once switched on at 9 and off at 5 — just like their human masters.
But digital activity is constant now. The networks are paying attention all the time.
They have to. Our machines - tractors and trains and cars - used to echo our pace of
life. Now we echo theirs. The machines, the New Caste, the black boxes - they tick
along constantly, ever faster. We rely on them, as we've seen, for our safety. We
want them to be fast. To be instant. But what is this doing to us? Is completely
unhooking us from any sense of time really a good idea?

It was certainly true, as Brand insisted, that the Clock of the Long Now was meant as
a reminder, as a kind of constant totem to the fact that we’re all just a small tick on

Then, during his confirmation hearings
on January 31, Hagel — under hostile

positions on Iran, including the role of
sanctions. And, though he previously
been a sharp critic of a military attack on
Iran, in his opening statement Hagel said:
“T am fully committed to the President’s
goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a

hawk who served as Obama’s top adviser
on Iran during much of the president’s

which is forecast to deliver a gross IRR of up to 14% and a multiple of approximately 2x on invested capital.

TIIC announced the first close of TIIC 2 on December 30 2016, with aggregate commitments of €135m from
a group of high quality and well-diversified limited partners. First close investors in TIIC 2 include the
European Investment Bank and Edmond de Rothschild, both with significant commitments, as well as the
TIIC team. TIIC 2 is also supported by a number of existing investors, together with several European
insurance companies, pension funds and family offices. A second close is planned in the coming months and
the final close will occur before the end of 2017. We have received significant interest from a number of
European institutional investors, many of which are in the process of completing detailed due diligence on
TIIC 2. We are firmly on track to achieve a final close of TIIC 2 before the end of the year.

Furthermore, TIIC has announced the first exit from Fund 1, with outstanding returns. Three other
investments are in sales processes and should close during the next few months.

BRIDGE

BRIDGE is an infrastructure debt platform initiated by Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management (EdRAM) to
enable institutional investors to access infrastructure assets with secured and stable revenue streams. BRIDGE
is a London based second generation debt fund sourcing and structuring transactions directly from sponsors
when feasible and one of the few independent debt teams only investing on behalf of clients. The BRIDGE
team has the ability to execute and deliver transactions as efficiently as traditional lenders as well as negotiate
terms and conditions bringing optimised yield and security to investors.

The BRIDGE platform was set up as a new leg of EDR’s Infrastructure, Real Assets & Structured Finance Team
striving to take advantage of the expertise of the infrastructure sector acquired when the team became a
global leader in PPP & Transport infrastructure financial advisory in 2011 and 2012.

The BRIDGE platform raised € 400m of new monies in 2016 and has successfully reached the €1bn mark of
Assets under Management at the end of 2016. The platform comprises three investment vehicles (French FCT
and Lux SIF) and is currently fundraising for additional pockets of liquidity:

o BRIDGE | reached final closing in December 2014 with approximately €600m of aggregate commitments from a club
of institutional investors.

o BRIDGE | Dedicated Compartmentis a vehicle created by a large European institution and anchor investor of the first
fund with a €250m target amount available for deployment.

o BRIDGE Il reached first close in December 2016 with €150m of commitments in order to invest in three transactions.
Fundraising for BRIDGE Il is still ongoing, targeting a group of institutional investors in Europe and elsewhere, with final
target size of €600m.

Removal of the 3pp p.a. drag from Resources supports EPS outlook. Second, the

Resources sectors in 2017 will likely provide a (strongly) positive contribution to market
EPS, in turn reversing what has been the biggest headwind for several years. Over the
last 3-5 years the Resources sectors provided a 2.5 percentage point drag on annualized
market EPS growth. In 2016 Banks have been the other big drag on market earnings.
While structural headwinds to profitability mean the contribution of Banks remains open
to debate, consensus forecasts nevertheless imply a strong recovery in 2017 (driven in
part by one-offs reversing). The important point is that the market ex-Banks and

Resources has delivered modest but positive EPS growth — estimated at +5.5% for
2016. Hence, removing the drag from Oil and Mining makes high single digit growth

achievable in our view.

Margin upside, capex discipline and FX tailwind provide additional support. Third,
profit margins in Europe are not elevated: in the bottom third of the historical range
(since 2004) at the EBITDA level and about average at the net level. With some
acceleration in the top-line as global growth and inflation pick up, there is scope for
margins to improve. In addition, several years of relative capex discipline provide
potential support for margin improvement over the next 1-2 years in corporate Europe.
Over the longer term, we find that operating margins have tended to improve with a lag
of one to two years, following a period of declining capex ratios. That is encouraging for

years after the acquisition. After another employee of Company A reports the long-running bribe scheme to a director at
Foreign Government Agency, Company A stops the payments and DOJ and SEC investigate.

Based on these facts, would DOJ or SEC charge Company A?

Yes. DOJ and SEC have prosecuted companies like Company A in similar circumstances. Any charges would not,
however, be premised upon successor liability, but rather on Company A's post-acquisition bribe payments, which
themselves created criminal and civil liability for Company A.

Scenario 3:

Under local law, Company A's ability to conduct pre-acquisition due diligence on Foreign Company is limited. In the
due diligence it does conduct, Company A determines that Foreign Company is doing business in high-risk countries
and in high-risk industries but finds no red flags specific to Foreign Company's operations. Post-acquisition, Company
A conducts extensive due diligence and determines that Foreign Company had paid bribes to officials with Foreign
Government Agency. Company A takes prompt action to remediate the problem, including following the measures set
forth in Opinion Procedure Release No. 08-02. Among other actions, it voluntarily discloses the misconduct to DOJ and
SEC, ensures all bribes are immediately stopped, takes remedial action against all parties involved in the corruption, and
quickly incorporates Foreign Company into a robust compliance program and Company A's other internal controls.

Based on these facts, would DOJ or SEC prosecute Company A?

DOJ and SEC have declined to prosecute companies like Company A in similar circumstances. Companies can follow
the measures set forth in Opinion Procedure Release No. 08-02, or seek their own opinions, where adequate pre-acquisition
due diligence is not possible.

Hypothetical: Successor Liability Where Acquired Company Was Already Subject to
the FCPA

Both Company A and Company B are Delaware corporations with their principal offices in the United States. Both
companies’ shares are listed on a national U.S. exchange.

Scenario 1:

Company Ais considering acquiring several of Company B’s business lines. Prior to the acquisition, Company A engages
in extensive due diligence, including: (1) having its legal, accounting, and compliance departments review Company B’s
sales and financial data, its customer contracts, and its third-party and distributor agreements; (2) performing a risk-based
analysis of Company B’s customer base; (3) performing an audit of selected transactions engaged in by Company B; and
(4) engaging in discussions with Company B’s general counsel, vice president of sales, and head of internal audit regarding
all corruption risks, compliance efforts, and any other major corruption-related issues that have surfaced at Company B
over the past ten years. This due diligence aims to determine whether Company B has appropriate anti-corruption and
compliance policies in place, whether Company B’s employees have been adequately trained regarding those policies,
how Company B ensures that those policies are followed, and what remedial actions are taken if the policies are violated.

During the course of its due diligence, Company A learns that Company B has made several potentially improper
payments in connection with a government contract with Foreign Country. As a condition of the acquisition, Company A
requires Company B to disclose the misconduct to the government. Company A makes certain that the illegal payments

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018404.txt,"Gatekeeping, as we've seen, isn’t simply the act of marking geographic lines. Those
hurrying walls and berms and triple-fences of the real world are a kind of
gatekeeping but they are also, I’m pretty sure, expressions of a deeper desire. Each
is areal-world defense against topological pressures of population and ideology and
violence, all shaped by network magnetism. The likely futility of such gates is clear
enough when you contemplate the forces they are intended to keep out: Refugees
see prosperity miles on their phones. Little wonder they rush at it. Internet-
transmitted messages light up ideologies, protests or fundamentalisms that pull
people back and forth endlessly across physical borders. The world responds, as
anyone without a Seventh Sense might, with walls. But to focus merely on the
physical? This is to misread the issue. Gatekeeping includes real-world borders, of
course, but the statesmen of the future will act particularly on topologies. They will
work not merely to stop up flows, but to decide their movement. Gates will, for
instance, serve as bespoke disease buffers, created to track and then freeze the
wotrisome pandemics now crawling at us on the connections of our age. Other gates
will be economic tools: The will help isolate and then soothe the unstable and
apparently broken, middle-class eroding financial patterns of the past decades.

Recall how the design of computer or network systems affects the real world, like a
marble slipped under a carpet? Gatekeeping’s topological design is like placing
marbles (or boulders) in particular ways, to direct movements and flows as you
might guide water with a canal. The great historian Arnold Toynbee once recalled a
passing moment with British Prime Minister Lloyd George during the endless (and
disastrous) Paris Peace Conference of 1919. “Lloyd George, to my delight, had
forgotten my presence,” Toynbee wrote, “and began to think aloud.
‘Mesopotamia...yes...oil...irrigation...we must have Mesopotamia; Palestine...yes...
the Holy Land... Zionism... we must have Palestine...; Syria... h’m... what is there in
Syria? Let the French have that.”246 This sort of charmless arrogance -— The Holy
Land....We must have that - doesn’t much suit our age, but that comprehensive view?
What oil and irrigation and Suez were to Lloyd George, emergence and data flows
and gates are to us. There’s a crucial difference, however: We need not take the most
precious territory of our age through invasion or colonial exploitation or in mis-
balanced peace settlements. We can build the essential landscape of power. We can
build it for defense. And then we can grow it, perfect it, and attract others. Schmitt
was right, human history is the story of enclosures - and nothing about our
emerging age suggests any other approach can, with a single clear line, solve the
vexing network x network x weapons problems we face. Hard Gatekeeping means
molding the landscape, gate by gate, to encourage certain movements and make
others difficult, costly, maybe even impossible. Any future order must begin with
this first principle: The line between in and out is as essential as what goes on
inside.

number even without any showing of need. Nothing in the rule, however, would bar the defendant from requesting that
information by filing an appropriate motion. The court could then determine whether any such motion had merit. !7°

[*874]
Rule 15 - Victims’ Right To Attend Pre-Trial Depositions
The Proposal:

Rule 15 should allow victims to attend any public deposition in a case as follows:

(i) Victims Can Attend. A Victim can attend any public deposition taken under this rule under the same conditions as govern a
victim's attendance at trial.

The Rationale:

Victims have the right not to be excluded from any ... public court proceeding, except in rare cases where their testimony

178 and

will be materially affected. '’7 Depositions authorized by Rule 15 are for the purpose of preserving evidence for trial,
thus are effectively an extension of the trial. Victims accordingly have the right to attend such proceedings, if public, under the
same conditions governing their attendance at trial. To avoid any confusion over this issue, the proposed rule change directly

states that conclusion.

Because victims can be excluded from the trial in certain rare situations where their testimony would be materially affected,
'79 they can likewise be excluded from a deposition in those situations. The proposed rule simply applies the limitations on
attending trial to the deposition setting by providing that the same conditions apply to the victim's attendance at the

deposition.

[*875]

Rule 17 - Victims’ Right to Notice of Subpoena of Confidential Information
The Proposal:

Rule 17 regarding subpoenas should be modified to give victims notice before personal or confidential mformation is
subpoenaed and to allow victims to file a motion to quash such a subpoena as follows:

(h)(2) Victim Information. After indictment, no record or document containing personal or confidential information about a
victim may be subpoenaed without a finding by the court that the information is relevant to trial and that compliance appears to
be reasonable. If the court makes such a finding, notice shall then be given to the victim, through the attorney for the
government or for the victim, before the subpoena is served. On motion made promptly by the victim, the court may quash or
modify the subpoena if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive.

The Rationale:

The existing rules governing subpoenas are flawed because they allow the parties to subpoena personal or confidential
information about a victim from third parties without the victim's knowledge. This issue arose recently in the Utah state

76 Cf. United States v. Wills, 88 F.3d 704, 709-10 (9th Cir. 1996) (allowing delayed disclosure of alibi witness because witness feared for
safety and defendant had violent history and allowing ex parte hearing because of need to keep identity of witness from the defendant).

Key questions

e When will the economy bottom out?

e What economic policy responses can we expect to support the economy ahead?

e How significant is the contagion risk from a possible downturn in the Eurozone?

ClO View (Probability: 70%*) Modest policy easing to support growth in 2H12
e The latest economic data suggest that economic activity is showing signs of stabilization, albeit at a
comparatively low level. However, we have yet to see meaningful pick-up in activity. We think that policy
measures to support the economy should have more visible effect on activity in the second half of the
year.

¢ To this effect, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) has recently cut interest rates by 25bps — the first such
move since late 2008. With investment demand still sluggish, we don't expect the measure to have a
significant near-term effect on growth. Still, the cut confirms the leadership's commitment to support the
economy. Importantly, with the rate cut, measures were announced to increase the banks’ ability to set
interest rates, which should bolster private household spending power in the future.

e The rate reduction took place against a backdrop of falling price inflation. Thus, inflation is no obstacle
for further measures to ease monetary policy. However, at this point we don't expect further rate cuts this
year; especially since increased interest rate flexibility should contribute to an easing of monetary
conditions ahead. If anything, we think the PBoC may implement more reductions in banks' reserve
requirement rates to ensure sufficient liquidity provisions. Thus, we think the real focus has to be on the
fiscal policy measures now, including possibly an acceleration of infrastructure investments, measures to
support consumer spending and selective relaxation in the property market (while keeping home-purchase
restrictions intact).

A Positive scenario (Probability: 20%*) Higher-than-expected growth

¢ Chinese GDP grows above 8.5% in 2012. For this we would probably need to see stronger-than-expected
fiscal and monetary policy support from the government. A speedy improvement in the Eurozone debt
crisis could also lead to this positive scenario.

& Negative scenario (Probability: 10%*) Hard landing
¢ Chinese GDP growth below 6%, i.e. a hard landing of the economy. This could be triggered by a global
financial crisis/recession, causing a slump in Chinese exports. Other risks include a sharp decline in Chinese
residential property prices — which would slow investment growth, a large-scale default of local
government debt, or a surge in inflation that forces the PBoC to significantly tighten monetary policy.

I' m talking here about seriously dumb decisions, not those minor
regrets like that time in 1970 when £squire magazine assigned me to fly to
New Mexico where director Monte Hellman was filming 7wo-Lane
Blacktop, about street-racing. Among the actors was a pair of musicians,
James Taylor as a driver, and Dennis Wilson as a mechanic. They both
agreed to be interviewed, besides screenwriter Rudy Wurlitzer and others.

During a conversation with Taylor about not laughing at jokes, he

year-old actress, Laurie Bird, who played “The Girl,” had sex with two
members of the crew. Nine years later she would commit suicide.

group you might hope to take aside, pull into a quiet room and ask gently What are
the really networks for, anyway? this would be it.

The act of keeping time, of marking it, is embedded in the nature of any age. Our
lives are, after all, dictated by timetables: School schedules, the seasons, rush hour,
the burning candle of birth-love-marriage-death. Time, in the days before industry,
was measured by nature’s schedule. How long it took a crop to mature. The
solstices. A beehive filling with honey. It was marked by moving tides and shifting
seasons, and it demanded a slowness, a personal presence on the shores, in the
oceans, atop the fields over generations. “Summer afternoon,” the novelist Henry
James remarked in a précis of a slower age he felt passing away in 1895. “To me
those have always been the two most beautiful words in the English language.” 18°

Then, in the industrial revolution, time became money. Electric lights, for instance,
undid the restful distinction between night and day - and made 24-hour life and
manufacturing and economics possible and then, of course, inevitable. Movement
from countryside to city established a really new sense of what the German critic
Georg Simmel, writing in 1903, called tempo. “With each crossing of the street, with
the tempo and multiplicity of economic, occupational and social life, the city sets up
a deep contrast with small town and rural life,” he explained. “The technique of
metropolitan life is unimaginable without the most punctual integration of all
activities and mutual relations into a stable and impersonal time schedule.”18! Punch
cards. Bus schedules. The forty hour work week. Our education, our manufacturing,
our markets and our lives all began to run on timetables. They had to, or the whole
project of industry would collapse. “Summer Afternoon” became a time to work.
Simmel worried, for instance, over the diffusion of pocket watches. To carry one was
like looking at a constantly draining bank account.

This sense of humans reduced to cogs - churned, run, disposed of on a schedule not
their own - unnerved the residents of that first mechanical age. Cities had been the
very first sorts of tight-packed networks; industrial cities ratcheted this further still.
They succeeded and failed by the degree to which they geared themselves and their
citizens to machine speed. When the Austrian novelist Robert Musil began The Man
Without Qualities, his classic story of the era, with the flattening of a Viennese citizen
by a speeding delivery truck, he meant to point out how urban speed and urban life
(and urban death) had become inseparable. And also the mismatch between the
weak breaks of the age and it’s acceleration. The book is alive with that pre-accident
slipping sensation you may have had: You are pressing hard on the brakes of the car;
you are going to hit something anyhow. “Cities can be recognized by their pace just
as people can by their walk,” Musil wrote in a line that any modern New Yorker or

Chapter 7’

Action at a Distance: The Invisible
Force of Language

7 The lead author is Howard Nusbaum, Ph.D.,
Professor of Psychology and Computational
Neuroscience, and co-director of the Center for
Cognitive and Social Neuroscience at the
University of Chicago. He has served as the
Chair of the Psychology Department since 1997.
He has served as the editor for the International
Journal of Speech Technology and 1s on the
editorial board of Brain & Language, and has
edited several books on spoken language
processing. His research interests include
spoken language use, mechanisms of learning
and attention, and the role of sleep in learning.
His recent research has investigated the social
use of language and the evolution of language.
In addition, he has been working on neural
mechanisms of reward and economic decisions.

We often think about language in terms
of the information in newspapers or speeches or
reports. However, language 1s basis of all our
social relationships and institutions. We reward
and praise with language and we shun and
punish with language, perhaps more often than
with any other medium. In the recent election,
Democratic candidates actually gave speeches
outlining different views of the importance of
language in our society. One candidate held that
words are simply words and only have the force
that we give to them by reasoning about them.
The other candidate argued that speech has the
power to move people to connect and act.
Nusbaum was struck by this debate because it
seems to him that the power of language goes
well beyond what linguists and psychologists
talk about as “meaning” and that understanding
the meaning of language may depend on
understanding the social and emotional impact of
language. In this chapter, the idea of the impact
of language at a distance is explored.

Page | 66

Language is one of the most
important ways in which the social brain
makes connections, enhances
connections, and severs connections
among people. Language is our primary
medium of social exchange, grounding
and elaborating our selves and our
relationships in every conversation.
However, language goes well beyond
personal connections to connect us
culturally through stories, songs, and
shared manners of speech. Language
also provides the formal framework that
defines many of our social institutions.
Language gives form and substance to
the governance and behavior of every
social institution from education to law
to religion. Clearly there are many ways
in which language serves to knit us
together both formally and informally.
For a linguist, all of these uses can be
analyzed in terms of the structure of
sentences and their content. However,
structure and content do not, on their
own merits, provide a complete picture
of how language can have the impact it
does on our sense of social connection.
How does language move us to act,
change our feelings, and connect us to
others? It seems unlikely that the impact
of language is simply the result of
dispassionate rational inferences and
conclusions drawn from a logical
analysis of sentences.

In 1976, Barbara Jordan, a
Congresswoman from Texas, gave the
commencement address at Brandeis
University. Listening to her speak about
the importance of public service and the
importance of using talent and ability in
service of one’s country was an
impressive experience. Her delivery was
clear and not particularly dramatic and
yet the force of her speech was riveting.
It was sufficient to turn a graduating
senior’s mind from graduate school in

Martin G. Weinberg, an attorney for Epstein, said in a statement that
Epstein’s plea was “fairly negotiated by experienced teams of
attorneys representing each party.”

“It was anything but a sweetheart deal,” Weinberg said. “And it was
carefully and fully reviewed not only by senior prosecutors within the
Southern District of Florida Office but also at multiple levels of the
Department of Justice in D.C.”

The government, he said, “avoided litigation risks including the risks of
an acquittal and Mr. Epstein went to jail, served a period of probation,
lived up to each and every obligation under the Agreement, and has
fully conformed his conduct to the law for well over 10 years.”

Indian Police Arrest Suspects in Two Gang Rapes
Sean Mclain and Khushita Vasan — Wall Street Journal

Indian police Sunday were holding 10 men suspected of involvement in two highly publicized gang-rape cases—one in
urban Mumbai, the other in rural Jnarkhand state—highlighting India's struggles with sexual violence.

In Jharkhand in eastern India, police said they had detained five suspects in connection with the rape of a policewoman by a
group of men who had set up a roadblock on a highway. The attack occurred Thursday, but wasn't reported to police until
Friday, they said.

Five other men were in custody Sunday in the Mumbai case, in which a 22-year-old magazine intern taking photographs of
dilapidated buildings was assaulted Thursday in an abandoned textile mill in the city, police said.

The attacks come as the trial of five people accused in the December gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student ona
Delhi bus entered its final phase. That crime sparked nationwide demonstrations and prompted the government to
introduce harsher penalties for crimes against women.

Protesters took to the streets of Mumbai on Friday to decry the assault on the magazine intern in a city that has a reputation
as arelatively safe place for women. In 2012, the incidence of rape in the Western Indian metropolis was about half the

national rate, according to the National Crime Records Bureau.

I've always felt much safer in Mumbai compared to other Indian cities, said Sanika Prabhu, a television producer from
Mumbai. After this incident, | feel like | don't recognize this city anymore.

Mumbai police said the magazine intern was with a 21-year-old male companion when she was attacked Thursday. The
assailants tied his hands with his belt and raped the woman from 5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m., an official at N.M. Joshi police station
said. Medical tests confirmed the rape, he said.

Under Indian law, rape victims cannot be named in media accounts.

There were 24,915 reported rapes in India in 2012, according to the National Crime Records Bureau, including 233 in
Mumbai. The victims in almost half the Mumbai cases were between 14 and 18 years old.

Activists say the number of rapes is much higher, as many go unreported. India also has a poor record on convictions, with
only around a quarter of alleged rapists convicted in 2010.

In Jharkhand, police said the rape of the police constable occurred at around 1:30 a.m. on Thursday, as she and her

helped boost bank stocks by 12%, bank management teams were generally optimistic
with regards to the economic outlook heading into 2017. Greater fiscal stimulus that is

improve the overall sentiment in the sector. When asked what the biggest impact of the

Nature’s secrets

Nature hides her secrets because of her essential loftiness, but not by means of ruse.
— Albert Einstein

In Charles Darwin’s day, biologists unearthed the mysteries of evolution by means of observation,
sometimes accompanied by a simple experiment. This was largely a process of documenting the patterns
of variation and uniformity that nature left behind. Only breeders were directly involved in manipulating
these patterns, using artificial selection to alter the size, shape, coloration, and lifespan of plants and
animals.

The Darwins of today continue this tradition, but with new tools, informed by understanding of
the genetic code and aided by technical developments in engineering, physics, chemistry, and computer
science. These tools allow for deeper penetration into the sources of change, and the causes of
evolutionary similarities and differences. They also enable biologists to change the course of evolution
and the patterns of development by turning genes off or turning novel ones on, and even creating
synthetic organisms in test tubes — a wonderful playground for understanding both questions of origin,
change, and extinction.

The Darwins of today are cowboys, trailblazing a new frontier of understanding. But like the
frontier of the early American wild west, nature holds many secrets and surprises. Sometimes when we
break through nature’s guard, we gain fundamental truths about the living world, knowledge that can be
harnessed to improve animal and human welfare. But sometimes when we break through, we create toxic
consequences and ethical dilemmas. Tampering with nature is risky business as there are many hidden
and unforeseen consequences.

In 1999, the molecular biologist Joe Tsien and his team at Princeton University tampered with
mother nature. Their discovery, published in a distinguished scientific journal, soon filled the
newspapers, radio airwaves, and even a spot on Dave Letterman’s late night television show. Tsien

manipulated a gene that was known to influence memory, causing it to work over time. This created a

The new Wasit project, which is due to come online in 2016 and ramp up to 2.5 bcf/d by
2020, meets about 40% of the gas production growth target. Other than that, Saudi
Arabia is focusing on getting unconventional production off the ground to meet the

More clarity required, but high level benefits becoming evident
The recent National Transformation Program (NTP) document provided a much awaited
articulated roadmap through 2020 of how the government is seeking to achieve its
highly ambitious Vision. However, we believe significantly more detail is still required
before the market can make more concrete conclusions on the key winners and losers
from the program as well as quantify the impact it could have on corporate earnings
(both positive and negative).
Whilst at this juncture it is difficult to quantify the size of the NTP opportunity for
individual companies, we feel more confident in highlighting the sectors that we see
could benefit from Saudi Arabia ambitious plans. We have detailed the sectors that we
see as likely benefiting most in the table below. We also highlight the sectors which
could face the most negative impact from the roll out of the NTP.

— which has a large stake in the company — had a good chance of succeeding in its efforts to obtain a seat on the board of
Microsoft, especially if Ballmer stayed in place.

And even if the software giant was able to thwart that from happening, said several sources, such a public fight is untenable
for the company, since it was likely to attract even more scrutiny to Ballmer’s performance and perhaps even more investor
action.

ValueAct has until August 30 to notify Microsoft if it plans a proxy battle, and sources said it still wants more that Ballmer’s
retirement. In talks, said sources, it has asked for an aggressive stock buyback and also a dividend increase, which might
assuage its efforts to garner a board seat.

Ballmer denied any pressure from ValueAct specifically in his decision in an interview with the Seattle Times, though
sources said that was simply bluster.

And, even with mounting pressure on him, Ballmer definitely portrayed the change as his decision in an interview he gave to
ZDNet’s Mary Jo Foley last week, after his retirement announcement.

“| would say for me, yeah, I’ve thought about it for a long time, but the timing became more clear to me over the course of the
last few months,” he insisted.

When asked if Gates asked him to stay or go, he said no, apparently to both. “Bill respects my decision. | mean, it’s one of
these things when if it’s — you know, ultimately these kinds of things have to be one’s own personal decision.”

That statement also struck many inside the company as a quick shift. Ballmer, said sources, had been jumping
enthusiastically into business review meetings, as part of the new structure, over the last month. In addition, he had
expressed to many employees his excitement at being part of the changes he had initiated.

But, in meetings after the announcement, numerous sources inside the company said Ballmer seemed uncharacteristically
chastened and quiet, in contrast to his usual confident and forceful manner.

“He was definitely not leaving and then he suddenly was,” said one source. “Even if today’s Steve made the choice, itwas a
choice yesterday’s Steve did not want to.”

Another source, close to the board, perhaps explained it best: “If ValueAct got on the board, | think Ballmer finally realized
that meant it was going to be the hard way from then on out until he left and he did not want that for a company he clearly
loves and has been his life.”

Now, those inside the company are turning to what comes next. While not everyone on the board thought that Ballmer
should step down without a new CEO in place, it’s moot now as Microsoft turbocharges the process — in place for several
years now — to select its next leader.

But, though the committee is headed up by John Thompson, CEO of Virtual Instruments and the former CEO of security
software giant Symantec, most expect Gates — as usual — to be the key decision maker on that choice, too.

A Microsoft spokesman declined comment.

The Decline of E-Empires
Paul Krugman — New York Times

Steve Ballmer’s surprise announcement that he will be resigning as Microsoft's C.E.O. has set off a huge flood of
commentary. Being neither a tech geek nor a management guru, | can’t add much on those fronts. | do, however, think |
know a bit about economics, and | also read a lot of history. So the Ballmer announcement has me thinking about network
externalities and Ibn Khaldun. And thinking about these things, I’d argue, can help ensure that we draw the right lessons
from this particular corporate upheaval.

BREAKING NEWS 
Summers withdraws from Fed race 
Lawrence Summers has taken himself out of the running to be the 
next chair of the Federal Reserve, withdrawing his name after 
opposition from key Democratic senators indicated they would 
oppose his nomination. 
Mr Summers, a former Treasury Secretary and senior economic 
adviser to Barack Obama in his first term, galvanised opposition 
among left-of-centre Democrats who painted him as symbol of the 
wrongs of financial deregulation.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012772.txt,"religion looks like a case of exaptation — an expression of human thoughts and emotions that originally
evolved to solve problems other than cooperation, but once in place were swiftly adopted for solving
problems of cooperation.

Further evidence in support of religion as exaptation comes from a follow-up to the dictator game
experiment discussed above. If you swap religious words for non-religious but moral words such as civic,
duty, jury, court and police, you get the same results: people give more money when thinking about these
morally-pregnant, but non-religious words. It is also the case that if you paste up a photograph of eyes
next to a money box for coffee, people give more than with a photograph of flowers. What these two
studies show is that words and images that make us think about others, especially the possibility that
others are watching, turns us into bigger spenders. These psychological transformations are not, however,
specific to religion. Some may think that God is watching, but they and others may also think of a white-
bearded, gavel-wielding, atheistic judge.

We learn three important lessons from the study of tameness and religion, lessons that will propel
our discussion of evil. First, distinguish what something evolved for from what it is used for. Second,
dissect complicated traits down into their component parts as the parts, together with their inter-
dependence, may have different evolutionary histories. Third, the combination of independently evolved
capacities can lead to novel adaptations and possibilities. Some combinations lead to altruistic and
humane compassion toward those we don’t know. Others lead to virulent hatred and annihilation of those

we do know. The brain’s promiscuity is a driving engine for both the good, the bad, and the ugly.

From the shackles of monogamy to the freedom of promiscuity

Many years ago, some American friends of mine were married in a small village in Tanzania. After the
wedding, they went to a local official who was responsible for providing a marriage certificate. On the
certificate were three choices, indicative of the type of marriage: Monogamous, Polygynous, and
Potentially Polygynous. My friends chuckled, but aimed their pen with confidence at Monogamous.
Before they could ink the certificate, however, several Tanzanian men shouted out “NO! At least
Potentially Polygynous. Give yourself the option.” Right, the option. The freedom to explore.

Among social animals, only a few species pair bond for life, or at least a very long time. This fact
is equally true of the social mammals: less than 5% of the 4000 or so species are strictly monogamous.
For these rare species, most of their efforts to think, plan, and feel are dedicated to their partner; what’s
left over goes into finding food and avoiding becoming dinner. Life is much more complicated for the rest

of the social animals. Their social and sexual relationships are more promiscuous, less stable and less

before they were hijacking famous websites, injecting world-class malicious code
into opposition computers and demonstrating a digital attack fluency. 21° Of course
the charming side of such a shift is evident too: Walk the Vatican with an historian in
your ear, master sourdough in a weekend. There’s something not a little miraculous
in the way the networked tools to recombine DNA or hack computer code or design
viral software are getting both more sophisticated and simpler. If earlier eras put
epoch-making implements into human hands - the knife! the train! - our age is now
placing new, mind-shaping forces within instant reach.

In a networked world, economic or military power doesn’t come just from
controlling territory or information alone. It comes, more and more, from this
matery of the temporal. Securing territory today does not, alone, solve many
problems of safety. Control of information, of topologies and finally of time - this is
what matters most. Such temporal security will be elusive; always in need of
defense. The arrival of airpower in World War Two, for instance, shifted battles
from two to three dimensions. “Only large states are able to resist three-dimensional
envelopment,” the historian Nicholas Spykman wrote in 1942.21! Even today, “Air
Superiority” is the precondition of nearly any American war. If we can dominate you
from above, nearly anything seems possible. But networks add a fourth dimension.
“Time Superiority.” Can you move faster than your enemy? Can you bog them down?
Or are you a victim of fourth-dimensional envelopment. Control of time - yours,
your enemies - this will decide your strength.

Back in the fall of 1988, at about the same moment that Danny Hillis and his team
were busy peddling their amazing Connection Machine - and trying to smash every
world computing speed record they could find - another device appeared in the
world of massively parallel super computers. It was, everyone who saw it agreed, an
extremely strange machine. It’s appearance was completely unexpected. It’s
designer was not a famous thinker about parallelism, cavorting with TV network
founders and physics Nobelists. In fact, its very success emerged from this strange
face: The creator knew basically nothing about the sort of parallel design that
informed Hillis’ thinking. Which was strange, because it was far more “parallel” than
the Connection Machine could ever be. It was also cheaper. Simpler. And: It was
faster. In fact, it was the fastest parallel machine in history.

The machine began, quietly enough, in the mind of a 28-year old Cornell graduate
student named Robert Tappan Morris. Morris came by his computer chops honestly
enough: He was the son of Robert Morris Sr., the legendary NSA scientist we
encountered several chapters ago, the man who penned those partly amusing, partly

Rationale

Investors should re-assess attractiveness of popular and {typically} technically motivated longer-
dated RV vol trades, given environment of structurally higher political & economic risks and
increasingly limited policy options

Cheap equity upside in a bond / equity melt-up

Risks of a hard Brexit rising and (weak) currency tailwind likely to prove short-lived; position
cheaply for FTSE 100 (UKX) underperformance

Remain long equities and cheapen hedges by conditioning on rates

China risk premium rising but A-shares vol still at all-time lows
Equity-FX correlation is not priced for a spillover of populism into the EU, which could cause EUR
0 fall against an already weakened GBP as equities fall

UKX is heavily exposed to EU (50% revenues) and should underperform SPX if GBP tailwind
ades. Volatility & correlation suit well for outperformance

Cheapen long XLF upside to near 8y lows via selling upside on structurally challenged European
banks & relatively more bearish outlook for US rates vs EU

USDJPY and NKY the biggest beneficiaries of a Trump win

Banks and Insurance are the most leveraged sector

Banks and Insurance are the most leveraged sector

China risk premium rising but A-shares vol still at all-time lows

Own contrarian EM upside at low cost & limited risk

QE uncertainty and USDJPY vol support NKY vs SPX realized vol

What if QE hits its limit? Long NKY vol outright which is cheap to carry

With fiscal stimulus and potential tax cuts, small caps revert to old normal generating higher vol
on upside and downside relative to large caps

Vol and price technicals are attractive. BofAML commodity strategists oil target is $70/bbl but this
is already priced in SXEP levels according to BofAML Oil & Gas equity analysts

Position for a near-term wobble followed by yet another equity melt up

Cheaply access positive carry QE failure hedge

Position for a pick-up in single stock realised vol on the 10 names (within FTSE’s top 30} where
post EU referendum realised vol was the highest relative to current 1y ATMf vol. The 10 names
are: Barclays, Aviva, Prudential, BT, Glencore, Tesco, CRH, BA, Standard Chartered & HSBC.

Hedge portfolios against a buy-the-dip failure should a faster rate cycle ultimately jeopardize it

he MSCI inclusion theme; Hedge with 2823 HK Jun17 95% put

Market may trade on the MSCI inclusion theme; Hedge with 2823 HK Jun17 95% put
Historically attractive to own TOPIX Top 10 corridor gamma weighted volatility dispersion
Hedge a rollover in China GDP and screen for cyclicals that could face pressure

Hedge a rollover in China GDP and screen for cyclicals that could face pressure

Benefit from low vol, flat correl, likely hawkish ECB & (FX un-hedged) inflows into EU equities
Leverage inexpensive equity vs. FX vols to own cheap tail protection

Buy inexpensive EM equity puts on near-record performance gap to commodities

Monetise low vol & high implied correl to position for greater sector dispersion in EU: long basket
call, short worst-of call

Own inexpensive NKY hedges into FOMC; Term structure is too steep is under-pricing risks
Buy out-of-favour and inexpensive biotech upside by levering depressed vol & skew

Market may trade on

Buy EEM puts financed by a basket of EM puts to lever near record low correl

Hedge a potential China tech bubble; Tencent potentially volatile after a 45% rally YTD

Hedge the upside into MSCI announcement on 20-Jun

Fundamental case to be long EU equities remains intact but stretched bullish positioning could
lead to near-term consolidation
BofAML Equity & Credit strategists highlight they favour equities over HY credit as div yields have
surpassed HY credit yield & equities o

er more gearing to rising PMI's, earnings and FCF

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021306.txt,"understanding the behavior of others. If
your brain mirrors the neural activity in
the brain of someone you see acting, this
could provide a basis for understanding
the motivation for the action. If your
brain resonates to the observed action as
if you were acting, this could call to
mind previous experiences acting that
way providing a memory for why you
acted that way. That is, our social brain
may directly resonate to the actions of
others without reasoning explicitly about
those actions. This kind of mechanism,
through which intentions might be
inferred, could then prepare responses
quickly to facilitate the smooth flow of
social interactions whether in a game or
a dialogue. Of course, a critical aspect
of such a mechanism is to differentiate
our resonance to other people’s actions
and the control of our own. This kind
of neural system for mapping the actions
and intentions of others has been
identified with a network of regions
called the mirror neuron system °, and
this system may help to induce a degree
of reflexive similarity or identification
between self and other. The mirror
neuron system appears to be
continuously engaged unless it is
actively suppressed by inhibition, so that
this system may continuous monitor the
behavior of ‘others’ in our social
environment.

Of course, mapping the
movements of the opponent is useful,
but certainly not sufficient to defend our
position, score a point, or win a match.
One needs to execute countermoves.
This is the domain of the motor system
in the brain, which includes regions
involved in the preparation and
execution of motor action. The motor
system is responsible for the
implementation of one’s goals and
intentions to perform an action®. Thus,

Page | 60

the social brain includes monitoring and
motor systems that function in parallel.
The mirror system puts the player in the
opponent’s shoes and monitors the
opponent’s actions in an anticipatory
manner. Other parts of the social brain
maintain the distinction between player
and opponent by shaping the
implementation of one’s actions, namely
by engaging a counteraction.

In sum, a tennis game or any
social interaction depends on a complex
network of brain regions that mediate
perception and action, and the
relationship between observed action
and one’s own behavior. The overlap in
brain regions responsible for these two
important social functions suggests how
tightly coupled and coordinated social
interactions can be. However, these two
systems cannot operate in isolation from
our knowledge of the context in which
behavior occurs. We, therefore, turn to
this topic next.

The Social Context

In a tennis game or any social
interaction (e.g., dancing, conversation),
the behavior of one individual
constitutes a stimulus for others. If a
behavior is meaningful, then neural
mechanisms responsible for social
perception and social interaction are
likely to be activated to engage in
complementary action. In a competitive
context, such as the tennis game, the
motor system is engaged in the
preparation and execution of
complementary actions to those
observed and anticipated based on the
inferred goals and intentions of the
competitor. However, if everyone shares
the same goal, for example, as in an
audience clapping, the neural systems
for monitoring the actions of others and
executing one’s own actions can be

Cannabis Investment Report | December 2017

Production Equipment and Supplies

Production equipment and supplies include the physical components used in cannabis production.
Many industry participants in this subsegment provide products to a broad range of fully legal indus-
tries and do not “touch the plant’; therefore, these participants typically do not require special cannabis-
related licenses and generally avoid legal risks related to violations of federal law.

Some components of cannabis production are similar or identical to components used in other
agricultural industries (such as irrigation systems), and some are specialized for application to the
cannabis industry (such as extraction machines). Components supplied for many indoor and green-
house cultivation facilities include electrical lighting equipment, air filtration and circulation systems,
irrigation systems, nutrient management systems, drying and curing equipment, and computer-
controlled automation and monitoring systems. Specialty cannabis equipment companies now provide
“all-in-one” automated indoor cultivation systems that can be used for in-home cultivation or scaled
for commercial purposes.

Extraction System Cultivation System

Production and Testing Services

Production services include cannabis extraction and product manufacturing services provided primar-
ily on a business-to-business basis to cultivators, consumer product companies and retail dispensaries.
Extraction companies invest in specialized equipment that transforms cannabis flower into concen-
trates intended for wholesale. Product manufacturing services companies process cannabis flower or
concentrates, or provide packaging and wholesale services.

Testing services include scientific testing of cannabis products and reporting of information about
product quality, safety and composition. Cannabis products are tested at multiple stages of pro-
duction for genetic information and strain verification, cannabinoid and terpene composition and

Anti-Bribery Provisions

Electricity Commission senior officials to travel to Michigan to inspect Company A's facilities. Because it is a lengthy
international flight, Company A agrees to pay for business class airfare, to which its own employees are entitled
for lengthy flights. The foreign officials visit Michigan for several days, during which the senior officials perform an
appropriate inspection. Company A executives take the officials to a moderately priced dinner, a baseball game,
and a play. Do any of these actions violate the FCPA?

No. Neither the costs associated with training the employees nor the trip for the senior officials to the Company's
facilities in order to inspect them violates the FCPA. Reasonable and bona fide promotional expenditures do not violate
the FCPA. Here, Company A is providing training to the Electricity Commission’s employees and is hosting the Electricity
Commission senior officials. Their review of the execution and performance of the contract is a legitimate business purpose.
Even the provision of business class airfare is reasonable under the circumstances, as are the meals and entertainment,
which are only a small component of the business trip.

Would this analysis be different if Company A instead paid for the senior officials to travel first-class with their
spouses for an all-expenses-paid, week-long trip to Las Vegas, where Company A has no facilities?

Yes. This conduct almost certainly violates the FCPA because it evinces a corrupt intent. Here, the trip does not appear
to be designed for any legitimate business purpose, is extravagant, includes expenses for the officials’ spouses, and therefore
appears to be designed to corruptly curry favor with the foreign government officials. Moreover, if the trip were booked as a
legitimate business expense—such as the provision of training at its facilities—Company A would also be in violation of the
FCPA's accounting provisions. Furthermore, this conduct suggests deficiencies in Company A's internal controls.

Company A's contract with the Electricity Commission is going to expire, and the Electricity Commission is
offering the next contract through its tender process. An employee of the Electricity Commission contacts
Company A and offers to provide Company A with confidential, non-public bid information from Company A's
competitors if Company A will pay for a vacation to Paris for him and his girlfriend. Employees of Company A
accede to the official's request, pay for the vacation, receive the confidential bid information, and yet still do not
win the contract. Has Company A violated the FCPA?

Yes. Company A has provided things of value to a foreign official for the purpose of inducing the official to misuse
his office and to gain an improper advantage. It does not matter that it was the foreign official who first suggested the
illegal conduct or that Company A ultimately was not successful in winning the contract. This conduct would also violate
the FCPA's accounting provisions if the trip were booked as a legitimate business expense and suggests deficiencies in
Company A's internal controls.

strategy have regarded the matter? What does gatekeeping tell us?

The dominant view of future relations between Americans and Chinese generally
runs along a nervously familiar historical track: An established power (the US) anda
rising one (China) consider each other. Do they cooperate? Scratch at each other in
constant annoyance? Each nation possesses a different image the world. Each holds,
as well, distinct pictures of their role. One power has enjoyed a long period of
prosperity, has built and defended a global structure; the other, trod mercilessly
underfoot by history, feels the unbearable flow of power’s rising sap, a hunger for
recognition and release and for some, revenge; her economy craves resources, trade
routes, and markets. So Germany encountered and then attacked Great Britain at the
turn of the 20 Century. Japan collided, similarly, with Russia in 1904. France taking
on Austria, Russia and Great Britain in the Napoleonic age.

Even if the leaders of the United States and China intend to avoid conflict, they face
one of the most sobering, if not depressing, problems of international politics: The
“security dilemma”. The world is a dangerous place. So countries do things to feel
safer. Their populations demand it. Germany looks at Britain’s imperial navy in the
1890s: London could snap Berlin’s trade arteries. So the Kaiser orders two
battleships. Britain builds three in response. Germany turns to submarines. And so
on. Each country, chasing her own security, ends up /ess secure. This is the
“dilemma”. The puzzle is like one of those woven wicker finger traps: The harder
each side pulls to get out, the more stuck they become. America in 2012 pivots her
military gaze to Asia. China feels encircled. She orders a couple of aircraft carriers,
paves remote islands into military bases. America flies aircraft closer to Chinese
waters. Are the two sides more secure? Collisions, arms racing, accelerating distrust
become the threnody of contacts. Each side seeks something impossible: Perfect
security. Move first, certain forces begin to whisper in each capital.

The essence of this problem today, as the United States and China consider their
future, is not merely or even mainly in the details of trade, territory, or cyber
disputes we read about. These hot points are important, of course, but they are
symptoms of differing judgments of the world, of a fracture at that first step of
asking, “What is the nature of the age?” Americans generally believe the existing
global power map is just, sustainable, in need — perhaps - of minor adjustments.
America engineered this system; benefits tremendously from it’s fictionless
operation. China regards that same layout differently. As broken, unbalanced,
rocking towards a seizure — and, anyhow, built, lubricated and run without her
participation. This view is sharpened by ideology, national psychology and the bald
fact that no global mechanism ever functions perfectly. The larger nature of the age
is, many in Beijing feel, Da po, Da li. Great destruction. Great construction. Certainly
this is true inside China; it must be true outside. The nation has it’s hammers out.
They see the paradoxes of power we read about earlier, the inability to act and the
collapse of American credibility, as clearly as people in Washington or Damascus or
Moscow. Surely the global system should be adjusted, they think. Tap. Tap.

2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, #849

Discussions about the Amendment began again soon after the 2000 presidential elections. On April 15, 2002, Senators Kyl and
Feinstein reintroduced the Amendment in the Senate, 7? and the following day, President Bush announced his support. °° On
May 1, [*850] 2002, a companion measure was proposed in the House. ®! On January 7, 2003, Senators Kyl and Feinstein
proposed the amendment as Senate Judiciary Resolution 1. The Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings in April of that year,
82 followed by a written report supporting the Amendment. *> Shortly thereafter, a motion to proceed to consideration of the
measure was withdrawn when proponents determined they did not have the sixty-seven votes necessary to pass the
amendment. After it became clear that the necessary super-majority votes to amend the Constitution were not attainable,
victims’ advocates turned their attention to enacting a comprehensive victims’ rights statute.

C. The Crime Victims’ Rights Act

The Crime Victims’ Rights Act ultimately resulted from a decision by the victims’ movement to seek a more comprehensive
and enforceable federal statute rather than to continue pursuing the more ambitious goal of a federal constitutional amendment.
In April 2004, victims advocates met with Senators Kyl and Feinstein to decide whether to push yet again for a federal
constitutional amendment. Conceding that the amendment had only majority support in Congress rather than the necessary
super-majority, the advocates decided to press for a far-reaching federal statute protecting victims' rights in the federal criminal
justice system. 54 In exchange for backing off from the federal amendment in the short term, victims’ advocates received near-
universal congressional support for a broad and encompassing statutory victims’ bill of rights. 8° This new approach not only
established a string of victims' rights but also provided funding for victims’ legal services and created remedies for the violation
of victims' rights. 8° The victims' [*851] movement is currently evaluating the success of the statute before deciding whether
to continue pushing for a federal amendment. */

The Crime Victims' Rights Act gives victims the right to participate in the system. °° To facilitate such participation, the Act
grants victims eight specific rights:

(1) The right to be reasonably protected from the accused;

(2) The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding, or any parole proceeding, involving the
crime or of any release or escape of the accused;

(3) The right not to be excluded from any such public court proceeding, unless the court, after receiving clear and convincing
evidence, determines that testimony by the victim would be materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that
proceeding;

over the coming quarters should support UK companies as 70% of revenues are generated abroad.

¢ Energy is the largest sector of the UK market. While the oil price eased sharply over the past months, we
expect it to stabilize in the second half of 2012. An attractive valuation of the energy sector at 6.5x trailing
earnings provides some buffer for earnings volatility going forward.

e Profitability of UK banks is reasonable. They are less affected by the sovereign debt crisis than their
Eurozone peers. While the recent easing of collateral requirements by the Bank of England is supportive in
the short-term, the profitability of the domestic operations could be negatively affected by the
implementation of the ring-fencing bank reform by 2015.

¢ UK equities’ P/E, at about 10.0x trailing, indicates attractive value relative to global equities. Based on our
12-month forward earnings growth estimate of about 5% and the P/E multiple slightly expanding to 10.3x,
we expect UK equities to show good returns over the next six months.

4 Positive scenario FTSE 100 (6-month target): 6,650

¢ Continued global growth and strong demand from emerging markets should support demand for
commodities, helping the Materials and Energy sectors to lead the market higher. The market could re-rate
to a P/E multiple of close to 12.0x, and we would expect earnings growth of 5-8% over 12 months.

& Negative scenario FTSE 100 (6-month target): 4,400

e A global recession drags UK earnings down by 15-20%. The market's defensive characteristics would only
partly offset its strong exposure to commodity-related sectors. We would expect the trailing P/E multiple to
drop towards slightly below 9x.

Note: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)

What we're watching Why it matters

Growth indicators Business survey indicators provide information on the economic development in
the UK. Key date: 2 July, PMI manufacturing for June; 4 July, PMI services
for June;

Commodity prices Energy and Materials together are about 30% of the UK market by market

capitalization. Developments in commodity prices affect earnings estimates.
Policy action Loose monetary policy by the Bank of England (BoE) supports equities. Key date:

05 July, Bank of England policy meeting

Preference: overweight

Recommendations

Tactical (6 months)

e We like the Energy sector due to
attractive valuations; Consumer Staples
is another preferred sector Because of
its defensive qualities.

e Approaching the end of the patent cliff
should remove some uncertainty on the
Healthcare sector and enable a re-
rating.

Strategic (1 to 2 years)

e As commodity-related sectors, Energy
and Materials should benefit from
robust demand in emerging markets.

e The UK market's 4% dividend yield
provides a good income stream.

TIIC Group backed by Edmond de Rothschild, is a pan-European infrastructure firm advising on mid-market
infrastructure projects across Europe in both the transportation and social sectors. It was established in 2008
by the 3 founding partners of TIIC Group, Jaime d’Almeida, Manuel Cary and Francisco Mendes, with strategic
support from the Edmond de Rothschild Group and Brisa.

The aim of TIIC Group is to bring an operational approach to infrastructure investments in Europe, drawing
upon the extensive management and financial skills of its team members. These skills have been developed
over many years at some of Europe’s leading infrastructure operators and project financing firms which,
when combined with the very specific infrastructure expertise of both the Edmond de Rothschild Group and
Brisa, makes for a powerful and differentiated investment platform.

TIIC Group operates from two offices in Lisbon and Paris, providing its team with access to relevant
investment opportunities across key target markets in Europe as well as to leading industrial contractors,
operators, advisors and financiers in the infrastructure industry.

TIIC Group successfully raised a First Fund with €140m of commitments targeting transportation investments
across Europe. The portfolio of the First Fund comprises 6 assets located in Portugal, Spain, France and
Poland. They represent a carefully balanced mix of greenfield and early stage brownfield projects in roads
and car parks. TIIC Group has played an active role in the sourcing and development of all investments and
has made a significant contribution to value creation. TIIC Group believes that this is a high quality,
operationally secure, cash yielding portfolio of assets which will be of strong interest to potential investors
over the coming few years.

TIIC has launched a successor fund, TIIC 2, which will build upon TIIC Group’ differentiated approach to
infrastructure in Europe. TIIC 2 will is targeting aggregate commitments from investors of €300m (€350m
hard cap) to invest into both transportation and social infrastructure projects in Europe. TIIC 2 will also seek
to invest, ona very selective basis, into greenfield social infrastructure projects in New Frontier Markets,
within close proximity to the European Union. Given its powerful network of relationships across Europe and
the operational skills of its team, TIIC Group will continue to target superior investment returns for TIIC 2’s
portfolio of assets. These returns should be in line with the anticipated returns from the First Fund portfolio
which is forecast to deliver a gross IRR of up to 14% and a multiple of approximately 2x on invested capital.

TIIC announced the first close of TIIC 2 on December 30 2016, with aggregate commitments of €135m from
a group of high quality and well-diversified limited partners. First close investors in TIIC 2 include the
European Investment Bank and Edmond de Rothschild, both with significant commitments, as well as the
TIIC team. TIIC 2 is also supported by a number of existing investors, together with several European
insurance companies, pension funds and family offices. A second close is planned in the coming months and
the final close will occur before the end of 2017. We have received significant interest from a number of

Dear Professor Krauss, 
We met briefly after your talk in Ithaca a few months ago — I'm the girl on The Skeptics' Guide to the 
Universe podcast. I've really enjoyed your talks and books, but I was surprised to see you quoted in the 
Daily Beast recently defending Jeffrey Epstein: 
http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2011-04-01/bill-clinton-katie-couric-woody-allen-jeffrey-
epsteins-society-friends-close-ranks/2/  
Can you confirm if the following quote is accurate? 
If anything, the unfortunate period he suffered has caused him to really think about what he wants to do 
with his money and his time, and support knowledge, says Krauss. Jeffrey has surrounded himself with 
beautiful women and young women but they're not as young as the ones that were claimed. As a scientist I 
always judge things on empirical evidence and he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've 
never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were I would 
believe him over other people. Though colleagues have criticized him over his relationship with Epstein, 
Krauss insists, I don't feel tarnished in any way by my relationship with Jeffrey; I feel raised by it.

Brexit look like a walk in the park.

2017 —- Reflation, Reversal, Rotation, Relief or Revolt?

2017 is likely to have a number of cross currents as themes. Recovery and Rotation go
hand in hand. The stronger the recovery the more yields can rise the more we can see
the rotation extend. Should investors become concerned that the recovery is stalling or
that yields are peaking the rotation would likely stall potentially even reverse. Reversal
refers to the ECB. Our economists are not yet convinced that the ECB will start to
unravel some of its easing measures in 2017 but they do expect the debate to be a
vigorous one within the ECB. For the first time Gilles Moec thinks there is a chance that
the ECB will indeed choose to taper. Relief or Revolt relates to the French election. Will
Europe follow the UK and US lead of 2016 and go down the route of populism (revolt
from the voters) or will we find relief for the markets if by the end of 2017 froma
Fillon/Merkel duo being in charge of the two largest economies in the Euro Area.

Recovery - the world looks a better place going into 2017
Reflation has been the big theme of the second half of the year. As we had noted in
previous publications there had been something of an improvement in the global growth
picture emerging even before the US election. It started with Emerging Market growth,
which our GEMScycle has been showing to be accelerating for some months, but seems
to have spread to other parts of the developing world. US GDP for Q3 has just printed a
revised 3.2%, with a number of indicators, such as ISM’s, PMI’s and consumer
confidence pointing to a solid Q4 to follow. That quarter is currently tracking at 3.6%
according to the Atlanta Fed.

The Euro Area too is showing signs of improvement with the latest manufacturing PMIs
back to their best since early 2014 with other national surveys, such as Ifo pointing in
the same direction. The composite PMI is back close to the year highs too. The UK
numbers continue to surprise on the upside too for the moment. Our economists are
also upbeat on Japan with growth expected to accelerate next year as the fiscal stimulus
kicks in.

Accordingly our economists expect growth to rise from 3% this year to 3.5% in 2017
and 3.8% in 2018. That acceleration in growth is despite a slightly slower US economy
in the first half of the year as a higher USD and interest rates dampen growth before
the fiscal stimulus kicks in. With growth firming and oil prices expected to be higher
inflation is also expected to pick up through 2017 and 2018 to 2.8% and 3%
respectively. At this stage it is worth noting that this is a modest acceleration in both
growth and inflation.

11 Places With a Worse Economy Than USA 
By Rick Newman — Fri Jul 10, 11:50 am ET 
When times are tough, one thing that tends to raise the spirits is knowing that somebody else has it worse. And as wretched as the 
U.S. economy seems, its not as bad as in other regions. 
The International Monetary Fund's latest tally of world economic conditions forecasts a 2.6 decline in U.S. economic output for all of 
2009, and anemic growth of 0.8 percent in 2010. That's more optimistic than the IMF's prediction from three months ago, but those 
are still lousy numbers. A weak economy throughout 2010 would mean a bleak employment picture, an agonizingly slow housing 
recovery, and another year or two likely to feel like a recession, whether its technically labeled that or not. 
We should count ourselves lucky, though. The IMF expects at least 11 major parts of the world to have more severe economic 
contractions than the United State this year, including most of western Europe, Japan, Russia, and Mexico. Europe will still be 
stumbling along behind the United States next year, as well. Here are the IMF's projections for economic growth in various parts of 
the world: 
2009. 2010 
China. 	7.5. 	8.5 
India. 	5.4 	6.5 
Middle East 2.0 	3.7 
Africa. 1.8 4.7

If these projections come true, it means the United States, despite its overspent consumers, wrecked banks, and insolvent auto 
makers, will be leading the world economy out of recession. Somehow. The developing world will help, but those high growth 
projections in China and India can be deceiving. 
China in particular has government policies that practically mandate high growth, and 8.5 percent in 2010 would be just about the 
bare minimum to keep employment at tolerable levels. And neither China nor India is a major buyer of American-made goods and 
services; for the most part, its the other way around. With much of the developed world trailing the United States, it will take 
American consumers to ratchet up demand for the world's products. Scary thought. 
How to tell when a real recovery begins.? 
4 Ways to Tell When a Real Recovery Has Begun 
You could conclude just about anything from the daily cavalcade of economic statistics. Some suggest an imminent recovery. Others 
seem to foretell years of gloom. The bent of the expert interpreting the latest news—bull, bear, Obama-basher, Wall Street-hater—
has as much to do with the outlook as the numbers themselves. 
For the foreseeable future, there will be an aggressive hunt for two economic recoveries. One is the technical improvement in 
economic indicators that signals the economy is growing again. That's the one economists care about, which is why they scour the 
numbers on retail sales, business inventories, purchasing manager sentiment, subatomic inflation, the mood in Shanghai, and 
anything else that could help pinpoint the exact inflection point for a turnaround. 
The other recovery, the one that most consumers are waiting for, is the one in which companies stop firing and start hiring, banks 
return to normal lending, and families stop worrying about jobs and income. And that turnaround—the consumer recovery—is likely 
to take much longer to materialize than the technical recovery. 
The danger of hyping a technical recovery is that it will arrive, with much fanfare—but fail to make ordinary consumers feel better 
off. Many economists, for example, are predicting that the recession will officially end by this summer or fall. The only problem is 
that when a technical recovery begins, a lot of companies fail to get the memo. They don't play along; they keep payrolls lean and 
maybe even continuing to lay off workers. So to guard against false optimism, here's how to tell when a real recovery is finally 
kicking into gear: 
Unemployment improves. The single best indicator of the health of the economy is the job market. People who have lost their job, or 
worry that they might, obviously hoard their money and don't spend. That spells doom for an economy driven by consumer spending, 
as ours is. But once its clear that jobs are coming back, consumers are more likely to relax and open their wallets. 
Projections about unemployment should make anybody queasy about the prospects for a recovery this year. The unemployment rate 
is currently 9.4 percent, a steep rise from one year ago, when it was an unremarkable 5.5 percent. And by most accounts, its going to 
get worse. The International Monetary Fund expects the U.S. unemployment rate to be 10.1 percent in 2010. Economist Gary 
Shilling thinks unemployment will hit 11.4 percent and not peak until late next year. 
Its hard to imagine a recovery in which jobs are even more scarce than they are now. When the unemployment rate finally starts to 
go in the other direction, we can start to think about putting the umbrellas away. Until then, no number of upticks or volume of 
optimistic talk will persuade Americans worried about their jobs that they should part with precious cash. 
Housing prices stabilize. This has become a mantra by now: For the economy to get healthy, housing prices must stop falling. 
Problem is, the houses haven't been listening. 
Housing matters for two reasons: It represents a big chunk of the economy, and its the largest single repository of Americans' 
household wealth. With prices falling, buyers are scarce, since nobody wants to buy an expensive good today if its going to be worth 
less tomorrow. With few buyers, all the other economic activity that swirls around real estate—remodeling, appliance and furniture 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021232 
sales, relocation services—is depressed. Homeowners are worse off, too, because the value of one of their vital assets is eroding. 
House prices have already fallen by 32 percent nationwide from the 2006 peak. And they have further to go. The latest readings on 
the S&P/Case-Schiller home price index, one prominent measure, showed another record decline in May. At some point, the declines 
will moderate and stop being records. But prices need to stop falling altogether, and probably rise, for a real recovery to happen. The 
Federal Reserve thinks home prices could stop falling in 2010, after a total decline of 41 to 48 percent. Other metrics, like housing 
starts and new-home sales, might point upward before then. Those will be signs of signs of a turnaround, not the real thing. 
Household wealth increases. The housing bust and the volatile stock market have hammered the traditional investment tools that 
most Americans use, causing epic declines in the wealth of Americans. Since 2006, household net worth has declined by about $12 
trillion, which equates to about $107,000 of lost wealth for each of America's 112 million households. That's partly because of the 40 
percent plunge in the stock market since October 2007 and partly because of the steep declines in real estate values. 
Americans simply own less, too. Home equity for the typical homeowner is just 41.1 percent, a record low. In 2002, it was 58.4 
percent. Owning less means we owe more and will have to rebuild savings before we can spend like we used to. This will be a drag 
on all discretionary purchases, says Dirk van Dijk, an analyst at Zacks Investment Research who thinks the tightfistedness will cut 
into the earnings of firms ranging from hotel chains to furniture makers to motorcycle manufacturers. Those are the same kinds of 
companies that need to start hiring again for a real recovery to develop. But they won't if sales stay sluggish. A turnaround will 
require sustained stock market gains and an end to the housing bust. 
President Obama stops fudging on the economy. There's still a lot that could go wrong, and Obama knows it. Yet part of the 
president's job is to reassure skittish Americans, even as his economic lieutenants are fighting battles in the war room. That's why 
Obama has been making half-hearted pronouncements, like saying that the economy shows some return to normalcy and that we 
expect there'll be some stabilization of the economy. Virtually all of Obama's remarks on the economy contain modifiers and future 
tense and a not-quite-there-yet quality, since hell blow his own credibility if he tries to convince Americans that they're better off 
than they actually are. When Obama starts hedging less, be happy. That will signal better days. Finally. 
The IMF does offer a bit of more heartening news: The global wipe out finally seems to be receding. The world economy is 
stabilizing, the IMF reports. Its global economic growth projection of 2.5 percent in 2010 is 0.6 points higher than predicted in 
April. But the global economy isn't expected to gain its footing in earnest until the second half of 2010. Maybe by then American 
spenders will have come out of hiding. 
Obama says stimulus plan to kick in later this year Reuters 
Obama says stimulus plan to kick in later this year 
By Tom Doggett — Sat Jul 11, 3:13 pm ET 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) — President Barack Obama said Saturday more time was needed for his $787 billion stimulus package to 
work, predicting the spending would have a bigger impact on the economy later this year. 
In an advanced text of his weekly radio speech, Obama said the stimulus plan approved by Congress and signed into law in mid-
February was not designed to work in four months -- it was designed to work over two years. 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said it was too soon to decide whether the U.S. economy needed the help of a second-
round of government stimulus to recover from recession. 
I don't think that's a judgment we need to make now, can't really make it now prudently, responsibly, he said in a taped interview 
with CNN that will air Sunday. 
According to a transcript provided by CNN, Geithner said the biggest thrust of the stimulus package signed into law earlier this 
year would take effect in the second half of the year. 
Obama's comments follow government data showing the unemployment rate soared to 9.5 percent in June, the highest level since 
1983 and above the 8 percent peak predicted by the White House when it worked with Congress to pass the package. Republicans 
say the stimulus plan is not working. 
Obama now warns unemployment likely will top 10 percent in the coming months. 
We must let (the stimulus plan) work the way its supposed to, with the understanding that in any recession, unemployment tends to 
recover more slowly than other measures of economic activity, Obama said. 
He said the benefits of the plan would accelerate greatly throughout the summer and the fall. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021233 
The continuing recession and further steep job losses are wearing away the patience of Americans and raising doubts about Obama's 
handling of the economy. 
The share of Americans who believe the stimulus package will restore the economy slipped to 52 percent in late June, down from 59 
percent two months earlier, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll. 
Vice President Joe Biden said the administration had misread how bad the economy was when it took office but that the stimulus 
package would help the economy recovery and create jobs. 
Senate Republican Leader Mich McConnell Friday called the stimulus plan a failure. 
Obama said it takes time for the plan's money to get out the door to pay for roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects that will 
create jobs because we are committed to spending it in a way that is effective and transparent.

Alan Dershowitz

On November 10, 2015, Alan Dershowitz arrived at Shriver Hall,
on the campus of Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, to talk
about the Arab-Israeli conflict.

“The outlines for peace are so obvious,” he said. “There has
to be a two-state solution.”

Fifteen minutes into the talk, a group of women—students
belonging to a group called Hopkins Feminists—stood up in
protest. Dressed all in black, with duct tape over their mouths,
they held up a sign and marched out of the hall.

YOU ARE RAPE CULTURE, the sign read.

Afterward, a reporter for the student paper asked Dershowitz ~
about Jeffrey Epstein and Epstein's victims. Wasn't it true that Der

showitz had implied that one of those victims was “asking for it?”

“Pm a defense attorney,” Dershowitz replied. “I have an obliga- ~

The Department of Commerce offers a num-
ber of important resources for businesses, including the

regarding exporting their products and services. Among
other things, these specialists can help a U.S. company con-

instance, can be part of a US. business’ evaluation of poten-
tial overseas business partners. Businesses may contact the
Commercial Service through its website, http://export.gov/

Additionally, che Department of Commerce’s Office
of the General Counsel maintains a website, http://www.

to translations of the FCPA, a catalogue of anti-corruption

of Commerce’s International Trade Administration hosts
a website with anti-bribery resources, http://tcc.export.

which U.S. companies can report allegations of foreign
bribery by foreign competitors in international business

complying with anti-corruption laws. For example, the
Department of Commerce has included a new anti-corrup-

by market experts at U.S. embassies worldwide, that contains
information on market conditions for more than 100 coun-

The Department of Commerce has also published a guide,
Business Ethics: A Manual for Managing a Responsible
Business Enterprise in Emerging Market Economies, which
contains information about corporate compliance pro-

The Departments of Commerce and State also pro-
vide advocacy support, when determined to be in the
national interest, for U.S. companies bidding for foreign
government contracts. The Department of Commerce’s
Advocacy Center, for example, supports US. businesses
competing against foreign companies for international con-
tracts, such as by arranging for the delivery of an advocacy
message by US. government officials or assisting with unan-
ticipated problems such as suspected bribery by a competi-
tor.” The Department of State’s Bureau of Economic and
Business Affairs (specifically, its Office of Commercial and
Business Affairs) similarly assists U.S. firms doing business
overseas by providing advocacy on behalf of US. businesses
and identifying risk areas for U.S. businesses; more infor-
mation is available on its website, http://www.state.gov/e/

serving overseas provide commercial advocacy and support
for U.S. companies at the many overseas diplomatic posts
where the Commercial Service is not represented.

The Department of State promotes U.S. government
interests in addressing corruption internationally through
country-to-country diplomatic engagement; development
of and follow-through on international commitments relat-
ing to corruption; promotion of high-level political engage-
ment (e.g. the G20 Anticorruption Action Plan); public
outreach in foreign countries; and support for building
the capacity of foreign partners to combat corruption. In

could buy the book for the $50,000 that the houseman had asked for it. THREE
months later, the FBI and the same AUSA that had headed my prosecution set up my
houseman in a sting. It appears that while using a lawyer from the RRA firm, Brad
Edwards, as a confidential informant for the government at the same time that Scott
Rothstein was using me and the allegations against me to fleece his victims, the US
attorneys’ office was sitting in the Rothstein offices planning a sting operation, while
right next door, Scott Rothstein was making off to Morocco in an attempt to flee the
country. Alfredo Rodriguez was prosecuted by the same AUSA and received an 18-
month sentence; however, it also appeared that on the very same day of his sting
arrest, he bought an illegal gun, and was later sentenced to four years in prison.
Who Cara Holmes is, and what her role was in RRA is still a mystery to us. She
appears to be a former FBI agent out of the Chicago office. She joined the Rothstein
firm in May of 2009, and joined the Florida Bar at the same time. She attended
depositions of my pilots and my houseman. She communicated regularly with Brad
Edwards and the investigators on my case. The email traffic is extensive.

The telephone book that sy Rodriguez had stolen from my house was then
turned over(by the government?) to the same attorneys who had been told they
could not buy it as s they would have been buying stolen property. Brad Edwards, the
former partner of Scott Rothstein, then used the purloined book to send out letters
to everyone in the book, asking for additional stories of my wrongdoing in the past
five years with the hopes of getting new clients. The letter was structured so as to
circumvent the ethical rules regarding trolling for clients.

While I was serving my sentence, my lawyers were able to come see me in jail. Only
two months after being incarcerated, my in house lawyer came to see me to tell me
that we were now conducting an audit of legal fees paid to date. They had
discovered that Gerald Lefcourt, my primary attorney, had taken out cash to
the tune of $800,000, that according to his own accountant, he was not entitled to.
He had simply prepared invoices that said, “Please pay another $100,000 or
$200,000”. Though he had been asked on multiple occasions to substantiate the
bills, his response would be, “We are working full time for you”. I pointed out that
his was not the only firm working for me, but he replied, “Would you like me to
quit?” He eventually returned over $400,000 over a period of time, as he said that
his cash flow could not handle the strain. He said that he was still owed for things
like taxi fair, coffee and doughnuts, detailed for $2.53, and would keep $400,000.

I was told that I should hire Guy Lewis, a former US Attorney in the Southern
District. Lewis, a southern style gentleman; white suits, fast cars; said he had a great
relationship with the current US Attorney, Alex Acosta, and the people in

to indicate which categories (out of a list of 30) they purchased on Amazon in the past
30 days. Our data shows that Personal Care Products and Vitamins & Supplements were
more likely to be purchased (vs. the average across all categories) by both Prime and
Non-Prime members throughout 2018.

Taking a closer look at 4018, in each month (on average) 19% of all Amazon Prime
Purchasers bought at least one personal care product and 15% purchased a Vitamin or
Supplement, while the average purchase rate across all 30+ categories was only 12% of
Prime purchasers. We noted a similar trend among Non-Prime Purchasers in 4Q18, with
13% who bought Personal Care Products and 10% who bought Vitamin or Supplements,
compared to the average purchase rate across all categories of 8%.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012982.txt,"66 4 Brief Survey of Cognitive Architectures

seem remotely capable of giving rise to such phenomena. It seems to us that the creation o
a successful emergentist AGI will have to wait for either a detailed understanding of how the
brain gives rise to abstract thought, or a much more thorough mathematical understanding o
the dynamics of complex self-organizing systems.

The concept of cognitive synergy is more relevant to emergentist than to symbolic archi-
tectures. In a complex emergentist architecture with multiple specialized components, much o
the emergence is expected to arise via synergy between different richly interacting components.
Symbolic systems, at least in the forms currently seen in the literature, seem less likely to give
rise to cognitive synergy as their dynamics tend to be simpler. And hybrid systems, as we shal
see, are somewhat diverse in this regard: some rely heavily on cognitive synergies and others
consist of more loosely coupled components.

We now review the DeSTIN emergentist architecture in more detail, and then turn to the
developmental robotics architectures.

4.3.1 DeSTIN: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach to AGI

The DeSTIN architecture, created by Itamar Arel and his colleagues, addresses the problem
of general intelligence using hierarchical spatiotemporal networks designed to enable scalable
perception, state inference and reinforcement-learning-guided action in real-world environments.
DeSTIN has been developed with the plan of gradually extending it into a complete system for
humanoid robot control, founded on the same qualitative information-processing principles as
the human brain (though without striving for detailed biological realism). However, the practical
work with DeSTIN to date has focused on visual and auditory processing; and in the context of
the present proposal, the intention is to utilize DeSTIN for perception and actuation oriented
processing, hybridizing it with CogPrime which will handle abstract cognition and language.
Here we will discuss DeSTIN primarily in the perception context, only briefly mentioning the
application to actuation which is conceptually similar.

In DeSTIN (see Figure 4.4), perception is carried out by a deep spatiotemporal inference
network, which is connected to a similarly architected critic network that provides feedback on
the inference network’s performance, and an action network that controls actuators based on the
activity in the inference network (Figure 4.5 depicts a standard action hierarchy, of which the
hierarchy in DeSTIN is an example). The nodes in these networks perform probabilistic pattern
recognition according to algorithms to be described below; and the nodes in each of the networks
may receive states of nodes in the other networks as inputs, providing rich interconnectivity
and synergetic dynamics.

4.3.1.1 Deep versus Shallow Learning for Perceptual Data Processing

The most critical feature of DeSTIN is its uniquely robust approach to modeling the world
based on perceptual data. Mimicking the efficiency and robustness by which the human brain
analyzes and represents information has been a core challenge in AI research for decades. For
instance, humans are exposed to massive amounts of visual and auditory data every second
of every day, and are somehow able to capture critical aspects of it in a way that allows for
appropriate future recollection and action selection. For decades, it has been known that the

<http://www.vani-tyfair.com/online/daily/2on/o3/notes-on-
new-yorks-oddest-couple-jeffrey-epstein-and-ghislaine-
maxwell.html> 
by Vicky Ward <http://www.vanityfair.com/contributors/vicky-ward> 
March 8, 2011, 2:30 PM 
I've got a story idea for you. The rebuilding of Indonesia. Or New Orleans. Or both. Go there. I've just been. 
You will never think the same way about anything again. 
So spoke not Bill or Melinda Gates, but Ghislaine Maxwell, the 48-year-old woman being written up 
everywhere at the moment as the alleged procurer of young women for billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. 
Epstein, 57, is the financier who spent a year in jail on charges of soliciting prostitutes—and now there is talk of 
another investigation because various women, now in their twenties and thirties, have come forward with 
allegations that he molested them when they were under-age. The allegations first surfaced in British 
newspapers, which have zeroed in on Epstein's friendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tried to 
publicly disassociate himself from his old pal. 
I wrote a piece for Vanity Fair in 2003 called The Talented Mr. Epstein. It was largely a business piece that 
focused on his mysterious exit from Bear Stearns in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne, Les 
Wexner, the chairman of Limited Brands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude 
Hoffenberg, who is currently serving a 20-year-jail sentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of 
$450 million. 
The piece alluded to Epstein's great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women 
with whom he had sexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn't really go there, focusing instead on the 
issue that remains a mystery—how Jeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers. 
This is not to say I didn't hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I 
concentrated on the intriguing financial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same 
ones, different ones. And their stories are bone-chilling. Journalists from England have phoned—and, in one 
case, flown—to ask me about Epstein and Maxwell. Who is he? And the British, especially, want to know: Who 
is she? At this point, I am so bored of repeating myself to others—it was, after all, my 2003 Vanity Fairstory 
that really brought him into the limelight—that I have decided to write about this myself. 
Bizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to know Jeffrey and Ghislaine far better after my piece than before it. I kept 
running into both of them, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of 
young women with him who stand two feet behind him, as if serving a monarch. Do they speak? I remember 
asking him once, nodding at his lookalike blondes. He laughed. Not like you,Vicky, was his riposte. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030472 
I remembered that when we'd once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I hadn't 
studied math since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a package at 
home via messenger. It was a book: Math for idiots. 
So he is not without humor, even though he doesn't drink or smoke, and hates restaurants. 
Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects, newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He 
was certainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few 
moments in his company and you know this to be true. 
When I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that 
Andy—as Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his 
strange title is. Because if one thing's for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what 
he's talking about far more than Andy does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other 
financiers hang out with him. 
And Ghislaine? 
Full disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It's almost impossible not to. 
She is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I've spent hours 
talking to her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is 
curious. She has spent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent 
me a DVD of the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away almost anyone else's I can think of—probably even 
Rupert Murdochs'. She is very well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill 
Clinton with whom she is close friends. 
Yet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-
Platero, (known fondly to her close friends as the Tennis Goddess) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When 
it comes down to things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her vulnerability. 
And that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey. 
He saved her, I remember a close friend of mine telling me. When her father died, she was a wreck; 
inconsolable. And then Jeffrey took her in. She's never forgotten that—and never will. 
In many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect 
replacement for her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his 
sexual pecadillos, but then Ghislaine's father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving 
a massive black hole he'd fraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey's habits may not have seemed that 
strange. 
In fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful 
people in the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl 
issues, and moved countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You 
don't tend to get to the top by being the world's most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett 
didn't quite manage a normal life—whatever that is. He had a second wife for many years whose existence he 
has been open about. 
So what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven't spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her 
loyalty to friends like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about as always. Look 
at Waksal and Stewart. No one sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up for 
all sorts of blemishes.

image. The 35-page Defense Intelligence Agency’s damage assessment, for example, that said
that 900,000 Pentagon documents were compromised by Snowden, was not made public. It was
only disclosed via a Vice magazine Freedom of Information request in June 2015.

What is known is the number of documents that Snowden gave to journalists in Hong
Kong. As will be recalled, Poitras and Greenwald were “writing partners.” When Greenwald
discovered that his copy of the documents were corrupted, Poitras made a copy of the thumb
drive that Snowden gave her in Hong Kong and sent it to her Greenwald in Rio de Janeiro by a
courier. That courier was intercepted by British authorities at Heathrow Airport. When
examined, the Poitras-Greenwald thumb drive contained some 58,000 documents. This meant
that the lion’s share of the 1.3 million documents that the NSA claimed were compromised had
not been given to journalists and is unaccounted for.

The numbers game is not only misleading nut unenlightening on the issue of the value of the
compromised documents. Many of the putative 1.3 million documents that the NSA says were
copied and moved were duplicate copies. Others were outdated or otherwise useless routing data.
So the quantity does not tell the story. Of far more importance than the quantity of the total haul
is the quality of some of the data that Snowden had copied. Just a single one of these documents
could cripple not just the NSA but America’s entire multi-billion dollar apparatus for intercepting
foreign intelligence. The previously-cited summary of requests by the CIA, FBI, Pentagon and
other agencies for communications intelligence, for example, which was 31,000 pages long, listed
all the gaps in U.S. coverage of adversaries, including those cited by President Obama’s national
security team. As Ledgett warned, this single document, if it fell into enemy hands, would provide
out adversaries with “a roadmap of what we know what we don’t know and imp/licitly a way to
protect themselves.” The “roadmap” was not found among the files on the thumb drive. Nor
were most of the missing level 3 lists concerning NSA activities in Russia and China found on the
thumb drive, even though Snowden said he took taken his final job at Booz Allen to get access to
these lists. If Snowden had not given these documents to Poitras, Greenwald or other journalists,
where were they?

The compartment logs showed that Snowden copied and transferred these level 3 documents in
his final week at the NSA. He presumably had them in his possession in Hong Kong after he
arrived on May 20, 2013. On June 3™, according to Greenwald, he was still sorting through the
material to determine which ones were appropriate to give to journalists. On June 12 2013, he
told reporter Lana Lam in Hong Kong that he was going through the documents, country by
country, to determine which additional ones he should pass on to journalists. Eleven days later, he
departed Hong Kong for Moscow carrying at least one laptop computer. Even after arriving in
Moscow, he suggested he still had NSA secrets in his possession. No intelligence service — not
even our own — has the capacity to compromise the secrets I continue to protect, “ he wrote to
former Senator Gordon Humphrey, “I cannot be coerced into revealing that information, even
under torture. Much of the material he copied while working at Booz Allen remained, as far as
the NSA could determine, missing. Had he brought these files under his “protection” to Russia?

from 10x to 5x of the gross individual annual income; and, 4) increase the real

e The Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage is looking to increase and
develop hospitality facilities and tourism services. The ministry targets by 2020 to
increase the number of hotel rooms/apartments by 39% to 621.6k.

Positive government ambitions but...

The rise of real estate finance to non-oil GDP from 8% to 15% implies an incremental
funding of US$32bn which could finance c212k additional units by 2020 or c53k
additional units p.a. This compares to an estimated annual demand of 181k units which
come on the top of the existing cl.2mn shortage of housing.

..needs to be combined with land tax and sukuk issuance initiatives

Based on the target Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) set for the Ministry of Housing,
we estimate the initiative to be supportive but not sufficient to cater to the natural
annual demand which is 3.5 times more elevated than the implied additional supply
funded by the programme. We understand this initiative has to be combined with the
land tax initiative and the potential sukuk issuance from the Ministry of Housing which
could add further liquidity to the REDF to finance more units.

Land tax - gradual revenue source

Land tax among flagship measures adopted by the Saudi government

We expand more below on our understanding of the land tax initiative which was
recently approved by the Cabinet to tackle the housing shortage and raise government
revenues. Saudi Arabia’s Cabinet announced in November 2015 that it will gradually levy
a 2.5% tax on undeveloped land plots owned by persons or private entities in urban
areas, after the country’s Shura council approved a proposal to impose taxes on the so-
called white lands. The draft law was amended to include gradual taxes in accordance
with a specific timetable to force landlords to sell land, thus increasing land supply.

The regulations adopted in mid-June define undeveloped land as all vacant land
dedicated to residential use or commercial residential use within the urban boundary
limits. Fees will be applied to in a gradual series of stages; first, to owners of
undeveloped land with areas exceeding 10,000 square metres; second, to single owners
of developed land of more than 10,000 square metres in one master development plan;
third, to single owners of developed land of more than 5,000 square metres in one
master development plan; and, last, to single owners of land of more than 10,000 square
metres in one city. The Ministry of Housing will determine the land locations where the
tax will apply. The extension of the tax in later phases to developed land, from
undeveloped ones at first, will broaden the tax base and minimize tax evasion.

Tax proceeds will be deposited in SAMA

The taxes and fines collected by the Ministry of Housing shall be deposited in the
central bank, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, and will be used to develop the
country’s infrastructure for new housing projects, according to the state-owned news
agency.

Law could be effective this month, but gradual implementation likely

Under the new system, the housing ministry has been in charge of issuing executive
procedures and rules for the new legislation within 180 days. The law will be effective
180 days after publication in the official gazette. The housing ministry is finalizing
necessary amendments to the decree by end-June 2016 and aim for implementation by
17 January 2017 (including a 1-3 year grace period).

XXXvili The Crooked Course

Resolution at the Khartoum Summit, which is referred to as the “Three Noes Docu-
ment” due to its clause that states: “no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no
negotiations with it”. On 6 October 1973, Syria and Egypt launched a war against Israel
that ended in a political stand-off between Israel and its Arab adversaries.

In November 1977, Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat broke Arab unity when he—
in a move which stunned the world—flew to Israel and addressed the Knesset in a bid
for a peaceful resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Subsequently, in 1978, he signed
the Camp David Accords that established a separate bilateral peace agreement with
Israel.

Camp David highlighted the importance of a third-party broker. When President
Sadat and his counterpart, Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel, reached a
stalemate, US President Jimmy Carter invited the parties to his presidential estate for
trilateral discussions on 5 September 1978. Three scheduled days of negotiations
turned into thirteen days of frustrating and intense talks. Since these tripartite discus-
sions were unable to break the impasse, President Carter decided to work separately
with both sides. The result was an American proposal which incorporated the require-
ments of both parties into a single text. After lengthy negotiations on this document,
President Carter’s shuttle diplomacy resulted in the Camp David Accords of 17
September 1978.

In 1993, PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat followed the precedent of President Sadat and
broke ranks with fellow Arab leaders by secretly and bilaterally recognizing the State of
Israel and signing the Oslo Accords. The year after, building on the agreements
between Israel and the PLO, King Hussein of Jordan followed suit by negotiating a
bilateral peace treaty with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel. This culminated in a
spectacular signing ceremony at the desert border crossing of Wadi Araba in August
1994. In the agreement, Israel acknowledged Jordan’s historical role over Muslim holy
sites in Jerusalem and agreed to recognize this role in future permanent status
negotiations with the Palestinians. The two leaders also agreed on steps such as the
opening of border crossings and economic cooperation.

In 1999, Labor Party leader Ehud Barak defeated incumbent Prime Minister Benja-
min Netanyahu. As has been described above, the new Prime Minister broke radically
with the concept of gradualism that had been the hallmark of negotiations between
Yasir Arafat and three Israeli Prime Ministers, Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres, and
Benjamin Netanyahu, favoring a more comprehensive approach to the peace process.
For the first half of 2000, Arafat and the Palestinians were left to wait for a Syrian peace
deal that was not to come. Despite Barak offering Syrian President Hafez al-Assad 99
per cent of the Golan Heights, it still fell short of Assad’s demand for a return to the 4
June 1967 lines, and the Syria track subsequently crumbled. This put Arafat on the
spot: how could he now, in front of the Arab world, accept less for the Palestinians than
Assad had demanded for the Syrians?

The Lebanon track fared better. It began in late 1999 with a dialogue between Prime
Minister Barak and me, as the newly appointed UN Special Coordinator for the Middle
East peace process. The Prime Minister confided to me that, as a part of his compre-
hensive quest for resolving all the conflicts that Israel had with its neighbors, he wanted
to end Israel’s occupation of Southern Lebanon that had started in 1978. Eventually, he

Topics: US debt ceiling negotiations, a more ambitious European bailout plan (finally), and how large cap growth stocks
and rising corporate profits are patiently waiting for both of them to end

I have a feeling that revenue increases will be a material (e.g., 25% or more) part of the deal. The Peterson Foundation’s
sampling of 6 policy groups shown below indicate that 5 of 6 recommend revenue increases compared to where we are today;
the Heritage Foundation’s “Woody Guthrie Memorial Budget Plan” is the only exception. What kind of revenue increases?
Raising the top two brackets, which would affect joint filers with adjusted gross incomes above $212,300, would raise $450-
$700 billion over 10 years (depending on whether you use OMB or CBO numbers). If they cannot agree to raise rates, another
option (as in the Gang of Six plan) would be reductions in the deductibility of state and local taxes, sales taxes, mortgage
interest, etc. As this gets sorted out, let’s hope everyone recognizes that the US tax system is already progressive. As shown in
the chart below, effective Federal tax rates for low earners have dropped to zero over the last decade, even after including FICA
taxes. News reports that the US tax system is regressive make me want to throw hamburgers at the screen.

Europe: Finally (1!), but now what?

For the first time since 2009, it felt last week like European policymakers were trying to get out in front of things. In exchange
for a modest amount of “private sector involvement”, Germany agreed to more generous financing terms for Greece, Ireland
and Portugal, and an expanded role for the EU-IMF lending facility (see following page). What would the plan accomplish if
implemented? While Greek debt to GDP ratios would remain well over 125% of GDP (the IMF estimate for next year is a
ridiculous 170%), Greece’s near-term financing obligations would decline, due to debt buybacks, exchanges into long maturity
bonds, and interest grace periods on new EU loans. More broadly, the plan also allows for money to be lent to countries before
they enter into an IMF program, for recapitalization of banks. All things considered, it’s the broadest defense of the
Monetary Union so far. On paper, it even looks like a free ride for holders of Greek paper that don’t participate in the debt
exchanges (they would be paid at par). So, what’s not to like? Well, there are still questions about Greece:

e ©There’s a big difference between generous financing terms and generous economic terms. Greece must still meet an
enormous 5%-6% primary budget surplus target (government revenues less spending, pre-interest) during a recession

e Greece must execute on its asset sale targets, despite having little success or experience doing this in the past

e Banks listed in the ITF document (the committee representing them) are under no binding legal obligation to participate in
the debt exchanges, and may turn out to own less Greek debt than currently believed. [Note: bank participation in the Latin
Brady bond era was high, since at the time, banks held almost all the paper, and in the form of illiquid loans].

The big question: would Germany still live up to the deal if Greece missed deficit targets or assets sales, if bank participation
was too low, or if hedge funds (once referred to by the Chairman of the German Social Democratic Party as a “swarm of
locusts”) reaped large free rider windfalls? Ultimately, this is a political question. If “yes”, Germany will underwrite Greece
no matter what; if “no”, then a broader, coercive Greek restructuring might follow in the not-so-distant future’.

> This could get complicated. If there is a need for further debt forgiveness for Greece, will policymakers find a way to “ring-fence” the
banks that participated in the first round, and impose losses just on the hold-outs? Will the EU tell banks that if they don’t participate, their
older bonds will not be eligible for financing at the ECB? >

THE 
CONTROL 
FACTOR 
Our StrEas.gle to Sec the Trite Threat 
BILL SIEGEL 
FrontPage Interview's guest today is Bill Siegel, a lawyer and business 
executive. He has been a producer of several documentary films and assists numerous non-profit 
organizations. He is the author of The Control Factor: Our Struggle to See the True Threat. 
FP: Bill Siegel, welcome to FrontPage Interview. 
Congratulations on this brilliant book. It is without question one of the most vital works of our time. 
Let's begin with what inspired you to write it. 
Siegel: Thanks for having me Jamie. As a young boy born in the mid 1950s, I was fascinated with footage of 
Hitler and the Third Reich and could never understand how the Jews of the time could not see the evil that 
seemed so obvious. Not yet appreciative of the benefit of hindsight, I could not comprehend the blindness. 
Following 9/11, like so many others, I began to study Islam, its history, its current movements, terrorism and 
so on. As I would learn one stunning aspect after another, I would discuss them with friends and associates. 
Rather than confront the facts I would present, they would find one clever way after another to avoid the 
frightening truth of what America and the West truly face. Their fear appeared obvious to me. I began to 
catalog many of my friends' different maneuvers to dispel the anxiety that they found so difficult to endure. 
The more I focused on their mental processes (as well as my own) the more I began to see a structure to the 
mental endeavor and to understand what I had, as a child, found so difficult to explain. 
FP: Tell us about the Control Factor, what you describe as that effort our minds enga ge in in order to keep 
us blind and that process of a voiding seeing the threats we face. It's also about, as you state, trying to 
believe that the threat is under our control, when in fact it is not. Kindly enlighten us as to these profound 
insights you make in terms of the Control Factor. 
Siegel: First, let's distinguish the real world where real battles are taking place from the mental battlefield 
which occurs in each of our minds. We tend to believe our perceptions are simply clear realizations of what is 
out there and overlook how much our internal worlds can literally determine what we see. When our 
internal minds become anxious and sense a loss of control, they tend to concoct ways to distort our 
perceptions so as to restore that sense of inner control. I describe the Control Factor as an active and 
continuous process designed to maintain that sense, if not illusion, of control. We natural ly think that our 
thinking and feeling processes are passive; that they just happen. Yet when faced with truly frightening 
prospects, the mind is geared to actively distort. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024408 
Similarly, the sense of control must be continuously maintained so the Control Factor operates constantly. In 
turn, the sum of this active and continuous undertaking makes these perceptions all the more familiar and thus 
seemingly all the more real. In one sense, the Control Factor is the mechanism of what Andy McCarthy 
entitled one of his numerous excellent books- willful blindness. The Control Factor is cleverer than we are 
aware; that is almost tautological as, if our minds are to create ways to keep us in denial, they must out 
maneuver our conscious thinking. 
Since World War II, America has had limited experience with threats coming to the homeland. Most of 
America's history has been about over there, where we have always known that if things got too out of 
hand (e.g. Vietnam) we could always ret urn home. The current generations, for a wide array of reasons, have 
had virtually no experience with a threat to this land. (The documentary, Generation Zero, is interesting on 
this point). 
Consequently, the process of waking up to such a threat parallels the arc of a typical horror film. In such a 
film, there is typically a cast of characters surrounding one or two main characters. We in the audience know 
there is a threat coming — be it a monster, a virus, a psycho killer, an alien, the blob that ate Cincinnati etc. 
This threat is typically defined by its intent- the singular goal of destroying the characters. Much of the initial 
exposition shows how the characters first are oblivious to the destruction the threat brings about, then explain 
it in familiar terms only to finally open their eyes to see that something uniquely terrifying is happening. The 
next stage usually involves a series of failed attempts to deal with the threat- fr om trying to negotiate with it, 
to appease it, to coax it, to threaten it with ineffective weapons and so forth. Most of these failings are due to 
not adequately appreciating the threat for what it truly is and projecting onto it a host of other attributes 
instead. The final stage generally involves a back-up-against-the-wall decision by whichever characters 
remain alive. I named this the turnaround moment when the character becomes willing to be as ruthless as 
the threat. That change in mental state is necessary to ensure survival. Ultimately, the storyline is a race for 
whichever characters remain to wake up fully and use whatever advantages they may still have to beat the 
threat. 
This is the same arc our minds go through in battling our own Control Factors, our own compulsions to deny 
that which is staring us in the face. Ultimately, the question is whether we will be able to wake up while we 
still have advantages and give ourselves permis sion to fully fight the battle we are in. 
I said ear her that there is a structure to the Control Factor. To oversimplify, I view it much as a pyramid 
where on the bottom are the many minute by minute thoughts that are manipulated. I call this level of 
maneuvers the many D's as they include the psychological defenses such as distortion, denial, 
demonization, deflection, deletion, detachment, delusion, displacement, discolorization and so forth. Layered 
upon these are moves such as projection, where we can assign to our Islamic Enemy traits we wish to see in 
them or introject traits from them into ourselves that we wish not to acknowledge. These maneuvers involve a 
mixing of identities where we actually lose clarity about who we are and who the enemy is. Projection and 
introjection are active almost across the board. It is always helpful, for instance, to ask how what the enemy 
accuses us of is more appropriately descriptive of it. When we add Western Guilt and Shame, our need to be 
liked, and o ther psychological dimensions, basic thoughts solidify into larger fantasies. 
As these narratives (Our courts will never allow that, As a superpower we will always be able to win any 
fight we put our minds to, Assimilation will ensure Muslims are westernized ...) gain consent from others 
they tend to guide us deeply and become infused on our policies. Ultimately, what emerges is a relationship 
we take with our Islamic Enemy that parallels that between an addict and an enabler. Emblematic of this 
relationship is the transfer of responsibility in which we assume responsibility for the enemy's behavior 
who is addicted to transferring it away from itself The Control Factor actively maintains this relationship and 
makes changing that relationship as difficult a chore as any addict finds in breaking his addiction. And just as 
an addict needs to devote serious effort and con sciousness to his addiction, so must we devote great energy to 
unders tanding how the Control Factor ultimately sabotages us. 
FP: Describe the threat we face in our Islamic enemy. And you talk about the three levels of jihad against us. 
What are they? 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024409 
Siegel: Simply stated, our Islamic Enemy seeks the totalitarian domination of Islam throughout the world — 
Islamic supremacy. It seeks to have the West submit to Islam. Obviously, this does not mean that everybody 
becomes a Muslim. Islam, in all its varied expressions, permits dhimmis- those Christians, Jews, and some 
others who are permitted to remain as protected non-Muslims as long as they submit to an inferior status. 
What is critical is that Shariah (Islamic Law) ultimately rules the world. 
Jihad, loosely, is the effort/struggle to see this vision through. The most obvious method of Jihad is through 
violence; it is the one most familiar to most Westerners and almost all of the Koranic references to Jihad are 
based in violence. The Violent Jihad includes al-Qaeda and its offshoots as well as other groups that formed 
around the globe independent of al-Qaeda. It also obviously includes the violence from Islamic nations such 
as the Islamic Republic of Iran whose constitution specifies such vision. It also includes, however, various 
militant groups and training camps here in the US as well as ad hoc efforts of individuals. 
Since 9/11, there have been something in excess of 15,000 Violent Jihadic attacks across the globe. However, 
as terrible as this is, we have a tendency in the West to think that the only dimension of threat we face comes 
from violence. While the Bush administration helped initiate this thinking, the Obama administration has 
actively abused it by limiting any discussion of the threat we face to al-Qaeda and some other terrorist groups 
abroad. As frightening as these groups are, we can get some ease from thinking they are a band of extremists 
limited in number, weaponry, sophisticati on, and means. Stunningly, Hillary Clinton recently estimated that 
there are only about 50,000 homicidal violent extremists around the world who simply have been able to 
project power much greater than their number should allow. Here the Control Factor makes the threat appear 
more easily manageable. 
Jihad, however, is pursued in other often even more effective ways which I have grouped into three levels. 
A second more insidious level of threat is what the Muslim Brotherhood itself called the Civilization Jihad. 
It is the effort to infiltrate all aspects of our society, peacefully according to our laws, in order to later be in 
position to sabotage and destroy it from the inside. The Civilization Jihadists have learned the culture and 
rules of the territories they seek to command and use those rules to maneuver—specifically using our 
freedoms to destroy our freedoms. They use lawfare to seek changes in our laws so as to push Shariah into 
our society. Your readers should read Daniel Pipes and Brooke Goldstein's Lawfare Project material and 
others to fully appreciate how cancerous this activity has become. This includes intimidating in a variety of 
ways anyone who speaks out against them or Islam and seeking to squelch our treasured broad right to free 
speech so as to ultimately prevent any criticisms of Islam. Once criticism of Islam is prohibited, little can stop 
it from cascading throughout the culture. 
The Civilization Jihad includes situating such Jihadists in critical positions in the society, in the government, 
in the legal system, the military, and elsewhere. It includes the control over university programs that distribute 
propaganda about Islam and Islamic history which then filters down throughout textbooks for even younger 
students. It includes control over most of the nation's mosques and local Imams guiding the mess ages 
engaged Muslims are receiving. Most troublesome are the Muslim g roups (CAIR, ISNA, MSA and others 
associated and/or joint venture partners with the Muslim Brotherhood) supposedly interested in outreach 
which know how to appear Westernized and interested in the goals of Western Civilization. They have fooled 
a large part of our authorities and media due in part to their patience and willingness to chip away, one airport 
prayer room, one frivolous intimidating lawsuit, one Congressman or CIA officer, one mosque, one ruling at a 
time. 
Particularly in the US, given our deep attachment to freedom as well as cultural and psychological tendencies 
toward diversity, Western guilt and expectations of truthfulness, this effort is devious and difficult to uproot. 
The Civilization Jihadists present one face to the American public which is completely at odds with their true 
agenda and how they deal in private. Jamie, you and David and others such as Steve Emerson, Frank Gaffney, 
Andy McCarthy and others have done s o much to uncover this level of Jihad that your readers should be 
urged to review as much of their work (including Steve's recent excellent documentary, The Grand  
Deception,  and Frank's important web video course, The Muslim Brotherhood in America) as possible. 
Finally, there is a third level — the International Institutional Jihad. Here the most powerful international 
institutions such as the UN and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and others seek to push into America 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024410 
from without those changes which are difficult to complete from within. The OIC is the largest Islamic 
institution in the world. It essentially controls the vote in the UN's General Assembly and thus explains in 
part the absurd and abject pro-Islamic, anti-Israel thrust of that organizat ion. This level seeks to use the 
power of Islamic nations to work fro m outside the West to force changes within the West. While there are 
various conflicts between many of the nations, being Islamic majority states, there is a great deal they agree 
upon which becomes the focus of these efforts. Just as the Obama administration is beginning to cooperate 
with international efforts to control gun ownership, so has Hillary Clinton's Istanbul Process become a 
dangerous step in the effort to restrict speech critical of Islam by norm (or possibly even treaty) when it may 
not be fully executable by domestic action alone. 
I should point out that Stephen Coughlin, the former Pentagon officer who has an important must-see 
presentation of Islamic Law, uses different names for these same three levels — Jihad, Dawa, and Ummah. 
Had I seen his work before I wrote my book I would have conformed to his categorizations. 
We must learn how powerful language has become on all three levels. Words such as peace,. $B!1 
freedom, terrorism, and phrases such as human rights have different meanings for us and for our 
Islamic Enemy. To oversimplify, peace is not something for now but that which comes when all the earth is 
submitting to Islam. In the context of battles, peace is at best a temporary ceasefire. Freedom is best 
understood as having the freedom to fully submit to Islam, not to choose whatever beliefs one desires while 
respecting the same right in others. We've all seen how human rights and terror really only apply among 
Muslims, not to non-Muslims. Our enemy fully understands these differences and uses them at all levels to 
paralyze us. 
Look simply at how the phrase Israeli-Palestinian conflict has equalized the two parties, making it all the 
easier to ascribe features of one to the other and view the problem as a simple-to fix division of ass ets into 
statehoods but for personality problems among the leaders. The simple truth is that this is and has always been 
a one-sided Arab war against Israel as Ruth Wisse and others have described and, as Bibi Netanyahu made 
clear, the ONLY state truly at issue here has been the State of Israel that the Arabs have refused for over half 
a century. Nonetheless, the Control Factor hypnotically abuses the mind's susceptibility to the intricacies of 
language. 
Even the label Peace Process has been damaging language. While most focus upon the first word, turning 
this into a process has helped ensure that peace is never obtained. It is more appropriately called the 
Extortion Process because all that results is that violence is used over decades to extract concessions from 
Israel. 
These three levels must be understood for their differences while united by a single goal. While these levels 
often op erate together and assist each other, we must avoid level confusion which the Control Factor 
employs to curtail our fears. If the Obama narrative is swallowed- that the only threat is the Violent Jihad- we 
will miss the other contamination fomenting within our borders. We must appreciate how these levels work 
together and even unite with other forces such as the global Leftist movement that you, Jamie, have described 
so forcefully in United in Hate. 
FP: You write about how we like to talk of Good Muslims and how we are always on the eternal search for 
moderate Muslims (Khatami, Mousavi, Abbas, etc), while we stress how the extremists are the real 
problem and how few they really are. All of this is connected to the Control F actor. Enlighten us. 
Siegel: The Control Factor seeks to have us feel in control of the situation. The easiest way to do this is to 
simply minimize the number of potential enemies. We have been lectured for years about how Islam is a 
religion of peace and that the violence we see (remember that we have already improperly limited the 
problem to violence) is the product of a small number of crazies (remember Hillary Clinton's 50,000) who 
have distorted Islam. I call this the Peaceful Muslim Disclaimer as virtually everyone in the press and 
government has been bullied into making some statement of the kind to silence those who will pressure them 
that they are Islamophobic and Islam is being attacked. (These are the Islam hustlers who operate on the 
same principles that black race hustlers so effectively used to extort concessions over the last six decades or 
so). 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024411 
Nobody has done any real work to support this proposition, nor is it clear exactly how it would be tested. My 
view is that the grammar Islam is x is itself problematic because Islam has expressed itself throughout 
history in a variety of fashions. It is more useful to talk in terms of how seriously engaged with Islam, the 
Koran and other texts, a Muslim is. What is significant is how Muslims today are using Islam and most of 
those who are in power either throughout a large territory or within a small community tend toward, if not 
fully advocate, the very supremacist ideas that we try to tell ourselves are reserved for the 
few extremists. Presumably most Germans did not wish to see all Nazi atrocities carried out but in the end 
they fell in line because they had to. Those our politicians and press call the extremists are in one sense 
more accurately the good Muslims who ar e following their Islamic beliefs dutifully. 
FP: Tell us how Western shame and guilt play into all of this. 
Siegel: One of the dirty little secrets the Control Factor preys upon is that if we believe we control something 
we can comfort ourselves that we can change it. Remember the horror film- the threat has one purpose and 
that is to destroy you. You can not change it, talk it out of it, teach it alternatives or otherwise. That is what 
makes it so inherently frightening. If we can convince ourselves that we caused the threat to act the way it 
does we can maintain the secret hope that we can change it. Consequently, there is a tremendous attraction to 
blaming ourselves for the Islamic Enemy's behavior. And we see this power in our readily accepting 
responsibility for terror- because of our occupation, our greedy quest for oil, our failure to extend a hand of 
engagement, Israel's building settlements, our making videos that defa me Mohammed and so on. Again, 
the relationship is defined by the enemy blaming us for his actions and our accepting such responsibility. 
Shelby Steele has written brilliantly about what he calls white guilt and outlines how whites during the 60's 
and thereafter were pressured into a transaction whereby in order to re-obtain a sense of moral authority they 
accepted blame for the condition of blacks and behaved as if guilty. Blacks were able to extract great 
concessions and whites were able to view themselves as morally restored and redeemed. At a certain point, 
however, the behavior takes on a life of its own and the narratives become deeply embedded in the culture 
and, as we can see today, difficult to uproot. 
Western guilt is an extension of Steele's notion. President Obama's confessionals to the Arab world admitting 
that America has made mistakes and was not born a colonial pow er express this same tendency to appease 
through guilt. Hillary Clint on's reset with Russia conveyed the same submissive request for a more 
acceptable response. In being guilty we presume the other party will recognize our contrition and respond in 
like kind. One of the Control Factor's most devastating moves is employed- presuming the other is just like us 
and will respond the way we would. This is frequently how an enabler justifies his continuous support for an 
addict. The problem, however is that our Islamic Enemy is NOT like us and will not respond in like kind. 
Rather, as we repeatedly refuse to learn, appeasement invites more abuse from an enemy. This becomes 
the game of guilt; it tends to expand to greater and greater consequences. Paradoxically, psychological 
defenses tend to create the very outcomes they seek to eliminate and it is no different here. It is a game we 
love to play but, unfortunately, the game gives us no rules for how to end it. 
All beha vior is instructive. That is, we teach others how to treat us. The game of guilt, along with other 
Control Factor tools, teaches our Enemy it is winning and to continue playing. 
FP: The reason Nidal Hasan was able to perpetrate his murder spree at Fort Hood is precisely because of our 
Control Factor. Please connect the dots for our readers. 
Siegel: Just as I used to look at Hitler when I was young and be amazed that no one could see what he was 
about, in retrospect the same applies to Hasan. It is precisely all the elements of the Control Factor that could 
allow this man, a Soldier of Allah, to be positioned as he was. He was blatantly voicing his Islamist views and 
Jihadi intent including, even, an essay recommending the painful liquidation of non-Muslims. Yet, in the 
Army of all places, the Control Factor operated to allow and even foster his work. Even after the murders, we 
cont inue the denial by calling it workplace violence. He is the Civilization-Violent Jihad combo! And we 
continue to enable the same infiltration elsewhere. 
FP: Tell our readers about The Project and Explanatory Memorandum. These are realities that serve as 
great threats to the Control Factor, right? 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024412 
Siegel: These are separate sets of documents that outline the Muslim Brotherhood's goals and 
plans underlying the Civilization Jihad. The former was discovered in Europe and extends globally. The 1991 
Explanatory Memorandum emerged in 2008 from the Holy Land Foundation trial and describes the 
Brotherhood's work in America as a Civilization-Jihadist Process with all the word means and a kind of 
grand Jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and 'sabotaging' its miserable 
house by their own hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and God's religion is made 
victorious over all other religions. 
Much as the communists of the Soviet Union had formulated in the 1950s a detailed long term plan to 
destroy America (many of the effects of which we are seeing of late including destroying the nuclear family, 
secularizing the nation, feminizing men ...) these documents identify many strategies to infiltrate while 
eroding the foundations of our civilization in order to transform it into an Islamic one. The Control Factor has 
many ingenious ways to convince us that this is ridiculous, that our courts and system would never allow 
such a thing, that one is racist or Islamophobic, if not insane, for even thinking this is real. And just as with 
the communists, time is plentiful. Even more so with our Islamic Enemy, a multi-decade plan is short term. It 
is not critical that a seriou sly engaged Muslim lives to see the result. It is critical, more correctly a duty, 
however, that he carries on his Jihad. Patrick Poole and The Center for Security Policy's Team B Report, 
Shariah: The Threat to America, are excellent sources for your readers to pursue these documents. 
FP: And so what you call an Inner Jihad has to start. It's our, as you say, mandatory addiction treatment. 
Please explain. 
Siegel: The Inner Jihad is the effort we must undertake to gain control over our Control Factors. There is a 
famous Hadith in which Mohammad, returning from a successful battle, essentially says that the physical 
fight was the lesser Jihad and it is time to then attend to the greater Jihad 4- that internal battle against 
our own internal appetites, lusts, wrong thinking and so forth. While that Hadith has been falsely utilized to 
say that Jihad is not violent, it is useful to us as a symbol of the vicious effort we must take internally 
against our own Control Factor tendencies. 
As I said earlier, the Control Factor is active and continuous so we must constantly monitor and combat 
it. Like Whack-a-Mole, just as we may think we have addressed it, another variation pops right up. I use the 
terms addict and enabler because we truly need a form of rehab to break the habitual power of the 
Control Factor and because our relationship with our Islamic Enemy is very much like that between a typical 
addict and his enabler. And just as it is so difficult for an addict to kick his habit, so does the enabler act 
essentially addicted to his behavior and find it so difficult to change. At its core, the relati onship involves the 
transfer of responsibility for our Islamic Enemy's hate and resultant actions onto us with our response framed 
essentially as an effort to do what we can to try to address the Enemy's grievance. (Your book, United in 
Hate, describes this addiction to hate in detail. 
The key to the Inner Jihad is to learn to transfer responsibility for our Islamic Enemy's hate and resultant 
actions back to it and take responsibility back for our own situation. We must learn all we can about the 
enemy. We must unwind our inappropriate projections and introjections and rediscover who we are and are 
not. We must speak up. We must support those Muslims who promote expressions of Islam that are consistent 
with our principles. And we must stalk the C ontrol Factor, constantly be on guard for its intrusion. This is an 
individual endeavor as each of our Control Factors uses its own methods. The book gives plenty of examples 
of each maneuver discussed but it is important for each of us to discover the unique workings of his own 
mind. That takes the work of the Inner Jihad. 
FP: Share with our readers what you mean by the Turnaround Moment. 
Siegel: There is a moment in typical horror films where the central characters have been pushed to their limit. 
They then change and fully embrace the willingness to be as ruthless as the threat they face. No more moral 
high ground; no more futile attempts to ignore or change the threat's essence. As Lee Harris described in The  
Suicide of Reason, it is the willingness o r license to be (not necessarily actually being) as ruthless that is 
critical. It is a mental state that sheds all the prior counter-productive efforts at denial to finally clearly focus 
on the threat faced. Part of the Inner Jihad is to reach that Turnaround Moment sooner rather than later. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024413 
FP: You suggest that mirroring should be used as part of our arsenal. Tell us about it. 
Siegel: Mirroring is a literal approach to transferring back to the addict responsibility that we have been 
inappropriately accepting. Critical to the addict/enabler relationship is asymmetry. Like the addict, the enemy 
uses a less limiting set of rules than we do. The enemy typically initiates aggression while we respond only. 
Mirroring means that we demonstrate our willingness to act symmetrically, to be governed by the same rules. 
It is stunning how much is accomplished when one's attitude simply is clear that he will do what is necessary; 
often not much else is needed as the addict or enemy realizes the game is fundamentally changed. But other 
times action is absolutely needed. Demonstrating that we are not afraid to treat the enemy as it treats us 
carries great meaning. Imagine (international law aside) if Israel announced that from now on it will mirror 
Hamas such that if civilian populations are targeted by bombs from Gaza, Israel will do the same (it is 
accused of such anyway). The population might finally rethink and take responsibility for its privilege of 
voting its leaders. As stated earlier, all behavior is instructive and when we mirror we teach the other the 
effects of his behavior. 
Conversely, some situations demand that we assert asymmetry; those cases where it is necessary to highlight 
our differences with the enemy. Just this week, an disingenuous report was issued by an NGO drawing an 
equivalence between Palestinian and Israe li schoolbooks claiming that both sides have their relativistic 
narratives. Yet, as the Palestinian Media Watch's website has demonstrated for years, there is nothing in the 
West anywhere comparable to the hatred spewed daily by the Palestinian Authority, including through its 
education system. It is interesting to note that while the US State Department initially funded the study,- in 
what appears to be an attempt to sanitize the PA's record so that the US can continue to fund the PA against 
the spirit of US law- Hillary Clinton has a difficult time escaping her conclusion as Senator in 2007 that these 
schoolbooks along with other media profoundly poison(s) the minds of these children. It is most important 
that we do not succumb to this type of use of symmetry that distorts the profound differences between us and 
the enemy. 
Essentially, we are not clear as a nation, participating in a world with international rules, how to bes t fight 
this enemy. The first act of any rehab is to acknowledge that we do not know how nor are we yet competent to 
stop our addictions. This is not a book about policy. In fact, the right policies are unlikely to emerge until a 
critical mass has meaningfully dealt with their Control Factors and share a common perspective. We like to 
look at our history and assume a single perspective throughout but the truth is that we had to learn how to 
respond to Pearl Harbor, the Nazis, the Cold War etc. The same applies here. Our press promotes elites who 
are tasked with acting as if they possess the true wisdom to deal with our threats but the truth is we do not 
know nor are we equipped to marshal enough of our population to agree just yet. The sooner we learn, 
however, the less we will suffer. Mirroring has always been a key component of those lessons. 
I have been encouraged by some recent acts that have begu n to nip at the asymmetry. For years, the language 
of feeling s had been reserved for our enemy while we were limited to that of action; we would do 
terrible acts that would cause bad feelings in the enemy which would then serve to justify whatever response 
it made. It had always been a question of the harsh insensitive acts Westerners do against Muslims and the 
resulting hurt, loss, shame etc. that Muslims experience. The Ground Zero Mosque incident, however, broke 
new ground because all of a sudden non-Muslims' feelings became the focus and were cast as resulting from 
Muslim acts. Another example was seen in how quickly the attempt to blame the Benghazi murders on 
the video about Mohammad fell apart. Just as large corporations eventually learned to turn away from 
shakedown attempts from race baiters, we are beginning to learn to demand symmetry through mirroring. A 
word of caution: When enablers change their behavior and demand symmetrical rules for the addict, the latter 
typically initially erupts with great resistance. This is a stage we must be prepared to tolerate and fully 
withstand as it creates the only real chance for the addict to finally change. It is critical, therefore, that when 
we finally engage in mirroring that we be prepared to see it through completion. 
FP: What if we fail to engage in our own Inner Jihad and the Control Factor stays firmly in place? 
Siegel: Critical to the Inner Jihad is the realization that our civilization is fragile; not to be taken for granted. 
Our demands for multi-culturalism and diversity have bumped heads with the simple paradox that tolerating 
the intolerant leads to extinction. Tolerating the intolerant is perhaps the most crystalline version of 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024414 
asymmetry we have accepted. Seriously engaged Muslims MUST place the Koran above all law while in 
America, the Constitution ranks supreme. As Omar Ahmad, founder of CAIR, reputedly said, Islam isn't in 
Amer ica to be equal to any other faith, but to become dominant. The Koran is the highest authority in 
America and Islam is the only accepted religion on Earth. Who makes law- the people or Allah? While the 
Control Factor constantly seeks for some accommodation between the two, this conflict CAN NOT be 
negotiated. Only one can survive not because we have declared war but because our Islamic Enemy has. 
That is, perhaps, the lesson we will most need to fully learn, one way or another. We will eventually hit a 
Turnaround Moment as a nation and if enough of us are not truly prepared to fight and continue to be 
controlled by our delusions, we will lose. If we truly seek to win, it is better to get there sooner while we have 
advantages than later.

The war being waged has two components - mental and physical. The mental side is a minefield of constructs, 
deeply implanted within generations of Americans, and its PC chickens are coming home to roost. So much 
so, millions of Americans (westerners) cannot break free of its shackles. But it is not as if these mental chains 
magically appe ared. Far from it - http://adinakutnicki.com/2012/11/26/the-death-of-...  
In addition, the fault-lines of democracy allowed for the most retrograde forces, on this planet, to infiltrate 
and penetrate the body politic- http://adinakutnicki.com/2012/09/02/the-subversio...  
IF the mental and physical constraints are not immediately removed, it is a given that western civilization will 
fall. Cause and effect.

And I would think one phy sical constraint is to not let them in in the first place. By & quot;them I mean 
those who have allegiance to a socio-political system disguised as a religion that seeks world dominance by 
man imposed methodology/effort -- unlike Judaism and Christianity properly understood. If we are to 
believe, the world already has a King and does not need a Caliph.

Notice how celebrities basking in their narcissism think they can dictate culture to us while they live their 
lives in the comfort of their ivory castles. Mia farrow has no clue what the right to bear arms means and 
because of that she needs to shut the hell up. As far as blacks go-- I grew up in the 70's coming home from 
Hallahan H.S. in Philadel phia, me and my small group of girls were swarmed by a mob of black girls who 
would kick and slap and pull hair without provocation, of course we would fight back but then that was back 
in the day when whites weren't sissies. Still I made excuses for them. Black men would get in my face for no 
other reason than to intimidate me. rocks were thrown a my car for no reason. So, in short, based on my 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 024416 
experiences Blacks are the cause of racism and if they hate whites so much then they should stay away 
completely and totally.

I read the Control factor and it was excellent. I wish more people would realize that our country is at its most 
vulnerable than ever in its history. the jihadis have basically taken over the inner cities. Islam's love for 
violence coupled with ignorance and narcissim are a recipe for disaster. I hope Americans wake up in time to 
save their future. I'm not optimistic though. I think its over but still I fight on.

SiEESS testing CNY

We stress test China’s FX reserves to capital outflows and warn of a potential
USD520bn fall in FX reserves in 2017, translating into higher CNY volatility.

« We also look at broader EM FX sensitivity to CNY depreciation and find ZAR and
RUB most vulnerable.

« We examine if bond index and MSCI inclusion could significantly offset outflows,
but are doubtful for now.

CNY - anything left in reserve?

We forecast USD/CNY to rise to 7.25 by year-end 2017 based on sustained capital
outflows from China and the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) allowing the exchange rate
to depreciate accordingly. A key change in the PBoC’s new FX regime, announced in
August 2015, is to raise the influence of market forces over the exchange rate.

We showed that not all outflows are created equal. Some outflows are good and reflect
structural changes in China’s economy and liberalization of China’s financial account;
some outflows are ugly in the sense they represent illicit outflows. Yet both types of
outflows are influenced by policy uncertainty in China, which we showed can explain a
significant amount of capital outflows through Chinese purchases of overseas assets.

The impact of capital outflows alone on China’s FX reserves is negative. A decline in FX
reserves is also associated with an increase in volatility of the RMB (Chart 57). But the
negative impact on FX reserves may be offset by China’s trade balance. If China’s trade
balance and capital outflows are similar to that recorded in 2015 and 2016, then China’s
FX reserves would be between USD 2,600bn and USD 2,900bn in 2017. This represents
a fall of USD520-220bn given current FX reserves of USD3,120bn and would amount to
China having diminished control over its currency and higher CNY volatility - assuming
no dramatic changes to capital controls.

for starships, propelled by the imperative for humans
to crawl out of our Earthly cradle. For most of that
time, they focused on the physics. Can we really fly to

know it’s possible. Today, the question is: Will we?
Truth is, we already are flying to the stars, with-
out really meaning to. The twin Voyager space probes
launched in 1977 have endured long past their original
goal of touring the outer planets and have reached
the boundaries of the sun’s realm. Voyager 1 1s 124
astronomical units (AU) away from the sun—that
is, 124 times farther out than Earth—and clocking
3.6 AU per year. Whether it has already exited the
solar system depends on your definition of “solar sys-

and science-fiction writers have devoted their

tem,” but it is certainly way beyond the planets. Its
instruments have witnessed the energetic particles

and magnetic fields of the sun give way to those of
interstellar space—finding, among other things, what
Ralph McNutt, a Voyager team member and planetary
scientist, describes as “weird plasma structures” beg-
ging to be explored. The mysteries encountered by
the Voyagers compel scientists to embark on follow-
up missions that venture even deeper into the cosmic
woods—out to 200 AU and beyond. But what kind of
spacecraft can get us there?

Going Small: Ion Drives

NASA’s Dawn probe to the asteroid belt has demon-
strated one leading propulsion system: the ion drive.
An ion drive is like a gun that fires atoms rather than
bullets; the ship moves forward on the recoil. The sys-
tem includes a tank of propellant, typically xenon, and
a power source, such as solar panels or plutonium bat-
teries. The engine first strips propellant atoms of their
outermost electrons, giving them a positive electric
charge. Then, on the principle that opposites attract,

xxxii The Crooked Course

Territories and Personal Representative to the PLO and the Palestinian Authority at
our new headquarters in Gaza city. The PLO had regained its uncontested leadership,
and the Palestinian Authority received a massive financial boost with the influx of
donor money from across the world. Israel received a moral boost as a large number of
countries formally recognized its existence and established diplomatic relations.

A hallmark of the Declaration of Principles was the establishment of a gradual
approach to resolving the conflict. Gradualism now became the keyword for describing
the peace process. By breaking the overall goal of peace into manageable sections that
could be addressed in sequence, the Oslo process allowed for progress to be made and
trust to develop on less contentious issues before tackling more controversial topics like
Jerusalem, borders, security arrangements, and refugees, which could threaten to derail
any talks.

One of the principal advantages of the step-by-step or gradualist approach was that
it enabled the parties to reach compromises through ongoing dialogue and interaction
with each other by starting with the easiest issues and leaving the hardest for last. It
allowed for an incremental change in perceptions and political positions. Although
gradualism allowed success to be achieved in a variety of areas, moving the process
forward, at each stage, depended on the parties taking the bold steps necessary to fulfill
their respective commitments. The main weakness was slow movement in implemen-
tation, with progress falling behind agreed upon timelines. This led to periodic
disillusionment and back-sliding.

A recurrent problem was that the parties had failed to agree on a mechanism to
penalize non-compliance. This critical deficiency undermined progress. As leaders and
the political climate changed, so too did the resolve to implement.

Successful gradualism required the use of ambiguous language on the most conten-
tious issues: Jerusalem, borders, security, and refugees. The successive Israeli govern-
ments and the Palestinian leadership had substantially different views on the final
status of all four of these issues. The language contained within the Oslo documents, as
well as subsequent agreements, provides room for interpretation. Either side could
claim that the text represents their interests. This allowed leaders to go home to their
respective constituents and retain popular support.

Another practice that proved effective was the use of the annexes attached to agree-
ments to flesh out disruptive details, or to substantially water down the impact of
certain commitments made within the body of the text. In many cases the annexes are
exhaustively long and detailed but are rarely read by the public, affording the leaders
political space to make agreements that might otherwise face public criticism.

The three Israeli Prime Ministers who were in office from 1993 to 1999—Rabin,
Peres, and Netanyahu—approached the challenges of peace through a concept of
gradualism, postponing the tricky final status issues. Barak, who took office in 1999,
was the first Israeli Prime Minister to address the final status head-on with a “totalist”
approach (read below).

While the Oslo process was based on the concept of gradualism, characterized by
bilateral negotiations—facilitated by a third party—and cumulative small steps dem-
onstrating good faith, Ariel Sharon eventually took a contrary approach through
“uncompromising unilateralism”. The day after he won the election in February 2001,

So where does that leave the US payroll and growth picture?

The weakness in the payroll report was almost entirely concentrated in retailing. Net of distortions and seasonal
adjustments, it looks like payroll growth is running at 150-175k per month, and GDP growth is running at a 2.25% trend
pace, both below prior recoveries. While 2.25% is a barn-burner compared to Europe, it only corresponds to a modest
improvement in employment. That’s why 2013 US fiscal policy is so important: this is not a recovery that can
withstand much tighter fiscal conditions.

So, how tight is US fiscal policy supposed to get next year?

Very, if you look at what is supposed to happen according to current law. In the chart, we show the annual change in the
budget deficit over the last 25 years. The impact of all provisions scheduled to expire and kick in during 2013 would be
very large. But if Congress and the President elect to extend current tax rates, retain lower payroll tax rates and extended
jobless benefits, etc, the adjustment would not be as big, and only reflect expiration of Recovery Act provisions, the
recently passed Budget Control Act, and some other smaller provisions. There are of course plenty of permutations in
between.

What direction is the Congress heading, and what did Larry Summers and Brad DeLong have to say about this recently?
Political outcomes this fall will affect what Congress does, but I get the sense that they will punt fiscal adjustments into
the future if they can, and impose austerity of no more than 1% of GDP in 2013. Ifso, Congress can point to a March
2012 paper by Summers and DeLong as justification. The bottom line from the paper: don’t tighten fiscal policy when
interest rates are near zero. The authors assert that (a) additional government spending can ease the long-term budget
constraint in conditions similar to today’s, and (b) tightening policy now would risk permanent loss of human capital,
lower labor productivity growth and lower trend growth. They have held these views for a while; the paper appears
designed to convince others.

Advocates for more fiscal and monetary stimulus often point to the charts below. Rising Federal debt has not resulted in
higher interest rates, so why not keep borrowing more? As for the Fed, balance sheet expansion prevented deflation and

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014776.txt,"Tail risk 4: Bo) triggers curve steepening and vol rise

Bo) keeps yield curve anchored out to 10y: 1y10s20s conditional bear steepener
The Bank of Japan (Bo)) has faced a tough 2016. Having switched its policy target from
quantity to interest rates at its September Monetary Policy Meeting, it tacitly
acknowledged that negative rates and JGB purchases were potentially approaching their
limit in terms of policy effectiveness. Inflation expectations fell and the yen
strengthened as a consequence as the market got accustomed to fading dovish
pronouncements from the Bank of Japan. Bo) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda himself said
“Central banks are, admittedly, not omnipotent.

The Bo) introduced yield curve control, taking into consideration negative effects of
great decline in yields and curve flattening on financial institution earnings or financial
markets. If the Bo) keeps purchasing at the current rate, however, yields will sooner or
later feel downward pressure. We believe the Bo) is likely to reduce its long-term J)GB
purchase gradually. For the time being, JGB yield guidelines are probably around 0% for
the 10yr, 0.4% for the 20yr, and 0.5% for the 30yr JGB.

However, the Bo) appears to be concerned about the deterioration of financial
institution earnings caused by flattening of the yield curve. Kuroda said that even if
superlong-term yields rose slightly, he did not believe they would have to be lowered. He
went on to say he was also giving consideration to investors in superlong-term bonds,
and that he did not think it was good for the yield curve to get continually flatter. Based
on these and other remarks, we expect long-term JGB purchase operations to be
reduced and the curve to gradually steepen (Rates forecast: Attention on Bo) operations

when yields decline).

Before that can happen, however, preconditions most likely include steady progress in
US rate hikes, avoidance of excessive yen appreciation, and some degree of recovery in
the inflation rate. With a Republican clean sweep, US fiscal easing is now a foregone
conclusion and “Higher rates and higher dollar” may support our view for yen rates. If
JGB purchase operations were reduced and yen rates rose in the wake of higher US
Treasury yields and USD/JPY appreciation, that could easily be explained by
fundamentals.

Yen rates volatility is still low; however, purchasing cuts by the Bo) could add to
volatility risk amid declining liquidity in the super long-end (Chart 78). Even if risk-off
sentiment pushes down the yield curve, the Bo) may lower the 10yr JGB yield target
from zero to keep the curve steep. This kind of policy change also could increase
volatility. In either case, the 10yr is expected to be anchored and movement is expected
in the long end. We believe 1y10s20s conditional bear steepener may mitigate this risk.

Trade recommendation: Long S5bn 1y20y @0.62% (atm+11bp) payer vs Short 9.9bn
1y10y @0.18% (atm) payer. This position is zero cost, PVO1 neutral, and zero carry.
Risk Is the curve remains flat due to a deflationary backdrop.

`Blahblahs' forbidden in 'Radical Breakthroughs'. So we need two replacements (for Multiverse as Science 
and Rare Sentience). 
Initial ideas: 
* Expand the first episode Mathematics and Truth into two or likely three episodes. I'm intrigued by this 
because there is so much rich material - pure math, philosophy (discovered or invented), physics (Wigner's 
'unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences)', astrophysics, cosmology, biology, 
general systems theory. I've felt frustrated in this first episode because there is so much material. I think 
three episodes could work - if you agree, I'll get back to you with a suggested structure of the 2 or likely 3 
parts. Also, Closer To Truth has had only a few videos and one episode on mathematics per se (out of 277 
episodes!), so this would be original and complementary. In this may, math would become about half the 
series. 
* Integrated Information Theory - quantifying and explaining consciousness (Giulio Tononi, Un 
of Wisconsin-Madison), plus supporters and critics. New controversial, science-based radical theory. 
* Evolutionary Dynamics - your program at Harvard - mathematical models. This is not an area of my 
expertise, but it could well fit Closer To Truth in general and Radical Breakthroughs in particular. But you 
need to tell me if you would like to include this. 
* Replicability Crisis - Problems in Statistics in Search for Truth. Deep problems of replicability 
in biomedical and especially psychological research - the scandal in recent years. See links and attachments.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012996.txt,"80 4 Brief Survey of Cognitive Architectures

4.5.2 The Society of Mind and the Emotion Machine

In his influential but controversial book The Society of Mind [Min&8], Marvin Minsky described
a model of human intelligence as something that is built up from the interactions of numerous
simple agents. He spells out in great detail how various particular cognitive functions may be
achieved via agents and their interactions. He leaves no room for any central algorithms or
structures of thought, famously arguing: “What magical trick makes us intelligent? The trick
is that there is no trick. The power of intelligence stems from our vast diversity, not from any
single, perfect principle.”

This perspective was extended in the more recent work The Emotion Machine [Min07], where
Minsky argued that emotions are “ways to think” evolved to handle different “problem types”
that exist in the world. The brain is posited to have rule-based mechanisms (selectors) that
turns on emotions to deal with various problems.

Overall, both of these works serve better as works of speculative cognitive science than as
works of AI or cognitive architecture per se. As neurologist Richard Restak said in his review
of Emotion Machine, “Minsky does a marvelous job parsing other complicated mental activities
into simpler elements. ... But he is less effective in relating these emotional functions to what’s
going on in the brain.” As Restak added, he is also not so effective at relating these emotional
functions to straightforwardly implementable algorithms or data structures.

Push Singh, in his PhD thesis and followup work [SBC05], did the best job so far of creating
a concrete AI design based on Minsky’s ideas. While Singh’s system was certainly interesting,
it was also noteworthy for its lack of any learning mechanisms, and its exclusive focus on
explicit rather than implicit knowledge. Due to Singh’s tragic death, his work was never brought
anywhere near completion. It seems fair to say that there has not yet been a serious cognitive
architecture posed based closely on Minsky’s ideas.

4.5.3 DUAL

The closest thing to a Minsky-ish cognitive architecture is probably DUAL, which takes the
Society of Mind concept and adds to it a number of other interesting ideas. DUAL integrates
symbolic and connectionist approaches at a deeper level than CLARION, and has been used
to model various cognitive functions such as perception, analogy and judgment. Computations
in DUAL emerge from the self-organized interaction of many micro-agents, each of which is
a hybrid symbolic/connectionist device. Each DUAL agent plays the role of a neural network
node, with an activation level and activation spreading dynamics; but also plays the role of
a symbol, manipulated using formal rules. The agents exchange messages and activation via
links that can be learned and modified, and they form coalitions which collectively represent
concepts, episodes, and facts.

The structure of the model is sketchily depicted in Figure 4.10, which covers the application
of DUAL to a toy environment called TextWorld. The visual input corresponding to a stim-
ulus is presented on a two-dimensional visual array representing the front end of the system.
Perceptual primitives like blobs and terminations are immediately generated by cheap parallel
computations. Attention is controlled at each time by an object which allocates it selectively
to some area of the stimulus. A detailed symbolic representation is constructed for this area
which tends to fade away as attention is withdrawn from it and allocated to another one. Cate-

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016161.txt,"Health: Not Tremendously Prescriptive

Vision 2030 a start but Needs Transparent Proposals

The Saudi government’s Vision 2030 document calls for an improvement in healthcare
in Saudi Arabia. The private healthcare sector has some role to play; the National
Transformation Plan (NTP) targets the private sector to be responsible for funding 35%
of healthcare spend in 2020, up from 25% today. How it intends to do this is uncertain.
We believe the incumbent private hospital operators, including listed companies (Al
Hammadi, Care, Dallah, MEAHCO and Mouwasat) should be beneficiaries of increased
private sector funding, although increased investment would be needed to meet growth
in demand longer-term.

Improve public facilities, work towards privatisation

The government wants to step back from financing and providing healthcare and adopt
an oversight and regulatory role. Firstly the government wants to improve the quality of
care offered in the public sector, with the eventual aim of working towards privatisation
of public assets and healthcare provision. This implies no privatisations short-term.

Near-term: Management contracts for public hospitals

In the near-term the government could seek to improve healthcare provision in the
public system by using private sector expertise, through, e.g. contracting management
of public facilities to the private sector. Individual such contracts are unlikely to
transform company earnings, and the small size of existing Saudi hospital groups limits
the depth of management available to capture large contracts, in our view.

Long-term: insurance coverage up to 31m from 10.5m

In the long-term a widespread adoption of private health insurance is likely to raise
volumes, spurring an increase in private healthcare capacity, either from organic
investment or participation in privatisations. In Saudi currently, 10.5m/31m people have
insurance. We assume a more universal scheme would offer lower pricing than that
today, and listed incumbents would need to make a cultural shift towards addressing
this market. Such a market could attract new competitors, domestic or foreign.

Type of insurance system and reimbursement uncertain

We believe reimbursement levels would need to be known before privatisations can
occur so bidders can budget and estimate their return on capital. It is still uncertain
whether the government would seek to introduce insurance through the incumbent
private operators (Bupa Arabia, Medgulf and Tawuniya) or set up its own insurance
company e.g. an Abu Dhabi-style Daman. Nor whether it would subsidise premiums or
simply force the private sector to employ more Saudis.

Government needs to improve private sector relations

At present the government has not paid private hospitals for the treatment of public
patients referred to them for over a year. Until the relationship improves, engaging with
the private sector could be difficult.

Healthcare implications of National Transformation Plan

The Saudi government’s Vision 2030 document calls for an improvement in healthcare
in Saudi Arabia. The private healthcare sector is likely to be a beneficiary both in the
short-term and long-term. In the short-term the National Transformation Plan (NTP)
targets the private sector to be responsible for funding 35% of healthcare spend in
2020, up from 25% today. In the longer-term, the Saudi government wants to remove
itself from directly providing and financing healthcare, instead focussing on public
health and the regulation of the healthcare sector. Raising private sector funding
thresholds to 35% appears possible if a number of measures are used, e.g. more
rigorous enforcement of requirement that Saudis working in private sector hold
insurance could increase penetration by 6% alone. The quality targets set for the public
sector do not appear unduly onerous in theory, but execution remains key.

When faced with a build-up of Iraqi
forces along its border, Kuwait decided
not to mobilize its military out of fear
that the move would provoke Saddam
Hussein. The incentives for Gulf states to
make similar strategic calculations in the
future will be greater when Iran has an
inventory of nuclear weapons to match its
growing ballistic missile capabilities.

The Gulf states, moreover, will likely
reason that the U.S. capability to threaten
or use force against a nuclear Iran will be
significantly diminished. Even without
nuclear weapons, Gulf states have seen,
in their view, a long history of American
reluctance to threaten or use force against
Iran. For example, the United States took
no direct military action against Iran after
it aided and abetted Hezbollah bombings
against Americans in Lebanon in the
1980s, after Iran supported the bombing
of Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia in
1996, or even after Iran supported the
deadly campaign of improvised explosive
devices (IEDs) against U.S. troops in
Iraq. Gulf states will no doubt judge that
if the United States was unable and
unwilling to attack Tehran under these
circumstances, then it is certainly not
going to attack Iran in the future, when it
will be able to retaliate with nuclear
weapons.

negotiations. The first stirrings of discontent had begun even before I went to see
Clinton. On the basis of my commitment merely to try for peace, Arik Sharon had
presented a no-confidence motion in the Knesset. It was never going to pass. But
only days after I’d made him Interior Minister, Natan Sharansky let it be known he
was going to vote against us. He didn’t. He stayed away from the chamber, in
effect abstaining. But I’d been put on notice.

I did lose my first coalition partner in September: the small United Torah
Judaism party, with five Knesset seats. It wasn’t over land-for-peace. In an echo of
a similar crisis that brought down the government during Rabin’s first spell as
Prime Minister in the 1970s, it was over a violation of the Jewish Sabbath. It
turned out that Israel’s state electric company had been transporting a huge steam-
condensation machine from the manufacturing site near Haifa to a power plant in
Ashdod. The unit was the size of a small apartment. It weighed 100 tons. It
couldn’t be driven across the country without bringing weekday traffic to a
standstill. The obvious solution was to do it when road use was lightest, on
Shabbat. Precisely the same procedure had been followed — 24 times — under Bibi.
But when I asked a United Torah Judaism leader why he’d seemed happy when
Likud had waved it through, he replied: “Past sins cannot pardon future ones.” Eli
Suissa, one of the Shas ministers in the cabinet, took his side, saying: “Every hour
is good for the keeping of Shabbat.” Most other ministers agreed with me that we
should stand firm. So I did. But UTJ walked out of the government. Shas did
remain. But I was now increasingly certain that at some stage its ministers, too,
would leave.

In the midst of the Sharanksy rebellion, Haim Ramon, who was the minister in
charge of liaising with the Knesset, insisted I “punish” him for his political
grandstanding. “You should fire Sharansky. Act like a leader!” I just laughed. ‘““The
coalition doesn’t need a leader,” I replied. “It needs therapy.” In truth, I suspected
that if we ever got near to a peace agreement with Assad or Arafat, even therapy
might not help. But that was a main reason that I’d promised a referendum on any
final peace deals. I believed that in the choice between concessions, even painful
ones, and a genuine peace deal with Syria or the Palestinians, by far most Israelis
would choose peace.

I relied on a strong, close team around me, people I knew well and who shared
my determination to stay focused on the central goal: to put Israel in a position
where its citizens could be given that choice. I made Danny Yatom, my former

Soviet republics, few of whom spoke English, were recruited for Esptein's sexual pleasure.
According to a former bookkeeper, a number of the girls worked for MC2, the modeling agency
owned by Jean Luc Brunel, a longtime acquaintance and frequent guest of Epstein's.

Brunel, along with numerous young models, was a frequent passenger on Epstein's private jet,
according to flight manifests. The agency owner also allegedly received $1 million from Epstein
in 2005, when he founded MC2 with his partner, Jeffrey Fuller; although Fuller and Brunel
denied any such payment from the billionaire pervert in 2007, when rumors started swirling,
Samoff got confirmation from a former bookkeeper at the agency. Whether the money was a
secret investment in MC2, or a payment for Brunel's services as a procurer, is unknown. Brunel

also visited Epstein in jail.

So who is Jean Luc Brunel? Although he did not respond to our interview request, we spoke to a
number of people who have worked with his agency. While MC2 isn't considered a major
industry player, it isn't exactly bottom-shelf, either: MC2 in New York most recently launched
the career of Latvian editorial star Ginta Lapina (Brunel discovered Lapina via an MC2
scouting competition for young teens) and currently represents Vogue China covergirl Liu Dan.
Worldwide, MC2 represents such stars as Sessilee Lopez in Miami, and top models Candace

Swanepoel, Marina Lynchuk, Natalia Chabanenko, and Elisa Sednaoui in Tel Aviv.

Brunel isn't involved with the business on a day-to-day basis, although he owns an 85% stake in
MC2. Instead, Right now he does scouting for [the] agency and takes care of the international
relations with other agencies,” reports one source. Scouts scour the world for un-agented
teenaged girls who could make it as models; they work largely unsupervised and are generally
paid a headhunting fee for every girl an agency signs. Even when affiliated with an agency, as
Brunel obviously is with MC2, scouts operate mostly independently and with little oversight —
even relative to the almost totally unregulated modeling industry itself. He travels a lot, says
another person who has worked with Brunel. (The company blog refers to Brunel as a scouting
tsunami, and MC2 is fairly well-known for the strength of its international scouting.)

Models we spoke to report mostly positive experiences with Brunel — one praised his sense of
humor and said he is “lovely to all of his models, and another described him as highly
intelligent and cultured, adding, he knows a lot about the opera and he paints — although it
should be noted that none of the models whom we spoke to had been told of either his
connections with Epstein, or his past.

And what a past it is. These accounts from Michael Gross' 1995 book Model describe Brunel's
activities in Paris from the late 1970s onwards, when he worked for, and eventually owned, the

modeling agency Karins, now known as Karin Paris:

“Jean-Luc is considered a danger, says Jér6me Bonnouvrier. Owning Karins was a dream for a
playboy. His problem is that he knows exactly what girls in trouble are looking for. He's always

Edwards Files Civil Suits Against Epstein

44. Edwards had a good faith belief that his clients felt angry and betrayed by the
criminal system and wished to prosecute and punish Epstein for his crimes against them in
whatever avenue remained open to them. On August 12, 2008, at the request of his client Jane
Doe, Brad Edwards filed a civil suit against Jeffrey Epstein to recover damages for his sexual
assault of Jane Doe. See Edwards Affidavit, “N” at J7. Included in this complaint was a RICO
count that explained how Epstein ran a criminal conspiracy to procure young girls for him to
sexually abuse. See Complaint, Jane Doe v. Epstein (Exhibit “T’’).

45. On September 11, 2008, at the request of his client E.W., Brad Edwards filed a civil
auth against Jeffrey Epstein to recover damages for his sexual assault of E.W. See Complaint,

E.W. v. Epstein (Exhibit “U”).

his life in very positive ways and I don't believe in blanket condemnations of people. He served time for
something that was determined was inappropriate. I honestly don't know who was the victim in this case. I
fully expect that these masseuses knew what they were doing, and were not swayed to do anything with
Jeffrey that they were not already doing. That is not to approve of the whole behavior, but lots of peoplel

Kushner’s response to his foreign ministry in Moscow. It is inconceivable that Kislyak did not
know that the call would be monitored by the FBI, since the FBI had routinely listened in on these
lines for the past 68 years, or that his discussion of Kushner’s request would set off alarm bells in
the intelligence community.

If Kislyak had wanted to hide this exchange from U.S. intelligence, he could have easily sent it
under diplomatic cover directly to Moscow, used a secure line, or relayed it in a coded fashion. By
communicating the message en clair, or in plaintext, Kislyak skillfully exposed Kushner’s
incredibly stupid response, which he himself had provoked, to stoke distrust about the incoming
president within the U.S. intelligence community. Nor was this the only mistrust Kislyak
cultivated: the conversations on the monitored phone led to the firing of National Security Advisor
Michael Flynn, and conversations that Kislyak had with Attorney General Jeff Sessions led to
Sessions’s recusing himself from the Russian investigation, which has now driven a wedge between
President Trump and one of his most effective and popular cabinet members.

Kislyak’s resume indicates that he is a well-regarded and competent player in the game of nations:
he has served as Second Secretary of the Soviet UN mission in New York, First Secretary of the
Soviet Embassy in Washington, Deputy Director of the Soviet Department of International
Organizations in Moscow, Permanent Russian representative to NATO in Brussels, Deputy Foreign
Minister, and Ambassador to the United States. Nothing in his 37-year career, either during or after
the Cold War, suggests that his moves are not aligned with Kremlin strategy.

But when it comes to the various disclosures and interventions surrounding the 2016 election, what
exactly was that strategy?

In a report issued on January 6, 2017, entitled “Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in
Recent U.S. Elections,” the U.S. intelligence community concluded, based both on its sources and
its analysis of stories on the Russian-controlled network RT, that Putin wanted to hurt Clinton, help
Trump, and discredit the American election. These may well have been motives of the Russian
president, but the narrowly focused assessment fails to explain, or even take into account, Kislyak’s
post-election ensnarement of Kushner, or the discrediting dirt against Trump. If Putin had really
wanted to help Trump win the election, why did Russian sources provide damaging dirt to Steele,
which could have cost Trump the election? Why did Kislyak provide the FBI with information, via
a known tapped line, that could (and did) compromise key members of Trump’s administration?

A wider focus can be found, of all places, in Oliver Stone’s revealing, if fawning, four-hour
interview with Putin, in which the Russian dictator makes clear that he views American hegemony,
including America’s standing and respect in the international community, as a threat that Russia
must counter. One way to undermine America’s standing is to provide disclosures that can be used
by its own political factions, and the media, to sow distrust in America’s reliability as a democracy
founded on transparency. Putin tells the truth when he says that it doesn’t matter particularly to
Russia whether Clinton or Trump won the election: his goal was to install doubt in the legitimacy
of the process, regardless of how it turned out.

Edward Jay Epstein’s most recent book is How America Lost Its Secrets: Edward
Snowden, the Man and the Theft, published by Alfred A. Knopf in January.

European Landscape

European Parliament Resolution

In February 2019, the European Parliament passed a significant resolution to create
harmonized policies and standardized practices for medical cannabis products in the EV.
The Parliament stressed the importance of conducting clinical trials, which requires a
formal assessment of socio-economic and regulatory barriers that have prohibited
access to research in the past. This is not a legislative, binding resolution; the European
Commission will need to consider a regulatory framework that permits access and
availability to cannabis medicine, therapies and scientific studies.

The European Parliament explicitly stated support for the WHO's recommendations to
institutionalize the medical and scientific uses of cannabis. Having these two
international institutions aligned on standardizing medical cannabis policies will
facilitate support for interstate agreements and trade, and paves way for rapid
legislative change and growth.

EU Standards And Regulations

There is not a supranational regulatory framework for cannabis in the EU. However,
general standards, such as Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), Good Agricultural and
Collection Practice and Good Distribution Practice, are now significant for cannabis
compliance. Licenses and authorization must be obtained for certification. This is
especially required for pharmaceutical grade cannabis, which is why many Canadian LPs
can export to Europe and made investments to build GMP-certified facilities. Although
not necessary for non-prescribed cannabis, products with GMP-certification have
trusted quality recognition across the EU.

In the EU, the legal limit for THC content is less than 0.2%, in comparison to North
America where it is less than 0.3% THC. There are some disparities across the continent
with higher margins in Italy (up to 0.6%) and various import requirements country to
country. Outside of the EU, Switzerland permits up to 1% THC content, which is treated
as a tobacco substitute.

EU Novel Food

Recently, CBD has been added to the European Union's (EU) Novel Food Catalogue.
Foodstuff may be supplements, ingredients or other substance forms. A “novel” food is a
product not previously consumed in the EU, to a significant degree, prior to May 15,
1997, such as for example, foods that enter the market through new technology or
agricultural products normally consumed and grown outside of the EU (e.g. chia seeds,

Amendments to the Catalogue occur frequently and provide a regulatory framework for
EU Member States (MS) to follow. Some MS (i.e. UK, France, Germany, Italy, and
Holland) requested to update the catalogue with CBD and hemp-derived products. The
European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is now conducting a risk assessment for CBD.
This categorization includes pure CBD extracts and products that contain CBD extracts.
The EFSA’s assessment is limited to a daily intake of 130 milligrams. The outcome of the

Accountability must mean to voters, I assume, that teachers will
be measured by how well they teach their students. Political candi-
dates, always willing to hop on an uncontroversial point of view, are
all quite certain that the voters know what they are talking about. No
matter how stupid NCLB is, no matter how mean spirited, no matter
how awful for both teachers and students, its very horror rests on the
premise that no one seems to be disputing that the federal govern-
ment has the right to tell the schools what to teach and to see whether
they are indeed teaching it.

How is this premise wrong?

e It assumes that all schools should teach the same
subjects.

e It assumes that some subjects are more important than
other subjects.

e It assumes that all important subjects can be easily tested.

e It assumes that seeing who did better than whom in
school is an intrinsic part of the educational process.

e It assumes that all children have the same educational
needs,

Let’s take them one by one.

ALL SCHOOLS SHOULD TEACH THE SAME SUBJECTS

Why is this wrong?

First, it is wrong because subjects aren’t what should be taught.
But even if one follows the view presented in this book that the issue
is cognitive processes and not subjects, cognitive processes need to be
applied to actual domains, that are relevant to the life of the student..
Kids in New York come from, and will live in, a different world than
their compatriots in New Mexico. In New Mexico, I was asked whether
we could teach casino management and land use. Yes, we could, but
not if there is federal accountability about algebra and 20 other sub-
jects that make it impossible to fit these subjects in.

Good News: Mathematical Illustrations to Fix Social Security’s

Financial Problems Do Not Seem Drastic

In fact, when Social Security was nearing bankruptcy in 1983, a
combination of moderate reforms led to 25 consecutive years of
operating surpluses.

Highlights of 1983 Social Security Reform
1) Raised full retirement age to 67 by 2027 (from 65)*
2) Reduced annual benefits by 5% (via a 6-month delay in cost-of-living

adjustment in 1983 & subsequent changes in benefit formulas and tax
schemes) .

3) Raised Social Security tax rates by 2.3% (via an advancement in
scheduled tax increase).

4) Made Social Security benefits (up to 50%) taxable income.

Note: *For people born in 1937 or earlier, full retirement age (with 100% Social Security benefit) remained at 65. For people
born after 1960, full retirement age was raised to 67. For people born between 1937 and 1960, the full retirement age
progressively increases from 65 to 67. Source: Social Security Administration archive.

By November, even his Foreign Minister, David Levy, was making noises
about quitting. He said it would be a waste of time to stay in the cabinet if it was
going to bring the peace process to a halt. I warned Bibi, both in the Knesset and in
a series of speeches, about the alternative on the Palestinian side if those who
wanted a negotiated peace had nothing but stalemate to show for it. And lives, I
insisted, were at stake. Both through closed-door sessions of the Knesset’s security
and foreign affairs committee, and my own contacts in military intelligence, I was
convinced that the result would be a second, much more deadly, intifada. Not with
Molotov cocktails, but guns, and suicide bombs.

I was not out to score political points in keeping the pressure on Bibi to move
forward. In fact, I announced that if Bibi did go ahead and finalize the terms for
our Oslo redeployment, Labor would once again provide the extra Knesset votes
needed for him to get it approved.

Early in 1998, he sent word that he wanted to talk. The message came through
Yaakov Ne’eman, his Finance Minister and a prominent lawyer whom I knew and
liked. He and I held an exploratory meeting at which he proposed talks with Bibi
on the prospect of a unity government that would help move the peace process
forward. I said I’d talk, with one proviso: the discussions would be genuinely
secret, with no leaks. I was not prepared to engage in political gamesmanship. In
May, Bibi sent an assurance of confidentiality through Ne’eman. The first of about
a half-dozen meetings came a few days later at the Prime Minister’s residence in
Jerusalem. Then, we shifted venue, meeting at a Mossad-owned villa north of Tel
Aviv. I brought along Bougie Herzog, a bright young lawyer, and Labor Party
member, who was working in the same law firm and Ne’eman. It was by no means
clear we’d agree on a unity government. To my amusement, if not altogether to my
surprise, I got word that Bibi was putting out separate political feelers to Shimon
Peres. But before long, it became clear there was a specific political motivation
behind his approaching me. It was indeed the peace process. But it wasn’t the
Palestinian peace process, something Bibi still clearly wanted to avoid as much as
humanly possible. It was an attempt to engage with Syria.

He asked me about the talks under Rabin and Peres, and my views on the
possibility of a deal with President Assad. He also wanted my assessment about
whether the army could work out arrangements to safeguard the country’s security
if we handed back most, if not all, of the Golan Heights. If so, what kind of
security arrangements, with what timeline? We met through the summer, as the

The first day of rehearsal for “Macbeth,” Alec Baldwin sat down next to me. “Who do you play?” he asked. My
voice quivered: “Ummm, I play Fleance and Young Seward.” He paused. “Oh — so I kill you twice.” Each
night, as he drove his broadsword through my heart, I thought, “I’ve made it!”

In the sixth season of “Scrubs,” the show’s creator, Bill Lawrence (also a major fan of musical comedy),
decided to do a musical episode. It was the first time I had done musical comedy since I was at camp, and it
instantly reminded me how much I loved it. My favorite song from the episode was called “Guy Love.” In it,
Donald Faison (my best friend in real life and on the show) and I sang about how our homoerotic love for each
other was nothing to apologize for. (“It’s guy love, that’s all it is.””) The experience replanted the seed, and I
made a promise to myself: One day I would sing on Broadway.

I’d be curled in the fetal position spooning a pillow right now, though, if it weren’t for my current director,
Susan Stroman. Directing and choreographing a musical is the most epic undertaking for one human being, yet
Susan (or Stro, as the cool Broadway kids call her) handles it with aplomb.

And she’s not just choreographing the actors and dancers, but also the magnificent set designed by Santo
Loquasto, which moves in ways I didn’t know scenery could move. It’s a dance of men and women and
machines and winches and elevators and lights. The wings of the St. James are very narrow, so when a giant
piece of scenery disappears from the audience’s view, the most elaborate game of Tetris begins, as the
outstanding stage crew turns and lifts and twists; not an inch is wasted. The second the orchestra strikes the first
note of the overture, no one stops moving until the final curtain hits the deck.

During “Manhattan Murder Mystery,” I had every word of my lines memorized down to the punctuation mark.
I’ll never forget: The first thing Woody said to me was, “We’re probably not going to say exactly what’s on the
page so ... you know ... just try to keep up. ...”” While we’ve been in previews on “Bullets,” he and Stro have
been giving us notes each day on the previous night’s performance. One night, I dropped a great joke by
accident. He said to me with a smile, “You’ll probably get a bigger laugh if you actually say it onstage.”

All the people on Broadway are the best at what they do. All dancers want to work with Stro, so she gets the
best dancers in New York City. Is there an oboist in the orchestra? You can guarantee he’s the best oboist on the
island of Manhattan. Need to recreate the look of 1929? The six-time Tony winner William Ivey Long is here to
design the costumes. And the voices! I am in awe. There has yet to be a time when I don’t get goose bumps
when Betsy Wolfe, who plays my girlfriend, belts out the final notes of our duet, “I Found a New Baby.”

growth theory holds again. Who knows? Meanwhile, | think, the case is closed. All

growth at very large scales is free until proved otherwise.

Where Does Opinion Stand Now?

What should we make of this evidence for free growth in national accounts and
stock market data? Lawmakers would probably demand a recount or an
investigation. Tax laws discourage consumption and dividends to encourage growth.
Yet data show that lower consumption rate coincides as often with lower as higher
capital growth rate for eight nations over four to fourteen decades. They will show

the same for dividends when we come to that.

Economists would be less surprised. Solow has prepared them for the news. In 1956
and 1957 he showed evidence that most growth is not explained by capital
accumulation, or saving through consumption restraint. His Nobel prize acceptance

speech in 1988 includes:

... In the beginning, I was quite surprised at the relatively minor part the model
ascribed to capital formation. Even when this was confirmed by Denison and others,
the result seemed contrary to common sense. The fact that the steady-state rate of
growth is independent of the investment quota was easy to understand; it only
required thinking through the theory. It was harder to feel comfortable with the
conclusion that even in the shorter run increased investment would do very little for
transitory growth. The transition to a higher equilibrium growth path seemed to

offer very little leverage for policy aimed at promoting investment.

The formal model omitted one mechanism whose absence would clearly bias the
predictions against investment. That is what I called “embodiment,” the fact that
much technological progress, maybe most of it, could find its way into actual
production only with the use of new and different capital equipment. Therefore the

effectiveness of innovation in increasing output would be paced by the rate of gross

CHAPTER SIXTEEN

The Question of When?

“The NSA was actually concerned back in the time of the crypto-wars with improving American security.
Nowadays, we see that their priority is weakening our security”

—Snowden in Moscow

In his 1974 novel Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, John LeCarre helped establish the concept in the
public imagination of a mole burrowing unto a rival intelligence service. LeCarre’s now classic
mole, code-named by the KGB “Gerald,” managed in the novel to gain access to the inner
sanctum of the British intelligence service MI-6. Aided and guided by his controllers in Moscow,
he systematically stole British intelligence secrets. As LeCarre wove the plot, the brilliantly-
orchestrated operation involved spotting, compromising, and recruiting others to gradually
advance Gerald the mole to a position of power. Such well-organized penetrations are not limited
to fiction. The career of KGB mole Heinz Felfe, who was advanced through the ranks of
German intelligence by an elaborate series of sacrifices by his controllers in Moscow until he
actually headed German counterintelligence in 1961, could have served as the non-fiction
inspiration for Le Carre’s 1963 novel Zhe Spy Who Came out of the Cold. As US intelligence
only found out after the Cold War ended, the KGB also had the ability to sustain moles for
decades.

The CIA also had its share of long term successes, such as Alexander Poteyev, who fed the CIA
secrets for over ten years while burrowing into Russian intelligence. In the choreography of
these operations, as in Le Carre’s fiction, rival intelligence services ensnared and sacrificed
recruits , as if playing a chess game, to advance their moles. Despite notable successes such as
Felfe, and Poteyev, a great number of these elaborate conspiracies fail insinuate moles in their
adversaries’ confidence. Intelligence services therefore also take advantage of a more prosaic
source: the self-generated spy, or, as they are called in the trade, walk-in.

Although they are largely unsung in novels, these walk-ins are an important part of
espionage. A counterespionage review done for the Presidential Foreign Intelligence Advisory
Board (PFIEB) in 1990 found that most US spies in the Cold War had taken documents on their
own volition and only afterwards offered them to an adversary service. Self-generated spies have
diverse motives. Some intelligence workers steal secrets for financial gains. Others take them to
further an ideological interest. As opportunistic enterprises, intelligence services do not turn walk-
ins away if they have valuable intelligence. Indeed, some of the most successful moles were not
recruited, or even controlled, by spy agencies. They were self-generated penetrations, or
“sources” as the KGB preferred to call them, who first stole secrets and later voluntarily deliver
them to an adversary. Consider the case of Robert Hanssen, who successfully penetrated the FBI

Frack ’er Up

Natural gas is shaking up the search for green gasoline

BY DAVID BIELLO

AM SPEEDING DOWN New Jersey’s highways,
| propelled by gasoline with a dash of ethanol, an

alcoholic biofuel brewed from stewed corn ker-
~~ nels. As I drive through the outskirts of the town-
ship of Hillsborough, in the center of the state, I see
that spring has brought with rt a bounty of similar “bio-
mass,” as the fuel industry likes to call plants. Trees
line the road and fresh-cut grass covers the sidewalks
as I pull into the business park that is home to Pri-
mus Green Energy—a company that has been touting
a technology to transform such biomass into a green
and renewable form of gasoline.

But there’s a hitch. The boom in hydraulic fracturing,
or “fracking,” a technique in which horizontal drilling
and high-pressure jets of water are deployed to release
gas trapped in sedimentary shale rock, has made natu-
ral gas cheap and plentiful. That’s not bad for Primus,
whose technology can make gasoline from natural gas,
biomass, or even low-grade coal, such as lignite or peat.
This versatility makes Primus a potential part of what

has been called the “olive economy’—companies that
are neither bright green nor darkest black, but com-
bine environmentally-friendlier technologies with old-
er and dirtier ones in order to compete. In fact, Primus
may become a leader in advancing this kind of technol-
ogy. “We can be as dark as you want or as green as you
want,” says geologist, serial entrepreneur, and Primus
salesman George Boyajian.

In July, President Barack Obama gave a major
speech on climate change that described natural gas
as a “transition fuel” towards the “even cleaner energy
economy of the future.” But Primus’s trajectory raises
the question of whether natural gas is a boost on the
road to a genuinely green fuel, or if it is prolonging our
addiction to dirty modes of transport, and taking us on
a detour from a low-carbon path.

At the Primus headquarters, I first meet Primus’s
chief chemist Howard Fang in front of a prototype of
a Primus conversion machine. Fang, who joined the
company for what he calls his “semi-retirement,” is

value of $4.83bn less $300mn for potential revisions.

Downside risks to our PO are: 1} Alibaba stock valuation declines, 2) Alibaba valuation
discount is higher than expected, 3) Verizon's pending acquisition of Yahoo core assets
is delayed/challenged, 4} valuation of Yahoo! Japan falls, and 5) valuation of Excalibur
patent portfolio falls.

Yelp (YELP)

Our $43 price objective is based on 14x 2018E EV/EBITDA, slightly above online media
comps, which we believe is warranted given the higher margin potential in the model.
We believe our multiple balances premium growth vs peers with medium-term concerns
on competition and limited GAAP profitability. We believe the slight premium valuation
is sustainable if the company can continue to deliver 25% y/y topline growth with y/y
margin improvement.

Downside risks are Google and Facebook's ambitions to build a review ecosystem to tap
into local ad spending, competition from a variety of online and offline locally focused
advertising businesses, Google traffic dependency, and advertiser churn.

Zillow (ZG / Z)

Our $42 price objective is based on a 6x our 2018E EV/Sales and supported by our DCF
valuation. Our multiple is roughly in-line for online real estate lead generation sites in
other countries operating in developed countries. In addition, this multiple represents a
relative discount given Zillow's higher sales growth and a larger US TAM in comparison
to its peers in smaller developed markets like Australia and Japan. We are positive on
Zillow's long term opportunity to capture the majority of realtor's dollars moving from
offline channels to online marketing channels.

Downside risks are: 1) traffic cannibalization between Zillow properties, 2) new lawsuits
again Zillow, 3) potential for multiple compression, 4) a U.S. housing market down turn,
and 5) lack of profitability support for valuation.

Upside risks are: 1) faster than expected growth and S&M leverage, 2) Zillow Digg
monetization, 3) accelerated grow the in rentals market, and 4) new market expansion.

ZYNGA (ZNGA)

Our $2.70 PO is now based on 11x 2018E EBITDA (which is a premium to the Mobile
gaming peer group due to margin expansion potential), plus $1.41/share in cash and
assets (building).

Downside risks to our price objective are mobile market share losses, challenges in
establishing successful new content given employee departures, and player churn due to
greater competition given low barriers to entry. Upside risks are successful new title
releases that accelerate growth, or potential acquisition of Zynga for its game portfolio.

development during a dramatic century of world, American, and Jewish history, enriched with
anecdotes and behind-the-scenes stories from my life and the lives of those I have encountered.

An autobiographer is like a defendant who takes the stand at his own trial. We all have the right
to remain silent, both in life and in law. But if one elects to bear witness about his own life, then
he or she must tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. This commitment to
complete candor is subject only to limited privileges such as those between a lawyer and a client,
or a husband and a wife. A witness may be questioned not only about his actions, but also about
his motivations, his feelings, his biases, and his regrets. In this autobiography, I intend to comply
with these rules to the best of my ability.

Why then have I waived my privilege of silence and decided to write this autobiography: because
I have lived the passion of my times and participated in some of the most transforming, legal and
political events of the past half century. In this autobiography, I will describe and explain my role
in litigating cases and advocating causes that have changed the political and legal landscape—for
better or worse. I will also explain how I litigate difficult cases—the tactics and strategies I have
successfully developed over the years. My oath of honesty makes it impossible to hide behind the
false modesty that often denies the readers of autobiographies an accurate picture of the impact an
author has had on events.

Since you’re reading these words, you’ve probably encountered the public Alan
Dershowitz—confrontational, unapologetic, brash, tough, argumentative, and uncompromising.
Those who know me well—family, friends, and colleagues—hardly recognize the “character” I
play on TV [alternative: my TV persona]. They tell me in my personal life, I shy away from
confrontation and am something of a pushover. My son Elon says that when people bring me up
in conversation, he can instantly tell whether they know me from TV or from personal
interactions—whether they know what he calls “The Dersh Character” or “the real Alan.”

This sharp dichotomy between my public and private personas was brought home to me quite
dramatically, when a major motion picture, Reversal of Fortune, was made about my role in the
Claus Von Bulow case, and a character, based on me, was played by Tony Award actor Ron
Silver. The New York Times asked me to write an article for the arts and entertainment section
on how it feels to watch someone play you on the big screen.

The opening scene of the film had my character playing an energetic basketball game with
himself—true enough. But when he’s interrupted by a phone call giving him the news that he had
lost a case involving two brothers on death row (the Tison brothers, see Chapter 12), he smashes
the phone on the pavement.

programs to study “exceptional responders”: those rare
cancer patients who do well while nobody else does.

Cancer is a personal disease, Solit explains. Each
tumor constitutes its own world of defective genes and
proteins. By studying the genetic quirks of exception-
al responders, physicians can systematically identify
weaknesses in cancer subtypes and blast them with
drugs that target their unique vulnerabilities. “It’s a
testament to how much has been learned about the
genome in the past 30 years,” Solit says. “We’ ve always
wanted to find out why some individuals respond so
well. Now we have the capacity. It’s going to really
change the way we treat patients.”

UNLIKELY CASES HAVE AN eminent history in medi-
cine. The modern science of the mind owes a lot to

the freakish accident suffered by Phineas Gage, a

19th century railroad construction foreman whose

job involved packing down explosive powder with a

three-and-a-half-foot-long iron tamping rod. On Sept.
13, 1848, the powder exploded in his face, blasting the
rod up through his chin and out the back of his head.
Against all odds, he survived. But his personality was
transformed. The formerly shrewd and patient Gage

became obnoxious and unreliable.

An observant doctor named John Martyn Harlow
who cared for Gage proposed that his personality
change was due to the destruction of the frontal lobe
of the left side of the brain. Gage’s unlikely transfor-
mation revealed a universal truth about brains, that
particular parts—the frontal lobes—are required for
self-control. The strange case of Phineas Gage is still
mentioned in neuroscience textbooks.

Rare events can also lead to new cures. As the story
goes, English physician Edward Jenner’s observations
of an 18th century milkmaid who caught cowpox and
thereby became immune to smallpox paved the way for
the fi vaccines. New ideas for curing HIV are emerg-
ing from the famously unlucky lucky case of the “Berlin
patient.” Timothy Ray Brown, who was HIV positive,
developed blood cancer leukemia in 2006. His chemo-
therapy and radiation treatments wiped out the cells
of his immune system, where the virus is believed to
hide. He then got a bone marrow transplant from one
of those rare people with a gene mutation that makes
them resistant to HIV. Today, Brown still has no sign

37

of HIV in his body, and his case has inspired a study
to genetically engineer HIV-positive patients’ cells to
resist the virus.

In the past, cancer researchers weren’t able to
capitalize on their unexpected outlier successes. Not
enough was known about the biology of cancer, and
the right tools hadn’t been invented. “Even if someone
had a complete remission, you had no way to figure out
why,” says James Doroshow, director of the Division of
Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis of the National Can-
cer Institute (NCI). That changed in the 2000s, when
it became possible to analyze the genetics of cancer
tumors for clues.

The first major success came with studies of the
drug gefitinib in non-small-cell lung cancer (the most
common kind). Gefitinib helped less than 20 percent
of the people who took it, but a few outliers had dra-
matic, rapid recoveries. In 2004, two Harvard groups
found that the responders had mutations in the epi-
dermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. EGFR 1s
one of many genes that regulates how cells grow and
when they die, and the mutation basically forced it to
pump out two or three times as much growth signal as
it should, fueling the cancer. Gefitinib dialed down the
signal. A clinical trial later proved that the drug keeps
tumors at bay for more than nine months in people
with certain EGFR mutations.

More insights gleaned from extraordinary respond-
ers soon followed. One melanoma patient in a study of
22 people taking sorafenib saw his tumor shrink quick-
ly, a response due to a mutation in the gene KIT, which
regulates cell growth, division and survival. People
with certain kinds of melanoma, such as the type that
grows on mucus membranes, now routinely get tested
for this mutation. The drug helps about 40 percent of
those with the mutation—an impressive advance in a
cancer that once had no effective treatment.

In these studies, investigators had to make educat-
ed guesses about where in the genome to look for the
culprit mutations. It was the keys-under-the-lamppost
phenomenon: They could only examine genes they
already suspected were involved in the cancer. But as
the speed and efficiency of DNA sequencing skyrocket-
ed, and its price plummeted, it started to look reason-
able to sequence the whole tumor genome to cast the
widest possible net. By 2010, when the bladder cancer

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030418.txt,"“Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects,” newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He was
certainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few moments
in his company and you know this to be true.

When I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that
“Andy”—as Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his strange
title is. Because if one thing’s for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what he’s talking
about far more than “Andy” does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other financiers hang out
with him.

And Ghislaine?
Full disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It’s almost impossible not to.

She is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I’ve spent hours
talking to her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is curious.
She has spent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent me a DVD of
the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away almost anyone else’s I can think of—probably even Rupert Murdochs’.
She is very well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill Clinton with whom she is
close friends.

Yet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-Platero,
(Known fondly to her close friends as “the Tennis Goddess”) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When it comes
down to things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her vulnerability.

And that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey.

“He saved her,” I remember a close friend of mine telling me. “When her father died, she was a wreck; inconsolable.
And then Jeffrey took her in. She’s never forgotten that—and never will.”

In many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect replacement
for her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his sexual pecadillos, but
then Ghislaine’s father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving a massive “black hole” he’d
fraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey's habits may not have seemed that strange.

In fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful people
in the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl issues, and
moved countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You don’t tend to get to
the top by being the world’s most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett didn’t quite manage a
normal life—whatever that is. He had a second “wife” for many years whose existence he has been open about.

So what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven’t spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her
loyalty to friends like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about as always. Look at
Waksal and Stewart. No one sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up for all sorts
of blemishes.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011000.txt,"Edward West had written in 1815 that in economies already developed, there isn’t
much room for more capital of the same kind. Its productivity disappears in capital
glut and diminishing returns. There could still be growth when some of the new
ideas would need only redeployment of existing kinds of capital, as in relocating
production nearer to the market or cutting out the middleman. This redeployment
was Solow’s “disembodied growth.” But growth after that have to come from capital
new in kind. Hourglasses might have to give place to pocket watches, or sailing ships

to steamships. Those were Solow’s “embodied” growth.

The apparent problem here is that novelty is expensive. There are blind alleys and
failure rates and learning curves that rote replication avoids. This is true somewhat
even in disembodied growth, where redeployment is already a step into the
unfamiliar. If depreciation investment is barely enough for balanced growth without

new ideas, how can it also pay for the failure rates and learning curves?

A tough question. And Mill was posing an even tougher one. The paragraph quoted
is clearly describing capital acceleration. Capital as he describes it is not only
innovating consistently as it keeps up with consumption, but picking up the pace,

and still taking the innovation costs in stride. Is that too much even for Achilles?

It is not. Charts and tables show that the kind of growth Mill describes has proved
the only kind in every country and period where tests are practical. It has proved
the only kind whether capital was growing faster or shrinking faster or anything
between. The growth bronco bucks, and the consumption rider stays on. This is
what clearly happens, or anyhow has happened so far, despite so many reasons to

think it is impossible. What would explain it?

First take the lesser puzzle. Balanced growth, where capital, output and
consumption all grow at the same constant rate, must make do with depreciation
investment. How can it in crowded niches where growth compels the costs of

innovation? Chapter 2 showed my inference that these are the costs of being human.

With three notable exceptions, the flights to them had stopovers in a country that was an ally of
the US, and which could seize Snowden. The three exceptions were China, North Korea (via
China) and Russia.

The only one of these three countries, or any other country, that Snowden is known to have
dealt with directly during his 33 day stay in Hong Kong, was Russia. As previously discussed, he
had dealings with Russian “diplomatic representatives “, as Putin called them. Putin did not
provide the date of these contacts but he provided an intriguing clue. Snowden was identified to
him, according to Putin, not by name but merely as an “agent of special services.” Putin’s
description suggests the meeting had taken place before Snowden became a household name on
June 9, 2013.

For his part, Snowden was evasive when discussing his contacts with Russia while still in
Hong Kong. When Lana Lam asked Snowden on June 12, 2013 whether he had already
requested asylum from the Russia government, he deferred, saying: “My only comment is that I
am glad there are governments that refuse to be intimidated by great power.” As it turned out,
Snowden was correct. The Russian government was not intimidated by the threats of reprisals by
the United States, as the Obama Administration would learn after his arrival in Russia on June 23,
2013. But the only way that Snowden could not have known that fact on June 12 was by being
in contact with Russian officials prior to his interview with Lam. Of course, he may have had
multiple contacts on different dates with these officials. The Russian pro-government
newspaper Kommersant reported that Snowden had visited the Russian consulate on more than
one occasion and had been given a birthday celebration there on June 21, 2013.

What we do know about Snowden’s interactions with the Russians in Hong Kong comes partly
from Putin’s own description of them. Putin said, it will be recalled, that his decision to facilitate
Snowden’s escape to Russia had been kicked all the way up the Russian chain of command for
him to personally decide Snowden’s fate. Presumably, this decision-making process began earlier
than June 21, 2013, when he reportedly came to the consulate. The question is: how much
earlier? Since Snowden had arrived in Hong Kong on May 20, 2013, his contacts with Russian
officials could have occurred as long as a month earlier. That would fit in with Snowden telling
Gellman on May 24 that he needed his help in dealing with the diplomatic mission of an unnamed
country. In any case, Putin tells us he learned an American “agent of the special services” had
contacted Russian diplomats because he wanted assistance. And Snowden did need assistance to
escape from Hong Kong. As he had no visas, he would require the sort of assistance that could
only be provided by a government willing to defy the United States. The assistance came from
Russia.

Nine days before Snowden boarded Aeroflot flight SU213 to Moscow on June 23, the US had
filed a criminal complaint against him. It had also alerted Hong Kong authorities and Interpol
when it unsealed the complaint on June 21, 2013. And on June 21st it had invalidated his U.S.
passport (although he still had it in his possession at the Hong Kong Airport.) Since by this time

3.6 Postscript: Formalizing Pattern

Finally, before winding up our very brief tour through patternist philosophy of mind, we will
briefly visit patternism’s more formal side. Many of the key aspects of patternism have been
rigorously formalized. Here we give only a few very basic elements of the relevant mathematics,
which will be used later on in the exposition of CogPrime. (Specifically, the formal definition of
pattern emerges in the CogPrime design in the definition of a fitness function for “pattern min-
ing” algorithms and Occam-based concept creation algorithms, and the definition of intensional
inheritance within PLN.)
We give some definitions, drawn from Appendix 1 of [Goe06a];:

Definition 1 Given a metric space (M,d), and two functions c: M — [0,co| (the “simplicity
measure”) and F: M —> M (the “production relationship”), we say that P © M is a pattern

seemed to defeat the purpose of going into politics in the first place.

Still, I had no appetite for rushing into a challenge to Peres’s leadership, both
because it was bound to be difficult for both of us, and frankly because it seemed
rash, premature and maybe even unnecessary. Bibi was beginning the negotiations
to form a government, and that process was likely to take at least a few weeks.
Shimon had yet to signal whether he did intend to stay on. Still, when he invited
me for a late-night chat at his apartment a week after the election, I was concerned
he might raise the leadership issue and I knew that, if he did, I would have to be
honest and open with him.

The conversation went very differently than I’d expected. After he’d poured
each of us a glass of Armagnac, and offered me a plate of Sonia’s cakes, he spoke
for a while about Bibi, though he could not even bring himself to utter the name.
This man, he said, knew nothing about leadership, much less about running the
country. He would be outmaneuvered, overshadowed and ultimately controlled by
the “real strongman” in the Likud: Arik Sharon. I said I thought we were again
underestimating Bibi’s strength, as well as the effect of the country’s new electoral
system. He was the first Prime Minister to enjoy a direct, personal mandate. That
turned upside down the balance of power and influence in our politics. As he
assembled his coalition, the other parties, if they wanted to be in government,
would have to deal with him on his terms. So, to a much greater extent than before,
would potential internal rivals.

As we talked, I was struck that Shimon seemed resigned to the election defeat,
relaxed, more at ease with himself than at any time since the start of the grueling
campaign. Then, quite suddenly, he said: “Ehud, I understand the meaning of the
election result. “You will have to take on the leadership, and lead the party.” He
said he didn’t plan to spend the rest of his years hanging around the apartment. He
would remain active — “working for peace” — but no longer in the party political
arena. “I understand the meaning of what has happened,” he repeated. “I will pass
the Labor leadership torch to you. We should find a way to do it quickly, and in the
right way.”

It was nearly three in the morning when I left. I was not just surprised, but
touched, by what he’d said. Shimon was now nearly 73. He’d had a life in our
country’s politics, and in Labor, stretching back to before the state, when he’d been
a favored protégé of Ben-Gurion. Walking away was going to be hard. I was

the operation work.

The Sinai mission marked a transition not just for me, but for others in
Sayeret Matkal as well. Avraham Aranan finally left the unit he’d imagined,
created and built. He became the head of the technology unit in military
intelligence. His deputy, Dovik Tamari, succeeded him, serving the first in what
would become two-year stints for each of his successors as the sayeret’s
commander. I, too, was given a wider role. Though I was still just a young
lieutenant, and too junior for the job, Dovik made me his de facto deputy, with
responsibility for operational oversight of our missions. I returned to the Sinai a
year later, not in that capacity but because of my on-the-ground experience, to
accompany a sayeret team which installed an intercept on a second Egyptian
communications cable.

Though the tzalash was gratifying, what gave me more satisfaction, and
pride, was the importance of the Sinai operations themselves. I was confident
that if we did have to go to war again, the equipment we installed, along with
the bugs on the Golan, would give us an essential edge. But in truth, I didn’t
actually believe there would be another war. Sure, the threat was still there.
Egypt, in particular, still seemed determined to find a way to hobble, and if
possible eliminate, Israel. But especially since the 1956 war, the fedayeen
attacks, and cross-border skirmishes, had been subsiding. Not long after the
second Sinai intercept mission, I was chatting with other officers on the sayeret
base and remember turning to one of them and saying I was sure that by the
time I was married and had a teenage child, we’d be able to take a skiing
holiday in Lebanon. We didn’t have peace yet. That might take time. But I felt
that things were getting more normal.

I began thinking what that would mean not just for Sayeret Matkal or Israel,
but for my own future. By the autumn of 1964, Pd reached a decision: to end
my active service in the unit that had been central to my life since leaving the
kibbutz. Dovik did persuade me to delay, for nearly a year. But at the end of the
summer of 1965, I left Sayeret Matkal. In fact, I left the army altogether. I went
to study mathematics and physics at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. I would
remain involved in the sayeret as a reservist. But I couldn’t see devoting my
adult life to military service in a country which, fortunately, seemed on a
trajectory toward peace. I had spent five years in an extraordinary unit. It had
been more fascinating and fulfilling than I could have dreamed of when I’d

10. In December 2014, Roberts, who had not initially been part of the CVRA action,
was asked to, and did, provide information to Plaintiffs’ counsel in the CVRA case in which she
discussed her sex trafficking by Epstein. On December 31, 2014, Plaintiffs counsel in the
CVRA proceeding (Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell) filed a Motion Pursuant to Rule 21 for
Joinder in the Action (“Joinder Motion”) on behalf of Roberts. Ms. Roberts’s joinder motion
described how she had been sexually trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein and was forced to have sex
with, among others, Alan Dershowitz.

11. Based on Plaintiff’s December 2014 filing, Dershowitz, as he had previously done
to Epstein’s victims, publically and viciously attacked plaintiff's counsel in the CVRA actions,
Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell. Dershowitz, in nationally televised news interviews, wrongfully
claimed that Edwards and Cassell had engaged in unethical behavior warranting disbarment for
filing the Joinder Motion that described Dershowitz’s involvement with Epstein and Roberts.
Edwards, who is a prominent attorney for sexually abused women and children, and Cassell who
is a former United States District Court judge who left the bench to advocate for criminal
victims, sued Dershowitz for defamation. Edwards and Cassell asserted that the factual
allegations that Dershowitz had knowledge of and participated in Epstein’s criminal conduct
were entirely proper and well founded and that Dershowitz’s statements about Edwards and
Cassell were defamatory.

12. ‘In April 2016 Dershowitz settled the Edwards and Cassell defamation claims
against him. As a condition of the settlement, Dershowitz required that the financial terms of the
settlement be kept confidential.

13. In November 2018, after conducting a lengthy investigation that involved

interviewing over eighty (80) women, the Miami Herald published the first in a series of articles

oversee the case for the government. Pak, a former Georgia lawmaker, was appointed Atlanta’s chief federal

prosecutor by President Trump in October 2017.

The Justice Department is still under a Friday deadline for prosecutors to confer with the victims’ attorneys in
an effort to settle the case. On Feb. 22, U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra in Palm Beach ruled that federal
prosecutors, under former Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta, broke the law when they concealed a plea
agreement from more than 30 underage girls in Palm Beach who had been sexually abused by Epstein, a

multimillionaire New York hedge fund manager.

Marra stopped short of voiding the agreement, which granted Epstein and an untold number of accomplices
immunity from federal prosecution for sex trafficking crimes, provided Epstein plead guilty to minor charges in
state court. At the time of the plea deal, federal prosecutors had gathered enough evidence against Epstein to

write a 53-page federal indictment, court records show.

The story behind a Palm Beach sex offender’s remarkable deal

The story behind a Palm Beach sex offender’s remarkable deal

Emily Michot

An investigation by the Miami Herald, “Perversion of Justice,’’ found that after Acosta met privately with one
of Epstein’s lawyers, the government agreed to seal the plea agreement so that no one — not the victims, not
even the state court judge who sentenced Epstein — would know the full extent of his crimes. Epstein, now 66,
was allowed to plead guilty to prostitution charges and served 13 months in the Palm Beach County jail, where
he was given liberal work release, and allowed to travel to New York and his private island in the Caribbean
during his subsequent house arrest. He was released in 2009, and now divides his time between New York,
Palm Beach and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The Herald interviewed four of Epstein’s victims, who were as young as 13 at the time they were abused by
Epstein. They said they felt betrayed by state and federal prosecutors, who treated them like prostitutes instead
of victims. Two of them sued the federal government in 2008 under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, which

grants crime victims the right to be informed about plea deals and to confer with prosecutors.

Marra, in a 33-page opinion, said prosecutors not only intentionally violated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, but
they misled the girls into believing that the FBI’s sex trafficking case against Epstein was ongoing — when, in

fact, prosecutors had secretly closed it after sealing the plea bargain from the public record.

Marra, noting that he reviewed affidavits, depositions and interrogatories, said “Epstein worked in concert with

others to obtain minors not only for his own sexual gratification, but also for the sexual gratification of others.’

idea that one needs background knowledge in order to read, which is
both true and a product of various works in cognitive science.

Hirsch was made to look like a fool so often that he resorted to hir-
ing a cognitive science professor at Virginia, who has written a book
justifying the same nonsense with more cognitive science facts.”

There is plenty of work in cognitive science that shows that back-
ground knowledge helps people interpret the world around them, and
thus reading, for example, is facilitated by having knowledge about
the world about which you are reading. This idea, however, does not
imply that ramming facts down a kid’s throat is the way for them to
acquire that background knowledge. Knowledge acquisition is a natu-
ral result of engaging in cognitive processes that are being employed
to satisfy a truly held goal.

If you are trying to find your way around a city, you will learn the
streets of that city and develop what is called a cognitive map. If you
try to memorize those same streets, it simply won’t work. Real knowl-
edge is acquired as a natural part of an employed cognitive process in
service of a goal. But Hirsch and Willingham know nothing about cog-
nitive processes. They only know, and talk about, how best to acquire
more facts. Politicians listen to them and there are more tests to make
sure those facts have been acquired. No one remembers Algebra II or
much about the Founding Fathers because that stuff is mostly facts
acquired independent of any real goals that will employ those facts.
Knowledge is not the real issue in education or in mental life. The
real issue is developing facility with doing various cognitive processes.
Knowledge comes along for free with practice of these processes in
specific domains.

There is no evidence whatsoever that accumulation of facts and
background knowledge are the same thing. In fact, there is plenty of
evidence to the contrary. Facts learned out of context, and apart from
actual real-world experience that is repeated over and over, are not
retained.

Why don’t kids like school? Because we teach them knowledge
that they know they won’t need. How do they know this? They know
that their parents don’t know this stuff—that is how. Many kids don’t
like math much and it is clear why. They find it boring and irrelevant
to anything they care about doing. If we think math is so important,
then why not teach it within a meaningful context, where it actually
is used? There is plenty of evidence that shows that teaching math

RPE No. 30793  
Cuba in its new stage: SWOT Analysis 
Fundacion Internacional para la Libertad (International Foundation for Freedom) 
New York, 8 November 2015 
On August 14th, 2015, the United States flag was raised in Havana, formally reestablishing diplomatic 
Relations between the United States and Cuba, which had been interrupted since January 3, 1961, 
some 54 years ago, when Ike Eisenhower was in power in Washington and Fidel Castro in Havana. 
The President of the United States, Barack Oba ma, and his Secretary of State, John Kerry, among many 
other personalities, have requested the lifting of the economic embargo imposed on Cuba by John F. 
Kennedy in 1962, in the midst of the Cold War, and in recent days through Havana have come Germans, 
French, Dutch, and Spaniards to propose bridges to the Island. 
The perception is that Cuba, the largest of the thirteen markets in the Caribbean and with the largest 
population, followed very closely by the Dominican Republic, again opens itself up to international trade 
and relations. 
Overview of the Spanish Antilles 
Cuba: 110,860 Km2 — 11,031,000 inhabitants — GDP per capita (PPP) US$10,200. 
Dominican Republic - 46,670 km2 — 10,349,741 inhabitants — GDP per capita (PPP) US$12,800 
Puerto Rico: 13,790 km2 — 3,620,897 inhabitants — GDP per capital (PPP) US$16,300 
For purposes of brevity and objectivity, given the composition of this audience, I'm going to employ the 
structure of the so-called SWOT analysis for contributing to the business decision of investing in that 
market, refraining from doing so, or awaiting greater clarity and better times. It will not be my function 
to recommend what should be done, but rather to place certain data and basic elements on the table for 
decision-makers. They will know what is best for them to do. 
The SWOT analysis, as we know, lists the positive Strengths, the present Opportunities, the Weaknesses 
perceived, and the Threats detected. 
Strengths 
1. The thawing announced simultaneously by Presidents Barack Obama and Ratll Castro 
last December 17th, to which are added the various steps taken by both governments in 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025094 
the direction of reconciliation, have created an atmosphere of triumphalism regarding 
the economic future of Cuba loaded with good expectations. 
2. According to the surveys, support for Obama's measures is notably of the majority in 
both the United States and Cuba, but there are reasons to believe that a substantial 
percentage of Cuban exiles also support it. 
3. As part of this approach, it's expected that some or many foreign companies will explore 
the possibility of investing in the Island. There is significant human capital available in 
Cuba: over eight hundred thousand university students and a generally healthy and 
educated populace. 
4. The Cuban government, after 56 years of continuous exercise of power, appears solidly 
in control of the situation, without any person or group whatsoever that visibly 
challenges its authority with any possibility of success. 
5. After Hugo Chavez's election to the presidency of Venezuela at the end of 1998, that oil-
producing country transferred to Cuba enormous amounts of resources. The economist 
Carmelo Mesa-Lago calculates the annual amount of aid at its highest point as thirteen 
billion dollars. 
6. A quarter century after the disappearance of the Communist block, the Castro 
government, together with North Korea, has shown itself to be the exception to the rule: 
It has maintained control without renouncing the principles of Marxism-Leninism and 
the single party system, although cautiously attempting to modify its productive 
apparatus. 
7. In that spirit of reforms-within-the-system, in April 2010 Raul Castro presented what 
are known as Guidelines, outlining his reform of the State, creating spaces for foreign 
investment and freelancers. 
8. The most important or most visible institutions in Cuban society, such as the Armed 
Forces and the Assembly of the People's Power, appear to fully support the steps taken 
by the president, General Rail Castro, in the direction of a re-encounter with the United 
States. 
9. Some foreign offices of the European Union, such as the Spaniards, the Germans, and 
the Dutch, look favorably on what is happening, as does the Vatican, which has 
participated in the secret meetings to bring an end to the conflicts between Cuba and 
the United States. Pope Francis has announced his upcoming visit to Cuba as a kind of 
support for the changes. 
10. Cuba exercises enormous influence in the countries of the ALBA, and the clear 
leadership of the group known as the nations of the XXIth Century Socialism: Venezuela, 
Bolivia, Ecuador, and Nicaragua. 
11. To this list we must add the sympathy and solidarity that Cuba inspires in governments 
such as those of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, and El Salvador. In summary, the 
Island has never had a more international identification. 
Opportunities 
1. The country needs to rebuild almost all of its infrastructure. Everything is obsolete or in 
ruins: aqueducts and sewerage systems, electrical grids, the Internet, bridges and roads, 
telecommunications, homes and buildings. 
2. There is fertile land for the local production of food. Cuba imports 80% of the food 
consumed by people and animals. Before 1959 the proportion was reversed. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025095 
3. The sugar industry, which before the revolution was the backbone of the economy, with 
an annual average production of six million tons, has dropped to two. 
4. Tourism is a very promising field. The Island, very beautiful and with dozens of beaches, 
has at least 14 points on both coasts that are potentially transformable into ideal sites 
for building tourism poles similar to Puerto Banils in Spain or Casa de Campo in La 
Romana, Dominican Republic. 
5. Considering the number of researchers in the field of medicine, totally under-utilized, 
the country would potentially be the perfect partner of large international 
pharmaceutical industries, to both develop new medications and produce them. 
6. Given the prestige (today somewhat reduced) of its health system, Cuba is potentially an 
excellent site for medical tourism and a place to establish links with the North American 
insurance systems. Havana is much closer to Key West than Miami is to Orlando in 
Florida. 
7. Whenever relations are really normalized and travel is facilitated and multiplies, Cuba 
will become an ideal place to retire for tens of thousands of Cuban Americans and North 
Americans who perceive an average of US$1,800 a month. 
8. Cuba receives some three million tourists every year, and has eleven million inhabitants. 
In a few years it could receive eleven million tourists and reach the classification of 
paradise. A few daring and intelligent developers could transform the Isle of Pines, in 
Cuba's south, into the Mallorca of the Caribbean. In the United States there are 300,000 
luxury yachts that could visit Cuba and dock in already existing as well as future marinas. 
9. If relations between the United States and Cuba continue to deepen, it's possible to 
foresee a Free Trade Agreement that would allow the Island unlimited exports to the 
richest market in the world. 
10. Because of its geographical position, Cuba is an ideal hub for the distribution of ocean-
going and air cargo to North and South America. 
11. Cuban-Americans, as occurred in the case of Taiwan and China, could transfer to Cuba 
their business expertise, their relationships, and the capital they've created, which 
would integrate the Island into the business and trade world of the United States. 
12. The country, as happened in post-Communist Europe, would be the paradise of the best-
known North American fast-foot franchises such as MacDonalds, Burger King, KFC, etc.. 
13. The same thing would occur with department store chains: Zara, Corte Ingles, Macys, 
Sears, and the rest of the best known establishments. 
Weaknesses 
1. The government of Raul Castro doesn't want a regime change but rather an 
improvement of the Communist model initiated in 1959. According to published and 
verbal statements, the model foreseen isn't even the Chinese or Vietnamese model, but 
rather a Military Capitalism of State, where the government reserves the control of the 
2,500 largest enterprises in the country, which it exploits directly through the military 
apparatus or in partnership with foreign capitalists. Cubans will not have access to the 
means of production, but rather to small service enterprises (small food businesses, 
beauty salons, etc.). 
2. The government of Raul Castro does not believe, as Deng Xiaoping proclaimed in 1992, 
that enriching oneself is glorious. Raul and Fidel continue to believe that capitalism is 
an evil expression of the worst human tendencies, and despite those who practice it. In 
Cuba, entrepreneurs are not encouraged, but discouraged. Capitalists may be 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025096 
temporarily necessary, but always under the strict control of the political police in order 
to avoid ideological contamination of the people and the excesses of which they are 
capable. The government continues to uphold the supremacy of centralized planning 
over the market, and the virtues of frugality and non-consumption. 
3. If an entrepreneur wants to evaluate the country risk before investing anywhere, he 
looks at the Moody's or Standard & Poor's ratings. According to these risk rating 
companies, Cuba appears on the most dangerous fringe. There is a very long history of 
arrests or simply noncompliance with obligations, and of re-financing which has turned 
out to be useless. They haven't been able to pay their debts due to a serious and basic 
problem: Cuban society is very unproductive due to the collectivist economic system 
that they have imposed on it, and because of the size and priorities of public 
expenditures decided on by the government. 
4. The Cuban State lacks substantial reserves, and barely generates sufficient income to 
survive from month to month. This means that it does not have its own resources to 
undertake the large public works that it needs, and it requires international loans in 
order to confront them, which becomes a serious problem because it does not possess 
reliable credit. 
5. In Cuba there are no impartial courts to which one can resort in the case of a dispute of 
civil law, much less criminal law. There is an absolute legal defenselessness in the face 
of any conflict with the government or with a state-owned enterprise. The government, 
according to its needs, arbitrarily pursues, imprisons, or releases any citizen, including 
foreign businessmen with whom it has a dispute. In other words, the reverse of a true 
State of Law. That circumstance can be testified to by dozens of persons, including the 
Panamanian Simon Abadi, the Chilean Max Marambio, or the Canadian SArkis 
Yacoubian. 
6. Foreign businessmen located in Cuba live under the not-so-discreet surveillance of the 
security forces, always in the paranoid search for the mythical and evil agent of the CIA. 
Many of the Cuban officials and simple neighbors or potential friends don't dare to link 
themselves to foreign businessmen out of fear of losing the government's trust, or are 
forced to inform in writing about any voluntary or involuntary contact they've had with 
them. 
7. Cuba has not resolved the very important problem of currency. Officially, the dollar 
exchange is approximately on a par with the Cuban peso. On the parallel market it's 24 
pesos to 1 dollar. Cubans collect in pesos, but the government sells to them in dollars, 
which creates significant dissatisfaction and an obvious sense of injustice. 
8. Salaries are very low (some US$24 a month), which determines the nonexistence of a 
potential market of 11 million consumers. Cubans have the lowest purchasing power 
per capita in Spanish-speaking America. 
9. The banking system is insufficient and primitive. Dollar deposits — as has happened in 
the recent past — may be frozen at the discretion of the government. 
10. Bureaucracy is very slow and insecure. Officials don't dare to make decisions, and the 
instructions they receive are sometimes contradictory. 
11. The hiring of workers is done through a state-owned company that charges investors in 
dollars and pays in pesos to the Cubans assigned to these jobs. In the transaction, the 
Cuban State keeps 94% of the salary. That practice contravenes international 
agreements signed with the ILO. 
12. For over half a century, Cubans have been accustomed to stealing from the State in 
order to survive, by swelling on the black market the product of that theft. These habits 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025097 
are transferred to the private sector, particularly because they have lived under an 
intense propaganda campaign against the capitalist exploiters. They know that 
socialism leads to disaster, but they believe that capitalism is an activity of hungry 
wolves. 
Threats 
1. A substantial part of the policy of reconciliation between Obama and Rat.11 Castro 
depends on the lifting of the embargo. Although there is great pressure from the White 
House, and surveys showing that the majority of Americans want the sanctions to end, 
there are no guarantees that this will be achieved during this presidency. Neither can 
one predict what will happen with the relations between the two countries if the next 
elections are won by a Republican candidate. Two of the most prominent ones, Jeb 
Bush and Marco Rubio, have criticized President Obama for his new Cuban policy. 
2. The repeal of the 1996 Helms-Burton is one of the key requirements for Cuba to be able 
to approach the IDB, the IMF, or the World Bank. Without that credit, which requires 
Cuba's affiliation with these organizations, the Island will have no access to loans to 
rebuild the costly infrastructure that the country needs. It's a very slow process that will 
take a great deal of time. 
3. Cuba depends in large measures on subsidies from Venezuela, and Chavism is going 
through a very bad time, which could end up in its destruction and substitution with a 
government unfavorable to the Cubans. The disappearance of Chavism in Venezuela 
would be an economic and political catastrophe for Cuba. Today the popularity of 
Nicolas Maduro is less than 20%. 
4. The political stability of the Cuban regime until now has depended on control by Fidel 
and Rat.11 Castro. Fidel just turned 89, and Rat.il will be 84 in June. With them the 
generation of the revolution will come to an end, giving way to younger people, led by 
RaCJI Castro's chosen heir, Engineer Miguel Diaz-Canel, who is 55. What's going to 
happen then? Could the regime transmit the authority within the Community single-
party model without the old leaders who until now have lent shape and sense to the 
government. Will there arise other candidates with uncontrollable ambitions, 
presumably young military men, with the intention of taking command? Nobody knows. 
Nevertheless, Cuban history has been bloody when regimes reach their end. They are 
replaced by violence. 
5. It will be very risky to invest in properties confiscated from their legitimate owners 
during the first years of the revolution. In both the United States and Spain there are 
organizations of those injured who are willing to go to court in defense of their rights, 
and who have hired lawyers to do just that. Originally the victims of the confiscations 
were North Americans or Spaniards, but over time Cuban-Americans and Hispano-
Cubans have been added. Both the United States Congress and Senate and the Spanish 
Parliament have legislators with these origins. 
6. What will probably happen will be something similar to the case of Nicaragua. 
Nicaraguan exiles, infinitely fewer in number and power than the Cuban-Americans, 
without congressmen in Washington with their origins, managed to condition American 
aid to the solution of the confiscations they had suffered during the first decade of the 
Sandinista government. What's predictable is that the injured Americans, together with 
the Cuban-Americans, will manage to halt any American aid or benefit destined for Cuba 
until their property is returned to them or they are compensated for them. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025098 
7. Although in the tourism sector there is an evident possibility of making money in Cuba, 
it's doubtful that the North American hotel industry, almost all present on the Stock 
Exchange, subject to North American legislation and union pressure, would lend itself to 
collaborating with the Cuban counter-intelligence by facilitating eavesdropping/wire-
tapping and clandestine filming inside hotel installations, such as today occurs in Melia 
and other European chains, violating even Cuban law which supposedly defends the 
inviolability of privacy. American lawyers are very clear about the high price German 
companies had to pay when they associated themselves with Nazism, as occurred with 
Volkswagen and Bayer. 
8. Even though this is not a matter of investing in a country living under a dictatorship, but 
rather of associating oneself with a dictatorial government in order to exploit workers 
and companies, it's very possible that, whenever the opportunity presents itself, those 
businessmen linked to the Cuban government are going to be accused in court because 
of the confiscation of 94% of the salary through the exchange of dollars for pesos and 
other violations of the rules of the International Labor Organization. Workers' claims 
will be very high, and there are American law firms willing to bring them in exchange for 
a percentage of whatever is eventually received. 
9. Lastly, two articles of the Cuban constitution profile the inflexibly Communist nature of 
the regime, and become a permanent threat against foreign investors. Article 5: The 
Communist Party of Cuba, Marti-inspired and Marxist-Leninist, organized vanguard of 
the Cuban nation, is the superior directing force of society and the State. Article 62: 
None of the liberties recognized to citizens may be exercised against what is established 
in the Constitution and laws, or against the decision of the Cuban people to build 
socialism and communism. The violation of this principle is punishable.

I have known Jean Luc Brunel professionally for several: yeare through
our work together and, in my opinion, he ie an extremely talented
individual] with superb professional reputation. He is an lextraordinarily
able coordinator who atrives for and attains a level of merit in his work
that only a few of his contemporaries meet. He haz the ability to
recognize the creative vision of his client within the time and budget
through his careful and thoughtful choice of model casting combined
with his meticulous ability in the eld. Jean Luc Brune! ip a true find in
our industry. |

There are plenty of art directors out there, but none with the depth and
quality that Mr. Brunel posseseca. He is unlike anyone in this industry,
and I expect to see him continue to find great models in hia successful
career. Someone overflowing with talent as Jean Luc Brunel should be
given every opportunity to work in the United States, where he will have
the proper venurs to showcase his extraordinary talents.

Please do not hesitate te contact me should you have ‘any questions
regarding this matter. Lice you for your time and -ednsideration.

It continues: “Defendant Epstein recklessly inflicted emotional
distress on Plaintiff Brunel by engaging in illegal conduct with
under-aged girls, which was falsely linked to Plaintiff. ... This ille-
gal conduct was extreme and outrageous by any standard.”

The suit went on to quote Brunel's doctor, who said that the
modeling scout had gone into psychotherapy “due to a subjective
sense of depression related to what he believes is a loss of business
in his modeling agency as a result of slander published against his
business.” Brunel had gone on prescription drugs—Prozac,
Rivotril—as a result.

The fashion world had frozen him out, he said, after his relation-
ship with Jeffrey Epstein had become public. It had become impossi-
ble for him to find the “fresh faces” he needed for his agency, MC2.

Brunel acknowledged Epstein’s alleged crimes but denied his
own involvement. “Epstein’s illegal activities were outrageous
and extreme; they involved receiving massages from the under-
aged girls while the girls were nude or nearly nude; penetration
of the girls with a finger or object; or full intercourse.”

When the Daily Beast reported the story and reached out to
Brunel for a comment, the website’s reporter was told, “Jean-Luc
is not in town; he’s in South America.”

Brunel's agency, MC2, is still in business.

this may be a long shot to save the Boeing deal, or if you think its a dead deal, disregard this. 
I thought there was a connection between Tarek and myself, I do believe one concern was operation of Boeing with 
flight crew. I know its his problem not ours, but may help make the sale happen,. 
I wrote this email for your review, if you think its worth sending, please critique, and let me know,. thank you: 
Mr. Tarek El Sayed, 
I hope this email finds you well, and believe worth communicating my thoughts to you. 
I was surprised to hear that you decided against the purchase of our Super Boeing 727. I personally thought it was a great match for 
your business needs in Qatar. If for any reason your decision was based on crew issues and charter needs in the Middle East, I'd like 
to share some information that might prove beneficial to making you reconsider this purchase. 
The pilot candidates I have lined up for your interview along with the possibility of David Rodgers joining your flight department 
were as follows: 
(at no time did I disclose location or persons to the following pilot candidates to protect your privacy.) 
Robert Breslin, who is the former Chief Pilot of Mr. Donald Trump, Mr. Breslin flew the Boeing 727 and Boeing 757 owned by Mr 
Trump. Mr Breslin is a fine man of 40 years of age estimate, with extensive VIP Boeing operations. 
James Bartakowski, who has extensive flying experience in the Middle east, Africa and Europe regime. Mr. Bartakowski has also 
been involved in charter operations in Africa and Middle East and has contacted me on several recent occasions with charters for 
our Boeing 727, James has indicated there is the possibility of 40 — 60 hours per month charter operations for larger transport 
category aircraft in your area. I believe there is a growing need for charter in the business community in Qatar and neighboring 
countries. 
Bruce Jafahri, who is a current Boeing 727 captain who lived in Doha for two years, and familiar with international operations of 
Boeing 727 aircraft. Mr. Jafahri currently lives in California and ready for a new opportunity. Bruce is current in the Boeing 727 and 
also flew Captain on the Boeing 747. Well qualified individual and personable. 
Mr. El Sayed, as you have seen during our demo flight, our Boeing 727 is in impeccable condition, quite cabin and will provide many 
years of charter and business flights your company. I believe the large business jet future in Qatar is growing and you will be leading 
its path, and your initial investment in this purchase will not come close with other aircraft options on the market as you may have 
seen already. 
We are currently completing the C2C check on the Boeing, and as we have done in the past, assure you it will be a fine aircraft 
when it leaves Flight Star Maintenance repair facility.

map and compass helped. But I soon realized that it was almost impossible to
get an accurate reading from inside the truck. Every few minutes, I waved the
convoy to stop, got out, and walked fifty or sixty yards into the sand and clumps
of acacia trees and calibrated our progress from there. My fallback was the
stars. From them, I could at least make sure we were headed in broadly the right
direction. But the need to navigate around the dunes meant we were never
moving in a perfectly straight line. The miles ticking by on the truck’s odometer
couldn’t tell me exactly how far we’d travelled. A couple of times, I realized we
were wandering off line — not by a much, but enough to risk leaving us either a
mile or two south of where we were supposed to go or, worse, on the Egyptian
side of an unmarked desert frontier that, especially at night, would look pretty
much the same on either side.

Finally, a few hours before dawn, I brought the convoy to a halt. I climbed
out, walked back to the staff sergeant and told him, with more confidence than I
felt: “We’re here.” I had no way of knowing for sure. But I felt we were
generally in the right place. Before we’d set off, I was briefed by the officer in
charge of one of the operational APC battalions. He had been to the area before,
on training exercises. Because of the emergency call-up, he was too senior to
lead a supply convoy. But he told me that once we got there, we should stop and
wait. He would follow our tracks the next morning and link up with us. An hour
after sunrise, we saw his jeep bobbing over the sand towards us. He pulled to a
stop, shook hands with the staff sergeant, and then he turned to me.
“Unbelievable,” he said. ““We’re where we need to be.”

Our role in the grand scheme of things, and certainly mine, was hardly
decisive. But the rest of the border mobilization also went to plan. That, along
with some frantic diplomatic activity and a healthy common sense on all sides,
ensured that a new war with Egypt was averted — at least for a further half-
dozen years, until 1967. By then, the lesson of Rotem would be learned: our
need to find a realiable way to tap into the battle plans of the hostile Arab states
around us. And through another wholly unexpected turn of events starting just a
few weeks after the Rotem Crisis, I would turn out to play a personal role in
making that happen.

With reported CBD use skewing toward younger consumers, it is perhaps not surprising
to see that CBD also over-indexes to lower-income consumers (where younger
consumers generally have lower household incomes). What is more, CBD seems to be
the most popular among Caucasians, following by Hispanic / Latino consumers.
Meanwhile, CBD use is slightly more popular among women (7.0% incidence), vs. men
(6.7% incidence).

Edwards predicted that it would take some time for Pak’s office to review the case, which includes more than 500
docket entries and thousands of documents. He said If the sides can’t agree on a resolution, then Marra would likely
have to come up with one. The case is being closely watched by crime victims’ rights advocates, as it will likely set

a precedent.

Acosta, who was appointed by Trump as the U.S. secretary of labor in 2017, is the focus of a separate Justice
Department investigation into whether there was any prosecutorial misconduct in the Epstein case. That probe, by
the DOJ’s Office of Professional Responsibility, was initiated in response to demands from a bipartisan group in
Congress, led by Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of
Florida.

In the meantime, a court hearing will be held at 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York in another Epstein-related case. A
federal appeals court will hear oral arguments in a motion by the Miami Herald, supported by 32 other news
organizations, asking the court to unseal documents that could reveal details about the extent of Epstein’s crimes and

any other people who may have been involved.

Three of Epstein’s former attorneys — who helped negotiate his plea deal in 2008 — wrote a letter published in the
New York Times on Monday, defending the plea bargain cut with Acosta as a fair deal. The letter was in response to
a Times editorial that called on Congress and the Trump administration to hold Acosta and others involved in the

case accountable.

Epstein’s lawyers said the editorial’s conclusions were “in profound conflict with the reality,’’ noting that there was
no evidence that Epstein committed federal sex trafficking offenses. The letter was signed by former Epstein lawyers

Kenneth Starr, Jack Goldberger and Lilly Ann Sanchez, as well as Epstein’s current attorney, Martin G. Weinberg.

CABIN
COUTURE
A daring designer goes for the runway
48 jetGALA
Clients always want
their aircraft to be
modern and up-to-date,
while maintaining an
understated, luxurious
aesthetic
In a 50,000-square-foot hangar at Long Island’s MacArthur Airport, an aircraft interiors
project has its designer “fired on all cylinders”. Tasked to modify and refurbish a
Global 5000 for the sports entertainment giant, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE,
formerly WWF), New York-based International Jet Interiors is putting a progressive spin
on cabin design. While the livery boasts WWE’s corporate colours, the interiors use
“hand-woven carpets, custom-made metal finishes including a spun black pearl finish,
custom-dyed leathers and bespoke seating from Italy”, says Eric Roth, the designer at
International Jet Interiors’ helm.
But the highlight is in the high-tech facilities: studio-grade equipment that enables on-thefly
editing of feeds from live sports entertainment shows, which are transmitted via on-board
satellite. Meanwhile, specially programmed iPad minis control the cabin functions. “It will be
the ultimate couture craft when completed in January 2014,” says Roth.
No stranger to special client requests, Roth says he loves the challenge — the more unusual
the request, the more he and his team seem to excel in delivering the solution. His clients
come from around the world with a varied wish-list, ranging from entertainment systems with
satellite TV and high-speed WiFi to 24-karat gold-plated fixtures throughout the craft. >>
The more unusual the request, the more Roth and
his team seem to excel in delivering the solution
JETGALA

WINGS
“Helping clients strategise is a key part of the
design process. I look at how long they have owned
the craft and at its depreciating asset value”
50 jetGALA
Details set Roth’s work
apart from other aircraft
interiors — from the
choice of lighting, carpet,
upholstery and cabinetry,
to gadget stowage and
dining accessories
>> Its refurbishment of Donald Trump’s Boeing 757,
for instance, included a 24-karat gold-plated bathroom
sink. Other projects have required reconfiguring the
seating layout to make kennel space for hunting dogs,
installing ultra-secure bassinets for newborn infants,
and wrapping a toilet seat in crocodile skin for a client
in India.
Roth says that as a designer and design director,
his main task is to develop an intimate understanding
of a client’s lifestyle and his use of the jet — the
percentage of time spent for business, pleasure,
corporate entertainment and family time. “Helping
clients strategise is a key part of the design process. I
look at how long they have owned the craft and at its
depreciating asset value, and work out if it’s worth it to
invest in the latest piece of technology or ultra comfort
accessory. Most of them will opt for the investment
because they want their aircraft to be up-to-date, even if
this does not up its asset value.”
At times, thorough strategising is needed even before
International Jet Interiors accepts a project. A US-based
film producer once wanted a ‘sky studio’ so that he
and his four-member team could edit films onboard
his Gulfstream. This required state-of-the-art editing
equipment, surround sound, and a 42-inch, flat-screen,
high-definition TV. “The client perceived the theatre >>
JETGALA
51
WINGS
52 jetGALA
>> aspect as the great challenge — yet it was balancing
the weight of the floor-plan change and equipment
furnishing that was the real challenge. The structural
and technical analysis consumed the better part of
three weeks before we could make the commitment to
produce this unique aircraft,” says Roth.
Despite many quirky refurbishing requests, Roth says
a fair percentage of his clients avoid using their aircraft
to make a statement: “They will come to me saying ‘Eric,
I want it to be luxuriously comfortable,
very functional but extremely understated’.” Nearly
75 per cent of the firm’s clients are US-based, but it is
now receiving more requests from private-jet owners in
Asia. The company has worked with clients in Shanghai,
Tokyo and Mumbai, and is in discussions with new
customers in Africa.
He hopes to one day produce a “green and
sustainable” solution for a client. That may sound like
an oxymoron, and it will take a designer used to pushing
the limits of convention to create such a ground-breaking
design. It looks like Roth is cut out for the job.

drop by the amount of Bill’s maintenance consumption on Phil’s books asa

slaveowner. So then does Bill’s present value of that cash flow.

This noir thought experiment is worth thinking through. It shows that even if
slavery were legal and common, its market evidence would neither show the value
of human capital nor refute the fact that human capital is inalienable. It is
inalienable for the reason, if none other, that our maintenance consumption satisfies
no one else’s tastes. Phil did not acquire Bill’s human capital. He converted it to

livestock worth much less.

Another useful point is that assets in general tend to be worth more to their owners.
This does not contradict the convergence axioms. We buy or build to taste. That
difference is particularly important as to assets not meant to be traded, such as
productive plant. I suspect that this is what the national accounts missed in

adjusting depreciation.

Maintenance Learning

Ben-Porath argued, persuasively | believe, that both kinds of investment in human
capital must end when not enough time remains for recovery with interest. Those
two are invested consumption, including schooling, and self-invested work. I
propose that invested consumption substantially ends at maturity and
independence. Self-invested work of learning continues long after, as there remains

no other adequate explanation of age-wage profiles. When does it stop?

Learning itself continues to the end. Yet if Ben-Porath is right, and he is, self-
invested learning stops well before. What continues, | think, is what I call
“maintenance learning”. It is defined as learning to keep up pay now rather than to
enhance pay later. At all ages, we must learn the names and traits of new clients and

co-workers and suppliers and regulations continually to do what we are paid for.

cooperation is the same as that of Adam Smith in the Wealth of Nations. Once a
medium of exchange is introduced into a system of barter, itself a reciprocal
relationship, it can be vastly extended, with specialization such that one individual
no longer produces ten pencils/day, but ten people are specialized to produce a
single pencil—and thus a thousand/day. | too share an aversion to cultural/group

male self-domestication is more important in damping male psychopathy than

Peter’s argument on reduction of inter-birth interval in humans again veers off into
culture-land when one does not need it—paternal investment, grandmother
investment and older sibling investment are all expected on genetic grounds. The
authority on the subject is David Haig at Harvard.

psychologists. As part of the AGI Roadmap project, specific tasks were created corresponding
to each of the sub-areas in the above list; we will describe some of these tasks in Chapter 17.

2.3.2 Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences

The diverse list of human-level “competencies” given above is reminiscent of Gardner’s [Gar99|
multiple intelligences (MI) framework — a psychological approach to intelligence assessment
based on the idea that different people have mental strengths in different high-level domains,
so that intelligence tests should contain aspects that focus on each of these domains separately.
MI does not contradict the “complex goals in complex environments” view of intelligence, but
rather may be interpreted as making specific commitments regarding which complex tasks and
which complex environments are most important for roughly human-like intelligence.

MI does not seek an extreme generality, in the sense that it explicitly focuses on domains
in which humans have strong innate capability as well as general-intelligence capability; there
could easily be non-human intelligences that would exceed humans according to both the com-
monsense human notion of “general intelligence” and the generic “complex goals in complex
environments” or Hutter /Legg-style definitions, yet would not equal humans on the MI crite-
ria. This strong anthropocentrism of MI is not a problem from an AGI perspective so long as
one uses MI in an appropriate way, i.e. only for assessing the extent to which an AGI system
displays specifically human-like general intelligence. This restrictiveness is the price one pays
for having an easily articulable and relatively easily implementable evaluation framework.

Table ?? summarizes the types of intelligence included in Gardner’s MI theory.

Intelligence Type Aspects
Linguistic Words and language, written and spoken; retention, inter-

pretation and explanation of ideas and information via lan-
guage; understands relationship between communication
and meaning

Logical-Mathematical Logical thinking, detecting patterns, scientific reasoning
and deduction; analyse problems, perform mathematical
calculations, understands relationship between cause and
effect towards a tangible outcome

Musical Musical ability, awareness, appreciation and use of sound;
recognition of tonal and rhythmic patterns, understands
relationship between sound and feeling

Bodily-Kinesthetic Body movement control, manual dexterity, physical agility
and balance; eye and body coordination

Spatial-Visual Visual and spatial perception; interpretation and creation
of images; pictorial imagination and expression; under-
stands relationship between images and meanings, and be-
tween space and effect

Interpersonal Perception of other people’s feelings; relates to others; inter-
pretation of behaviour and communications; understands
relationships between people and their situations

| After long probe,
billionaire faces
solicitation charge

By LARRY KELLER
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer

Palm Beach billionaire Jeffrey Epstein
paid to have underage girls and young
women brought to his home, where he re-
ceived massages and sometimes sex, ac-
cording to an investigation p—a_
by the Palm Beach Police
Department.

Palm Beach police spent
months sifting through Ep-
stein’s trash and watching
his waterfront home and
Palm Beach International
Airport to keep tabs on his “
private jet. An indictment Epstein
charging Epstein, 53, was
unsealed Monday, charging him with one
count of felony solicitation of prostitution.

Palm Beach police thought there was
probable cause to charge Epstein with un-
lawful sex acts with a minor and lewd and
lascivious molestation.

Police Chief Michael Reiter was so angry

dling of the case that he wrote a memo

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012955.txt,"3.2 Some Patternist Principles 39

— Example: Building towers has been useful in a certain context, but so has building
structures with a large number of triangles. Why not build a tower out of triangles?
Or maybe a vaguely tower-like structure that uses more triangles than a tower easily
could?

— Example: Building an elongated block structure resembling a table was successful in the
past, as was building a structure resembling a very flat version of a chair. Generalizing,
maybe building distorted versions of furniture is good. Or maybe it is building distorted
version of any previously perceived objects that is good. Or maybe both, to different
degrees...

Next, for a variety of reasons outlined in [Goe(6a] it becomes appealing to hypothesize that the
network of patterns in an intelligent system must give rise to the following large-scale emergent
structures

e Hierarchical network. Patterns are habitually in relations of control over other patterns that
represent more specialized aspects of themselves.

— Example: The pattern associated with “tall building” has some control over the pattern
associated with “tower”, as the former represents a more general concept ... and “tower”
has some control over “Eiffel tower”, etc.

e Heterarchical network. The system retains a memory of which patterns have previously
been associated with each other in any way.

— Example: “Tower” and “snake” are distant in the natural pattern hierarchy, but may be
associatively /heterarchically linked due to having a common elongated structure. This
heterarchical linkage may be used for many things, e.g. it might inspire the creative
construction of a tower with a snake’s head.

e Dual network. Hierarchical and heterarchical structures are combined, with the dynamics
of the two structures working together harmoniously. Among many possible ways to hier-
archically organize a set of patterns, the one used should be one that causes hierarchically
nearby patterns to have many meaningful heterarchical connections; and of course, there
should be a tendency to search for heterarchical connections among hierarchically nearby
patterns.

— Example: While the set of patterns hierarchically nearby “tower” and the set of patterns
heterarchically nearby “tower” will be quite different, they should still have more overlap
than random pattern-sets of similar sizes. So, if looking for something else heterarchically
near “tower”, using the hierarchical information about “tower” should be of some use,
and vice versa.

— In PLN, hierarchical relationships correspond to Atoms A and B so that InheritanceAB
and InheritanceB A have highly dissimilar strength; and heterarchical relationships cor-
respond to IntensionalSimilarity relationships. The dual network structure then arises
when intensional and extensional inheritance approximately correlate with each other,
so that inference about either kind of inheritance assists with figuring out about the
other kind.

e Self structure. A portion of the network of patterns forms into an approximate image of the
overall network of patterns.

that we’re enmeshed in networks now; no, we're enclosed even entrapped by them.
If the great ambition of Cecil Rhodes’ era was for the expansive conquest of
territory, in our own it is for the construction and manipulation of gated spaces.
Gatelands.

In an age of network power, no position is more important, formidable, influential
or profitable than that of the gatekeeper. Defining who is in or out of any network is
among the most essential moves of design. In financial markets, on the Internet
backbone or inside the human immune system, the accept-or-reject decision
determines a great deal. The first sign of order breaking down, whether it is the
Roman Empire or your lungs, is an inability to manage what slips in and out. Flows
of bits, of migrants, of gold and patents and medicines -— all of these life-giving forces
can be controlled, bent for good or stopped for ill, as they pass through or collide
with gates. By gates I mean not only in-out passages but all of the tools that meter
and enclose the various Gatelands: Protocols, languages, block-chains. Whatever
binds and shapes an information topology. Any sort of code or encryption or binary
instruction that can unlock an in and out. If you want to make a fortune or a
revolution (or both), if you hope to shatter some barrier of tools or ideas between
you and a dream, or to lead a religious revival, spread an infection of hate or
revolution or insidious Morris-style computer code — then fundamentally this is
what you have to consider: Where are the gates? How to smash them? How to build
your own? We are entering, as a result of our dependence on networks of all sorts, a
landscape where the very clustering of power creates new border regions, bridges
and gates. If older, hierarchical systems craved a top - a king, a superpower, a Pope
- our connected, meshlike age demands valves and protocols and gates. It hungers
for connection, which means it hungers too for throttles and accelerators and
brakes. And of course people to run them. To speed them up. Slow them. Finger off
switches. This reordering of power will produce, is producing, a fight over
topological spaces for finance, biology, trade or pretty much any source of power.
The scramble is as urgent, decisive and essential as the one Rhodes and his peers
embarked upon. Inside or out? A fresh Meliananxiety haunts us: Are you the
gatekeeper? Or the gatekept?

We wander into Gateland the moment we switch our phones on. We enter it when
we book an airline ticket, when our genetics folds into a pool of data, or when we
take a new degree, master a computer language, or check on friends via one stateful
connected platform or another. We enter it, in short, when we connect. Gatekeepers
choose what we see. They determine the rules we follow, what we can and can’t
change. They reward us too - once we're inside — with benefits of speed, knowledge
and safety. Gatekeepers, which can be people or protocols or code, decide who can
join closed communities and who is left out and why. They pass us the fine benefit of
the compression of time, even as they expose us to the zipper of instant potential
disaster hitting everyone in a closed space at once. Gatekeepers control, for instance,
how (and how fast) financial data moves between members of light-speed “in the
know” trading pools, and the suckers outside. What you can see in your phone or
your university computer, why, how - all of these choices have to be made by

what General Tzur really wanted to know. I think what he actually wanted to
gauge was whether / felt confident. He wanted to reassure himself he wasn’t
taking any more than the obvious risks in sending us, in Uri Ilan’s footsteps,
back into Syria. Fortunately, he didn’t ask whether I was sure we’d succeed. If
he had, I would have said, yes, we were prepared. But there was no way we
could be certain. Still, he must have got what he wanted. When we reached the
edge of Netanya, he shook my hand, wished me luck and went on his way.

The rest of the team was waiting at the crossroads for me to join them. Two
teams, in fact: mine, with whom Id be crossing into Syria in less than 10 hours’
time, and our hillutz, or back-up. A hillutz was always a part of sayeret
operations. The back-up group would stay on the Israeli side of the border. If we
got into trouble, they’d come in after us.

Even after my briefing for the chief of staff, we had one last stop to make on
the way north. It was at the headquarters of the army’s northern command. It
was in a Tegart fortress, one of dozens built by the British around the country,
with watchtowers on each corner of the outer walls. The northern commander
was an equally forbidding figure. Avraham Yoffe had served in the British
artillery in the Second World War and the Golani Brigade in 1948. He used to
joke with other officers that while they looked like a bunch of kids, he was the
only one with the true bearing of a general.

He must have been busy when we arrived, because we ended up hanging
around in the courtyard for nearly 20 minutes. Just as I was beginning to worry
that the timetable for what really mattered — our climb up onto the Golan — was
being put at risk, I noticed that off to the side was a beautifully polished jeep. I
assumed it belonged to General Yoffe, who was known to be an avid hunter and
would later become the head of Israel’s National Parks Authority. It had a
padlocked metal grill on the back which held two jerrycans of gasoline. Yori
Cohen, the commander of the back-up team, and I spotted the fuel containers at
the same time. We couldn’t help smiling. Yes, we were about to embark on an
operation which, assuming we didn’t fail, would finally give Israel real-time
intelligence from across our border for the first time since the 1950s. But we
were still Sayeret Matkal, still chronically short of gasoline for our field
exercises. And I still hadn’t forgotten how to pick a lock. As Yori stood guard, I
broke into the grill and removed the jerrycans, one for each of us, and closed it
again. Then, after briefing the general, we headed to our setting-off point. Yoffe
himself left to join Avraham Arnan and Meir Amit’s intelligence deputy,

Consumer interest in CBD continues to gain momentum. For beverages, in particular
water, this is evidenced by analyzing current Google Trends, where interest rose
considerably over the course of 2018 and looks to still be achieving new highs, which is
not surprising, given the recent passage of the U.S. Farm Bill.

Over the next 2 years we believe that the U.S. CBD water category can generate close to
$600 mm in revenues. In Nielsen, U.S. bottled water generated just over $13 bn in 2018.
Assuming Nielsen channels account for 50% coverage of the category implies total
revenues of over $26 bn. Applying the 4.2% CAGR the category has grown over the last
3 years and extrapolating out results in total revenue surpassing $28 bn by 2020. Our
estimates are premised on CBD water achieving a ~1.5% market share in 2019 anda

note that a ~2% share of the bottled water category compares to a ~3% share for
coconut water. With the amount of consumer interest and potential functional benefits
that come along with CBD, we believe that a modest 2% share of the category is
reasonable, in particular if multiple larger players within the beverage space enter the

opportunity assuming different market share levels.

A Socratic Dialogue

Sit down before fact as a little child, be prepared to give up
every conceived notion, follow humbly wherever and whatever
abysses nature leads, or you will learn nothing.

—Thomas Huxley

Slave Boy: So it really doesn’t matter how you classify a teaching/
learning problem because there are many methods that could
apply, correct?

Socrates: And what follows from this?

Slave Boy: That it is not the classification that matters but the
methods entailed in that classification.

Socrates: And what do all these methods have in common?

Slave Boy: They all involve practice

Socrates: And what else?

Slave Boy: Real experience.

Socrates: And how is experience stored?

Slave Boy: Through cases.

Socrates: Expressed how?

Slave Boy: As stories

Socrates: So what follows from all this?

Slave Boy: That the methodology entailed in each classification of
learning types is not the real issue.

Socrates: And what is the real issue?

Slave Boy: Practice

Socrates: And?

Slave Boy: Dialogue

Socrates: Why dialogue?

Slave Boy: Because it is through dialogue that stories are solidified
and indexed

Socrates: So the classification of learning types doesn’t really matter
then, does it?

There are many constraints to making changes

— ~90 million citizens (29% of Americans)’ have grown accustomed to entitlement
programs - 47MM on Medicaid, 45MM on Medicare, and 51MM on Social
Security, and many of them vote.

— Politicians depend on re-election campaigns, which can create conflicts,
especially given that only 12% of the population are willing to cut Social Security
and Medicare benefits, per Pew survey in 2/11.

— Low personal savings rates (near 6% of disposable income in CQ2:10), high
unemployment (near 10%) and economic uncertainty, which can limit ability to
make radical change.

- 14 million healthcare-related workers? have grown accustomed to relatively high
healthcare spending.

President Obama will travel to Israel and 
the occupied Palestinian territories next 
month to make an early second-term push 
for peace negotiations between two 
divided governments and to assess the 
broader political developments remaking 
the Middle East. 
It will be Obama's first trip as president

at Middle East peacemaking. 
The choice of destination — one that 
Obama avoided in his first term — 
suggests a revival of his ambitions abroad

policy issue just months after winning his 
second term. 
But the visit will highlight how much the  
region has changed since he last visited 
the Middle East in his first year in office, 
with the rise of Islamist governments and 
the widening repercussions of civil 
revolt. 
After Obama helped topple Moammar  
Gaddafi in Libya in 2011, many in the 
region wondered when he would emerge 
again to help shape the course of the 
tumultuous Arab Spring, which has 
replaced a pair of U.S.-allied 
dictatorships with elected Islamist 
governments. 
Within the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, 
much has changed since the direct peace 
talks Obama inaugurated in September  
2010 collapsed within weeks. Israel's 
recent battle with the armed Hamas 
movement in the Gaza Strip left many  
predicting a wider fight in the future, as 
divisions deepened within the Palestinian 
and Israeli electorates over whether talks 
or war would resolve the conflict. 
To make it a substantive trip that is 
more than a positive photo-op would 
require setting up a specific framework 
for an agreement and setting a tight 
deadline to achieve it, said Jeremy Ben-
Ami, the executive director of J Street, a 
nonprofit group that advocates the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029693 
creation of a Palestinian state alongside 
Israel. 
White House officials would not provide 
a date for Obama's trip, which he will 
squeeze into the tight schedule he is 
building around a busy domestic agenda 
that includes immigration, guns and the 
economy. 
But Israeli media reported that Obama is 
scheduled to arrive March 20 as part of a 
trip that will include a stop in Jordan, 
where the civil war in next-door Syria 
and its growing refugee crisis is 
presenting a major challenge to King 
Abdullah II, a U.S. ally. 
Obama began his first term by making a 
strong push for peace talks between Israel 
and the Palestinians, believing the 
conflict fueled radicalism in the region in 
general and toward the United States in 
particular, given its historical support for 
the Jewish state. 
In contrast to predecessor George W. 
Bush, Obama wanted to demonstrate to 
Arab governments that the United States 
would make demands of Israel in pursuit 
of a regional peace agreement. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu made little secret of his 
preference for Republican Mitt Romney  
in last year's U.S. presidential campaign. 
Netanyahu and Obama have at times 
disagreed bitterly over issues relating to 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029694 
the Palestinians, including Israel's 
continued settlement construction in the 
West Bank and East Jerusalem. 
Israel's military occupied those 
territories, along with Gaza, in the 1967 
Arab-Israeli war. Palestinians view them 
as the key territorial elements of their 
future state. 
In a June 2009 address in Cairo, a speech 
that asked for a new beginning with the 
Islamic world, Obama said: The United 
States does not accept the legitimacy of 
continued Israeli settlements. He also 
did not stop in Israel on that trip, instead 
visiting Saudi Arabia, Egypt and 
Germany, where he emphasized the  
horror of the Holocaust and the moral 
imperative of defending Israel. Romney, 
among others, made the omission a 
campaign issue. 
But on regional security issues, Obama 
and Netanyahu have deepened 
cooperation amid rising U.S. military aid 
to Israel. Obama has agreed with 
Netanyahu that Iran must not be allowed 
to use its uranium-enrichment program to 
develop a nuclear weapon, an issue that 
the two will discuss during Obama's 
visit. 
Netanyahu's Likud party emerged from 
elections last month as the largest bloc in 
Israel's parliament, meaning that he will 
serve another term as prime minister. But 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029695 
a surprisingly strong showing by a new 
centrist party is likely to put more 
pressure on him to pursue talks. 
It was a mistake for Obama not to go in 
the first term at a time when it could have 
affected Israeli public opinion of him, 
and now, it has hardened against him to a 
point that I don't believe it can, said 
Elliott Abrams, a senior fellow at the 
Council on Foreign Relations who served 
as a senior Middle East adviser to Bush. 
Obama's visit will coincide with growing 
concern in the region that the two-state 
solution favored by him is in peril, as 
Israeli settlement construction continues 
and as the Islamist Hamas gains clout 
within the once-secular Palestinian 
nationalist movement. Hamas emerged  
stronger politically from the recent clash 
with Israel and continues to reject the 
Jewish state's right to exist. 
Hamas and its secular rival Fatah are due 
to meet Saturday as part of a 
reconciliation process. If an agreement is 
reached and Hamas joins the Palestinian 
Authority, Obama will be faced with an 
awkward decision on whether to meet 
with a government that includes members 
of a U.S.-
designated terrorist movement. 
As he begins again in the region, Obama 
will be advised by new Secretary of State 
John F. Kerry. He has also named former 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029696 
senator Chuck Hagel as defense 
secretary, a nomination still in question 
after an unsteady performance by the 
candidate before the Senate Armed 
Services Committee last week that 
focused in part on his past criticism of 
Israel. 
This trip is a signal that the president 
has an interest, not just in the peace issue, 
but also in the broader concerns that 
Israel is facing, said Dennis Ross, a 
senior Middle East adviser to Obama 
during his first term who is at the 
Washington Institute for Near East  
Policy. In some ways, it will be the 
president traveling to Israel to ask for a 
new beginning. 
Article 2. 
Foreign Policy 
Saeb Erekat - The Peace  
Processor  
An interview by Aaron David Miller 
February 5, 2013 -- Other than Mahmoud 
Abbas, Saeb Erekat could be the most 
recognizable Palestinian on the planet. 
The chief Palestinian negotiator is 
certainly among the most passionate in 
promoting the cause. And nobody on the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029697 
Palestinian side knows the substance of 
the issues or the negotiating history 
better. 
I first met Erekat in the late 1980s, while 
working on the Palestinian issue for then 
Secretary of State George Shultz. Back 
then, the U.S.-educated diplomat was 
already showing the brashness and 
outspokenness that would make him one 
of the most memorable -- if exasperating 
-- of the Palestinians with whom we 
dealt. 
He annoyed then Secretary of State 
James Baker by wearing his kaffiyeh 
around his shoulders at the opening of the 
Madrid Peace Conference in October 
1991. And over the years, he continued to 
annoy the Israelis too with his fiery 
performances on CNN -- though to this 
day, key Israeli negotiators, such as Isaac 
Molho, continue to praise his pragmatism 
at the bargaining table. 
It was Erekat's academic bent, analytical 
chops, and capacity to write in English 
that would make him so indispensable to 
the only Palestinian who really counted 
in those days -- Yasir Arafat. Erekat was 
a unique figure -- neither a fighter (no 
nom de guerre for him), nor a PLO 
insider, nor an organization man from 
Tunis. Rather, he was a West Banker 
from Jericho, and he succeeded in 
maintaining his relevance in a Palestinian 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029698 
political scene dominated not by fellow 
academics, but by hard men defined by 
struggle and intrigue. During the heady 
days of the peace process, he became a 
key point of contact for the Americans, 
the Israelis, the Arabs, and much of the 
rest of the international community. 
I came to know Erekat not only as a 
negotiator, but as a person. He sent his 
kids to Seeds of Peace, a conflict 
resolution and coexistence organization 
that I ran briefly after leaving the State 
Department, and my daughter befriended 
his and stayed with the Erekats in 
Jericho. Saeb and I have yelled at each 
other, defended our respective positions, 
laughed, and mourned opportunities that 
were never adequately explored. But 
through it all, what he said about himself 
was true: He wasn't as pro-Palestinian or 
pro-Israeli as much as he was pro-peace. 
That peace has proven elusive to this day. 
But with all our differences -- and there 
are many -- I believe Erekat believes in 
its possibility. Who else would list as an 
objective on his resume: Solve the 
Palestinian-Israeli conflict based on a two 
state negotiated solution through 
diplomatic offices? 
If, or perhaps when, another effort to 
negotiate a deal is made, one thing is 
clear -- Erekat will be in the middle of it. 
Last week, he agreed to answer my 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029699 
questions on the past and future of the 
Israeli-Palestinian problem. 
FP: What were your best and worst 
moments in the Israeli-Palestinian 
negotiations, and what was the greatest 
missed opportunity? 
Saeb Erekat: Though I was not the chief 
negotiator at that moment, the connection 
between [then Prime Minister Yitzhak] 
Rabin and President Arafat made 
everyone around them, including myself, 
feel that peace was possible. There was 
significant progress in all tracks until 
Rabin's assassination by an Israeli 
terrorist -- after he was killed, no Israeli 
leader had the vision to understand that 
the window of opportunity for a two-state 
solution would close as fast as they 
continued their colonization policies. 
The missed opportunity has definitely 
been Israel throwing away the Arab 
Peace Initiative, which offers 
normalization of relations of 57 countries 
with Israel in exchange for Israeli 
withdrawal to the 1967 border. They 
threw it away by bombing Gaza, by 
intensifying collective punishments, and 
by increasing settlement construction all 
over the occupied West Bank, 
particularly in and around Occupied East 
Jerusalem. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029700 
FP: 2013 is the 20th anniversary of the 
Oslo negotiations. What was Oslo's 
greatest success, and its greatest failure? 
SE: The fact that, two decades after Oslo, 
we are still a nation under occupation 
shows that Israeli governments did derail 
it. The interim accords were not supposed 
to last for 20 years but only five. After 
that, we were going to enjoy freedom and 
sovereignty. 
But Israel increased its settlement 
expansion. In fact, within 20 years, the 
number of settlers almost tripled. The 
institution-building efforts led by the 
Palestinian government have been 
completely undermined by the lack of 
freedom. This situation cannot continue. 
Oslo succeeded in bringing back 250,000 
Palestinians from the diaspora and 
building the capacity for our state. The 
international community failed though, 
by granting Israel an unprecedented 
culture of impunity that allowed them to 
use negotiations as a means to continue 
rather than stop colonization. 
FP: What is the most important 
thing Israelis don't understand about 
Palestinians? 
SE: That we are not going anywhere. As 
simple as that. We are not going to 
disappear just because their government 
builds an annexation wall around us. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029701 
They should close their eyes and imagine 
their state within 10 years time. What do 
they see? If they continue their policies, 
they are going to officially adopt the form 
of an apartheid regime, which I think is 
not what many Israelis want. 
FP: What is the most important thing 
Palestinians have learned about Israelis? 
SE: That Israelis will not take back the 
ships that brought them here to leave 
somewhere else. We got to understand 
that we have to live side by side. The 
rules of engagement, though, cannot be 
those of apartheid, but those of freedom. 
FP: What do you expect from the next 
Israeli government on the peace process? 
SE: I don't think there is room for 
optimism, but our position hasn't 
changed. We don't see any other solution 
than a two-state solution. Any Israeli 
government that recognizes this fact and 
respects what previous governments have 
agreed upon should become a partner for 
peace. 
FP: Is Hamas-Fatah unity possible, and 
what would the impact be on the future of 
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations? 
SE: We expect to have progress in the 
near future, with Hamas allowing the 
Central Elections Commission to register 
new voters in Gaza. I believe there is 
political agreement -- in fact, there is a 
signed agreement. We expect to have 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029702 
elections as soon as possible, which is the 
right way to solve our differences: Let 
our people decide, those in Palestine as 
well as our people in the Diaspora. 
Having said so, Hamas has recognized 
the Palestine Liberation Organization as 
the sole and legitimate representative of 
the Palestinian people, including its 
mandate to negotiate a final status 
agreement with Israel. Once that is 
achieved, we expect to hold a national 
referendum. 
FP: How would you describe Egypt's 
role in the peace process now? What do 
you expect from President Barack 
Obama's administration with regards to 
the peace process? 
SE: Egypt has played a central role, and 
continues to do so. We trust that Egypt, 
under President Mohamed Morsy's 
leadership, will continue to play a strong 
role because Palestine and Egypt have a 
common interest in achieving peace. 
President Obama had stated that he has a 
personal commitment to bring peace to 
the Middle East. We, the Egyptians, and 
the rest of the Arab world tell him that we 
are ready for peace. We have the Arab 
Peace Initiative. This goes in line with 
the stated U.S. national interest. 
Washington's failure to explicitly say that 
Israel is to blame for choosing 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029703 
settlements over peace has contributed to 
Israel's culture of impunity. 
FP: Can America be an effective broker 
in negotiations? 
SE: If the U.S. decides to be an honest 
broker, it could not only be effective but 
in fact could bring real peace to the 
region, a just and lasting one. The U.S. 
has a moral obligation toward the 
Palestinian people, who have been under 
occupation and living in exile for 
decades. 
FP: Is a two state solution still possible? 
SE: Yes, but only if there is a political 
will. So far, Israel's will is about 
colonization, and the international 
community has failed to put an end to 
decades of double standards by treating 
Israel as a state above the law. We don't 
see any other solution than a two-state 
solution, though Israel is taking us to a 
one-state reality.

The Mixed Legacy Of 
Shimon Peres  
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029704 
Daniel Gavron 
Feb 4, 2013 -- Now that he has finished 
his consultations with the country's 
political parties and charged Benjamin 
Netanyahu with forming a new coalition, 
Israel's respected President, Shimon 
Peres, is once again very much in the 
news. In his speech inviting Netanyahu to 
form the next government, the President 
spoke forcefully about peace and even 
seemed to influence Bibi to mention 
peace, a word he never used in his 
election campaign. Peres has rightly 
earned respect for this from many 
quarters, but now, as the coalition is 
being formed, it might be a good time to 
examine one aspect of Israel's political 
culture: the lack of respect for the task of 
a parliamentary opposition. Peres is at 
least partly to blame for this, as he almost 
always preferred to join various 
administrations—even as a junior 
partner—rather than lead the opposition, 
ofen citing our grave situation and 
national responsibility. Now is surely 
a better time to criticize Peres than in 
June, when the world (maybe even 
including President Barack Obama) will 
be coming here to celebrate his 90th 
birthday. Then, surely, everyone will be 
paying deserved tribute to the wisdom of 
this elder statesman and prophet of peace, 
and it would be a shame to spoil the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029705 
party. So let's clear the air right now, 
well before the festivities. Before we get 
to the matter of coalition politics, which 
is very much on our minds right now as 
Netanyahu struggles to put together a 
government, let us consider the other 
negative part of the Peres legacy: his stint 
as Defense Minister under Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin from 1974 to 1977. Today 
Peres is widely respected as the architect 
of the Oslo Accord of 1993, achieved 
while he was Foreign Minister. It was the 
first political move toward a settlement 
between Israel and the Palestinians, and 
Peres deserves huge credit for securing 
the agreement. However, two decades 
earlier, as Defense Minister, he supported 
the Jewish settlement project in the 
newly-conquered Palestinian territories, 
both overtly and covertly. Not for 
nothing did Rabin label Peres in his 
memoirs as an indefatigable intriguer. 
In 1975, while Rabin was doing his 
utmost to prevent the settlement of Elon 
Moreh, near Nablus, Peres continuously 
sabotaged his efforts. After no less than 
eight settlement attempts, which were 
ruled illegal by Israel's Supreme Court, a 
compromise was reached, and Elon 
Moreh was established five kilometers to 
the east of the original site. Moreover, 
during the furor over Elon Moreh, 
Defense Minister Peres quietly facilitated 
the creation of Ofra, near Ramallah. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029706 
These two settlements, which have 
become flagships of the settlement 
movement, were the start of Jewish 
colonization in Samaria, the northern part 
of the West Bank. The previous year, as 
a young reporter, I interviewed Peres, 
after he and his political ally Moshe 
Dayan had refused on principle to join 
the government of Golda Meir. If a 
single child can learn that politics is not 
just intrigues, Peres told me, I will be 
satisfied that we have done our bit. Just 
one week later, when he and Dayan had 
reversed their position for no discernable 
reason, and were seated snugly around 
the cabinet table, I asked Peres what he 
had to say to the single child. His aides 
sniggered, but Peres didn't bat an eyelid: 
Just what my mentor, David Ben-Gurion 
(Israel's first Prime Minister) told me: 
when the security of Israel is laid on one 
side of the scales, and everything else on 
the other side, security tips the 
balance. Peres subsequently used that 
self-same argument to join every 
government that would have him. The 
late Menachem Begin lost nine elections 
before finally becoming Israel's Prime 
Minister in 1977. He served as a 
pugnacious and dedicated leader of the 
opposition. Peres almost never headed 
the opposition, always preferring a 
ministerial appointment, once even 
designing a grotesque system of 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029707 
rotation with Yitzhak Shamir, so that 
he could be in the government. He 
proposed the ideal of national unity, 
and greatly devalued the democratic 
concept of parliamentary opposition. 
Former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni 
ruined her reputation when she refused to 
join Netanyahu in his last government. 
While it is quite true that Livni was an 
ineffective opposition leader, it is the 
very fact of her refusal to join the 
administration and influence it from 
within that has provoked most of the 
criticism by Israeli political 
commentators. Similar criticism is 
currently being leveled at Labor Party 
leader Shelly Yachimovich for stating 
clearly that she would not join 
Netanyahu's next government, but would 
serve as leader of the opposition. There 
are certainly many reasons to criticize 
Yachimovich, but not her eminently 
democratic decision to lead the 
parliamentary opposition. Very few of 
our political commentators have ever 
expressed respect or even understanding 
for the concept of opposition. The most 
popular political idea in Israel today is 
national unity—better still, a National 
Unity Government: We should all rally 
round the flag and support our 
government in these critical times. This 
position, widely espoused, echoes what 
Peres has said repeatedly over the years. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029708 
So, although the Peres vision of peace is 
a positive legacy, he has also taught us 
less helpful lessons. The settlements are a 
supremely negative inheritance, but I 
would argue that the anti-democratic 
rejection of the concept of a 
parliamentary opposition is an even more 
harmful bequest handed down to us by 
President Shimon Peres.

India vs. China vs. Egypt 
Thomas L. Friedman  
February 5, 2013 -- New Delhi -- It's 
hard to escape a visit to India without 
someone asking you to compare it to 
China. This visit was no exception, but I 
think it's more revealing to widen the 
aperture and compare India, China and 
Egypt. India has a weak central 
government but a really strong civil 
society, bubbling with elections and 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029709 
associations at every level. China has a 
muscular central government but a weak 
civil society, yet one that is clearly 
straining to express itself more. Egypt, 
alas, has a weak government and a very 
weak civil society, one that was 
suppressed for 50 years, denied real 
elections and, therefore, is easy prey to 
have its revolution diverted by the one 
group that could organize, the Muslim 
Brotherhood, in the one free space, the 
mosque. But there is one thing all three 
have in common: gigantic youth bulges 
under the age of 30, increasingly 
connected by technology but very 
unevenly educated. 
My view: Of these three, the one that will 
thrive the most in the 21st century will be 
the one that is most successful at 
converting its youth bulge into a 
demographic dividend that keeps 
paying off every decade, as opposed to a 
demographic bomb that keeps going 
off every decade. That will be the society 
that provides more of its youth with the 
education, jobs and voice they seek to 
realize their full potential. 
This race is about who can enable and 
inspire more of its youth to help build 
broad societal prosperity, argues Dov 
Seidman, the author of How and 
C.E.O. of LRN, which has an operating 
center in India. And that's all about 
leaders, parents and teachers creating 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029710 
environments where young people can be 
on a quest, not just for a job, but for a 
career — for a better life that doesn't just 
surpass but far surpasses their parents. 
Countries that fail to do that will have a 
youth bulge that is not only unemployed, 
but unemployable, he argued. They will 
be disconnected in a connected world, 
despairing as they watch others build and 
realize their potential and curiosity. 
If your country has either a strong 
government or a strong civil society, it 
has the ability to rise to this challenge. If 
it has neither, it will have real problems, 
which is why Egypt is struggling. China 
leads in providing its youth bulge with 
education, infrastructure and jobs, but 
lags in unleashing freedom and curiosity. 
India is the most intriguing case — if it 
can get its governance and corruption 
under control. The quest for upward 
mobility here, especially among women 
and girls, is palpable. I took part in the 
graduation ceremony for The Energy and 
Resources Institute last week. Of 12 
awards for the top students, 11 went to 
women. 
India today has 560 million young 
people under the age of 25 and 225 
million between the ages of 10 and 19, 
explained Shashi Tharoor, India's 
minister of state for human resource 
development. So for the next 40 years 
we should have a youthful working-age 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029711 
population at a time when China and the 
broad industrialized world is aging. 
According to Tharoor, the average age in 
China today is around 38, whereas in 
India it's around 28. In 20 years, that gap 
will be much larger. So this could be a 
huge demographic dividend — provided 
that we can educate our youth — offering 
vocational training to some and 
university to others to equip them to take 
advantage of what the 21st-century global 
economy offers, said Tharoor. If we get 
it right, India becomes the workhorse of 
the world. If we get it wrong, there is 
nothing worse than unemployable, 
frustrated youth. 
Indeed, some of India's disaffected youth 
are turning to Maoism in rural areas. We 
have Maoists among our tribal 
populations, who have not benefited from 
the opportunities of modern India, 
Tharoor said. There have been violent 
Maoist incidents in 165 of India's 625 
districts in recent years, as Maoists tap 
into all those left out of the Indian 
dream. So there is now a huge push here 
to lure poor kids into school. India runs 
the world's biggest midday lunch 
program, serving 250 million free school 
lunches each day. It's also doubled its 
number of Indian Institutes of 
Technology, from eight to 16, and is 
planning 14 new universities for 
innovation and research. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029712 
But this will all be for naught without 
better governance, argues Gurcharan Das, 
the former C.E.O. of Procter & Gamble 
India, whose latest book is India Grows 
at Night: A Liberal Case for a Strong 
State. The aspirational India has no one 
to vote for, because no one is talking the 
language of public goods. Why should it 
take us 15 years to get justice in the 
courts or 12 years to build a road? The 
gap between [youth] aspirations and 
government performance is huge. My 
thesis is that India has risen despite the 
state. It is a story of public failure and 
private success. 
That is what Das means by India grows at 
night, when government sleeps. But 
India must learn to grow during the day, 
he said. If India fixes its governance 
before China fixes its politics that is who 
will win. ... You need a strong state and a 
strong society, so the society can hold the 
state accountable. India will only get a 
strong state when the best of society join 
the government, and China will only get 
a strong society when the best Mandarins 
go into the private sector.

Foreign Policy 
Don't be too sure there  
won't be another U.S.  
war in the Middle East 
Richard L. Russell 
February 5, 2013 -- Shortly before he left 
office in Feb. 2011, Defense Secretary 
Robert Gates told West Point cadets that 
in my opinion, any future defense 
secretary who advised the president to 
again send a big American land army into 
Asia or into the Middle East or Africa 
should 'have his head examined,' as 
General MacArthur so delicately put it. 
The remark no doubt reflected Sec. 
Gates's fatigue and frustration from the 
enormous intellectual and emotional 
burdens associated with overseeing the 
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
One suspects, however, that in a more 
reflective moment, Gates would have 
acknowledged that never say never is a 
wise rule of thumb in planning for 
military contingencies, especially in the 
region that makes up Central Command's 
area-of-responsibility. Few, for example, 
predicted the 1979 Soviet invasion of 
Afghanistan. Gates himself -- who was a 
senior CIA official during the covert war 
supporting the Afghan resistance -- surely 
did not anticipate then that the United 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029714 
States would have to return to 
Afghanistan two decades later to oust a 
Taliban regime that was harboring 
terrorists. Before 1990, moreover, no one 
predicted that Iraq, having just ended a 
bitter eight-year war with Iran, would 
swing its battered forces south to invade 
Kuwait. 
So if it's conventional wisdom that the 
United States will not, or should not, 
intervene militarily in the Middle East or 
South Asia after it draws down forces in 
Iraq and Afghanistan, it's also likely dead 
wrong. What is true, however, is that 
political and military trajectories in the 
Middle East and South Asia are likely to 
increasingly challenge U.S. contingency 
access in the coming decade. The ability 
for the United States to surge large-scale 
forces into the region, as it did in the 
1990 and 2003 wars against Iraq, will 
grow increasingly circumscribed. The 
United States will have to adapt to this 
new strategic landscape by developing 
more nimble, highly-mobile, stealthy, and 
networked forces, and by abandoning the 
traditional practice of slowly and steadily 
building up conventional forces at 
regional logistic hubs prior to launching 
war. 
* * * 
Perhaps the most significant factor that 
portends against further intervention in 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029715 
the Middle East and South Asia is 
increased political resistance -- and 
outright opposition -- from the countries 
in the region. That resistance is likely to 
come from the new regimes emerging 
from the Arab uprisings, as well as a 
number of Gulf monarchies. 
Indeed, the political trends in the region 
are unlikely to conform to the rosy 
predictions of democratic peace theorists, 
whose musings have implicitly informed 
the security policies of both Republican 
and Democratic administrations for 
decades. Old authoritarian regimes seem 
to be passing the way of the dodo bird, 
but the new regimes taking shape are 
heavily influenced by militant Islamic 
ideology that will make them less likely 
to engage in security or military 
cooperation with the United States. 
Democracy optimists argue that these 
ideological regimes, once entrenched in 
power, will have to moderate their zeal in 
order to govern. Pragmatism will 
ultimately trump ideology. That line of 
reasoning, however, is based on the 
assumption that the policy decisions of 
such regimes can be explained by rational 
choice economic theory. In other words, 
if they want to attract international capital 
and participate in the world economy, 
they are going to have to break with their 
ideological affinities. But that reasoning 
ignores a hard fact of international 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029716 
politics: that time and again, political and 
ideological prerogatives trump economic 
rationality. It made little economic sense, 
for example, for Pakistan to pursue a 
nuclear weapons program in the 1970s, 
just as it makes little economic sense for 
Iran to do so today. Clearly, both 
Pakistan and Iran made major policy 
decisions based on political-military 
priorities rather than economic 
calculations. 
As for the surviving monarchies in the 
Middle East, they too will likely be less 
accommodating to American military 
forces than they have been in the past. To 
be sure, much of the Arab support for 
past American military operations -- like 
both Iraq wars -- was hidden from the 
public eye. Arab states often loudly and 
publicly denounced unilateral 
American military action in the region at 
the same time as they supported it in 
backroom dealings, quietly authorizing 
facilities support and air, land, and sea 
access. 
But if Arab Gulf states were quietly 
supportive in the past, their opposition to 
American military force is likely to grow 
in the future. They read the aftermath of 
the Arab uprisings much differently than 
did American and European 
policymakers. The Gulf monarchies were 
shocked that the United States 
abandoned Egyptian President Hosni 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029717 
Mubarak in his time of need in early 
2011. Their leaders expected the United 
States to push for Mubarak and the 
Egyptian military to crack down on 
public protests in Cairo. After all, 
American policymakers during the Carter 
administration had at least given this 
policy option consideration during the 
Iranian revolution in 1979. 
Already, several Gulf states have begun 
to translate their displeasure into policy 
independence from Washington. In 2011, 
for example, a coalition of Gulf states led 
by Saudi Arabia intervened in Bahrain to 
quell domestic unrest in the island 
country. They did so under the banner of 
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), 
which for years had been a feckless 
military force. Largely unnoticed in 
Western commentary was that the GCC, 
for the first time in its history, mounted a 
relatively effective military intervention. 
Bahrain today is for all intents and 
purposes a province of Saudi Arabia, 
even if it is not polite to say so in 
diplomatic circles. Since the Iranian 
revolution, Bahrain -- like the United 
Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar 
-- has pursued close ties with the United 
States, in significant measure to 
counterbalance Iran and Saudi Arabia. 
With Washington at their back, they were 
able to stake out security policies that 
were at least nominally independent from 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029718 
Saudi Arabia. When Saudi Arabia wanted 
American forces removed from the 
kingdom, for example, Qatar was eager 
to compensate by hosting a more robust 
American command presence in the 
region. 
The Arab uprisings and subsequent GCC 
intervention in Bahrain have turned the 
tables, making Saudi security backing a 
necessity for the smaller Gulf 
monarchies. From their perspective, 
American forces are clearly more capable 
than Saudi forces, but given the 
alignment of their interests, Riyadh is a 
more reliable security partner. Gulf 
leaders and military commanders in the 
coming decade will be focused on how to 
avoid following in Mubarak's footsteps. 
Part of minimizing that risk will involve 
decreasing security dependency on the 
United States. Gulf leaders have to worry 
that if push comes to shove, the 
Americans will throw them under a bus 
just like they did to Mubarak. 
* * * 
If the political dynamics in the Middle 
East and South Asia do not favor further 
American military intervention in the 
future, neither do the emerging military 
trends. The proliferation of supersonic 
cruise missiles and mines in the region 
will make for nasty forced entries into 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029719 
narrow maritime confines like the Suez 
Canal, the Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf 
But the likely proliferation of nuclear 
weapons -- and ballistic missile delivery 
systems -- will pose even more 
formidable challenges to conventional 
military surges in the region. In the 
future, the United States will not be able 
to take for granted unchallenged surges 
of naval, air, and ground forces into 
regional theaters via logistics hubs. These 
hubs -- like the American naval presence 
in Bahrain -- are large, readily 
identifiable, and will be increasingly 
vulnerable to future targeting by nuclear 
weaponry. 
Iran's nuclear weapons, assuming it gets 
them, will pose a direct threat to 
American military surge capabilities. 
Although American policymakers and 
military commanders might feel 
confident that they could surge forces 
into the Gulf despite Iranian nuclear 
threats because of the American nuclear 
deterrent, Gulf security partners might be 
more nervous and less willing to 
cooperate. As a result, they might not 
grant access to U.S. air, naval, and 
ground forces out of fear of angering 
Iran. 
American observers who doubt that Gulf 
states would make such calculations 
should recall how Kuwait responded in 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029720 
the lead-up to Iraq's invasion in 1990. 
When faced with a build-up of Iraqi 
forces along its border, Kuwait decided 
not to mobilize its military out of fear 
that the move would provoke Saddam 
Hussein. The incentives for Gulf states to 
make similar strategic calculations in the 
future will be greater when Iran has an 
inventory of nuclear weapons to match its 
growing ballistic missile capabilities. 
The Gulf states, moreover, will likely 
reason that the U.S. capability to threaten 
or use force against a nuclear Iran will be 
significantly diminished. Even without 
nuclear weapons, Gulf states have seen, 
in their view, a long history of American 
reluctance to threaten or use force against 
Iran. For example, the United States took 
no direct military action against Iran after 
it aided and abetted Hezbollah bombings 
against Americans in Lebanon in the 
1980s, after Iran supported the bombing 
of Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia in 
1996, or even after Iran supported the 
deadly campaign of improvised explosive 
devices (IEDs) against U.S. troops in 
Iraq. Gulf states will no doubt judge that 
if the United States was unable and 
unwilling to attack Tehran under these 
circumstances, then it is certainly not 
going to attack Iran in the future, when it 
will be able to retaliate with nuclear 
weapons. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029721 
American policymakers may counter that 
Iran would never be foolish enough to 
threaten or use nuclear weapons against 
the United States, given its robust nuclear 
deterrence posture. But the threat or use 
of nuclear weapons might not look so 
foolish from Iran's perspective. One of 
the great strategic lessons drawn from the 
long history of conflict in the Middle East 
is this: Do not go to war without nuclear 
weapons, as Saddam Hussein did when 
he invaded Kuwait. The corollary is: Do 
not allow the United States to 
methodically build-up forces in the Gulf 
prior to invading, as Saddam did both in 
the run-up to the 1991 re-conquest of 
Kuwait and in 2003, before the drive to 
topple the regime in Baghdad. 
Drawing upon these lessons, Iran will 
likely do everything in its power to deny 
the United States the ability to surge 
conventional forces into the region -- and 
that might include threatening to target 
U.S. forces with nuclear weapons. Iran 
might accept the risk that preemptive use 
of nuclear weapons could bring on 
American nuclear retaliation, because 
failure to do so would mean certain 
destruction for the regime. The United 
States would be able to build-up 
conventional forces in the region and oust 
Iran's leaders just as it did in Baghdad. 
This line of strategic reasoning runs 
counter to conventional wisdom in the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029722 
West, but we actually know little or 
nothing about what Iranian decision-
makers think about nuclear weapons or 
deterrence theory. Since the Iranian 
revolution in 1979, opportunities for the 
exchange of professional views between 
Western and Iranian scholars, 
policymakers, and military leaders on 
these critically important issues have 
been extremely limited. Therefore, it's not 
unreasonable to assume that the Iranians, 
like American policymakers in the early 
stages of developing their nuclear triad 
doctrine, will think of nuclear weapons as 
merely big artillery. Unfortunately, the 
United States and its security partners 
lack formal and informal exchanges with 
the Iranians akin to the Cold War 
discussions and arms control negotiations 
between the Americans and Soviets, 
which allowed both parties to develop 
mutual understandings of the other's 
perception of nuclear weapons. These 
understandings were essential for crisis 
management in the Cold War strategic 
relationship after the Cuban missile 
crisis. 
Meanwhile, the Gulf states, led by Saudi 
Arabia, are likely to look for their own 
nuclear deterrents. Much like France 
wanted its own nuclear force de frappe 
during the Cold War, the Gulf states will 
want their own nuclear weapons to deter 
Iran. Saudi Arabia and the smaller Gulf 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029723 
states will worry that the United States 
would be deterred from coming to their 
defense in future regional crises by Iran's 
nuclear weapons. 
Saudi Arabia and other Arab states are 
likely to see nuclear weapons as a quick 
fix for all of their security woes. 
Although they have been on a shopping 
spree in the past decade, buying 
expensive and sophisticated Western 
military technology, they have had a 
tough time absorbing the new technology 
and fully utilizing and integrating 
weapons systems. To be sure, in a rough  
net assessment, Saudi Arabia and its 
allies in the Gulf have significantly 
greater conventional capabilities than 
Iran. But if Iran goes nuclear, they will 
want to follow suit. 
* * * 
Americans may be weary of conflict in 
the Middle East and South Asia, but 
strategic prudence demands that we 
contemplate future military interventions 
in the Central Command theater. A scan 
of the horizon reveals that both political 
and military trends in the region pose 
formidable obstacles to conventional 
force surges into the region. 
But there is another wrinkle in this story 
that U.S. policymakers must contend with 
as they plan for the future. As Gulf 
monarchies seek to reduce their 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029724 
dependence on American military power, 
they will increasingly look to China for 
security assurances. China does not have 
a political agenda devoted to promoting 
democratization, and it maintains 
political and diplomatic ties with both 
Arab states and Iran. China's military 
activity in the region is modest but 
increasing, as evidenced by its recent 
peacekeeping dispatches to the region 
and naval port visits in the Gulf Beijing 
is likely to send more naval forces to the 
Gulf to increase its presence there and 
enhance its ability to protect the sea lanes 
which bring oil to China's thirsty 
economy. China is keenly aware that the 
United States has naval supremacy in the 
Gulf, but will be working to erode that 
strategic edge in the future. 
Faced with these realities, there is a need 
for new thinking and innovative 
conceptualizations of surges into 
Centcom's area of responsibility. Theater 
campaign planners will have to think 
about contingencies in which the United 
States cannot slowly and methodically 
build up forces in the region and then 
kick off campaigns after most troops, 
arms, and equipment are in place. Future 
U.S. force build-ups in the region will be 
far too vulnerable to preemptive nuclear 
strikes. As a result, planners will have to 
devise campaign plans in which the 
insertion of U.S. military forces begins 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029725 
with an immediate rolling and flowing 
start. The United States will have to work 
from smaller troop footprints and be 
prepared to start fighting even as follow-
on-forces are on the way. Ideally, these 
forces would flow from multiple staging 
positions to reduce vulnerability to 
nuclear attack. The politics of the region, 
however, will work against securing a 
multitude of staging areas from which to 
deploy. 
The region under the purview of 
Centcom has always been riddled with 
political violence that has posed 
formidable challenges to military 
operations. But in plotting a course over 
the horizon, the political and military 
obstacles for American military surges 
into the region are poised to grow even 
larger. As a result, theater contingency 
planners will have fewer good options for 
projecting American military power into 
the region -- and they'll have to do more 
with the bad and the ugly.

The Diplomat 
Getting to the Endgame  
With Iran  
Robert Dreyfuss 
February 6, 2013 -- Why did it take so 
long to secure a date for talks between 
Iran and the P5+1? 
After all, in the weeks before the 
presidential election in November, it was 
reported that the United States and Iran 
had already tactically agreed to convene 
private, one-on-one talks. And since then 
the United States, the European powers, 
Russia, and China, all sought to arrange 
another round of negotiations, first in 
December and then in January. It now 
appears that Iran, which is about to enter 
its presidential election season, has 
finally agreed to what will be the first 
round of negotiations with the P5+1 since 
the last round in Moscow seven months 
ago. On Tuesday, Tehran announced that 
it will join talks on February 26 in 
Kazakhstan. 
The negotiations will be a serious test for 
the Obama administration and for John 
Kerry, the new secretary of state. 
Previous rounds have all faltered because 
neither side was willing to make 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029727 
concessions to the other, and so far there 
is little sign that the United States and the 
P5+1 have improved their offer to Iran 
very much. As the talks were announced, 
the Washington Post reported: The P5+1 
powers have made only mild revisions to 
a proposal that Iran flatly rejected last 
June. Until now, the United States has 
been unwilling to acknowledge Iran's 
right to enrich uranium on its own soil 
and to suggest that some economic 
sanctions might be lifted as part of a deal, 
and Iran has refused to agree even to a 
limited deal called stop, ship, and shut 
— involving the suspension of its 
enrichment to 20 percent purity, shipping 
its existing stockpiles of 20% uranium to 
a third country for processing, and 
shutting down its underground facility at 
Fordo, near Qom — without an agreement 
to lift sanctions. 
After the reelection of Barack Obama in 
November, there were great hopes that 
the president would have greater political 
freedom of offer concessions to Iran. Yet, 
publicly at least, the White House isn't 
signaling that it is ready to make a more 
generous offer to Iran, and in fact Obama 
in January signed into law yet another 
round of draconian economic sanctions. 
Perhaps as a result, Iran allegedly 
dragged its feet on setting a date for talks. 
Despite prodding from the P5+1 — 
including urgent efforts by Russia — in 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029728 
January Iran reportedly went silent about  
talks. Russia, increasingly frustrated by 
the inability of Tehran and the West to 
negotiate seriously, vented its frustration. 
Some of our partners in the six powers 
and the Iranian side cannot come to an 
agreement about where to meet, Russian 
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a  
news conference. We are ready to meet 
at any location as soon as possible. We 
believe the essence of our talks is far 
more important (than the site), and we 
hope that common sense will prevail and 
we will stop behaving like little 
children. 
According to analysts in Washington, 
reinforced by comments from Iran itself, 
a big reason for Tehran's recalcitrance is 
that Iran wants to prove to the United 
States that its vaunted sanctions regime 
will not force Iran to make unilateral 
concessions at the bargaining table. In 
addition, Iran is concerned that it won't 
get much in return in talks with the West, 
and that it will be asked to make 
unilateral concessions on uranium 
enrichment without getting sanctions 
relief in return. Combined with Iranian  
internal divisions, as its own presidential  
election season gets underway, that could 
mean that for the next six months or so 
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei simply won't be 
ready to talk seriously, despite scheduling 
the Kazakhstan round. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029729 
Others suspect that Iran is waiting to see 
how President Obama's new national 
security team — with Kerry as secretary of 
state, Chuck Hagel as secretary of 
defense, and John Brennan at the Central 
Intelligence Agency — will shape 
Obama's stance at any talks. 
In Washington, some would argue there's 
a growing consensus, at the level of think 
tanks, Iran experts, and other analysts, 
that a preliminary, first-round deal, 
including shop, ship, and shut, might 
work, if in response the P5+1 could lift 
some of the economic sanctions on Iran 
and agree to limited Iranian enrichment. 
Perhaps the best-case scenario is the 
possibility that there are ongoing, secret 
and back-channel talks between 
Washington and Tehran. Nothing along 
those lines has leaked and there is no 
indication of this, yet. But in advance of 
the first round of Iran-P5+1 talks in 
Vienna in 2009, the United States and 
Iran did indeed engage in quiet, behind-
the-scenes diplomacy. 
In fact, of course, any sanctions relief for 
Iran will occur slowly and step-by-step, 
not all at once, in parallel with steps 
taken by Iran and openness to more 
intrusive inspections and oversight by the 
IAEA. 
But it's certainly not helpful that in early 
January yet another round of unilateral 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029730 
sanctions was passed by Congress and 
signed into law by President Obama. The 
complex set of new measures targets key 
industrial sectors, including shipping and 
imports of products such as aluminum, 
steel and coal, and seeks to block Iran 
from using barter commodities such as 
oil and gold to pay for imports. The 
Washington Post paraphrased U.S. 
officials as saying that, the new policies 
are closer to a true trade embargo, 
designed to systematically attack and 
undercut Iran's major financial pillars 
and threaten the country with economic 
collapse. Obama signed the National 
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that 
contained the sanctions provisions 
despite having hinted earlier that he 
might veto the NDAA over a host of 
measures contained in the bill. 
If the Obama administration believes that 
ever-tougher sanctions will cause Iran to 
cave in at the talks, it's likely that they 
are badly misreading Iranian politics. 
For many observers, however, and for 
Iran, too, the nomination of Hagel for 
secretary of defense may be a sign that 
the White House is beginning to realize 
that sanctions, and threats of military 
action, won't force Iran's hand. 
As has been widely reported, hawks, 
neoconservatives, and members of the 
pro-Israel lobby in Washington have 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029731 
slammed Hagel for his past comments 
and positions on Iran. In conjunction with 
Israel-friendly members of Congress, 
they've warned Obama to rein Hagel in 
so as not to send a dovish signal to 
Tehran. Robert Satloff, executive 
direction of the Washington Institute for 
Near East Policy (WINEP), a pro-Israel 
think tank, warned bluntly that the White 
House should act quickly to make sure 
that Hagel backs away from his previous 
views on Iran and at least toes the 
administration's tougher line. If the 
White House does not take steps soon to 
correct that impression, the chances for a 
negotiated resolution of the Iran nuclear 
crisis will fall nearly to zero and the 
likelihood of Israeli military action will 
rise dramatically, he wrote. 
Indeed, within days of his nomination as 
secretary of defense, Hagel was already 
backing away from his earlier views, 
meeting with senior Pentagon officials 
and influential senators who'll vote on 
his confirmation to clarify his views on 
Iran, asserting that he supports broad 
international sanctions against Iran and 
that he believes that the military option 
ought to be on the table. Several 
Democratic senators who met with Hagel 
announced with satisfaction that the 
former senator from Nebraska had 
sufficiently backtracked or clarified his 
views on Iran. Consequently, they 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029732 
announced that he had earned their 
support — and their vote. 
Then, during his confirmation hearings 
on January 31, Hagel — under hostile 
questioning from several Republican 
senators — backed away from earlier-held 
positions on Iran, including the role of 
sanctions. And, though he previously 
been a sharp critic of a military attack on 
Iran, in his opening statement Hagel said: 
I am fully committed to the President's 
goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a 
nuclear weapon, and—as I've said in the 
past—all options must be on the table to 
achieve that goal. My policy is one of 
prevention, and not one of containment—
and the President has made clear that is 
the policy of our government. As 
Secretary of Defense, I will make sure 
the Department is prepared for any 
contingency. 
Satloff's views were echoed by another 
tough-talking official at WINEP, former 
Ambassador Dennis Ross, a pro-Israel 
hawk who served as Obama's top adviser 
on Iran during much of the president's 
first term. I think 2013 is going to be 
decisive, Ross told the Los Angeles  
Times, expressing concern about Hagel's 
previous comments. Time really is 
running out. For diplomacy to have a 
chance of success, the Iranians need to 
understand that if diplomacy fails, force 
is going to be the result. We still have a 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029733 
challenge to convince the Iranians that 
we're quite serious about the use of 
force, he said. In the first term, the 
administration didn't always speak with 
one voice on this issue. So what Hagel 
says can make a difference. 
Despite his poorly receieved performance  
at his confirmation hearings, it's widely 
believed in Washington that Hagel will 
be confirmed as secretary of defense and 
that his private advice to Obama will 
more closely hew to his long-held beliefs 
about the futility of sanctions and the 
grave downside to a military strike. Partly 
for that reason, it remains very unlikely 
that the Obama administration will resort 
to force to resolve the dispute with Iran. 
In fact, in remarks that Iranian officials 
cited as promising, Vice President Joe 
Biden expressed the administration's 
willingness to hold bilateral talks with the 
Iranians. In response to a question at the 
Munich Security Conference Biden said, 
We have made it clear at the outset 
that...we would be prepared to meet 
bilaterally with the Iranian leadership 
when Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah 
Ali Khamenei is serious about 
negotiations. Iran's Foreign Minister, Ali 
Akbar Salehi responded favorably and 
said, I am optimistic, I feel this new 
administration is really seeking this time 
to at least divert from its previous 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029734 
traditional approach vis-a-vis my 
country. 
But if Washington remains committed to 
ever-tougher sanctions — and without 
promising Iran that sanctions will be 
lifted as part of a deal — then negotiations 
are unlikely to succeed. Vali Nasr, 
another former Obama administration 
official with expertise on Iran, suggested 
recently that there's not much more the 
world can do to sanction Iran, and that 
such penalties could drive Tehran to take 
radical action. The regime of sanctions 
against Iran over its nuclear activity 
really has reached its end, Nasr, dean of 
the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced 
International Studies at Johns Hopkins 
University, said during the World 
Economic Forum in Davos. And he 
warned that unless there is a diplomatic 
breakthrough — or, alternatively, an 
attack on Iran — you really are looking 
at a scenario where Iran is going to rush 
very quickly towards nuclear power, 
because they also think, like North 
Korea, that (then) you have much more 
leverage to get rid of these sanctions.

Article 7. 
The Wall Street Journal 
A New U.S. International 
Economic Strategy  
Robert B. Zoellick 
February 5, 2013 -- Five years into the 
global economic storm, America's 
traditional allies, theEuropean Union and 
Japan, are struggling. Developing 
economies are reshaping the global 
dynamic but also face big challenges. The 
United States is the one country that 
could lead the modernization of the 
international system so as to supply 
security, economic opportunity, and 
prospects for liberty. America's own 
strategy for economic revival cannot be 
limited to the nation's borders. And its 
future foreign policy—its projection of 
power and principle—must be grounded 
in the emerging economic order. 
President Obama has said he admires 
Ronald Reagan's transformative thinking. 
If so, he should ask for an assessment of 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029736 
Reagan's second-term innovations on 
currency and monetary affairs, trade, debt 
and development. Reagan advanced a 
new international system to match the 
revival of capitalism after the oil shocks 
and stagflation of the 1970s. America's 
success in the 1980s contributed both to 
the end of the Cold War, by persuading 
the Soviet Union it could not keep up, 
and to two decades of exceptional global 
growth. 
The new U.S. international economic 
strategy should have five parts. First, this 
country should strengthen its continental 
base by building on the North American 
Free Trade Agreement with Canada and 
Mexico. Together, the three partners 
could boost energy security, improve 
productivity, and give North Americans 
an edge in manufacturing and other 
industries that are already experiencing 
rising wages in East Asia. A politically 
acceptable immigration policy, and a 
push for educational innovation using 
new technologies and competition, could 
lead to a more prosperous, populous, 
integrated and democratic future for the 
hemisphere. 
Second, the extraordinary monetary 
policies of late, led by the Federal 
Reserve's continued near-zero interest-
rate policy, are taking us into uncharted 
territory. Central banks have tried most 
every tool to stimulate growth; if Japan is 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029737 
any warning, the next tactic is 
competitive devaluation, which risks a 
new protectionism. Currency 
manipulation could become a danger 
that reaches far beyond the debate about 
Chinese policies. The world economy 
will need at some point to withdraw the 
drug of cheap money and negative real 
interest rates. The U.S. should anticipate 
these dangers. 
The International Monetary Fund also 
could help set standards about exchange-
rate policies and serve as a referee that 
blows a whistle, even if it cannot 
penalize. The IMF and the World Trade 
Organization should anticipate this risk 
and give effect to the existing WTO 
agreement that economies must avoid 
manipulating exchange rates . . . to gain 
an unfair competitive advantage. 
Third, the U.S. needs to break the logjam 
on opening markets. As the leading world 
economy, America should initially try to 
strengthen and increase international 
trade through the WTO. As my 
colleagues at the Peterson Institute have 
pointed out, there are gains from the 
stymied Doha Round of trade 
negotiations that should be harvested 
now: ending agricultural export 
subsidies; limiting food export controls; 
eliminating tariffs and quotas for almost 
all exports of the poorest countries; 
facilitating customs and clearance 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029738 
procedures; and improving the 
transparency and speed of the system for 
settling disputes. 
Next, the U.S. needs to keep the WTO 
current with a vastly changed world 
economy. The past WTO agreements are 
valuable for all 158 WTO members. But 
some economies want to go further by 
reducing barriers in important sectors 
such as the services trade, environmental 
goods and services, government 
procurement, and the digital economy. 
The services trade, for example, is vital 
for boosting innovation, productivity and 
jobs in developing and developed 
countries alike—but regulatory, 
licensing, zoning and other barriers to 
services are often equivalent to a 30% 
tariff or higher. Because liberalization in 
the WTO has been stuck, countries have 
turned increasingly to bilateral and 
multilateral free-trade agreements, some 
of which have addressed these newer 
topics. The U.S. should foster the WTO 
principle of world-wide liberalization by 
adopting standards in various industries 
and sectors that would be open to all 
economies that reciprocate. The WTO 
also needs new rules for fair trading by 
state-owned enterprises. 
Yet the U.S. also should use free-trade 
agreements to open markets. Trade 
competition advances structural reforms 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029739 
and growth without bigger government 
and more spending. The Obama 
administration has talked about trans-
Pacific and trans-Atlantic accords. Yet it 
has failed to close even one new free-
trade agreement. Ron Kirk, the 
president's trade representative, said in 
2009 that the administration did not have 
deal fever. In fact, it has been deal 
delinquent. 
Fourth, gender equality is not only fair 
and right—it is smart economics. No 
economy can reach its potential if it 
overlooks the talents of half its people. 
The U.S. should lead in identifying 
structural barriers in countries that hold 
back girls' and women's health, 
education, credit, jobs and 
entrepreneurship. 
Finally, the U.S. needs to match growth 
priorities of developing economies. 
President Obama should expand the 
global food-security initiative he 
announced in 2009 to boost agricultural 
productivity and production across the 
value chain, including through the private 
sector, in sub-Saharan Africa and other 
poor regions. Infrastructure investment 
could increase global demand today 
while building productivity for tomorrow. 
The U.S. can lead a push with middle-
income economies to develop public-
private infrastructure models that move 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029740 
from one-offs to a deal flow. The zero 
returns for savers from U.S. monetary 
policy can make infrastructure 
investments attractive. 
In addition to offering financing, the 
private sector can improve the design, 
operation and maintenance of 
infrastructure. As the state of Indiana has 
shown, the federal government could 
profitably use public-private partnerships 
for its infrastructure, too. 
The administration has talked about some 
of these topics. But it is oddly passive, as 
if it were hesitant to lead. State 
Department speeches are not enough. To 
carve out an international economic 
strategy, the new secretary of the 
Treasury needs to choreograph policies 
across all U.S. departments and with 
multilateral economic institutions. The 
U.S. had better wake up: International 
economic strategy is the new foreign 
policy. 
Mr. Zoellick has served as president of 
the World Bank Group, U.S. trade 
representative and deputy secretary of 
state. He is now a fellow at the Belfer 
Center at Harvard and the Peterson 
Institute for International Economics.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018529.txt,"women never have our own damn sexual needs; that it's wrong or wicked or dirty for
women to negotiate any sexual exchange for pleasure; that women are meant to trade sex
for commitment or support (though, bizarrely, never outright for money). If we
assume that I can get something great from sexual relationships without Being On The
Path To Marriage. That I understand and honor my sexual desires, that those desires are
worth fulfilling in themselves. And if we assume that men have something wonderful
they could bring to the sexual exchange; that they aren't always using or exploiting or
winning some kind of sick war-of-the-sexes, every single time they fuck.

But even if the fears don't make sense, sometimes they still come out and whisper at the
back of my neck... /'m selling myself short. As if I should have bargained better, should
have traded my sexuality for far more than mere pleasure with someone I merely
liked, was merely attracted to, who merely respected my boundaries and merely
was fun to hang out with. Would some people see it as ironic that I prefer relationships
with real emotional heft, even when short-term or casual? Even with that said, though,
there is no description of how reasonable, safe, or awesome my relationships are that will
matter to our slut-shaming society -- or to the fears it's hammered into me. Society,
whose judgment of whether a girl is a slut can be sudden and devastating, stupid and
stereotypical; a lightning strike that lands based on absurd factors like how non-
normative or straightforward or aware of her sexuality she is. And once I'm a slut -- if]
dare dance over that ever-shifting line -- then I'm beyond the pale. The world always
seems to be outdoing itself in finding new ways to tell me that once I'm a slut, no man
will ever respect me again.

TK OK ok

I went home. It was raining, all across my cypress city; raining so hard, I had to take the
bus instead of walking. The rain struck me as an insultingly obvious metaphor, as did the
fact that I was scheduled to attend a wedding that afternoon. It seemed strange that
hallucinatory San Francisco would throw such tired tropes at me. (I should have trusted
the city more. It was with me, still.)

I was sad. Not devastated. Just sad, and a little bit scared. /'m such a screwed-up
perverted slut, no man will ever care about me. However, I'm an adult, so I tried to
recognize my emotional baggage, give myself some time to process, then eat a proper
lunch and get some work done.

I took a very dear, very blunt friend out to dinner recently. (Yes, I paid, and yes, he felt
objectified.) Over Indian curries, I tried to explain my fears that All Men (who are of
course a monolith) will pigeonhole me as too much, too extreme. A slut. Whatever.
My friend listened, savoring his delicious lassi as he thought about what I was trying to
say. Then he said, Look, you shouldn't worry about it. You're extreme. You're also tall.
You couldn't be un-tall for a man, and you can't be un-extreme. There are men who will
like you just fine for it, so just keep an eye out for those men.” I could detect the edge
under his words: Come on, Clarisse, you're the one who always says that People Are
Different, why do I even have to tell you this? A fair point, but I can't help it -- stories like
this still shake me.

As it happens, though, this story has a happy ending.

Thomas E. Scott, Jr., Esq.

Re: Edwards and Cassell v. Dershowitz
February 25, 2015

Page 4

WL 1328259, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (“Courts have long construed the term ‘control’ as
meaning more than simple ‘possession.’ 'Control has been construed broadly by the
courts as the legal right, authority, or practical ability to obtain the materials sought
upon demand.). See also Frantz v, Golebiewski, 407 So.2d 283, 285 n.4 (Fla. 3 DCA
1981) (Interpretations of the federal rule are persuasive in considering its Florida
equivalent.).

While your responses purport to recognize the obligation to produce documents subject

to Mr. Dershowitz’s “control”, there are qualifications in the responses that would

appear to contradict that recognition. Your objection to the production of metadata has
_no legal foundation.

Word Play and Gamesmanship

You will note that we do not include page after page of definitions. I believe that any
lawyer reasonably fluent in English can carry out his or her duty to construe
interrogatories and requests for production in the broad and liberal manner intended by
the rules. Florida courts frown on parsing and gamesmanship. See, e.g. First Healthcare
Corp. v. Hamilton, 740 So.2d 1189, 1194 (Fla. 4 DCA 1999) (chastising counsel who
did not turn over event reports because plaintiff requested incident reports as
engaged in little more than a semantic shell game.).

Repeated assertions that statements were made by Mr. Dershowitz “upon information
and belief” is an example of prohibited “word play.” That qualification has no bearing
on the Defendant’s discovery obligations.

“Will Produce”

The Rules of Civil Procedure require production and not just a commitment of
production at some unspecified future date. If the documents you intend to produce are
available for inspection and copying now as they are required to be, we are prepared to
pick them up immediately. If they are not immediately available, when will they be?

Timeframe Objections

Your repeated attempts to restrict discovery to a narrow timeframe, fail to account for
the fact that this is a defamation action arising out of broad defamatory statements made
by Mr. Dershowitz impugning the honesty and integrity of the Plaintiffs without any
limitations as to a specific time or circumstance. Mr. Dershowitz has also made broad
public denials of misconduct unrestricted to any specific timeframe. We are entitled to

other whistle-blowers who uncovered what they considered gov-
ernment malfeasance by virtue of their jobs, Snowden, by his own
admission, took a new job in 2013 specifically to get access to the SCI
files concerning NSA sources that he stole from the Threat Opera-
tions Center. Switching jobs in order to widen one’s access to state
secrets is an activity usually associated with penetration agents, not
whistle-blowers. While the technical distinction between a whistle-
blower and a spy may still serve the media in the case of Snowden,
it does not help in solving the counterintelligence conundrum. A
complex theft of state secrets had been successfully carried out in
a supposedly secure site. The only known witness, Snowden, had
escaped to Russia, where he could be of no help in reconstructing the
crime for American intelligence agencies. The stolen data was kept
in the equivalent of sealed “vaults”—actually computer drives that
were not connected to the NSA network. If ever there was a locked-
room mystery, this was it.

According to the FBI investigation, Snowden pierced these barri-
ers by using passwords that belonged to other people and using cre-

© dentials that allowed him to masquerade as a system administrator. ©
It was a feat that must have required meticulous planning.

To address such a mystery, a counterintelligence investigation
starts with a tabula rasa, stripping away all the previous assump-
tions, including that Snowden was the lone perpetrator. It builds
alternative scenarios to test against the known facts. To be sure, sce-
nario building differs from that of a conventional forensic investiga-
tion aimed at finding pieces of evidence that can be used to persuade
a jury in a courtroom. Unlike a judicial investigation concerned with
guilt and innocence, scenario building looks to develop a story that
is, concurrently, intrinsically consistent and humanly plausible, and
in the process it also identifies and explores the possible holes in the
case.

“Scenarios deal with two worlds: the world of facts and the world
of perceptions. They explore for facts but they aim at perceptions
inside the heads of decision makers. Their purpose is to gather and
transform information of strategic significance into fresh percep-
tions,” wrote Pierre Wack in the Harvard Business Review in 1985.
Such scenarios must aim at constituting a limited set of mutually

The Department of Justice lost its latest battle with Congress Thursday when it agreed to brief House
Intelligence Committee members about a top-secret intelligence source that was part of the FBI’s
investigation of the Trump campaign. Even without official confirmation of that source’s name, the news so

far holds some stunning implications.

Among them is that the Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation outright hid critical
information from a congressional investigation. In a Thursday press conference, Speaker Paul Ryan bluntly
noted that Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes’s request for details on this secret source was “wholly

99 66

appropriate,” “completely within the scope” of the committee’s long-running FBI investigation, and
“something that probably should have been answered a while ago.” Translation: The department knew full
well it should have turned this material over to congressional investigators last year, but instead deliberately

concealed it.

House investigators nonetheless sniffed out a name, and Mr. Nunes in recent weeks issued a letter and a
subpoena demanding more details. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s response was to double
down—accusing the House of “extortion” and delivering a speech in which he claimed that “declining to
open the FBI’s files to review” is a constitutional “duty.” Justice asked the White House to back its
stonewall. And it even began spinning that daddy of all superspook arguments—that revealing any detail

about this particular asset could result in “loss of human lives.”

This is desperation, and it strongly suggests that whatever is in these files is going to prove very

uncomfortable to the FBI.

was coping in his trademark military uniform. Still, the mood music going into the
meeting was encouraging. After the election, Arafat had tried to use his ties with
the ayatollahs in Iran to get them to release 13 members of the tiny Jewish
community in Shiraz who had been jailed on patently absurd accusations of spying
for the “Zionist régime.” Iran had told him no. Given its support for Hizbollah, and
its serial diatribes about destroying the State of Israel, this was hardly a surprise.
But it was a gesture nonetheless, and I told him I appreciated it. I also arrived with
a gift: a leather-bound volume with both the Hebrew Bible and Koran. I began our
meeting with what I felt I most needed him to hear: that both of us were trying to
achieve something hugely important, nothing less than a new relationship between
Israelis and Palestinians based on trust. As I would discover in the months ahead —
as Yitzhak had found as well — Arafat responded warmly to such general appeals
of principle. He replied that he viewed me as a partner, and a friend. But the key
issue of substance — the difference between how I envisaged taking Oslo forward
and what he wanted — was impossible to avoid.

I emphasized that I was committed to the further Wye River summit
redeployments Bibi which had agreed, although not implemented, as well as to a
release of Palestinian prisoners agreed at Wye. Yet then came the more difficult
part: explaining my view of how we could best move toward a full peace
agreement. I said I was convinced the prospects would be much better if we
delayed the redeployments and brought forward the start of the real negotiations:
on “permanent-status” issues like final borders, settlements, Jerusalem, refugees. In
any case, I said, I’'d need a few months for a thorough assessment of the issues
involved, and to reach a settled view with my negotiating team on how to proceed.
Arafat seemed to accept the idea of a pause for reflection and planning. But he held
firm in his opposition to any further delay in the Wye redeployments. More
worryingly for the longer-term prospects of an agreement, he ignored altogether
my suggestion that we move ahead toward the permanent-status talks.

Speaking to reporters, I was careful to accentuate the positive. I said the reason
I’d come to see Arafat so soon was because of the importance I attached to his role
in “shaping peace in the Middle East.” I said I would not waver in continuing on
the path which Rabin and he and begun. And while the security of Israel would be
my paramount concern in negotiations, “I also want each Palestinian to feel
secure.” Both sides, I said, had suffered enough. The open question, however, was
whether / had done enough to persuade Arafat that his exclusive focus on

The brothers had never had a “home father.” They referred to Gary as their “prison father,” since
he had spent most of his adult life behind bars, having been convicted of armed robbery and other
predatory crimes.

On the way back to prison from a court appearance, Gary had overpowered the guard, killed him,
took his gun and escaped. He was soon recaptured, sentenced to life imprisonment and soon
began to plan his next escape—this time across the border to Mexico, which was only a two hour
drive from the prison.

Before he could escape, Gary had to get himself removed from the “escape risk” list and
maximum security—to establish a sense of trust in him by the prison officials. When some young
prisoners acted up, Gary worked with the prison officials and helped to control them. He worked
on the newspaper, television, and entertainment committee, earning him the right to have visits
with his family in the outdoor recreation area. Gary used his time with his family to persuade
them to help him escape. After much prodding, the boys agreed.

On a summer visiting day in July of 1978, the three Tison brothers arrived at the Florence State
Prison with their perennial picnic basket. Beneath the fried chicken were pistols and shotguns.

The boys had arranged for a car to be parked in the lot of the local hospital. They knew there
could be shooting. But Gary promised them that nobody would get hurt. “The more firepower
you have,” he instructed them, “the less likely you’ll have to use it.”

“We told Dad,” Raymond later said, “we’ll do this on one condition—that no one gets hurt.”

Gary assured the boys, “We'll make it out without firing a shot or being fired at. And once
outside, it will be clear sailing. I know how it works. I’ve been there before.” He had been there
before, but it hadn’t worked. He had killed a guard and been recaptured.

To the three boys, their father wasn’t a killer. A guard had been accidentally shot in a scuffle. It
was not in cold blood. Their father was incapable of that. Gary told them that his criminal
conduct had been a result of secret training he had received in the “Service.” It was “top secret.”
They believed this fantasy like they believed everything else their father told them. “Nobody was
going to get shot,” their father assured them.

Gary’s prediction proved to be correct about the escape. Raymond went to meet his father in the
picnic area. His brothers Ricky and Donny went into the waiting room with their picnic basket.
A friend of Gary’s, Randy Greenawalt—also a convicted murderer—was in an adjoining control
room. When the other visitors had left, the boys pulled out their shotguns and held the guards at
bay. Raymond and Gary joined them.

When additional guards appeared they were first ordered to lie down and then herded into a
storage room. The door was locked and the power turned off. Then the five simply walked out
the front door. Not a shot had been fired.

continuous process” designed to maintain that sense, if not illusion, of control. We natural ly think that our
thinking and feeling processes are passive; that they just happen. Yet when faced with truly frightening
prospects, the mind is geared to actively distort.

Similarly, the sense of control must be continuously maintained so the Control Factor operates constantly. In
turn, the sum of this active and continuous undertaking makes these perceptions all the more familiar and
thus seemingly all the more “real.” In one sense, the Control Factor is the mechanism of what Andy
McCarthy entitled one of his numerous excellent books- willful blindness. The Control Factor is cleverer
than we are aware; that is almost tautological as, if our minds are to create ways to keep us in denial, they
must out maneuver our conscious thinking.

Since World War II, America has had limited experience with threats coming to the homeland. Most of
America’s history has been about “over there,” where we have always known that if things got too out of
hand (e.g. Vietnam) we could always ret urn home. The current generations, for a wide array of reasons,
have had virtually no experience with a threat to this land. (The documentary, Generation Zero, is interesting
on this point).

Consequently, the process of waking up to such a threat parallels the arc of a typical horror film. In such a
film, there is typically a cast of characters surrounding one or two main characters. We in the audience know
there is a threat coming — be it a monster, a virus, a psycho killer, an alien, the blob that ate Cincinnati etc.
This threat is typically defined by its intent- the singular goal of destroying the characters. Much of the initial
exposition shows how the characters first are oblivious to the destruction the threat brings about, then explain
it in familiar terms only to finally open their eyes to see that something uniquely terrifying is happening. The
next stage usually involves a series of failed attempts to deal with the threat- fr om trying to negotiate with it,
to appease it, to coax it, to threaten it with ineffective weapons and so forth. Most of these failings are due to
not adequately appreciating the threat for what it truly is and projecting onto it a host of other attributes
instead. The final stage generally involves a back-up-against-the-wall decision by whichever characters
remain alive. I named this the “turnaround moment” when the character becomes willing to be as ruthless as
the threat. That change in mental state is necessary to ensure survival. Ultimately, the storyline is a race for
whichever characters remain to wake up fully and use whatever advantages they may still have to beat the
threat.

This is the same arc our minds go through in battling our own Control Factors, our own compulsions to deny
that which is staring us in the face. Ultimately, the question is whether we will be able to wake up while we
still have advantages and give ourselves permis sion to fully fight the battle we are in.

I said ear lier that there is a structure to the Control Factor. To oversimplify, I view it much as a pyramid
where on the bottom are the many minute by minute thoughts that are manipulated. I call this level of
maneuvers the many ”D’s” as they include the psychological defenses such as distortion, denial,
demonization, deflection, deletion, detachment, delusion, displacement, discolorization and so forth. Layered
upon these are moves such as projection, where we can assign to our Islamic Enemy traits we wish to see in
them or introject traits from them into ourselves that we wish not to acknowledge. These maneuvers involve
a mixing of identities where we actually lose clarity about who we are and who the enemy is. Projection and
introjection are active almost across the board. It is always helpful, for instance, to ask how what the enemy
accuses us of is more appropriately descriptive of it. When we add Western Guilt and Shame, our need to be
liked, and o ther psychological dimensions, basic thoughts solidify into larger fantasies.

As these narratives (“Our courts will never allow that,” “As a superpower we will always be able to win any
fight we put our minds to,” “Assimilation will ensure Muslims are westernized” ...) gain consent from others
they tend to guide us deeply and become infused on our policies. Ultimately, what emerges is a relationship
we take with our Islamic Enemy that parallels that between an addict and an enabler. Emblematic of this
relationship is the “transfer of responsibility” in which we assume responsibility for the enemy’s behavior
who is addicted to transferring it away from itself. The Control Factor actively maintains this relationship
and makes changing that relationship as difficult a chore as any addict finds in breaking his addiction. And

“Exporting” Corrupt or Unethical Business Practices

China scores poorly on international indices of corruption.*° As Chinese companies

expand abroad, it is possible that they could have a deleterious effect simply by exporting
suspect business practices. An industry of particular importance is banking. The “big four”
Chinese banks all operate in the United States, where their assets have increased sevenfold
between 2010 and 2016 to $126.5 billion.” They are often extensively involved in real estate
transactions of Chinese firms operating in the United States. In 2015, 2016, and 2018, China
Construction Bank,** the Agricultural Bank of China, and Industrial & Commercial Bank
of China*® were respectively subject to enforcement action by the Federal Reserve for not
doing enough to fight money laundering.

Chinese corporations in the United States can also hinder the rule of law in other ways.
When responding to lawsuits in US courts, Chinese state-owned enterprises have claimed
exemption due to sovereign immunity; in other instances, Chinese firms with an American
legal presence have refused to comply with US investigations by claiming that cooperation
would violate Chinese law.*' These actions inhibit the ability of the US government to
regulate commerce and put American competitors at a disadvantage within their own
country.

Chinese Manipulation of American Companies as a Vector of Influence”

American companies play a significant role in American foreign and domestic politics and
their leaders regularly are selected to take positions of leadership in government. As a result,
corporate America’s traditional role in favor of engagement with China, given the country’s
market potential, has had significant weight in American policy toward the country.”
China, for its part, welcomed foreign companies’ investment as part of its policy of reform
and opening up in the hope of spurring economic development.

China’s relationship with corporate America has become increasingly fraught. In this report
and elsewhere, China’s state-directed efforts to facilitate the theft of intellectual property,
the lifeblood of developed economies, are well documented. China’s forced transfer of
technology by foreign firms, as a condition of operating in China, is one of the main
complaints of both the Trump administration and the European Union.

But China’s ability to pressure US companies also encompasses three other more elusive
dimensions. First, recognizing the importance of American companies in American
politics, China has frequently cultivated, even leveraged, American executives to

lobby against policies it opposes. Where cultivation fails, it has threatened or exercised

Amounts include restricted stock units and Class B Units. The number of shares and values were determined based on the closing price of Carvana
Co.’s Class A common stock on each vesting date and, in the case of Class B Units, the applicable participation thresholds of our B1 Units, B2 Units,
B3 Units, and B4 Units (all as defined above in the “Outstanding Equity Awards at 2018 Fiscal Year End” table).

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON A CHANGE OF CONTROL

As described in “Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Termination, Severance, and Change of Control Benefits” above, we do not have an
employment or severance agreement with any of our named executives; however, our NEOs would be entitled to accelerated vesting of certain equity
awards under the following conditions, with values listed as of December 31, 2018:

Amounts in this column represent the market value as of December 31, 2018, on a fully exchanged basis, of the Class B Units, described above under
“Outstanding Equity Awards at 2018 Fiscal Year End,” that would vest upon a change of control of Carvana Group, as long as the executive’s
employment had not been previously terminated and subject to certain escrow demand rights held by a purchaser of control of Carvana Group. The
performance-contingent RSUs would also vest on a change of control, but in proportion to the progress made toward positive EBITDA. None of the
performance-contingent restricted stock units would be subject to accelerated vesting as of December 31, 2018, because EBITDA as of that date had

not progressed beyond the baseline.

Amounts in this column represent the market value as of December 31, 2018, of all outstanding time-based RSUs, which would become fully vested
if the executive is involuntarily terminated without cause within 24 months of a change of control of Carvana Co. In that event, outstanding unvested
stock options would also become fully vested and exercisable, but as of December 31, 2018, the price of Carvana’s Class A common stock did not

exceed the strike price of those unvested options.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017535.txt,"When Mark Cuban purchased the Dallas Mavericks on
January 14, 2000, the face of the organization began to
change immediately. Once again Mavericks games had
a party atmosphere as Reunion Arena rocked with the
return of the “Reunion Rowdies.” Mavericks games
became more than just ordinary NBA games—

they were a total entertainment experience.

Cuban was not only successful at instilling a sense
of pride and passion into Mavericks fans by presenting himself
as the ultimate role model by cheering from the same seats he
had in years past, but he also became the first owner in team
sports to encourage fan interaction through e-mail on his
personal computer. It was through this personal touch that
fans throughout the Metroplex, and around the world, began
to notice Cuban’s energetic personality and take notice of
the Mavericks. He has personally responded to thousands
of emails, and several suggestions from fans have led to
innovative changes such as a new three-sided shot clock,
which allows line of site to the 24-second clock from
anywhere in the arena.

Cuban’s whatever-it-takes attitude and commitment
to winning has everyone’s attention. From his first introduction
to the team to the end of his first season as owner, the players
responded with a 31-19 record, including a 9-1 mark in April
2000. In addition to hiring special coaches for offense,
defense and shooting, Cuban has promised to do everything
in his power to improve the team. This goal was achieved as
the club finished the 2000-01 season with a 53-29 record en
route to their first playoff appearance in 11 years where they
became just the sixth team in NBA history to be down o-2 and
come back to win a five-game series vs. Utah in Round 1.

Before the start of the 2001-02 season, American
Airlines Center, the Mavs new home, opened and Cuban
co-founded HDNet, an all high-definition television network
on DIRECTV channel 199 which launched in September
2001. As with his other ventures, Cuban is revolutionizing
the television industry with HDNet. He is planning to expand
HDNet to include three more networks showing high-def
sports, movies and entertainment by the end of 2002.

During the Mavs 2001-02 campaign, the team
continued their winning ways by finishing the season with
a franchise-best record of 57-25 and an NBA-best road
record of 27-14, advancing to the postseason for the
second-consecutive year.

Prior to his purchase of the Mavericks, Cuban co-
founded Broadcast.com, the leading provider of multimedia
and streaming on the Internet, in 1995, selling it to Yahoo!
in July of 1999. Before Broadcast.com, Cuban co-founded
MicroSolutions, a leading National Systems Integrator,
in 1983, and later sold it to CompuServe.

Today, in addition to his ownership of the Mavericks,
Cuban is an active investor in leading and cutting-edge
technologies and continues to be a sought-after speaker.

CHAPTER I2

Alison: September 11, 2005

t might start with the Palm Beach Daily News, which usually
covers charity balls, equestrian events, and gallery openings.
Reporters there would kill to sink their teeth into something
so juicy. On top of that, Chief Reiter knows, Palm Beach is full of
freelance paparazzi and seasoned semiretired journalists.
: 4 They'd kill for the story, too. For them, it'd be a real-life Body
Heat.
f Over at WPTV, the local NBC affiliate, the phone rings
one day.
It's a tip from a kid, sounding nervous. Something about girls
from a local high school.
There's a prostitution ring out in Palm Beach, says the boy.
] a The tip gets brought up in a midmorning meeting at which
the producers divvy up ideas among the various reporters and
newscasts.

I have the same ones (through Bill). 
I also got two additional for you but it turns out that they are not the same level so I reached to Kevin for help. 
The price is 2,500Euro per ticket (this is very reduced price as I think the regular one for this is 15K and it is

Prince Andrew had sexually abused Virginia Roberts,

correct?

A. That was one of the allegations in here,
sure.

Q. And the allegations that Professor Dershowitz
had sexually abused Virginia Roberts, correct?

A. That's right. It was in a -- what we were --
what we were starting to document and allege here was
that terrible things that Epstein's criminal
organization had done.

Q. Let me refer you to page 6 --

A. Okay.

Q.  -- of your filing. It's the first full
paragraph.

A. Yep.

Q. I'm going to read it. Epstein also
trafficked Jane Doe Number 3 for sexual purposes to many
other powerful men.”

A. Okay.

Q. Including numerous prominent American
politicians, powerful business executives, foreign
presidents, a well-known prime minister, and other world
leaders. Jane -- Epstein required Jane Doe Number 3 to
describe the events that she had with these men so that
he could potentially blackmail them.

ESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS

291
Did I read that correctly?

A. You did.

Q. With respect to blackmail, the ability to
blackmail, is that the same potential we talked about a
moment ago in your testimony?

A. Sure.

Q. And you're referring there to --

A. Roughly, yeah. I mean, if there's something
that you want clarified, go ahead and clarify it.

Q. I just -- I just wanted to make sure I
understand correctly that when you refer that -- to
Epstein requiring Virginia Roberts to describe these
events so that he could potentially blackmail them, what
you had in mind was, Epstein wanted to know what
Virginia Roberts did with these men so that he had the
ability to threaten to disclose it if they didn’t do
what he wanted them to do?

A. That was -- that was part of it, yes.

Q. And isn't it true you could have
accomplished -- in terms of furthering Virginia
Roberts's legal interests, you could have accomplished
exactly the same thing by saying Epstein also
trafficked ~- trafficked Jane Doe Number 3 for sexual
purposes to other well-known men, period?

A. No, I don't think so.

the beach. A sad thing, but something that does happen from
time to time. His homeland, Haiti, is desperately poor. Run by
despots who line their pockets while everyday people suffer.

Many of the refugees are illiterate.

Most of them speak only Creole.

“Eske ou ka ede nou, souple,” they ask.

“Can you help us, please?”

The cops always need a translator, and Noel’s been asked to
help out before. But this time the police officer’s voice is raspy,
impatient.

“This time is different,” the officer says. “Something very
special. You don’t have to accept. But if you do, you'll have to
keep things to yourself, completely.”

When he hears what the story is, Noel accepts.

“Tll do it,” he says immediately.

The address he’s been given is 358 El Brillo Way. On his first
morning, St. Pierre moves swiftly, sneaking a glance through the
kitchen window at the four silhouettes standing inside. Three
women, one of them quite short, with pigtails.

The fourth silhouette is that of a tall man.

The police have given him clear instructions. The work is
unsavory, but so is the work Noel does every day. What the
detectives want from him now are slips of paper with phone
numbers, along with toothbrushes, condoms, discarded under-
wear. Anything that could provide DNA. He’s been told to use a
special truck on the El Brillo run. Whatever he finds he’s to put
aside in small trash bags he'll deliver directly to the station at the
end of every shift.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013108.txt,"192 11 Stages of Cognitive Development

Finally, another limiting aspect of Piaget’s model is that it did not recognize any stages
beyond formal operations, and included no provisions for exploring this possibility. A mumber of
researchers [Bic88, Arl75, CRK82, Rie73, Mar01| have described one or more postformal stages.
Commons and colleagues have also proposed a task-based model which provides a framework for
explaining stage discrepancies across tasks and for generating new stages based on classification
of observed logical behaviors. [K1<90] promotes a statistical conception of stage, which provides a
good bridge between task-based and stage-based models of development, as statistical modeling
allows for stages to be roughly defined and analyzed based on collections of task behaviors.

[CRK&82] postulates the existence of a postformal stage by observing elevated levels of abstrac-
tion which, they argue, are not manifested in formal thought. [CTS~ 98] observes a postformal
stage when subjects become capable of analyzing and coordinating complex logical systems
with each other, creating metatheoretical supersystems. In our model, with the reflexive stage
of development, we expand this definition of metasystemic thinking to include the ability to
consciously refine one’s own mental states and formalisms of thinking. Such self-reflexive re-
finement is necessary for learning which would allow a mind to analytically devise entirely new
structures and methodologies for both formal and postformal thinking.

In spite of these various critiques and limitations, however, we have found Piaget’s ideas
very useful, and in Section 11.4 we will explore ways of defining them rigorously in the specific
context of CogPrime’s declarative knowledge store and probabilistic logic engine.

11.3.1 Perry’s Stages

Also relevant is William Perry’s [Per70, Per81] theory of the stages (“positions” in his terminol-
ogy) of intellectual and ethical development, which constitutes a model of iterative refinement
of approach in the developmental process of coming to intellectual and ethical maturity. These
stages, depicted in Table 11.2 form an analytical tool for discerning the modality of belief of
an intelligence by describing common cognitive approaches to handling the complexities of real
world ethical considerations.

11.3.2 Keeping Continuity in Mind

Continuity of mental stages, and the fact that a mind may appear to be in multiple stages
of development simultaneously (depending upon the tasks being tested), are crucial to our
theoretical formulations and we will touch upon them again here. Piaget attempted to address
continuity with the creation of transitional “half stages”. We prefer to observe that each stage
feeds into the other and the end of one stage and the beginning of the next blend together.

The distinction between formal and post-formal, for example, seems to “merely” be the
application of formal thought to oneself. However, the distinction between concrete and formal is
“merely” the buildup to higher levels of complexity of the classification, task decomposition, and
abstraction capabilities of the concrete stage. The stages represent general trends in ability on
a continuous curve of development, not discrete states of mind which are jumped-into quantum
style after enough “knowledge energy” builds-up to cause the transition.

comes to trial,” he said.

He nevertheless convinced Krischer that the girls would not be credible on the
witness stand, according to Reiter and Recarey.

The defense team’s investigators compiled dossiers on the victims in an effort to
show that Epstein’s accusers had troubled pasts.

Dershowitz met with Krischer and Recarey, sharing with them the results of an
investigation into one of the girls, described by Dershowitz as “an accomplished

drama student” who hurled profanities at his investigator at “a furious pace.”

TOLLESON, AZ INSPECTION AND RECONDITIONING CENTER LEASE

In December 2016, we entered into a lease agreement with Verde Investments Inc. (“Verde”), an affiliate of DriveTime, for an IRC in Tolleson,
Arizona. The lease commenced in February, 2017. In August 2018, we entered into an additional lease agreement with a coterminous initial term with
Verde for contiguous space to use in connection with such center, which began that same month. The leases expire in December 2031 subject to our right to
extend for four 5-year terms. Pursuant to the leases, we pay an initial base rent of $137.5 thousand per month, which is adjusted each year beginning on
January 1, 2018, and $57.1 thousand per month, which is adjusted each year beginning on January 1, 2020, respectively, each in accordance with the
Consumer Price Index, subject to a minimum increase of 2% per year and a maximum increase of 5% per year. Total expense related to these lease
agreements was approximately $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

WINDER, GA INSPECTION AND RECONDITIONING CENTER LEASE

In February 2017, we entered into a lease with DriveTime for an IRC in Winder, Georgia where we have maintained partial occupancy
previously under the DriveTime lease agreement described above. We are now the sole occupant. The lease has an 8-year term, subject to our ability to
exercise three renewal option terms of five years each. We began paying base rent of $83.3 thousand per month as of March 1, 2017. The monthly rent is
subject to adjustment each year beginning January 1, 2018, increasing in an amount equal to the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index, with a
maximum of 5% and a minimum of 2%. The monthly rent increased on January 1, 2018, to $85.1 thousand. Our total expenses related to this lease
agreement were approximately $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

HUB LEASE AGREEMENT

In March 2017, we entered into a lease with DriveTime that governs our utilization of office space and parking spaces at retail facilities that we
use as hubs. The lease was most recently amended in December 2018. Under the lease agreement, we pay a monthly rental fee related to our pro rata
utilization of space at such facilities plus a pro rata share of each facility’s actual insurance costs and real estate taxes. Each hub has an initial cancellable
term of two years, subject to certain two consecutive one-year renewal options. Our total expenses related to this lease agreement were approximately
$0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

MR. GOLDBERGER: Right.

MR. NURIK: And that's a whole procedure,
it's not normal circumstances that we are dealing
with.

MR. GOLDBERGER: If time becomes an issue,
we'll approach you and ask you to expedite.

MR. SCAROLA: Mark, ] will tell that from
our perspective time is an issue.

MR. NURIK: Have at it then, Jack. Do what
you need to do to get it done.

MR. SCAROLA: There is a long pending
motion for summary judgment on Brad’s behalf that has
been delayed for purposes of taking this deposition.
We are very anxious to be able to call that motion
for summary judgment up for hearing, so whatever can
be done reasonably to expedite the preparation of
this portion of this transcript would be appreciated.

We understand there are limitations beyond your
control, but to the extent you can do it, that would
be helpful. Thank you.

"
IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022722.txt,"Here’s the narrative: the shadowy rich man, friend of the louche and
disgraced President, at all times surrounded by a retinue of gorgeous
retainers doing his bidding, is now found to have gathered a network of
wrong-side-of-the-tracks Palm Beach girls to provide him with weird sexual
services. (It somehow reads weirder that he doesn’t have sex with them.) To
boot, his former girl friend, Ghislaine Maxwell the daughter of the
disgraced Robert Maxwell—encouraged at least one of the girls to come to
Epstein’s home (and forever more has become a fixture of further weird
possibilities in this tale).

Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter is reported to say: “This is
bigger than Rush Limbaugh,” who, in a storm of publicity, has just been
arrested in Palm Beach for possession of controlled drugs.

On one side are some of the nation’s most powerful defense attorneys
(who, increasingly, seem more stumblebum than effective), on the other side,
a round-up of hapless girls, with sensational tales of perversion and infamy
(in the telling they are not so much sex workers, as Dickensian victims),
relatively speaking giving the Palm Beach authorities the choice between
utter capitulation to the powerful or standing on the side of the exploited and
powerless.

Still, with a critical eye, it also quite appears to be a straightforward
tale of prostitution (however more or less kinky). And even though some of
the girls are minors, age is not a distinguishing factor in a prostitution charge
in Florida, nor in most places (in New York, for instance, at this time
soliciting sex with anyone over the age of 14 is a class D misdemeanor
calling for a $100 fine).

In fact, Saige Gonzales told the police that she lied about being 18
because otherwise she knew she would not have been admitted to the house.

The local sex crimes prosecutor, Lana Belhalevic, interviews the girls
and determines that the offense is solely related to prostitution—that there
are no innocent victims.

Dershowitz rejects a series of lower-level plea deals and Palm Beach
District Attorney Barry Krischer takes the unusual step of empanelling a
grand jury, which returns with a recommendation of a single count of
soliciting a prostitute—a charge without jail time. (And Epstein can apply to
have his record expunged after a year.)

At which point, Reiter, the police chief, at odds with the District
Attorney’s office, recruits the involvement of the FBI. This is of course the
Bush-era FBI and Epstein presents quite the Clinton-connected scandal. Still,
solicitation, even of a minor, is not a federal crime. The FBI hits on the novel

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014548.txt,"It follows that if real GDP is understated, then
what appears to be a slow recovery is not as slow
as reported and what appears to be a period of low
productivity growth is not as low as reported.

We believe that the evidence favors the
mismeasurement argument. At a September 2016
Brookings Institution conference on productivity,
Martin Feldstein, Harvard professor and president
emeritus of the National Bureau of Economic
Research, also concluded that “the official statistics
substantially underestimate the real growth
of output” after studying the methods used to
measure price indices.°°

We point to three examples to illustrate the
mismeasurement argument. First, our colleagues in
Goldman Sachs’ Global Investment Research (GIR)
have pointed out that the official price indices for
information and communication technology show
an implausible gap between the price deflation in
computers and that in communications equipment,
software and other IT equipment (see Exhibit 14).
They question how “a given dollar outlay now
buys about 10 times as much computer in real
terms as 20 years ago, but it only buys about 10%
more software.”

Our colleagues’ conclusion that the
official price indices for the information and
communication technology sector are overstated
matches that of a 2015 study of microprocessor
pricing by David Byrne of the Federal Reserve
Board, Professor Stephen Oliner of UCLA, and
Sichel.** The trio created an index showing that
prices for microprocessor units used in desktop
personal computers declined by an average
annual rate of 43% between 2008 and 2013,
while the official Producer Price Index (PPI)
for these units declined by an average annual
rate of 8%—substantially mismeasuring the
real value created by this sector of information
technology equipment. They point out that
because microprocessor units represent about half
of US shipments of semiconductors, the rate of
innovation in this sector is inevitably mismeasured.

A second example of mismeasurement that we
can all readily appreciate involves the quality and
product improvements in smartphones. Hal Varian,
chief economist at Google and emeritus professor
at the University of California at Berkeley, has
estimated that globally, people took over 1.6
trillion photos in 2015 using their smartphones,
compared with 80 billion in 2000 using cameras
and film. The price of each photo taken has gone

Exhibit 14: US Technology Price Indices
The implausible gap with hardware suggests IT and
communication price indices are likely overstated.

from 50 cents to zero for smartphone users; 1.6
trillion photos that would have contributed $800
billion to GDP have no impact on GDP in the
current framework. GDP has declined since camera
and film sales have fallen without a commensurate
quality adjustment for smartphones. Of course,
fewer photos would have been taken had the
smartphone not been developed, but the point

still stands.

Similarly, Varian shows that with the onset of
the commercial application of GPS technology,
productivity growth in trucking was twice the
aggregate US productivity growth, yet when GPS
functionality was added to smartphones basically
at no additional charge, GDP declined because
sales of stand-alone GPS systems fell.*4

Finally, a third example, also provided by
Varian, shows that, because GDP does not fully
count the export of intangibles such as software
and design, GDP is understated. He shows how an
iPhone manufactured by Foxconn in China using
parts from 28 countries and exported to France
has no direct impact on US GDP. Varian concludes
that in a global supply chain, US design and
software that is replicated outside the US through
offshore manufacturing and exported to a third
country never impacts US GDP measures directly,
particularly if the profits are not repatriated and
redeployed in the US.*

Our colleagues in GIR continue to estimate that
such mismeasurements lower reported annual real

Nava and I voted, we attended an event for Labor supporters north of Tel Aviv,
before flying to Beersheva to spend the final hours in the Negev. I’d arranged for
Shlomo Ben-Ami to go to Kiryat Shmona in the north — emphasizing, as
throughout the campaign, our determination to broaden our support beyond
Labor’s heartland. The polls closed at 10 o’clock. I knew Bibi would be staring at
the same Channel One newscast as I was, each of us ready to put the best spin on
things, especially if there was no clear sign at this stage which one of us had won.
But the exit poll findings came as a shock: Barak, of One Israel, 58.5 percent;
Netanyahu, Likud, 41.5 percent. It was a landslide.

The full impact hit me only when I got to the fifth-floor suite in the Dan Hotel
in Tel Aviv, our election-night headquarters. My three brothers, and Nava and our
daughters, were waiting for me. Leah Rabin, too. Our eyes teared up as we
embraced. My parents were by now too frail to come. But I’d promised to phone
them, whatever happened. “We did it,” I told my father, who said mazaltov with a
depth of feeling which had become rare as his health began to fail. My mother had
always been a bit conflicted about my going into politics, despite her lifelong
belief that the isswes of politics mattered, especially after Yitzhak had been cut
down and killed for following the path on which I hoped to continue. Still, I could
hear the pride, and relief, in her voice when I said: “Remember, ima. I did promise
you that if I ran, at least I'd make sure to win.”

When we’d finished speaking, Bibi called. He had conceded publicly as soon
as the exit poll was out. He had also stunned the Likud crowd by immediately
resigning as party leader. “Congratulations,” he said, sounding, more than
anything, tired. “I accept that the voters have spoken.” I thanked him for taking the
trouble to call. I said I appreciated the contribution he’d made to the country, and
that we’d meet in the next few days to discuss how best to handle the political
transition. “Thanks,” Bibi said. “And again, mazaltov.”

By the time I got off the phone with Bibi, the TV was showing pictures of tens
of thousands of people celebrating the results in the central Tel Aviv square, now
renamed in Rabin’s memory, where he had been murdered nearly four years
earlier. Before leaving to join them, I fielded a stream of calls: from friends, other
Israeli party leaders and leaders from abroad, including Tony Blair and Bill
Clinton, both of whom not only offered warm congratulations but said they looked
forward to working with me as I tried to move Israel forward and to finish the
work Yitzhak had begun.

As Steve Bannon continues his tour of Europe, energizing the anti-
establishment populist base, the mainstream media cannot help but 
admit their admiration for his abilities, despite their dislike of his aims. 
In this week's issue, the left-wing German weekly Stern articulates the greatest fear of the European 
establishment: that Bannon could give the fragmented right in Europe a common ideology and rhetoric. 
Many thought that the reign of the Dark Lord had ended, writes Gernot Kramper, when Steve Bannon left 
first the White House and then his role as executive chairman of Breitbart News. It turns out, however, that 
Bannon's adversaries had underestimated him, because he is as dangerous as ever, he confesses. 
Kramper cannot conceal his respect for Bannon's ability to move a crowd. He was greeted by frenetic 
applause in his recent address before France's National Front party, Kramper writes, demonstrating his 
impressive potential, which the writer describes as dangerous. 
In the mind of his audience, Bannon is something of a miracle-worker, Stamper notes, having done the 
impossible by bringing Donald Trump into the White House. 
The reason Bannon is dangerous, Kramper continues, is because he lays out the political program of a 
worldwide right: He has already conquered the USA; now Europe and then the whole world will follow. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025534 
You are part of a worldwide movement that is bigger than France, bigger than Italy, bigger than Hungary, 
bigger than all that, Bannon told French populists. 
Bannon showed that he dominates the mood against the 'elites,' the 'establishment' and the 'perverse 
system' of greedy corporations and banks, and of course also against the press, which is led around 'like a dog 
on the Leash, Stamper writes. 
And now he Mr. Bannon setting himself up as an instigator, if not an outright shepherd, of a movement that 
crosses borders, languages and parties. 
Bannon is a master of apocalyptic rhetoric, Stamper continues, effortlessly weaving together nationalist 
interests with an international populist movement. 
The American strategist showed his true caliber by expounding modern methods of political freedom 
through blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies, Stamper said, leaving many of his hearers behind. 
Bannon has demonstrated that if the right wants to rule the future, it must dominate modern themes and 
rhetorically position them, he added. 
Aspiring to be far more than an uncle who tells stories to his nephews of how he won the fight for the White 
House, Stamper writes, Bannon wants to become the super godfather of the international right. 
Although Bannon often looks a bit disheveled, he should not be underestimated, the writer warns. Past 
business partners attribute impressive strategic foresight to the eccentric tactician, saying he was often 
three or four steps ahead of his opponents in business. Because of his phenomenal memory, his nickname is 
the encyclopedia, Stamper notes with a certain reverence, and in his speeches he will spontaneously cite 
forgotten thinkers, known only to a handful of specialists. 
Bannon brings with him exclusive knowledge of power from the very heart of power, Stamper writes, 
which he will bring to bear on Europe's fragmented populist populism. 
According to Stamper, Bannon has established his European headquarters in Italy, from where he intends to 
galvanize European populists. 
The Italian political situation is completely to his liking, Stamper declares, with a political landscape 
dominated by populists, right-wing ideologues and the political puppeteer Berlusconi.

I set to work on the capital punishment project but found no suggestion in the case law that any
court had ever considered the death penalty to be of questionable constitutionality. Just five years
earlier, Chief Justice Earl Warren had written in Trop v. Dulles (1958) that “whatever the
arguments may be against capital punishment, both on moral grounds and in terms of
accomplishing the purposes of punishment—and they are forceful—the death penalty has been
employed throughout our history, and, in a day when it is still widely accepted it cannot be said to
violate the constitutional concept of cruelty.”

I duly reported this to Justice Goldberg, suggesting that if even the liberal chief justice believed
that the death penalty was constitutional, what chance did he have of getting a serious hearing for
his view that the cruel and unusual punishment clause should now be construed to prohibit the
imposition of capital punishment? Justice Goldberg asked me to talk to Justice Brennan and see
what his views were. Unless Justice Brennan agreed to join, the entire project would be scuttled,
since Justice Goldberg, the Court’s rookie, did not want to “be out there alone,” against the chief
justice and the rest of the Court.

I had previously met Justice Brennan several times over the preceding few years, since his son,
Bill, was my classmate and moot-court partner at Yale Law School. I had also had lunch several
times with the justice and his friend Judge David Bazelon. But none of our discussions had been
substantive, and I nervously anticipated the task of discussing an important issue with one of my
judicial heroes.

I brought a rough draft of the memorandum I was working on to the meeting, but Justice Brennan
did not want to look at it then. He asked me to describe the results of my research to him,
promising to read the memorandum later. I stated the nascent constitutional case against the
death penalty as best I could. I told him that Weems v. United States could be read as recognizing
the following tests for whether punishment was “cruel and unusual”: (I) giving full weight to
reasonable legislative findings, a punishment is cruel and unusual if a less severe one can as
effectively achieve the permissible ends of punishment (that is, deterrence, isolation, rehabilitation,
or whatever the contemporary society considers the permissible objectives of punishment);

(2) regardless of its effectiveness in achieving the permissible ends of punishment, a punishment is
cruel and unusual if it offends the contemporary sense of decency (for example, torture); (3)
regardless of its effectiveness in achieving the permissible ends of punishment, a punishment is
cruel and unusual if the evil it produces is disproportionally

higher than the harm it seeks to prevent (for example, the death penalty for economic crimes).

In addition to these abstract formulations, I also told Justice Brennan that my research had
disclosed a widespread pattern of unequal application of the death penalty on racial grounds. I
cited national prison statistics showing that between 1937 and 1951, 233 Blacks were executed
for rape in the United States, while only 26 whites were executed for that crime, though Whites
committed many more rapes than Blacks.

Justice Brennan encouraged me to continue my research, without making any promise that he
would join any action by Justice Goldberg. Several weeks later, Justice Goldberg told me that

Assuming there is a veto, what would you gain by upgrading your
status in the General Assembly?

The advantage is that you can be a full member of UNESCO, the
International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court,
and you may be able to hold Israel accountable.

So that's the plan if you fail in the Security Council?

We haven't decided yet beyond that. We would have to come back
and put the question to the leadership. There were nine ideas
presented about what to do if America vetoes. Was going to the
General Assembly discussed? Yes. Was throwing in the towel
discussed? Yes. Maybe we'll make a decision about that in the next
two weeks.

Throwing in the towel? You mean disbanding the Palestinian
Authority?

The Authority was born to transfer Palestinians from occupation to
independence. If Mr. [Benjamin] Netanyahu [the Israeli prime
minister] thinks he can make this Authority in name only while he is
the sole master and source of authority, he will sweat. If we get a
[U.S.] veto and Netanyahu continues to build the settlements, I would
suggest that Netanyahu study carefully the provisions of the Hague
Convention of 1907 and the Geneva Convention of 1949 which
specify the responsibilities of the occupying power.

If you fail in the Security Council and don't at least upgrade in

the General Assembly, won't you risk looking like a failure in the
eyes of Palestinians, particularly after all this buildup? Have you

conference, backed by the US and the
Quartet — in order to achieve a two-
state solution and establish a regional
agreement, while maintaining an
unyielding and persistent fight against
terrorism and ensuring the IDF's
qualitative military edge over any
combination of opponents.

¢ The moderates among Arab
rulers are unable (and also unwilling)
to float this common interest and turn
it into policy — because they worry
how their people would respond. This
is how the Palestinian issue 1s related
to possibility of an overall agreement

This is what I'm now going with—what do you think? 
In the White House, the President, to general surprise, announced that he would not accompany his family to 
Mar-a-Lago over the holidays—a confounding, even alarming, turn for anyone who knew how much he valued 
a golf-and-warm-weather opportunity over any presidential business. Melania certainly had no intention of 
staying behind. Among other issues, friends suggested that she was still furious about his fireside Christmas Eve 
chat with a seven-year-old boy, during which Trump asked the boy if he still believed in Santa. Melania didn't 
think that was funny, said one aide. Trump was clearly a guy who had never dealt with a seven-year-old. 
In an empty White House, Trump's personal secretary, 28-year-old Madeleine Westerhout, brought his 
papers and call sheets from the West Wing up to the residence, finding him, she told friends, in his underwear. 
And herein, suddenly, was another subplot. 
Westerhout had been the elevator girl in Trump Tower during the transition. The comely young woman ferrying 
dignitaries and job-seekers up to the President-elect soon became something of a meme herself Bannon recalled 
noting that Trump took a particular interest in her. A leering Trump kept repeating, She's got a way about her, 
his signature, and creepy, stamp of approval for young women. 
Now the president was telling friends that he wasn't staying at the White House because of the shutdown—he 
was staying because he was banging Madeleine. 
Shutdown bravado? Locker room talk? Or all part of a new alternative reality that only he seemed to be living 
in?

communications intelligence. It provided a valuable window on the
activities of adversary nations in the Pacific region and was able to
monitor the ballistic missile tests and submarine activities of China,
North Korea, and Russia. By 2013, the Kunia base had a vast array
of state-of-the-art technology, including ninety Cray supercom-
puters arranged in a horseshoe configuration, used to decipher and
make sense of the intercepted signals from China, Russia, and North
Korea. At the heart of the Hawaiian complex was a unit with both
military and civilian employees. A large share of the civilians who
ran the computers worked under two-year contracts with the NSA’s
leading civilian contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton.

General Alexander, who, as I said, headed the NSA in 2013, first
learned about an impending story in The Guardian on June 4, while
he was in Germany meeting with its top intelligence officials, from
Janine Gibson, The Guardian’s American website editor. She had
notified the NSA it intended to break a story focusing on the organi-
zation. It took NSA counterintelligence less than forty-eight hours
to determine that a civilian employee at the base from which docu-

© ments were stolen had not reported back to work on May 22. His ©
civilian supervisor had delayed reporting the absence to the NSA
until May 28. It also determined that the missing civilian employee,
Snowden, had lied on his application for a medical leave and had
flown to Hong Kong. Personal records showed he was being trained
as an analyst at the Threat Operations Center and had worked there
for less than six weeks. He had taken the medical leave on May 18
and left the country by plane. By June 6, he had become the NSA’s
main suspect.

Alexander flew to Washington, D.C., after assigning the sensi-
tive job of investigating the breach to a team headed by Richard
“Rick” Ledgett, who was then director of the NSA’s Threat Opera-
tions Center at the NSA’s headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland.
Ledgett was the logical choice to head the damage assessment inves-
tigation because the center’s regional branch in Hawaii was under
his command. Ledgett flew to Hawaii, where his first task was to
reconstruct the chronology of Snowden’s moves, or, as the tactic is
called in counterintelligence parlance, “walking the cat back.”

The NSA had also notified the FBI of Snowden’s possible involve-

Outlook | Investment Strategy Group 27

Low Expectations of a US Recession

Recessions in the US have been triggered by
Federal Reserve tightening of monetary policy; by
economic imbalances such as the bursting of the
dot-com and housing bubbles in 2000 and 2008,
respectively; or by external shocks such as the Arab
oil embargo in 1973. The first two triggers are
unlikely to occur in 2017, and the third, a shock,
is not something that we can typically anticipate.
However, we do think that China will be a

source of downside risk sometime over the next
three years.

First, as we mentioned in last year’s Outlook,
there have been five tightening cycles in the post-
WWII period that have not triggered a recession.
Four of those cycles occurred during the three
longest recoveries, as shown in Exhibit 24. Those
cycles have been characterized by an early start
to the tightening cycle, a slow pace relative to
historical averages (220 basis points per year for
nonrecessionary tightening and 330 basis points per
year in recessionary cycles), low core inflation and
slack in the labor market. This cycle shares those
characteristics: the tightening cycle started in 2015,
the pace has been 25 basis points per year, the core
personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index—
the Federal Reserve’s preferred benchmark for
inflation—is at 1.6% year over year as of November
2016, and our colleagues in GIR estimate that the
labor market still has about 0.3% slack.

Second, the US economy does not
suffer from any imbalances in which one
sector of the economy has become the
sole driver of growth or equity market
returns. Before the global financial crisis,
residential investment as a percentage
of GDP had peaked at 6.7% in 2005,
compared to a long-term average of
4.7%, and the credit-to-GDP gap as a
measure of nonfinancial sector leverage
had peaked at 12.4% in 2007 compared
to a long-term average of -1%, leading
to meaningful imbalances. Similarly, in
2000, technology and telecommunication
sector valuations were more than three
standard deviations higher than the
average of other sectors. Such imbalances
do not exist in the US at this time.

Third, while we cannot anticipate an
external shock—otherwise it would not
be a shock—we do not see imbalances in
other large economies except in China.

East. The Iranians evidently hoped that militancy against the west,
above all on behalf of the Palestinians, could counteract the league-of-
outsiders aspect of their alliance. For a while, this project appeared
to be working. The Iran-created and sponsored Hezbollah movement
managed to precipitate Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon in
2000, and then avoided defeat in a subsequent round of fighting in
2006. In a poll of Arab public opinion taken in 2008, the three most
popular leaders were Hassan Nasrallah, Bashar al-Assad and
Mahmoud Ahmedinejad, in that order. But this sense of inexorable
ascendancy in which the Iran-led bloc liked to cloak itself has fallen
victim to the Arab spring. First, the Saudis crushed a largely Shia
uprising in Bahrain which the Iranians backed. But more importantly,
Iran's tooth and nail defence of the brutal Assad regime in Syria is
progressively destroying its already shallow support Sunni Muslims.
Thus, a recent poll by the Arab-American Institute asked more than
4,000 Arabs their view of Iran. In Saudi Arabia, 6% had a positive
view — down from 89% in 2006. In Jordan, the positive rating fell
from 75% to 23%, in Egypt from 89% to 37% in the same period. The
uprising in Syria placed Iran in an impossible position. Maintaining
its ally in Damascus formed an essential strategic interest. Iran hoped,
following the US departure from Iraq, to achieve a contiguous line of
pro-Iranian, Shia states stretching from Iran itself to the
Mediterranean. But keeping this ambition alive in recent months
required offering very visible support to a non-Sunni regime engaged
in the energetic slaughter of its own, largely Sunni people. This has
led to the drastic decline in the standing of the Iranians and their
friends. Such a decline was probably inevitable. Outside the core
areas of Shia Arab population, Iran's support was broad but shallow.
It is noteworthy that since the Arab Spring, Hamas appears to have
distanced itself both from Assad and from the Iranians. According to

Plaintiffs assert claims under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2331 ef seg., and under the Racketeer-Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations (“RICO”) statute, *5 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962 ef seg., which conferred jurisdiction on the district court
through the specific grants of jurisdiction applicable to each statute and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. In some of the
underlying cases, plaintiffs and defendants were diverse, in that defendants were citizens of foreign states or of states
different from the states in which plaintiffs were citizens. Plaintiffs who are not U.S. persons assert claims for violations of
international law, over which the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to the Alien Tort Statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1350. The
district court further had supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ common law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367. Where
defendants claimed immunity under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and plaintiffs asserted the application of one or
more exceptions to immunity, the court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1330 & 1605. In addition, actions originally
filed in other jurisdictions were transferred to the Southern District of New York by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1407.

This Court has appellate jurisdiction of this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. The district court dismissed defendants in
this case in six orders dated January 18, 2005 Un re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001, 349 F. Supp. 2d 765
(“Terrorist Attacks”) (S.D.N.Y 2005)); September *6 21, 2005 (in re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001, 392 F. Supp.
2d 539 (“Terrorist Attacks IP’) (S.D.N.Y 2005)); November 20, 2006 Un re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001, 462 F.
Supp. 2d 561 (“SAMBA TP’) (S.D.N.Y. 2006)); December 14, 2006 Un re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001, 464 F.
Supp. 2d 335 (““DMI-Kamel?’) (S.D.N.Y. 2006)); June 17, 2010 Wn re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001, 718 F. Supp.
2d 456 (“Terrorist Attacks IV’) (S.D.N.Y. 2010)); and September 13, 2010 (In re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001,
740 F. Supp. 2d 494 (“Terrorist Attacks V’) (S.D.N.Y. 2010)).? Additional defendants remain in the case, which is still
pending below. On July 14, 2011, the district court entered a partial final judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure in favor of 75 defendants dismissed in those four orders, including each of the appellees. Plaintiffs
timely filed their notices of appeal on August 9, 2011, August 10, 2011, and August 11, 2011.

Statement of Issues Presented for Review

1. Whether plaintiffs’ allegations, accepted as true and with all reasonable inferences drawn from them in plaintiffs’ favor,
constitute a *7 prima facie showing that each of five defendants, for purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 2333, knew that or recklessly
disregarded whether al-Qaeda was the recipient of the financial and other support each defendant was providing to al-Qaeda.

2. Whether, for purposes of claims asserting violations of “the law of nations” under the Alien Tort Statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1350,
such violations include acts of international terrorism or are limited to the hijacking of commercial airplanes.

3. Whether claims arising under the Torture Victim Protection Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1350 note, can be asserted against defendants
who are not natural persons, including corporations and other legal entities.

4. Whether plaintiffs’ allegations, accepted as true and with all reasonable inferences drawn from them in plaintiffs’ favor,
constitute a prima facie showing that defendants who provided material support to al-Qaeda owed a duty of care, in relation

to negligence claims, to victims of an al-Qaeda attack in the United States.

5. Whether plaintiffs’ intentional tort claims related to the September 11, 2001 attacks in Virginia and Pennsylvania are
subject to New York’s one-year statute of limitations.

*8 6. Whether plaintiffs’ intentional tort claims related to the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York, Virginia, and
Pennsylvania are subject to equitable tolling even if subject to New York’s one-year statute of limitations.

7. Whether the dismissals of three defendants, based on a decision of this Court construing 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(5), should be
vacated because this Court has overruled that earlier decision since the filing of notices of appeals.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016377.txt,"You can show this in children’s everyday learning, too. Young children rapidly
learn abstract intuitive theories of biology, physics, and psychology in much the way
adult scientists do, even with relatively little data.

The remarkable machine-learning accomplishments of the recent AI systems, both
bottom-up and top-down, take place in a narrow and well-defined space of hypotheses
and concepts—a precise set of game pieces and moves, a predetermined set of images. In
contrast, children and scientists alike sometimes change their concepts in radical ways,
performing paradigm shifts rather than simply tweaking the concepts they already have.

Four-year-olds can immediately recognize cats and understand words, but they
can also make creative and surprising new inferences that go far beyond their experience.
My own grandson recently explained, for example, that if an adult wants to become a
child again, he should try not eating any healthy vegetables, since healthy vegetables
make a child grow into an adult. This kind of hypothesis, a plausible one that no grown-
up would ever entertain, is characteristic of young children. In fact, my colleagues and I
have shown systematically that preschoolers are better at coming up with unlikely
hypotheses than older children and adults.*? We have almost no idea how this kind of
creative learning and innovation is possible.

Looking at what children do, though, may give programmers useful hints about
directions for computer learning. Two features of children’s learning are especially
striking. Children are active learners; they don’t just passively soak up data like Als do.
Just as scientists experiment, children are intrinsically motivated to extract information
from the world around them through their endless play and exploration. Recent studies
show that this exploration is more systematic than it looks and is well-adapted to find
persuasive evidence to support hypothesis formation and theory choice.*° Building
curiosity into machines and allowing them to actively interact with the world might be a
route to more realistic and wide-ranging learning.

Second, children, unlike existing Als, are social and cultural learners. Humans
don’t learn in isolation but avail themselves of the accumulated wisdom of past
generations. Recent studies show that even preschoolers learn through imitation and by
listening to the testimony of others. But they don’t simply passively obey their teachers.
Instead they take in information from others in a remarkably subtle and sensitive way,
making complex inferences about where the information comes from and how
trustworthy it is and systematically integrating their own experiences with what they are
hearing.!

“Artificial intelligence” and “machine learning” sound scary. And in some ways
they are. These systems are being used to control weapons, for example, and we really
should be scared about that. Still, natural stupidity can wreak far more havoc than
artificial intelligence; we humans will need to be much smarter than we have been in the
past to properly regulate the new technologies. But there is not much basis for either the
apocalyptic or the utopian visions of AIs replacing humans. Until we solve the basic

Orgasms Aren't My Favorite Part Of Sex, and My Chastity Urge

My previous piece A Unified Theory of Orgasm was really well-received, and a lot of
people have thanked me for writing it. As always, though, there's some mixed feedback
too. And I've been worried about one thing in particular: it seems like a lot of people
missed the part in my article where I said that, now that I've learned how to have
orgasms... orgasms aren't even my favorite part of sex. It's a long article, and I can see
how people would miss that, but I did say it and I think it's important.

It may be ironic that I spent so much time feeling terrible and broken and depressed
because I couldn't figure out how to have orgasms... whereas now I prefer not to focus on
them. In fact, I estimate that most of my current sexual encounters don't include my
orgasm, and very few of my most pleasurable sexual encounters have included my
orgasm.

I'm the first to admit that I don't know everything about sex, and there's a lot that I haven't
experienced. Anything might change. But seriously. The best sex I've had in my life has
been connective and emotional and, for me personally, has frequently involved intense
BDSM. My favorite sex so far? Has also mostly been orgasm-free.

Some people in some sex-related communities have asserted that for maximum amorous
power, it's actually best to limit one’s orgasms, because then the contained sexual energy
ends up channeling into a deeper connection with one's partner. I can see that. For me,
another way of thinking about it is that I'm really into being teased -- and I'd rather
experience hours of being teased without an orgasm, than have a quick encounter that
ends in orgasm.

And.... (Oh no, I can already tell this is going to get complicated... but hey, sex is
complicated, so I'll give it a shot.).... Especially when I'm doing BDSM, it can actually be
hot sometimes if I don't have an orgasm. For example: if I go to sleep so turned on that I
can't dream about anything but my partner, and then I wake up in a damp mess, and then
my partner makes my life difficult all morning, it's pretty awesome. (Although it's very
nice that I know how to give myself orgasms now, because that means that if I'm really
feeling overwhelmed by my own sexual energy, I know how to give myself release if I
have to. You know, like... if I need to get some work done.)

Aaaaand... here's the most painful, ridiculous, circular irony of all. Ready? Here goes:
now that I'm capable of having orgasms, I've found myself occasionally having orgasms
only to satisfy my partner. How absurd is that? Plus, I know I'm not alone, because I've
talked to other women who do the same thing!

I've written before that in the past I've felt trapped by fake plastic ideas of what hot girls
look like during sex; I've written about how the pressure to perform my sexuality can
hurt. What has amazed me, as I've gotten older, is just how pervasive that pressure can
feel with some partners... and how little pressure there is with other partners. The
question of how to create a low-pressure environment for sexuality to flourish is big and
complicated, so let me just say here that although I'm all about people giving each other
orgasms... it's no good if my partner's desire to give me an orgasm turns into pressure for

setting for the spiritual work toward that promised in John “...that you love one
another; even as | have loved you, that you also love one another.”

In contrast with what has been described in previous chapters as the
entheogenic drug-induced transitions to a spiritual mind, one is tempted to describe
these Fundamentalists’ states as the amphetamine religions. The Los Angeles
Ram’s Hall of Fame defensive end, on very high doses of amphetamine (125
milligrams compared with the diet dose of 5 milligrams) taken four hours before the
Sunday games, the Baptist minister, Deacon Jones, used his famous and
consciousness annihilating head slap to daze the opposing offensive tackle in order
to gain access to and injure the other team’s quarterback. Before taking the handful
of Dexedrine spansuls, he would tell me, “See you on Tuesday.” Along with the
Deacon’s destructive aggression was the other invariant feature of the actions of
high doses of amphetamine, compulsive stereotypy, the fixity and driven repetition
of over simplified actions and thoughts along with the loss of breadth of vision and
adaptive flexibility. Deacon consistently rushed inside, took the inside lane, in spite
of offensive linemen, who having studied previous game films, being set up to
expect his route. They used this knowledge to take him out of the play. In modern
theological parlance, judgmental rigidity and thinly veiled disapproval take the place
of the more flexibly curious and lovingly humane feelings of the participants in the
evolution in spiritual understanding of today’s /iberal Protestant process religions.
These are the ones that believe that the properties of God evolve along with our
biology, our brains and our growing scientific understanding of ourselves and the
world.

Angry splitting is not just a stimulant drug effect. Recall my experience of the
sudden emergence of a first second wind after a mile or so of my daily ten miles of
running. It was frequently accompanied by inner bursts of obsessive, paranoid
thoughts. Taking five milligrams of amphetamine felt much like the first second
wind. | am full of energy with arrogant feelings of power, mind fixated in grand and
simple ideas that | believe to be absolute and correct. | feel irritably intolerant about

anyone or anything different. It is my virtuous duty to set everyone straight.

Q. Okay.
A. I--+I think the record should be clear,
I'm -- I'm an attorney and a law professor in Salt Lake
City, Utah, and my understanding, he's an attorney here
in Florida. So I don't ordinarily interact with --
with, you know, attorneys in Florida, other than the
ones that I'm interacting with on -- on this case.

very regular basis.

MR. SCOTT: No teaming, Mr. Scarola, please.
BY MR. SIMPSON:
Q._ -- did -- didn't you testify yesterday that
the fact that Mr. Josefsberg's firm had filed a

complaint against Miss Roberts, who is also your client,

to be significant to your evaluation of the case?

A. Yes.

QQ. And if it -- if that was significant to
evaluation of the case, why are you telling us you don't
normally talk with attorneys in Florida? Doesn't he
represent -- at one point, represent the same client?

A. Right.

Q. And so wouldn't it be natural for you to be
speaking with -- at Jleast within the realm of something
one might expect for you to speak?

A. If I were a solo representative of Virginia
Roberts, that would be the case, but I think you're
obviously aware that I have co-counsel on this case, and
there are other attorneys who are also participating in
this matter.

So I think it would be obvious that if
there's a division of labor, it might not be along the
lines that you're suggesting. And I can't go any
further without going into work product and other issues
surrounding Miss Roberts’ representation.

Q. Has Mr. Boies ever told you that he believes
Miss Roberts was mistaken in her accusations against
Professor Dershowitz?

MR. SCAROLA: Same objection. Same
instruction.

MS. McCAWLEY: Same instruction.

THE WITNESS: I'd like to confer with my
counsel on a attorney/client privilege issue in
connection with that question.

MS. McCAWLEY: Can I just write down the
question and --

Q. Have you ever -- I'll rephrase the question.

Have you ever discussed with Mr. Boies his
views as to whether or not Miss Roberts is mistaken in
her allegations against Professor Dershowitz?

MS. McCAWLEY: Objection.

MR. SCAROLA: Same objection. Same

instruction.
BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. Prior to December 30th of 2014, had you
personally reviewed any of the flight logs that had been
referred to in the testimony in this case?

A. All right?

Q. My only question is whether you personally
reviewed them.

A. Yes.

Q. What flight logs have you reviewed; how would
you describe them?

A. Both Exhibit 1 and Exhibit 2 that were shown
to Mr. Dershowitz yesterday.

Q. If -- I believe those were Exhibits 6 and
7--

A. Okay.

Q. — -- but can we agree that flight logs were
marked as exhibits?

ESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS
(954) 331-4400
187

A. Right. The two composite exhibits of flight
logs I had examined previously.

Q. Okay. So the same documents that Professor
Dershowitz was shown at his deposition; is that right?

A. That's my recollection, yes.

Q. Okay. When did you review those?

A. So one of the reviews was in May 2014. There
may have also been an earlier review at an earlier ~~
earlier time, but I definitely remember reviewing them
in May -- approximately May 2014.

Q. Would -- do you -- isn't it true that those
flight logs support Professor Dershowitz's testimony
that he was never on a plane with Virginia Roberts?

A. No.

Q. How do they not? What is -- what is the
explanation for your conclusion in that regard?

A. Right. We talked about this yesterday, so
I'll incorporate to speed things up some of the
testimony that I gave yesterday.

What the flight logs showed was, to my mind,
evidence of potential doctoring, evidence of -- of
selective presentation of evidence. Mr. Dershowitz had
presented to a law enforcement agency, at their request,
apparently what I understood to be the -- the -- I
understood that he had been requested by a law

star.

One criterion to apply to a potentially purposeful phenomenon is whether it’s
minimal in achieving a purpose. But does that mean that it was built for the purpose?
The ball rolls down the hill because of gravitational pull. Or the ball rolls down the hill
because it’s satisfying the principle of least action. There are typically these two
explanations for some action that seems purposeful: the mechanistic explanation and the
teleological. Essentially all of our existing technology fails the test of being minimal in
achieving its purpose. Most of what we build is steeped in technological history, and it’s
incredibly non-minimal for achieving its purpose. Look at a CPU chip; there’s no way
that that’s the minimal way to achieve what a CPU chip achieves.

This question of how to identify purposefulness is a hard one. It’s an important
question, because radio noise from the galaxy is very similar to CDMA transmissions
from cell phones. Those transmissions use pseudo-noise sequences, which happen to
have certain repeatability properties. But they come across as noise, and they’re set up as
noise, so as not to interfere with other channels. The issue gets messier. If we were to
observe a sequence of primes being generated from a pulsar, we’d ask what generated
them. Would it mean that a whole civilization grew up and discovered primes and
invented computers and radio transmitters and did this? Or is there just some physical
process making primes? There’s a little cellular automaton that makes primes. You can
see how it works if you take it apart. It has a little thing bouncing inside it, and out
comes a sequence of primes. It didn’t need the whole history of civilization and biology
and so on to get to that point.

I don’t think there is abstract “purpose,” per se. I don’t think there’s abstract
meaning. Does the universe have a purpose? Then you’re doing theology in some way.
There is no meaningful sense in which there is an abstract notion of purpose. Purpose is
something that comes from history.

One of the things that might be true about our world is that maybe we go through
all this history and biology and civilization, and at the end of the day the answer is “42,”
or something. We went through all those 4 billion years of various kinds of evolution
and then we got to “42.”

Nothing like that will happen, because of computational irreducibility. There are
computational processes that you can go through in which there is no way to shortcut that
process. Much of science has been about shortcutting computation done by nature. For
example, if we’re doing celestial mechanics and want to predict where the planets will be
a million years from now, we could follow the equations, step-by-step. But the big
achievement in science is that we’re able to shortcut that and reduce the computation.
We can be smarter than the universe and predict the endpoint without going through all
the steps. But even with a smart enough machine and smart enough mathematics, we
can’t get to the endpoint without going through the steps. Some details are irreducible.
We have to irreducibly follow those steps. That’s why history means something. If we
could get to the endpoint without going through the steps, history would be, in some
sense, pointless.

So it’s not the case that we’re intelligent and everything else in the world is not.
There’s no enormous abstract difference between us and the clouds or us and the
cellular automata. We cannot say that this brainlike neural network is qualitatively

prominent Chinese commentators are no longer on VOA’s lineup of analysts. Many
staffers now describe VOA’s content as neither pro- nor anti-China. The emphasis, the

Conclusion and Recommendations

China has used America’s openness to convey its message both to English- and
Chinese-speaking residents of the United States. US rules allow foreign media
companies, even ones run by foreign governments, to broadcast freely via American
cable and satellite networks. Unlike in China, the United States government does

not block any Chinese websites, many of which are funded by the PRC government.
While the Communications Act of 1934 theoretically only allows foreigners to own

20 to 25 percent of terrestrial wireless radio and TV stations, the law has been loosened
considerably over the past decade, and it does not even apply to cable channels or leasing
arrangements wherein a foreign entity, including one owned by a foreign government,
can pay an American licensee for airtime. Chinese media outlets have used all such
strategies to publicize the views of the Beijing government.** Perhaps more worrisome,
China has also been successful in funding or convincing pro-PRC businessmen to fund
pro-PRC media outlets in the United States that nominally appear independent so that
the three most important traditionally independent Chinese-language newspapers now

increasingly side with Beijing.

By contrast, the Chinese government severely limits the scope of US and other Western
media outlets in China and has banned Western media investment in China, except in
very limited innocuous areas, such as in fashion, automobiles, investing, health, and
lifestyle. The idea that a Western TV news network could lease a Chinese station and
broadcast news to China around the clock—as their Chinese counterparts do here in
the United States—is not even thinkable. Equally, there is no chance that a Western

media company would be allowed to invest in a Chinese publication that reported

mainstream news.

Both the expansion of Chinese state-owned English-language media in the United
States and Beijing’s increasing control of Chinese-language media outlets in the United

States are very problematic for an open dialogue. For one, these media are under the

Furthermore, CHART 3 shows that, directionally, the Li Keqiang
Index maps pretty well to the ebb and flow of Chinese property
prices, confirming the thesis that property prices have much
impact on the Chinese economy.

A close examination of CHART 2 raises an interesting observation:
Lately, the Li Keqiang Index has accelerated much more than the
reported GDP growth. One could surmise that China’s actual
GDP growth (measured on a year-over-year basis rather than on
an annualized sequential change) may have been greater than
the reported 6.9% in the first quarter of 2017. This could be
rationalized by the conjecture that the actual growth in early
2016 may have been lower than the reported 6.7%.

One indicator of China’s strong growth is the year-over-year
changes in its imports as shown in CHART 4. Imports surged
24% year-over-year in U.S. dollar terms, and 31% in renminbi
terms during the first quarter of 2017. To be fair, part of the
surge was due to the rebound in commodity prices. However,
China’s $58 billion import from Germany and Japan, two non-
commodity countries, was still up an impressive 17% year-on-
year. In the first quarter of 2016, China’s imports from those two
countries had declined 10%.

We believe China’ strong reflation, thanks to the infrastructure
buildout and the unprecedented property price increases in
major cities, may have been the most impactful yet under-
appreciated catalyst that fueled the synchronized global
economic recovery since the summer of 2016. The good news
is that China’s growth is likely to remain healthy for the
remainder of 2017, as stability is paramount ahead of the
quinquennial power transition this autumn. However, the
uncertainty starts to rise as we look beyond 2017.

Shadow Boxing

Over the past few years, China watchers have been urging
Chinese policymakers to introduce bold reforms and market
forces to tackle the country’s rapidly growing leverage, over
capacity, and housing bubble. However, with stability being of
utmost importance, policymakers could not afford to take a
chance with the market's invisible hand. Tough reforms in the
context of slowing economic growth also ran the risk of
jeopardizing social stability. Now, however, with the economy
ona much stronger footing, Chinese policymakers have started
to push through some needed reforms.

provide a subconscious association in the minds of voters who were

What the American public does not realize is the impact of the long-

Jimmy Carter—with all his religiosity and his talk about not living in sin—is

dismissed the remaining ATA claims against Al Rajhi Bank brought on behalf of the other plaintiff groups. SPA63, 65-66.

A bank’s provision of banking services constitutes material support of terrorism if the services were provided “knowing or
intend[ing] that such provision would generally facilitate ... terrorist activities ...” Wultz, 755 F. Supp. 2d at 44-46; see also Linde,
384 F. Supp. 2d at 588 (“[G]iven plaintiffs’ allegations regarding the knowing and intentional nature of the Bank’s activities, there
is nothing ‘routine’ about the services the Bank is alleged to provide”); Weiss, 453 F. Supp. 2d at 625 (“Where the Bank knows
that the groups to which it provides services are engaged in terrorist activities even the provision of basic banking services may
qualify as material support” (quotation marks and citation omitted)).

Contrary to the district court’s findings, SPA112-14 (SAMBA I), SPA103-04 (SAMBA J), the proposed amendments to plaintiffs’
pleadings clearly did sufficiently allege, inter alia, that Saudi American Bank had the requisite mental state when it provided
material support to Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda. R.1926, pp. 3-6, n.10. Accordingly, if this court finds that the pleadings do not
state a claim for relief, this Court should remand this claim for the district court to revisit its denial of the motion for
reconsideration of its denial of the motion for leave to amend.

This report was published subsequent to the initial briefing below, and submitted in connection with plaintiffs’ opposition to
NCB’s renewed motion to dismiss. However, the facts reflected in the report were of record from the outset, as reflected in
plaintiffs” pleadings as to Al Rajhi Bank.

The annex lists nine treaties, including the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, done at the Hague on

From 1980, Beijing added to its stable of foreign-facing propaganda publications—such
as Beijing Review, China Reconstructs, and China Pictorial—by starting or reopening
more than twenty periodicals, including the English-language China Daily, the overseas
edition of the People’s Daily, the overseas edition of Outlook (#), and the Voice of China
(44748). The Party also resumed publishing material for overseas Chinese. During the
Cultural Revolution, the number of magazines targeting overseas Chinese had shrunk
to ten, whereas by the end of the 1980s, it had surpassed 130. Before 1982, the state-run
Xinhua News Agency had focused almost solely on providing news to domestic Chinese
clients. In 1983, however, it also began sending news to international clients. The China
News Service, which had suspended operations during the Cultural Revolution, also
resumed work, sending hundreds of stories a day to overseas Chinese-language media.
Today the CNS employs more than two thousand people worldwide, working out of
forty-six bureaus. The Party directed its media outlets in their overseas work to support
socialism with Chinese characteristics, push the policies of reform and opening up, and

oppose hegemonism, or, in other words, fight against Western ideological control.

In the run-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, China’s propaganda agencies redoubled
their efforts to “grab the right to speak,” or gain “discourse power” (ifiB 4X).

The worldwide torch-lighting ceremony touched off free-Tibet rallies and other
human rights protests that angered Chinese authorities and some Chinese as well.

An anti-CNN movement began in China, alleging that Western media outlets were
distorting “China’s story.” This was the genesis for what has come to be known as the
Grand Overseas Propaganda Campaign (AJB), first promoted by the administration
of Party Chief Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao. The International Herald Leader, a
publication of the Xinhua News Agency, reported in 2009 that foreign propaganda
work had been elevated by the Party to a “systematic, strategic position,” the goal of
which was to “grab back the right to speak, and improve China’s international image.”’
Reports that had first surfaced in Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post in 2009, that
China had earmarked $7 billion for the campaign, were soon repeated by the Chinese

media, most notably in the March 14 edition of Phoenix Weekly.®

The Grand Overseas Propaganda Campaign has been grand, indeed, with Chinese
sources reporting hundreds of millions of dollars being spent on a multitude of projects
designed to bolster China’s image. The expansion of the Xinhua News Agency is but
one example. From 120, the number of Xinhua bureaus around the world has now
grown to more than 200’ and its client base has expanded to more than 1,450, What is

more, it now reports in seven languages and competes directly with all the major wire

MARIELA M. VARGOVA, PH.D.

The Promise of Governance

Reform—South Korea

n his inauguration speech on May 10th, the newly elected

South Korean President Moon Jae-In vowed to put chaebol

reform at the forefront of his political and economic agenda.
“Under the Moon Jae-In administration,” he asserted, “the
collusive link between politics and business will completely
disappear.’ The promise of meaningful governance reform
comes in the wake of the biggest political corruption scandal in
Korea that saw the impeachment and the arrest of democratically
elected President Park Geun-Hye on charges of “collecting or
demanding $52 million in bribes”? from Samsung, one of
Korea’s largest family-owned conglomerates, known as chaebol.

The presidential scandal in Korea also led to the latest high-
profile corporate arrest in the country. In February, Jay Y. Lee,
vice chairman and acting leader of Samsung’s conglomerate
empire, was arrested on accusations of bribery to former
President Park and her inner circle in exchange for securing a
controversial merger of Samsung Construction and Trading
Corporation and Cheil Industries. While the image of a
handcuffed Lee sent shockwaves across the business world, his
arrest was not unprecedented. In the past, his father Lee Kun-
Hee, current chairman of Samsung, was convicted twice of
corruption and pardoned. Similarly, in 2007, Hyundai’s
Chairman Chung Mon-Koo was found guilty of fraud and
pardoned. And in 2013, SK’s Chairman Chey Tae-Won was
convicted of embezzlement and later pardoned.’ The family-
owned conglomerates have long dominated the economic life
of modern Korean society, accounting for roughly 50% of the
total share of the Korean stock market. Their close ties with the
government and state bureaucracy have fueled growing public
distrust and frustration with the nation’s leadership and has led
to increased shareholder discontent.

Korea’s Governance Practices

The collusion of politics and business in Korea highlights the
poor practices of corporate governance and business ethics.
Corporate governance studies on Asia consistently rate Korea as
lagging in governance behind leaders in the region.* Korea
underperforms its peers in the areas of board independence,
ethics and transparency in corporate governance.

Korea, however, has not always been viewed as the laggard in
Asia’s governance landscape. Right after the Asian Financial
Crisis of 1997-1998, the country underwent important
governance reforms that sought to quickly and significantly
increase corporate board independence and the overall
governance of publicly-traded Korean companies. For instance,
the proportion of listed firms with at least one outside director
grew from 34% in 1999, to 62.3% in 2000, to reach 94% in 2007.°
In 2001 and 2003, the country’s Security Exchange Acts required
large listed companies (those with about $2 billion in market
capitalization) on the Korea Exchange and KOSDAQ to have at
least three outside directors and for one half of their boards to
be independent. In 2004, the board independence requirements
were further strengthened with the stipulation that there be a
majority of independent board directors for large companies.
This is on par with leading international best practices in
corporate governance. The Korean Commercial Code also
stipulates that outside or independent directors must not be
related to management while acting as fiduciaries.® This
resonated with the impetus towards greater board independence
to mitigate the role of corporate insiders and create new
independent auditing structures within Korean corporations.

In 2012, the Korean Commercial Code was revised to further
enhance the board’s fiduciary duties. It required the approval of
two-thirds of directors for all internal transactions and for new
business dealings with third parties. If transactions or deals
benefit founding families or management at the expense of
minority shareholders, the approving directors will be personally
liable for the losses.’

Notwithstanding these developments towards good governance,
ethics controversies involving Korean chaebols surged over the
past several years. A prime example is the notorious Hyundai
Motor land bid in 2014 for which the company paid the excessive
price of $10 billion, three times the land’s market value of $3
billion, angering investors and hurting shareholder value.
According to reports, while the boards of directors of Hyundai
consortium companies voted to unanimously approve the deal,
the company’s outside directors were kept in the dark about the
price as it was considered by management to be a confidential
matter. All these instances point to a serious lapse in the

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023400.txt,"In re: TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001., 2012 WL 257568 (2012)

involve a violation of a norm of customary international law that is “(1) universal and obligatory, (2) specific and definable,
and (3) of mutual concern [to States.]” Abdullahi v. Pfizer, Inc., 562 F.3d 163, 177 (2d Cir. 2009), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct.
3541 (2010). As the district court recognized, SPA233 (Terrorist Attacks V), aircraft hijacking has long been recognized as a
violation of international law that meets these criteria and can give rise to tort claims under the ATS. See, e.g., Kadic v.
Karadzic, 70 R3d 232, 239 (2d Cir. 1996); cf United States v. Yunis, 924 F.2d 1086, 1092 (D.C. Cir. 1991). What the district
court failed to recognize, however, is that the broader concept of international terrorism is also a violation of customary
international law that is actionable under the ATS, and plaintiffs adequately alleged that defendants engaged in, and aided
and abetted, illegal acts of international terrorism.

*123 A. Plaintiffs Alleged That Defendants Violated the ATS By Intentionally Facilitating International Terrorism

The Burnett plaintiffs allege that “the Defendants, individually, jointly and severally, aided and abetted, sponsored, financed,
promoted, fostered, materially supported, or otherwise conspired to proximately cause the death and injury of innocent
persons namely the Plaintiffs herein through and by reason of acts of international terrorism -- the heinous attacks of
September 11, 2001.” JA970. “As a result and proximate cause of the Defendants’ sponsorship of terrorism in violation of the
law of nations and customary principles of international law, the Plaintiffs suffered injury and damages as set forth herein.”
JA972. Such allegations state a claim under the ATS because facilitation of international terrorism is a violation of customary
international law that is universal, obligatory, specific and of mutual concern to States.

B. Acts of International Terrorism are a Violation of Customary International Law

In considering whether alleged violations of customary international law are universal, obligatory, specific and of mutual
concern to States, courts consider whether the conduct is banned by international conventions and treaties ratified by an
overwhelming majority of States, *124 condemned by binding United Nations Security Council resolutions, and repudiated
by individual nations. See, e.g., Flores v. S. Peru Copper Corp., 414 F.3d 233, 256-57, 261-62 (2d Cir. 2003); Filartiga v.
Pena-lrala, 630 F.2d 876, 881-84 (2d Cir. 1980). Because the Constitution specifically gives Congress the power to “define
and punish ... Offenses against the Law of Nations,” U.S. Const., art. I, § 8, cl. 10, courts should also accord deference to
Congress’s determination of what conduct constitutes an offense under the law of nations. See, e.g., Ex parte Quirin, 317
USS. 1, 26 (1942).

Plaintiffs have stated valid ATS claims because international conventions, U.N. Security Council resolutions, the domestic
laws of many nations, and laws enacted by Congress pursuant to its authority to define and punish offenses against the laws
of nations all demonstrate that there is a universal and obligatory norm against the commission of and material support of
international terrorism alleged here -- namely, transnational acts intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to civilians
for the purpose of intimidating the population or compelling a government to do some act or refrain from acting.

*125 I. United Nations Security Council resolutions

The U.N. Security Council has adopted numerous resolutions condemning international terrorism and support for
international terrorism. In 1998, for example, the Security Counsel adopted a resolution “[s]trongly condemn[ing] the
terrorist bomb attacks” on the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on August 7, 1998 “which claimed hundreds of
innocent lives, injured thousands of people, and caused massive destruction to property.” S.C. Res. 1189, U.N. Doc.
S/RES/1189 (Aug. 13, 1998) at § 1. Later in 1998, the Security Council issued a resolution expressing concern about the
“continuing use of Afghan territory, especially areas controlled by the Taliban, for the sheltering and training of terrorists and
the planning of terrorist acts, and reiterating that the suppression of international terrorism is essential for the maintenance of
international peace and security.” S.C. Res. 1214, U.N. Doc. S/RES/1214 (Dec. 8, 1998) at preamble and 7 13 (emphasis in
original). In addition to the Security Council, the U.N. General Assembly has also adopted resolutions condemning
intentional terrorism, including the provision of support to terrorists. See, e.g., G.A. Res. 210, U.N. GAOR, 51st Sess., Annex
1 at 6, U.N. Dec. A/RES/51/210 (1997) (declar[ing] that knowingly *126 financing, planning and inciting terrorist attacks are
... contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations”).

Table 12.5: Integrative Model of the Stages of Ethical Development, Part 2

The main engine of advancement from the conventional to mature stage, we suggest, is robust
and subtle integration of the simulative and inferential components. To expand empathy beyond
the most obvious cases, analogical inference is needed; and to carry out complex inferences about
justice, empathy-guided inference-control is needed.

Finally, to advance from the mature to the enlightened stage, what is required is a very
advanced capability for unified reflexive inference and simulation. The system must be able
to understand itself deeply, via modeling itself both simulatively and inferentially — which
will generally be achieved via a combination of being good at modeling, and becoming less
convoluted and more coherent, hence making self-modeling easier.

Of course, none of this tells you in detail how to create an AGI system with advanced
ethical capabilities. What it does tell you, however, is one possible path that may be followed to
achieve this end goal. If one creates an integrative AGI system with appropriately interconnected
inferential and simulative components, and treats it compassionately and fairly, and provides
it extensive, experientially grounded ethical instruction in a rich social environment, then the
AGI system should be able to ascend the ethical hierarchy and achieve a high level of ethical
sophistication. In fact it should be able to do so more reliably than human beings because of
the capability we have to identify its errors via inspecting its internal knowedge-stage, which

Lastly, OFAC could simply delist Hamas or continue allowing aid to
the PA under a “general license.” But this would not do away with
the independent criminal ban on providing “material support” to an
FTO. To remove Hamas from the criminal law banning FTO support,
either the secretary of state or Congress would have to revoke the
designation of Hamas as an FTO -- a highly unlikely scenario.
Should the Obama administration want to continue funding a Hamas-
affiliated PA to maintain U.S. influence or otherwise promote U.S.
interests, current law gives him little leeway to do so. PATA places
numerous restrictions on any aid to a Hamas-affiliated PA, and any
attempt by the White House to continue funding the PA in spite of
PATA risks violating criminal statutes. Short of removing Hamas as a
designated terrorist organization and FTO, the safest way to proceed
would be on the basis of legislative action that allows White House to
support the PA even under a Fatah-Hamas coalition. Without it, the
Obama administration’s legal options are limited. No matter how
much it may want to continue aiding the PA, then, its continued
support may well be illegal.

technology to do. In the case of magnetic materials, there are plenty of ways to do that.
In terms of programs, it’s the same story. There are all kinds of programs out there, even
tiny programs that do complicated things. Could we entrain them for some useful human
purpose?

And how do you get Als to execute your goals? One answer is to just talk to
them, in the natural language of human utterances. It works pretty well when you’re
talking to Siri. But when you want to say something longer and more complicated, it
doesn’t work well. You need a computer language that can represent sophisticated
concepts in a way that can be progressively built up and isn’t possible in natural
language. What my company spent a lot of time doing was building a knowledge-based
language that incorporates the knowledge of the world directly into the language. The
traditional approach to creating a computer language is to make a language that
represents operations that computers intrinsically know how to do: allocating memory,
setting values of variables, iterating things, changing program counters, and so on.
Fundamentally, you’re telling computers to do things in your own terms. My approach
was to make a language that panders not to the computers but to the humans, to take
whatever a human thinks of and convert it into some form that the computer can
understand. Could we encapsulate the knowledge we’d accumulated, both in science and
in data collection, into a language we could use to communicate with computers? That’s
the big achievement of my last thirty years or so—being able to do that.

Back in the 1960s, people would say things like, “When we can do such-and-
such, we’ll know we have AI. When we can do an integral from a calculus course, we’ll
know we have AI. When we can have a conversation with a computer and make it seem
human... ,” et cetera. The difficulty was, “Well, gosh, the computer just doesn’t know
enough about the world.” You’d ask the computer what day of the week it was, and it
might be able to answer that. You'd ask it who the President was, and it probably
couldn’t tell you. At that point, you’d know you were talking to a computer and not a
person. But now when it comes to these Turing Tests, people who’ ve tried connecting,
for example, Wolfram|Alpha to their Turing Test bots find that the bots lose every time.
Because all you have to do 1s start asking the machine sophisticated questions and it will
answer them! No human can do that. By the time you’ve asked it a few disparate
questions, there will be no human who knows all those things, yet the system will know
them. In that sense, we’ve already achieved good AI, at that level.

Then there are certain kinds of tasks easy for humans but traditionally very hard
for machines. The standard one is visual object identification: What is this object?
Humans can recognize it and give some simple description of it, but a computer was just
hopeless at that. A couple of years ago, though, we brought out a little image-
identification system, and many other companies have done something similar—ours
happens to be somewhat better than the rest. You show it an image, and for about ten
thousand kinds of things, it will tell you what it is. It’s fun to show it an abstract painting
and see what it says. But it does a pretty good job.

It works using the same neural-network technology that McCulloch and Pitts
imagined in 1943 and lots of us worked on in the early eighties. Back in the 1980s,
people successfully did OCR—optical character recognition. They took the twenty-six
letters of the alphabet and said, “OK, is that an A? Is that a B? Is that a C?” and so on.

we went along, and then I would tell him exactly what it took.

Unfortunately, it wasn't that easy. Months and years passed without replicating the
incident. Anxiety began seeping back. My Unified Orgasm Theory was not doing well.

My fear of being perceived as demanding during sex and relationships was at a
ridiculous extreme back then. For example, I'd heard over and over that boys don't like
girls who are high-maintenance, so I told my boyfriends that I never wanted them to
buy me flowers. I thought that men would feel relieved that they didn't have to cater to
me, but they were just puzzled. (One responded by buying me fake flowers.)

Because of the awful shaming stereotypes around cunnilingus, I sometimes refused that
too. I couldn't believe that the boyfriends who were willing to go down on me were
actually enthusiastic about it, enjoying it -- and when my anxiety became too painful, I
inevitably stopped them. I always stopped them long before I stopped enjoying the act,
because I was so scared that they hated it, and hated me for wanting it. I was scared that
they resented me more and more, the longer they did it and I didn't come. My fear crept
up my spine and twisted around my heart until I had to make them stop.

Sometimes I felt trapped between love and disgust, like with the boyfriend who
constantly complimented me on how great in bed I was, but who seemed unaware of how
much I felt missing. The worst was when he went off on a rhapsodic list of my wonderful
qualities ending with: ... and I don't even have to worry about giving you an orgasm!
He didn't see the bind he was putting me in, the awful self-suppression and self-wounding
that he encouraged. He seemed unaware that I heard him telling me: You're great in bed
because you are constantly disappearing your own needs, and never asking anything
complicated of me!”

In fairness, I wasn't giving him any guidance on how to do better with me. In fairness, I
had no idea what kind of guidance to give.

They had their own social programming, and I didn't communicate well. But sometimes I
still have trouble forgiving my early boyfriends.

TK OK ok

IV. The Fight

Not all my boyfriends were willing to do as little as going down on me. One, in
particular, resisted very strongly; never did it at all. This was an especial problem because
he was one of the men I've loved most in my life, and our relationship lasted for years. I
think well of him when I think of anything other than sex. But when I remember having
sex with him, I feel echoes of sick panic and heartbreak.

By the end, every time I slept with him I felt nothing but disgust.

He seemed to prove all my fears: that the men in my life would loathe and resent me if I
tried to discuss my confusion and desperation; that they would loathe and resent me if I

asked for help with my sexual needs. Towards the beginning of our relationship, I tried

asking him (very timidly) to go down on me, and he simply refused. In later

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016363.txt,"“URGENT!” URGENT!” the cc’d copy of an email screamed, one of a dozen emails that
greeted me as I turned on my phone at the baggage carousel at Malpensa Airport after
the long flight from JFK. “The great American visionary thinker John Brockman arrives
this morning at Grand Hotel Milan. You MUST, repeat MUST pay him a visit.” It was
signed HUO.

The prior evening, waiting in the lounge at JFK, I had had the bright idea to write
my friend and longtime collaborator, the London-based, peripatetic art curator Hans
Ulrich Obrist (known to all as HUO), and ask if there was anyone in Milan I should
know.

Once I was settled at the hotel, the phone began ringing and a procession of
leading Italian artists, designers, and architects called to request a meeting, including
Enzo Mari, the modernist artist and furniture designer; Alberto Garutti, whose aesthetic
strategies have inspired a dialogue between contemporary art, spectator, and public
space; and fashion designer Miuccia Prada, who “requests your presence for tea this
afternoon at Prada headquarters.” And thus, thanks to HUO, did the jet-lagged “great
American visionary thinker” stumble and mumble his way through his first day in Milan,
November 2011.

HUO is sui generis: He lives a twenty-four-hour day, sleeping (I guess) whenever,
and employing full-time assistants who work eight-hour shifts and are available to him
24/7. Over a recent two-year period, he visited art venues in either China or India for
forty weekends each year—departing London Thursday evening, back at his desk on
Monday. Last year, once again, ArtReview ranked him #1 on their annual “Power 100”
list.

Recently we collaborated on a panel during the “GUEST, GHOST, HOST:
MACHINE!” Serpentine event that took place at London’s new City Hall. We were
joined by Venki Ramakrishnan, Jaan Tallinn, and Andrew Blake, research director of
The Alan Turing Institute. The event was consistent with HUO’s mission of bringing
together art and science: “The curator is no longer understood simply as the person who
fills a space with objects,” he says, “but also as the person who brings different cultural
spheres into contact, invents new display features, and makes junctions that allow
unexpected encounters and results.”

other complicated systems, even cultural or spiritual movements, to behave when
one or more important control parameters crosses a threshold. Doyne Farmer of the
Los Alamos’s Prediction Company once said about this vulnerability in complex
system, “Those things can hardly wait to roll up.” The /imit cycle lock-up occurs
most often as a sudden, discontinuous change, called a_ bifurcation, into
autonomous Sself-oscillations from an equilibrium state around which there was
some random variation. A bifurcation, a discontinuous change in outcome from a
smooth changes cause, characteristically occurs when the amount of an important
influence, a metabolic state, a drug, a psychodynamic conflict or level of emotional
stimulation crosses some critical value. The switch from one type of dynamical
behavior to another looks like the system has suddenly changed into something
else with an entirely new kind of life of its own. In the new life of rolled up, locked-up
repetitious motion, almost all new starting conditions follow pathways that lead into
the same limit cycle pattern. Evangelical Christians talk about a// born again life
being in Jesus, fixed in a complete set of moral, social and political beliefs, ideas
and judgments. The limit cycle gets its name because the end state of the orbits of
almost all starting points of the dynamics winds up being drawn into the same fixed,
repetitious pattern of a stable cycle. Visualizing the simulation of one kind of
bifurcation to a limit cycle on a computer screen, we see a slightly jiggling point
explode suddenly into an orbit of ceaseless rotations around a circle.

Ralph Abraham, the University of California at Santa Cruz pioneer in
graphical approaches to nonlinear systems, describes, cinemagraphically, the
emergence of limit cycles from a single point. He starts with a picture of an attractor
of water flow in the shape of a basin. All water that enters the basin, rolls down its
sides to the bottom, to what physicists say represents a potential energy minimum.
A little more technically, this attractor basin is composed of the set of all points such
that the orbits that flow from them tend to end up inside the basin as time goes
toward infinity, no matter where they start. Changing the value of a control
parameter of the system changes the shape of this basin-like landscape, of the

surface of the systems dynamical actions called a manifold, which can intuitively

That Friday morning, he came down from the residence into the
Oval Office in a full-on rage so violent that, for a moment, his hair came
undone. To the shock of the people with him, there stood an almost
entirely bald Donald Trump.

The president’s sudden change of heart sent the entire Republican
Party into a panic. If Trump carried out his threat not to sign the bill, he
would bring on what they most feared: a shutdown. And he might well
blame the shutdown on his own party.

Mark Meadows, the head of the House Freedom Caucus and a |

staunch Trump ally in Congress, called the president from Europe to say
that after the vote on Thursday afternoon most members had left town for
the congressional recess. Congress wouldn't be able to undo the previous
day’s vote, and the shutdown was due to commence in mere hours.

Mitch McConnell rushed Defense Secretary Jim Mattis into action to
tell the president that American soldiers would not be paid the next day if
he didn't sign the bill. This was a repeat performance: Mattis had issued a
similar warning during a threatened shutdown in January.

“Never... never... never... again; Trump shouted, pounding the
desk after each “never.”

Once again he caved and agreed to sign the bill. But he vowed that
next time there would be billions upon billions for the Wall or there really
would be a shutdown. Really. Really.

Bannon had been here before, so many times.

“Dude, he’s Donald fucking Trump,’ said Bannon, holding his head
and sitting at his table in the Embassy the day after the president signed
the bill.

Bannon was not confused: he had a clear understanding of how great
a liability Trump could be to Bannon’s own vision and career. To the ner-
vous titers of the people around him, Bannon believed he was the man of
populist destiny and not Donald Trump.

The urgency here was real. Bannon believed he represented the
workingman against the corporate-governmental-technocratic machine
whose constituency was the college-educated. In Bannon’s romantic view,

the workingman smelled of cigarettes, crushed your hand in his, and was
hard as brick—and not from working out in a gym. This remembrance
of things past, of (if it ever existed) a leveled world where a workingmar
was proud of his work and identity, was inspiring, Bannon believed, :
global anger. It was a revolution—this worldwide unease and fear anc
day-by-day upending of liberal assumptions—and it was his. The globa
hegemon was in his sights. He was the man behind the curtain—and h
might as well be in front of it, too—trying to snatch the world back fron
its postmodern anomie and restore something like the homogenized an:
neighborly embrace of 1962.

And China! And the coming Gétterdammerung! To Bannon, thi
was way-of-life stuff. China was the Russia of 1962—but smarter, mor
tenacious, and more threatening. American hedge funders, in their secre
support of China against the interests of the American middle class, wet
the new fifth column.

How much of this did Trump understand? How much was Trum
committed to the ideas that moved Bannon and, by some emotion
osmosis, the base? Trump was more than a year in, and not a shovelful

In late March, after the gloom of the budget bill disaster had lifted, the

1982 Lebanon War, with two sons fighting on the ground, he’d been a rare voice of
common sense, and caution, in the Begin cabinet. I’d also seen him operate in
Shamir’s inner security cabinet, when I would come, as deputy chief of staff, to
present military operations for approval. I remember one occasion when an air
force general laid out the details of a planned helicopter-borne mission into
Lebanon. I added a few remarks in summary. Raful Eitan and Arik Sharon were
both ministers. Within seconds, they were peppering the general and me with
questions. Why were the aircraft taking one route north instead of another? Why
not closer to Mount Hermon? Shouldn’t they fly lower? Levy interrupted.
“Gentlemen,” he said, “we are not in company commanders’ course. We’re in the
inner cabinet of the government of Israel. We have a chief of staff and other
generals and military professionals. It’s their job to decide the operational details.
Our job is to balance the reasons for doing an operation against the risks as
presented to us.”

I met with him in the Knesset cafeteria before Bibi went off to the Wye River
summit. Levy now headed a small breakaway faction from Likud called Gesher,
Hebrew for “bridge.” Without explicitly suggesting we join forces, I explained my
hope to run my eventual campaign for Prime Minister in alliance with a few other
parties. I told him I wanted to make my candidacy a legitimate choice for voters
from the center-right, the Orthodox, as well as the Russian community. I took a
napkin and drew a big umbrella to illustrate what I had in mind. He said he
understood — though he did tell me to make sure I tore up the napkin. There came a
point, at the end of November when it looked like my overture had failed.
Scampering for a way to shore up his coalition, Bibi tried to lure Levy into the fold
back by offering him the Finance Ministry. But with resistance from other
ministers, Bibi broke off the talks with Levy, leaving him humiliated and furious. I
met with him several more times, and we brought in Gesher as our first “One
Israel” partner. The second to join us, early in the new year, was a small religious
party called Meimad, inspired by an openly pro-peace Orthodox rabbi named
Yehuda Amital and including a former Chief Rabbi of Norway, Michael Melchior.

By the end of January 1999, several months before the real campaign, I was
feeling better about where we stood, in part because of a series of hits Bibi was
taking from former friends and allies. The first salvo was fired by Misha Arens,
who had helped engineer Bibi’s move into national politics. He announced he was
going to put himself forward for the Likud leadership before the election, saying

the 59pct ethic Russian makeup. Sunday/ Monday sanction rhetoric from ranging from g8 expulsion to Iran-style bank embargo is

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025034.txt,"All beha vior is instructive. That is, we teach others how to treat us. The game of guilt, along with other
Control Factor tools, teaches our Enemy it is winning and to continue playing.

FP: The reason Nidal Hasan was able to perpetrate his murder spree at Fort Hood is precisely because of
our Control Factor. Please connect the dots for our readers.

Siegel: Just as I used to look at Hitler when I was young and be amazed that no one could see what he was
about, in retrospect the same applies to Hasan. It is precisely all the elements of the Control Factor that
could allow this man, a Soldier of Allah, to be positioned as he was. He was blatantly voicing his Islamist
views and Jihadi intent including, even, an essay recommending the “painful liquidation” of non-Muslims.
Yet, in the Army of all places, the Control Factor operated to allow and even foster his work. Even after the
murders, we cont inue the denial by calling it “workplace violence.” He is the Civilization-Violent Jihad
combo! And we continue to enable the same infiltration elsewhere.

FP: Tell our readers about “The Project” and “Explanatory Memorandum.” These are realities that serve as
great threats to the Control Factor, right?

Siegel: These are separate sets of documents that outline the Muslim Brotherhood’s goals and

plans underlying the Civilization Jihad. The former was discovered in Europe and extends globally. The
1991 Explanatory Memorandum emerged in 2008 from the Holy Land Foundation trial and describes the
Brotherhood’s work in America as a “Civilization-Jihadist Process with all the word means” and “a kind of
grand Jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and ‘sabotaging’ its
miserable house by their own hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and God’s religion
is made victorious over all other religions.”

Much as the communists of the Soviet Union had formulated in the 1950s a detailed long term plan to
destroy America (many of the effects of which we are seeing of late including destroying the

nuclear family, secularizing the nation, feminizing men ...) these documents identify many strategies to
infiltrate while eroding the foundations of our civilization in order to transform it into an Islamic one. The
Control Factor has many ingenious ways to convince us that this is ridiculous, that our courts and system
would never allow such a thing, that one is racist or “Islamophobic,” if not insane, for even thinking this is
real. And just as with the communists, time is plentiful. Even more so with our Islamic Enemy, a multi-
decade plan is short term. It is not critical that a seriou sly engaged Muslim lives to see the result. It is
critical, more correctly a duty, however, that he carries on his Jihad. Patrick Poole and The Center for
Security Policy’s Team B Report, Shariah: The Threat to America, are excellent sources for your readers to
pursue these documents.

FP: And so what you call an “Inner Jihad” has to start. It’s our, as you say, mandatory “addiction
treatment.” Please explain.

Siegel: The “Inner Jihad” is the effort we must undertake to gain control over our Control Factors. There is
a famous Hadith in which Mohammad, returning from a successful battle, essentially says that the physical
fight was the “lesser Jihad” and it is time to then attend to the “greater Jihad €”- that internal battle against
our own internal appetites, lusts, wrong thinking and so forth. While that Hadith has been falsely utilized to
say that “Jihad” is not violent, it is useful to us as a symbol of the vicious effort we must take internally
against our own Control Factor tendencies.

As I said earlier, the Control Factor is “active” and “continuous” so we must constantly monitor and combat
it. Like “Whack-a-Mole,” just as we may think we have addressed it, another variation pops right up. I use
the terms “addict” and “enabler” because we truly need a form of rehab to break the habitual power of the
Control Factor and because our relationship with our Islamic Enemy is very much like that between a
typical addict and his enabler. And just as it is so difficult for an addict to kick his habit, so does the enabler
act essentially addicted to his behavior and find it so difficult to change. At its core, the relati onship
involves the transfer of responsibility for our Islamic Enemy’s hate and resultant actions onto us with our
response framed essentially as an effort to do what we can to try to address the Enemy’s grievance. (Your
book, United in Hate, describes this addiction to hate in detail.

Where would you be without GPS?

Perhaps carrying fewer gadgets: The technology is being added to shoes, MP3 players, dogs

By Carolyn Y. Johnson | Boston Globe | February 19, 2007

This month, GTX Corp. launched a line of Xplorer Smart GPS shoes that transform sneakers into
a wearable LoJack system.

ABI Research found that the number of people in North America who subscribe to GPS-enabled
location-based services more than doubled between 2005 and 2006, from 1.6 to 3.9 million. The
number of subscribers is projected to rocket to 52 million in 2011.

That means companies working in what used to be a niche market have been enjoying explosive
growth. Revenues at TomTom NV, a Concord-based maker of personal navigation products, have
increased more than 500-fold since 2001, from $2.5 million to an estimated $1.7 billion last

year. Garmin's business has exploded into the mainstream, too, and the company ran its first
Super Bowl ad this year. Boston-based start-up Skyhook Wireless brings location awareness to
any device with WiFi, and announced a major partnership this month with GPS platform maker

SiRF.

January 29, 2007 - We’ve written several times about the concept of electronically fencing dogs
and cats for their safety, or the safety of others. Similarly, as GPS technologies have become
commercially viable, of tracking assets and loved ones to ensure their safety. Now personal
location services company GTXC Corporation, is set to unveil a line of Xplorer Smart GPS shoes
at the World Shoe Association (WSA) in Las Vegas on February 1 which offer a range of new
opportunities. Xplorer shoes incorporate a small and robust GPS tracking device which hooks up

with GTXC's internet user portal to offer a very compelling array of personal location services.

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024409.txt,"Similarly, the sense of control must be continuously maintained so the Control Factor operates constantly. In
turn, the sum of this active and continuous undertaking makes these perceptions all the more familiar and thus
seemingly all the more “real.” In one sense, the Control Factor is the mechanism of what Andy McCarthy
entitled one of his numerous excellent books- willful blindness. The Control Factor is cleverer than we are
aware; that is almost tautological as, if our minds are to create ways to keep us in denial, they must out
maneuver our conscious thinking.

Since World War II, America has had limited experience with threats coming to the homeland. Most of
America’s history has been about “over there,” where we have always known that if things got too out of
hand (e.g. Vietnam) we could always ret urn home. The current generations, for a wide array of reasons, have
had virtually no experience with a threat to this land. (The documentary, Generation Zero, is interesting on
this point).

Consequently, the process of waking up to such a threat parallels the arc of a typical horror film. In such a
film, there is typically a cast of characters surrounding one or two main characters. We in the audience know
there is a threat coming — be it a monster, a virus, a psycho killer, an alien, the blob that ate Cincinnati etc.
This threat is typically defined by its intent- the singular goal of destroying the characters. Much of the initial
exposition shows how the characters first are oblivious to the destruction the threat brings about, then explain
it in familiar terms only to finally open their eyes to see that something uniquely terrifying is happening. The
next stage usually involves a series of failed attempts to deal with the threat- fr om trying to negotiate with it,
to appease it, to coax it, to threaten it with ineffective weapons and so forth. Most of these failings are due to
not adequately appreciating the threat for what it truly is and projecting onto it a host of other attributes
instead. The final stage generally involves a back-up-against-the-wall decision by whichever characters
remain alive. I named this the “turnaround moment” when the character becomes willing to be as ruthless as
the threat. That change in mental state is necessary to ensure survival. Ultimately, the storyline is a race for
whichever characters remain to wake up fully and use whatever advantages they may still have to beat the
threat.

This is the same arc our minds go through in battling our own Control Factors, our own compulsions to deny
that which is staring us in the face. Ultimately, the question is whether we will be able to wake up while we
still have advantages and give ourselves permis sion to fully fight the battle we are in.

I said ear lier that there is a structure to the Control Factor. To oversimplify, I view it much as a pyramid
where on the bottom are the many minute by minute thoughts that are manipulated. I call this level of
maneuvers the many ”D’s” as they include the psychological defenses such as distortion, denial,
demonization, deflection, deletion, detachment, delusion, displacement, discolorization and so forth. Layered
upon these are moves such as projection, where we can assign to our Islamic Enemy traits we wish to see in
them or introject traits from them into ourselves that we wish not to acknowledge. These maneuvers involve a
mixing of identities where we actually lose clarity about who we are and who the enemy is. Projection and
introjection are active almost across the board. It is always helpful, for instance, to ask how what the enemy
accuses us of is more appropriately descriptive of it. When we add Western Guilt and Shame, our need to be
liked, and o ther psychological dimensions, basic thoughts solidify into larger fantasies.

As these narratives (“Our courts will never allow that,” “As a superpower we will always be able to win any
fight we put our minds to,” “Assimilation will ensure Muslims are westernized” ...) gain consent from others
they tend to guide us deeply and become infused on our policies. Ultimately, what emerges is a relationship
we take with our Islamic Enemy that parallels that between an addict and an enabler. Emblematic of this
relationship is the “transfer of responsibility” in which we assume responsibility for the enemy’s behavior
who is addicted to transferring it away from itself. The Control Factor actively maintains this relationship and
makes changing that relationship as difficult a chore as any addict finds in breaking his addiction. And just as
an addict needs to devote serious effort and con sciousness to his addiction, so must we devote great energy to
unders tanding how the Control Factor ultimately sabotages us.

FP: Describe the threat we face in our Islamic enemy. And you talk about the three levels of jihad against us.
What are they?

Attempted Murders: Killing a Corpse and the “Abraham Defense”

A case that involved both science and logic arose in the context of the attempted murder
prosecution of a young man who had shot a corpse, believing that it was still alive. The case
presented a series of perplexing scientific and logical riddles: When is a person who has been
mortally wounded actually dead? Can you kill a man who is already dead? If not, can you
attempt to kill a man who is already dead if you believe he is still alive.

My client had watched one acquaintance, who was having a disagreement with another
acquaintance, shoot him in the heart. The shooter then asked my client to shoot the victim in the
head, which he did. On the first appeal, which I argued in Brooklyn, the court reversed the
murder conviction on the basis of scientific evidence that it was impossible to know whether the
victim was alive or dead at the moment my client shot him in the head, since someone else had
shot him in the heart just moments earlier. It ruled that the prosecution had not satisfied its
burden of proving he was still alive when my client’s bullet shattered his brain. The court also
ruled that my client could not be convicted of attempted murder, on the ground that since it is
factually impossible to murder a corpse; it is also legally impossible to attempt to do that which it
is factually impossible to do. On the second appeal, which I argued in Albany, the court agreed
that my client could not be convicted of murder because “man dies but once,” but it concluded
that he should be convicted of attempted murder. I then brought a federal Habeus Corpus
petition, and the federal court threw out the attempted murder conviction as well. My client went
free. This intriguing case, which I wrote about in more detail Zhe Best Defense, is taught today in
many law schools as part of the standard course on criminal law. The issue of whether it is legally
possible to attempt to do what is factually impossible—namely to kill a dead person—continues
to confound new generations of law students.

Another attempted murder case presented a problem right out of the Bible. My client was
accused of attempting to kill his sister’s former boyfriend. The boyfriend was suspected of
burning down the sister’s house and burning her severely. She ultimately died of her painful
burns, but while she was still alive, my client went to her former boyfriend’s home, held a knife
over his chest and said he would kill him unless he admitted his role in the fire. The police burst
into the apartment and disarmed my client before he could stab the former boyfriend. My client
was convicted of attempting to kill the former boyfriend, and I was retained to argue the appeal.

I analogized the situation to the one described in the Book of Genesis when God told Abraham to
sacrifice Isaac, and Abraham stood, knife in hand, ready to inflict the fatal wound when God’s
angel came down and stopped him. I argued that we can never really know whether my client
would actually have killed the boyfriend had the police not intervened, just as we can never know
for sure whether Abraham would actually have complied with God’s command. There were other
issues in the case as well and we won the appeal. The state declined to re-prosecute and this
client too went free.

father took some regular pleasure in pointing out that they were in the back of the room
when God handed out brains—but, then again, Trump tended to scorn anyone who might
be smarter than he was. Their sister Ivanka, certainly no native genius, was the designated
family smart person, her husband Jared the family’s smooth operator. That left Don and
Eric to errands and admin. In fact, the brothers had grown into reasonably competent
family-owned-company executives (this is not saying all that much) because their father
had little or no patience for actually running his company. Of course, quite a good amount
of their professional time was spent on the whims, projects, promotions, and general way
of life of DJT.

One benefit of their father’s run for president was that it kept him away from the office.
Still, the campaign’s administration was largely their responsibility, so when the campaign
went from caprice to a serious development in the Trump business and family, it caused a
disruption in the family dynamic. Other people were suddenly eager to be Donald Trump’s
key lieutenants. There were the outsiders, like Corey Lewandowski, the campaign
manager, but there was also the insider, brother-in-law Jared. Trump, not unusually for a
family-run company, made everybody compete for his favor. The company was about
him; it existed because of his name, personality, and charisma, so the highest standing in
the company was reserved for those who could best serve him. There wasn’t all that much
competition for this role before he ran for president, but in early 2016, with the
Republican Party collapsing and Trump rising, his sons faced a new professional and
family situation.

Their brother-In-law had been slowly drawn into the campaign, partly at his wife’s
urging because her father’s lack of constraint might actually affect the Trump business if
they didn’t keep an eye on him. And then he, with his brothers-in-law, was pulled in by the
excitement of the campaign itself. By late spring 2016, when the nomination was all but
clinched, the Trump campaign was a set of competing power centers with the knives out.

Lewandowski regarded both brothers and their brother-in-law with rolling-on-the-floor
contempt: not only were Don Jr. and Eric stupid, and Jared somehow both supercilious
and obsequious (the butler), but nobody knew a whit about politics—indeed, there wasn’t
an hour of political experience among them.

As time went on, Lewandowski became particularly close to the candidate. To the
family, especially to Kushner, Lewandowski was an enabler. Trump’s worst instincts
flowed through Lewandowski. In early June, a little more than a month before the
Republican National Convention, Jared and Ivanka decided that what was needed—for the
sake of the campaign, for the sake of the Trump business—was an intervention.

Making common cause with Don Jr. and Eric, Jared and Ivanka pushed for a united
front to convince Trump to oust Lewandowski. Don Jr., feeling squeezed not only by
Lewandowski but by Jared, too, seized the opportunity. He would push out Lewandowski

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016388.txt,"Even the bright red line for human manipulation of human beings shows many
signs of moving or breaking completely. More than 2,300 approved clinical trials for
gene therapy are in progress worldwide. A major medical goal is the treatment or
prevention of cognitive decline, especially in light of our rapidly aging global
demographic. Some treatments of cognitive decline will include cognitive enhancements
(drugs, genes, cells, transplants, implants, and so on). These will be used off-label. The
rules of athletic competition (e.g., banning augmentation with steroids or erythropoietin)
do not apply to intellectual competition in the real world. Every bit of progress on
cognitive decline is in play for off-label use.

Another frontier of the human use of humans is “brain organoids.” We can now
accelerate developmental biology. Processes that normally take months can happen in
four days in the lab using the right recipes of transcription factors. We can make brains
that, with increasing fidelity, recapitulate the differences between people born with
aberrant cognitive abilities (e.g., microcephaly). Proper vasculature (veins, arteries, and
capillaries) missing from earlier successes are now added, enabling brain organoids to
surpass the former sub-microliter limit to possibly exceed the 1.2-liter size of modern
human brains (or even the 5-liter elephant or 8-liter sperm whale brains).

Conventional Computers versus Bio-electronic Hybrids

As Moore’s Law miniaturization approaches its next speed bump (surely not a solid
wall), we see the limits of the stochastics of dopant atoms in silicon slabs and the limits
of beam-fabrication methods at around 10-nanometer feature size. Power (energy
consumption) issues are also apparent: The great Watson, winner of Jeopardy!, used
85,000 watts real time, while the human brains were using 20 watts each. To be fair, the
human body needs 100 watts to operate and twenty years to build, hence about 6 trillion
joules of energy to “manufacture” a mature human brain. The cost of manufacturing
Watson-scale computing is similar. So why aren’t humans displacing computers?

For one, the Jeopardy! contestants’ brains were doing far more than information
retrieval—much of which would be considered mere distractions by Watson (e.g.,
cerebellar control of smiling). Other parts allow leaping out of the box with
transcendence unfathomable by Watson, such as what we see in Einstein’s five annus
mirabilis papers of 1905. Also, humans consume more energy than the minimum (100
W) required for life and reproduction. People in India use an average of 700 W per
person; it’s 10,000 W in the U.S. Both are still less than the 85,000 watts Watson uses.
Computers can become more like us via neuromorphic computing, possibly a
thousandfold. But human brains could get more efficient, too. The organoid brain-in-a-
bottle could get closer to the 20 W limit. The idiosyncratic advantages of computers for
math, storage, and search, faculties of limited use to our ancestors, could be designed and
evolved anew in labs.

Facebook, the National Security Agency, and others are constructing exabyte-
scale storage facilities at more than a megawatt and four hectares, while DNA can store
that amount in a milligram. Clearly, DNA is not a mature storage technology, but with
Microsoft and Technicolor doubling down on it, we would be wise to pay attention. The
main reason for the 6 trillion joules of energy required to get a productive human mind is
the twenty years required for training.

Time Consumers: Batch and Do Not Falter

A schedule defends from chaos and whim.
— ANNIE DILLARD, winner of Pulitzer Prize in nonfiction, 1975

IF you have never used a commercial printer before, the pricing and lead times could surprise you.

Let’s assume it costs $310 and takes one week to print 20 customized T-shirts with 4-color logos. How
much and how long does it take to print 3 of the same T-shirt?

$310 and one week.

How is that possible? Simple—the setup charges don’t change. It costs the printer the same amount in
materials for plate preparation ($150) and the same in labor to man the press itself ($100). The setup is
the real time-consumer, and thus the job, despite its small size, needs to be scheduled just like the other,
resulting in the same one-week delivery date. The lower economy of scale picks up the rest: The cost for
3 shirts is $20 per shirt x 3 shirts instead of $3 per shirt x 20 shirts.

The cost- and time-effective solution, therefore, is to wait until you have a larger order, an approach
called “batching.” Batching is also the solution to our distracting but necessary time consumers, those
repetitive tasks that interrupt the most important.

If you check mail and make bill payments five times a week, it might take 30 minutes per instance and
you respond to a total of 20 letters in two and a half hours. If you do this once per week instead, it might
take 60 minutes total and you still respond to a total of 20 letters. People do the former out of fear of
emergencies. First, there are seldom real emergencies. Second, of the urgent communication you will
receive, missing a deadline is usually reversible and otherwise costs a minimum to correct.

There is an inescapable setup time for all tasks, large or minuscule in scale. It is often the same for one
as it is for a hundred. There is a psychological switching of gears that can require up to 45 minutes to

resume a major task that has been interrupted. More than a quarter of each 9-5 period (28%) is
consumed by such interruptions.

This is true of all recurring tasks and is precisely why we have already decided to check e-mail and
phone calls twice per day at specific predetermined times (between which we let them accumulate).

From mid-2004 to 2007, I checked mail no more than once a week, often not for up to four weeks at a
time. Nothing was irreparable, and nothing cost more than $300 to fix. This batching has saved me
hundreds of hours of redundant work. How much is your time worth?

Let’s use a hypothetical example:

1. $20 per hour is how much you are paid or value your time. This would be the case, for example, if you

He dismissed the argument that Syria was not facing a conspiracy.
There was a conspiracy, he declared — designed abroad and
perpetrated inside the country. How else to explain the satellite
phones, the advanced weapons, the guns mounted on trucks in the
hands of his enemies? Syria had always been a target of conspiracy.
He had long been under pressure to abandon his principles. (No
doubt, by this he meant his Arab nationalist convictions, his alliance
with Iran and Hizbullah, his opposition to Israel and the United
States.) Syria needed to strengthen its immunity against such
conspiracies, he insisted.

In this defiant speech, President Asad made no mention of the abuses
of his security services -- the callous use of live fire against civilians,
the killing of well over a thousand protesters, the deployment of tanks
to besiege rebellious cities, the mass arrests, the beatings and the
torture, the flight of terrified refugees across Syria’s borders -- a
catalogue of outrages which has shattered Syria’s reputation and
earned it international condemnation. The refugees in Turkey should
return home, he said. They would not be punished. The army would
protect them. But those who have had a taste of army brutality may
not be persuaded by the President’s assurances. He did, however,
have a word of condolence for bereaved mothers.

The heart of Asad’s address was a statement of his ambition to shape
a new vision for Syria’s future. Reform, he declared, was his firm
conviction. His one big idea -- the centrepiece of his speech -- was a
plan for a National Dialogue. A special authority had been set up to
work out the necessary arrangements for this great debate, which he
hoped would provide for the widest possible popular participation.

smile in response, suggesting that such diagnoses were probably best left to the
professionals. I couldn’t pretend, however, that emotional engagement with new
acquaintances, even with people I knew and liked but were not close friends,
was something that came naturally. And it is also true that from my first
experience of the world of numbers as a child on the kibbutz, and as I tackled
ever more elaborate pieces on the piano, I did become aware of what might be
called the upside of “a touch of Aspergers” — if that, indeed, is what it is. I was
conscious of the ease with which my brain translated the complexities into
pictures in my mind. And the joy, at times, with which it allowed me to play
around with, and develop, what I saw.

By the summer of 1967, I had experienced that feeling again, in my first real
encounter with theoretical physics at Hebrew University. After the Six-Day
War, I began seriously contemplating a future as a research scientist, or perhaps
eventually a professor of physics. Two months after the war, I enrolled in a
summer program at the Weizmann Institute, Israel’s preeminent postgraduate
research facility. Surrounded by some of the country’s, even the world’s,
leading scientists, and by post-doctoral students determined to follow in their
footsteps, was intellectually enthralling. But it turned out to have another effect
on me as well. As I thought more and more about the prospect of joining their
fraternity once I’d completed my undergraduate degree, I also heard them
describe the way in which pure science sometimes got submerged in simple
routine, or, more discouragingly, in the politics and positioning and backbiting
of the academic world.

I think what finally changed my mind, however, was a feeling, nurtured on
the kibbutz but solidified by that many nights I’d spent leading sayeret
operations across our borders, that I would find my true purpose in life trying to
make some special contribution to the future course of Israel. I did not for a
moment contemplate politics at that point. Instead, I thought of going back into
the military. I realized that in order to make a significant mark, if indeed I
could, would require me to serve in the regular army, not just an extraordinary
unit like Sayeret Matkal. But I did hope that, at some stage, I’d be given the
opportunity to finish my time in the sayeret as its commander, carrying on
Avraham’s vision and, ideally, building and expanding on it as well. At least if
that part proved possible, I felt that, by comparison, a career in academia would
be somehow blinkered, and surely less fulfilling personally. My sayeret
experience had also taught me something else as well: that protecting Israel’s
security was not just a matter of muscle, or firepower, indispensible though they

OBSERVATIONS — INDIVIDUAL TAXES

Under the Act, there will be winners and losers on the personal income tax side. Generally, wage earners from
no-tax states... could see tax savings under the Act. For instance, a Florida taxpayer earning $1 million with
moderate itemized deductions may see a tax savings of about $30,000 under the Act. A similar taxpayer in New
York State may see a savings of about $3,500 according to our preliminary analysis..©

Conversely, very high-wage earners from high-tax states could see a higher tax bill. A taxpayer earning $3 million
in New York City may see a significant tax increase: $44,000 under the Act, due in part to the loss of significant
deductions. A similar taxpayer in Florida would see a tax savings of about $91,000 under the Act (primarily due
to the lower top rate, elongated 35% tax bracket and regaining itemized deductions that are no longer phased-
out), according to our preliminary analysis.

Married couples could fare worse than two single taxpayers with a similar amount of income. The so-called
marriage penalty hits particularly hard under the new tax brackets. The penalty is also exacerbated by permitting
married couples only a $10,000 state income/real estate tax deduction, but allowing each of two single filers a
deduction in the same amount ($20,000 combined). Under the changes, a single taxpayer with $500,000 of wages

or other method. , you might be able to make blacks smarter by changing the time for motor layer

the layers. . as you talked about culling the unused neurons in each layer, each neuron in each layer would
get dfferent ( kill yourself if you are not being used instructions ).

Exactly. I looked up the statistics, black kids in the US have slower cognitive development (and never catch
up), which the study of course attributed to social factors without any evidence, and they had faster motor
development! I suspect this means their brains are slower at learning high-level concepts, because the low-
level structures are optimized for a shorter time. But they will keep the lead in motor development, because it
is easier to learn, and they have more time and attention to practice once they get the structures in place.

It could also be that they have an additional set of learning directives in place that adapts them better to a
more hunting/running style of life, whereas the Europeans had to adapt for identifying long-term seasonal
patterns, delayed gratification for agriculture etc.

and CONCEPTS could be layer to layer communicaiton. . are gender differences also a matter of time ,
and structure of interactions. .

I suspect gender differences are mostly motivational, i.e. we have a reward system for all the different social
and cognitive needs, which makes us receive different kinds of pleasure and pain, thereby pay attention and
learn. You cannot learn what does not attract your attention. Women tend to find abstract systems, conflicts
and mechanisms intrinsically boring. Most women in computer science do not write programs because they
enjoy solving puzzles, but because they want to help people, get approval etc. There are almost no women in
math, because it does not help people or yield social attention.

Men tend to find elaborate social relations boring. If there is no pleasure in observing and empathizing with
people, one will not have good social cognition.

IQ is not the only meaningful difference. Chinese pay an inordinate amount of attention to authority. I suspect
historically., the authorities tended to kill them a lot if they did not. Jews tend be intellectually independent
and anti-authoritarian, which might make them creative and inventive in ways that are hard to find in Asia.

At the moment, I think speed/quality of brain development plus motivational system are the key to
understanding both mind and individual differences. Important part of human language might be the result in
a motivational need to discover/invent grammatical structure, which as a side effect makes us interested in
music.

It would mean that Chomsky’s life long hypothesis, that people have a special circuit for grammatical
language, is wrong. They might be GENERAL learners, just like Gorillas, but with a strong motivational urge
to build grammatical structure, which the brain simply invents (there are only a few ways in which a natural
language can work). That is much easier to wire into a brain than a specific circuit.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016830.txt,"scientists are doing science, especially in such data-intensive sciences as sociology and
epidemiology, for which causal models have become a second language. These
disciplines view their linguistic transformation as the Causal Revolution. As Harvard
social scientist Gary King puts it, “More has been learned about causal inference in the
last few decades than the sum total of everything that had been learned about it in all
prior recorded history.”

As I contemplate the success of machine learning and try to extrapolate it to the
future of AI, I ask myself, “Are we aware of the basic limitations that were discovered in
the causal-inference arena? Are we prepared to circumvent the theoretical impediments
that prevent us from going from one level of the hierarchy to another level?”

I view machine learning as a tool to get us from data to probabilities. But then we
still have to make two extra steps to go from probabilities into real understandingnce—
two big steps. One is to predict the effect of actions, and the second is counterfactual
imagination. We cannot claim to understand reality unless we make the last two steps.

In his insightful book Foresight and Understanding (1961), the philosopher
Stephen Toulmin identified the transparency-versus-opacity contrast as the key to
understanding the ancient rivalry between Greek and Babylonian sciences. According to
Toulmin, the Babylonian astronomers were masters of black-box predictions, far
surpassing their Greek rivals in accuracy and consistency of celestial observations. Yet
Science favored the creative-speculative strategy of the Greek astronomers, which was
wild with metaphorical imagery: circular tubes full of fire, small holes through which
celestial fire was visible as stars, and hemispherical Earth riding on turtleback. It was
this wild modeling strategy, not Babylonian extrapolation, that jolted Eratosthenes (276-
194 BC) to perform one of the most creative experiments in the ancient world and
calculate the circumference of the Earth. Such an experiment would never have occurred
to a Babylonian data-fitter.

Model-blind approaches impose intrinsic limitations on the cognitive tasks that
Strong Al can perform. My general conclusion is that human-level AI cannot emerge
solely from model-blind learning machines; it requires the symbiotic collaboration of
data and models.

Data science is a science only to the extent that it facilitates the interpretation of
data—a two-body problem, connecting data to reality. Data alone are hardly a science,
no matter how “big” they get and how skillfully they are manipulated. Opaque learning
systems may get us to Babylon, but not to Athens.

Summary
To save you the agony of plodding through this fascinating, information-rich paper, I’ll get straight to the point: Donald Trump
will be the next President of the United States after having won an easy victory over Hillary Clinton in November 2016. The
reasons:
I.)
II.)
III.)
Section one shows that the essential characteristics of the narrative for the Trump campaign and the Reagan campaign
of 1980 are surprisingly similar, which would point to a Trump landslide.
Section two describes the poor state of the current economy using detrended GDP per adult, the ratio of employmentto-adult-population
and new home sales per 1,000 adults and how these measures strongly indicate a Republican
victory.
Using historical data for the Gallup poll question “are you satisfied” and presidential election dates, this section would
point to an overwhelming Republican win in November 2016.
IV.) Relying on voter turnout data this year versus earlier years and party selection, the Republicans have a large advantage
coming into the Fall election.
V.)
Basing our forecast on the past eight years of Congressional elections—House and Senate—as well as state elections
of house, senate and governors, the Republicans should be exceedingly confident about the upcoming presidential
election.
VI.) Taking careful measure of what both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have done in the public eye, Trump has the
issues on his side.
I. 1979-1980 How the Reagan Revolution Began
In early 1979, a group of Ronald Reagan acolytes—some 10 to 15 in total—got together in Justin Dart’s office at Rexall (the
corner of La Cienega and Beverly) and there they formed the original Reagan Executive Advisory Committee. With very few
exceptions (initially only me), this group had been called Reagan’s Kitchen Cabinet. Those present and those also invited
included Justin Dart, Holmes Tuttle, Jack Wrather, Bill French Smith, Bill Wilson, Earle Jorgensen, Ben Biaggini, Ted
Cummings, Alfred Bloomingdale, Charles Wick, Henry Salvatori et moi. I was the youngest of the group by three decades.
And, in fact, the only way Justin Dart could convince the others to let me be a member was that they needed someone to keep
the minutes of the meetings, i.e. as a secretary. In speaking with a reporter about the Kitchen Cabinet, here’s what Jus Dart
had to say: “In addressing the question of how many of Reagan's friends actually qualify as members, Dart said: ‘Damn fewer
than is generally advertised.’” 1 That just says it all.
The purpose of this committee was to provide guidance and support to the emerging presidential candidacy of one Ronald
Reagan. The members were to a person close, close, close friends and supporters of Ronald Reagan or husbands of Nancy
Reagan’s best friends. And the race for the White House began.
During this pre-primary and primary process, Ronald Reagan was disrespected and abused by a significant segment of the
Republican establishment. 2 He was called an empty suit, a trigger-happy California cowboy, only an actor, a person who
spoke words others wrote, a racist, a bigot, a divorcée, a war monger and the man who would start the Third World War. My
favorite slur came from none other than the Democratic Party’s “éminence grise” Clark Clifford, 3 who referred to Ronald
Reagan as an “amiable dunce.” The torrent of anti-Reagan epithets never stopped.

As if receiving divine retribution for his nasty ways, Clark Clifford, who served as Secretary of Defense for President Johnson and as an advisor to
Presidents Truman, Kennedy and Carter, was indicted in the early 1990s on charges of conspiracy, fraud and bribery surrounding the Bank of Credit
and Commerce International scandal.

In fact, the whole group of us received virtually no support from the Republican Party or the Party’s elders. It wasn’t until
Reagan had finally defeated George Bush, along with John Connally, Howard Baker, Phil Crane, Bob Dole and John Anderson
in the primary race, that there was any attempt to be conciliatory to Ronald Reagan’s presidential campaign by the Republican
powers that were. Even Barry Goldwater, whose career owed so much to Ronald Reagan, was cool at best to a Reagan
presidency.
I remember one post-Bush-defeat meeting of our committee when we had already secured the nomination and George Herbert
Walker Bush sat next to me and lightly apologized for referring to me as the “Voo-Doo Economist.” In truth, I had sort of
enjoyed the handle, and told H.W. Bush that I was delighted he finally had come to join us because I needed some fellow
Yalies to up the quality of our group. He laughed.
Things had been so vitriolic and bad during the primary campaign that a number of Republicans couldn’t in clear conscience
support Ronald Reagan at all and others could only support him in name only. And one of the primary contestants, John
Anderson, Republican Congressman from Illinois, was so offended by Ronald Reagan’s nomination that he decided to run as
an independent in the general election, which he did. While, in hindsight, John Anderson’s decision may now seem like a nonevent,
it sure wasn’t seen as a frivolous gesture back then. Ronald Reagan looked like a sure loser with both a moderate
Republican opponent and a sitting Democratic President, with all the privilege, prestige and power that the Office of the
President holds.
At the convention in Detroit City, I testified before the platform committee on what I thought Reaganomics would be—which
was lots of fun. But, the real drama occurred when it came time to select Ronald Reagan’s running mate. Showing no signs
of remorse or respect for the primary voters, the Party’s establishment conspired to browbeat Ronald Reagan into accepting
Gerald Ford as Ronald Reagan’s co-president running mate. They—the establishment—were absolutely certain that Ronald
Reagan would be blown away by Carter in November of 1980 and that the down ticket Republican candidates would get their
lunch handed to them. So much for the wisdom of Republican elders and insiders.
In other words, just like today in re Donald Trump, the party’s cognoscenti were forecasting a huge Reagan defeat that would
carry with it large numbers of House members and Senators. Reagan, they thought, would prove to be more devastating to
Republicans than either the Goldwater defeat of 1964 or the Ford defeat of 1976.
As you all know, none of this happened. We handily defeated Carter, even though we were behind in the polls as recently as
1 week before the election. 4 Reagan took 44 states and 50.7% of the popular vote to Carter’s 41% of the vote and Anderson’s
6.6% of the vote. Whodathunkit? I’m naturally an optimist, but I’ve never been more optimistic than I am today or than I was
in 1980, and I’ve never had more fun than I had in the several years before Ronald Reagan’s election. The Reagan saga of
1980 seems a lot like the Trump story today.
II. “It’s the Economy Stupid” – James Carville 1992
In the 2016 primaries, each and every Republican candidate promised lower tax rates, restrained government spending, sound
money and greatly lessened regulations. The mantra was repeal “Obamacare,” eviscerate Dodd-Frank and cut taxes. There
couldn’t have been a more supply-side, pro-growth field of candidates assembled in the entire history of our nation—not one
outlier. It almost became a Republican feeding frenzy as to who could propose the lowest tax rate and create the most growth.
Debates on economic issues were super boring and hyperbole as to who could be the most pro-growth supply sider infused
the air we breathe. In truth, every Republican, from Jim Gilmore to Donald Trump, understood that America was in free fall
and needed a huge dose of incentive alignments. There was very little room for debate on the issues because the candidates
all agreed with each other.
The Democrats, once O’Malley, Webb and Chafee exited stage left, were pulling each other further and further to the “Free
Lunch Tax the Rich” ticket. Already way over-subsidized, students were promised free college by Sanders, and America would
have a $15 federal minimum wage everywhere. And then there was expanded free health care, huge tax increases on Wall
Street exploiters and on the rich in general. The Walton family was singled out as the perfect example of what’s wrong with
America: one family whose net worth was close to $150 billion and whose legacy company, Walmart, paid workers’ wages so
low that full-time employees qualified for welfare. The Democrats defined their enemies as the most successful innovators,
investors, job-creators and employers in America.
The Democrats also, in their never-ending debates, careened further and further toward “from each according to his ability and
to each according to his need” paradise. The most enthusiastic crowds were energized by the endearing, wild-eyed,
septuagenarian Socialist whose unkempt, long white hair became emblematic of “enough is enough already”: Uncle Bernie
Sanders. Who doesn’t love Bernie Sanders? Or, as his throngs of acolytes scream, who doesn’t “feel the Bern?”

Reagan’s surge in polls is generally attributed to the presidential debate held one week before the election took place, on October 28 th , immediately
after which Reagan appears to have moved into a 3 point lead. See: Lydia Saad, “Late Upsets Are Rare, but Have Happened,” Gallup, October 27,

Hillary’s and Bernie’s kabuki dance is far from over. The continued Sanders’ humiliation and exposé of Clinton is profoundly
damaging to the Democrats’ prospects, while the Republicans have just chosen their candidate. Someone ought to tell that
to Bill Kristol.
What is patently obvious from the rise of Bernie Sanders and the massive, hard fought battle in the Republican primary is that
economic discontent is at an all-time high. The electorate wants economic change NOW.
But, then there’s Hillary Clinton’s take on the economy and the Obama record. Like Pat Buchanan’s protectionist niche some
20 years ago, there is a segment of America that truly likes the Obama record. But, that segment is not even close to being
large enough to elect a winner.
Hillary Clinton’s political and academic credentials are second to none—Wellesley undergraduate, Yale Law School,
Watergate trial activist, Rose Law firm lawyer, First Lady, Senator from New York, and President Obama’s Secretary of State.
She has been indefatigably toiling her way through the political superstructure to be the next President of the United States:
the incarnation of an Obama third term and protector of the Obama legacy. This tack that she has taken is helpful in the
Democratic primary, especially among African Americans, but is a very large mistake in a general election and reflects poorly
on her political judgement.
Judging from the three most important metrics of the economy: i.) detrended real nondefense GDP per adult from 1950 to the
present, ii.) employment as a share of adult population during the post-World War II period, and iii.) new housing sales per
1,000 adults over the past 55 years, anyone who runs on the Obama record is at a great, great, great disadvantage.
Just look at each of these three measures of economic performance:

Even when a president’s term ends on a high note, as was the case with Presidents Kennedy, Reagan and Clinton, it is a
challenge for the incumbent party to maintain the White House. Thus, given that detrended real nondefense GDP per adult as
a measure of our country’s economic performance has ended on very low notes for Obama, “W” Bush and Bush Sr., it is clear

Note: the gray vertical lines in figures throughout this paper represent the election dates of these individual presidents. The reason for this (rather
than placing vertical lines on inauguration dates) is that we’re using economic metrics throughout this paper as indicators of votes rather than as
descriptors for the success or failure of presidential policies.

that the economy is shouting for a party change. This does not bode well for the Democratic Party, which continues to endorse
the current status quo.
And to confirm GDP growth’s implications, we also have the disappointing measure of employment to adult population. Again,
there is every reason on Earth to change parties now. There literally has been no Obama recovery, and Hillary Clinton
promises she’ll do more of the same. The U.S. has about 10 million fewer jobs per year than we would have had if the ratio
of employment to adult population were what it was in mid-2000.
Just compare the ascent of the employment to adult population ratio for the eight years of Obama to the Johnson years, or
even to the Nixon years, and especially to the Reagan and Clinton years. This Obama economy really isn’t a recovery, let
alone a strong recovery, as one would expect should have happened following the devastating collapse of the Great
Recession. Why would Hillary Clinton want to run on the Obama record? It’s beyond me.

Using detrended real GDP per adult and total employment per adult, there have been two elections since Truman was elected
in 1948 that appear to contradict my economic improvement hypothesis—the Nixon election in 1968 and the Obama reelection
in 2012. Both of these elections appear to have had very strong extraneous factors at work. For Nixon’s success, the huge
outrage against Johnson’s handling of the Vietnam War could well have overpowered the seemingly good economy and for
Obama in 2012 a high racial sensitivity quotient could also have tipped the scales. If anything, today the war and racial
sensitivity issues operate against the Democrats.
What I beg you to look at carefully are the virtually identical precipitous drops in the economy immediately preceding the
Presidencies of Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama and the totally opposite results during their respective Presidencies. I just
can’t see how a pro-Obama candidate can win in 2016.

Far from being a change agent, once Obama took office, he doubled down on the Bush economic agenda, kept Bush’s key
economic advisors and thereby created further down-drafts for the economy.
The simple fact that absolutely leaps off these charts is the abysmal record attained by the 7+ years of the Obama
Administration. To be fair, the decline began when “W” took office and accelerated greatly when Bush, aided by Geithner and
Bernanke, bailed everyone out and spent huge sums of U.S. resources trying to stimulate the economy—all to no avail. To
me, the circumstances today are almost identical to those of 1980—16 years of bad economics about to be followed by a
political renaissance.
For Hillary Clinton, the Obama record on the economy will be her biggest negative come November. And the very fact that
she actually sought out and embraces this legacy speaks volumes about her judgement.
III. All Elections are Referenda on Incumbents
The Mood of the Country – The History of the Gallup Poll
Whether fair or not, Hillary Clinton is viewed as a Democratic insider and establishment regular. As such, she benefits greatly
in her ability to raise money and attract superdelegate support. But, there’s also a downside to being a Democratic insider
and establishment regular today. When the electorate is unhappy with the direction the country is heading, she’ll also be
blamed right along with the President and other members of his party. This is exactly what happened to the Presidencies of
Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Bush Sr., Bush “W” and presumptively Obama.
If any one of you remembers the contested Democratic primary of 1980 when Senator Ted Kennedy challenged his party’s
sitting President, you will be reminded of the current Democratic primary where Bernie Sanders continues to humiliate Hillary
Clinton, primary after primary. While Senator Kennedy lost in his quest to secure the Democratic nomination, he clearly
exposed all the weaknesses of President Carter, just as Senator Bernie Sanders is exposing Hilary Clinton’s vulnerability.
This can’t be good news for Mrs. Clinton.
For quite some time now, I have been using the Gallup poll question, “Are you satisfied with the way things are going?” as my
measure of the electorate’s level of discontent. This question has been posed by Gallup for years and years and, thus, the

electorate’s response to this question reflects a consistent indicator over a long period of time: in fact, long enough for us to
get a sense of whether this measure is a reliable guide to help forecast election results (see Figure 4). It is:
In my paper “Senate Outlook” of October 2, 2014, I relied heavily on this Gallup question to arrive at my outlandish forecast of
a seven seat gain for the Republicans in that year’s Senate races. My forecast of a seven seat pickup was probably the most
optimistic forecast at the time for the Republicans. But, as it turned out, I was off by two! The Republicans actually picked up
nine seats—West Virginia, Montana, South Dakota, Arkansas, Alaska, Louisiana, Iowa, North Carolina and Colorado—and
lost none.

The predictive power of this Gallup poll’s “are you better off?” question since the election of 1980 is pretty impressive. Both of
Reagan elections were right in sync with Gallup’s poll survey at November of 1980 and November of 1984. Likewise, Bush
Senior’s election in November of 1988 was seen as Reagan’s third term and was foreseen by the Gallup poll question.
And then both Clinton elections were right in line with the survey results from the Gallup poll questions in November of 1992
and November of 1996.
Bush the younger’s election in 2000 is anomalous, but his reelection in 2004 is consistent with the measure as was McCain’s
(really it was Bush’s) defeat in November 2008. The 2012 election also appears contrary to the survey response to the poll
question. If this poll reestablishes its predictive power in 2016, Trump wins in a Reagan-like landslide.
IV. Primary Colors
While perhaps subtle, what happens in contested presidential primaries is also a harbinger of general elections. And if the
current Democratic and Republican primaries are accurate measures of voter enthusiasm, the Democrats are facing a tough
up-hill fight against Republicans to say the least.
Using only states with party primaries, i.e. not state caucuses, and only party primaries up to the time when Donald Trump
became the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, which was following the May 3 rd Indiana primary, there has been
a large increase in voter turnout for the Republicans in 2016 when compared to either 2008 or 2012. In fact, in the 28 state
primaries through May 3 rd , the total number of Republicans who actually voted in those primaries has increased by 57.2% over
2008 and 67.1% over 2012 (see Table 1 on page 8). And, using unweighted state numbers, the 2016 Republican primary
6
Laffer Associates Game On [Updated 7/6/2016]
voter turnout is up 66.6% over 2008 and 103.0% over 2012. I use both total turnout as well as equal weighted state turnout
because our Electoral College system for selecting a president is a combination of both. These numbers are astounding and
by themselves speak volumes for Republican prospects in 2016. And it is not just the Trump phenomenon; it’s the Trump
phenomenon plus much more.
But, the situation is worse for Democrats. When juxtaposed to the Democratic turnout in 2008 and 2016, the 2016 Republican
turnout looks even stronger. Remember, the 2012 Democratic primary was a non-event because President Obama, then a
sitting President, was running for nomination essentially uncontested. We therefore focus exclusively on the change from the
2008 to the 2016 Democratic Party turnout, which, using the same states, is down in total by 20.1%. And, using equal-weighted
state numbers, it’s down by 16.2%. On a state-by-state comparison, Republican turnout is way up, and Democratic turnout is
way down. Someone should ring the Democratic alarm bell.
And, even head-to-head comparisons of absolute voter turnout between the Democratic and Republican primaries in 2016
and 2008 give the Republicans a definite edge for the elections of 2016 and an enormous increase over 2008. So far in 2016,
there have been 3.5 million more Republicans voting in their party’s primaries than there have been Democrats. In 2008, the
Democrats had over 11.3 million additional primary voter advantage over their Republican counterparts. This enormous
increase in Republican voter turnout over Democrats in 2016 plus the fact that there are more Republican voters in 2016 than
Democratic voters should be perhaps the single most disturbing statistic if you are a Hillary supporter, especially given the
exceptional enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders in what has turned out to be a down primary turnout for Democrats.
Even on a state-by-state basis, the flip from Democrat to Republican has been pronounced. So far in this 2016 primary season,
there are 14 new states that had Republican turnout in excess of Democratic turnout, i.e. those states in 2008 had more
Democratic turnout than Republican turnout, while in 2016 Republican turnout exceeds Democratic turnout. These states are
not, as Bernie Sanders would say, “chopped liver.” They include Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New
Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin. When it comes to
the electoral college, flipping a state is far more important than is increasing the margin of victory.
What should be even more alarming to the Democrats than the party flip against Democrats in the 14 states that have already
had primaries is the fact that so far in every state, save Michigan, Democratic voter advantage over Republican’s has declined.
And Michigan, without trying to reach too far for excuses, appears to hinge on the tragedy of the Flint water contamination and
Mitt Romney’s candidacy in 2008 and 2012. And so as not to take everything away from the unique Michigan phenomenon,
it still must be remembered that in both 2008 and 2016, Republican primary turnout in Michigan was greater than Democratic
turnout.

While caucus numbers are influenced by a number of factors other than voter turnout and electorate preferences, their
implications are little different from those of the primary states.
Again these results have to be concerning for Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

V. Politics Bubbles Up from the Bottom and Presidential Selection is the Final Coup de Grace of a Political Revolution
The proposition of this section of this paper is that elections for the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, state
houses, state senates and governorships are accurate indicators of Presidential races. If these federal and state elections are
accurate forecasters in 2016, Hillary Clinton is toast.
a.) Politics in the U.S. Congress
In January 2009, there were 57 Democrats in the U.S. Senate, 2 Independents (Sanders VT and King ME) who always voted
with and caucused with the Democrats, and 41 Republicans. Today, there are 54 Republicans, 44 Democrats plus the same
2 Independents who are effectively Democrats (see Table 5 below).
Likewise, in January 2009, there were 257 Democrats in the U.S. House and 178 Republicans. Today, the tables have turned
and the Republicans have their largest majority in the House since 1928, 247, and the Democrats have 188 House members.
Not only have the numbers changed dramatically, but the ideologies have also become more concentrated. The changes in
the U.S. Congress over the past eight years are huge and reflect an enormous swing in U.S. political sentiments. But the
groundswell doesn’t stop there.

b.) Politics in the States
In the state legislatures, the changes in the Democrat/Republican split have been equally as radical as they are in the U.S.
Congress. Counting all senate members of the various state legislatures in 2009, there were 1,024 Democrats, 889
Republicans and 58 categorized as “other.” (See Table 6 below). But today, the Democrats have only 827 State Senators,
the Republicans 1,088, with 57 categorized as other—this is the very definition of a 180 degree turn around.
In the state houses of representatives in 2009, Democrats had 3,058 members to the Republicans’ tally of 2,334 with 19
“others.” And yet, today, the Republicans control the vast majority of state houses with a grand total of 3,037 house members
to the Democrats’ 2,342 members and 32 “others.” This switch in state legislatures all but assures the Republican control of
redistricting and control of the U.S. House for years to come.
As a final sort of “egg in your beer,” the Democrats had 28 governors to the Republicans’ 22 in 2009. Today there are 31
Republican governors, 18 Democrats and one “other” Bill Walker (I) in Alaska. With solid control of both houses and the
governorships of so many states, a united Republican Party could do almost anything it wants to do if it has the will to do it,
and, at the state level, the party is following through.

While by no means perfect, there is clearly a close correlation between a party’s success in state and local elections, and that
party’s success in the upcoming presidential election. If that close correlation holds in November of 2016, there will be a
Republican landslide.

Laffer Associates Game On [Updated 7/6/2016]
In fact the entire political terrain of the U.S. has shifted 180 degrees in the past 8 years with one exception—the White House.
A betting person with any lick of sense would be loath to bet against a Republican presidency and a radical reversal of
economic policies.
VI. Issues and Political History
Another factor favoring Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton has to do with longevity and negative selection. The political
process, more than any system I’ve ever worked with, thrives on pointing out mistakes and overlooking successes. My advice
to many candidates has been to speak as little as possible and to describe policies in as general a manner as you can get
away with. People aren’t looking through your transcripts to find the next wonderful and positive thing you’ve done, but instead
they try to find your missteps, transgressions, faux pas and failures. Politics is a totally negative process. You live or die by
the sum total of what you’ve done wrong, not on the balance between what you’ve done right and what you’ve done wrong.
In the words of Shakespeare, “the good is oft interred with their bones.” 6
Trump has had very limited exposure as a practicing politician and, therefore, has only his own words and phrases to criticize.
While he may have a number of missteps in business or in his personal life, no one cares. And yet, he truly enjoys celebrity
status as no one in politics today does. Also, given how much Trump has said about any number of issues over the past couple
of years, there are probably quotes that can be used on any side of most any issue. But with Hillary, it’s different.
Hillary has done a lot. She’s been involved in politics at a visible level since the Watergate hearings and maybe even earlier.
Her past contains numerous misdeeds and failures as much because she’s done so much and perhaps not so much because
she has been a failure. Yet, a diligent, hard-driving researcher can find a laundry list of her significant misdeeds.
To wit,
� As events have unfolded, her vote in favor of the Iraq War is a clear sign of poor political judgment, especially in her party.
� Her behavior surrounding the attack on the consulate in Benghazi and the failure to respond to four American deaths sure
looks like a case of poor judgment.
� Her use of a private e-mail server while Secretary of State and thus the potential exposure of critical U.S. intelligence to
those who would do us harm again smacks of poor judgement.
� The Clinton Foundation along with its big gifts and extraordinarily large speaking fees surely creates an aura of impropriety,
favoritism and the absence of sound judgement.
� Her involvement in the cover-up of Fast and Furious is transparent bad judgment.
� Her disregard for coal miners and coal companies in her reckless quest to be seen as a defender of the environment is yet
another case of dangerous judgement.
� The IRS scandal: While not directly implicated as a participant in an administration cover-up of the Cincinnati IRS office
headed by Lois Lerner’s misuse of government power, there are definite indications of her gross negligence in the pursuit
of even-handed fairness of the power to tax.
� As I have predicted, 7 Obamacare has not only driven considerable premium increases for coverage since 2013, when the
marketplace first opened for enrollment, but has also added significant cost burdens onto health insurance companies,
many of whom are choosing to leave the Obamacare marketplace as costs continue to outpace profits. This has led to
entire states, such as Alaska and Alabama, being left with only one insurer on their respective Obamacare marketplaces,
with 650 counties total being left with just one insurer in 2017. 8
� Her personal investments in cattle futures. 9 In the late 1970s, she turned an initial investment of $1,000 into $100,000 in
just 10 months, despite having no previous investment experience. Her close friend, James Blair, an experienced
commodities trader, advised her to enter the commodities market, but Clinton claimed to have made her own investment
decisions. One academic study published in The Journal of Economics and Finance estimated the likelihood of achieving
a result such as Clinton’s as 1 in 31 trillion. 10

random and squeaked when it got caught under the couch.

Technological prediction is particularly chancy, given that technologies progress
by a series of refinements, halted by obstacles and overcome by innovation. Many
obstacles and some innovations can be anticipated, but more cannot. In my own work
with experimentalists on building quantum computers, I typically find that some of the
technological steps I expect to be easy turn out to be impossible, whereas some of the
tasks I imagine to be impossible turn out to be easy. You don’t know until you try.

In the 1950s, partly inspired by conversations with Wiener, John von Neumann
introduced the notion of the “technological singularity.” Technologies tend to improve
exponentially, doubling in power or sensitivity over some interval of time. (For
example, since 1950, computer technologies have been doubling in power roughly
every two years, an observation enshrined as Moore’s Law.) Von Neumann
extrapolated from the observed exponential rate of technological improvement to
predict that “technological progress will become incomprehensively rapid and
complicated,” outstripping human capabilities in the not too distant future. Indeed, if
one extrapolates the growth of raw computing power—expressed in terms of bits and
bit flips—into the future at its current rate, computers should match human brains
sometime in the next two to four decades (depending on how one estimates the
information-processing power of human brains).

The failure of the initial overly optimistic predictions of AI dampened talk about
the technological singularity for a few decades, but since the 2005 publication of Ray
Kurzweil’s The Singularity is Near, the idea of technological advance leading to
superintelligence is back in force. Some believers, Kurzweil included, regard this
singularity as an opportunity: Humans can merge their brains with the
superintelligence and thereby live forever. Others, such as Stephen Hawking and Elon
Musk, worried that this superintelligence would prove to be malign and regarded it as
the greatest existing threat to human civilization. Still others, including some of the
contributors to the present volume, think such talk is overblown.

Wiener’s life work and his failure to predict its consequences are intimately
bound up in the idea of an impending technological singularity. His work on
neuroscience and his initial support of McCulloch and Pitts adumbrated the startlingly
effective deep-learning methods of the present day. Over the past decade, and
particularly in the last five years, such deep-learning techniques have finally exhibited
what Wiener liked to call Gestalt—for example, the ability to recognize that a circle is
a circle even if when slanted sideways it looks like an ellipse. His work on control,
combined with his work on neuromuscular feedback, was significant for the
development of robotics and is the inspiration for neural-based human/machine
interfaces. His lapses in technological prediction, however, suggest that we should
take the notion of a technological singularity with a grain of salt. The general
difficulties of technological prediction and the problems specific to the development of
a superintelligence should warn us against overestimating both the power and the
efficacy of information processing.

The Arguments for Singularity Skepticism
No exponential increase lasts forever. An atomic explosion grows exponentially, but

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024390.txt,"transfer of responsibility for our Islamic Enemy’s hate and resultant actions onto us with our response framed
essentially as an effort to do what we can to try to address the Enemy’s grievance. (Your book, United in Hate,
describes this addiction to hate in detail.

The key to the Inner Jihad is to learn to transfer responsibility for our Islamic Enemy’s hate and resultant
actions back to it and take responsibility back for our own situation. We must learn all we can about the enemy.
We must unwind our inappropriate projections and introjections and rediscover who we are and are not. We
must speak up. We must support those Muslims who promote expressions of Islam that are consistent with our
principles. And we must stalk the C ontrol Factor, constantly be on guard for its intrusion. This is an individual
endeavor as each of our Control Factors uses its own methods. The book gives plenty of examples of each
maneuver discussed but it is important for each of us to discover the unique workings of his own mind. That
takes the work of the Inner Jihad.

FP: Share with our readers what you mean by the “Turnaround Moment.”

Siegel: There is a moment in typical horror films where the central characters have been pushed to their limit.
They then change and fully embrace the willingness to be as ruthless as the threat they face. No more moral
high ground; no more futile attempts to ignore or change the threat’s essence. As Lee Harris described in The
Suicide of Reason, it is the willingness o r license to be (not necessarily actually being) as ruthless that is
critical. It is a mental state that sheds all the prior counter-productive efforts at denial to finally clearly focus on
the threat faced. Part of the Inner Jihad is to reach that Turnaround Moment sooner rather than later.

FP: You suggest that “mirroring” should be used as part of our arsenal. Tell us about it.

Siegel: Mirroring is a literal approach to transferring back to the addict responsibility that we have been
inappropriately accepting. Critical to the addict/enabler relationship is asymmetry. Like the addict, the enemy
uses a less limiting set of rules than we do. The enemy typically initiates aggression while we respond only.
Mirroring means that we demonstrate our willingness to act symmetrically, to be governed by the same rules. It
is stunning how much is accomplished when one’s attitude simply is clear that he will do what is necessary;
often not much else is needed as the addict or enemy realizes the game is fundamentally changed. But other
times action is absolutely needed. Demonstrating that we are not afraid to treat the enemy as it treats us carries
great meaning. Imagine (international law aside) if Israel announced that from now on it will mirror Hamas
such that if civilian populations are targeted by bombs from Gaza, Israel will do the same (it is accused of such
anyway). The population might finally rethink and take responsibility for its privilege of voting its leaders. As
stated earlier, all behavior is instructive and when we mirror we teach the other the effects of his behavior.

Conversely, some situations demand that we assert asymmetry; those cases where it is necessary to highlight
our differences with the enemy. Just this week, an disingenuous report was issued by an NGO drawing an
equivalence between Palestinian and Israe li schoolbooks claiming that both sides have their relativistic “ «
narratives.” Yet, as the Palestinian Media Watch’s website has demonstrated for years, there is nothing in the
West anywhere comparable to the hatred spewed daily by the Palestinian Authority, including through its
education system. It is interesting to note that while the US State Department initially funded the “study,”- in
what appears to be an attempt to sanitize the PA’s record so that the US can continue to fund the PA against the
spirit of US law- Hillary Clinton has a difficult time escaping her conclusion as Senator in 2007 that these
schoolbooks along with other media “profoundly poison(s) the minds of these children.” It is most important
that we do not succumb to this type of use of symmetry that distorts the profound differences between us and
the enemy.

Essentially, we are not clear as a nation, participating in a world with international rules, how to bes t fight this
enemy. The first act of any rehab is to acknowledge that we do not know how nor are we yet competent to

stop our addictions. This is not a book about policy. In fact, the “right” policies are unlikely to emerge until a
critical mass has meaningfully dealt with their Control Factors and share a common perspective. We like to look
at our history and assume a single perspective throughout but the truth is that we had to learn how to respond to
Pearl Harbor, the Nazis, the Cold War etc. The same applies here. Our press promotes “elites” who are tasked
with acting as if they possess the “true wisdom” to deal with our threats but the truth is we do not know nor are

other, and each demands that the other go first. Instead, nobody goes
anywhere.

U.S. officials have very good reason to be wary of Iran's bona fides. In
2009, they reached a deal with Iranian negotiators to send the stockpile of
highly enriched uranium out of the country -- only to see the ayatollah
repudiate it. As Ray Takeyh, an Iran expert with the Council on Foreign
Relations puts it, Khamenei has created a politics where it's hard for him
to compromise. But so has the United States. Anyone who watched
Chuck Hagel's confirmation hearing knows that it is an article of faith in
Congress -- and pretty much a bipartisan one -- that Iran is a faithless,
illegitimate terrorist state that will be deterred from building a bomb only
by the threat of massive attack. Had Hagel been foolish enough to suggest
that the United States offer to reduce sanctions in exchange for Iranian
concessions, the White House would have had to find a new candidate for
defense secretary.

It's the U.S. Congress that arguably holds the high cards, though the White
House put them in its hands. The most potent sanctions are legislated, and
have been written in such a way that they will be very hard to unwind.
Obama can waive them for up to six months. But the ayatollah is not about
to make irreversible decisions in exchange for six months of relief.

The White House is thus stuck between Tehran and Capitol Hill. And it
can't live long with the current stalemate. After all, Obama has said that
containment is not an option. He is hoping that the combination of
economic pain and fear of military action will bring Tehran to its senses. If
it doesn't, the president has said that he is prepared to use force. Perhaps

he feels that just as spurned engagement served as the predicate for tough
sanctions, so would failed negotiations lay the predicate for a broadly
supported strike against Iran's nuclear facilities. Iran left us no choice, he
might say, as the bombers fly.

That would constitute a diplomatic triumph ... if a strike against Iran's
nuclear facilities is a good idea. If in fact it's a dreadful prospect -- worse,
perhaps, even than containment -- then it would constitute a failure that

not just of the state we’d created, but of Jewish civilization, our heritage, our
moral and ethical foundation. As I drove back to Tel Aviv with Avraham and
the others on the morning of fourth day of the war, we heard Israeli ground
forces were consolidating their hold there as well.

After dropping Avraham at the kirya, we drove back to the sayeret base, but
it was nearly empty. The main fighting was now with Syrian armored units on
the Golan Heights, and most of the men in the unit had gone north in the hope
of joining what seemed likely to be the final stage of the war. Although the
precise outcome was not yet clear, there was a dawning certainty, almost
surreal, that

Israel was gaining control of all the areas across our 1948 borders from
which the Arab states around us had shelled Israeli farming settlements, or
facilitated fedayeen attacks and ambushes against our citizens — the very border
areas where I’d led intelligence operations in Sayeret Matkal.

I, too, drove north. Not far from Kibbutz Dan, the staging point for our first
Golan operation, I linked up witha group of other sayeret reservists. Israeli
tanks had already broken the main resistance of the Syrians, but fighting was
continuing in a few parts of the Golan. In the western corner of the Heights
which bordered Lebanon, several villages still lay beyond the Israeli advance.
We got an order to see if we could take them. It took barely an hour, against no
more resistance than I’d met in “capturing” the Egyptians in the Sinai bunker.
By the time we had made our way back across the Golan to the now-abandoned
Syrian headquarters in Quneitra, it was sunset. The war was drawing to a close.

I gave my Jeep to a couple of paratroopers and hot-wired a more comfortable
mode of transport back home: a big, black Mercedes which had obviously
belonged to a senior Syrian officer. If only because of the license plates, I
avoided the main road back into Israel. I found a dirt track running between
Syrian positions on the southern edge of the Golan and descended toward the
fruit groves of Kibbutz Ha’on, near the Sea of Galilee. I then headed for
Givataim in north Tel Aviv, to a place I knew well. It was the home of
Menachem Digli. He had been Avraham Arnan’s deputy in the sayeret when I
left for my stint in officers’ school. Before I returned to the unit, he had a
motorcycle accident, badly damaging his leg. He’d been temporarily reassigned
to a post in intelligence. I figured a Syrian Mercedes would make a nice gift.
Not wanting to wake him, I left it in front of his house. Sadly, he never got to
use it. The next day a couple of military policemen knocked on his door and

BANNON REDUX

annon was back, according to the Bannon faction. According to Bannon himself:
B “Pm good. I’m good. I’m back. I said don’t do it. You don’t fire the director of the
FBI. The geniuses around here thought otherwise.”

Was Bannon back? asked the worried other side of the house—Jared and Ivanka, Dina
Powell, Gary Cohn, Hope Hicks, H. R. McMaster.

If he was back, that meant he had successfully defied the organizational premise of the
Trump White House: the family would always prevail. Steve Bannon had, even in his
internal exile, not stopped his running public verbal assault on Jared and Ivanka. Off the
record became Bannon’s effective on the record. These were bitter, sometimes hilarious,
denunciations of the couple’s acumen, intelligence, and motives: “They think they’re
defending him, but they are always defending themselves.”

Now he declared they were finished as a power center—destroyed. And if not, they
would destroy the president with their terrible and self-serving advice. Even worse than
Jared was Ivanka. “She was a nonevent on the campaign. She became a White House
staffer and that’s when people suddenly realized she’s dumb as a brick. A little marketing
savvy and has a look, but as far as understanding actually how the world works and what
politics is and what it means—nothing. Once you expose that, you lose such credibility.
Jared just kind of flits in and does the Arab stuff.”

The folks on the Jarvanka side seemed more and more genuinely afraid of what might
happen if they crossed the Bannon side. Because the Bannonites, they truly seemed to
fear, were assassins.

On the flight to Riyadh, Dina Powell approached Bannon about a leak involving her to
a right-wing news site. She told him she knew the leak had come from Julia Hahn, one of
Bannon’s people and a former Breitbart writer.

“You should take it up with her,” said an amused Bannon. “But she’s a beast. And she
will come at you. Let me know how it works out.”

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013875.txt,"Becoming a member of the NR is not just about working smarter. It’s about building a system to
replace yourself.

This is the first exercise.

Even if you have no intention of becoming an entrepreneur, this is the ultimate continuation of our
80/20 and elimination process: Preparing someone to replace you (even if it never happens) will produce
an ultrarefined set of rules that will cut remaining fat and redundancy from your schedule. Lingering
unimportant tasks will disappear as soon as someone else is being paid to do them.

But what about the cost?

This is a hurdle that is hard for most. If I can do it better than an assistant, why should I pay them at
all? Because the goal is to free your time to focus on bigger and better things.

This chapter is a low-cost exercise to get you past this lifestyle limiter. It is absolutely necessary that
you realize that you can always do something more cheaply yourself. This doesn’t mean you want to
spend your time doing it. If you spend your time, worth $20—25 per hour, doing something that someone
else will do for $10 per hour, it’s simply a poor use of resources. It is important to take baby steps
toward paying others to do work for you. Few do it, which is another reason so few people have their
ideal lifestyles.

Even if the cost is occasionally more per hour than you currently earn, the trade is often worth it. Let’s
assume you make $50,000 and thus $25 per hour (working from 9-5, Monday through Friday, for 50
weeks per year). If you pay a top-notch assistant $30 per hour and he or she saves you one full 8-hour
shift per week, your cost (subtracting what you’re being paid) is $40 to free an extra day. Would you pay
$40 per week to work Monday to Thursday? I would, and I do. Keep in mind that this is a worst-case
cost scenario.

But what if your boss freaks out?

It’s largely a non-issue, and prevention is better than cure. There is no ethical or legal reason for the
boss to know if you choose non-sensitive tasks. The first option is to assign personal items. Time is time,
and if you’re spending time on chores and errands that could be spent better elsewhere, a VA will
improve life and the management learning curve is similar. Second, you can delegate business tasks that
don’t include financial information or identify your company.

Ready to build an army of assistants? Let’s first look at the dark side of delegation. A review is in
order to prevent abuses of power and wasteful behavior.

Delegation Dangers: Before Getting Started

The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient
operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient
operation will magnify the inefficiency.

— BILL GATES

H... you ever been given illogical assignments, handed unimportant work, or commanded to do

something in the most inefficient fashion possible? Not fun and not productive.

Now it’s your turn to show that you know better. Delegation is to be used as a further step in
reduction, not as an excuse to create more movement and add the unimportant. Remember—unless
something is well-defined and important, no one should do it.

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023399.txt,"In re: TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001., 2012 WL 257568 (2012)

necessary to mount a significant transborder attack. See JA3777-78. In particular, plaintiffs alleged that support during that
crucial period enabled al-Qaeda to expand its footprint, train terrorists, plot and plan acts of terror, and carry out such acts
around the world. JA798-800, 823, 843-44, 3783, 3836, 3871; cf SPA152 (Terrorist Attacks IV) (as the district court
elsewhere acknowledged, “[s]ince its inception in the late 1980’s, al-Qaeda has relied on well-placed financial facilitators and
logistical sponsors to raise, manage and distribute money and resources, enabling it to grow rapidly into a formidable
international terrorist network”).

Imposing ATA liability on defendants who provide this crucial formative support for a terrorist organization is clearly
consistent with Congress’ intent, see supra pp. 66-73, and consistent with the nature of *119 how terrorist groups grow and
become capable of undertaking attacks which, like the September 11 attacks, often take years of planning and development.
See, e.g., 9/11 Commission Final Report p. 48. Thus, as the Seventh Circuit has held en banc, the ATA is predicated on the
assumption that “[t]errorism campaigns often last for many decades .... Seed money for terrorism can sprout acts of violence
long after the investment.” Boim IIT, 549 F.3d at 700. The court went so far as to conclude that, as a general matter, imposing
liability upon “someone who with the requisite state of mind contributed to a terrorist organization in 1995 that killed an
American abroad in 2045 ... would not be as outlandish, given the character of terrorism, as one might think.” Jd. at 699-700.
Here, of course, a much more direct connection of a few years exists between defendants’ acts that supported the
development of what became the world’s most extensive and capable global terrorist organization and that group’s execution
of its most sophisticated and deadly operation.

Lastly, the district court found that “[t]he United States had not even been targeted by al Qaeda” when “defendants provided
[Osama bin Laden] with funding” while “in Sudan during the early 1990’s.” SPA247 (Terrorist Attacks V). This finding is
blatantly incorrect. See supra pp. 28- *120 29. Osama bin Laden had been openly “singl[ing] out the United States for attack”
“since 1992.” 9-11 Commission Final Report, at 48. “Plans to attack the United States were developed with unwavering
single-mindedness throughout the 1990s.” Jd.

II. The District Court Improperly Dismissed The Alien Tort Statute Claims Because The Statute Encompasses Claims
Based On Acts Related To International Terrorism

The district court dismissed the Alien Tort Statute (“ATS”) claims against a handful of defendants because it thought
plaintiffs were required to, but did not, plead “factual allegations [to] support a reasonable inference that the defendant(s]
purposefully aided and abetted, conspired with, or materially supported al Qaeda in the commission of an act of terrorism
involving the hyacking of a commercial airplane.” SPA233 (Terrorist Attacks V). That holding is based on a mistaken
assumption that the ATS authorizes, or plaintiffs alleged, only tort claims based on the hijacking of a commercial airplane in
violation of international law. Neither the ATS nor plaintiffs’ complaints are so limited. Instead, the ATS permits the federal
courts to adjudicate a civil action “by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the laws of nations or a treaty of the
United States.” 28 U.S.C. § 1350. As explained below, the “laws of nations” *121 prohibit acts of international terrorism,
including the provision of material support for terrorism, and is not so narrowly focused on hijacking commercial airplanes.
See infra at Points II.B & C. And, plaintiffs adequately pled facts that readily support a reasonable inference that defendants
knowingly and intentionally provided financing and other forms of material support to al-Qaeda to further its international
terrorism. See supra Points I.B.2 & I.B.3.

The ATS is a jurisdictional statute that Congress enacted as part of the Judiciary Act of 1789 on the “understanding that the
common law would provide a cause of action for the modest number of international law violations with a potential for
personal liability at that time,” namely “violation of safe conducts, infringement of the rights of ambassadors, and piracy.”
Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. 692, 712, 724 (2004). In Sosa, the Supreme Court held that federal courts also may permit
aliens to assert tort claims “based on the present-day law of nations” as long as they “rest on a norm of international character
accepted by the civilized world and defined with a specificity comparable to the features of the 18th-century paradigms.” Jd.
at 724-25. In making this determination, courts should consider “the potential implications for the foreign relations of the
United *122 States” and should be “wary of impinging on the discretion of the Legislative and Executive Branches in
managing foreign affairs.” Jd. at 727.

In cases decided after Sosa, this Court has looked to three factors to determine whether a claim adequately alleges a violation
of customary international law that is cognizable in a tort action under the ATS. To state an ATS claim, the alleged tort must

For example, Helena Stoeckley testified to the jury that she could not remember where she had
been on the night of the murders. MacDonald's attorneys tried to introduce the testimony of six
witnesses - - including a police officer - - to whom she had previously admitted that she was in the
MacDonald house with her friends that night. Since testimony about Stoeckley's prior ad-missions
would technically constitute hearsay - - that is, testimony by one witness about what another
witness had said outside the courtroom - - the judge ruled that the jury could hear about
Stoeckley's hearsay admissions only if [corroborating evidence showed] that they [were]
‘trustworthy.’ 

The judge—who was also unaware of the handwritten lab notes—ruled that there was no
physical evidence that corroborated Stoeckley's admissions; therefore, her admissions were not
trustworthy. Had he been aware of this corroborating evidence, he would have been obligated to
allow the hearsay admissions into evidence.

Thus, the jury never learned that there was hard, scientific evidence of intruders in the house-or
that a woman matching MacDonald's description of one of the intruders had actually admitted to
six different people that she and her friends, not Jeffrey MacDonald, were the killers.

Moreover, in 2005, the former Deputy Marshall, Jim Britt, who was in charge of escorting
Helena Stoeckley to the courtroom came forward and told MacDonald’s lawyer the
following:

Jim Britt avers that he personally witnessed Helena Stoeckley state to James
Blackburn [the prosecutor] that she and others were present in the MacDonald home
on the night of the MacDonald murders and that they had gone there to acquire
drugs; Jim Britt further avers that he witnessed and heard James Blackburn, upon
hearing this, directly threaten Helena Stoeckley, telling her that if she so testified in
court he would indict her for first degree murder. This threat caused her to change
her testimony, as the next day, when called to the witness stand by the defense,
Stoeckley claimed to have amnesia as to her whereabouts from midnight until 5 a.m.
the night of the MacDonald murders -- the precise time-frame during which the
crimes occurred. James Blackburn never disclosed to the court or defense counsel
what Helena Stoeckley admitted to him in Jim Britt's presence. On the contrary,
Blackburn, at a critical juncture in the trial, advised the court that Stoeckley, when he
interviewed her, denied having any knowledge of the MacDonald family, the
MacDonald home, or involvement in the MacDonald murders. Blackburn even went
so far as to elicit from Stoeckley, through leading questions before the jury,
testimony that was contrary to what she had told him during his interview of her the
day before in the presence of Jim Britt.

Finally new DNA and forensic testing has revealed three specimens that did not match any of the
people in the house, as well as unidentified hairs under the fingernails of the victims. This new
and suppressed evidence corroborates Stoeckley’s original account that she remembers being in
the house and participating in the murders. Had the trial judge known about this corroboration,
he would surely have allowed Stoeckley’s earlier statements to be heard by the jury.

York, watching a chess match. It’s no ordinary match. Two men sit

opposite each other. One, a neatly suited figure, stares intently at the
board. You can almost see the heat rising from his head as he processes
the possibilities before him. The other, sits implacably calm and, before
each turn, looks to a screen at the side of the board, reads the instruction,
and makes his move.

This is the famous match between Garry Kasparov and IBM’s Deep
Blue. Kasparov, a child prodigy, became world chess champion at the age
of fifteen and, to this day, holds the record for the highest chess ranking
ever achieved. Some consider him one of the most intelligent people on
the planet. His opponent, Deep Blue, is a massively parallel chess-playing
computer built by IBM’s Watson Research Laboratory. The machine itself
sits a few blocks north of the tournament in an air-conditioned room,
and relays the moves over a phone line to Joe Hoane, the IBM researcher
who moves the pieces.

Six months earlier, in Philadelphia, Kasparov won against Deep Blue.
This is the rematch and has generated a worldwide media frenzy. Tickets
to the event are sold out and most news organizations give a blow-by-
blow report each day. On the eighth day of the tournament Kasparov and
Deep Blue are level pegging. Kasparov is playing an opening he knows
well. It’s one designed to be hard for computers to play and has been
tested extensively against Fritz, a chess computer Grand Masters use for
practice. But Deep Blue doesn’t seem fazed. Kasparov is visibly tired. On
the 16 move he makes a dreadful blunder and sinks into despair. An

VIA FACSIMILE CONFIDENTIAL 
Honorable Mark Filip 
Office of the Deputy Attorney General 
United States Department of Justice 
950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. 
Washington, D.C. 20530 
Dear Judge Filip: 
This letter briefly supplements our prior submission to you dated May 19, 2008. In that 
communication, we urgently requested that your Office conduct an independent review of the 
proposed federal prosecution of our client, Jeffrey Epstein. The dual reasons for our request that 
you review this matter are (i) the bedrock need for integrity in the enforcement of federal 
criminal laws, and (ii) the profound questions raised by the unprecedented extension of federal 
law by the United States Attorney's Office in Miami (the USAO) to a prominent public figure 
who has close ties to former President Clinton. 
The need for review is now all the more exigent. On Monday, May 19, 2008, First 
Assistant Jeffrey Sloman of the USAO responded to an email from Jay Lefkowitz informing U.S. 
Attorney Alex Acosta that we would be seeking your Office's review. Mr. Sloman's letter, 
which imposed a deadline of June 2, 2008 to comply with all the terms of the current Non-
Prosecution Agreement (the Agreement), plus new unilateral modifications, on pain of being 
deemed in breach of that Agreement, appears to have been deliberately designed to deprive us of 
an adequate opportunity to seek your Office's review in this matter. 
The USAO's desire to foreclose a complete review is understandable, given that the 
Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) has already determined that our substantive 
arguments regarding why a federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein is not warranted were 
compelling. However, in contradiction to Mr. Sloman's assertion that CEOS had provided an 
independent, de novo review, CEOS made clear that it did not do so. Indeed, CEOS declined to 
examine several of the more troubling aspects of the investigation of Mr. Epstein, including the 
deliberate leak to the New York Times of numerous highly confidential aspects of the 
investigation and negotiations between the parties as well as the recent crop of civil lawsuits 
filed against Mr. Epstein by Mr. Sloman's former law partner. 
The unnecessary and arbitrarily imposed deadline set by the USAO was done without any 
respect for the normal functioning and scheduling of state judicial matters. It requires that 
Mr. Epstein's counsel persuade the State Attorney of Palm Beach to issue a criminal information 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 019221 
Honorable Mark Filip 
May 27, 2008 
Page 2 
to a charge that the State Attorney has not, despite a two year investigation, determined to be 
appropriate. Mr. Epstein's counsel must also successfully expedite a plea of guilty to this charge 
on a date prior to July 8, 2008, which is the date presently set by the state court Judge. 
Further, the unnecessary deadline is even more problematic because Mr. Epstein's effort 
to reconcile the state charge and sentence with the terms of the Agreement requires an unusual 
and unprecedented threatened application of federal law. Thus, it places Mr. Epstein in the 
highly unusual position of having to demand that the State acquiesce to a more severe 
punishment than it had already determined was appropriate. 
We have attempted to resolve these and other issues through the USA() and CEOS, 
including raising our concerns about the USAO's inappropriate conduct with respect to this 
matter. But those avenues have now been shut down. Mr. Sloman's letter purports to prohibit 
any further contact between Mr. Epstein's defense team and U.S. Attorney Acosta, and instead 
requires us to communicate with the USA() only though Mr. Sloman's subordinates. 
While it pains us to say this, this misguided prosecution from the outset gives the 
appearance that it may have been politically motivated. Mr. Epstein is a highly successful, self-
made businessman and philanthropist who entered the public arena only by virtue of his close 
personal association with former President Bill Clinton. There is little doubt in our minds that 
the USA() never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case if Mr. Epstein were just 
another John. 
U.S. Attorney Acosta previously has stated that he is sympathetic to our federalism-
related concerns, but he has taken the position that his authority is limited by enforcement 
policies set forth in Washington, D.C. As expressed in our prior communication to you, we 
believe that a complete and independent appraisal and resolution of this case most appropriately 
would be undertaken by your Office—beginning with the rescission of the arbitrary, unfair, and 
unprecedented deadline that Mr. Sloman demands to have imposed in this case. At the very 
least, we would appreciate a tolling of the arbitrary timeline imposed on our client by the USA() 
in order to allow time for your office to consider our request that you undertake a review of this 
case. 
Thank you for your time and attention.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020049.txt,"that he was willing to take on the state power. The outsider against the insiders. After all,
that’s why he was elected.

At some level he had a point. One reason presidents don’t fire the director of the FBI is
that they fear the consequences. It’s the Hoover syndrome: any president can be hostage to
what the FBI knows, and a president who treats the FBI with something less than
deference does so at his own peril. But this president had stood up to the feds. One man
against the unaccountable power that the left had long railed against—and that more
recently the right had taken as a Holy Grail issue, too. “Everybody should be rooting for
me,” the president said to friends, more and more plaintively.

Here was another peculiar Trump attribute: an inability to see his actions the way most
others saw them. Or to fully appreciate how people expected him to behave. The notion of
the presidency as an institutional and political concept, with an emphasis on ritual and
propriety and semiotic messaging—statesmanship—was quite beyond him.

Inside the government, the response to Comey’s firing was a kind of bureaucratic
revulsion. Bannon had tried to explain to Trump the essential nature of career government
officials, people whose comfort zone was in their association with hegemonic
organizations and a sense of a higher cause—they were different, very different, from
those who sought individual distinction. Whatever else Comey might be, he was first and
foremost a bureaucrat. Casting him ignominiously out was yet another Trump insult to the
bureaucracy.

Rod Rosenstein, the author of the letter that ostensibly provided the justification for
firing Comey, now stood in the line of fire. The fifty-two-year-old Rosenstein, who, in
rimless glasses, seemed to style himself as a bureaucrat’s bureaucrat, was the longest-
serving U.S. attorney in the country. He lived within the system, all by the book, his
highest goal seeming to be to have people say he did things by the book. He was a straight
shooter—and he wanted everyone to know it.

All this was undermined by Trump—trashed, even. The brow-beating and snarling
president had hectored the country’s two top law enforcement officials into an ill-
considered or, at the very least, an ill-timed indictment of the director of the FBI.
Rosenstein was already feeling used and abused. And then he was shown to have been
tricked, too. He was a dupe.

The president had forced Rosenstein and Sessions to construct a legal rationale, yet
then he could not even maintain the bureaucratic pretense of following it. Having enlisted
Rosenstein and Sessions in his plot, Trump now exposed their efforts to present a
reasonable and aboveboard case as a sham—and, arguably, a plan to obstruct justice. The
president made it perfectly clear that he hadn’t fired the director of the FBI because he did
Hillary wrong; he fired Comey because the FBI was too aggressively investigating him
and his administration.

prepared to call ourselves animals, so should the little creatures which
emerge within the game. We simply emerged in a similar but slightly
more complex game.

This proposal would mean our Universe is entirely deterministic,
our lives the result of a gigantic computer program that we live within
and form part of. Chaos might make it impossible to predict the future
without running the program and watching what happened, but the
results would be inevitable, set in motion at the dawn of time. There is
no place for free will in such a Universe, no place for reason. The world
would simply be.

But a strange idea will come to our aid to show us the limits of
computation and allow us to question whether we live in a predetermined
world. This idea is Aleph 1 - something larger than infinity. And it is
infinity we will explore next.

are two types of bureaucracies: (1) general-purpose bureaucracies, and (2) specialized
bureaucracies. The following institutional profiles include many of the principal bodies

involved in China’s overseas influence activities.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is a typical general-purpose bureaucracy that serves
as China’s main interlocutor with foreign governments. But since most of its time is
consumed by routine diplomatic activities, the Foreign Ministry itself does not play a
significant role in influence operations overseas. The one area where it does is via its
Department of Public Diplomacy (1h3e#82334943e 51), which primarily oversees the MFA
Spokesman’s Office in Beijing, international media outreach, and China’s embassy
spokesmen abroad; international visitor programs; and “exchange” organizations, such
as the Chinese People’s Institute of Foreign Affairs (which bring a range of former
officials and international affairs experts to China). Also, the MFA is important
insofar as Chinese embassies abroad have representatives of the Ministry of Culture,
the Xinhua News Agency, the CCP International Liaison Department, the Ministry
of Education, and other bureaucratic bodies, each of which are involved in foreign

influence activities.

United Front Work Department

The CCP United Front Work Department is a specialized CCP organization, one of
four Central Committee departments. Its principal mission is to build support for
the CCP and its policies among domestic ethnic groups, religious groups, the eight
so-called democratic parties (R= tit), the Chinese diaspora worldwide, and political,
economic, and social elites in Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. These United Front
activities have a long history dating to the CCP’s pre-1949 rise to power. The main
tasks and objectives of the CCP’s United Front activities outside of Greater China are
laid out in Article 31 of the CCP Guidelines on United Front Work (PHRF RAKE
IF Kb) issued in 2015—they target almost exclusively the Chinese diaspora, who
are supposed to be encouraged to “contribute to the modernization and reunification
of the motherland, advance the cause of opposing (Taiwanese) independence and
promoting reunification, inherit and propagate China’s outstanding culture, and
promote the friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of the other

countries in the world.”

Subject: Financials: buy XLF call spreads

Underweight positioning, buybacks resuming, positive momentum and strong fundamentals all indicate that there is
still further upside potential in financials (more details below). Our financials sector specialist thinks XLF could have
another 20-25% upside given the many levers to the Trump Trade: less regulation, higher interest rates, higher vol,
economic growth, loan growth, etc. The asset sensitive regional banks are more of a pure play on a rates move but we
view the larger cap banks as having multi-pronged upside given the aforementioned points.

That said, given the velocity and magnitude of the recent move and uncertainty around the impact and timing of
Trump’s policies, we believe options offer better risk-reward than being outright long financials stocks here. With flat
call skew, “appearing” call spreads with upside knock-ins price well.

Buy a 1 year XLF call spread for 2.6% premium

e Buyaii0% call

e = Sell a 117.5% call with an at-expiry knock-in at 125% (call is not active unless XLF is 125% or higher at expiry)
o Total premium is 2.6%

o Gross max payoff if knock-in is triggered: 2.9x (7.5%/2.6%)

o Gross max payoff if knock-in is not triggered: 5.7x (14.9%/2.6%) — you have upside up to 124.9%

Post Election Flow Skews - Buyers of Health Care (via ETFs) and Financials (mainly ETFs)
e US Buyback Flows

e Cons Disc, Technology and Financials are the largest 3 sectors for US buybacks (over 70% of execution). We
are seeing a seasonal increase in buybacks as we come out of the low seasonal month of the year (October) and should
see increased buyback executions until year-end, another source of upside for the Cons Disc, Technology and Financials
sectors.

Global Positioning, Nigel Tupper, 11/14. Large long-only funds are more underweight Financials than any other
sector and are UW this sector in all regions.

Future of Financials conference hosted 90 public and private companies at our Future of Financials conference. We are
raising our price objectives across most of our names. Three primary reasons why we think there is upside remaining
after the recent rally: 1) an improved outlook on both activity levels and interest rates, driving revenue upside; 2)
potentially lower regulatory burden, particularly as new supervisory leadership can come with the new administration;
and 3) relatively lighter positioning in US financials vs. other sectors. (Erika Najarian)

(12) The globalization of the world economy may have affected the distribution of wage rates at home. The U.S. has
seen international trade and immigration increase in the past few decades, as well as an increase in the consumption of
imported goods. Theoretically, an increase in imported goods, at the expense of domestic goods produced by
lower-skilled workers, could hold down wages of domestic workers, though research on the subject has been
inconclusive. An increase in the supply of foreign-born workers could also put pressure on wages in those jobs. But,
here as well, the effects of foreign workers on wage rates have been modest. Indeed, research note that immigrant
workers largely complement, rather than substitute, native-born workers, and thus have little impact on wages, while

actually increasing overall growth.

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022380.txt,"Administration and
agenda

Looking ahead to the Trump administration and a
Republican-controlled Congress, the focus will be on
Trump’s top priorities: infrastructure, tax reform,
dismantling the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and
immigration reform. President-elect Trump highlighted
his commitment to infrastructure investment during his
victory speech early November 9. “Weare going to fix our
inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels,
airports, schools, hospitals,” he said. “We’re going to
rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way,
second to none. And we will put millions of our people to
work as we rebuild it.” Trump would fund infrastructure
investment through public-private partnerships and
private investments through tax incentivesrather than
tax reform, though he has called for early action on that
issue as well. On October 22, Trump outlined a voter
contract for hisfirst 100 days plan that calls for
enactment of:

» The Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act
(comprehensive tax reform);

» The End the Offshoring Act, to establish tariffsto
discourage companies from laying off their workers in
order to relocatein other countries and ship their
products back to the U.S. tax-free;

» TheAmerican Energy & Infrastructure Act, to leverage
public-private partnerships and private investments
through tax incentivesto raise $1 trillionin
infrastructure investment over 10 years;

» The School Choice And Education Opportunity Act, to
expand primary education options and make college
more affordable;

» The Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act, to repeal the
ACA and replace it with Health Savings Accounts;

» The Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act, to allow
Americansto deduct childcare and elder care;

» The End Illegal Immigration Act, to fund the
construction of a wall on the Mexican border;

» The Restoring Community Safety Act, to reduce crime;

» The Restoring National Security Act, to rebuild the
military by eliminating the defense sequester and
expanding military investment; and

» The Clean up Corruption in Washington Act, to enact
“new ethics reforms to Drain the Swamp and reduce
the corrupting influence of special interests on our
politics.”

As part of the voter contract announced in October,
Trump has also pledged to act on his first day in office to
“cancel every unconstitutional executive action,
memorandum and order issued by President Obama.”
Trump advisor Anthony Scaramucci said in October that
the new administration would repeal the rulemaking on
conflicts of interest in the delivery of investment advice to
IRA and 401(k) plan investors.

Regulationsthat have been finalized cannot be
unilaterally vacated by executive order without
intervening regulatory or legislative action. In order to
make changes to final regulations without legislative
action, agencies are typically required to follow the
administrative procedural process which requires a notice
and comment process prior to modifying regulations. If
an Administration wishes to repeal or revise a final
regulation through the administrative process, the agency
may be required to demonstrate that its actions are not
“arbitrary and capricious,” and based on morethana
change in political views. It is possible that a new
Administration could dispense with the notice and
comment process by moving to issue an interim final rule,
replacing the previousregulation. In this situation, the
agency could be called on demonstrate that it acted with
“good cause” to circumvent the typical notice and
comment requirements.

A new Administration could also use its executive power
to affect the level of legal defense of challengesto
existing regulations provided by the Administration or
temporarily refuse to exercise its enforcement
responsibilities until compelled through legal action or
public pressure.

Trump also intends to immediately begin the process of
filling the Supreme Court vacancy created by the death of
Antonin Scalia in early 2016 —one that could spark
fireworkson Capitol Hilland acrossthe country’s highly
charged political environment. How Republicans,
Democrats, and Trump navigate through the process of
nominating and confirming a Justice to the Supreme
Court is likely to set the tone in the Senate for the next
two years.

Trump also intends to act on trade issueson his first day

in office, including:

» announcing his intention to renegotiate or withdraw
from NAFTA;

» announcing withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific
Partnership; and

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011558.txt,"Tension began building in the north in the spring of 1967, initially set off by
Syrian efforts to divert water from the upper reaches of the Jordan River, an
important water source for Israel was well. In a series of exchanges, Syrian
troops on the Golan fired on Israeli tractors in the demilitarized zone below, and
began shelling our argicultural settlements in the Galilee, while we responded
with tank fire and then air power, scrambling our jets and shooting down six
Syrian MiG-21s.

The first indication that we might be headed toward war came as I returned
to university for the spring term, and trouble began brewing in the south. Ben-
Gurion had by now retired as prime minister. His successor was the undeniably
thoughtful, if far less charismatic, Levi Eshkol. During Israel’s Independence
Day parade on May 15, he received word that Egypt had moved thousands of
troops into the Sinai, nearer to the border with Israel. Then, with the Soviets
warned Nasser of what they said were Israeli plans for a preemptive strike
against Syria, he went further expelling the United Nations force put in place
after the 1956 war. On May 23, he closed the Straits of Tiran, Israel’s trading
gateway to the Red Sea and the source of virtually all our oil imports.

I was told to report to Sayeret Matkal the following day, as part of the first
group of reservists called up. When I reached the base, Uzi Yairi, who was now
in charge of the unit, organized us into four teams. He put me in command of
one of them. We were told to prepare ourselves to helicopter into the Sinai,
attack a series of Egyptian air bases and put the runways out of commission. My
team’s target was the base at Gebel Libni, not far from where I’d placed, and
recently failed to defuse, our first intelligence intercept.

With each passing day, war looked more likely, and there was no confidence
we would win without a costly struggle. In 1948, Arab attacks had killed about
170 people in Tel Aviv. Now, word got out that a park in the center of the city
had been set aside to allow for the burial of as many as 5,000. With Israel’s
military commanders pressing Eshkol to take the initiative and launch a
preemptive strike, he delivered a radio address at the end of May, intended to
reassure the country the situation was under control. But due to last-minute,
handwritten changes to his typescript, he faltered while reading it. He sounded

During the four previous years of Hensarling’s
chairmanship, most of the committee’s major bills died
quietly in the Senate, such as efforts to repeal much of
Dodd-Frank (the CHOICE Act), impose substantial reforms
upon the Fed, restructure the CFPB and strip the FSOC of
various powers. That may change now that the House,
Senate and White House will operate with greater
coordination, though the threat of the Senate filibuster
limits what Republicans can achieve. Hensarling notably
has enjoyed a longtime friendship with Vice President-
elect Mike Pence, which will give him a powerful ally in the
White House as the new administration plots its strategy
for financial regulation and nominates key appointees for
the regulatory agencies. Hensarling agrees with Senators
Crapo and Brown on the importance of capital for big
banks, but he wantsto reward banks with relief from
much of Dodd-Frank’s supervisory regime if they agree to
a higher leverage ratio. Hensarling can be expected to
reintroduce his CHOICE Act and Rep. Bill Huizenga’s (R-
Ml) package of Fed reforms (the FORM Act), and to renew
the panel’s aggressive oversight of the CFPB, the FSOC
and other bodies established by Dodd-Frank. Republicans
have also been critical of moves by global regulatory
bodies to set capital and liquidity rules for “systemically
important” banks and insurance companies.

Wells Fargo Scandal. Lawmakersin both the House and
Senate are certain to resume their investigations of Wells
Fargo in the wake of revelationsthat the bank’s
employees created as many as 2 million accounts without
customers’ consent. Hensarling and other Republicans
want to use the scandal to raise questions about the
performance of the CFPB and the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), while Ranking
Member Waters has vowed to offer a bill breaking up
Wells Fargo into smaller companies. On the Senate side,
Ranking Member Brown has used the scandal to focus on
mandatory arbitration provisions in financial contracts,
and will likely propose legislation prohibiting such clauses,
though Sen. Crapo is unlikely to support him. In an
editorial piece in October, Camden Fine, president of the
Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA),
wrote that he “fully expected” that Wells Fargo’s new
policy of notifying customers whenever a new account is
created in their name, along with “far more stringent
policies, will ultimately become mandatory as
policymakersrespond to the scandal with additional
regulatory burdens on banks of all sizes.”

Oversight of Regulators. As they have in previous years,
the banking committees in 2017 will devote considerable
time to overseeing rules issued by financial regulators.
These will include the still-unfinished interagency rules for
clawing back incentive compensation drafted by the SEC,
the Fed, the FDIC and other agencies; the CFPB’s
controversial new rules for prepaid cards, payday lenders
and mandatory arbitration clauses; the global Financial
Stability Board’s forthcoming regulations for capital held
by large insurers; and the international Basel Committee’s
rules for bank capital, which are expected to be issued by
the end of this year. The Banking Committee must also
schedule hearings for high-level Treasury nominees, as
well as nomineesfor key vacancies at the SEC, CFTC, the
Federal Reserve and the Ex-Ilm Bank, which were never
filled in the current Congress because of lingering
disputes with the Obama administration.

Two Deadlines to Watch: 1)thelargest banks resubmit
their “living will’ resolution plans in May 2017, alwaysa
source of contention for critics of “too big to fail’; 2) the
Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) expires at the end of
2017, forcing yet another ideological dispute over
whether the federal backstop program should be
renewed.

Mr. Epstein. Instead, she said, they were told that Mr. Krischer would convene a
grand jury to examine the evidence and decide what charges, if any, to bring.

Around that time, the police report said, Mr. Dershowitz met with prosecutors
to share information about the accusers, including statements they had posted on
MySpace.com, the social networking site, concerning use of drugs and alcohol.
According to the report, Mr. Krischer’s office then decided to delay the grand jury

session for several months.

The Palm Beach police grew frustrated, the report said, and on May 1 the
department asked prosecutors to approve warrants to arrest Mr. Epstein.

Chief Reiter also wrote Mr. Krischer questioning “the unusual course that your
office’s handling of this matter has taken” and suggesting that Mr. Krischer
disqualify himself. Chief Reiter refused several requests to be interviewed, and his
spokeswoman would not say explicitly why he had urged the prosecutor to step
aside.

Mike Edmondson, a spokesman for Mr. Krischer, said the state attorney’s office
sometimes sent noncapital cases to grand juries when there were questions about
witness credibility. Mr. Krischer does not recommend a particular charge in such
cases, Mr. Edmondson said, but gives the grand jury a list of possible charges.

Bruce J. Winick, a law professor at the University of Miami, said that while
prosecutors in Florida rarely referred noncapital cases to grand juries, they

sometimes did so with sensitive cases to be extra-cautious.

Mr. Lefcourt said the police were wrong to have released the report so soon,
especially without correcting information that later proved wrong. He cited his
assertion that one accuser had lied about her age, adding that she had also been
arrested on drug charges and had been fired by her employer for stealing.

“What I’m trying to focus on,” Mr. Lefcourt said, “is, What’s motivating the
selective and misleading release of information to the public?”

Exchanges

The Chinese government organizes and pays for exchanges in which participants travel
from the United States, divulge technical knowledge through scripted venues, are briefed
on China’s technology interests, return to their US base to collect more information, and
repeat the process. China has a program for what it euphemistically calls “short-term visits”
by co-opted foreigners, which, stripped of its rhetoric, is indistinguishable from state-run
espionage.

Cooperation organizations and advocacy groups

Many Sino-US S&T “cooperation” organizations in the United States facilitate these transfers
and have individual memberships of hundreds to thousands. The figure scales to some
ninety such groups worldwide. Members usually are expatriate Chinese, although China is
expanding its recruitment of nonethnic Chinese. One significant example of a Sino-US S&T
cooperation organization is Triway Enterprise, Inc. (=ZEI®ABRAS Al), an “external training
institute” set up under the auspices of the State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs

in Falls Church, Virginia, with branches in Beijing and Nanjing. According to the Chinese
version of the website, the company “since 1993 has been putting its energy into promoting
bilateral exchange and cooperation between China and the US in the fields of S&T, culture,
education and management with great success.”§

China S&T advocacy groups in the United States declare loyalty to China and acknowledge
a “duty” to support China’s development. Members visit China to lecture, guide Chinese
technical projects, transfer technologies, receive shopping lists from Chinese entities, and
engage in other kinds of “technical exchanges.” Many of them sit on Chinese government
boards that decide the future of China’s national technology investment. Another
example of a China S&T advocacy group is the Silicon Valley Chinese Engineers Association
(EAE LEI), which describes itself as “a non-profit professional organization formed
mainly by the professionals in the Bay Area from mainland China with a mission to
promote professionalism and entrepreneurship among members,” which is achieved by
“organizing a variety of professional activities and establishing channels to allow members to
engage in China’s rapid economic development” [emphasis added].?

Chinese government tech transfer offices, facilitation companies, and career transfer
personnel, some of whom are posted to China’s diplomatic offices, support and direct
the US-based groups. In China, hundreds of government offices are devoted entirely to
facilitating foreign transfers of technology “by diverse means.”

which will help make sense out of this rapidly emerging field.

I asked the essayists to consider:

(a) The Zen-like poem “Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird,” by Wallace
Stevens, which he insisted was “not meant to be a collection of epigrams or of ideas, but
of sensations.” It is an exercise in “perspectivism,” consisting of short, separate sections,
each of which mentions blackbirds in some way. The poem is about his own imagination;
it concerns what he attends to.

(b) The parable of the blind men and an elephant. Like the elephant, AI is too big
a topic for any one perspective, never mind the fact that no two people seem to see things
the same way.

What do we want the book to do? Stewart Brand has noted that “revisiting
pioneer thinking is perpetually useful. And it gives a long perspective that invites
thinking in decades and centuries about the subject. All contemporary discussion, is
bound to age badly and immediately without the longer perspective.”

Danny Hillis wants people in AI to realize how they’ ve been programmed by
Wiener’s book. “You’re executing its road map,” he says, and you just don’t realize it.”

Dan Dennett would like to “let Wiener emerge as the ghost at the banquet. Think
of it as a source of hybrid vigor, a source of unsettling ideas to shake up the established
mindset.”

Neil Gershenfeld argues that “stealth remedial education for the people running
the “Big Five” would be a great output from the book.”

Freeman Dyson Freeman, one of the few people alive who knew Wiener, notes
that “Zhe Human Use of Human Beings is one of the best books ever written. Wiener got
almost everything right. I will be interested to see what your bunch of wizards will do
with it.”

The Evolving AI Narrative

Things have changed—and they remain the same. Now AI is everywhere. We have the
Internet. We have our smartphones. The founders of the dominant companies—the
companies that hold “the whip that lashes us’—have net worths of $65 billion, $90
billion, $130 billion. High-profile individuals such as Elon Musk, Nick Bostrom, Martin
Rees, Eliezer Yudkowsky, and the late Stephen Hawking have issued dire warnings about
AI, resulting in the ascendancy of well-funded institutes tasked with promoting “Nice
AI.” But will we, as a species, be able to control a fully realized, unsupervised, self-
improving AI? Wiener’s warnings and admonitions in Zhe Human Use of Human Beings
are now very real, and they need to be looked at anew by researchers at the forefront of
the AI revolution. Here is Dyson again:

Wiener became increasingly disenchanted with the “gadget worshipers” whose
corporate selfishness brought “motives to automatization that go beyond a
legitimate curiosity and are sinful in themselves.” He knew the danger was not
machines becoming more like humans but humans being treated like machines.
“The world of the future will be an ever more demanding struggle against the
limitations of our intelligence,” he warned in God & Golem, Inc., published in

He said a deal to purchase the Miami Marlins baseball team that he was involved in earlier this year was an example of the sort of investment
the firm’s clients might be interested in.

A private-equity fund managed by Viking will own the majority of the business, while Fleming and others in management will invest, he said.

A trust representing the broader Rockefeller family will remain an owner, though it’s selling some of its stake as part of the transaction.

Rockefeller & Co., which began 135 years ago as the family office of oil baron John D. Rockefeller, oversees about $10.9 billion for families and
other institutional investors, and advises on another $5.3 billion, according to the statement. Fleming said that Viking’s capital will be used to

expand these businesses, as well as building an advisory arm.

“The industry is very fragmented, Fleming said. For independent companies that combine wealth and asset management, as well as advisory,

“there’s room, if you do it well, to really generate some market share, especially for a firm with a brand as good as Rockefeller, he added.

Viking Global, which was founded by Andreas Halvorsen, has about $25 billion under management, making it one of the biggest hedge funds in
the world.

The Rockefeller family office was advised by Ardea Partners, an investment bank formed last year by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. veteran Chris
Cole and a handful of former colleagues. Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP provided legal advice, according to the statement. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind,
Wharton & Garrison LLP was legal adviser to Viking Global.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Fleming’s new role earlier Wednesday.

thwart a great number of terrorism acts by intercepting
communication signals from one terrorist to another.
That same dynamic, a form of signal intelligence, of
finding a terrorist in Europe, can be used to intercept
communication between cancer sells. Cancer cells
merely communicate in protean code rather than
electronic code. If you can decode what the signals are
saying you can jam those signal between terrorist

you can decode biological signals you can jam them too,

you aS a practice to drop the footnote; was it in
connection with this case or some other circumstance?

A. It was -- as I recall, it was several years
earlier. I don't know. Maybe a year or two earlier
than this particular litigation, from what I remember.
If I looked at some of my other pro bono cases around
the country, we might be able to get a sharper time
frame on that. I've done pro bono crime victims in a
lot of cases. And the dean just thought it might be
useful to have that kind of a footnote to avoid any

But there is a second way of counting. Take your apples and put each
next to an orange. If they match up, you can easily see they are equal in
number. “Look,” I say, “I have the same number of apples as oranges.” This
method is more primitive and does not require the concept of numbers,
but it is very useful. If ’m a shepherd I can hold a set of counters in a bag,
one for each sheep. To ensure all my flock are gathered in for the night I
drop one counter into the bag as each sheep enters the enclosure. I don't
need to give the counters number names.

The Munduruku tribe, from the Amazon rainforest, have no concept
of number names beyond five. Their counting system simply goes one,
two, three, four, five, many. Yet this second way of counting allows them
to function successfully, deciding whether two groups of things have
the same number of elements, even if there are more than five of them.
For example, if they need to determine if they have enough spears for a
hunt, each person simply stands next to their spear. If everyone has one,
they're ready. If not, then the empty handed Munduruku simply make
one. No need for pesky numbers or mathematics lessons.

This second way of counting is particularly useful when tackling
infinity because we are not sure what infinity is. Treating it the same way
the Munduruku treat the number ‘many’ is the safest thing to do. The
first question we would like to answer is whether all infinite things are
the same.

This behavior was called “sensitivity to initial conditions” by David Ruelle (1978;
Ruelle and Takens, 19771). It is noteworthy, however, that over a range of values of
the parameters, the overall pattern of the orbits of the Lorenz attractor results in
characteristic geometric pictures as well as invariant statistical descriptors.
Qualitative and quantitative global similarities were gained while specific solutions
were lost in these “strange attractors” of nonlinear systems. Analog computer
simulation of a simpler set of equations inspired by nonlinear chemical reaction
kinetics led to the discovery by Rdéssler (1976) of another early and generic strange
attractor combining sensitivity to initial conditions and characteristic geometries and

measures.

and V.I. Arnold (Arnold and Avez, 1968), the French mathematicians, Rene Thom
(1972) and David Ruelle (1978) and the U.C. Berkeley mathematicians, Steve
Smale (1967) and his student, Rufus Bowen (1975), and their associates who
gathered together these and other related computational discoveries and embedded
them in a qualitative theory of nonlinear differential equations, using a variety of
formalisms, including point set and differential topology, geometry, analysis and
ergodic (having an invariant statistical description) measure theory that formally
established the fundamentals for research in nonlinear dynamical systems. Here a
dynamical system refers generally and simply to the components and nonlinear
processes (transformations) that move points (values) in discrete (“map”) or
continuous (“differential equation”) time around in an appropriately defined space.
The phrase, “nonlinear transformation” in this context does not imply easily solvable
curved functions, such as those representing the sigmoid kinetic or threshold
functions of enzymes and neuronal networks or those that smoothly log transform
the amplitudes of auditory or other sensory modalities in man, but rather allude to

expressions containing products, powers and functions of the computational and/or

experimental variables x,, such as x,x,, (x,)° Orsin(x) .

As for “outsourcing” your banking, any company that needs to take checks (cheques) should consider
a lock box solution. Just about any bank that does business banking offers it. All checks go to a PO box
at the bank, the bank processes the checks and deposits them, and according to your instructions can
send you a file of all the checks that are deposited. Normally this can be done in either a flat, Excel or
other file type that can interface with any accounting systems from Excel, to Quicken to SAP. Quite cost

to Terminal E. It is a nine-minute walk through the transit passage-
way. Snowden, though, had one good reason for not going to Ecua-
dor, even if Russia had permitted it. He believed that he would be
vulnerable to rendition by the U.S. government in Ecuador. “If they
[the U.S. government] really wanted to capture me, they would’ve
allowed me to travel to Latin America, because the CIA can oper-
ate with impunity down there,” he explained in the previously cited
interview with Katrina vanden Heuvel, the editor of The Nation, in
2014. He had already discussed the likelihood of his being captured
in Ecuador with Assange before his departure for Moscow. He later
told Alan Rusbridger, the editor of The Guardian, that he considered
himself at risk in Latin America. So why would Snowden, who told
Greenwald that his “first priority” was his own “physical safety,”
leave the comparative safety of Russia to put himself in jeopardy in
Ecuador?

He had not obtained a visa to Ecuador at its consulate in Hong
Kong, as Kucherena confirmed. The Ecuador destination was, as we
have seen, a cover story put out by Assange and his associates, and it

© worked with the press. ®

Over a hundred reporters and photographers scrambled aboard
Aeroflot Flight SU150 to Cuba the next morning in response to this
anonymous tip on a website, but Snowden was not aboard that flight
and was not seen in Terminal E. By the time the plane landed in
Cuba, Aeroflot denied that anyone named Snowden had ever been
booked on any of its flights to Cuba, a denial it continued to repeat to
every reporter who queried the airline for the next six weeks.

The first news that Snowden was still in Russia came on July 1,
2013. A statement posted on the WikiLeaks website—and signed
“Edward Snowden”—after thanking “friends new and old” for his
“continued liberty,” accused President Obama of pressuring “leaders
of nations from which I have requested protection to deny my asy-
lum petitions.” It added, “This kind of deception from a world leader
is not justice, and neither is the extralegal penalty of exile. These are
the old, bad tools of political aggression.” In fact, Snowden had not
suffered a “penalty of exile,” because his passport was still valid for
returning to the United States, but that was not an option for him as
the statement made clear.

dispute as to which of the two meanings should be used, as there are clearly
differing meanings. While OLC’s reading may be a permissible one, so is a
pro-victim reading.

OLC also tums to the CVRA’s legislative history to bolster its
conclusion. But, here again, its analysis is misleading. OLC relies on a
passage from Senate floor colloquy between Senators Jon Kyl and Dianne
Feinstein regarding the CVRA’s scope. In OLC’s recounting of the
legislative history, the floor statements “emphasize that the nght to confer
relates to the conduct of criminal proceedings after the filing of charges.”!78
For instance, OLC quotes Senator Kyl stating that “[u|nder this provision,
victims are able to confer with the Government’s attorney about
proceedings after charging.”'*°

This is a truncated and deceptive description of the legislative history,
so much so that Senator Kyl sent an angry letter to Attorney General Eric
Holder complaining about the distortion. On June 6, 2011, the Senator
wrote to “express [his] surprise that [OLC is] so clearly quoting [his]
remarks out of context.” Senator Kyl then went on to observe that the
colloquy began by noting that the nght to confer “is intended to be
expansive.”'*! The Senator further discussed various “examples” of when

against that backdrop that Senator Kyl gave the example of conferring
about proceedings “after charging.”

In his letter to Attommey General Holder, Senator Kyl also noted that he

had:
made clear that crime victims had rights under the CVRA even before an indictment is
filed. For example, ... I made clear that crime victims had a right to consult about

both ‘the case’ and ‘case proceedings’—1.e., both about how the case was being
handled before being filed in court and then later how the case was being handled in
court ‘proceedings.’ !?3

Senator Kyl further commented that he had discussed the CVRA’s potential
application in grand jury proceedings, an application that required the Act

Dear Jeffrey, 
Woody has received from his lawyer some questions I asked in in response to the agreement Irwin Tenenbaum 
sent me... .1 found that that agreement generous and reasonable (!), and I'm excited to go forward, but I do need 
those clarifications. We can absolutely agree that we will not give Woody larger or more important billing than 
Bill Clinton or Joe Biden, and that I'd like to come to him to renew our agreement after five years. 
The Harvard week of content in which Woody will appear, if we can sign this, needs to be edited in the next 
week-10 days. We are out of time, which is why I'm writing 
The television show has been picked up by American Public Television, they will distribute nationally, and 
they've asked for another 5 episodes. I so want Woody to be one of those. 
I'd like to see the haiku written by computer. Haiku is not that hard. I'd like to see an elegy written by 
computer.

nothing; no wind chill, nothing. The air was so hot the wind carried no
heat from my hand. When I imagine hot weather it always brings back
this memory. It’s my conscious experience of the world.

Humans experience the world through a vivid lens we call
consciousness. It allows us to think about the world as we watch it and
plan actions. But, it also summons associated memories, something
scientists call ‘qualia. Most writers describe consciousness as an internal
dialogue with themselves and see it as a consequence of human language.
That's probably because most writers are linguists. Non-linguists, perhaps
even dyslexic engineers like me, experience consciousness as more of a
visual dialogue.

It’s hard to pin down consciousness as the difference between
humans and computers. Computers do have something that resembles
consciousness; they have watchdog functions, they plan and anticipate
actions and are aware of their own existence. But they don’t understand
or make free choices based on this consciousness. It is an entirely
mechanistic affair. A computer might know its CPU is overheating and
send a notification message to the administrator, but it does not really
appreciate what this means. It does not have our sensation of a near death
experience. This self-awareness is the ‘hard question of consciousness.
Why, despite the computer knowing it is overheating, does this not
translate into the intense experience we have? Philosophers, such as
Daniel Dennett, think this lack of consciousness is only a matter of time;
once computers live long enough and have sufficient internal complexity
they will begin to experience the world the way we do. We are nothing
special.

The problem with consciousness is it does not seem to have any
externally discernible effect. Anesthetics can take it away and brain
scanners can see that it has been switched off, but what is it for? I think it
comes hand in hand with our faculty of creativity. Consciousness allows
us to shape the world — not the other way round.

Our investigation also uncovered that Desiree’s father had a history of violence toward her.
According to a news report, Desiree’s mother had her father arrested and charged with assault
and battery against Desiree. “In her account,” reported in the media, “Desiree alleged to the
police that her father ‘hit me and pushed my head under the sink...He continued slamming my
head into the wall and the floor. I freed myself and reached for a knife to protect myself.’” A
sworn statement by the mother reportedly said that her husband “flew off the handle” when
Desiree told him “she had lost her virginity.”

In order to avoid his fury once again, this time for having consensual sex with Tyson, she
apparently decided to cry rape once again. At first, she said that he had tried to rape her. She
initially denied having sex with Tyson. Then she said they had sex on the floor. She told the
female chaplain at the hospital that there had been some participation and consensual physical
involvement on her part, before he forced her. Finally, she settled on the account she gave at
trial: that he had raped her on the bed with no prior consensual involvement on her part.

No one except Tyson and Washington knows exactly what went on behind the closed doors of his
hotel room. There was no videotape. Nor was there any physical evidence to corroborate
Washington’s unlikely story. Indeed, the available physical evidence completely undercuts her
story. She was wearing a sequin-studded outfit, which she claims Tyson “yanked” off her as he
“slammed [her] down on the bed.” If that had happened, there would have been sequins all over
the hotel room. Indeed, at the trial, when the dress was gingerly introduced into evidence,
sequins fell off in the courtroom. But only one sequin was found in Tyson’s hotel room after the
allegedly forcible rape.

Nor were there any bruises—external or internal—found on Ms. Washington that were consistent
with her account of how Tyson had “forced” her to have sex. She testified that Tyson “slammed
[her] down on the bed,” got on top of her, held her down with his forearm across the chest, and
forced himself inside her.

Had the 230-pound, muscular Tyson done that to the 105-pound, slight Washington, there would
have been bruises, welts, contusions, and even broken ribs. Yet there was not even the slightest
bruise on Washington’s body when she went to the hospital just hours after the sexual encounter.
The doctors found only two tiny microscopic abrasions, which, according to leading experts, are
perfectly consistent with consensual sex—especially if the man has a larger-than-average penis or
the woman a smaller-than-average vagina. Such tiny abrasions are also more likely when two
people have consensual sex with each other for the first time and are not used to one another’s
sexual movements and desires. Mike Tyson’s account of what occurred, on the other hand, was
entirely consistent with the physical evidence. And it would have been corroborated had the
judge not excluded the three objective eye witnesses who saw them necking and kissing just
moments before they went to his hotel room.

Despite the absence of physical evidence to corroborate Desiree Washington's story, the jury
eventually believed her because there was no compelling reason to disbelieve the testimony of a

young, religious, sexually inexperienced girl who had no possible motive to put herself through
the agony of a rape trial. But it turns out that there were very good reasons for not believing her.

Another person who went to the island with Epstein, Maxwell, and several beautiful women
remembers that the women “sat around one night teasing him about the kinds of grasping women
who might want to date him. He was amused by the idea.... He’s like a king in his own world.”

Many people comment there is something innocent, almost childlike about Jeffrey Epstein. They
see this as refreshing, given the sophistication of his surroundings. Alan Dershowitz says that, as
he was getting to know Epstein, his wife asked him if he would still be close to him if Epstein
suddenly filed for bankruptcy. Dershowitz says he replied, “Absolutely. I would be as interested
in him as a friend if we had hamburgers on the boardwalk in Coney Island and talked about his
ideas.”

BRADLEY J. EDWARDS and
PAUL G. CASSELL,
vs.
Plaintiffs/Counterclaim Defendants,
ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ,
Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff.
___________________________________________/
IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE
SEVENTEENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT
IN AND FOR BROWARD COUNTY, FLORIDA
CASE NO.: CACE 15-000072
DEFENDANT/COUNTERCLAIM PLAINTIFF ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ’S REDACTED
MOTION TO MODIFY CONFIDENTIALITY ORDER
Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff, Alan M. Dershowitz (“Dershowitz”), by and through
undersigned counsel, hereby files his Redacted Motion to Modify Confidentiality Order of
January 12, 2016, and in support thereof states the following:
On January 16, 2016, Defendant Alan M. Dershowitz began the deposition of non-party
Virginia Roberts Giuffre (“Roberts”). Pursuant to this Court’s January 12, 2016 Confidentiality
Order, that transcript currently is under seal. The Confidentiality Order should be modified at
least to allow Dershowitz to defend this case. Dershowitz and his counsel need to be able to
contact witnesses, inform them of Roberts’s testimony, and ask them whether Ms. Roberts’s
testimony is accurate. They also need to be able to use Ms. Roberts’s testimony in other ways as
part of the defense effort, such as by providing it to expert witnesses, among other things. The
bottom line is that Dershowitz’s counsel must be able to use Roberts’s testimony as necessary in
their professional judgment to represent their client, as a matter of fairness and due process.
Accordingly, Dershowitz requests that the Court modify the Confidentiality Order to
confirm that Dershowitz’s counsel may disclose Ms. Roberts’s testimony as they deem necessary
in their professional judgment in order to represent Dershowitz in this case.
BACKGROUND & EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Dershowitz was first presented with Roberts’s heinous and false allegations against him
when her lawyers, Bradley J. Edwards (“Edwards”) and Paul G. Cassell (“Cassell”), filed certain
now-stricken allegations in the action styled Jane Doe, et al. v. United States of America, No. 08-
80736 (S.D. Fla.) (the “Federal Action”). After Dershowitz defended himself to the media,
Edwards and Cassell sued Dershowitz for defamation. The falsity of Roberts’s allegations, her
credibility, and the investigation her lawyers took to assess those allegations and credibility
before filing those allegations are a critical part of Dershowitz’s defense.
On April 9, 2015, Roberts moved for an order “quashing the subpoena duces tecum
served on her by Defendant, or alternatively, pursuant to Florida Rules of Civil Procedure
1.280(c) for issuance of a protective order sharply limiting the scope of the subpoena” (the
“Motion to Quash”). See Motion to Quash, attached hereto as Exhibit A. Roberts did not move
to seal the deposition transcript and the resulting order did not seal it, but instead directed that “a
confidentiality order shall be entered.” See November 4, 2015 Email from Judicial Assistant
Susan Moss, attached hereto as Exhibit B and November 12, 2015 Order, attached hereto as
Exhibit C. The Confidentiality Order then prepared by Roberts’s counsel and consented to by all
parties includes a provision stating that “[t]he deposition testimony of Non-Party Virginia
Giuffre will be designated as ‘Confidential’ and not subject to public disclosure” and that “[i]t
may only be filed under seal.” See January 12, 2016 Confidentiality Order, attached hereto as
Exhibit D.
2
Dershowitz now requests that the Court modify the Confidentiality Order to allow
Dershowitz to use the transcript for those limited purposes as deemed necessary in the
professional judgment of his counsel to ensure Dershowitz is afforded his right to build and
present his defense.
I. DERSHOWITZ MUST BE ALLOWED TO CONTACT WITNESSES AND
ADVISE THEM OF WHAT ROBERTS ALLEGES IN ORDER TO VERIFY OR
DISPROVE HER ALLEGATIONS AND CREDIBILITY AND DETERMINE
WHETHER PLAINTIFFS EVER MADE EFFORT TO CONTACT THESE
INDIVIDUALS TO VERIFY ROBERTS’S ALLEGATIONS AND CREDIBILITY.
As explained by Plaintiffs Edwards and Cassell in their Response to Dershowitz’s Motion
to Determine Confidentiality, the “sexual abuse allegations filed by Edwards and Cassell for
their client Ms. Virginia Giuffre are not peripheral to this lawsuit – they are inherent to it.”
Plaintiffs’ Response to Dershowitz’s Motion to Determine Confidentiality, November 23, 2015,
attached hereto as Exhibit E at 4 (emphasis added). Those “sexual abuse allegations filed by
Edwards and Cassell for their client” go beyond Dershowitz. Another inherent part of this
lawsuit is what investigation, if any, Plaintiffs undertook with respect to the scope of Roberts’s
allegations, all of which bear upon her credibility. Dershowitz argues that Plaintiffs did not
perform a reasonable investigation before making the allegations in the Federal Action.
Plaintiffs argue that they did. Dershowitz must be allowed to contact witnesses and advise them
of what Roberts alleges so that Dershowitz can not only verify or disprove her allegations and
credibility, but also determine whether Plaintiffs ever made efforts to contact key witnesses to
verify Roberts’s allegations and credibility. As explained by one Florida court, “[o]penness in
courts has a salutary effect on the propensity of witnesses to tell the truth” as it “informs persons
affected by litigation of its effect upon them . . . .” John Doe-1 Through John Doe-4 v. Museum
of Sci. & History of Jacksonville, Inc., No. 92-32567-CI-CI, 1994 WL 741009, at *1 (Fla. Cir.
Ct. June 8, 1994) (internal citations omitted).
3
As set forth in Dershowitz’s Motion for Clarification of Confidentiality Order or Relief
from that Order, filed Jan. 29, 2016, it appears that Roberts made false statements in a publicly
filed affidavit about being present at a private island in the US Virgin Islands when former
President Clinton was there. Indeed, former FBI Director Louis Freeh determined based on the
response of the federal government to a FOIA request that the absence of records responsive to
the request “strongly establishes that former President Clinton was not present on Little St.
James Island during the period at issue.” Id. at 2. If Roberts made a false statement under oath
about former President Clinton, it is equally if not more likely that she has made false statements
about others whose whereabouts are more difficult to track.
Roberts cannot reasonably argue her testimony is confidential as she has already
disclosed this same information to the media and others. See Excerpts of Roberts’s Deposition
Transcript, attached hereto (under seal) as Exhibit F. 1
Roberts admitted that she sold her story in
2011, providing the media with the names of her many alleged abusers and providing details so
lurid that even the tabloid refused to repeat all of them. See id.; see also March 2, 2011, Sharon
Churcher, Daily Mail, attached hereto as Exhibit G. Dershowitz has also discovered that Roberts
repeated her allegations about her alleged abusers to many of her friends and family. See Exhibit
F; see also AD-006931-006933, Transcript of Telephone Conversation Between Alan M.
Dershowitz and Rebecca, attached hereto as Exhibit H. As a result, Roberts cannot claim that
these allegations are confidential simply because she repeated them during her deposition.
1 As per the Confidentiality Order, Exhibit F is only filed under seal.

II.
DERSHOWITZ MUST BE ALLOWED TO SHARE ROBERTS’S DEPOSITION
TRANSCRIPT WITH THOSE WORKING ON DERSHOWITZ’S BEHALF AS
PART OF THIS LITIGATION.
Dershowitz asks the Court to modify the Confidentiality Order to allow Dershowitz to
use the transcript in ways necessary for his defense including sharing the transcript with any
counsel and other legal support, experts, consultants, insurers, and others typically permitted
access to supposedly confidential information in addition to using it with potential witnesses and
others as deemed necessary in the professional judgment of his counsel as set forth above.
Dershowitz and his attorneys are aware of and will abide by the Florida Rules of Professional
Conduct, including its comments, regarding the handling of any information deemed by this
Court to be confidential within the limitations of the applicable rules.
III.
ALLOWING DERSHOWITZ TO USE THE DEPOSITION FOR THE LIMITED
PURPOSES OF HIS DEFENSE IS REQUIRED BY FLORIDA LAW.
Florida law requires that any sealing order be the least restrictive means necessary to
accomplish its purpose. The Florida Supreme Court held in Barron v. Florida Freedom
Newspapers, 531 So. 2d 113 (Fla. 1988), that a sealing order can be entered only where “no
reasonable alternative is available to accomplish the desired result, and, if none exists, the trial
court must use the least restrictive closure necessary to accomplish its purpose.” Id. at 118
(emphasis added); see also Carter v. Conde Nast Publ’ns, 983 So. 2d 23, 26 (Fla. 5th DCA
2008) (“an order sealing court records must state, inter alia, the particular grounds for making the
court records confidential, that the closure is no broader than necessary, and that there are no less
restrictive measures available.”).
This Court has not set forth any reasons addressing a request by Roberts to seal her
deposition transcript, much less determined that “no reasonable alternative is available” to
accomplish Roberts’s desired result. See News-Press Publ’g Co. v. State, 345 So. 2d 865, 867
5
(Fla. 2d DCA 1977) (“The judge’s statement that he had ‘cogent reasons’ for sealing the records
obviously fell short of specifically setting forth the reasons why public access to these deposition
was being denied.”). Moreover, Roberts and Plaintiffs cannot argue that sealing her deposition
in its entirety is “the least restrictive” option, as it is most certainly the most restrictive option
and one that Florida courts take very seriously. “[A] closure order must be drawn with
particularity and narrowly applied.” Barron, 531 So. 2d at 117.
Here, that requisite “least restrictive” application requires, at a minimum, allowing
Dershowitz to use Roberts’s testimony for the limited purposes necessary in the professional
judgment of his counsel to represent their client, as a matter of fairness and due process.
CONCLUSION
Because Dershowitz must be able to prepare his defense and any sealing order must be
the least restrictive measure available, the Court should modify the Confidentiality Order to
confirm that Dershowitz’s counsel may disclose Roberts’s testimony as they deem necessary in
their professional judgment in order to represent Dershowitz in this case.

MOTION TO QUASH OR FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER REGARDING
SUBPOENA SERVED ON NON-PARTY JANE DOE NO. 3
Non-party Jane Doe 3, by and through undersigned counsel and pursuant to Florida Rules
of Civil Procedure 1.410(c)(1) 1 , hereby moves for an order quashing the subpoena duces tecum
served on her by Defendant, or alternatively, pursuant to Florida Rules of Civil Procedure 1.280(c)
for issuance of a protective order sharply limiting the scope of the subpoena.
INTRODUCTION
This Court should quash the subpoena issued to non-party Jane Doe No. 3 as it is
unreasonable and oppressive. The Defendant is abusing the subpoena power in an effort to
intimidate, harass and cause undue burden to a non-party. Indeed, Defendant - just days ago -
publicly admitted that his goal of deposing Jane Doe No. 3 has nothing to do with this Florida
Defamation Action; rather, he is trying to find a way to send this victim of sexual trafficking to
“jail.” “She was hiding in Colorado…but we found her and she will have to be deposed. The end
1 For the limited purpose of the Motion to Quash or for Protective Order and resolving the scope of the
subpoena and any enforcement issues, Jane Doe No. 3 voluntarily submits herself to this Court’s
jurisdiction.
result is that she’ll go to jail because she will repeat her lies and we’ll be able to prove it and she
will end up in prison for perjury.” (emphasis added). See Exhibit 1, New York Daily News, April
7, 2015. Defendant has subjected Jane Doe No. 3 to horrific public attacks including publicly
calling her a “prostitute” and a “bad mother” to her three minor children. See Exhibit 2, Local 10
News, January 22, 2015.
Defendant has gone on a media blitz campaign against this non-party for statements she
made under oath in a federal action: “The end result of this case should be she [Jane Doe No. 3]
should go to jail, the lawyers should be disbarred and everybody should understand that I am
completely and totally innocent.” (emphasis added). See Exhibit 3, CNN International, New Day,
January 6, 2015. “My goal is to bring charges against the client and require her to speak in
court.” (emphasis added). See Exhibit 4, Australian Broadcasting System (ABC), January 6,
2015. Defendant also stated, in an interview in Newsmax, that he is “considering” bringing a
lawsuit against Jane Doe No. 3. “And we’re considering suing her for defamation as well, but
right now she was trying to hide in Colorado and avoid service, but we found her and we served
her and now she’ll be subjected to a deposition.” (emphasis added). See Exhibit 5, Newsmax,
April 8, 2015.
Defendant’s own words demonstrate that he is abusing the subpoena power of this Court to
try to get discovery that is irrelevant to this case, in the hopes of being able to intimidate Jane Doe
No. 3 with the press and generate a claim against her. Considering the extensive abuse that Jane
Doe No. 3 suffered as a minor child, and Defendant’s threats and intimidation, it would be both
unreasonable and oppressive to require this non-party to comply with this subpoena duces tecum.
Accordingly, Defendant’s subpoena should be quashed. See Exhibit 6, Defendant’s Subpoena to
Jane Doe No. 3.

BACKGROUND
The underlying action before this Court is a defamation case filed by a former federal
judge, Paul Cassell, and his colleague Brad Edwards, who represent various sexual trafficking
victims in a case pending in the Southern District of Florida, specifically case no. 08-cv-80736-
KAM, hereinafter (“CVRA case”). As a result of an affidavit filed in the CVRA case, Defendant
went on a national media defamation campaign calling, among other things, former federal judge
Paul Cassell and attorney Brad Edwards, “unethical lawyers” who should be “disbarred”. See
Exhibit 7, Today Show, January 5, 2015. In response to this national slander campaign by the
Defendant, Paul Cassell and Brad Edwards filed a defamation case against Defendant in the
Circuit Court of the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit for Broward County, Case No. CACE 15-
000072, hereinafter “Florida Defamation Action”).
Defendant’s statements against Paul Cassell and Brad Edwards are statements about their
character as lawyers and do not directly involve non-party Jane Doe No. 3. Despite this fact,
Defendant is abusing the subpoena power in this case by seeking documents from a non-party that
are irrelevant to the defamation issue before this Court. Defendant is determined to find a way to
harm non-party Jane Doe No. 3 and anyone who braves to represent her. Jane Doe No. 3 has good
cause to be fearful of the Defendant in this matter based on Defendant’s repetitive threats. See
Exhibit 8, Affidavit of Jane Doe No. 3. This Court should not allow Defendant to abuse the
subpoena power to further abuse this non-party. Florida Rules of Civil Procedure provide a
vehicle for this Court to protect a non-party from a harassing, burdensome and unnecessary
subpoena. As explained below, non-party Jane Doe No. 3 should be protected from having to be
deposed in this matter or produce documents. Defendant’s campaign of threats and intimidation
should not be condoned by this Court and Defendant’s subpoena should be quashed in its entirety.

ARGUMENT
1. This Court Should Quash Defendant’s Abusive Subpoena In Its Entirety.
Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.410(c)(1) provides that the Court may “quash or modify
the subpoena if it is unreasonable and oppressive.” Id. The Court has discretion to evaluate the
circumstances in determining whether the subpoena is “unreasonable and oppressive.” Matthews
v. Kant, 427 So. 2d 369, 370 (Fla. 2d DCA 1983). “The sufficiency thereof is a factual
determination for the trial judge who is vested with broad judicial discretion in the matter, and
whose order will not be overturned absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion.” Id.; see also
Sunrise Shopping Center, Inc. v. Allied Stores Corp., 270 So. 2d 32 (Fla. 4th DCA 1972) (Fourth
DCA quashing lengthy subpoena served on non-party who was not in control of documents as
being “oppressive and unreasonable.”). It is undisputed that Jane Doe No. 3 was sexually
trafficked as a minor child by Jeffrey Epstein and he was sentenced for his crimes. Allowing the
Defendant in this case to force this non-party to provide discovery on this highly sensitive topic
would be both oppressive and unreasonable and serves no purpose other than to foster Defendant’s
publicly admitted and utterly baseless campaign to try to send Jane Doe No. 3 to “jail.”
The documents requested in Defendant’s subpoena demonstrate the oppressive and
unreasonable nature of the requests. Defendant, for example, seeks highly personal and sensitive
information from this victim of sexual trafficking, including requesting her personal diary during
the time when she was being sexually abused as a minor child. See Exhibit 6, Request no. 16.
Defendant also demands that this non-party produce photographs and videos of her as a minor
child while she was being sexually trafficked by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. See
Exhibit 6, Request nos. 2, 3, 4 and 10. Defendant’s unreasonable subpoena even includes a
demand for this non-party’s personal cell phone records for more than a three (3) year period
during the time when she was a minor child being sexually trafficked. See Exhibit 6, Request no.
4
15. Defendant also demands items like personal financial documents from this non-party
including payments she received from convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and the men he
“lent” this minor child out to from 1999 – 2002. See Exhibit 6, Request no. 20. It is without
question that Defendant is abusing the subpoena power in this case to conduct a fishing expedition
in an effort to intimidate and harass this victim and to try to dig up information he can use in his
openly stated “goal” to send this non-party to “jail.”
Jane Doe No. 3 is rightfully fearful of Defendant as he is an incredibly powerful individual
and the legal counselor to convicted Jeffrey Epstein who sexually trafficked Jane Doe No. 3 for
years when she was a minor child. See Exhibit 8, Affidavit of Jane Doe No. 3. Jane Doe No. 3
believes Defendant’s goal is to abuse the subpoena power to get her into a deposition so he can
harass and intimidate her by forcing her to discuss the abuse she had to withstand as a minor child.
See Exhibit 8, Affidavit of Jane Doe No. 3. None of that childhood abuse is relevant to this case
which involves the narrow issue of whether Defendant defamed two lawyers. Defendant’s
subpoena is both unreasonable and oppressive and should be quashed. See Matthews v. Kant, 427
So. 2d 369, 370 (Fla. 2d DCA 1983).
2. The Court Should Quash The Subpoena In Its Entirety, But At A Minimum, It
Should Severely Limit The Production Requirements.
In addition to its power to quash the subpoena, Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.280(c)
also allows the Court to protect a non-party from discovery that would result in “annoyance,
embarrassment, oppression or undue burden or expense…” Allstate Ins. Co. v. Langston, 655 So.
2d 91, 94 (Fla. 2003) (Florida Supreme Court overturning denial of protective order and holding
that “[d]iscovery of certain kinds of information ‘may reasonably cause material injury of an
irreparable nature.’”) (internal quotations omitted). Matthews v. City of Maitland, 923 So. 2d 591,
595 (Fla. 5th DCA 2006) (quashing discovery order where “[t]he compelled disclosure… would
create a chilling effect on [petitioners] rights…”). The Court may determine that “the discovery
5
not be had” or that “the discovery may be had only on specified terms and conditions…”. Fla. R.
Civ. P. 1.280(c).
Defendant issued a vastly overbroad subpoena to this non-party which included 25
separate document requests, many with subparts. In addition to placing an undue burden on this
non-party to have to search for the broad scope of materials requested, the document requests seek
information that is irrelevant to the Florida Defamation Action and clearly intended to “embarrass
and oppress” this non-party. Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.280(c). Defendant’s overly broad subpoena to nonparty,
Jane Doe No. 3, goes so far as to seek documents relating to former President, Bill Clinton
and former Vice President, Al Gore, which, even if such documents existed, would be absolutely
irrelevant to the Florida Defamation Action. See Toledo v. Publix Super Markets, Inc., 30 So. 3d
712 (Fla. 4 th DCA 2010).
Defendant’s requests can be grouped into four key categories: (1) documents that contain
highly personal and sensitive information sought only to harass, embarrass and intimidate the nonparty;
(2) documents unrelated to this action and, instead, intended to gain discovery relating to
Defendant’s admitted “goal” of putting this non-party in “jail,” bringing a new case against Jane
Doe No. 3, or related to the federal action; (3) documents that contain personal financial or other
confidential information; and (4) privileged communications between the non-party and her
lawyers. Non-party, Jane Doe No. 3, has filed specific objections as to each request sought in
Defendant’s subpoena as set forth in Exhibit 9. Here, Jane Doe No. 3 provides the Court with a
sampling of the oppressive nature of the subpoena that is the subject of her detailed objections.
a. Category 1 – Overly Broad Subpoena Requests Intended Solely to Harass, Embarrass
and Intimidate the Non-Party by Seeking Highly Personal and Sensitive Information
It is clear from the Defendant’s requests that his intent is to intimidate and harass this nonparty
by seeking highly sensitive personal information that is irrelevant to this action. For
example, Request no. 16 seeks “Any diary, journal or calendar concerning your activities between
6
January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2002.” Defendant is seeking personal diary information during
the time this non-party was a minor child and a victim of sexual trafficking. There is no reason
this non-party should be forced to produce her diary from when she was a child. See Peisach v.
Antuna, 539 So. 2d 544 (Fla. 3rd DCA 1989) (court of appeal holding that trial court departed
from the essential requirements of law by granting deposition of party’s gynecologist which was
only meant to invade privacy and intimidate and harass the party).
Defendant also has a number of requests (Request nos. 2, 3, 4, 10 and 19) that seek
“photographs” and “videos” of this non-party when she was a minor child and during the time she
was the subject of sexual abuse. Photographs of Jane Doe 3 when she was a minor child are
completely irrelevant to the matter before this Court. Defendant served this subpoena demand
solely to intimidate, harass and embarrass this non-party and the Court should preclude this type
of discovery set forth in Request Nos. 2, 3, 4, 10, 15, 16, 19 and 21. See Citimortgage, Inc. v.
Davis, No. 50 2009 CA 030523, 2011 WL 3360318 (Fla. 15 th Cir. Ct. April 4, 2011) (trial court
granting protective order precluding a deposition noting “this deposition request is mere
harassment” and had no relevance to the underlying dispute where the party was wrongfully using
the discovery process for personal gain).
b. Category 2 – Clear Abuse of the Subpoena Power By Seeking Documents Unrelated
to this Action and Intended Instead to Provide Discovery for Other Actions
Defendant is abusing the subpoena power of this Court by issuing subpoena requests that
are intended to obtain discovery for the development of other actions against this non-party and
are unrelated to the instant case. See Exhibit 5, Newsmax Interview (“And we’re considering
suing her for defamation as well, but right now she was trying to hide in Colorado and avoid
service, but we found her and we served her and now she’ll be subjected to a deposition.”).
Defendant has admitted that his “goal” is to put Jane Doe No. 3 in “jail” and he is using this
Court’s subpoena power to go on a fishing expedition in the hopes of fulfilling his ultimate stated
7
“goal.” See Toledo v. Publix Super Markets, Inc., 30 So. 3d 712 (Fla. 4 th DCA 2010) (court of
appeal quashing discovery order where party sought law firm client file relating to a different
matter holding that “curiosity” about a law firm’s records does not satisfy the relevance
requirement and explaining that the contents of the “subpoena is a classic ‘fishing expedition’ and
the trial court’s order departs from the essential requirements of the law.”); Calvo v. Calvo, 489
So. 2d 833, 834 (Fla. 3d DCA 1986) (quashing subpoena served on wife’s bank for financial
records finding them irrelevant: “indeed, the husband has failed to demonstrate what possible
relevance the records might have in the proceeding below other than to harass the wife.”).
(emphasis added).
Defendant’s incredibly broad and unrelated demands include, for example, Request no. 24:
“All documents concerning, relating or referring to your assertions that you met former President
Bill Clinton, Former Vice President Al Gore and/or Mary Elizabeth “Tipper” Gore on Little Saint
James Island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.” See Exhibit 6, Request no. 24. Whether or not Jane Doe
No. 3 met any of these individuals has absolutely nothing to do with the action before this Court.
See Allstate Ins. Co. v. Langston, 655 So. 2d 91, 94 (Fla. 2003) (Florida Supreme Court holding
that “we do not believe a litigant is entitled carte blanch to irrelevant discovery” and ‘“It is
axiomatic that information sought in discovery must relate to the issues involved in the litigation,
as framed in the pleadings.’”) (internal citations omitted). Defendant’s Request demonstrates a
blatant example of abuse of the subpoena power.
Indeed, the face of many of Defendant’s subpoena demands demonstrate that he is using
the subpoena power of this Court to obtain discovery for the federal action. Request nos. 1, 5, 6
and 9 all reference the “federal action” or specifically cite the declaration and case number “OS-
SO736-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON. Request no. 1, for example, demands: “All documents that
reference by name, Alan M. Dershowitz, which support and/or confirm the allegations set forth in
Paragraphs 24-31 of your Declaration dated January 19, 2015 and/or Paragraph 49 of your
8
Declaration dated February 5, 2015, which were filed with the United States District Court for the
Southern District of Florida, in Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 v. United States of America, Case
No. OS-S0736-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON, [ECF No. 291-1] (the Federal Action).” Defendant
should not be using the subpoena power of this Court to issue a non-party subpoena for documents
sought for a federal action. 2
c. Category 3 – Documents that Contain Personal Financial Information Completely
Irrelevant to this Action
Defendant also wrongfully abuses the subpoena power to seek personal financial
information from this non-party. See Woodward v. Berkery, 714 So. 2d 1027, 1034-38 (Fla. 4 th
DCA 1998) (quashing lower court’s discovery order and finding irreparable harm to husband in
disclosure of private financial information when wife’s clear purpose was to wrongfully disclose
the financial information to the press) (emphasis added); see also Granville v. Granville, 445 So.
2d 362 (Fla. 1 st DCA 1984) (court of appeal overturning denial of protective order and finding that
private financial information should have been protected from disclosure).
The requests are clearly meant to intimidate and harass her by, for example, seeking
information during the time she was the subject of sexual trafficking by Jeffrey Epstein. Request
no. 20 seeks “All documents showing any payments or remuneration of any kind made by Jeffery
Epstein or any of his agents or associates to you from January 1, 1999 through December 31,
2002.” Whether Jeffrey Epstein paid minor children that he sexually trafficked has absolutely
nothing to do with the action before this Court and there is no basis to force a non-party who was
subject to this abuse to comply with a production demand on this topic. The subpoena also
includes request for financial information relating to the media. Apparently, Defendant believes
Jane Doe No. 3 has a book “deal” in the works. For example, Request no. 18 seeks: “All
documents concerning any monetary payments or other consideration received by you from any

9
media outlet in exchange for your statements (whether on the record or off the record)
regarding Jeffrey Epstein, Alan M. Dershowitz, Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and/or being a sex
slave.” Whether Jane Doe No. 3 has interacted with the media has nothing to do with the Florida
Defamation Action. As explained above, a non-party’s personal financial information and other
confidential information is subject to protection by this Court. See Woodward v. Berkery, 714 So.
2d 1027, 1034-38 (Fla. 4th DCA 1998). Accordingly, the requests relating to financial
information from this non-party should be quashed 3 .
d. Category 4 – Plainly Privileged Communications
Defendant’s subpoena requests seek documents that are plainly privileged. Florida courts
are unequivocal in stating that an opposing party can never obtain attorney-client privileged
materials. See Quarles & Brady LLP v. Birdsall, 802 So. 2d 1205, 1206 (Fla. 2d DCA 2002)
(quashing discovery order and noting “undue hardship is not an exception (to disclosure of
privileged material), nor is disclosure permitted because the opposing party claims that the
privileged information is necessary to prove their case.”) (internal citations omitted). Non-party,
Jane Doe No. 3, objects to all of Defendant’s subpoena requests to the extent that they seek
documents protected by the attorney client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense and
common interest privileges and any other relevant privilege. Indeed, Jane Doe No. 3 should be
protected from responding to Request no. 25 in its entirety because on its face it seeks solely
privileged and confidential information relating to her retention of BSF. 4
See Westco Inc. v. Scott
Lewis’ Gardening & Trimming, Inc., 26 So. 3d 620, 622 (Fla. 4 th DCA 2010) (court explaining
that “[w]hen confidential information is sought from a non-party, the trial court must determine
whether the requesting party establishes a need for the information that outweighs the privacy
3 These Requests include nos. 9, 17, 18, 20 and 23.
4 Specifically, Request no. 25 seeks: “All documents concerning your retention of the law firm Boies,
Schiller & Flexner LLP, including but not limited to: signed letter of retainer, retention agreement,
explanation of fees, and/or any documents describing the scope of retention.”
10
rights of the non-party.”). Defendant has not established any basis for these privileged and
confidential documents that outweighs this non-party’s privacy rights.
3. The Subpoena Should Be Quashed In Its Entirety. If the Court Will Not Take
That Action, at a Minimum, It Should Grant a Protective Order Severely
Limiting The Areas Of Inquiry At Deposition And Grant Protections For This
Victim Who Is Fearful Of The Defendant.
This Court has the power to preclude and/or limit the deposition of non-party Jane Doe No.
3. Specifically, Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.280(c) allows the Court to prevent a deposition
from going forward “to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression or
undue burden or expense that justice requires,” and courts routinely enter protective orders to
reduce the burden on subpoenaed non-parties to a case, as well as in cases where the discovery
sough is irrelevant. See, e.g., Peisach v. Antuna, 539 So. 2d 544 (Fla. 3d DCA 1989) (holding that
the trial judge erred in allowing the deposition of certain non-parties where evidence sought was
irrelevant); see also Citimortgage, Inc. v. Davis, No. 50 2009 CA 030523, 2011 WL 3360318 (Fla.
15 th Cir. Ct. April 4, 2011) (trial court granting protective order precluding a deposition noting
“this deposition request is mere harassment” and had no relevance to the underlying dispute where
the party was wrongfully using the discovery process for personal gain). Section 4 of Rule 1.280
provides that the Court can also limit the areas of inquiry of a deposition providing “that certain
matters not be inquired into, or that the scope be limited to certain matters.”
Jane Doe No. 3 contends that the subpoena for her deposition should be quashed. If the
Court, however, is inclined to allow a deposition of Jane Doe No. 3, then she respectfully requests
the issuance of a Protective Order modifying the subpoena as set forth below.
a. Testimony Limitations
Non-party Jane Doe No. 3 respectfully requests that this Court limit the deposition to
questions directly related to Defendant’s defamatory statements about Brad Edwards and Paul
Cassell. The Court should limit Defendant’s ability to engage in a “fishing expedition” of this
11
victim to foster his goal of putting her into “jail” or of bringing a new action against Jane Doe No.
3. See Peisach v. Antuna, 539 So. 2d 544 (Fla. 3d DCA 1989); see also Citimortgage, Inc. v.
Davis, No. 50 2009 CA 030523, 2011 WL 3360318 (Fla. 15 th Cir. Ct. Apr. 4, 2011). Defendant
should be precluded from asking any questions about Jane Doe No. 3’s experiences as a sexually
trafficked minor. Defendant should be precluded from questioning Jane Doe No. 3 about
individuals that she was sexually trafficked to or about other victims or individuals involved in the
sexual trafficking orchestrated by Jeffrey Epstein. Defendant should be precluded from
questioning Jane Doe No. 3 about any rapes that occurred when she was a minor child. Defendant
should be precluded from questioning Jane Doe No. 3 about anything related to her sexual activity
either as a minor or thereafter as these questions would only be intended to embarrass and harass
this non-party witness.
b. Language and Harassment Limitations
In addition, Jane Doe No. 3 requests that the Court provide counsel with a cautionary
notice, that counsel for Defendant may not harass the non-party victim in any way during the
deposition. With respect to the language used at the deposition, the Defendant’s counsel should be
directed by the Court to not use any of the derogatory terms the Defendant has used in the press
including calling Jane Doe No. 3 a “prostitute,” a “liar,” or a “bad mother” or any other similar
derogatory and harassing language.
c. Physical Location Limitations
Non-party Jane Doe No. 3 has a valid and real basis to fear being in physical proximity of
the Defendant. See Exhibit 8, Affidavit of Jane Doe No. 3. Accordingly, to the extent a
deposition is to go forward, we would request that the Court direct that the Defendant not be
present in the same room as non-party Jane Doe No. 3 and, instead, follow the testimony
electronically from a separate location. In addition, non-party Jane Doe No. 3 respectfully
requests that the Court hold that the physical location of the deposition should be the offices of
12
Jane Doe No. 3’s attorney’s Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP.
CONCLUSION
WHEREFORE, non-party Jane Doe No. 3 respectfully requests that this Court grant her
Motion to Quash, or alternatively, that the Court enter an order limiting the scope of her document
production and deposition as set forth above.

IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE
SEVENTEENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT, IN
AND FOR BROWARD COUNTY, FLORIDA
BRADLEY J. EDWARDS and PAUL G.
CASSELL,
CASE NO.: CACE 15-000072
Plaintiffs,
vs.
ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ,
Defendant.
/
PLAINTIFFS/COUNTERCLAIM DEFENDANT EDWARDS AND
CASSELL'S RESPONSE TO DERSHOWITZ'S MOTION TO DETERMINE
CONFIDENTIALITY OF COURT RECORDS
Plaintiffs/Counterclaim Defendants Bradley J. Edwards and Paul G. Cassell, by and
through their undersigned attorneys, hereby file this response to Dershowitz's Motion to
Determine Confidentiality of Court Records. The records at issue are not confidential, and so the
Court should deny Dershowitz's motion in its entirety.
The court records at issue are three court filings by attorneys Edwards and Cassell
in which they recite their client's (Mr. Virginia Giuffre's) allegations that she was sexually
abused by Dershowitz. These records are hardly confidential in this defamation case,
where the parties have claims and counterclaims about these sexual abuse
Allegations. Rather, these records are an important part of this case, since they not only
support the conclusion that Dershowitz abused Ms. Giuffre, but also indisputably establish
Edwards and Cassell's strong basis for filing the allegations on her behalf. Moreover,
contrary to assertions made in Dershowitz's motion, these documents have never been
found to be confidential by any other court. And Dershowitz has repeatedly referred to
Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz
Case No.: CACE 15-000072
Edwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records
Page 2 of 20
these documents, not only in defamatory statements broadcast worldwide, but also in his
pleadings before this Court and in recent depositions. Indeed, Dershowitz said in his
media interviews that he wants everything to be made public and implied that Edwards
and Cassell had something to hide. Accordingly, Dershowitz has failed to carry his heavy
burden to justify sealing these presumptively-public documents.
I. DERSHOWITZ HAS NOT JUSTIFIED SEALING ALLEGED
DEFAMATORY RECORDS THAT ARE INTEGRAL TO THIS
DEFAMATION CASE.
In his motion, Dershowitz never recounts the heavy burden that he must carry to seal the
records at issue. To be sure, Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420 allows for the sealing
of confidential materials. But the Rule begins by recounting the overarching principle that
[t]he public shall have access to all records of the judicial branch of government, except as
provided below. Fla. R. Jud. Admin. 2.420(a). This rule is a codification of the Florida
Supreme Court's admonition that a a strong presumption of openness exists for all court
proceedings. A trial is a public event, and the filed records of court proceedings are public
records available for public examination. Barron v. Florida Freedom Newspapers, Inc., 531
So.2d 113, 118 (Fla. 1988) (emphasis added). In light of this presumption of openness, [t]he
burden of proof in [closure] proceedings shall always be on the party seeking closure. Id. To
obtain a sealing order, the party seeking sealing must carry a heavy burden. Id.
Remarkably, Dershowitz fails to acknowledge these well-settled principles. More
important, he even fails to cite (much less discuss) the limited substantive exceptions to this
general principle of access — and which specific exception he believes applies to this
Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz
Case No.: CACE 15-000072
Edwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records

case. Accordingly, it is impossible for Edwards and Cassell to respond with precision to his
motion.
The exceptions that might arguably be in play in this case permit records to be maintained
as confidential in order to:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
(v)
(vi)
Prevent a serious and imminent threat to the fair, impartial, and orderly
administration of justice;
Protect trade secrets;
Protect a compelling governmental interest;
Obtain evidence to determine legal issues in a case;
Avoid substantial injury to innocent third parties;
Avoid substantial injury to a party by disclosure of matters protected by a
common law or privacy right not generally inherent in the specific type of
proceeding sought to be closed;
Comply with established public policy set forth in the Florida or United
States Constitution or statutes or Florida rules or case law ....
Fla. R. Jud. Admin. 2.420(c)(9) (codifying the holding in Barron v. Florida Freedom
Newspapers, Inc., 531 So.2d 113 (Fla. 1988)). The only exception that seems to even arguably
apply here is exception vi, which itself specifically provides that confidentiality is appropriate
only where disclosure is not generally inherent in the specific type of proceeding sought to be
closed (emphasis added). Of course, this lawsuit is a defamation action — involving
a defamation claim by Edwards and Cassell and a defamation counterclaim by
Dershowitz. Disclosure, discussion, and debate about the defamatory statements at issue lies at
the heart of the case. Accordingly, disclosure of these materials is inherent in the case itself.
The principle that defamatory material in a defamation case cannot be sealed is recognized
in Carnegie v. Tedder, 698 So.2d 1310 (2d DCA 1997). Carnegie involved a claim and
counterclaim between two parties (Carnegie and Tedder), one of whom alleged that disclosure of
Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz
Case No.: CACE 15-000072
Edwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records
Page 4 of 20
the materials in the records would be harmful to his professional
reputation. Carnegie recited subsection vi's restriction on release of materials involving a
privacy right, but noted that statements Tedder alleged were defamatory and damaging were
allegations in Carnegie's counterclaim for which she seeks damages.
These matters were not peripheral to the lawsuit; they were inherent to it. Id. at 1312. Of
course, exactly the same principle applies here: sexual abuse allegations filed by attorneys
Edwards and Cassell for their client Ms. Virginia Giuffre are not peripheral to this lawsuit — they
are inherent to it.
To see how inherent the sexual abuse allegations are to this lawsuit, the Court need
look no further than Dershowitz's counterclaim in this case. Count I of Dershowitz's
Counterclaim (styled as False Allegations in the Joinder Motion) contends that Edwards and
Cassell should pay him damages because they filed a pleading in the Federal Action titled 'Jane
Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4's Motion Pursuant to Rule 21 for Joinder in Action' . . . . Dershowitz
Counterclaim at 11 14. Dershowitz's Counterclaim then goes on to quote at length from the
Joinder Motion. His counterclaim contains, for example, this paragraph recounting the
allegations:
The Joinder Motion then goes on to allege — without any supporting evidence — as
follows:
One such powerful individual that Epstein forced then-minor Jane Doe #3 to
have sexual relations with was former Harvard Law Professor Alan
Dershowitz, a close friend of Epstein's and well-known criminal defense
attorney. Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with
Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida
but also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin
Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz
Case No.: CACE 15-000072

Islands. In addition to being a participant in the abuse of Jane Doe #3 and other
minors, Dershowitz was an eye-witness to the sexual abuse of many other
minors by Epstein and several of Epstein's coconspirators. Dershowitz would
later play a significant role in negotiating the [Non-Prosecution Agreement] on
Epstein's behalf. Indeed, Dershowitz helped negotiate an agreement that
provided immunity from federal prosecution in the Southern District of Florida
not only to Epstein, but also to any potential coconspirators of Epstein. Thus,
Dershowitz helped negotiate an agreement with a provision that provided
protection for himself against criminal prosecution in Florida for sexually
abusing Jane Doe #3. Because this broad immunity wouldhave been
controversial if disclosed, Dershowitz (along with other members of Epstein's
defense team) and the Government tried to keep the immunity provision secret
from all of Epstein's victims and the general public, even though such secrecy
violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act.
Dershowitz Counterclaim at 1115 (quoting Joinder Motion at 4).
Remarkably, having quoted at length from the Joinder Motion in his Counterclaim in this
case, Dershowitz now seeks to have that very same language from the Joinder Motion deemed
confidential and sealed. Compare Counterclaim at ¶15 (block quotation above) with Motion to
Determine Confidentiality, Exhibit A at 4 (composite exhibit with proposed confidential
document that includes paragraph beginning [o]ne such powerful individual that Epstein forced
then-minor Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with was former Harvard Law Professor Alan
Dershowitz, a close friend of Epstein's . . . .). Dershowitz cannot come before this Court and
file a counterclaim seeking damages from Edwards and Cassell for alleged defamatory
statements and then ask to have those very same statements placed under seal as
confidential. See Barron v. Florida Freedom Newspapers, 531 So.2d at 119 (although
generally protected by one's privacy right, medical reports and history are no longer protected

when the medical condition becomes an integral part of the civil proceeding, particularly when
the condition is asserted as an issue by the party seeking closure (emphasis added)).
H. JUDGE MARRA'S ORDER IN HIS CASE DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT
THE RECORDS BE SEALED IN THIS CASE.
Dershowitz also appears to contend that Judge Marra's order striking some of the
materials from the records at issue somehow requires that these stricken materials be kept
confidential in this case. Dershowitz's argument misunderstands both the scope of Judge
Marra's order and its effect in this case. His argument rests on a truncated — and misleading --
description of the events surrounding Judge Marra's ruling striking certain documents. A more
complete description makes clear that Judge Marra has not determined the documents are
somehow confidential even in the federal Crime Victims' Rights Act case — much less in this
separate state defamation action.
Edwards and Cassell filed the federal case pro bono on behalf of two young women who
were sexually abused as underage girls by Dershowitz's close personal friend — Jeffrey
Epstein. In 2008, Edwards and Casell filed a petition to enforce the rights of Jane Doe No. 1
and Jane Doe No. 2 under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771, alleging
that the Government had failed to provide them rights with regard to a plea arrangement it was
pursuing with Epstein. Jane Doe No. 1 and Jane Doe No. 2 v. United States, No. 9:08-cv-80736
(S.D. Fla.). In the course of that case, on October 11, 2011, the victims filed discovery requests
with the Government, including requests specifically seeking information about Dershowitz,
Prince Andrew, and others. Further efforts from the Government to avoid any discovery
Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz
Case No.: CACE 15-000072
Edwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records
Page 7 of 20
followed (see generally Docket Entry or DE 225-1 at 4-5), ultimately leading to a further
Court ruling in June 2013 that the Government should produce documents. DE 189. The
Government then produced about 1,500 pages of largely irrelevant materials to the victims (DE
225-1 at 5), while simultaneously submitting 14,825 pages of relevant materials under seal to the
Court. The Government claimed that these pages were privileged for various reasons,
attaching an abbreviated privilege log.
While these discovery issues were pending, in the summer of 2014, Edwards and Cassell,
contacted Government counsel to request their agreement to add two additional victims to the
case, including Ms. Virginia Giuffre (who was identified in court pleadings as Jane Doe No.
3). Edwards and Cassell sought to have her added to the case via stipulation, which would have
avoided the need to include any detailed facts about her abuse. Weeks went by and the
Government — as it had done on a similar request for a stipulation to add another victim — did not
respond to counsel's request for a stipulation. Finally, on December 10, 2014, despite having
had four months to provide a position, the Government responded by email to counsel that it was
seeking more time, indicating that the Government understood that victims' counsel might need
to file a motion with the court on the matter immediately. DE 291 at 3-5. Rather than file a
motion immediately, victims' counsel waited and continued to press the Government for a
stipulation. See id. at 5. Finally, on December 23, 2014 — more than four months after the initial
request for a stipulated joinder into the case — the Government tersely indicated its objection,
without indicating any reason: Our position is that we oppose adding new petitioners at this
stage of the litigation. See DE 291 at 5.
Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz
Case No.: CACE 15-000072
Edwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records
Page 8 of 20
Because the Government now contested the joinder motion, Edwards and
Cassell prepared a more detailed pleading explaining the justification for granting the
motion. One week after receiving the Government's objection, on December 30, 2014, Ms.
Giuffre (i.e., Jane Doe No. 3) and Jane Doe No. 4 filed a motion (and later a corrected motion)
seeking to join the case. DE 279 and DE 280. (Note: DE 280 is the first of the three documents
Dershowitz seeks to have declared confidential in this case.) Uncertain as to the basis for the
Government's objection, the motion briefly proffered the circumstances that would qualify
the two women as victims eligible to assert rights under the CVRA. See 18 U.S.C. 3771(e)
(defining crime victim protected under the Act). With regard to Ms. Giuffre, the motion
indicated that when she was a minor, Jeffrey Epstein had trafficked her to Dershowitz and Prince
Andrew (among others) for sexual purposes. Jane Doe No. 3 stated that she was prepared to
prove her proffer. See DE 280 at 3 (If allowed to join this action, Jane Doe No. 3 would prove
the following .... ). The motion also provided specific reasons why Jane Doe No. 3's
participation was relevant to the case, including the pending discovery issues regarding
Dershowitz and Prince Andrew. DE 280 at 9-10 (explaining several reasons participation of new
victims was relevant to existing issues).
After the motion was filed, various news organizations published articles about
it. Dershowitz also made numerous media statements about the filing, including calling Jane
Doe No. 3 a serial liar who has lied through her teeth about many world
leaders. http ://vvww cnn . co m/2015/01/06/us/dershowi tz-sex -all e gati on/. Dershowitz also
repeatedly called Edwards and Cassell two sleazy, unprofessional, disbarable lawyers. Id. On
Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz
Case No.: CACE 15-000072
Edwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records
Page 9 of 20
January 5, 2015, Dershowitz filed a motion to intervene to argue to have the allegations
stricken. DE 282. Dershowitz also argued that Ms. Giuffre had not provided a sworn affidavit
attesting to the truth of her allegations. On January 21, 2015, Edwards and Cassell filed a
response for Ms. Giuffre and Jane Doe No. 4. DE 291. (Note: This is the second of the three
documents Dershowitz seeks to have kept under seal here.) The response enumerated nine
specific reasons why Ms. Giuffre's specific allegations against Dershowitz were relevant to the
case, including the fact that Ms. Giuffre needed to establish that she was a victim in the case,
that pending discovery requests concerning Dershowitz-specific documents were pending, and
that Dershowitz's role as a defense attorney in the case was highly relevant to the motive for the
Government and defense counsel to conceal the plea deal from the victims. DE 291 at 17-26 &
n.17. The response included a detailed affidavit from Ms. Giuffre about the sexual abuse she had
suffered from Epstein, Dershowitz, and other powerful persons. DE 291-1. On February 6,
2015, Edwards and Cassell filed a further pleading (and affidavit from Ms. Giuffre, see DE 291-
1) in support of her motion to intervene. (Note: this affidavit is the third of the three documents
Dershowitz seeks to have declared confidential.)
On April 7, 2015, Judge Marra denied Ms. Giuffi-e's motion to join the case. Judge
Marra concluded that at this juncture in the proceedings details about the sexual abuse she had
suffered was unnecessary to making a determination of whether Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4
should be permitted to join [the other victims'] claim that the Government violated their rights
under the CVRA. The factual details regarding with whom and where the Jane Does engaged in
sexual activities are impertinent to this central claim (i.e., that they were known victims of Mr.
Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz
Case No.: CACE 15-000072
Edwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records
Page 10 of 20
Epstein and the Government owed them CVRA duties), especially considering that the details
involve non-parties who are not related to the respondent Government. DE 324 at 5 (emphasis
in original). While Judge Marra struck those allegations, he emphasized that Jane Doe 3 is free
to reassert these factual details through proper evidentiary proof, should [the victims]
demonstrate a good faith basis for believing that such details are pertinent to a matter presented
for the Court's consideration. Judge Marra then denied Ms. Giuffre's motion to join the case,
but allowed her to participate as trial witness: The necessary 'participation' of [Ms. Giuffre] ...
in this case can be satisfied by offering ... properly supported — and relevant, admissible, and
non-cumulative — testimony as needed, whether through testimony at trial ... or affidavits
supported in support [of] the relevancy of discovery requests. DE 324 at 8 (emphasis
deleted). In a supplemental order, Judge Marra stated that the victims may re-refile these
documents omitting the stricken portions. DE 325. The victims have recently refiled the
documents.
In light of this history, Dershowitz is flatly incorrect when he asserts that Judge Marra's
Order appropriately precludes the unredacted documents from being re-filed in this case on the
public docket. Confidentiality Motion at 3. To the contrary, the Order specifically permits
factual details about Dershowitz's sexual abuse of Ms. Giuffre to be presented in regard to
pertinent matters in the federal CVRA case. And certainly nothing in Judge Marra's Order could
render those documents confidential in this state defamation case, where the central issues swirl
around Edwards and Cassell's good faith basis for filing the allegations. Indeed, the order is not
binding in any way in this case, because it is res judicata only as to Ms. Giuffre (the moving
Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz

party in that case), not as to her attorneys Edwards and Cassell. See Palm AFC Holdings, Inc. v.
Palm Beach County, 807 So.2d 703 (4th DCA 2002) (In order for res judicata to apply four
identities must be present: (1) identity of the thing sued for; (2) identity of the cause of action;
(3) identity of persons and parties; and (4) identity of the quality or capacity of the persons for or
against whom the claim is made.).
III. EDWARDS AND CASSELL WILL BE PREJUDICED IF THEY ARE
BARRED FROM QUOTING FROM THE RECORD WHILE
DERSHOWITZ IS PERMITTED TO FREELY REFER TO THEM
WHENEVER HE FINDS IT CONVENIENT.
Dershowitz is also incorrect when he asserts that no prejudice will befall Edwards and
Cassell if the records are placed under seal. To the contrary, placing the documents under seal
would permit Dershowitz to continue to misrepresent and distort what is contained in those
records while preventing Edwards and Cassell from correcting those misrepresentations.
Dershowitz has repeatedly referred to details in the records when he has found it convenient to
do so — treating the records as not confidential in any away. One clear example comes from
Dershowitz's recent deposition, where he gratuitously injected into the record a reference to a
portion of Ms. Giuffre's affidavit about him watching Ms. Giuffre perform oral sex on
Epstein. And then, having injected that gratuitous reference into the record, he proceeded to try
to rebut the reference with confidential settlement discussions — but did so by mispresenting what
another attorney (David Boies) had said during the settlement discussions. So that the Court may
have the full flavor of the exchange, the narrow question to Dershowitz (by attorney Jack
Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz
Case No.: CACE 15-000072
Edwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records
Page 12 of 20
Scarola) and Dershowitz's extended answer are quoted in full — including Dershowitz's
reference to the oral sex allegation that he now argues this Court should treat as confidential:
Q. [Y]ou [are] aware that years before December of 2014, when the
CVRA pleading was filed, that your name had come up repeatedly in
connection with Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minors, correct? . . .
A. Let me answer that question. I am aware that never before 2014,
end of December, was it ever, ever alleged that I had acted in any
way inappropriately with regard to Virginia [Giuffre], that I ever
touched her, that I ever met her, that Ihad ever been with her. I was
completely aware of that. There had never been any
allegation. She claims under oath that she told you that secretly in
2011, but you have produced no notes of any such conversation.
You, of course, are a witness to this allegation and will be deposed
as a witness to this allegation. I believe it is an entirely false
allegation that she told you in 2011 that she had had any sexual
contact with me. I think she's lying through her teeth when she
says that. And I doubt that your notes will reveal any such
information.
But if she did tell you that, she would be absolutely, categorically
lying. So I am completely aware that never, until the lies were put
in a legal pleading at the end of December 2014, it was
never alleged that I had any sexual contact with Virginia Roberts.
I know that it was alleged that I was a witness to Jeffrey Epstein's
alleged abuse and that was false. I was never a witness to any of
Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse. And I wrote that to you, something
that you have falsely denied. And I stand on the record. The record
is clear that I have categorically denied I was ever a witness to
any abuse, that I ever saw Jeffrey Epstein abusing anybody.
And -- and the very idea that I would stand and talk to Jeffrey
Epstein while he was receiving oral sex from Virginia Roberts,
which she swore to under oath, is so outrageous, so preposterous,
that even David Boies said he couldn't believe it was true.
MS. McCAWLEY: I object. I object. I'm not going to allow you to reveal
any conversations that happened in the context of a settlement discussion.
THE WITNESS: Does she have standing?

THE WITNESS: No, no, no. Does she have standing in this deposition?

THE WITNESS: I'm not sure she has standing.
MR. SCAROLA: Are we finished with the speech?
MR. SCOTT: No. If he --
MR. SCAROLA: I'd like him to finish the speech so that we can get to my
question
and then we can take a break.
A. So the question -- the answer to your question is --
MR. SIMPSON: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Please don't
disclose something that she has a right to raise that objection if she wants to.
MR. SCOTT: Exactly.
Deposition of Alan Dershowitz (Oct. 15, 2015) at 93-95 (attached as Exhibit 1); see
also Deposition of Alan Dershowitz (Oct. 16, 2016) (attached as Exhibit 2) (also containing
discussion of Ms. Giuffre's affidavit).
The Court should be aware that within approximately two hours of this exchange, Ms.
McCawley (David Boies' law partner) released a statement on his behalf, which stated that
Dershowitz was misrepresenting what happened: Because the discussions that Mr. Boies had
with Mr. Dershowitz were expressly privileged settlement discussions, Mr. Boies will not, at
least at this time, describe what was actually said. However, Mr. Boies does state that Mr.
Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz
Case No.: CACE 15-000072
Edwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records
Page 14 of 20
Dershowitz description of what was said is not true. Statement of Ms. McCawley on Behalf of
David Boies (Oct. 15, 2015).
More broadly, the Court can readily see from this passage how Dershowitz is willing to
inject into the record a part of Ms. Giuffre's affidavit whenever it serves his purpose — and,
indeed, to characterize the part of the affidavit as preposterous. But then he asks this Court to
place the underlying affidavit under seal, so that the Edwards and Cassell stand accused having
filed a preposterous affidavit without anyone being able to assess the validity of Dershowitz's
attack.
Dershowitz has referred to the court records that he now wishes to have the Court declare
confidential not only in his deposition, but also in his widely-broadcast media attacks on
Edwards and Cassell. For example, Dershowitz appeared on the British Broadcasting
Corporation (the BBC) and was asked about the allegations:
Well, first of all they were made in court papers that they don't even ask for a hearing
to try to prove them. They put them in court papers in order to immunize themselves
from any consequences from a defamation suit. The story is totally made
up, completely out of whole cloth.
I don't know this woman. I was not at the places at the times. It is part of a pattern of
made up stories against prominent people and world leaders. And the lawyers in
recent statement challenged me to deny the allegations under oath. I am doing that. I
am denying them under oath, thus subjecting me to a perjury prosecution were I not
telling the truth. I am now challenging them to have their client put these charges
under oath and for them to put them under oath. I am also challenging them to repeat
them outside of the context of court papers so that I can sue them for defamation. . . .
And I will prove beyond any doubt not only that the story is totally false, but it was
knowingly false: that the lawyers and the client conspired together to create a false
story. That is why I am moving for their disbarment in challenges to be provided to
the disciplinary committee.

Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz
Case No.: CACE 15-000072
Edwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records
Page 15 of 20
Similarly, Dershowitz appeared on NBC's Today Show the morning after Edwards and
Cassell made a filing for Ms. Giuffre, to say that the Edwards and Cassell — and Ms. Giuffre —
were all lying in the court documents:
Question from Savannah Guthrie: In legal papers from the lawyers, they say you've
had, in fact, the opportunity to be deposed.
Answer from Alan Dershowitz: They're lying. They're lying.
Question: They show letters in which they offered to depose you.
Answer: And they didn't show my letters in response saying, (a), if you ask me about
my legal relationship with Epstein and I'll be happy to answer. . . . And I responded
that I would be happy to be deposed if you could give me any indication that I would
be a relevant witness . . . . They will be proved — all of them [i.e., Cassell, Edwards,
and Ms. Giuffre] — to be categorically lying and making up this story. And it will be a
terrible thing for rape victims. . . . We [Epstein and Dershowitz] had an academic
relationship. I was never in the presence of a single, young, underaged
woman. When I was with him, it was with prominent scientists, prominent
academics. And they're just — again — lying about this. I never saw him doing
anything improper. I was not a participant. I was not a witness.
Today Show, Jan. 22, 2015 (emphases added).
As another example, in Miami Herald, Dershowitz called the Joinder Motion that he
seeks to have sealed the sleaziest legal document I have ever seen. They [Edwards and
Cassell] manipulated a young, suggestible woman who was interested in money. This is a
disbarrable offense, and they will be disbarred. They will rue the day they ever made this false
charge against me — i.e., Edwards and Cassell will rue the day they ever filed the Joinder
Motion. Miami Herald (Jan. 3, 2015).
Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz
Case No.: CACE 15-000072
Edwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records
Page 16 of 20
Most remarkably, Dershowitz took the public airwaves to represent that he wanted all of
the information surrounding the allegations to be made public, while implying that Edwards
and Cassell had something to hide. For example, on the BBC he claimed that he
wantedeverything to be made public:
Q: Would you encourage that it now be made public?
A: Of course, of course. I want everything to be made public. I want
every bit of evidence in this case to be made public. I want every
allegation to be made public. I want to know who else she's accused of
these horrible crimes. We know that she accused Bill Clinton of being on
Jeffrey Epstein's island and participating in sex orgy with underage
girls. The records of the Secret Service will prove that President Clinton
never set foot on that island. So that she lied. Now it's possible to have a
case of mistaken identification with somebody like me. It's impossible to
have a case of mistaken identification with Bill Clinton.
My only feeling is that if she has lied about me, which I know to an
absolute certainty she has, she should not be believed about anyone
else. She's lied clearly about me, she's lied clearly about Bill
Clinton. We know that. We know that she's lied about other public
figures, including a former prime minister and others who she claims to
have participated in sexual activities with. So I think it must be presumed
that all of her allegations against Prince Andrew are false as well.
I think he [Prince Andrew] should clear the air as well.
If you're squeaky clean and if you have never done anything like this, you
must fight back with all the resources available to you. And that's what I
will do. I will not rest or stop until the world understands no only that I
had nothing to do with any of this, but that she deliberately, with the
connivance of her lawyer, lawyers, made up this story willfully and
knowingly.
BBC Radio 4 - Sarah Montague (Jan. 3, 2015) (http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02g7qbc).
In another widely-broadcast interview on CNN, Dershowitz implied that there is no
evidence supporting the allegations against him:
Edwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz
Case No.: CACE 15-000072
Edwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records
Page 17 of 20
Ask them [Edwards and Cassell] if they have any evidence . . . . They're doing it for
money. She's getting money for having sold her story. She wants to sell the book.
They're trying to get into this lawsuit. They see a pot of gold at the end of the
rainbow. They're [Edwards and Cassell] prepared to lie, cheat, and steal. These are
unethical lawyers. This is Professor Cassell who shouldn't be allowed near a
student. This is Professor Cassell, who is a former federal judge, thank God he no
longer wears a robe. He is essentially a crook. He is essentially somebody who's
distorted the legal profession. . . . Why would he charge a person with a
sterling reputation for 50 years on the basis of the word alone of a woman who is
serial liar, who has lied about former Prime Ministers, former Presidents, has lied
demonstrably.
CNN Live (with Hala Gorani) (January 5, 2015). Of course, by placing the evidence in this
case under seal, Dershowitz will be free to continue to try and insinuate that Edward and Cassell
— and their client, Ms. Giuffre — had no evidence supporting the allegations against him, even
though a mountain evidence strongly support Ms. Giuffre 's allegations. See Deposition of Paul
Cassell (Oct. 16, 2015) at 61-117 (Exhibit 3); see also Depo of Pual Cassell (Oct. 17, 2015)
(Exhibit 4).
CONCLUSION
The Court should deny Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff Alan Dershowitz's motion to
place documents regarding Ms. Giuffre's allegations against him under seal.
I HEREBY CERTIFY that a true and correct copy of the foregoing was sent via E-Serve
to all Counsel on the attached list, this 25f-‘' day of November, 2015.

the fighting near Ismailia, at the northern end of the canal, as Arik Sharon’s
units pushed on after the crossing. The day before the end of the war, both
Amitai and Amiram Levin were part of an operation to take over the Fayid Air
Base across the canal. When an Egyptian RPG hit their Jeep, Amiram was
wounded. Amitai was killed.

I thought, too, of Yishai Izhar: the friend struck down beside me, who I’d
cradled in my arms on the top of my tank, trying to stop the bleeding.

“Oh Ehud,” Nava said. “It’s like 1967 all over again.”
“No,” I said. “Worse. Much worse.”

A few weeks later, | was coming out of the kirya when I ran into another
friend, whom I’d first met at Hebrew University. Like me, he had been a junior
officer in 1967. His name was Ron Ben-Ishai. He would go on to become a top
journalist, covering the military for Israel’s best-selling newspaper, Yediot
Achronot. In the early autumn of 1967, we were still transfixed by the idea of
being able to visit areas of biblical Israel, which for years had been under
Jordanian rule. With a few other friends who were young officers, nine of us in
all, Ron and I embarked on a trek from the southern edge of Jerusalem, weaving
our way through the Judaean Desert toward Kumeran, on the Dead Sea.

Now a very different war had come and gone. I’d fought in it. Ron, as what
is now called an embedded journalist, had been with Danny Matt’s paratroopers
when they’d crossed the canal. He was alongside another of Arik’s units
fighting out of the bridgehead on the far bank of the canal. That both of us had
seen terrible suffering over the past few weeks did not need saying. But Ron
said he wanted to show me something. Fishing into his wallet, he took out a
carefully folded photograph. He had taken it in 1967, just six years earlier, to
mark our Judaean trek. There we were. All nine of us. Young. Full of optimism.
And probably a bit full of ourselves as well.

Ron and I were the only two left alive.

We had won the war, and not just because our forces were now within 60
miles of Cairo, and only 25 from Damascus. We had been attacked by two huge

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021702.txt,"_, Prince Andrew and girl, 17, who sex offender friend flew to Britain to meet him | Mail On... Page 6 of 17

Doe 102 has agreed to waive her anonymity and tell for the first time her deeply disturbing story.

Her real name is Virginia Roberts and she now lives in Australia, where she is a happily married mother
of three.

Over the course of a week during which she spoke at length to The Mail on Sunday, she appeared
sometimes vulnerable, and sometimes steely, but always quietly resolute and consistent.

Revisiting events from a past that she had hoped she had left behind, Virginia occasionally buried her
face in her hands.

Some recollections — and, for reasons of taste, not all the details can be included here — caused her to
flush with shame. ‘I’m telling you things that even my husband didn’t know,’ she said.

Virginia, who has undergone counselling to try to come to terms with her past, is honest about her
initiation into Epstein’s depraved world.

She was a troubled teenager, whose slender figure, delicate complexion, hesitant voice and soulful blue
eyes made her look young for her years.

Born in Sacramento, California, in August 1983, Virginia spent her early years on a small ranch on the
West Coast of America.

This seemingly idyllic childhood ended when she was sexually molested by a man close to her family.

The fallout from that led to her parents temporarily splitting up. Blaming herself, Virginia began to get into
trouble Aged 11, she was sent to live with an aunt but repeatedly ran away.

Living on the streets, she was beaten up and slept with at least two older men in return for food. ‘I was a
paedophile’s dream,’ she says.

Three years later, she was reunited with her family and started a new life with her father who had moved
to Palm Beach,

Florida, where he was maintenance manager at Donald Trump’s country club, Mar-a-Lago.

Virginia got a part-time job as a changing room assistant —which is where, soon after her 15th birthday,
she met Ghislaine Maxwell, who invited her to work as Epstein’s personal masseuse.

‘was wearing my uniform — a white miniskirt and a skin-tight white polo top ~ when | was approached by
Ghislaine,’ Virginia says.

‘I told her | wanted to become a masseuse and she said she worked for a very wealthy gentleman who
was looking for a travelling masseuse.

I'd get training and be paid well.’Virginia’s father gave his blessing, believing his daughter was being
handed the opportunity to learn a skill and to work for a wealthy and respectable employer.

He drove her to Epstein’s pink mansion on the Palm Beach waterfront — he also owns a nine-storey home
in New York, the city’s biggest private residence; a 7,500-acre ranch called ‘Zorro’ in New Mexico and
Little Saint James, a private 70- acre atoll in the US Virgin Islands.

Tonistimmel, yes, the Secret Service guards the president. Today I question the sense of honor and/or discretion
of all politicians and government officials. This is no longer the America we were brought up in. And, Iam not
sure any of them have those qualities, or good intentions they once had.

Rocquedog, the latest info is that Chelsea is not slicks daughter, but is the daughter of Webb Hubbell:

daughter-of-webb-hubbell/. As for Benghazi, I watched the whole thing go down, as I was online when the first
call for help came in. At the time, they claimed that the attack was because of an anti Islamic video. All the
while, unbeknown to us, we were giving the Syrian Rebels arms, which had already been infiltrated by Al
Nursa/A1 Qaeda. In order to keep it all under wraps, Benghazi took care of all credible witnesses. IMHO.

Rocquedog, I agree he is a low life, and Hillary is just as bad. Her relationship with Huma Abedine and
Anthony Weiner leaves room for many questions. Weiner is runner up to slick Willy on preying on young
