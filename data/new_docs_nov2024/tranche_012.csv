October 10, 2010
Dear President Obama,

It seems that the theme emanating from the White House is “Eat,
Pray, Be Disappointed.” And yet, whenever | do feel disappointed, | always
realize that the alternative was John McCain, with Sarah Palin just one
Halloween “Boo!” away from the presidency, and then | always feel a
sense of relief.

Actually, you’ ve kept one big campaign promise--to send more
troops to Afghanistan--so | guess we can’ t fault you for that. In fact,
according to Bob Woodward in Obama’ s Wars, all you want to do now is
get out of Afghanistan. Well, why don’ t you just do what Osama bin
Laden did; cross over to Pakistan. Since we bribe Pakistan to be our ally,
you’ d think they would never consider harboring bin Laden, though they
reek with empathy when our outsourced drones drop those bombs.

Also, during the campaign, you said you believe that the legality of
same-sex marriage should be decided by the states, but that you
personally think marriage should be between a man and a woman. Which

is exactly the position that eventually led to the revocation of Carrie

the patient work of diplomacy, a marked shift from the crisis-to-crisis lurching of
today.

The texture of our values should be everywhere woven into these gatelands we will
cultivate: Democratic choice, freedom of thought, privacy. We won't have time for
leisurely deliberation about ideals in the crashing, time-compacted crises ahead, so
we should begin with them. Let other nations measure gated enclosures for their
different values, marked by their paranoias and historical burdens; our strength will
be an order that reflects our habits of civilization. The curious, open-minded
searching native to our temperament, for instance. This will force constant
innovation and evolution, an antidote to the failure to change that poisons most
closed systems. A continued absence of gates will undo us in the short run. But the
long run will be a disaster if our gates are inflexible, too closed, incapable of upgrade
or —- worse - girded by promises and fears that are not naturally our own.

A second principle is that we ought not force anyone else to use our gated systems.
Gatekeeper or gatekept? No more profound, painful, liberating or enslaving political
choice now exists. Nations must be free to select, in as much as they can, their own
terms of enmeshment. Our aim should simply be to build the best order we can.
America’s tremendous economic and technical lead serves us - for now, at least - as
the isolating stretch of the Atlantic and Pacific once did. There’s no need to force
others to follow us. Recall Greshams’ famous “economic law”: The way in which the
bad drives out the good. A stock market made of swindlers won’t attract investors
for very long. Well, in many networks, a sort of reverse-Gersham’s law applied. The
good drives out the bad. By this I don’t mean merely the self-cleaning properties of
systems like Wikipedia. But of linked systems more broadly. If one nation runs a
DNA database where results are skewed by rules of political power - family
members of leaders get special access for instance — it will make it less effective, and
therefore less appealing as a gateland. So we should be relaxed about letting Europe
or Russia or China try their own gated systems. Their desires reflect sensible,
understandable urges. If you were leading a nation would you rely on Washington’s
trade or financial commitments? Because of the nature of power now many nations
may have no other choice; but forcing them to enmeshment could bring shattering,
unnecessary pressure. Let them divide themselves from us; it will only weaken
them.

We need not evangelize, invade, or compel our way to power. Consider the case of
global trade. For decades after World War Two, many nations sought independence
from economic entanglement. They yearned for autarky. They scorned trade. And
they nearly bankrupted themselves in the process: Want to buy Portuguese cars?
French computers? Indian bikinis? | didn’t think so. The whole point of trade was to
solve such imbalances of skill and trade. When the age of connection began after the
Cold War, most countries made a decisive shift: They arranged their economies to
be attractive to global financial flows. Trade grew twice as fast as the world
economy. The cost of being left out was, and is, a nearly impossible burden.
American systems, if they work for America, should have the same magnetic appeal,

“In the past, only governments had this kind of money, money ofa truly altering scale,” says Epstein in a
chipper and smoothed-out Brooklynese. “In fact, it used to be that the rich, reaching a certain point of
philanthropy, merely hoped to help make the world a better place, now they want to question some basic
assumptions and try change the world. Rockefeller and Carnegie were, as examples of social-engineering
philanthropy, unique for their time . They alone had such resources and will. Now you have legions of people
who must at some point ( hopefully before death, but eventually non the less ) transfer vastly larger fortunes
than Rockefeller or Carnegie had at their disposal, or might even have imagined.

“Except that it turns out it is actually hard to give away this kind of wealth, without unintended negative
consequences that may cause as many problems as you’re solving.”

Epstein’s long-time business thesis is that the hyper rich know very little about the essence of money. They
may know about their own businesses, but the great sums that are realized asa result are ultimately an
afterthought and demand an entirely different sort of intellectual discipline. The Forbes 400, says Epstein, not
immune to an amount of wonder, increased their wealth by $500 billion last year, meaning, in effect, that on
average every Forbes-list billionaire makes more than another billion every year. And, points out the 63-year-
old Epstein, they will almost all be dead in 50 years, most well before that, meaning $4.2 trillion, compounding
everyday, will eventually willhave to be transferred to new hands . “So, to understand the future, what you have
to begin to do is follow the money, not in Watergate- like terms backwards, as in who has gotten it, but forwards
to where it will go and who will get it.”

Epstein can find himself echoing aspects of Thomas Piketty on the inequities of the accumulation of wealth
(“the divide is between people with assets, which appreciate, and people without assets, who fail to
advance—that is, of course, the miracle of compounded interest’’), except for the fact that Epstein, knowing the
rich, understands a point that Piketty doesn’t: “Nobody, nobody, of the hyperwealthy wants to give it all to their
children. Everybody now has the modern appreciation that one of the curses of great wealth is that its burdens
are in many cases too much to handle. One of his rules for the younger generation eventual recipients is that
they all take accounting classes. Along with a video tape of the parents discussing their views on money. This
acts as the bible for the too often conflicts amongst following generations

Epstein’s role in this discussion of the private allotment of what is in fact a decent fraction of the U.S. Gross
Domestic Product is not only as an experienced philanthropist himself but as a sort of adviser or brain—the “
rich whisperer’—making him, in addition to his own vast wealth (two private islands , one for guests ) ,
arguably among the most influential people you’ve only heard of for reasons that have absolutely nothing to
do with his influence.

Epstein sometimes seems to have an out-of-body attitude toward his own fate and bad press—that’s something
that occurs and there is little one can do in the parallel world of the lunchbox crowd . Not long ago, when I
met him for lunch in New York, he noted that he hadn’t been out to eat out in a restaurant in ten years. It was a
not particularly pleasant experience for him and we were done in 30 minutes. ( He said he couldn’t connect
with so many distractions )

On the other hand, Epstein’s life sometimes may seem part of a challenge: not just look at me, but, even I can’t
believe what you see? But, perhaps, he is just naive to what others are thinking: a negligent and ina sense
childish tone deafness.

Press accounts recycle the mysterious billionaire mythology—a man of vast and unsourced riches living in a
parallel world of absolute entitlement—with brief glimpses of him stepping out of the house (the same photos
endlessly republished), and the assumption of wrongdoing inside.

In fact, the life in the house, without wife or children or conventional domestic demeanor, rather conforms to
the scripted fantasies: somewhere between Daddy Warbucks and Eyes Wide Shut. There is indeed a group of
young women—in their twenties and thirties—who act as Epstein’s support staff and companions. Some have
worked for him for many years, marrying, having children, and continuing as part of his business and

court, and the trial judge accepted the plea. The victim then obtained legal counsel and appealed to the Utah Supreme Court,
urging that under the Utah Victims’ Rights Amendment, her right to be heard regarding a plea had been violated. The State
responded that the victim was obligated to ask the trial court directly to be heard rather than relying on the prosecutor to pass
that information along. In rejecting the State's argument, the Utah Supreme Court explained that prosecutors, no less than other
actors in the criminal justice system, were required to assist victims throughout the process. '®° More important for present
purposes, the court also concluded that prosecutors had ethical obligations as officers of the court to convey that information to
the judge:

Prosecutors must convey such requests [to be heard] because they are obligated to alert the court when they know that the court
lacks relevant information. This duty, which is incumbent upon all attorneys, is magnified for prosecutors because, as our case
law has repeatedly noted, prosecutors have unique responsibilities... . The prosecutor is the representative not of an ordinary
party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern
at all; and whose interest ... in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win ... but that justice shall be done. °°

Applying the reasoning of Casey to analogous rights in the CVRA, federal prosecutors must, as officers of the court, convey a
[*871] victim's request to be heard regarding a plea. Indeed, the prosecutor should convey not only the request to be heard but
also the fact that the victim objects to the plea. In deciding whether to accept a plea, the court must consider the public interest.
167 As the Tenth Circuit has explained, Rule 11 also contemplates the rejection of a negotiated plea when the district court
believes that bargain is too lenient, or otherwise not in the public interest.'. !©8 When the prosecutor is aware of an objection
from a keenly interested member of the public - the victim - the court should not be left in the dark about it.

An alternative way of drafting the rule is to require courts to inquire of prosecutors whether the victim has been advised of the
proposed plea and whether the victim wishes to make a statement concerning it. ©? For example, Oregon requires the court to
ask the prosecutor whether the victim has been consulted about a plea and, if so, what the victim's view is:

Before the judge accepts a plea of guilty or no contest, the judge shall ask the district attorney if the victim requested to be
notified and consulted regarding plea discussions. If the victim has made such a request, the judge shall ask the district attorney
if the victim agrees or disagrees with the plea discussions and agreement and the victim's reasons for agreement or
disagreement. !7°

South Dakota law contains a similar requirement that prosecutors disclose any comments by the victim about the plea. !7!

Texas law requires the court to ask the prosecutor whether a victim impact statement has been submitted; if so, the court

Genetics and Propagation

Selective breeding and other botanical techniques are being used to develop cannabis varieties with
desired profiles of compounds, and scientists are developing tools to synthesize isolated cannabinoids
in laboratory settings in order to study cannabis at the genetic level. For example, the first mapping
of a cannabis genome was completed in 2011 by a team of Canadian botanists, led by Jon Page from
the National Research Council Canada and Timothy Hughes from the University of Toronto, who
sequenced 30,000 genes in a sativa variety named “Purple Kush.”

Cannabis Genome

Genetic copies, or “clones,” of cannabis plants are generally produced using two methods, “clone
clipping” and micropropagation, or “tissue culture.” Clone clipping involves cutting a growing
tip from a cannabis plant that is several inches long and inserting the cut tip into a grow-
ing medium, where it then grows into a new plant. Tissue culture involves taking a small tissue sample
(which may even be a single cell) from a plant and growing it temporarily in a sterile nutrient solu-
tion before transferring it to a permanent growing medium. Controlling cannabis plant genomes is
expected to be an important intellectual property issue in the cannabis industry (at least one U.S. pat-
ent has been issued for a strain of cannabis).

concerns towered above all others as 
President Obama addressed a joint session

structural mismatch between the federal

spending commitments. A successful 
second term for Mr. Obama will require 
both credible proposals for overcoming 
those related challenges and the 
determination to carry them through. 
The president addressed the deficit and 
debt first, and at some length. This was 
fitting, giving that the most pressing piece 
of business facing Washington is what to 
do about the impending $85 billion across-

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025041 
in declaring that this so-called sequester 
threatens the military as well as domestic 
programs. But his plan to avoid it basically 
repeated the offer of a balanced approach 
— unspecified tax hikes and spending cuts 
— which Republicans have already 
rejected. 
Somewhat more substantively, he called for 
a larger deficit-reduction deal built around 
loophole-closing tax reform and what he 
called modest reforms to Medicare and 
entitlements. In an apparent effort to rally 
Democrats to this cause, he called on 
those of us who care deeply about 
programs like Medicare to embrace 
reform. 
Yet in promising the same amount of 
Medicare savings as the Simpson-Bowles 
commision proposed, Mr. Obama did not 
mention that this would be a mere $341 
billion over 10 years. All told, he envisions 
shaving an additional $1.5 trillion off 
projected deficits over 10 years, which 
would leave the national debt at a 
historically aberrant 70-odd percent of 
gross domestic product. In short, he 
declined to push back against the mind-set 
within his party that considers acceptable 
stabilizing the debt at this level by the 
time Mr. Obama's second term ends. At 
best, that would buy a respite of a few 
years before the debt resumed its upward 
climb. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025042 
As for raising the economy's growth 
potential, the president was more 
persuasive. His emphasis on reforming the 
tangled and counterproductive corporate 
tax code was especially welcome, and 
relatively likely to draw GOP support. He 
offered several promising ideas on 
education, including a promise of high-
quality preschool for all children, though 
how that would square with his promise not 
to increase the deficit by a single dime 
went unexplained. He sounded a ringing 
call for greater federal attention to college 
cost containment. Taxpayers can't keep on 
subsidizing spiraling tuition, he said, 
candidly and correctly. 
As European trading partners had hoped, 
the president endorsed negotiations for a 
transatlantic free-trade zone, which would 
help America's export industries and the 
jobs that depend on them. Coupled with an 
agreement that Obama is promoting for the 
Pacific region, the proposal has the 
potential to make his second term fruitful 
for global trade. He also suggested raising 
the federal minimum wage, from $7.25 per 
hour to $9 — although the precise amount 
is less important, in our view, than the 
president's call for annual cost-of-living 
adjustments. 
In keeping with Mr. Obama's theme of 
nation-building at home, foreign policy 
played a secondary role in his speech. He 
promised to bring home half of the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025043 
remaining U.S. troops in Afghanistan 
within the next year. But officials said the 
withdrawal would be weighted toward 
year's end, leaving most of the troops to 
partner with Afghan troops for much of this 
year. The president said the United States 
would support democratic transitions in the 
Middle East, keep the pressure on [the] 
Syrian regime and do what is necessary 
to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear 
weapon — but he offered no specifics. 
Mr. Obama pressed his case for reform of 
immigration laws and for action to slow 
global warming — and, in especially 
moving terms, tougher gun laws. In each 
case, there may be measures he can take 
through executive action, but new laws will 
be needed for substantial progress. 
Mr. Obama was right when he pointed to 
the survivors and grieving relatives of gun 
violence victims and insisted, They 
deserve a vote. 
Article 2 
Foreign Policy 
The world is no longer 
America's problem  
Aaron David Miller 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025044 
February 13, 2013 -- If you want to know 
what an American president's foreign 
policy is likely to be, particularly in a 
second term, don't listen to his State of the 
Union speech. You'd probably have more 
luck playing with Tarot cards, or reading 
tea leaves or goat entrails. But not this year. 
Barack Obama's fourth such address left a 
trail of foreign-policy cookie crumbs that 
lead directly to some pretty clear, if hardly 
surprising or revolutionary, conclusions. 
His first term contained no spectacular 
successes (save killing Osama bin Laden), 
but no spectacular failures either. And 
more than likely, that's what the president 
will settle for in a second, even as the Arab 
world burns and rogues like Iran and North 
Korea brandish new weapons. He's nothing 
if not a cautious man. 
Behold: I am the Extricator in Chief 
Afghanistan -- the good war -- has been 
pretty much MIA in Obama's speeches 
since he became president. He's alternated 
between spending a few words on the 
mission there (2009) or a paragraph (2010, 
2011, 2012). If his words have been brief, 
the message has been stunningly clear: It's 
about the leaving. And tonight was no 
exception. Not more than two minutes in, 
the president spoke about America's men 
and women coming home from 
Afghanistan. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025045 
Obama's signature is indeed that of the 
extricator. And he broke the code early (the 
2009 surge was designed politically to get 
in so that he could get out with a clearer 
conscience). He is the president who has 
wound down the longest and among the 
most profitless wars in American history, 
where victory was never defined by 
whether we can win, but by when can we 
leave. It is his legacy, and one about which 
he has reason to be proud. Obama has left 
himself and his military commanders 
plenty of discretion about the pace of 
extrication. But that's fine with the 
president so long as they're heading for the 
exits. 
Not the Destroyer and Rebuilder of Worlds 
Surprise, surprise: There was scant mention 
of Syria in the president's speech -- just one 
throwaway line about supporting Syria's 
opposition. Obama did not disengage from 
Iraq and Afghanistan only to plunge 
America into new black holes in the 
Middle East. 
Obama isn't worried about boots on the 
ground in Syria. That was never on the 
table. Instead the question is this: Given the 
uncertainty about the end state in Syria and 
the risks of providing serious weapons to 
the rebels (and a no-fly zone) that might 
alter the arc of the fight against the regime, 
the president saw and continues to see no 
purpose in America providing arms of 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025046 
marginal utility. That course would either 
expose him to be truly weak and ineffectual 
or lead to calls to do more. So he's going to 
provide non-lethal support and is 
apparently prepared to take the hits from 
critics who see the president's policy as 
passive, cruel, and unforgiving, particularly 
now that we know that members of his own 
cabinet clearly wanted to do more. The 
Iranian nuclear issue, the other potential tar 
baby in the SOTU, followed a pretty 
predictable rising arc of concern in the list 
of presidential foreign-policy worries. In 
2009, in Obama's address to a joint session 
of Congress (a speech some regard as a 
SOTU), Iran wasn't even mentioned. In the 
2010 SOTU, Obama threatened that if Iran 
ignored its international obligations, there 
would be consequences; in 2011, he did the 
same; and in 2012, he made it clear that he 
would prevent Iran from acquiring a 
nuclear weapon and take no option off the 
table. Obama repeated half of what he said 
in 2012 about preventing Iran from getting 
a nuclear weapon, but instead of saying all 
options were on the table, he spoke of the 
importance of diplomacy. I suspect he'll go 
to extreme lengths to avoid war, and won't 
greenlight an Israeli attack either until the 
arc of diplomacy has run its course. And 
then Obama would likely act only if the 
mullahs push the envelope by accelerating 
their uranium enrichment program and 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025047 
other military aspects of the nuclear 
enterprise. 
Seizing the Nuclear High Road with Little 
to Lose 
Even as he confronts a real bomb in North 
Korea (very bad options there) and a 
potential one in Iran (bad options there 
too), Obama is trying to make good on a 
longstanding commitment to reduce 
America's own nuclear arsenal. Backed by 
the military chiefs and likely by the public 
too (getting rid of nukes equals saving 
money), but opposed by Republicans in 
Congress, Obama will try to work around 
the political obstacles by seeking a deal 
with yes ... you got it ... his old friend Vlad 
Putin. It's worth a try. If Putin balks or 
Republicans get in the way, the president 
can always advocate unilateral cuts -- not 
something he wants to do. But if he can't 
have his way on nukes, he can always 
blame it on the Russians and the 
Republicans with little to lose. The road to 
getting rid of nukes is a long one. Let the 
next guy (or gal) worry about it. 
A Little Leg on Palestine? 
Obama hasn't mentioned the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict in a SOTU speech since 
2009. And that's no coincidence. His own 
poorly thought-through initial effort 
crashed and burned, leaving the president 
pretty frustrated and annoyed with both 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025048 
Israelis and Palestinians, particularly Israeli 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
But hey, that was then. A second-term 
president has committed himself early in 
2013 to a trip to Israel and has an Energizer 
bunny in Secretary of State John Kerry, 
who wants to do the right thing and keep 
the two-state solution alive. Obama clearly 
kept his distance from the issue again on 
Tuesday night. He spoke of standing with 
Israel to pursue peace, but didn't mention 
Palestinians or the peace process. He 
mentioned his own trip to the Middle East, 
but missed an opportunity to give what 
might be a trip to the region by his new 
secretary of state higher profile. It's just as 
well. The paradox of the Israeli-Palestinian 
issue is that it's too complicated to 
implement right now and too important to 
abandon. It's in this space that Obama will 
be forced to operate. And while the odds of 
success are low, Obama will be tempted in 
his final term to do something bold, 
perhaps laying out a U.S. plan of 
parameters on the key final-status issues. 
It's the Middle Class, Not the Middle East 
Spoiler alert: Barack Obama might still be 
a consequential foreign-policy president if 
he's lucky, willful, and skillful. But it's his 
domestic legacy that will make or break his 
presidency. Health care -- his signature 
legacy issue -- will look much better if the 
economy improves, driven by a revived 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025049 
housing market and rising employment, 
and of course if some broader deal can be 
struck on entitlements and taxes. 
Immigration reform and gun-control 
legislation driven by a functional 
bipartisanship would cement that legacy. 
He'd be an historic rather than a great 
president. 
Two clocks tick down in a president's 
second term: the drive for legacy and the 
reality of lame duckery. Obama's political 
capital will diminish quickly. Where, how, 
and on what he wants to spend it is critical. 
The Middle East is violent and volatile and 
may yet suck him in, but if he can avoid it, 
he'll try. This was a State of the Union 
address that stressed fixing America's 
broken house, not chasing around the world 
trying to fix everyone else's. The future of 
America isn't Cairo or Damascus; it's 
Chicago and Detroit.

Can the United States  
Strike a Deal with Iran?  
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025050 
Patrick Seale 
12 Feb 2013 -- Negotiations with Iran are 
once more on the international agenda. 
After an eight-month break, the five 
permanent members of the UN Security 
Council plus Germany -- the so-called 
P5+1 -- are due to hold a meeting with Iran 
on 25 February in Kazakhstan. What are 
the prospects of success? In a nutshell, that 
would seem to depend more on the climate 
in Washington than in Tehran. Iran is 
gesturing that it wants to negotiate, but 
Washington has not yet signalled any 
greater flexibility than in the past. 
In a major speech in Tehran last Sunday, 
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 
addressed the United States: Take your 
guns out of the face of the Iranian nation 
and I myself will negotiate with you, he 
declared. Meanwhile, the Iranian 
ambassador to Paris told French officials 
that, provided a work plan was agreed, Iran 
was ready to allow inspectors of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) to visit Parchin, a military facility 
where Iran is suspected of having done 
work on atomic weapons. Ahmadinejad 
himself has said repeatedly that Iran was 
ready to stop enriching uranium to 20% if 
the international community agreed to 
supply it instead to the Tehran research 
reactor for the production of isotopes 
needed to treat cancer patients. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025051 
The only recent encouraging word from the 
United States was a hint by Vice-President 
Joe Biden at last week's Munich security 
conference that the time may have come 
for bilateral U.S.-Iranian talks. Iran's 
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi 
responded positively to Biden's offer, 
although he added that Iran would look for 
evidence that Biden's offer was 'authentic' 
and not 'devious'. 
The road to a U.S.-Iranian agreement is 
littered with obstacles -- grave mutual 
distrust being one of them. There is little 
optimism among experts that a 
breakthrough is imminent. For one thing, 
Iran is almost certain to want to defer any 
major strategic decision until a new 
President is elected next June to replace the 
sharp-tongued Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. To 
strike a deal with Iran, the United States 
would also need to assure its Arab allies in 
the Gulf that they would not fall under 
Iranian hegemony or lose American 
protection. Guarantees would no doubt 
have to be given. 
Israel, America's close ally, poses a more 
substantial obstacle. It is totally opposed to 
any deal which would allow Iran to enrich 
uranium, even at the low level of 3.5%. 
Wanting no challenge to its own 
formidable nuclear arsenal, Israel's long-
standing aim has been to halt Iran's nuclear 
programme altogether. To this end it has 
assassinated several Iranian nuclear 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025052 
scientists and joined the United States in 
waging cyber warfare against Iranian 
nuclear facilities. Its belligerent prime 
minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has for 
years been pressing Obama to destroy 
Iran's nuclear programme and -- better still 
-- bring down the Islamic regime 
altogether. 
Faced with these obstacles, it is clear that 
any U.S. deal with Iran would require 
careful preparation. Obama would need to 
mobilize strong domestic support if he is to 
confront America's vast array of pro-Israeli 
forces. They include Congressmen eager to 
defend Israeli interests at all costs (as was 
vividly illustrated by the recent Chuck 
Hagel confirmation hearings), powerful 
lobbies such as AIPAC, media barons, 
high-profile Jewish financiers like Sheldon 
Adelson, a phalanx of neo-con strategists in 
right-wing think tanks, influential pro-
Israelis within the Administration, and 
many, many others. The cost in political 
capital of challenging them could be very 
substantial. Nevertheless, elected for a 
second term, he now has greater freedom 
and authority than before. 
Obama is due to visit Israel on March 20-
21, something he did not do in his first 
term. This visit will be the first foreign trip 
of his second term -- in itself a sign of its 
importance. Although the White House is 
anxious to play down suggestions that he 
will announce a major initiative, either on 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025053 
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or on Iran, 
there are issues he cannot avoid. He may, 
however, choose to raise them in private 
talks with Israeli leaders rather than in 
public. His message is expected to be 
twofold: Israel should not delay in granting 
statehood to the Palestinians, however 
painful that choice may be, and it should be 
careful not to make an eternal enemy of 
Iran. Both conflicts have the potential to 
isolate Israel internationally and threaten its 
long-term interests, if not its actual 
existence. 
In his first term of office, Obama resisted 
Netanyahu's pressure to wage war on Iran. 
This was no more than a semi-success, 
however, since he managed to blunt 
Netanyahu's belligerence only by imposing 
on Iran a raft of sanctions of unprecedented 
severity. They have halved Iran's oil 
exports, caused its currency to plummet 
and inflation to gallop, severed its relations 
with the world's banks and inflicted severe 
hardship on its population. 
The key question today is this: What are 
Obama's intentions? Is he seeking to bring 
down Iran's Islamic regime, as Israel 
would like, or is he simply seeking to limit 
its nuclear ambitions? If 'regime change' is 
his aim then sanctions will have to be 
tightened even further and extended 
indefinitely. But if Obama's aim is to strike 
a deal with Iran over its nuclear programme 
then he must give it at least some of what it 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025054 
wants: such as sanctions relief; acceptance 
of its right under the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty to enrich uranium to a 
low level for peaceful purposes; 
recognition of its security interests, of the 
legitimacy of its Islamic regime born out of 
the 1979 revolution, and of its place in the 
region as a major power. 
The P5+1, which are due to meet Iran later 
this month, remain so divided that they are 
unlikely to improve substantially on their 
previous miserly offer, which was to 
provide Iran with some airplane spare parts 
if it gave up uranium enrichment to 20% --
its trump card. It is the paralysis of Iran's 
dealings with the P5+1 that has lent 
credence to the idea that the best hope of a 
breakthrough may lie in bilateral U.S.-
Iranian talks -- perhaps even a summit 
meeting between President Obama and 
Ayatollah Khomeini. 
For such a summit to be successful the 
United States would have to change its 
approach. Iran's supreme leader has made 
clear that Iran will not negotiate under 
threat of attack. There would have to be 
give and take. Above all, Iran wants to be 
treated with respect. This is the challenge 
facing Obama. 
It is worth remembering that there is as yet 
no evidence whatsoever that Iran has 
decided to build nuclear weapons. Nor has 
it developed a reliable delivery system. 
Instead, it has focussed its efforts on 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025055 
medium-range missiles unable to reach 
Israel. It has no second strike capability. As 
President Ahmadinejad stressed during his 
visit to Cairo last week, Iran has no 
intention of attacking Israel. Its posture is 
purely defensive. 
If Obama were to act with boldness and 
vision, he could defuse a nagging problem 
which has plagued the region for years. It is 
surely time for the United States to draw 
Iran into the regional community of nations 
and put an end to 34 years of unremitting 
hostility.

What path now for Syria?  
David Ignatius  
February 12, 2013 -- Syrian opposition 
fighters appear to be making significant  
gains on the battlefield this week, 
following an offer by their top political 
leader for negotiations with the regime of 
President Bashar al-Assad. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025056 
This military and diplomatic news may 
appear positive. But Syrian sources caution 
that the battlefield advances may accelerate 
movement toward a breakup of the country, 
as Alawite supporters of the regime retreat 
to their ancestral homeland in the 
northwestern region around Latakia. And 
there's no sign that either Assad or his 
Russian patrons are paying any more than 
lip service to a political settlement. 
One potential game-changer is a request for 
U.S. help in training elite rebel units, which 
has been drafted by Brig. Gen. Salim Idriss, 
the new commander of the opposition Free 
Syrian Army. In a letter dated Feb. 4, he 
seeks U.S. assistance in training for: (1) 
special operations; (2) international 
humanitarian law; and (3) ... in chemical 
weapons security. 
Idriss requested various supplies for these 
elite units, including: (1) combat armor; 
(2) night vision goggles; (3) hand held 
monocular and longer range spotting 
equipment; (4) strategic communications; 
(5) winterization packs; and (6) tactical 
communications. 
This request for assistance was made just 
after the Assad regime had rebuffed an 
offer by Sheik Ahmad Moaz al-Khatib, the 
head of a new opposition coalition, to 
negotiate with government representatives. 
The rebels' recent military successes have 
come mostly in northern Syria; the attacks 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025057 
were made by different battalions that 
appear to operate with little central 
command and control. The gains include: 
*The al-Jarrah air base, about 30 miles east 
of Aleppo, which appears to have been 
overrun by fighters from Ahrar al-Sham, a 
battalion based in Idlib. Videos posted 
Tuesday by the rebels showed them 
walking past derelict Syrian warplanes and 
inside a fortified hangar containing what 
appeared to be two Czech-built ground 
assault planes. On camera, the rebels 
displayed dozens of bombs racked in a 
warehouse, and other ammunition and 
spoils of war. 
*The Thawra hydroelectric dam on the 
Euphrates, which is one of Syria's biggest 
power-generating facilities. Rebel sources 
said the Syrian army gave up the strategic 
dam after army positions there were 
overrun. The rebels negotiated a surrender 
with regime loyalists who remained. These 
sources said the dam continues to operate 
and provide power — a positive sign for 
those who worry that Syria's infrastructure 
would collapse if the rebels took over. 
*The Aleppo International Airport, 
southeast of the city, is close to falling. 
Free Syrian Army sources said Tuesday 
that their fighters, including allies in the 
extremist al-Nusra Front, had captured an 
access point near the airport known as 
Liwa 80. Syrian sources said rebels there 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025058 
had seized large amounts of ammunition, 
including some shoulder-fired anti-aircraft 
missiles. 
*Damascus and its suburbs, where the 
rebels are tightening their squeeze on 
access points to the capital. Syrian sources 
said fighters are converging on Damascus 
from different parts of the country, 
expecting a decisive battle there soon. 
Regime forces are suffering from very low 
morale, whereas FSA soldiers have been 
encouraged by recent positive 
developments, asserts one FSA report 
from Damascus. 
The al-Nusra Front has been a catalyst and 
beneficiary of the rebels' success. 
According to Syrian sources, al-Nusra is 
gaining strength in Homs, a city in central 
Syria where the group was never strong. 
One Syrian source told the State 
Department: They have money, they are 
helping people with everything including 
daily living supplies. I heard that some 
fighters are leaving their [former] brigades 
and joining [Al-Nusra], some of them 
selling their weapons to feed their 
families. 
One Syrian who works closely with the 
Free Syrian Army explained how creating 
an elite commando force could help check 
Syria's drift toward becoming a failed 
state: We still believe FSA on the ground 
is still needed badly to tip the power and 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025059 
support other parallel solutions, including 
the political one. But FSA [has] become a 
jungle. ... My recommendation is ... to 
start working on elite [forces that can] ... 
initiate key attacks plus help as a buffer 
from potential warlords and fights among 
fragmented FSA factions. Plus, this unit 
can handle other key tasks, like securing 
chemical weapons. 
This Syrian strategist argues in another 
memo that the rebels must speak to the 
silent majority, many who did not care 
about the revolution, and they want their 
life back. He said that such a negotiated 
settlement requires more pressure on the 
United States, Russia and the United 
Nations to find a way out of the 
deadlock.

Foreign Policy 
Why Does Europe  
Pretend Hezbollah Has a  
Good Side?  
Matthew Levitt 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025060 
February 12, 2013 -- Bulgaria's interior 
minister announced on Feb. 5 the result of 
his country's investigation into the July 
2012 bombing of a bus filled with Israeli 
tourists in the city of Burgas, which killed 
five Israelis and the vehicle's Bulgarian 
driver. Two of the individuals who carried 
out the terrorist attack, he said, belonged 
to the military formation of Hezbollah. 
It was not by chance that his statement 
fingered only the military wing of 
Hezbollah, not the group as a whole. 
Within the European Union, the findings of 
the Bulgarian investigation have kicked off 
a firestorm over whether to add the 
Lebanese militant organization -- in whole, 
or perhaps just its military or terrorist 
wings -- to the EU's list of banned terrorist 
groups. But are there in fact distinct wings 
within the self-styled Party of God? 
Hezbollah is many things. It is one of the 
dominant political parties in Lebanon, as 
well as a social and religious movement 
catering first and foremost -- though not 
exclusively -- to Lebanon's Shiite 
community. Hezbollah is also Lebanon's 
largest militia, the only one to keep its 
weapons and rebrand its armed elements as 
an Islamic resistance in response to the 
terms of the 1989 Taif Accord, which 
ended the Lebanese Civil War. 
While the group's various elements are 
intended to complement one another, the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025061 
reality is often messier. In part, that has to 
do with compartmentalization of 
Hezbollah's covert activities. It is also, 
however, a result of the group's multiple 
identities -- Lebanese, pan-Shiite, pro-
Iranian -- and the group's multiple and 
sometimes competing goals tied to these 
different identities. 
Hezbollah's ideological commitment to 
Iranian Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's 
revolutionary doctrine of velayat-e 
faqih (guardianship of the jurist), which 
holds that a Shiite Islamic cleric should 
serve as the supreme head of government, 
is a key source of conflict. The group is 
thus simultaneously committed to the 
decrees of Iranian clerics, the Lebanese 
state, its sectarian Shiite community within 
Lebanon, and fellow Shiites abroad. 
The consequences of these competing 
ideological drivers was clear in July 2006, 
when Hezbollah dragged Israel and 
Lebanon into a war neither state wanted by 
crossing the U.N.-demarcated border 
between the two countries, killing three 
Israeli soldiers, and kidnapping two more 
in an ambush. They came to the fore again 
two years later, when Hezbollah took over 
West Beirut by force of arms, turning its 
weapons of resistance against fellow 
Lebanese citizens. When the chips are 
down, Hezbollah's commitment to Iran 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025062 
trumps its identity as a Lebanese political 
movement. 
The ties that bind Hezbollah's political 
leadership with its international illicit 
activities are also unmistakable. According 
to a CIA document, even before Hassan 
Nasrallah rose to the position of secretary-
general in 1992, he was directly involved 
in many Hizballah terrorist operations, 
including hostage taking, airline hijackings, 
and attacks against Lebanese rivals. 
Time and again, Hezbollah's political 
personalities have been tied to the group's 
terrorist and criminal activities. Consider a 
major case in the United States: In 2008, 
while Hezbollah operative Ali Karaki was 
planning a Hezbollah attack in Azerbaijan's 
capital, Baku, his brother, Hasan Antar 
Karaki, was helping lead a broad criminal 
conspiracy to sell counterfeit and stolen 
currency in Philadelphia. Luckily, Hasan 
Antar Karaki sold his wares to an 
undercover FBI informant posing as a 
member of the Philadelphia criminal 
underworld. Hasan Antar Karaki proved to 
be a major figure in Hezbollah's forgery 
operations, and he provided an FBI source 
with fraudulent British and Canadian 
passports. 
Meanwhile, in meetings in Lebanon and 
the United States, Hasan Antar Karaki's 
associate, Hassan Hodroj, a Hezbollah 
spokesman and the head of its Palestinian 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025063 
issues portfolio within the group's political 
echelon, sought to procure a long list of 
sophisticated weapons in a black-market 
scheme involving Hezbollah operatives 
across the globe. According to court 
documents, Hodroj wanted heavy 
machinery for the fight against Jews and 
to protect Lebanon. But move forward 
with caution, Hodroj counseled an 
undercover FBI source, because someone 
in the United States could go to jail for 
100 years if caught dealing with 
Hezbollah. 
In light of cases like this one, in which 
people overtly affiliated with Hezbollah's 
political activities are engaged in criminal 
and terrorist activities, it becomes 
increasingly difficult to separate 
Hezbollah's overt activities from its covert 
behavior. Little is known about [the 
Hezbollah military wing's] internal 
command hierarchy, a Western 
government report noted in 2012, due to 
its highly secretive nature and use of 
sophisticated protective measures. 
The structure and manpower of Hezbollah's 
terrorist operation, which is responsible for 
its financial and logistical activities as well 
as its terrorist operations abroad, are 
similarly opaque. We do know, however, 
that Hezbollah's terrorist network, the 
Islamic Jihad Organization (IJO), was 
formally founded in 1983 when Hezbollah 
master terrorist Imad Mughniyeh fled to 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025064 
Iran after orchestrating the October 1983 
bombing of the U.S. Marine Corps and 
French military barracks in Beirut with his 
brother-in-law, Mustafa Badreddine. 
This much is clear: Since its founding, 
Hezbollah has developed a sophisticated 
organizational and leadership structure. 
The overall governing authority, the Majlis 
al-Shura (Consultative Council), wields all 
decision-making power and directs several 
subordinate functional councils. Each 
functional council reports directly to the 
Majlis al-Shura, which, as Hezbollah 
Deputy Secretary-General Naim Qassem 
wrote in his book, is in charge of drawing 
the overall vision and policies, overseeing 
the general strategies for the party's 
function, and taking political decisions. 
U.S. assessments echo Qassem's 
description. Hezbollah has a unified 
leadership structure that oversees the 
organization's complementary, partially 
compartmentalized elements, reads a 
Congressional Research Service report. 
The secretary-general, currently Nasrallah, 
presides over the Majlis al-Shura and 
functions as the group's leader under the 
authority of the jurist theologian 
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme 
leader. Five administrative bodies, 
organized around thematic responsibilities, 
run Hezbollah's political, military (jihad), 
parliamentary, executive, and judicial 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025065 
activities. The Majlis al-Shura considers all 
elements of the group's activities, including 
its political and military wings, as part of 
one holistic entity. 
According to Hezbollah's top officials, this 
unity of purpose among the group's diverse 
activities is essential to its success. If the 
military wing were separated from the 
political wing, this would have 
repercussions, and it would reflect on the 
political scene, Qassem told a Lebanese 
paper in 2000. Hezbollah's secretary-
general is the head of the Shura Council 
and also the head of the Jihad Council, and 
this means that we have one leadership, 
with one administration. 
The Jihad Council is the functional council 
underneath the Majlis al-Shura responsible 
for all military matters. Qassem writes that 
it comprises those in charge of resistance 
activity, be that in terms of oversight, 
recruitment, training, equipment, security, 
or any other resistance-related endeavors. 
To accomplish its mission, the council is 
divided into several smaller units in charge 
of protecting the leadership and carrying 
out internal and external surveillance, as 
well as overseas operations. The party's 
security branch is further broken down into 
three subgroups: central, preventive, and 
overseas security. In 2000, a dedicated 
counterintelligence branch was reportedly  
founded as well. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025066 
Under this structure, Hezbollah's militia 
and terrorist activities, along with its 
security organ, all report to the Jihad 
Council. Until he was killed, Mughniyeh 
was Hezbollah's top militant commander 
and reportedly led the Jihad Council 
himself By some accounts, he also held a 
seat on the Majlis al-Shura, which would 
be typical for the party's standing military 
commander. 
Unlike its sister councils, however, the 
Jihad Council enjoys strategic ambiguity. 
Neither the majority of Hezbollah officials 
nor the party's elected parliamentarians are 
aware of the details of their party's covert 
military and terrorist activities, which are 
decided on by the most senior leadership. 
According to the U.S. government, these 
activities are executed by the leadership 
of Hezbollah's military apparatus, known 
as the Islamic Resistance and led by 
Badreddine, and by the IJO, led by Talal 
Hamiyah, and they are overseen by 
Nasrallah. 
Europe's approach to Hezbollah has been 
varied. Many European governments have 
resisted international efforts to designate 
the organization as a terrorist group by 
distinguishing between Hezbollah's 
political and military wings. Britain 
distinguishes among Hezbollah's terrorist 
wing (the Islamic Jihad Organization), 
military wing, and political wing, and the 
country banned the IJO in 2000 and the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025067 
military wing in 2008. The Netherlands, 
however, designated Hezbollah a terrorist 
entity in 2004 without distinguishing 
between the group's political and military 
wings. A 2004 Dutch intelligence report 
highlighted investigations that show 
Hezbollah's political and terrorist wings 
are controlled by one co-ordinating 
council. 
The European Union has taken action 
against Hezbollah's interests in the past. In 
May 2002, the European Union froze the 
assets of a non-European terrorist group for 
the first time by adding seven Hezbollah-
affiliated individuals, including 
Mughniyeh, to its financial sanctions list 
for terrorism. It did not, however, sanction 
Hezbollah as an organization. On March 
10, 2005, the European Parliament passed a 
nonbinding resolution recognizing that 
clear evidence exists of terrorist activities 
on the part of Hezbollah and calling on the 
European Council to take all necessary 
steps to curtail them. 
But the necessary steps did not occur. 
Instead, most European countries preferred 
to make convenient distinctions between 
the different parts of Hezbollah, even when 
the group's own leadership does not. 
Today, as European leaders consider 
whether to label Hezbollah a terrorist 
group, they should judge the group by the 
totality of its actions. Hezbollah cannot be 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025068 
forgiven its criminal, terrorist, or militant 
pursuits simply because it also engages in 
political or humanitarian ones. As the 
Burgas bus bombing demonstrates, the 
Party of God can and has mobilized 
operatives for everything from criminal 
enterprises to terrorist attacks well beyond 
Lebanon's borders. 
And though Hezbollah is composed of 
multiple committees and branches, it 
operates as a single entity. Hezbollah, the 
U.S. intelligence community has 
determined, is a multifaceted, disciplined 
organization that combines political, social, 
paramilitary, and terrorist elements and is 
one in which decisions to resort to arms or 
terrorist tactics [are] carefully calibrated. 
Hezbollah's Qassem, speaking in October 
2012, concurred: We don't have a military 
wing and a political one; we don't have 
Hezbollah on one hand and the resistance 
party on the other.... Every element of 
Hezbollah, from commanders to members 
as well as our various capabilities, are in 
the service of the resistance, and we have 
nothing but the resistance as a priority, he 
said. 
Maybe it is time Western leaders finally 
listened to him.

A Middle-Class Paradise  
in Palestine?  
Armin Rosen 
Feb 11 2013 -- The sole outlet to Rawabi  
sits off a dizzying two-lane highway 
flanked by round, scraggly hills. In this part 
of the West Bank, just north of where the 
Jerusalem suburbs thin into a dry, granite-
gray wilderness, the mountains seem to aid 
in the illusion that Israeli and Palestinian 
spheres of authority can remain perfectly, 
even harmoniously separate. Arabs use the 
road to get to the Palestinian-controlled 
cities of Bir Zeit and Ramallah, for Jewish 
Israelis, the road connects the Jerusalem 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025070 
area to settlements deep inside the northern 
half of the West Bank. 
Ramallah's skyline is barely discernible on 
a hazy day. Ateret, a red-gabled settlement 
of about 90 families that sits high above the 
Rawabi junction -- a community which 
would likely either be vacated or 
incorporated into a Palestinian state under a 
future peace agreement -- flickers in and 
out of view with every delirious knot in the 
road. Even a concrete pillbox looming over 
the highest point along the highway is 
abandoned, its connection to the territory's 
oddly invisible occupying army marked 
only by a tattered Israeli flag that no one 
has bothered to steal or replace. 
Last year was the first since 1973 in which 
no Israeli citizen was killed in a terrorist 
attack originating from the West Bank. As 
on the newly-pacified Gaza-Israel border, a 
tense quiet pervades things here, although a 
bright red sign at the junction reminds one 
category of motorist not to feel too 
complacent. This road leads to Area 'A' 
Under the Palestinian Authority, it reads 
in Arabic, Hebrew, and broken English. 
The entrance for Israeli citizens is 
forbidden, dangerous to your lives and is 
against the Israeli law. At the Rawabi 
junction these warnings of latent danger are 
almost comically off-base, partly because 
of the only other marker at the turnoff: a 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025071 
light-green arrow sagging off of a nearby 
post. 
No one lives at the end of the road, which 
is every bit as wavy and disorienting as the 
adjoining highway. It empties into a scene 
that seems engineered for maximum 
bewilderment: three high-rise cranes, 
topped with fluttering Palestinian flags, 
tower over massive stone and concrete 
building frames. Cement-mixers, painted 
the same shade of light green as the arrow 
at the turnoff and marked with the project's 
logo -- a wiry oval with a cute little convex 
loop at the end, like a child's drawing of a 
heart that could also be a tree -- line up to 
receive material from a buzzing, state-of-
the-art plant. The construction site, a 
couple turns up-road of the cement factory, 
is swarming with workers in green 
hardhats. Spotless SUVs with the Rawabi 
logo on the door speed from one side of the 
site to another. 
Rawabi, which will be the first Palestinian 
planned city in the West Bank, runs from 
the top of the mountain to the valley below, 
with its highest point sitting at an elevation 
slightly higher than Ateret, which is now 
constantly visible. In contrast, the chaos of 
Ramallah, stronghold of an insolvent and 
sclerotic Palestinian Authority, feels distant 
in more senses than one. 
Rawabi represents something totally new --
a visionary Palestinian-directed private 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025072 
sector project, with support from both 
Israeli businesses and a major Arab 
government. It has the potential to shift the 
conversation on the region's future on both 
sides of the Green Line. It could convince 
Palestinians -- and the rest of the world --
that the future of the West Bank shouldn't 
be shackled to Ramallah or Jerusalem's 
vacillating willingness to hash out 
fundamental issues. It could prove that 
there's an appetite, both among Palestinian 
consumers and foreign donors, for the 
creation of a social and economic existence 
in the West Bank that's de-coupled, 
insomuch as currently possible, from the 
Middle East's tense and labyrinthine 
politics. 
It would also help solidify the benefits of 
the current cessation in hostilities. Indeed, 
Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas's 
progress in fostering the end of violent 
resistance in the West Bank in the years 
after the bloody Second Intifada, coupled 
with Palestinian Prime Minister Salaam 
Fayyad's widely-respected institution-
building initiative, could get a crucial 
private sector assist through Rawabi's 
eventual success. 
And Rawabi gets at something even more 
fundamental. It touches upon all of the 
core issues of control and sovereignty, 
says Robert Danin, a fellow at the Council 
on Foreign Relations who, as head of the 
Quartet mission in Jerusalem from 2008 to 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025073 
2010, witnessed some of the political 
discussions that accompanied the project's 
creation. This could be a huge, iconic 
victory for the whole strategy of building 
Palestine from the bottom up rather than 
trying to build it at the negotiating table, 
he says. 
Its success would prove just how much 
power Palestinians can, and indeed already 
do, have in shaping their future. And its 
failure could prove the exact opposite. 
I visited Rawabi two weeks ago with a 
group of national security professionals, as 
part of a trip organized by the Foundation 
for Defense of Democracies, a Washington, 
DC-based think tank. (All of the photos in 
the body of the article are mine.) We were 
taken around the construction site by a 
young Palestinian engineer who conveyed 
the vast ambition underlying the project: 
When the city is completed, she said, it will 
house 45,000 people in 23 distinct 
neighborhoods with innocuous, nature-
based names like Flint, and Hard Rock. 
(Rawabi is Arabic for Hills.) There will 
be eight schools -- some of them built with 
the help of the U.S. Agency for 
International Development -- a huge 
park, a convention center, an 850-seat 
indoor theater, and a 20,000-seat 
amphitheater carved into a hillside. 
Most ambitiously, there will be a 
commercial center that developers hope 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025074 
will bring in between 3,000 and 5,000 
permanent jobs within the next five years --
hopefully, we were told, in the 
informational technology sector (an 
aspiration that might imply a certain 
cooperation with the burgeoning tech 
industry on the other side of the Green 
Line). The engineer said that Rawabi had 
already created 3,000 construction jobs for 
West Bank Palestinians. The city is 
Palestinian-designed and Palestinian-built - 
- making the surfeit of Qatari flags at the 
construction site somewhat puzzling at 
first. And while the project does not 
purchase materials from Jewish settlements 
in the West Bank, the engineer was hardly 
shy in explaining that Rawabi would add 
an estimated $85 million to the Israeli 
economy. 
As we drove around the construction site, 
the engineer's talk made few demands on 
the imagination. The sheer scale of the 
project is already obvious. Within the next 
18 months, the first phase, which includes 
six neighborhoods, a mosque, the 
amphitheater, and two-thirds of the city's 
commercial center, will be complete, and 
3,000 people are scheduled will move into 
Rawabi by the end of 2013. Apartment 
blocks built of a local white stone --
Rawabi stone, the engineer called it -- are 
already rising out of a network of 
concentric ring-roads centered on the top of 
the hill. Most of these roads have already 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025075 
been paved, and there are terraced retaining 
walls, built out of thick stacks of local 
sandstone, running all the way to the 
bottom of the valley. No bleachers have 
been installed in the amphitheater yet, but 
it's fairly far along, with the future seating 
area fanning into a wide notch in the 
mountainside. There are attractive stone 
signs bearing the stylized Arabic names of 
neighborhoods that haven't been built yet. 
The future commercial center is also well 
on its way to completion. Situated on a 
shelf slightly below the summit of the hill, 
the complex of office buildings, hotels, 
theaters, and a convention center will 
huddle around a broad outdoor plaza, 
which will be connected to the lower 
neighborhoods through a wide flight of 
stairs. The stairs, plaza, and central 
buildings are already past their skeletal 
phase, and the high-rise apartments ringing 
the city center look like they're almost 
complete. For now, the commercial core is 
a jumble of dust and brutal concrete 
surfaces, but in the future, someone 
lingering in the cafés near the staircase will 
enjoy phenomenal views of the rugged hill 
country, and perhaps even glimpses of the 
Jordan River Valley on a clear day. 
It is still possible to remain unconvinced of 
Rawabi's reality -- doubtful as to whether 
that café will ever be built, or whether any 
middle class-Palestinian desirous of a 
generic middle class existence will ever 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025076 
linger there. There's abundant reason for 
skepticism. The project's future depends on 
the Israeli authorities' willingness to allow 
for the construction of access roads in 
Area C, or West Bank territory under the 
direct control of Israel. The sole existing 
route into the city only exists because the 
Israeli government, after years of 
bureaucratic and high-level diplomatic 
wrangling, granted Rawabi's developers a 
permit for a temporary road. Technically, 
they will have to destroy the road when the 
current permission expires. And even if the 
Israelis agree to make the road permanent, 
one two-lane route is hardly adequate for a 
city of 45,000 people. Developers claim it 
isn't even adequate to the needs of the 
current construction site. 
Water is another challenge. Negotiations 
with Israel and the Palestinian Water 
Authority are ongoing, and developers say 
they have held in excess of 100 meetings 
with Israeli officials on water-related issues 
alone. Developers admit that they aren't 
sure where the city's water resources will 
eventually come from, and the construction 
site only got running water two months 
ago. 
And they'll admit that attracting jobs to the 
site is an even bigger challenge than Israel's 
West Bank regime. Rawabi isn't meant to 
be a bedroom community of Ramallah. It's 
meant to be a self-contained city, with 
office and retail space. The jobs haven't 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025077 
quite materialized yet (although the 
developers have a slight head start: 
between 200 and 300 call center-type jobs 
currently based in Ramallah are scheduled 
to move into Rawabi when the first phase 
of construction is complete). If the political 
or security situation seriously deteriorates - 
- if the checkpoints return, if the Israelis are 
forced to re-occupy urban areas ceded to 
the Palestinian Authority under the Oslo 
Accords, as happened during the Second 
Intifada; if Hamas wages a violent takeover 
of the Palestinian government -- all bets are 
off The developers don't seem to be 
bothered by those possibilities right now. 
At the showroom, built at the very top of 
the hill, the future is nothing but bright. 
I chatted with another site engineer as we 
walked through a scale-model mock-up of 
a typical Rawabian street, where happy 
families in western dress waved from little 
video screens inset in plastic apartment 
windows. I asked her about the Qatari flags 
I had seen around the construction site. 
Qatar's state investment fund is footing two 
thirds of the nearly $1 billion project bill, 
she said. This is the biggest investment in 
the history of Palestine, she explained as 
we stepped over a fake valley in the next 
room, walking past a mock-up of a 
stunning hilltop view contained inside a 
mock-up of a future apartment suite. The 
Rawabians will apparently own large flat-
screen TVs and stylish coffee tables, and 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025078 
their living spaces will be kept mercilessly 
clean. 
What, of that $1 billion investment, was 
going to Israel, I asked? Israeli companies 
were providing cement powder and sand, 
she said, and the project had consulted with 
Israeli experts. In some cases, you have 
to do that, she said, alluding to the 
comparative difficulty of importing 
building materials through neighboring 
Jordan. In other words, working with the 
Israelis was a necessary business decision 
for a project this large and complex. 
The fake street, fake valley, fake 
apartment-display ended in a pleasant sky-
lit lobby, where representatives of the 
Cairo Amman Bank, Arab Islamic Bank, 
and Arab Bank sat in logoed glass cubicles, 
available to discuss financing for future 
purchases. And for the still-skeptical, 
there's a six-minute 3-D movie, where the 
city appears in its completed glory -- a 
place where families picnic, men in 
business dress greet each other amid 
bustling plazas, and fireworks crest over 
soaring apartment towers topped with solar 
panels. The architecture is tasteful. These 
aren't dachas plunked on fake islands off 
the coast of Dubai. It's the kind of place 
where I, or just about anyone in the world 
with middle or even upper-middle class 
aspirations, would want to live. And it 
looked weirdly familiar. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025079 
The group had a chance to visit with 
Bashar Masri, the Nablus-born founder and 
CEO of Massar International, the 
Palestinian conglomerate financing a third 
of Rawabi. Massar and Qatar Diar, the real 
estate investment arm of the government of 
Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, jointly 
created Bayti Real Estate Investment 
Company -- Palestine to build and market 
Rawabi. But if two-thirds of the project's 
money is coming from Qatar, the vision 
behind Rawabi is Masri's. 
Massar owns a private equity fund that 
invests in Palestinian agriculture and 
natural gas distribution. It runs travel 
agencies in Jordan and brokerage firms in 
Serbia. Massar invests in Harvest Export, 
which sells Palestinian produce to 
consumers in Russia and Western Europe --
as well as in Israel. Two years ago, Masri 
made headlines when he attempted to  
purchase a bankrupt Jewish housing 
development in East Jerusalem. He helped 
create an online trading and brokerage 
platform for Palestine's stock exchange. 
Masri has lived outside of Palestine for 
periods of his life, and is, by all accounts, 
largely untainted by connections to the 
PA's notoriously rent-seeking inner circle. 
He's a trim middle-aged man, smartly-
dressed, friendly and approachable. There 
seemed no more appropriate a place to talk 
to him one-on-one than on a wide terrace 
overlooking the construction site, with 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025080 
hills, valleys, and rising apartment blocks --
the future he was in the process of building 
-- stretched out in front of him. 
On a good, clear day, you can see Tel 
Aviv, Ashdod, and Ashkelon, he told me. 
One-third of Palestine and Israel. Rawabi 
is in the second-largest, yet most sparsely-
populated Area A in the West Bank -- from 
the terrace, which faces away from Ateret, 
you can see expanses of mostly-empty 
hills. Perhaps in Masri's mind, they are 
awaiting Rawabis of their own. When I 
returned to Washington, I asked him in a 
phone interview if he viewed his project as 
the first of many such planned cities in 
Palestine. I always say our success is 
measured not by how many homes we sell. 
It is measured when a second Rawabi is 
established, he told me. 
Standing on the terrace, I asked him if his 
willingness to undertake such a massive 
project reflected any optimism about the 
coming years -- no one invests this much 
time, money, and energy into something if 
they expect war is on the horizon. This 
project is built for today's politics, he 
replied. If it gets a little worse, or a little 
better -- fine. If it gets really bad, we're in 
trouble. If it doesn't, then great. We're not 
waiting on a breakthrough. 
He estimated that Israeli obstruction had 
delayed the project by a year and a half 
The bureaucratic inertia could continue: 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025081 
For instance, developers were surprised to 
find out that, by a quirk in the West Bank's 
notoriously Byzantine and palimpsestic 
legal codes, they required the approval of a 
joint Israeli-Palestinian water commission 
created through the Oslo Accords to build a 
sewage treatment plant in an Area A, 
approval that they recently received. 
There's also the still-unresolved matter of 
the access road. But thus far, Rawabi had 
flourished in spite of delays and 
inconveniences. 
Could it survive its isolation, though --
could this hilltop off of a two-lane highway 
get enough water and electricity to support 
45,000 people living at a middle class 
standard? There is nothing here at all. 
We're out in the boondocks, he conceded. 
We're building everything from scratch. 
One needed only to glance at the busy 
construction site below to understand that 
Masri considers this a point of pride, far 
from a potential death-sentence for his 
project. 
I asked Masri about something that had 
jumped out at me during the 3-D video. 
The finished Rawabi, I'd noted, had the 
same terraced garden parks, stoic, modular 
apartment design, and concentric hilltop 
roads that I had seen in Talpiyot Misrach, a 
new neighborhood on the fringes of West 
Jerusalem. His city looked very, well, 
Israeli. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025082 
This place is influenced by Reston, 
Virginia, he said -- Masri is a Virginia 
Tech alumnus, and had lived in the 
Washington, DC area earlier in life. It was, 
he said, influenced by planned suburbs 
outside of Cairo. And it's influenced by 
Modi'in, he added, explaining that the 
site's engineers and designers (who were 
entirely Palestinian, we had been told 
earlier), had traveled to the Israeli city, 
which is built around similar topography, 
for inspiration. 
Palestinians have long understood that a 
western-style standard of living was 
possible in their part of the world. They 
knew that places like Rawabi already 
existed minutes from their own homes, but 
didn't think that the quality of life 
epitomized by hilltop settlements and cities 
in Israel -- places they weren't allowed to 
visit without an official permit from the 
military -- was accessible to them. 
During our phone interview, Masri talked 
about the astonishment that Palestinians 
feel when they visit the construction site. 
When [Palestinians] come to Rawabi, and 
they go through the showroom and they see 
what we have planned for them, and they 
see it actually being built, they say, 'Wow, 
this can't be for us. This is not for us. This 
is too high of a standard for us because we 
are supposed to live miserably under the 
occupation'. Then they come to the other 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025083 
side of the showroom and see the city being 
built, and reality starts sinking in. 
It's a type of living closely associated with 
the Palestinians' neighbors in Israel. They 
know very well that just a 20-minute drive 
away, there's a community with a much 
higher standard of living. And that 
community happened to be one 
representing the occupier, quote-unquote 
the 'enemy.' But they would love to live 
like that. And that's why when they come 
to Rawabi some of them don't believe this 
is for them initially. The first thing that 
goes through their mind is that this could 
be for the Israelis. 
But it is for them. Rawabi's significance 
could lie in something more mundane than 
basic issues of sovereignty and control in 
the West Bank. It lies in the common, 
human desire -- powerful on either side of 
the Green Line -- for a comfortable and 
dignified existence. 
In some quarters, this idea of working 
within the present and less-than-ideal 
political and economic framework to 
achieve this goal is nothing short of 
inflammatory. The U.S.-based, anti-peace 
process website Electronic Intifada has 
smeared Masri as an Israeli collaborator, 
and there have been scattered accusations 
that the project actually legitimizes Israeli 
control over the West Bank. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025084 
Danin says that Masri is faced with a 
difficult balancing act. On the one hand 
you're denying the occupation, and you're 
saying you do not accept its legitimacy, he 
says. But that doesn't mean you won't 
work with Israel in order to improve the 
Palestinian situation with the goal of 
removing the occupation. That's a difficult 
message to convey successfully. 
Masri rejects the notion that he abetting a 
problematic status quo. The vast majority 
of Palestinians understand and know 
reality, he said. There is no home in 
Palestine without Israeli cement and parts. 
Every construction project in Palestine 
must have components from Israel. So it's 
not like I'm doing something different. 
Of course, he doesn't like that Israel has so 
much control over Palestinian imports, and 
the West Bank economy in general. This 
is the occupation, he said. I'm not happy 
about that and that's why we strive for a 
state of our own. But he likened 
boycotting Israeli products to boycotting 
products from the United Kingdom, the 
United States, or other countries supportive 
of Israel -- something he wouldn't consider. 
The only people he won't buy from are the 
West Bank settlers. 
Luckily, Masri's vision has the backing of a 
powerful regional government -- one that 
does not officially recognize Israel, and 
whose actions have often had the effect of 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025085 
strengthening some of the Jewish State's 
sworn enemies. 
The Gulf kingdom of Qatar has done more 
than simply buy into the Rawabi paradigm: 
It's also funding two-thirds of the project, 
to the tune of over $600 million. This is 
enough money to single-handedly finance 
the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority 
-- which is effectively broke, thanks to 
penalties imposed by the Israeli and U.S. 
governments after Mahmoud Abbas's 
successful push for a U.N. General 
Assembly vote on Palestinian U.N. 
membership, and a freeze in financial aid 
from Gulf State donors, most notably Saudi 
Arabia -- for the better part of a year. 
Instead, the Qataris have not only bypassed 
the PA, but channeled money into a project 
that seems to prove the PA's uselessness. 
It's like an island inside the traditional 
infrastructure of the PA, says Jonathan 
Schanzer, vice president of research at the 
Foundation for Defense of Democracies 
and author of a book on Palestinian internal 
politics. It shows everyone what you can 
do if you don't go through the PA. The PA 
receives $600 million a year [in foreign 
aid] and they have not done something like 
this. 
Masri says that the leadership of the PA has 
been fully supportive, but that Rawabi has 
been hurt by the Palestinian government's 
lack of capacity. We should not be 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025086 
building public schools. We should not be 
building a waste water treatment plant or 
waste water networks or water reservoirs, 
he told me. Unfortunately we have to do 
that because the Palestinian Authority does 
not have the funding and the donors let [the 
PA] down. 
There might be a political calculation 
behind Qatar's decision to throw an amount 
of money equivalent to two years of U.S.  
financial aid to the PA behind a single 
private-sector figure like Masri. Qatar 
recently announced plans to invest nearly  
$400 million in the Hamas-controlled Gaza 
Strip, and in October of 2012, Qatari Emir 
Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani 
became the first head of state to visit the  
Strip  after the Islamist militant group's 
2007 takeover. Hamas politburo chief 
Khaled Meshaal lives in Doha, and Qatar 
Diar is financing a major development in  
Sudan, whose cash-strapped government 
enjoys close relations with Iran, and has 
facilitated the transfer of long-range 
rockets to Hamas. In short, Qatar supports 
an E.U. and U.S. listed terrorist 
organization bitterly opposed to both Israel 
and the current PA leadership. And it also 
has no problem investing in Rawabi. 
According to Kamran Bokhari, vice 
president of Middle Eastern and South 
Asian affairs for Stratfor, Qatari support for 
Hamas is part of the sheikhdom's larger, 
post-Arab Spring strategy of siding with 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025087 
the Middle East's Islamists, and specifically 
the Muslim brotherhood, whom the Qataris 
view as the region's rising power. The 
Qatari strategy is that the situation has 
changed, and we need to fend for ourselves 
and ensure that the regional anarchy is not 
going to impact us, says Bokhari. The 
Qatari investment in Rawabi -- which feeds 
an $85 million investment in the Israeli 
economy, and which could not have 
happened without some degree of official 
Israeli approval -- is an example of this 
larger geopolitical strategy, which is driven 
more by perceived self-interest than by an 
ideological affinity for political Islam. 
Investments in the region are about the 
return on political influence, adds Gregory 
Gause, a professor at the University of 
Vermont and a non-resident senior fellow 
at the Brookings Institution-Doha. He 
noted the presence of a large American 
airbase in Qatar, and the country's close 
relations with the United States. 
In the Palestinian territories, as in the 
broader region, the Qataris are supporting 
secular and religious forces in a way that 
will maximize their influence and keep the 
regional balance as favorable for them as 
possible. In a sense, the same strategic 
calculus that convinces Qatar to support 
Hamas allows them to cooperate with Israel 
and the West Bank private sector as well. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025088 
I think Qatar is going by the ground 
reality, says Bokhari. Fatah, the ruling 
faction of the PA, is essentially tanking. It's 
really in a state of decline because of 
corruption and charges of embezzlement. 
It's got an aging leadership. There's no 
dynamism left in the group. There's a lot of 
factionalism. It's almost like an oligarchy. 
Rawabi could be Qatar's way of 
encouraging the currently-calm status quo 
in the West Bank, but without obviously 
upgrading their ties to Israel, or throwing 
their money behind a political 
establishment that they don't fully trust. 
On one end they need to make sure Fatah 
does not completely collapse or weaken to 
the point where they're no longer coherent, 
says Bokhari, and Hamas needs to be 
shaped and contained and shepherded in a 
way that it doesn't grow into anything 
larger. 
Though there are politics underlying 
Qatar's investment in Rawabi, it is still, 
inevitably, a financial decision. You have 
serious people who have a lot at risk here, 
Danin says. Their goal is not primarily to 
make a political point. Their goal is to 
recoup their investment and make some 
money. Even resource-rich Qatar, which 
wants to diversity its holdings in order to 
hedge against long-term shifts in the oil 
and natural gas market, cares whether its 
investment choices pay off 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025089 
Danin believes that Rawabi's Palestinian 
and Qatari investors made a wise decision. 
Housing in Ramallah is expensive, and 
Danin says that there is a sizable and 
highly-educated Palestinian middle class in 
need of an alternative to the West Bank's 
de-facto capital. He expressed little doubt 
when I asked him if the West Bank 
economy could support Rawabi. This is a 
Palestinian national project, he said. It is 
the best of what is possible in that it's 
private sector-led, and it's profit-making 
led. 
And it has supporters in high places. When 
President Barack Obama met with Israeli 
officials in Washington in September of 
2010, Rawabi was on the agenda. 
From one perspective, Rawabi is a historic 
investment in Palestine, as well as an 
unusually open point of cooperation 
between Israel and an Arab government. It 
could improve the lives of Palestinians, 
while convincing Israelis that they have 
nothing to fear from their neighbors' 
prosperity. But any attempts to change 
the status quo in the West Bank are fraught 
with difficulties. 
There's Israeli bureaucracy to overcome. 
In Israel, if the Minister of Defense says I 
want something, it's not that the system 
thwarts it. But the system is so 
decentralized that ultimately it takes a lot 
of steps to get it translated into action, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025090 
says Danin. Israeli officials are positively 
disposed towards Rawabi, but it's still taken 
years to resolve sovereignty and 
governance issues around necessities like 
water, and a single access road. Such 
Israeli inertia was apparently at the heart of 
Obama's concerns back in 2010, and 
sources say that the president has discussed 
the issue of the access road with Israeli 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on 
multiple occasions. 
Back in Washington, I asked Masri if he 
believed the Israelis understood the 
potential importance of Rawabi. I really 
don't know, he said. Their statements are 
neutral to positive. But their actions are 
neutral to negative. 
And then there's the larger inertia. What 
meaning does a place like Rawabi have if it 
sits in the middle of a still-unresolved 
conflict, or if Palestinian economic self-
improvement stands in contrast to an all-
pervading political stasis -- or even 
political backsliding? Today, Rawabi is 
significant because of its novelty. But if 
there's a breakthrough in the Israeli-
Palestinian peace process, perhaps enabled 
by a growing West Bank economy and a 
permanent end in terrorism, it could take on 
an importance much larger than itself 
On the drive out of the valley, where the 
highway swerves past the pillbox with the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025091 
beaten Israeli flag and past the turnoff for 
Ateret, the picture is still mixed.

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022536.txt,"Additional Principles of Criminal
Liability for Anti-Bribery Violations:
Aiding and Abetting and Conspiracy

Under federal law, individuals or companies that aid
or abet acrime, including an FCPA violation, are as guilty as
if they had directly committed the offense themselves. The
aiding and abetting statute provides that whoever “commits
an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels,
commands, induces or procures its commission,” or “will-
fully causes an act to be done which if directly performed
by him or another would be an offense against the United
States,’ is punishable as a principal.'” Aiding and abetting is
not an independent crime, and the government must prove
that an underlying FCPA violation was committed.*”

Individuals and companies, including foreign nation-
als and companies, may also be liable for conspiring to
violate the FCPA—i.e., for agreeing to commit an FCPA
violation—even if they are not, or could not be, indepen-
dently charged with a substantive FCPA violation. For
instance, a foreign, non-issuer company could be convicted
of conspiring with a domestic concern to violate the FCPA.
Under certain circumstances, it could also be held liable
for the domestic concern’s substantive FCPA violations
under Pinkerton v. United States, which imposes liability on
a defendant for reasonably foreseeable crimes committed
by a co-conspirator in furtherance of a conspiracy that the
defendant joined.”

A foreign company or individual may be held liable
for aiding and abetting an FCPA violation or for conspiring
to violate the FCPA, even if the foreign company or indi-
vidual did not take any act in furtherance of the corrupt
payment while in the territory of the United States. In con-
spiracy cases, the United States generally has jurisdiction
over all the conspirators where at least one conspirator is
an issuer, domestic concern, or commits a reasonably fore-
seeable overt act within the United States.” For example,
if a foreign company or individual conspires to violate the
FCPA with someone who commits an overt act within the
United States, the United States can prosecute the foreign
company or individual for the conspiracy. The same prin-

ciple applies to aiding and abetting violations. For instance,

The FCPA:

Anti-Bribery Provisions

even though they took no action in the United States,
Japanese and European companies were charged with con-
spiring with and aiding and abetting a domestic concern’s

ECPA violations.?”

Additional Principles of Civil Liability
for Anti-Bribery Violations: Aiding and
Abetting and Causing

Both companies and individuals can be held civilly
liable for aiding and abetting FCPA anti-bribery violations
if they knowingly or recklessly provide substantial assis-
tance to a violator.™ Similarly, in the administrative pro-
ceeding context, companies and individuals may be held
liable for causing FCPA violations.” This liability extends
to the subsidiaries and agents of US. issuers.

In one case, the U.S. subsidiary of a Swiss freight for-
warding company was held civilly liable for paying bribes on
behalf of its customers in several countries.” Although the
US. subsidiary was not an issuer for purposes of the FCPA,
it was an “agent” of several US. issuers. By paying bribes on
behalf of its issuers’ customers, the subsidiary both directly

violated and aided and abetted the issuers’ FCPA violations.

What Is the Applicable Statute of
Limitations?

Statute of Limitations in Criminal Cases

The FCPA’s anti-bribery and accounting provisions
do not specify a statute of limitations for criminal actions.
Accordingly, the general five-year limitations period set
forth in 18 US.C. § 3282 applies to substantive criminal
violations of the Act.?”
In cases involving FCPA conspiracies, the govern-

ment may be able to reach conduct occurring before the

five-year limitations period applicable to conspiracies

country.”

But if Washington remains committed to
ever-tougher sanctions — and without
promising Iran that sanctions will be
lifted as part of a deal — then negotiations
are unlikely to succeed. Vali Nasr,
another former Obama administration
official with expertise on Iran, suggested
recently that there's not much more the
world can do to sanction Iran, and that
such penalties could drive Tehran to take
radical action. The regime of sanctions
against Iran over its nuclear activity
really has reached its end, Nasr, dean of
the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced
International Studies at Johns Hopkins
University, said during the World
Economic Forum in Davos. And he
warned that unless there is a diplomatic
breakthrough — or, alternatively, an
attack on Iran — you really are looking
at a scenario where Iran is going to rush
very quickly towards nuclear power,
because they also think, like North
Korea, that (then) you have much more
leverage to get rid of these sanctions.”

Robert Dreyfuss is an independent,
investigative journalist in the
Washington, D.C, area, who writes
frequently for The Nation, Rolling Stone,
and other publications. His blog, The

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029822
"
IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019345.txt,"used data stolen from Facebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald
Trump emerged victor. It is not a mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right
from East to West. And he has already met, among others, the Hungarian Orban, the French Marine
Le Pen and the former leader of the British separatists Nigel Farage. The latter reappeared,
coincidentally, on Friday in Pennsylvania, USA, to a fundraiser in favor of the Republican
congressman Lou Barletta. Without forgetting the Italians of Lega and 5 stars. Of them, he said: If
it works in Italy, we can import the model anywhere”.

The Movement, which for now will count on a staff of 10 people, will be fully operational in 2019.
In short, after the American midterm elections, where Bannon is fighting to influence the primaries
supporting candidates potentially able to undermine the prospects of Republican establishment. But
in the future the former spin doctor says he wants to spend more and more time in Europe. Also
because the relationships with Trump have worsened after the revelations he made to Michael
Wolff and published in the scandal book “Fire and Fury”. “Better to reign in Hell than to serve in
Paradise,” Bannon says now paraphrasing the Satan of one of his favorite books, John Milton's Lost
Paradise. Hell in this case would be the dear old Europe and its democratic values. The “army of
darkness” is already among us.

Edwards' Opposition to Epstein's Motion for Summary Judgment
Page 5 of 15

Federal Statute providing for compensation to victims of child abuse.. (Exhibit “A” — Edwards’
Statement of Undisputed Material Facts, paragraphs 41-43).

On July 6, 2010 Epstein ultimately paid to settle all three of the cases Edwards had filed against
him (Exhibit “A” — Edwards’ Statement of Undisputed Material Facts, paragraphs 84-85). At Epstein’s
request, the terms of the settlement were kept confidential. The sum that he paid to settle all these cases
in therefore not filed with this pleading and will be provided to the court for in camera review. Epstein
chose to make this payment as a result of a Federal Court ordered mediation process which he himself
sought. Epstein entered into the settlements in July 2010 more than seven months after he filed his
lawsuit against Edwards and before he filed his Second Amended Complaint alleging abuse of process on

Further, Epstein could not have been the victim of any scheme to pump the cases against him
because he never paid to settle the cases until well after Edwards had left RRA and severed all connection
with Rothstein in December 2009 (Edwards’ Affidavit attached to Statement of Undisputed Facts as
Exhibit “N,” paragraph 20). Moreover, Epstein could not have suffered any damage as a result of the
perpetration of the Ponzi scheme by Rothstein because he was not an investor in the scheme.

Perhaps the most significant evidence presented in opposition to Epstein’s Motion for Summary
Judgment is the telephone interview of Virginia Roberts submitted in Support of Edwards’ Motion for
Punitive Damages (Exhibit “D”). In addition to the specious claims against Edwards relating to his
alleged involvement in a Ponzi scheme, Epstein, in asserting his claims, primarily relied upon the pursuit
by Edwards of testimony from his close friends and associates (See Second Amended Complaint,
paragraph 32, pp. 11-13). Reliance on these assertions is also threaded through Epstein’s Motion for
Summary Judgment in his citation to the public documents referencing the pursuit of such discovery. But
as set forth in detail in Edwards’ Motion for Final Summary Judgment (Exhibit “B”) at pages 14-16, that

discovery was entirely appropriate and Epstein knew it. Specifically, as reflected in the statement of

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014467.txt,"Rotation - more to go but it has to be more gradual

On the basis of our central forecasts for growth, inflation and rates and given the moves
in the market already we think that the pace of the rotation has to moderate. After all if
we are to see another 30-40 bp of yield increase in the US between now and H2 2017
having already seen more than 90bp since the summer, it has to slow.

That view combined with the readings from our models lay behind our recent
downgrades of banks and miners. That is not to say that the rotation is finished. If bond
yields truly have turned than some of the more expensive defensives likely have to de-
rate further. The bull market in those stocks has simply lasted too long for that not to be
the case.

In addition while there have been significant moves in positioning in terms of cutting
underweights in areas like Banks and Basic Resources and hedge fund positioning has
probably moved faster still, we do not believe that positioning has completely turned
around. Looking at both the Fund Manager Survey and our own internal data we think
there are still legacy underweights in cyclical areas and legacy overweights in
defensives, particularly quality defensives. That argues for another leg in the rotation
trade.

Nevertheless, it suggests to us that a more balanced approach is justified right now. We
are still overweight oil, but little else in the cyclical space, so today we add Media. We
are still underweight Food & Beverage but against that we are overweight Healthcare
and Utilities.

Relief or revolt - Eurozone politics in focus in 2017

We think it likely investors will demand a higher risk premium until the French Elections
in May 2017 given the likelihood that Marine Le Pen will make to the second round of
voting (according to polls). A Le Pen victory could likely bring the future of the EU and
the Euro into question as she has talked about France withdrawing from both. That in
turn has arguably the potential to be even more of an earthquake for the world’s
financial markets. Our central case is that centre right President is elected in France
(with Francois Fillon now the official Republican candidate) and Merkel is returned at the
head of a coalition government in Germany now that she has indicated she will stand for
re-election. Until the French vote though we suspect investors will be cautious about
European markets. Were this to be the case then we think there may well be room for a
significant relief rally in European assets. We have more on this, including a calendar, in
our section on Eurozone politics.

Decent valuations but not compelling

Headline PE multiples do not screen as particularly cheap for European equities but are
also not excessively expensive. In fact the current forward PE on MSCI Europe at 14.1x
is right in-line with the average since 1987. The most recent high in PE multiples was
over 16.5x at the April 2015 market highs. However, more recently the market has
traded in a fairly tight range around 14-15.5x PE, with some fleeting falls to 13x around
the market lows in February 2016 and at the time of the Brexit referendum. At the
current multiple we see valuations as quite reasonable therefore. Our index target
assumes some multiple expansion back to 15x, which we think is quite achievable under
our base case assumptions.

Topix (27 June): 745 (last month: 721)
UBS View Topix (6-month target): 780
¢ We expect earnings growth of about 45% over the coming 12 months. This exceptional high growth is
mainly due to the two natural disasters last year, as well as tax regulation changes which caused a
number of one-time losses to be booked in the fiscal year that ended in March 2012.
e In our base case scenario, we see only limited scope for an additional earnings boost from the local
economic recovery, given the slowing in export markets. Japanese companies are expected to continue
their cost reduction efforts to counter the impact of a strong yen.
¢ The Japanese government has started implementing its JPY 18tn recovery budget in 4Q 2011, and we
expect the budget to boost Japanese GDP by 1-1.5% in FY2012.
e Mainly due to the earnings rebound, we expect the TOPIX trailing P/E to drop from around 16.5x to 14x
— 14.5x by year end; still the earnings rebound should provide some room for moderate price increases.

4 Positive scenario Topix (6-month target): 900
¢ Stronger global demand and stabilizing European markets provide an additional boost to earnings, and
also lead to improved risk taking. Falling risk aversion is likely to lead to a weaker yen, providing further
upside to earnings. TOPIX target is based on 16.0x trailing P/E.

& Negative scenario Topix (6-month target): 600
¢ Faltering global growth leads to weak exports, triggering negative earnings surprises. A strengthening
USDJPY below 75 in response to rising risk aversion might provide an additional drag on the economy and
earnings. We would then expect the P/E ratio to contract to 13.5x, even if earnings show no recovery.

Note: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)

What we're watching Why it matters

JPY and exports The exchange rate is an important factor for the Japanese equity market, and
central bank intervention is a key swing factor. Japan’s trade balance could be in
deficit and may impact USDJPY rates. Key date: 09 July, Japanese trade

balance

BoJ’s monetary policy

The Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) additional commitment to its asset purchase program,
board meeting

which is currently JPY 65tn in size, would lead to a weaker yen, in our view. Key
date: 12 July, BoJ policy meeting

For further information please contact ClO asset class specialist Toru Ibayashi, toru.ibayashi@ubs.com

Preference: neutral

Recommendations

Tactical (6 months)

e The earthquake in Japan and recent
floods in Thailand have impacted
Japanese earnings negatively. A recovery
from these disasters should benefit auto
and industrial stocks in particular.

e We prefer companies that continue cost
reduction initiatives to maintain price
competitiveness during the period of yen
strength.

Strategic (1 to 2 years)

e A weaker USDJPY may drive Japanese
companies’ earnings recovery beyond a
technical recovery from natural disasters.

e Arapidly aging population and the lack
of a powerful and stable government
remain negative for the country's longer-
term economic prospects.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018412.txt,"before such a fork appears. This approach, too, has its logical problems. Boxing the
largest economy in the world hardly seems sensible - and is likely not achievable.
Anyhow, early attempts to do so have shown how little leverage the US has. When
China announced plans to build an Asian Investment and Infrastructure Bank in
2014, the US opposed it and then watched as nearly all of Washington’s traditional
allies raced to join.

At the same time, China’s policy towards the US has been hard to decipher for many:
Is the country intent on amity or enmity? It’s clear enough that the American
options presented to Beijing are unappetizing: Change or be contained. Messages by
China in response have tickled the natural historical pessimism of American political
leaders. China speaks of wanting a new kind of relations with America, of cultivating
rich technological and financial ties, but the country at the same moment challenges
easy assumptions about how foreign investment, educational or security
cooperation might mesh together like gears of friendly progress. It’s hard to do
business in the Mainland. The military grows with astonishing speed. Domestic
habits of smash-mouth competition rattle at more sedate Western habits. Any
element of China’s actions are explainable and even sensible when seen with
sympathetic eyes — but the same exact facts can be stitched into a story that suggests
constant damage to American interests. China’s position is, to be honest, a difficult
one: The country is opaque to most foreigners, wrapped in habits and instincts that
run along such different lines that even simple daily decisions - how to runa
meeting, for example - can be a source of disagreement. Jn the west you prize
diamonds for their clarity, Chinese will say, in China we prize jade because it is cloudy.
There’s a charm in opacity; even a bit of sensible political magic at times. But China
is moving out into the world very rapidly, now: Fast and dimly understood don’t
fuse into easy trust.

In one sense, then, it’s possible to sense the tense, angry energy of an impending
collision. Beijing and Washington are enacting the old historical pattern. Wrestling
for years over small issues, never quite coming to grips, slowly pulling at each other
until a final, fatal collapse. Germany and Great Britain, all over again. But: Connection
changes the nature of an object. So much in our world looks different after connected
dynamics are applied. Might connection change the nature of enmity? We are, after
all, part of the same connected skein. We've concluded that America’s greatest
threat is not China or Russia or terrorism - but the evolution of the network itself.
That same topological evolution menaces Beijing too. If China is not our biggest
enemy, if we are not theirs - what might be developed? Might the rat trap of history
remain unsprung?

An American “China Policy” shouldn’t be regarded as some distinct initiative; rather
it must be a part of a grand strategic program of Hard Gatekeeping. Our goal aim
isn’t some shimmeringly perfect “China Policy” so much as it is to cultivate a grand
strategic disposition that informs what we undertake in cyber, Russia, the Middle
East, and China. Imagine we had a terrific “China policy” and a backfiring “Nuclear
weapons policy”? Masterful grand strategy is marked by a comprehensive elegance.

The victims subsequently filed a petition for writ of mandamus in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit seeking

found a number of problems with the excluded witnesses’ reliance on the Victims’ Rights Act. °° Indeed, the circuit found
that the Act created no obligations for courts:

[*847]

The statute charily pledges only the best efforts of certain executive branch personnel to secure the rights listed. The district

separate briefs urging such a rehearing from forty-nine members of Congress, all six Attorneys General in the Tenth Circuit,
and some of the leading victims' groups in the nation. >?

In the meantime, the victims, supported by the Oklahoma Attorney General's Office, sought remedial legislation in Congress
clearly providing that victims should not have to decide between testifying at sentencing or watching the trial. A bill was
introduced to provide that watching a trial in a capital case does not constitute grounds for denying a victim the chance to
provide an impact statement. In a matter of weeks, Congress passed the Victims Rights Clarification Act of 1997, © but even
that specific statute failed to protect the bombing victims’ rights. The district court in the Oklahoma City case found that the
statute had constitutional problems. ©!

Because of the difficulty accompanying the statutory protection of victims’ rights, victims advocates decided to press for a
federal constitutional amendment. They argued that the statutory [*848] protections could not sufficiently guarantee victims'
rights. In their view, such statutes frequently fail to provide meaningful protection whenever they come into conflict with
bureaucratic habit, traditional indifference, [or] sheer inertia. ©? As the Justice Department reported:

Efforts to secure victims’ rights through means other than a constitutional amendment have proved less than fully adequate.

Cannabis Investment Report | December 2017

Cultivation Facilities

There are three general types of cannabis cultivation facilities: outdoor facilities, where cannabis is
grown under natural sunlight and widely exposed to the elements; greenhouse facilities, where canna-
bis is grown under filtered sunlight and environmental conditions are partially controlled; and indoor
facilities, where cannabis is grown under electrical lighting and environmental conditions are tightly
controlled. Some facilities combine features of these general types. For example, some greenhouses rely
primarily on filtered sunlight but also employ supplementary electrical lighting to influence the plant
flowering cycle. Each type of facility is suitable for certain purposes.

Growing indoors under electrical lighting is the most expensive way to grow cannabis, but typi-
cally yields the highest quality cannabis by providing for maximum control over variables such as
light, air, nutrition, and exposure to contaminants and pests. Electrical lighting products for indoor
cultivation include traditional and compact fluorescent lamps, high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps
and light-emitting diode (LED) lamps. Adequate carbon dioxide levels can be maintained indoors with
either bottled CO, or CO, generators. Common indoor growth mediums include soil, hydroponic
systems (wherein nutrients are added to sand, gravel or liquid growth medium) and aeroponic systems
(wherein roots hang suspended in a nutritional aerosol solution). Indoor cultivation facilities are prev-
alent in Canada and certain parts of the United States where climatic conditions are not favorable to

outdoor cannabis cultivation.

son acting in an official capacity for or on behalf of
any such government or department, agency, or in-

strumentality, or for or on behalf of any such public

international organization.! 12

As this language makes clear, the FCPA broadly
applies to corrupt payments to “any” officer or employee
of a foreign government and to those acting on the for-
eign government's behalf.!? The FCPA thus covers cor-
rupt payments to low-ranking employees and high-level
officials alike.!*

The FCPA prohibits payments to foreign officials, not
to foreign governments.'> That said, companies contem-
plating contributions or donations to foreign governments
should take steps to ensure that no monies are used for cor-
rupt purposes, such as the personal benefit of individual
foreign officials.

Department, Agency, or Instrumentality of a
Foreign Government

Foreign officials under the FCPA include officers
or employees of a department, agency, or instrumental-
ity of a foreign government. When a foreign government
is organized in a fashion similar to the US. system, what
constitutes a government department or agency is typically
clear (e.g., a ministry of energy, national security agency, or
transportation authority).!!* However, governments can be
organized in very different ways.'!” Many operate through
state-owned. and state-controlled entities, particularly in
such areas as aerospace and defense manufacturing, bank-
ing and finance, healthcare and life sciences, energy and
extractive industries, telecommunications, and transporta-
tion.'!® By including officers or employees of agencies and
instrumentalities within the definition of “foreign official,”
the FCPA accounts for this variability.

The term “instrumentality” is broad and can include
state-owned or state-controlled entities. Whether a particu-
lar entity constitutes an “instrumentality” under the FCPA

The FCPA:

Anti-Bribery Provisions

list of factors to be considered:

e the foreign state’s extent of ownership of the entity;

e the foreign state’s degree of control over the entity
(including whether key officers and directors of
the entity are, or are appointed by, government
officials);

e the foreign state’s characterization of the entity and
its employees;

e the circumstances surrounding the entity's creation;

e the purpose of the entity’s activities;

e the entity’s obligations and privileges under the
foreign state’s law;

e the exclusive or controlling power vested in the
entity to administer its designated functions;

e the level of financial support by the foreign
state (including subsidies, special tax treatment,
government-mandated fees, and loans);

e the entity's provision of services to the jurisdiction’s
residents;

e whether the governmental end or purpose sought
to be achieved is expressed in the policies of the
foreign government; and

e the general perception that the entity is performing
official or governmental functions.'”°

Companies should consider these factors when eval-
uating the risk of FCPA violations and designing compli-
ance programs.

DOJ and SEC have pursued cases involving instru-
mentalities since the time of the FCPA’s enactment and
have long used an analysis of ownership, control, status,
and function to determine whether a particular entity is
an agency or instrumentality of a foreign government.
For example, the second-ever FCPA case charged by DOJ
involved a California company that paid bribes through a

Mexican corporation to two executives of a state-owned

The Suspension of Individual
Consciousness and
The Dissolution of Self and Other
Boundaries

When we watch a group of
soldiers marching in formation, we see
the behavior of the group synchronized.
Although we can make out the

6 The lead author is Gtin R. Semin, Ph.D., an
Academy Professor, Royal Netherlands
Academy of Arts and Sciences, at Utrecht
University, The Netherlands. He is the founding
Scientific Director of the Kurt Lewin Graduate
School , a past president of the European
Association of Experimental Social Psychology,
and the Chair of the International Committee of
the Association for Psychological Science.
Semin’s research is primarily driven by an
interest in communication, social cognition as
jointly recruited process, and language and the
diverse uses that language can be put to in social
interaction (ranging from the regulation of
prejudice to that of interpersonal relationships)
as well as the embodied grounding of meaning
and communication.

A puzzle that has occupied Semin much
of his career is how it is possible to understand
social behavior by explaining individual
processes. Another puzzle has been why one
should focus on stills when human behavior is a
movie: behavior is self evidently dynamic and
highly responsive to contextual variations.
Finally, Semin has been puzzled by how tt is
possible to think that all there might be to
psychological processes 1s some symbolic
computation taking place somewhere between
the ears. As outlined in this essay, he has come
to conceptualize the social in terms of jointly
recruited processes rather than individual ones,
social behavior as situated, and psychological
processes as embodied.

individual within the group, the group
seems to be an entity of its own and the
individual soldier seems to have become
a cog in the social machine. Mob
behavior, crowds at sporting events, and
soldiers in formation all suggest that
when we are organized to act together,
the group becomes an emergent entity
that can submerge the sense of the
individual self. This apparent social
absorption stands in contrast to our
typical experience of being autonomous,
self-aware agents in the world. The
dissolution of the boundary between the
self and the group is one manifestation
of the social brain and the mechanisms
that support our ability to connect with
others.

Although not everyone has the
experience of marching in a band or
running with a mob, most people have
been part of an audience at a concert or
play. At the end of a particularly
thrilling performance, an audience can
be moved spontaneously as a group to
clap wildly. In these situations, we
know the feeling of surging to our feet as
a collective, hands clapping and faces
beaming with approval. As the clapping
blooms, individual clappers merge into a
synchronized unit.’* Similarly,
thousands of individual sports fans have
been observed to stand and raise their
hands in a synchronized fashion to
produce a collective wave that travels
around the stadium. In both cases,
individual people act as a collective unit,
a superorganismal structure, with
capacities and behaviors beyond the
reach of any single individual in the
group.

These examples are instances of
behavioral uniformity in large groups.
What is distinctive about these examples
is that the observed behavioral
synchrony can be understood in terms of

Relative value in a macro world
« Long EUR/JPY: data and positioning supportive; the Bo) has more tools to address
sustainability challenges than the ECB.

¢ Long RUB/KRW: US fiscal expansion suggests more upside for reflation sensitive
Russia than interest rate sensitive Korea.

¢ Sell German 2y vs OIS, buy 10y vs OIS: fade the impressive richening of short-
maturity German govies.

Long EUR/JPY

In a recent report we argued that EUR/JPY could appreciate in the months ahead as the
Bo) gains credibility and the ECB has to deal with QE constraints. Since then, the
EUR/JPY has appreciated by 3%, but we see more upside. Although we expect the ECB
to extend QE by a further six months in December, we see more difficulties next year.
Extending QE will require difficult decisions, such as relaxing the capital key or buying
below the depo rate. QE tapering is therefore a risk and the market could start testing
the ECB. Even if Draghi succeeds, the Euro could strengthen in the meantime. In
contrast, the Bo)’s new framework should address the sustainability challenges that
Kuroda faced this year, and allows more fiscal stimulus by keeping the government’s
borrowing costs at zero. The ECB cannot do this, in our view. We have been short
EUR/JPY this year, as we were expecting the ECB to extend QE, while the Bo) faced
challenges.

Data also suggests further EUR/JPY upside. Relative GDP growth would be consistent
with a stronger EUR/JPY, as the Eurozone has been gaining momentum, while growth in
Japan remains weak (Chart 34). Relative central bank balance sheets give the same
signal (Chart 35). Positioning is also in support, as our analysis suggests a short EUR/JPY
market position (Chart 36).

If the external environment improves, we think Japanese investors are likely to be JPY
sellers again as the hedge ratio and hedge costs have both risen. One of key factors of
the yen’s appreciation this year might have been that, as the USD/JPY fell, institutional
investors implemented additional FX-hedging to their existing forex positions as part of
their risk management, which caused the USD/JPY to fall further and supply-demand to
worsen in a vicious circle. However, this mechanism probably ran its course when the
USD/JPY reached 100 on the Brexit vote as we argued in $/¥’s eventual surge: Buy
Nikkei O06 September 2016. In fact, the USD/JPY has stopped falling during Tokyo
trading hours since the summer. Based on the decline of foreign yields and higher hedge
costs, hedged US Treasuries and German bunds had lost nearly all of their attraction for
Japanese investors by the summer. US and German 10yr government bond yields sank to
about 0% after being hedged to the JPY, reflecting that downward pressure on yields
had reached the limit. Institutional investors are expected to increase their exposure to
unhedged foreign bonds in H2 FY16. Investor behavior is especially liable to change in
April, when the new fiscal year starts.

advantage, the wealth and opportunity, that accrues to the people and nations and
businesses that can compress space and time. Die Ware liebt das Geld, Marx
famously wrote: Commodities love money. Speed is now the decisive commodity -
and it loves money. (The feeling is mutual.) Velocity lets us achieve that ancient goal
of doing more with less. The race for speed lights something competitive: The faster
I go, the faster you feel you need to go, the more powerfully you feel your slowness.

The centripetal charm of acceleration, the way that speed attracts us, and then
makes us demand even more speed, honestly surprised the earliest architects of
steamships and rail and airlines and roads. They under-guessed how popular their
tools of space-time compression would be. Surely the maximum number of people
who would ever want to zip from LA to New York would be about 1,000 per week,
jet airline pioneers assumed. Would more than a few hundred engineers really want
their own computers, Gordon Moore asked at a dinner party shortly after Intel
proposed putting his chips in the first PCs. Yes, it turned out. Billions more. Highway
designers call this surprise “induced traffic”: The faster a highway, the more people
pile onto it. Urban planners in Los Angeles in the 1950s looked at their packed,
congested roads and thought they could fix them by adding lanes. They embarked
on construction programs, tore up the transportation network that girded the city
and built a new one featuring optimistic 20-lane highways as wide as a football field
and flat as a plate. Traffic got worse.

Say’s famous economic law that “supply creates its own demand” seems especially
fulfilled in an age where velocity is so valuable. Speed too creates its own demand.
The faster any one piece of the network starts to rattle and move, the more
profoundly we notice how slow the leftover bits are. We want them accelerated too.
Total network bandwidth grew by an heroic factor of 1000 times between 2005 and
2010. Speed? It increased by just 20 times. Induced traffic.

What is it, exactly, that we’re so hungry for? The extreme end of fast connectivity is
what computer systems designers call “statefulness” —- a word that has nothing to do
with states like nations, but rather with the condition of a connection, the “state” it
is in. Early electrical circuits were either in a charged or uncharged “state”, switched
on or off. Today when we talk about a “stateful” connection, we mean a link that we
maintain, always on. It’s the difference between a video call and a letter, between
looking at your wife here and now (a “stateful connection”) and a photograph of her
(“stateless”). Real-time everywhere connection doesn’t merely kill distance; it
attacks delay too. Older generations would “break state” when they left family at

Calendar puts are attractively priced given the steep term

With the continuous low realized volatility environment, both
NKY and HSCEI 3-month minus 12-month term structures
steepened to -3.7 vol points, which are near multi-year lows.

As our Strategists think the Fed now appears concerned about
surging asset prices, investors should consider downside
hedges. Calendar puts, i.e. buying short-dated ATM puts and
selling long-dated OTM puts, are attractively priced given the
steep term structure.

Currently, we still have an open trade on NKY calendar puts (buy
Jul-17 19,500 puts vs sell Dec-17 17,500 puts) to hedge
downside risks.

The Bo)’s ongoing yield curve control has capped the
Nikkel/Topix ratio and its volatility

Japanese government bond (JGB) yield has been on a downward
trend over the last few years and has negatively impacted bank
earnings. As the Topix has higher weightings in banks than the

Nikkei, the NKY/TPX ratio has been grinding higher.

However, the NKY/TPX ratio appears to have flattened out since
the Bo}’s commitment to maintain the 10-year JGB yield at
around 0% in September 2016. With global central banks
increasingly advocating tighter monetary policies, the market
may start to speculate Bo)’s exit strategy and this may reverse
NKY/TPX’s upward trend. With TPX vol trading below NKY vol,
buying TPX calls funded by NKY calls may perform well in such a
scenario.

humans and more interested in playing with them. But Belyaev also got much more than he aimed for:
these tame foxes had floppier ears, curlier tails, smaller brains, higher serotonin levels, and much sharper
social skills than their wild relatives. These tame foxes acquired the same package that virtually all other
domesticated mammals had acquired: some desired and desirable traits and some surprises.

Belyaev’s study shows that even under highly controlled laboratory conditions, artificial selection
leaves a trail of unanticipated consequences, traits that come along for the ride. This link between desired
and unanticipated features arises because the genes that create these features are like coupled oscillators:
changes in the expression of one gene directly link to changes in the expression of others. At the level of
the traits — the gene’s expressions — some have no impact on survival or reproduction, while others may
increase or decrease these aspects of fitness. We can illustrate this point by looking at an example from
dog breeders.

Several hundred years ago, dog breeders used artificial selection to create snub-nosed breeds such
as the pug, bull dog, and boxer. The idea was to satisfy our aesthetics for diminutive noses, and reduce
the size of the dog’s classically large protuberance. Over the course of several generations of picking the
smallest-nosed members of the litter, pugs, bull dogs, and boxers emerged. But they also emerged with
an unanticipated and maladaptive health problem: all of these breeds have a harder time breathing and
staying cool than full-nosed or snouty dogs. No breeder would select for respiratory problems or an
inability to stay cool. These traits emerged as costly byproducts of selection for a diminutive nose, and
more abstractly, as a byproduct of our aesthetics. As in Tsien’s experiments on memory enhanced mice,
when we tamper with nature, we can cause great harm.

Research on the evolution of religion provides my second example of how to think about
adaptations and byproducts. The different types of religion are like the different dog breeds: distinctive in
many ways, but with a large number of shared traits in common. Most religions have a set of rules for
group membership and expulsion, ritual practices, and beliefs in the supernatural. These commonalities
suggest to some scholars that religion evolved to solve a particular problem, one that all humans confront.
That problem is large scale cooperation among unrelated strangers, a topic I pick up in greater detail
further on in this chapter. Other species cooperate, usually with a small number of individuals, mostly
close kin. As the size of potential cooperators grows, and genetic relatedness among individuals within
the group shrinks — adding more unfamiliar strangers to the mix — the potential risks of cooperating
with a cheater increases. Religion, and its core features, evolved to diminish this risk and increase the
odds of developing a society of stable cooperators. Viewed from this perspective, religion is an adaptation
— in the evolved for sense.

For those scholars who favor the idea of religion as adaptation, supporting evidence comes from

Let me tell you a bit about the Today programme. 
Today is the BBC's main morning news show; we have been part of the BBC for over 50 years and are generally 
considered one of the most important news broadcast outlets - either on radio or TV - here in the UK. We set the 
news agenda for the BBC and in many respects we set the daily news agenda for the country. Our interviews 
are regularly re broadcast across the BBC's national and international news network including - BBC World, 
BBC World Service and BBC Online. The combination of these outlets means the global 'reach' of a BBC 
Today programme interview is second to none. 
Programme guests have included a selection of some of the biggest names in politics, business, international 
relations and the arts including US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, President Nicholas Sarkozy, President 
Hamid Karzai, HRH the Prince of Wales, former President Musharraf, former Secretary of State Condoleezza

How to Charge $546 for Six Liters of Saltwater
Nina Bernstein — New York Times

It is one of the most common components of emergency medicine: an intravenous bag of sterile saltwater.

Luckily for anyone who has ever needed an IV bag to replenish lost fluids or to receive medication, itis also one of the least
expensive. The average manufacturer’s price, according to government data, has fluctuated in recent years from 44 cents to

$1.

Yet there is nothing either cheap or simple about its ultimate cost, as | learned when | tried to trace the commercial path of IV
bags from the factory to the veins of more than 100 patients struck by a May 2012 outbreak of food poisoning in upstate New
York.

Some of the patients’ bills would later include markups of 100 to 200 times the manufacturer’s price, not counting separate
charges for “IV administration.” And on other bills, a bundled charge for “IV therapy” was almost 1,000 times the official cost
of the solution.

It is no secret that medical care in the United States is overpriced. But as the tale of the humble IV bag shows all too clearly, it
is secrecy that helps keep prices high: hidden in the underbrush of transactions among multiple buyers and sellers, and in
the hieroglyphics of hospital bills.

At every step from manufacturer to patient, there are confidential deals among the major players, including drug companies,
purchasing organizations and distributors, and insurers. These deals so obscure prices and profits that even participants
cannot say what the simplest component of care actually costs, let alone what it should cost.

And that leaves taxpayers and patients alike with an inflated bottom line and little or no way to challenge it.
APRICE IN FLUX

In the food-poisoning case, some of the stricken were affluent, and others barely made ends meet. Some had private
insurance; some were covered by government programs like Medicare and Medicaid; and some were uninsured.

In the end, those factors strongly (and sometimes perversely) affected overall charges for treatment, including how much
patients were expected to pay out of pocket. Butat the beginning, there was the cost of an IV bag of normal saline, one of
more than a billion units used in the United States each year.

“People are shocked when they hear that a bag of saline solution costs far less than their cup of coffee in the morning,” said
Deborah Spak, a spokeswoman for Baxter International, one of three global pharmaceutical companies that make nearly all
the IV solutions used in the United States.

It was a rare unguarded comment. Ms. Spak — like a spokesman for Hospira, another giant in the field — later insisted that
all information about saline solution prices was private.

In fact, manufacturers are required to report such prices annually to the federal government, which bases Medicare
payments on the average national price plus 6 percent. The limit for one liter of normal saline (a little more than a quart) went
to $1.07 this year from 46 cents in 2010, an increase manufacturers linked to the cost of raw materials, fuel and
transportation. That would seem to make it the rare medical item that is cheaper in the United States than in France, where
the price at a typical hospital in Paris last year was 3.62 euros, or $4.73. One-liter IV bags normally contain nine grams of
salt, less than two teaspoons. Much of it comes from a major Morton Salt operation in Rittman, Ohio, which uses a
subterranean salt deposit formed millions of years ago. The water is local to places like Round Lake, Ill., or Rocky Mount,
N.C., where Baxter and Hospira, respectively, run their biggest automated production plants under sterility standards set by
the Food and Drug Administration.

But even before the finished product is sold by the case or the truckload, the real cost of a bag of normal saline, like the true

Mexican national oil company. ?! And in the early 1980s,
DOJ and SEC brought cases involving a $1 million bribe to
the chairman of Trinidad and Tobago’s racing authority.'”

DOJ and SEC continue to regularly bring FCPA
cases involving bribes paid to employees of agencies and
instrumentalities of foreign governments. In one such
case, the subsidiary of a Swiss engineering company paid
bribes to officials of a state-owned and controlled electric-
ity commission. The commission was created by, owned
by, and controlled by the Mexican government, and it had
a monopoly on the transmission and distribution of elec-
tricity in Mexico. Many of the commission’s board mem-
bers were cabinet-level government officials, and the direc-
tor was appointed by Mexico's president.’ Similarly, in
another recent case, Miami telecommunications executives
were charged with paying bribes to employees of Haiti’s
state-owned and controlled telecommunications company.
The telecommunications company was 97% owned and
100% controlled by the Haitian government, and its direc-
tor was appointed by Haiti’s president.

While no one factor is dispositive or necessarily more
important than another, as a practical matter, an entity is
unlikely to qualify as an instrumentality if a government
does not own or control a majority of its shares. However,
there are circumstances in which an entity would qualify
as an instrumentality absent 50% or greater foreign gov-
ernment ownership, which is reflected in the limited num-
ber of DOJ or SEC enforcement actions brought in such
situations. For example, in addition to being convicted of
funneling millions of dollars in bribes to two sitting presi-
dents in two different countries, a French issuer’s three
subsidiaries were convicted of paying bribes to employees
of a Malaysian telecommunications company that was 43%
owned by Malaysia’s Ministry of Finance. There, notwith-
standing its minority ownership stake in the company, the
Ministry held the status of a “special shareholder; had veto
power over all major expenditures, and controlled impor-
tant operational decisions.!” In addition, most senior
company officers were political appointees, including the

Chairman and Director, the Chairman of the Board of the

Tender Committee, and the Executive Director.'** Thus,

despite the Malaysian government having a minority share-
holder position, the company was an instrumentality of the
Malaysian government as the government nevertheless had
substantial control over the company.

Companies and individuals should also remember
that, whether an entity is an instrumentality of a foreign
government or a private entity, commercial (ie. private-
to-private) bribery may still violate the FCPA’s accounting
provisions, the Travel Act, anti-money laundering laws, and
other federal or foreign laws. Any type of corrupt payment

thus carries a risk of prosecution.

Public International Organizations

In 1998, the FCPA was amended to expand the defini-
tion of “foreign official” to include employees and representa-
tives of public international organizations.'”’ A “public inter-
national organization” is any organization designated as such
by Executive Order under the International Organizations
Immunities Act, 22 U.S.C. § 288, or any other organization
that the President so designates.’ Currently, public interna-
tional organizations include entities such as the World Bank,
the International Monetary Fund, the World Intellectual
Property Organization, the World Trade Organization, the
OECD, the Organization of American States, and numer-
ous others. A comprehensive list of organizations designated
as “public international organizations” is contained in 22
US.C. § 288 and can also be found on the U.S. Government
Printing Office website at http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/.

How Are Payments to Third Parties
Treated?

The FCPA expressly prohibits corrupt payments
made through third parties or intermediaries.'” Specifically,
it covers payments made to “any person, while knowing
that all or a portion of such money or thing of value will
be offered, given, or promised, directly or indirectly,” toa

country retain a local individual or company to help them

CAPITAL CHAPTER Ill Cannabis Industry Segmentation
Compared to indoor cultivation facilities that use electrical lighting, greenhouse and outdoor facili-
ties are generally less expensive to operate and more appropriate for large-scale projects, but provide less
control over growing conditions. The use of natural sunlight provides substantial savings on lighting
equipment and energy costs, but may limit the number of grow cycles per year. Outdoor and green-
house environments are more exposed to environmental risks that may negatively affect crops, such as
pests, contaminants and adverse weather. Outdoor and greenhouse cultivation facilities are prevalent in

Oregon, California and certain Latin American countries, which have climates conducive to outdoor

growing.

The Business of Cannabis Cultivation

Cultivation businesses must navigate a host of operational challenges, including state and local licensing
requirements, facility design and construction, research and acquisition of cannabis strains, intellectual
property protection, cultivation process engineering, supply-chain management, yield optimization,
facility management and security. Many cultivation businesses retain outside consultants to advise
on one or more of these issues, although some businesses manage their entire cultivation operations
internally. A cultivator may wholesale cannabis flower and other plant material to cannabis concentrate
manufacturers or retail dispensaries, or it may be part of a vertically integrated production and retail
business that sells its flower and other internally manufactured products through its own dispensaries.

Certain U.S. laws, foreign laws and international treaties currently restrict interstate and some
international movement of cannabis products. A cultivation business that wishes to scale its operations
into a new jurisdiction often must invest significant capital in a new cultivation facility located within
the new jurisdiction. As laws change to allow more interstate and international transportation of can-
nabis products, cultivators who are operating redundant facilities or expensive indoor facilities will face
increased margin pressure. As the cannabis industry matures and becomes more commoditized, we
expect the most successful cultivators will be those with strong consumer brands or scalable low-cost
operations in regions where the climate is conducive to agricultural production.

to make its best efforts to ensure [*845] that victims’ rights were protected. ” Yet this federal statute never successfully
integrated victims into the federal criminal justice process and instead became something of a dead letter. Because Congress
passed the CVRA in 2004 to remedy the problems with the 1990 Act, a brief review of the law's shortcomings is valuable.

Curiously, the 1990 Victims' Rights and Restitution Act was codified in Title 42 of the United States Code - the Title dealing
with Public Health and Welfare. Such placement effectively limited the Act's effectiveness because federal practitioners
reflexively consult Title 18, the Title that covers Crimes and Criminal Procedure, *4 for guidance on criminal law issues.
More prosaically, federal criminal enactments are bound together in a single West publication entitled the Federal Criminal
Code and Rules. This publication is carried to court by prosecutors and defense attorneys and is on the desk of most federal
judges. Because West Publishing never included the Victims' Rights Act i this book, the statute was essentially unknown even
to experienced judges and attorneys. 4°

The prime illustration of the ineffectiveness of the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act comes from the Oklahoma City
bombing case. *° While one might expect victims’ rights would have been fully protected during such a high profile trial, in
fact victims were denied one fundamental right: the right to observe court proceedings. During a pretrial motion hearing, the
district court sua sponte precluded any victim who wished to provide victim impact testimony at sentencing from observing
proceedings in the case. +7 The court based its ruling on Rule 615 of the Federal Rules of Evidence - the so-called Rule on

Witnesses. 4° Thirty-five victims and survivors of [*846] the bombing then filed a motion for reconsideration. *? They
noted that the district court apparently had overlooked the Victims’ Rights Act giving victims the right to be present at all
public court proceedings related to the offense, unless the court determines that testimony by the victim would be materially
affected if the victim heard other testimony at trial. *° The district court denied the motion for reconsideration. *! It
concluded that victims present during court proceedings would not be able to separate the experience of trial from the
experience of loss from the conduct in question, and, thus, their testimony at a sentencing hearing would be inadmissible. °?
Unlike the original ruling, which was explicitly premised on Rule 615, the later ruling was more ambiguous, alluding to

concerns under the Constitution, the common law, and the rules of evidence. >?

4 Last year, I wrote a letter to West Publishing requesting that they include the law in their book. That request became moot with the passage
of the CVRA, which moved victims’ rights from obscurity in Title 42 to centrality in Title 18, thereby guaranteeing them a spot in the West
publication.

do at every moment.

Any policy, then, must begin with a summary of our aims: “We believe the world is
entering a period of profound change that demands a shift in global arrangements.
Weare building a gatekept order consistent with our values. We welcome others to
participate in it - but with conditions. We will resist attempts to force nations into
any gatekept order; we will fight any forces that threaten disruption of the overall
system.” The China policy that emerges from this view is clear enough: We will not
contain China. We will not force China to change. Rather we will develop a profound
gatekept network for our own operation, one that layers together all the concerns of
economics, trade, security and technology - as if we were designing a technical
system for fast, constant links. We will include other nations that want to be a part
of it, as long as they are willing to bear certain costs. China is welcome to develop
her own system and see whom she might attract inside. She will not be permitted to
compel nations to join. And: If China wants the benefits of a US-led order, then
Beijing must be prepared to support the maintenance of that order. That means
deeper cooperation on everything from nuclear proliferation to the establishment of
new international bodies for connected finance, biological research or nuclear de-
proliferation.

Such an approach resolves, in an instant, the contradictions of our current policy.
Here is our gated order, we can say, join ifyou wish and on the terms we both consider
best. We should remember: China has much to worry about. Disorder would land on
her own hopes for peace and development with a profound, possibly crushing
pressure. The international order is not working as well as it might. It does not
appear engineered for new stresses. It is in cooperation for the reform of that
system that the two nations share an urgent interest. And it is in a successful
defensive posture of a gatekept, network order that Washington can cultivate the
linked, leveraged moves that will encourage this to happen. While there might be a
temptation to play this game in that old Lloyd George sort of way - “We need the
Middle East. Grab it. We need digital currency mastery. Take it!” - such efforts will
only assure final, fatal collision between the two powers. We need a gatekept order.
Build it. That is enough.

What the Seventh Sense statesman sees, in the way a Seventh Sense entrepreneur or
terrorist or researcher can, is the pulsing network logic that is at work breeding a
new world - like it or not. And our policy has to aim for that future state, not for
what we have today. If this sounds difficult, you should know that in most complex
adaptive systems these kinds of adjustments frequently occur. Rainforests. Traffic
jams. The human brain. Anyplace connections are knit and reknit at light speed can
exhibit a pattern of rapid redevelopment: The world changes. The network and its
various pieces hum, in response, to a new order. Climate shift in the Amazon, for
instance, produces drier air. The pollination cycle shortens. Flowers must adjust by
growing longer leaves to protect their moisture. Birds that rely on the flowers
develop longer, sharper beaks in response. In this way bird and flower each become
better suited to a warmer age. They co-evolve. We see this sort of interaction in

UBS View SMI (6-month target): 6,200
¢ Swiss listed companies generate a high share of profits in economies outside Switzerland. Consequently,
the Swiss equity market is affected by the recent weakening in global growth.
¢ Swiss companies try to mitigate concerns on the global economic prospects by maintaining tight cost
controls. This should allow to maintain relatively robust operating margins in 2012.
e While the Swiss franc remains overvalued, we expect the currency impact to gradually become less of a
drag. In fact, at current exchange rates, Swiss companies' earnings would show some positive currency
translation effects by end 2012, compared to the previous year.
e Still, the PE-ratio of the market is relatively high compared to the global average, indicating less
attractive value. The SMI is trading at about 12.8x realized earnings. We are thus more cautious on the
ability of the market to deliver further multiple expansion in a challenging market environment. As a
result, we maintain a small underweight stance on Swiss equities.

A Positive scenario SMI (6-month target): 6,900
e Eurozone economic growth reaccelerates meaningfully, providing relief to Swiss financials as well as
Swiss exporters. Defensive sectors would likely be left behind in a relief rally. In this scenario, we would
expect the equity market P/E to re-rate to 14x and earnings to grow by 5% over the next six months.

& Negative scenario SMI (6-month target): 5,075
¢ The sovereign debt crisis re-escalates, leading to further downside for Swiss financials and the export-
focused Industrials and Materials sectors. In this scenario, corporate earnings could drop by 5-10% over
the next six months and we would expect the P/E to contract significantly, toward 11.5x.

BRIDGE is an infrastructure debt platform initiated by Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management (EdRAM) to
enable institutional investors to access infrastructure assets with secured and stable revenue streams. BRIDGE
is a London based second generation debt fund sourcing and structuring transactions directly from sponsors
when feasible and one of the few independent debt teams only investing on behalf of clients. The BRIDGE team
has the ability to execute and deliver transactions as efficiently as traditional lenders as well as negotiate terms
and conditions bringing optimised yield and security to investors.

The BRIDGE platform was set up as a new leg of EDR’s Infrastructure, Real Assets & Structured Finance Team
striving to take advantage of the expertise of the infrastructure sector acquired when the team became a global
leader in PPP & Transport infrastructure financial advisory in 2011 and 2012.

The BRIDGE platform raised € 400m of new monies in 2016 and has successfully reached the €1bn mark of
Assets under Management at the end of 2016. The platform comprises three investment vehicles (French FCT

of institutional investors.

o BRIDGE | Dedicated Compartmentis a vehicle created by a large European institution and anchor investor of the first

o BRIDGE II reached first close in December 2016 with €150m of commitments in order to invest in three transactions.
Fundraising for BRIDGE II is still ongoing, targeting a group of institutional investors in Europe and elsewhere, with final
target size of €600m.

The BRIDGE platform has a long-term European investment strategy and a mandate to cover all sectors of
infrastructure, notably energy, renewables, utilities, transportation, telecommunications and_ social

reason our fixed income and FX strategists have only a modest further increase in bond
yields and the USD in their forecasts for next year. They project 10Y US Treasuries
rising to 2.65% and the USD to 1.02 vs the EUR. The dollar is expected to strengthen
more aggressively against both the GBP and the JPY, but even so the gain in the
currency overall has been frontloaded into 2016.

Our economists and strategists are cautious partly because the fiscal stimulus is
expected to have only a modest impact on growth, at around 0.5% of GDP. That is based
on the assumption that some of the proposals will get watered down and that the tax
cuts have a relatively low fiscal multiplier. Our US economists think that should the
fiscal stimulus be larger and more effective (for which read more infrastructure) then
US growth could surprise on the upside to around 3% in 2017 and 3.5% in 2018. That in
turn would mean a more aggressive Fed and in all likelihood a bigger rise in yields and

the USD.

Reversal: There is good taper and bad taper

The outcome of that would likely affect ECB behaviour too. Our central expectation is
for Euro Area growth of around 1 %% and inflation nudging only modestly higher. A
much more robust global economy and a stronger USD (presumably weaker EUR} would
likely put upward pressure on both of those. Indeed, in such an environment it is not
impossible to think of 10Y Treasuries pushing through 3% and the USD breaking parity
against the EUR.

That in turn would increase the pressure on the ECB to start to reverse its very loose
monetary policy stance. Tapering would then become much more likely. It would likely
push European bond yields higher too, certainly above the 65bp forecast for Bund yields
at the end of 2017.

An ECB that tapers because growth and inflation are improving would not be a bad thing
for markets. Frankly for some parts of the market, notably banks, anything which gets
the ECB away from its current policy stance back towards normality is a positive.

Indeed, the prospect of negative interest rates being reversed is the kind of thing which
Alastair Ryan (our banks strategist) lies awake at night dreaming of ( see European
Banks Strategy: repressed).

But and it is a big but, if the ECB chooses to taper because it is running out of options
or the ability to do QE that is not a good thing. Some of the hawks on the ECB would
choose to taper at the first opportunity because they never really liked the idea of QE in
the first place. A tapering at next week’s meeting even if it is couched in terms of doing
less for longer would not be good news for equity markets.

Mattola, David Copperfield and Governor Bill Richardson had relevant and discoverable information

Edwards when he knew, in fact, that the pursuit of that discovery was entirely appropriate under the

Finally, any attempt by Epstein to rely upon what he claims are undisputed facts to support his
Motion for Summary Judgment are undermined by his refusal to provide any testimony on the key issues
and evidence which would demonstrate the validity and strength of each of the claims brought against
him by Brad Edwards. Epstein’s depositions of March 17, 2010 and January 25, 2012 were replete with

Bannon the European: He’s opening the populist fort in Brussels

The former Trump strategist arrives in Europe with The Movement. Objective: an alliance
between right-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections

NEW YORK. The invasion of Europe has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru
who was Donald Trump’s right-hand man in the White House — but let go last summer following
the racist violence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. Launching, he told the
Daily Beast himself, a new non-profit foundation called The Movement, (Il Movimento), right in
the heart of Europe and its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in
view of the European elections which will be held in spring 2019.

Objective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor
of the Democratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Society has spent at least $32 billion in
support of NGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist
right, accused of plots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in
order to have labour at low cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current
Minister of the Interior Matteo Salvini.

The ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in
the European campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London
and Rome — is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great “populist international” of
which he has long since been dreaming.

The Movement, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of
strategic advice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme
European movements. Analysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and
channeling funding.

The aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of “super group” that if victorious can conquer up to a
third of the European Parliament in the elections next May.

Indeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own.

The American strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US
Congress — and in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019422.txt,"First, about network externalities: Consider the state of the computer industry circa 2000, when Microsoft's share price hit its
peak and the company seemed utterly dominant. Remember the T-shirts depicting Bill Gates as a Borg (part of the hive
mind from “Star Trek”), with the legend, “Resistance is futile. Prepare to be assimilated”? Remember when Microsoft was at
the center of concerns about antitrust enforcement?

The odd thing was that nobody seemed to like Microsoft’s products. By all accounts, Apple computers were better than PCs
using Windows as their operating system. Yet the vast majority of desktop and laptop computers ran Windows. Why?

The answer, basically, is that everyone used Windows because everyone used Windows. If you had a Windows PC and
wanted help, you could ask the guy in the next cubicle, or the tech people downstairs, and have a very good chance of
getting the answer you needed. Software was designed to run on PCs; peripheral devices were designed to work with PCs.

That’s network externalities in action, and it made Microsoft a monopolist.

The story of how that state of affairs arose is tangled, but | don’t think it’s too unfair to say that Apple mistakenly believed that
ordinary buyers would value its superior quality as much as its own people did. So it charged premium prices, and by the
time it realized how many people were choosing cheaper machines that weren’t insanely great but did the job, Microsoft's
dominance was locked in.

Now, any such discussion brings out the Apple faithful, who insist that anything Windows can do Apple can do better and
that only idiots buy PCs. They may be right. But it doesn’t matter, because there are many such idiots, myself included. And
Windows still dominates the personal computer market.

The trouble for Microsoft came with the rise of new devices whose importance it famously failed to grasp. “There’s no
chance,” declared Mr. Ballmer in 2007, “that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share.”

How could Microsoft have been so blind? Here’s where Ibn Khaldun comes in. He was a 14th-century Islamic philosopher
who basically invented what we would now call the social sciences. And one insight he had, based on the history of his
native North Africa, was that there was a rhythm to the rise and fall of dynasties.

Desert tribesmen, he argued, always have more courage and social cohesion than settled, civilized folk, so every onceina
while they will sweep in and conquer lands whose rulers have become corrupt and complacent. They create a new dynasty
— and, over time, become corrupt and complacent themselves, ready to be overrun by a new set of barbarians.

| don’t think it’s much of a stretch to apply this story to Microsoft, a company that did so well with its operating-system
monopoly that it lost focus, while Apple — still wandering in the wilderness after all those years — was alert to new
opportunities. And so the barbarians swept in from the desert.

Sometimes, by the way, barbarians are invited in by a domestic faction seeking a shake-up. This may be what’s happening
at Yahoo: Marissa Mayer doesn't look much like a fierce Bedouin chieftain, but she’s arguably filling the same functional
role.

Anyway, the funny thing is that Apple’s position in mobile devices now bears a strong resemblance to Microsoft’s former
position in operating systems. True, Apple produces high-quality products. But they are, by most accounts, little if any better
than those of rivals, while selling at premium prices.

So why do people buy them? Network externalities: lots of other people use iWhatevers, there are more apps for iOS than
for other systems, so Apple becomes the safe and easy choice. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.

Is there a policy moral here? Let me make at least a negative case: Even though Microsoft did not, in fact, end up taking over
the world, those antitrust concerns weren’t misplaced. Microsoft was a monopolist, it did extract a lot of monopoly rents, and
it did inhibit innovation. Creative destruction means that monopolies aren’t forever, but it doesn’t mean that they’re harmless
while they last. This was true for Microsoft yesterday; it may be true for Apple, or Google, or someone not yet on our radar,
tomorrow.

Billionaire Thomas J. Barrack Jr. has done what few others in Trump's orbit have

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012771.txt,"analyses of historical data together with experiments. Religious groups show higher levels of
cooperation, often over longer periods of time, than many other organized, but non-religious groups.
Religious groups also tend to last longer as groups than non-religious organizations or institutions.
Cooperation among religious groups 1s often facilitated by punishment or the implication of punishment
from a deity. In a study of 186 societies by the biologist Dominic Johnson, analyses showed that those
who believed in a strong moralizing god, capable of doling out punishment, engaged in higher levels of
cooperation, including paying taxes, complying with norms, and repaying loans. These observations are
complimented by experiments showing that people are more generous about giving away their money ina
bargaining game, and less likely to cheat, when they think about words associated with religion — divine,
God, spirit, sacred, prophet — than when they think about neutral words. For example, in the dictator
game, involving two anonymous players, one decides how much of a pot of money to give to the other.
The recipient has no say, and is thus stuck with whatever the donor offers. In general, donors give either
nothing or about half. When primed to think about religion, donors are more likely to give than keep the
entire pot, and give more as well.

The implication of these results is that the religiously-minded feel that they are being watched.
Cueing up words that are indicative of their religious beliefs, heightens their vigilance and their moral
obligations. Religion fuels altruism and fends off the temptation to cheat.

All of the observations and experiments discussed above are fascinating and relevant to
understanding the role of religion in past and present societies. But this evidence is irrelevant for
understanding the evolutionary origins of religion. It is irrelevant because it can’t determine whether
religion originally evolved to solve the problem of large scale cooperation among strangers or whether it
evolved for other reasons but was then used in the context of cooperation. This alternative explanation
sees religion as an exaptation. No one doubts that religion provides social cohesion. No one doubts that
religion also sends a buzzing reminder to the brain’s moral conscience center. But from a description of
what it does today, or even in the distant past, we can’t conclude that it evolved for this purpose. That
religious organizations show higher levels of cooperation than non-religious groups doesn’t mean they
evolved for cooperation. We also can’t conclude that religion’s effectiveness as social glue relies on
uniquely religious psychological thoughts and emotions. Though the creation of and belief in
supernatural powers may be unique to religion, other foundational beliefs and emotions are shared across
different domains of knowledge: young children attribute intentions, beliefs and desires to unseen causes,
including the movement of clouds and leaves; non-religious moral systems use punishment to embarrass,
recruit regret, and fuel shame; like many religions, non-religious institutions also attempt to reprogram the
thoughts and beliefs of its members — think of all the global rebel operatives that brainwash innocent

children into becoming child soldiers. Religion helps itself to non-religious psychology. The utility of

Ben Knight

Ben Knight headed westward from his home in North Carolina at the age of 17 to follow his
dream of documentary work and photojournalism. For 10 years, he worked as the Photo Editor
for the Daily Planet in Telluride, Colorado. His still photography, video, and editing skills are
entirely self-taught. For years he operated the projector at the Telluride Mountainfilm, soaking
in the style of the films that showed from around the globe. In 2008 Knight stood upon the stage
at the Mountainfilm Awards to accept the Director’s Choice Award as well as Audience Choice
for Best Film for Red Gold. What a journey.

Red Gold, a feature-length documentary, is set at the headwaters of the Kvichak and the
Nushagak Rivers in Bristol Bay Alaska: the two largest remaining sockeye salmon runs on the
planet. Mining companies Northern Dynasty and Anglo American have proposed to extract what
may prove to be the richest deposit of gold and copper in the world. Red Gold is a portrait of a
unique way of life that would not exist if the salmon didn't return with Bristol Bay's tide. This
film won many awards, including Best Film, Ellensburg Film Festival, Award for Cinematic
Vision, Camden International Film Festival, Audience Choice Award for Best Film, Banff
Mountain Film Festival, and Director’s Choice for Best Film, Telluride Mountain Film
(2007/2008).

had to leave your finger resting on the screen in order for the video to unspool, was
a kind of metaphor for this unbreakable relationship between touch and connection.
(As was, in a different way, the diffident “out of my life” left swipe of Tinder.)

“Good theories of the mind,” Hillis’ mentory Marvin Minksy once observed, “must
span at least three different scales of time: slow, for the billion years in which our
brains have evolved; fast, for the fleeting weeks and months of infancy and
childhood; and in between, the centuries of growth of our ideas through history.”2°8
What we face now is a new time scale to add to Minksy’s list: The instant. Super-fast
networks are different than slower ones - even ones as “slow” as what we have
today. The ideal network is one that hovers near zero latency, where the time
between what you want (or what the machines want) and the effect is as short as
possible. You click a button to watch a movie and it starts instantly. You want to shut
down an enemy air force, you do it with a single switch. The fantasy of a really “zero
latency” system is impossible of course because even electrons moving through
copper are not instant, but near-zero? Light-speed? You've probably heard stories of
high-frequency stock traders who move next door to exchanges so they can capture
and profit on an extra sliver of a millisecond. That’s the quest for low latency. (And
more proof of the profitable link between speed and money.) Our challenge will not
be about being faster - the technology will make that inevitable - it will be about
managing the insane, still unknown demands of a world of suddenness. “In a
distributed system, it is sometimes impossible to say that one of two events
occurred first,” computer engineer Leslie Lamport wrote at the start of his famous
essay “Time, Clocks and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System” - a sort of
technological parallel to Simmel’s “The Metropolis and Mental Life” written a
century earlier. The problem, Lamport explains, is that what happens in one place
can happen nearly instantly everywhere. There’s no time to react; so your entire
worldview has to be capable of update at an instant’s notice. When the time
between a Warez Dude finding an exploit and your own systems being
compromised is zero, then the discovery of the hole and the creation of your
vulnerability happen effectively at the same time. “The relation ‘happened before’”,
Lamport explains, “is therefore only a partial ordering of the events in the system.
We have found that problems often arise because people are not fully aware of this
fact and its implications.” 2°9

Networks, we are discovering, don’t only compress space and time, they are
compressing in the process the path to knowledge. We might call this “skill-time
compression”: Techniques that once took a decade of training or that demanded
access to million-dollar machines, can now be understood, applied, and then evolved

EUR rates are probably more vulnerable against US rates movements, as the market
questions whether the next ECB move will be expansion or tapering. On the other hand,
Japanese rates are insulated from foreign movements as the Bo) directly targets the
10yr yield. Japanese fiscal easing is also a possibility in light of reduced odds of TPP
implementation and a potential snap election. Any positive impact of Japanese fiscal
easing on growth is likely to manifest in higher inflation expectations under the Bo)’s
yield-targeting regime, which means Japanese real interest rates could actually fall.

Based on these considerations, we recommend buying a 6M EUR/JPY 122/130 call
spread for 1.2312% EUR (spot ref. 116.84). Risks to our trade include a severe global
shock that could strengthen the JPY, or the return of the Eurozone crisis; for example, if
the government in Italy falls after Renzi loses the referendum in December or Le Pen
wins the elections in France.

Long RUB/KRW

Post US elections and the improved outlook for fiscal expansion in the US, we see more
upside in being long oil and reflation sensitive Russia than short technology and interest
rate sensitive Korea.

We recommend being long RUB/KRW heading into 2017 targeting a move to 19.4
(spot ref 18, stop 16.7). The trade is positive carry 2% per quarter.

The rise in US breakeven inflation is positive for risky assets broadly but could be
painful in the short term for highly indebted countries with low interest rates. Higher US
breakeven inflation rates are historically associated with higher RUB/KRW (Chart 37).

Higher US real rates are also less of a threat for Russia where local real yields are
significantly higher than Korea (Table 2) and most EM peers. Korea also has relatively
high private sector debt which could face pressure if BoK is forced to raise rates.
Household debt has been rising at an alarming rate and domestic political turmoil facing
the Park administration has also added to concerns.

In our baseline scenarios, we expect a modest growth recovery for Korea but a stronger
delta for Russia where the oil price collapse over 2014-15 led to a much sharper
slowdown earlier and activity is now in recovery stage.

The ToT trade shock that hit Russia in 2014 led to material underperformance in exports
vs Korea. Over 2011-13, Russia and Korean exports were growing at about the same
rates but since 2014 that gap widened has materially against Russia. Since early 2016,
however, this has reversed with Russia catching up. In 2017, Russian exports growth
could outperform Korea given the outlook for oil. Moreover, it is less reliant on China or
Japan and more reliant on Europe. CNH/KRW as well as JPY/KRW remains near multi year

"
IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021305.txt,"a shared social goal. Sometimes the goal
is spontaneous as in clapping to
demonstrate appreciation and sometimes
the goal is imposed by the situation (e.g.,
musicians following a musical score and
instructions of a conductor, soldiers
marching to the call of a drill sergeant).
However, when we behave in synchrony
with others, there is a sense of becoming
part of something larger than ourselves.

To the people engaged in
spontaneously synchronized behavior,
there is a clearly identifiable and
seemingly individual ‘cause’ for their
emergent behavior. But when a group
shares the same goal—demonstrating
approval—and engages in the same
action—clapping—the stage is set for
such behavior to become coordinated
and organized even without an external
agent (conductor or drill sergeant). How
do those moments of spontaneous social
aggregation occur? How does the social
brain work to join with others to form
the emergent group?

We have begun to understand the
underlying dynamics of how and when
such phenomena are likely to occur and
even how such phenomena can be
potentially engineered. New insights
afforded by developments in social
psychology, developmental psychology,
and social neuroscience have suggested
the way in which our brains respond to
the invisible force of social connection.
These scientific developments suggest
neural mechanisms that may be
important to the way we interact with
others. At the same time, the insights
also reveal the likely conditions under
which individual self merges into the
group. Such situations when the sense of
self is suspended contrast sharply with
the modern Western notion of the
individual standing apart from others.
Indeed, the traditional Western focus on

Page |59

individual-centered reasons, motives,
intentions, and causes may be at odds
with some forms of spontaneously
synchronized behaviors and group
action.

Towards a Biology of Social
Interaction

Consider the perspective of an
engaged spectator at a singles tennis
match. Although we may be sitting
distant from competitors, if we identify
with one of the players we are not
merely passive observers. On the
contrary, our observation of the events in
the game can serve to activate some of
the same neural mechanisms that would
be active if we were playing the game
rather than just observing it. We can feel
the moves, feel the impetus to defend an
attack, and feel the urge to slam the ball
as if we ourselves are playing, albeit
without actually flailing our arms
around. We may even anticipate a move
by the opponent and imagine ourselves
making the potential response. Research
over the last 10 years or so has revealed
that our brains can map the movements
of other human beings onto our own
bodies almost as if we were making
those movements’. This ability to put
ourselves in another person’s shoes
makes it possible to identify with either
player.

By comparison to the audience,
consider how this ability can serve us as
one of the players. This capacity
provides an important facility for
anticipating our opponent’s moves
allowing us to plan a response even
before the opponent has completed a
groundstroke. This kind of anticipation
does not depend on explicit reasoning or
conscious reflection—it seems to operate
as an automatic mechanism **. This
kind of mechanism may facilitate

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018361.txt,"(Yes.) Do you write it in English? (To be determined!) Working with composer Brian
Eno on the sound of the clock chime, and with a team of geologists and physicists,
Hillis had made the clock into a natural extension of his tinkertoy computer, a device
that both served a purpose and sent a message. If there was an emotion it conveyed,
a feeling that it tickled in the way Bernini’s Apollo and Daphne might inspire terror
or joy or faith, it was meant to be awe.

Stewart Brand, one of the supporters of the clock and an early member of the New
Caste too, would tell you that the idea for the clock had emerged from a desire to
emphasize, to physicalize in a way no one could forget, the importance of longer-
term thinking. We'd all arrived now, Brand and the other clock masters worried, ata
moment in history when no one had a view that extended much past their own lives
— or sometimes past the next election, or year, or the next financial quarter. Our
modern “on to the next thing” economics and politics were eroding every slow,
patient instinct. “Civilization is revving itself into a pathetically short attention
span,” one manifesto for the clock began. “What we propose is both a mechanism
and a myth.”!7? With its steady 10,000 year ticking, the Clock of the Long Now was
meant to make us think in longer jumps. The human winding mechanism, for
instance: Generations of clock-winders had to share in the work, and they would be
connected in a long thread over the 10,000 years. A sacred priesthood of time.
Moving slowly. As I spent time thinking, dreaming about the clock, I found myself
too craving the solidity and patient isolation it promised. Who among us these days
doesn’t want a break from the instant nowness of our age?

Yet, the more | understood the clock, the more | realized something else was at
work. Stop fora moment to consider who was backing and building the device. It
was a cluster of people who had, as a common link, the fact that they had their hands
honestly sunk into the guts of the Internet. Hillis, after all, had been waving more
than that slim book of email addresses when he talked about the early days of the
Internet. He was waving the credentials of a man who had been living in the virtual
cyber neighborhood of Web connections from its very first days. He was as close toa
native of the connected, fiber optic, light-speed world as you could find.

All the names supporting the clock smelled similarly of burning electrons: Jeff Bezos
had built Amazon into a high-speed marketplace whose backbone was the Web
itself. Another backer, Mitch Kapor, had cracked apart several centuries of slow
accounting habits when he created Lotus 1-2-3, the first successful computer
spreadsheet program in 1983, software that permitted you to see and change your
whole business one keystroke at a time. Kapor’s software helped move finance from
quarter-by-quarter calculations to a really instant-by-instant sort of business - more
or less the opposite of the “long time frame” the clock team was aiming to preserve.
Esther Dyson was one of the earliest, best investors in network companies. This was
a collection of men and women unified by a genius for connected change, sure, but
also by a desire for ever faster clock speeds, ever speedier delivery, ever faster

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021311.txt,"You and I as One

Any social group can be thought
of as either a collection of individuals or
as a single new entity with emergent,
unified group behavior. When a mob
forms to surge together down a street
one way and then another; when a flock
of birds wheels about together, closely
clustered as they fly without colliding;
and when an orchestra performs with
highly coordinated timing, we
momentarily forget about the individuals
and see the collective behavior as a new,
single social entity. Indeed, as Cacioppo
discusses, many species seem to gather,
flock, and coordinate to form such
collectives. For humans there are many
situations from flash mobs and sports
teams to choirs and audiences, when
people congregate in this way.

The drive for people to affiliate
and group is not sufficient on its own to
produce the coordinated behavior that
emerges from such a collective.
Sometimes an organizing signal, like the
conductor of an orchestra, can
synchronize the behavior. Other times
common goals and behavioral
constraints can synchronize a group, as
in a flock of birds. In his chapter, Giin
Semin discusses how such synchrony
may be self-organizing — that is, it is
achieved without intention, effort, or
awareness by our social brains, even
when there is no clear signal or
constraint. In cases of such human
sociality, the group may act as though it
has a single mind. Indeed, Semin
approaches this issue to relate the
collective behavior as an embodied
consequence of individual social forces
that jointly operate to satisfy our need to
affiliate, and to consider how connecting
behavior through synchrony may create
a collective mind.

Page |65

Howard Nusbaum specifically
discusses a different invisible social
force that has evolved with the power to
bind people into a collective—language.
Language is the richest social signal that
has the power to move people to act and
to move groups to act together. In order
for language to act as a force, it must
somehow affect people with sufficient
social and emotional impact. As
Nusbaum discusses the impact of
language, it operates at a social and
emotional level similar to that discussed
by Semin rather than exclusively
through the inferences drawn from
meaning.

The rape wasn't reported until Friday, when police—investigating reports of highway robbery—discovered a photo of a

policewoman near where the thefts occurred. The superintendent of police asked her why her photo was there and only
then did she report the rape, Mr. Pradhan said.

Is there any space in the development debate for African experts?
Andrew Quinn — Guardian blog

Ata 2012 TEDxChange conference in Berlin, African women's development fund CEO Theo Sowa turned the spotlight on
an uncomfortable truth: African women may be the focus of many development campaigns, but they are rarely represented
as drivers of the discussion.

When people portray us as victims, they don't want to ask us about solutions. Because people don't ask victims for
solutions, Sowa told the audience.

Of course, experts from Africa and other parts of the developing world are pioneering solutions to a vast range of
development challenges on everything from improving maternal health to boosting sustainable crop output. Bringing their
perspectives to light should be an integral part of development work, particularly as the international community
contemplates the next steps in the global development agenda beyond the 2015 MDGs.

Celebrity advocates, government officials and major funders all have ready-made platforms for spreading their views — the
power of their brand is often enough to build an audience.

But for those without immediate recognition, the task is harder. The Aspen Institute's New Voices Fellowship, launched this
year with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation, is one attempt to start figuring out an answer by providing both
media coaching and contacts for development experts from Africa and, eventually, other parts of the developing world.

Development experts, so focused on their endless and crucial work, often neglect this area. Yet finding ways to leverage
yours or your colleagues’ public visibility is not as difficult as it sounds. Media training can be expensive, but enormously
beneficial. Persistence pays off. And above all, helping people to think like thought leaders can bring real results.

Our fellows represents a cross-section of the work under way in Africa today, from a Congolese doctor seeking to build a
health system in one of the remotest parts of his country to a Ghanaian tech entrepreneur devising new strategies for
expanding math and science education in rural communities. Each one is an expert, and each one has a story to tell.
Helping them to craft their stories, and find an audience, have been our challenges.

The audience, at least initially, has been the easy part. The explosion of online and issue-driven media over the past decade
has created a wide range of outlets, many of which are eager to bring new voices to light. Development-focused media such
as the Guardian's Global Development section, general interest aggregators such as the Huffington Post, and geographic
specialists such as AllAfrica.com and Think Africa Press all represent potential platforms for fresh writing about
development issues. Even mainstream outlets such as CNN and Al Jazeera are welcoming new contributors for their
opinion sections, while professional community portals such as Business Fights Poverty and the Guardian Global
Development Professionals Network can open the door to engaged specialists who care deeply about the challenges
ahead.

Add to this the increasingly crowded schedule of conferences and meetings ranging from the Clinton Global Initiative and

Skoll World Forum to TEDx events held around the world and it's clear that there are a wealth of opportunities to reach
important audiences with new stories.

The BRIDGE platform currently comprises investments of between €20-120 million each, in 17 European
infrastructure transactions. In 2016 alone, the BRIDGE team has achieved financial close for 11 infrastructure
deals in Europe aggregating ca. €390m. When benchmarked against other similar funds, the investment team
has succeeded in deploying faster and with credit spreads well above the infrastructure senior debt
benchmark, enabling BRIDGE to become a force in the growing institutions-backed infrastructure debt market.
BRIDGE’s ability to invest beyond the traditional definition of core infrastructure and to structure transactions
was a key differentiator when Edmond de Rothschild launched this platform, as part of its commitment to real
economy. BRIDGE is innovative in the sense that the investment team sources transactions directly from
sponsors and is actively involved in the structuring phase, acting as Mandated Lead Arranger.

BRIDGE comprises a large, international and skilled London based investment team of 11 investment
professionals who between them have arranged more than €100bn of landmark infrastructure deals over the

Consensus downgrades in our base case — but less than average

Our base case 7% EPS growth assumption is below the current bottom up consensus of
+14%. Hence, for now we don’t see the prospect of a sustained upgrade cycle.
Consensus downgrades are the norm however. 2010 was the last year that consensus
forecasts started the year too low. In fact, consensus was too high in 12 of the last 17
years. Moreover, our estimate of 7% EPS growth in 2017 implies less downgrades than
usual (10% is the average). It’s also worth noting that over the past 17 years annual
consensus downgrades of less than 10% have never been accompanied by negative
equity returns for the same calendar year.

Sector EPS growth prospects

Correlation analysis of sector earnings growth against global GDP suggests that Banks are
the sector that may be most sensitive to improvements in global economy. Interest rate
developments are likely the key to earnings but they in turn should reflect the nominal
growth environment. Real economic growth would also have some effect on credit volumes
and collateral valuations though, reinforcing the link from the economy to Bank earings.

Cyclicals unsurprisingly dominate the other sectors with EPS growth geared to global
growth. Basic Resources, Chemicals, Tech and Industrials all exhibit a correlation above
70%. Some other cyclicals including Autos and Construction have been had much less
correlated EPS growth to global GDP in recent years. In part that reflects that significant
earnings volatility in the period analysed. What’s notable for both groups is that
expectations already look high for both sectors. Consensus estimates also factor ina
rebound in Resources sector EPS growth — but both these sectors have seen the largest
earnings declines over the past five years. Forecasts look more restrained in Industrials,
Chemicals, Tech — implying mid to high single digit growth in the coming three years.

Among Defensives expectations look highest in Telecoms — suggesting 10% average
EPS growth in 2016-18 despite the weak trend rate for sector earnings in recent years.
Consensus forecasts imply a more modest improvement for Utilities — with just 1% EPS
CAGR for 2016-18. Staples and Healthcare are forecast to have high single digit EPS
growth in the coming 3 years, implying 2-3pp improvements in the annual growth rate
relative the trailing 5-year average for Staples and +6pp for Healthcare.

ment generally need prove only that one act in furtherance
of the conspiracy occurred during the limitations period,
thus enabling the government to prosecute bribes paid or
accounting violations occurring more than five years prior
to the filing of formal charges.”

There are at least two ways in which the applicable
limitations period is commonly extended. First, compa-
nies or individuals cooperating with DOJ may enter into
a tolling agreement that voluntarily extends the limitations
period. Second, under 18 US.C. § 3292, the government
may seek a court order suspending the statute of limitations
posed in a criminal case for up to three years in order to
obtain evidence from foreign countries. Generally, the sus-
pension period begins when the official request is made by
the US. government to the foreign authority and ends on
the date on which the foreign authority takes final action

on the request.”

Statute of Limitations in Civil Actions

In civil cases brought by SEC, the statute of limita-
tions is set by 28 U.S.C. § 2462, which provides for a five-
year limitation on any “suit or proceeding for the enforce-
ment of any civil fine, penalty, or forfeiture.” The five-year
period begins to run “when the claim first accrued.” The
five-year limitations period applies to SEC actions seek-
ing civil penalties, but it does not prevent SEC from
seeking equitable remedies, such as an injunction or the
disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, for conduct pre-dating
the five-year period. In cases against individuals who are
not residents of the United States, the statute is tolled for
any period when the defendants are not “found within the
United States in order that proper service may be made
thereon.”*!° Furthermore, companies or individuals coop-
erating with SEC may enter into tolling agreements that

voluntarily extend the limitations period.

Cannabis Plant Tissue Cultures

Synthetic cannabinoids and terpenes can be manufactured by modifying plant-based compounds
or through tools of synthetic biology and biocatalysis. For example, a synthetic version of THC
known as dronabinol is the active compound in the pharmaceutical product Marinol, which was
approved by the FDA in 1985 for use in treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer
chemotherapy. Methods for biosynthetic production of cannabinoids have been patented in the United
States. Some medical practitioners and cannabis users have found synthetic compounds to be less effec-
tive than plant-based cannabinoids and have attributed this reduced efficacy to the lack of an entourage
effect.

Dosage, Safety and Side Effects
Cannabis dosing schedules provided by doctors and producers generally lack scientific rigor and,
although industry participants strive to create a reliable dosing framework, users generally determine
dosage through self-titration and trial and error. (This method of dosing does not always lead to the
desired effect, but it is generally agreed that there is a low risk of death from an overdose of cannabis.)
Product packaging commonly indicates that a 10-mg serving of cannabinoids represents one dose,
and servings of 2 mg to 5 mg are commonly characterized as “microdoses.” Examples of representative
dosage amounts used to treat some common medical conditions are presented in the following table.

education —She married hedge funder Glen Dubin. Together they financed the Dubin Breast Center at Mount
Sinai Hospital.

Epstein will sometimes move a meeting in his dining room outside to Central park—his idea of going out to
lunch is a Sabrett’s hot dog—with the various young women in the house acting as the accompanying
entourage, as though something out of an 18th-century French court.

But the Hefnerian like attitude can also atthe flash turn to sharply honed financial discussion. The highly
poised young women ina mansion on the Upper East Side with various office responsibilities remind me of the
various uptown art galleries in the surrounding neighborhood. They mingle freely with his hyper powerful
guests, not so much as hostesses—or, in tabloid language, harem-like “sex slaves”—but as attentive colleagues
(which, of course, might be regarded by some as having its own fetish-like attraction). Epstein explicitly
denies , and is seconded by the group that there is no sexual quid pro quo. (“If you’re sleeping someone you
work with they then believe they can come in late—that’s what Jimmy Goldsmith used to say.”) Still, the
constant attendance of so many comely young women, seems so outside of conventional living or staffing or
social or romantic relationships that it is hard to describe ina straightforward or non- smirky way. And while
it has been said that it may be part of the appeal for the men who come to visit Epstein, it is as well a
peculiarity for them that they merely put up with in order to spend time with him.

The Epstein house/office is, by careful design, exclusive and clubby, part hang out, part secret society. Along
with the fact that, even after his jail term, the rich and powerful have continued to so eagerly solicit him, it’s
also notable in the fixed hierarchy of who comes to whose turf, that, when they want to see Epstein, they tend to
come to him. He’s created a world and you enter it. Many arrive in weekend clothes. or as one world leader
said , Ah _ here ican come in sweat clothes .

His conversations are less meeting-like—focused and agenda-driven—then narrative therapy . In effect: the
outside world comes to Epstein’s and he eagerly solicits reports. It’s a real time newspaper, or the news you
don’t read in a newspaper, market movements before they occur, geopolitics with the ultimate decision makers
at the table, the health and personal eccentricities of some world leaders, discussions in hushed tones of the
next high level government appointments soon to be announced.

It’s Sunday lunch—in his schedule from a week last fall—with Gates, Mort Zuckerman, the real estate
billionaire and owner of the Daily News, and Peter Thiel, the PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor.
That evening its Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim, the foreign minister of Qatar. Hamad lives across the street in a
similarly furnished house—he and Epstein have the same decorator. (Epstein, in his relaxed and amused
manner, keeps prodding: “Why are you financing the bad guys? What do you get out of that?”’)

Next morning, Epstein is joined for breakfast in the dining room by the lawyer Reid Weingarten, who’s
represented, among other fat cats in trouble, Worldcom’s Bernie Ebbers and Goldman Sachs’s Lloyd
Blankfein. Weingarten, hoarse with a cold, is still lamenting his failed defense of former Connecticut Governor
John Rowland. (later to be overturned on appeal ) After a blow-by-blow of the trial, they discuss the
Qatarian’s visit—Epstein served chocolate made with specialy chosen pistachios grown on the Sheikh’s
farm—and speculate about who actually controls ISIS, with Weingarten arguing that the Turks are not getting
enough scrutiny. Weingarten represents Gulen , the U.S. target of the Turks, There is, in Epstein’s dining
room, always an alternative version of world events—“perception versus reality,” says Epstein, “not to imply
that one necessarily has greater weight than the other.”

“Why,” I ask Weingarten, when Epstein briefly steps out of the room, “do so many people keep coming back
here, everything considered.”

“Why we camp out here? I guess because there’s truly no other place like it.”

Epstein summons in the next person cooling his heels in the ante-room. It’s a young man named Brock Pierce,
an active investor” in Bitcoin and the programmable currency space. Epsteins blackboard gets quickly filled
with the details of the Bitcoin blockchain mathematics,

After a bit, Epstein invites his next appointment to join them: Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary and
President of Harvard, off Diet Coke, digs deep into the Sheikh Hamad chocolates, then focuses in on the
Bitcoin investor.

2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *868

of, and consider victims' views about, prospective plea negotiations. '** Twenty-nine states already require prosecutors to
159

consult with or obtain the views of victims at the plea agreement stage.
The proposed rule helps to implement not only a victim's right to be heard at plea proceedings but also the right to confer with
the attorney for the Government. !©° Given that victims have the right to confer, the conferring should take place at the most
salient points in the process. As Senator Feinstein explained, This right [to confer] is intended to be expansive. For example,
the victim has the [*869] right to confer with the Government concerning any critical stage or disposition of the case. 16!
Because the overwhelming majority of federal criminal cases are resolved by a plea, a conference between the victim and the
prosecutor regarding the plea will be critical in most cases. Reflecting that fact, the rules should follow the approach taken by
the majority of states, directing prosecutors to consult with victims about pleas.

Rule 11(c)(2) - Court To Be Advised of Victim Objections to Plea
The Proposal:

Prosecutors (and victims' attorneys) should be required to advise the court whenever they are aware that the victim objects to a
proposed plea agreement as follows:

(2) Disclosing a Plea Agreement. The parties must disclose the plea agreement in open court when the plea is offered, unless
the court for good cause allows the parties to disclose the plea agreement in camera. When a plea is presented in open court, the
attorney for the government or the attorney for any victim shall advise the court when the attorney is aware that the victim has
any objection to the proposed plea agreement.

The Rationale:

When an attorney for the victim or for the government is aware that a victim objects to a plea, that information should be
relayed to the court. In those rare cases where the victim has an attorney, the attorney will obviously raise the victim's
objection. The proposed rule change clarifies the prosecutor's corresponding and equal obligation to communicate this
information to the court.

The CVRA appears to obligate prosecutors to relay a victim's objection to the court, commanding them to use their best
efforts to enforce victims' rights. '* Part of those best efforts would seem to be conveying objections to the court. Victims
are often untrained in the law and unexpectedly thrust into criminal proceedings; they may well believe that prosecutors
automatically relay to the court [*870] their objections to the plea. The proposed rule avoids such confusion by requiring the
prosecutor to notify the court of a victim's concern. The rule is limited to situations where the prosecutor is aware of an
objection.

1

This approach is consistent with the instructive case of State v. Casey, !© which considered whether a victim's objection to a

plea made to a prosecutor was sufficient to trigger the victim's right to be heard under the Utah Constitution. !°4 In Casey, the
victim told the prosecutor that she opposed a plea arrangement. The prosecutor refused to convey the victim's concern to the

158 2005 A.G. Guidelines, supra note 38, at 30 (defining what can be considered in determining whether notice is reasonable in a particular
case); see also Office for Victims of Crime, supra note 137, at 75 (Prosecutors should make every effort ... to consult with the victim on the
terms of any negotiated plea ... .).

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018407.txt,"the power-law dynamics Brian Arthur found in the most successful network
arrangements. Getting it right is enough of a task. If we can manage that, what we
build will run with unimpeachable legitimacy. Chosen, not forced.

A third principle is that our gates and protocols and webs ought to be open to
others, but with each new link weighed, added to the scale of strategic balance with
exacting care. An overarching, systemic view should inform us. Nations that want to
use our cyber security systems, for instance, should join research cooperatives - and
possibly shoulder as well some problems of global network health like the
implementation of IPv6 or DNSSEC, or any of the future jointly secur standars that
will emerge. They should even - here is where the leap comes - be required to
cooperate on nuclear proliferation, cybercrime, or trade norms. The puzzle here is
clear: How to use our strengths to address our dangers? While we can’t directly
press our lead in cancer research to stop national flirtations with nuclear bombs or
cyber crime, it’s probably true that a cost of weapons proliferation should be
exclusion from life-giving technical and trade and other gated orders. Remember
that feature of network systems now, how the cost of exclusion grows even faster
than the benefits of inclusion? If the aim of any society in this connected age is to
accelerate the compression of time for its citizens, than life outside the best gates for
this will be a nearly fatal political cost. Do you really want to rely on French
computers? Wear Indian bikinis? Do Iranians want to rely on Iranian cyber-security
tools alone? It is ever-easier for citizens of nations sliced free from vital networks to
feel what they don’t have.

The courage to leave some nations out of the order we're constructing — and to cut
others out - doesn’t come easily to us. Today we don’t really engage ina
comprehensive, linked strategy. Iranian proliferation and Chinese finance and Saudi
military support are, for all practical purposes, separated in our contemplation of
the world. Hard Gatekeeping frames these together as a piece; it spots the
topological string running between each and gives us a firm position from which to
pull the threads we want. We will come to know, to pay, the costs of over-inclusion.
But this also means that we must be concerned with the security and safety of
others, on our network or on others. To attempt to achieve absolute American
security, to do so at the expense of other nations - this will not only erode the
credibility of any system we build. It will also make them fundamentally less
effective. We are, after all, what we are conneted to.

Fourth, no nation should be permitted to force another inside of its own gates. India
might develop a great search engine; they should not be allowed to force
Bangladeshis to use it. China may develop clever trade channels to Europe; they
should not drive their use with military pressure. This principle is the flip side of our
own commitment not to compel others into American gatekept systems. It
represents an important nod to sovereign power: Each nation decides on its own. If
we're intent on avoiding some of the chaos of the last major system change, which
produced the Thirty Years War, we should learn its lessons. That fight
fundamentally touched on one question: Who decides what happens inside a
country? The specific problem of Europe 350 years ago was if each King could

raids on medical marijuana dispensaries, but they haven’ t stopped.

[In 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder issued a memo ordering an
end to federal raids of medical marijuana dispensaries. In March 2011,
there were 28 such raids in a duration of 24 hours.]

Here’ s how | understand Washington. America’ s_ puritanical
political process serves as a buffer between the status quo and the force of
evolution. For instance, in order to get Republican votes for the children’ s
healthcare bill, Democrats agreed to fund $28 million to the/r abstinence-

And, during your own campaign, you admitted, in the context of
health care reform, that the multinational insurance conglomeration is so
firmly entrenched that you would be unable to dispense with it. So there
would have to be compromises. Now, what with the compromises made to
help passage of Prop. 19, amnesty becomes the single-payer system of
marijuana reform, and growing your own pot becomes the public option.
Meanwhile, as long as any government can arbitrarily decide which drugs

with him if he was the butcher. They're with Jean-Luc because he's the boss. Jean-Luc likes
drugs and silent rape. It excites him.

I really despise Jean-Luc as a human being for the way he's cheapened the business, says John
Casablancas. There is no justice. This is a guy who should be behind bars. There was a little
group, Jean-Luc, Patrick Gilles, and Varsano...They were very well-known in Paris for roaming
the clubs. They would invite girls and put drugs in their drinks. Everybody knew they were
creeps.

It should be noted that aside from being a professional rival, Casablancas, the founder of the
agency Elite, was eventually drubbed out of the industry for his own modelizing. How pervy do
you have to be for John Casablancas to call you a perv?

Pervy enough to drug and rape numerous teenagers, according to 60 Minutes and Diane Sawyer,
who investigated Brunel in 1988. The program interviewed nearly two dozen models who said
they had been sexually assaulted by Brunel and/or by his fellow agent, Claude Haddad. Even at
that time, Brunel had a reputation as a man one could go to to procure a date with a young
model. CBS spoke to five models who said that Brunel and/or his friends had drugged and raped
them. Said producer Craig Pyes, Hundreds of girls were not only harassed, but molested.

When Gross interviewed Brunel, this is what he had to say for himself:

“You get laid tonight with a model, is that a crime? I don't understand why people go into your
personal life, what you do yourself, and to yourself, and they don't look at things that are really
important.”

Since then, Brunel has been involved with a succession of agencies in New York and Paris.
Although the 60 Minutes scandal eventually led Eileen Ford to stop working with him, he
continued his involvement with Karins. In 1988, when powerhouse agency Next opened its
doors, Brunel took an ownership stake. He also discovered Christy Turlington when she was
14. MC2 is only his latest venture. Because no criminal charges were ever filed by any of his
accusers, and because the industry has a short memory — most models working today weren't
even born when Sawyer and Pyes started looking into Brunel's activities — Brunel has been free
to continue as he pleases. A French citizen, he even avoided testifying in his friend Epstein's
trial.

And so Brunel is still criss-crossing the globe, trawling for 5'10 13-year-olds from Eastern
Europe and (the whiter parts of) South America. And apparently taking the occasional ride with

them on Epstein’s private jet. Is there any better argument for the regulation of the modeling
industry?

asking questions and teenage girls

started talking, a wave of legal
resistance followed.

Tf Palm Beach police didn’t know
quite who Jeffrey Epstein was, they
found out soon enough.

Epstein, now 53, was a quintes-
sential man of mystery. He amassed
his fortune and friends quietly,
always in the background as he
navigated New York high society.

When he first attracted notice in
the early 1990s, it was on account of
the woman he was dating: Ghislaine
Maxwell, daughter of the late British
media tycoon Robert Maxwell.

In a lengthy article, headlined
*The Mystery of Ghislaine Max-
well’s Secret Love,” the British Mail
on Sunday tabloid laid out specula-
tive stories that the socialite’s beau
was a CIA spook, a math teacher, a
concert pianist or a corporate head-
hunter.

“But what is the truth about
him?” the newspaper wondered.
“Like Maxwell, Epstein is both
flamboyant and intensely private.”

The media frenzy did not begin
in full until a decade later. In Sep-
tember 2002, Epstein was flung into
the limelight when he flew Clinton
and actors Kevin Spacey and Chris
Tucker to Africa on his private jet.

Suddenly everyone wanted to
know who Epstein was. New York
magazine and Vanity Fair published
lengthy profiles. The New York Post
listed him as one of the city’s most
eligible bachelors and began
describing him in its gossip columns
with adjectives such as “mysterious”
and “reclusive.”

Although Epstein gave no inter-
views, the broad strokes of his past
started to come into focus,

Building a life of extravagance

He was born blue-collar in 1953,
the son of a New York City parks
department employee, and raised in
Brookiyn’s Coney Island neighbor-
hood. He left college without a
bachelor’s degree but became a
math teacher at the prestigious
Dalton School in Manhattan.

The story goes that the father of
one of Epstein’s students was so
impressed with the man that he put
him in touch with a senior partner at
Bear Stearns, the global investment
bank and securities firm.

In 1976, Epstein left Dalton for a
job at Bear Stearns. By the early
1980s, he had started J. Epstein and
Co. That is when he began making
his millions in earnest,

ner, founder of The Limited retail

‘ chain and a former Palm Beacher

who is said to have been a mentor to

- Epstein.

a

Wexner sold Epstein one of his
most lavish residences: a massive
townhouse that dominates a block
on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. It
is reported to have, among its finer
features, closed-circuit television
and a heated sidewalk to melt away
fallen snow.

That townhouse, thought to be
the largest private residence in
Manhattan, is only a piece of the
extravagant world Epstein built over
time.

In New Mexico, he constructed a
27,000-square-foot hilltop mansion
onai0,000-acre ranch outside Santa
Fe. Many believed itto be the largest
home in the state.

In Palm Beach, he bought a
waterfront home on Ei Brillo Way.
And he owns a 100-acre private
island in the Virgin Islands.

Perhaps as remarkable as his
Javish homes is his extensive net-
work of friends and associates at the
highest echelons of power. This
includes not only socialites but also
business tycoons, media moguls,
politicians, royalty and Nobel Prize-
winning scientists whose research

‘ he often funds.

“Just like other people collect
art, he collects scientists,” said
Martin Nowak, who directs the
Program for Evolutionary Dynamics
at Harvard University and was

reportedly the recipient of a $30 °
million research donation from ,

Epstein.

Epstein is said to have
befriended former Harvard Presi-
dent Larry Summers, prominent law

| Professor Alan Dershowitz, Donald
* Trump and New York Daily News
; Publisher Mort Zuckerman.

And yét he managed for decades |

to maintain a low profile. He avoids

* eating out and was rarely photo-
| graphed.

“The odd thing is I never met
him,” said Dominick Dunne, the
famous chronicler of the trials and
tribulations of the very rich. “I wasn’t
even aware of him,” except fora
Vanity Fair article.

Epstein’s friendship with Clinton
has attracted the most attention.

Epstein met Clinton as early as
1995, when he paid tens of thou-
sands of dollars to join him at an
intimate fund-raising dinner in Palm
Beach. But from all appearances,
they did not become close friends
until after Clinton left the Oval Office
and moved to New York.

Epstein has donated more than
$100,000 to Democratic candidates’
campaigns, incliding John Kerry’s
presidential bid, the reelection
campaign of New Mexico Gov, Bill
Richardson and the Senate bids of
Joe Lieberman, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, Christopher Dodd and
Charles Schumer.

Powerful friends and enemies

A Vanity Fair profile found
cracks in the veneer of Epstein’s life
story. The 2003 article said he left
Bear Stearns in the wake of a federal
probe and a possible Securities and
Exchange Commission violation. It
also pointed out that Citibank once
sued him for defaulting on a $20
million loan.

The article suggested that one of
his business mentors and previous
employers was Steven Hoffenberg,
now serving a prison term after
“bilking investors out of more than
$450 million in one of the largest
Ponzi schemes in American histo-

ry. |

As he amassed his wealth,
Epstein made enemies in disputes
both large and small. He sued the
man who in 1990 sold him his
multimillion-dollar Palm Beach
home over a dispute about less than
$%6,000 in furnishings.

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022156
"
TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022707.txt,"﻿	It’s an absurdly vast house, among the largest in Manhattan, but the dining room is windowless, creating a hermetic or stop-time sense, broken only by the household help ferrying in time-of-day-appropriate foods and beverages. 
     In sweatshirt, draw-string pants, palm beach slippers, and half glasses, Jeffrey Epstein sits at the head of the table. He spends most of his day in the dining room, remote from the world, in front of a lap top and beside a row of reading glasses (there are a lot of them in case, apparently, he misplaces a pair, but being quite meticulous he never does) advising, or instructing, a startling collection of the rich and powerful, slotted in on an hourly basis. 
     The apartness of Epstein’s dining room might seem to offer some buffer in this leveled, angry age for a super rich man who attends to even more fabulously rich men (and the occasional fabulously rich women). On the other hand, with the paparazzi often posted near by, the outside world seem dangerously close too. (Once I arrived for a visit and found several police cars blocking the street and thought the worst—they’d come for Jeffrey. But it was a security detail for a controversial head of state, also visiting him.)
     His subject for the morning is “hyper wealth.” His subject is always wealth—how capital should react to the given global political, economic, and cultural moment. The otherwise baronial dining room is disturbed by an ever-present white board, on which he scribbles calculations and notes, conducting perhaps the world’s most rarified economics class, often to many of the world’s finance ministers and foremost economists. 
     Epstein’s apartness or parallel life reflects much of the other-worldly characteristics of the wealth revolution that began in the late 1970s and that continued through the Wall Street boom of the 80s, the tech boom of the 90s—surviving, to often bitter attack, the banking crisis—and that has now seen the emergence of the international billionaire and oligarch class. 
     Epstein’s way to riches was to become a canny student of such wealth as it’s grown to an unanticipated and disruptive scale. His stock in trade is not precisely the making of money, but the issues that arise when money, at a heretofore unimaginable rate, makes itself, altering many basic economic, social and personal calculations. 
     He recounts a dinner he had two nights before. It is, like much of what he does, a conspiracist’s fantasy. The six men at this dinner, all technology entrepreneurs, represented, together, several hundred billion dollars. 
     “In the past, only governments had this kind of money,” says Epstein making something of a pedagogical point, “money of a reality altering scale. In fact, it used to be that the rich, reaching a certain point of philanthropy, merely hoped to help make the world a better place, now they want to change the world. Rockefeller and Carnegie were, as examples of social-engineering philanthropy, unique. They alone had such resources and will. Now you have legions of people who have to give away vastly larger fortunes than Rockefeller or Carnegie had at their disposal, or might even have imagined. 
     “Except that it’s actually hard to give away this kind of wealth, without unintended consequences that can cause more problems than you’re solving.” 
     Epstein’s long-time business thesis is that the rich know very little about money. They may know about their own businesses, but the great sums that are the result are an ultimate after thought and demand an entirely different sort of intellectual discipline. The Forbes 400, says Epstein, not immune to an amount of wonder, increased their wealth by $500 billion last year, meaning, in effect, that on average every Forbes-list billionaire makes more than another billion every year. And, points out the 62-year-old Epstein, they will almost all be dead in 40 years, most well before that, meaning $4.2 trillion, compounding everyday, will have to be given away. “So, to understand the future, what you have to begin to do is follow the money, not in Watergate-like terms backwards, as in who has gotten it, but forwards to where it will go and who will get it.”
     Epstein can find himself echoing aspects of Thomas Piketty on the inequities of the accumulation of wealth (“the divide is between people with assets, which appreciate, and people without assets, who fail to advance—that is, of course, the miracle of compounded interest”), except for the fact that Epstein, knowing the rich, understands a curious point that Piketty doesn’t: “Nobody, nobody, wants to give it all to their children. Everybody now has the modern appreciation that one of the curses of great wealth is that it can make your kids weird and fucked up.”
     Epstein’s position in this private allotment of a decent fraction of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product is not as philanthropist but as a higher sort of banker or guru or brain—a rich whisperer—making him, in addition to rich himself, arguably, among the most influential people you’ve never heard of. 
     Though, likely, you have heard of him, but not for his prowess with high abstraction, but for a scandal of such luridness that he is, for a great many, the poster child of the lawlessness of privilege, and for a much smaller circle, the poster child for what can happen when you become the target of a resentful world. He is that Epstein, according to the Daily Mail—among his most dogged and hyperbolic antagonists—“one of America’s most notorious sex offenders.”
     
     And yet the mighty and powerful, apparently evaluating the nature of disgrace on their own terms, beat a path to his door. It’s a fantastic conclave of influence in his dining room: financiers, billionaires, heads of state, economic ministers.
     He surely represents the kind of insiderism that is mostly just a figment in outsiders’ fantasies. Except for the fact that, straining credulity, Epstein is real. His is an ultimate sort of fantasy of power, wealth, and secrecy. (In 2004, when the then owners of this magazine put it up for sale, I was involved with a group trying to buy it—an effort in which Epstein volunteered to invest $20 million. New York was subsequently sold to another wealthy investor.) Were the International Jewish conspiracy to actually exist, it might be here in his dining room (while not everybody in his circle is Jewish, an obvious “think Yiddish” point of view prevails).
     Without ever being asked to keep what I have heard here off the record, I’ve willingly done so, least I not be invited back. And, too, to protect him. Who would understand Jeffrey? Who could explain him? 
     Certainly Epstein’s past encounters with the press (and in many ways with the entire outside world) have been about as disastrous as any could be, helping to open a Pandora’s box of lifestyle vulnerabilities that sent him to prison on a prostitution charge in 2008. 
     And yet here he is, in his 50,000 square foot mansion, dispensing advice to world leaders and business titans. 
     Indeed, Epstein has been advising Bill Gates on a new way to increase the already vast clout of the Gates Foundation by adding funds from other wealthy individuals that can use the Gates resources (the Gates Foundation now employs 1,200 people), but which can be directed to separate causes and goals. And it is Gates who at the end of the summer began prodding Epstein to begin a process of public rehabilitation.
     Hence, as part of an effort to get “out in front” of the unfavorable notice that might greet Gates’ public association with him, Epstein agreed to several on the record conversation with me, in the hope, on his part, that, after five years since his release from prison, he might be able to leaven his reputation. And with the hope on my part of learning more about how and if the rich are different than you and me (although we can fairly dispense with the if).

     Then, just before the New Year, Epstein forwarded me a heads-up email that Alan Dershowtiz, one of Epstein’s long time friends—they have a bickering brotherly relationship—and occasional legal advisors, had received from a reporter at Politico and forwarded to Epstein. The Politico reporter had been following Epstein-related court filings (there is a determined contingent of Epstein reporters) and found a new one added to an old law suit with some rather jaw-dropping claims.
     Eight years after the original suit, a Florida lawyer was now seeking to add new plaintiffs to the old case. This new filing was accompanied by allegations connecting a catch-all of bold-faced names associated with Epstein more than ten years ago, including Dershowtiz and Britain’s Prince Andrew, to a “sex slave” ring—indeed, that Epstein’s purported sex slaves had had sex with Dershowitz and the Prince at Epstein’s command. 
     This seemed to me to be merely a desperate, even comic-book, filing—just a lawyer trying to revive a dead case. I responded to Epstein that I doubted this would be seen as credible by anyone.
     Epstein, who sometimes seems to have an out-of-body attitude to his own fate and bad press, said he thought it might be “quite a show.”
     Two days later, the Daily Mail, which has become the effective ground zero in the English language for anti-privilege, and moral opprobrium (the more salacious the better), and whose editor Paul Dacre has a long time feud with Prince Andrew, put the story on its front page. (Epstein also has a long relationship with the family of disgraced press baron, Robert Maxwell, another reliable target of the British press.) Flimsy and far-fetched court filings in the U.S. by settlement-hungry plaintiffs might be discounted by skeptical U.S. reporters, but, the U.K. media, constrained by onerous rules about legal proceedings in the U.K., promptly went into tabloid frenzy (even the normally sniffy Guardian, in full anti- royal and anti- billionaire fever, joined the tabloid show) and effectively exported the story back to the U.S., where Epstein’s connection to Bill Clinton, and, hence as a shadow over Hillary, became the news. 
     “I told you,” said Epstein.
     
     There is Epstein in his inner world, trying, quite ostrich like, not to look out. Little beyond his strict realm seems palatable or even in a sense familiar to him. He’s a foreigner out here. Not too long ago, I met him for lunch in the West Village, the first time in more than ten years, he said, he’d been out to lunch in a restaurant (a not particularly pleasant experience for him and we were out in 30 minutes). 
     Then there is the outside world pressed to the glass, appalled and titillated by the monster inside the big house—a kind of Boo Radley of the Upper East Side. I have taken friends by the Epstein mansion, and the reaction to its other-worldly size in Manhattan is almost always the same: audible disbelief (everybody makes their own particular odd noise). Press accounts, seldom supplying new information, ever recycle and repeat the mysterious (and monstrous) billionaire mythology, with brief glimpses of him stepping out of the house (the same photos endlessly republished), and the assumption of depravity inside.
     In fact, the life in the house, without wife or children or conventional domestic demeanor, in some way conforms to the most scripted fantasies: a life somewhere between Daddy Warbucks and Eyes Wide Shut.
     The domesticity of the house, and the background of Epstein’s problems, centers around a group of young women who act as his support staff and companions. Some have worked for him for many years, marrying, having children, and continuing as part of his business and household infrastructure. One woman, on an afternoon when I was there, recently married, had just returned from an around the world honeymoon that Epstein had arranged for her. Some are his romantic interests. His present girl friend is in dental school. One former girlfriend, Eva Andersson Dubin, a Swedish model and Miss Universe finalist, became a doctor and married hedge funder Glen Dubin and together they finance the Dubin Breast Center at Mount Sinai Hospital. Most at one time will travel with him to his floating residences—the ranch in New Mexico, the vast apartment in Paris, the Island in the Caribbean, the house in Palm Beach. 
     This is so outside of conventional living or staffing or romantic relationships that it is hard to describe in a straightforward or straight-faced way. It sometimes seems part of Epstein’s implicit challenge: not just look at me, but do you even believe what you see? Or it seems he is just oblivious to what others are thinking. A willful and perhaps fatal tone deafness. 
     But Hefnerian prurience can also be quite businesslike: poised young women in a mansion on the Upper East Side with various office responsibilities—in some sense not that different from any of the art galleries in the surrounding neighborhood. 
     Epstein’s young women mingle freely with his powerful guests, not so much as hostess or, in tabloid language, harem-like (or as “sex slaves”), but often as attentive students (that, of course, might be regarded as having its own fetish-like attraction).
     Once, Epstein invited me to sit in on a day of presentations to him in his dining room by various “quants.” Quant theory involves making investments based solely on mathematical and statistical models. This method can often have uncanny predictive powers. But the problem is it doesn’t scale very well—the market, having discerned a pattern of successful investing, quickly copies and discounts the advantage. Epstein’s effort was to identify a dozen or so promising algorithms (each quant is effectively hawking his secret sauce algorithm) and invest up to $5 million with each. I knew paltry little about this and so rather found myself identifying with the young women to whom Epstein was explaining the basic math and mechanics—out of my league, but grateful for the lesson.
     The Epstein house/office is, by careful design, exclusive and club like, part hang out, part secret society. Along with the difficulty in explaining why, even after his jail term, the rich and powerful have yet beaten a path to his door, it’s also notable in the fixed hierarchy of who comes to whose turf, that everybody, when they went to see Epstein, comes to him.
     A week in late September, U.N. week as it happened, began, on Sunday, at Epstein’s house with a colloquial for billionaires—Gates, TK, TK, TK.  
     Epstein, preternaturally responsive to both the price of oil and to the politics of the middle of East, entertained that evening a delegation from Qatar, including Sheikh Hamad, the foreign minister. Hamad, indeed, lives across the street in a similarly furnished house—he and Epstein have the same decorator. Epstein, in his relaxed and amused demeanor, kept prodding: “Why are you financing the bad guys? What do you get out of that?” 
     The Qatarians, in some mild diplomatic discomfort, seemed most worried that their bid for the World Cup might be compromised by bribery allegations.
     At 9:00 next morning, Epstein is joined for breakfast in the dining room by Reid Weingarten, who’s represented among other fat cats in trouble, Worldcom’s Bernie Ebbers and Goldman Sach’s Lloyd Blankfein. Weingarten, horse, with a cold, and dejected, is just back from a failed defense of former Connecticut Governor John Rowland. (Epstein: “You actually believe he was getting fucked?” Weingarten: “From minute one. I’m not a virgin. But his was the worst I’ve ever seen. It was like an assassination.)
     After a short discussion of the Qartarian’s visit—Epstein is serving the chocolate, made from pistachios grown on the Shakes farm—and speculation about who actually controls ISIS, I am asked to leave the room. Twenty minutes later, after what ever business has been transacted or particular confidences, shared I am asked back in.
     “Why?” I asked Weingarten, when Epstein briefly steps out of the room, “do some many people keep coming back here, everything considered.”
     “Why we camp out here? I find that question as mysterious as you do,” says Weingarten.
     Shortly after Weingarten leaves, Epstein tells me that Eric Holder will resign by the end of the week—which he does.
     Epstein summons in the next person cooling his heels in the ante-room. It’s a young man named Brook Pierce, a former child actor, and dotcom high flyer—a principle in a gaming company called DEN, a notorious dotcom burnout, with its own sex scandal—who is now a leading investor in Bitcoin. He describe himself as the “the most active investor in the field.”
     And, indeed, is the first clear explanation I actually get about Bitcoin. It is so good that Epstein stops him and checks to see if his next appointment is here. And seconds later, Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary and President of Harvard, enters the dining room. Summers, off Diet Coke, digs deep into the Shakes chocolates, focuses in on the Bitcoin investor.
     “Okay,” he says, after listening for a bit, “I have opportunities here. But an additional feature of my decision problem roughly speaking is that the worst that could happen to you is that you could lose all the money you put into it. Whereas, I could go—I mean I don’t look that great now—but I could go from being seen as a figure of some probity and some intelligence to being a figure of much less intelligence and much less probity…”
     “Well,” says Pierce in what in some dramatic understatement, “you are going to have some low quality characters playing the space…”
That evening, there is a small cocktail party, which includes the former Prime Minister of Australian, Kevin Rudd, and Thorbjørn Jaglandthe head of the Noble Peace Prize Committee, who offers an affable, but general scathing, critique of U.S. diplomacy (and a brief defense of Obama’s Peace Prize award) and to whom Epstein offers a ride back to Europe on his jet. 
     The next morning, it’s Ehud Barack, the former Israeli Prime Minister and Israel, for breakfast. Barack is, over his omelet, able to defend both Obama and Putin. Then Kathy Ruemmler, who has just left her job as White House Counsel joins. She is already in the mix as a possible next attorney general, but, in fact, will withdraw from consideration in part to work with Epstein. 
     Larry Summers wife, Elisa New, drops by. She teaches American poetry at Harvard and is putting together a proposal for a series on poetry that WGBH in Boston may produce and Epstein is advising on where she might go for added support (he also makes mince meat of her budget). 
     MORE…TK
     
     Perhaps it’s just the ultimate feminist nightmare: Men (and a few opportunistic women) continue to come to Epstein’s because, no matter their public bows to modern manners, they simply don’t care that he offends every aspect of feminist sensibility
     Or, it’s a guilty pleasure. People who know Jeffrey exchange “Jeffrey” stories. “That’s Jeffrey,” says Mort Zuckerman, the real estate billionaire and publisher of the Daily News (ever vitriolic in its coverage of Epstein), with a twinkle in his eye and obvious enjoyment, to tales of Epstein escapades. It is an outréness that Epstein seems delighted to cultivate. In Epstein’s Paris apartment, 10,000 square feet on the Avenue Foch, a neighborhood otherwise occupied by foreign potentates, there is a stuffed baby elephant in his living room—that is, the elephant in the room. (At the same time, Epstein is a major supporter of cancer research and the elephant, he says, is also a reminder that elephants have 23 copies of tumor suppressor genes and humans have only 1.)  The single book on his bedside table is Lolita (he is, beyond the joke, a great Nobokov fan).
     Or, in a more sophisticated view, it’s a two tier understanding of the world. There is a media version of the world, which most of us live in and largely accept, and are certainly influenced by. And then there are those people who live in the media itself and therefore know that it’s mostly bunk. If the media says it, as likely some version of the opposite is true. I might guess too that for many of his visitors there’s an order of identification: there but for the grace of God. Any hyper-prominent person might, at any time, run afoul of prosecutors, the political moment, the media, or the Internet hoi polloi. 
     Epstein is the Dreyfus of the rich.
     And then there is the glue of wealth. Once, at lunch in the Epstein dinning room with Bill Richardson, the former Governor of New Mexico, and past Presidential aspirant, when Epstein left the room for a few minutes, I asked the obvious question, the one everybody asks each other, “How did you meet Jeffrey?” Richardson seemed surprised: “Jeffrey,” he said, as though stating what should have been perfectly obvious, “is the biggest landowner in New Mexico.”
     And then there is Epstein’s yet more structural explanation as to why after prison and with continuing tabloid infamy he can maintain his valued place. It comes back, not unexpectedly, to the nature or the needs of money:
     “At a certain level of finance, almost everyone is allied with an institutional interest. You are part of government, or you want to be in government, or you are connected to a bank or other portfolio, or you have key relationships with certain corporations or industries. Because of my situation, I have none of that. I have no institutional bona fides which makes me in some sense one of the few independent sources of information and actual honest brokers. That’s the usefulness of disgrace.”
     And then there is too, that he is right. Since I began working on this piece in September, Epstein predictions about the price of oil, yen, ruble, and euro have all born out. (If I had invested $100,000 the way Epstein said I should in early September, by the end of January I would have made $2.3 million. Alas, I did not.)
     And something else, which perhaps also surely accounts for Epstein’s continuing relationships with the rich and powerful: 
     Most everyone who is now of a certain age and certain ambition and certain status grew up in, and found they were temperamentally suited to, the new age of wealth that started in the late 1970s. A meritocracy on steroids, or, as Vanity Fair would baldly and ingratiatingly dub it, the new establishment, an increasingly parallel world, a self-invented one, at further and further remove from the ordinary one. In some sense, Epstein is just one version, picaresque, as well as louche, of this shared story. 
     
     He often tells, with some obvious marvel, his middle class to riches tale. He was born in 1953 in Coney Island. His father worked for the city’s Parks Department. His mother was a housewife. He has a younger brother, Mark.
      Epstein was distinguished by little other than his math talents. The captain of the math team at Lafayette High school in Bensonhurst, he goes on to Cooper Union where the tuition is free. He drops out after two years and begins taking classes at the NYU’s Courant Institute of Mathematics. Then, without a college degree, hence by a slight of hand, gets a job teaching math and physics at Dalton in 1974. (A few years ago, during a chance encounter with a former Dalton math department chairman, Margo Gumport, I asked her about Epstein. She said he was the most brilliant math teacher at Dalton in her 50-year career and that she had often wondered what had become of him.)
     It’s his first exposure to the wealthy. They have, he concludes, just as many problems as the people in Coney Island, just different ones, almost invariably involving divorce and money. “I found it interesting as a science experiment,” he recalled not long ago as we chatted about his life. “It did not really involve me. I could just stand back and watch.”
     Dalton fathers were attracted to him. Punch Sulzberger, the publisher of the New York Times, and a Dalton father at the time, tried to recruit Epstein to come to the Times. (Epstein recounts a story of riding with Sulzberger in his wood paneled station wagon to the his country estate and Sulzberger talking to the chauffer on a phone from the backseat to the front.) 
     In 1976, another Dalton father, asking “wouldn’t you rather be rich than be a teacher?” introduced him to Bear Stern’s chief Ace Greenberg, a conversation Epstein recounts as this:
     Greenberg: “Everyone tells me you’re super smart in math and you’re Jewish and you’re hungry…so why don’t you start working here tomorrow?”
     Epstein: “What?”
     Greenberg: “If your supposed to be so fucking smart, don’t you understand English?”
     Epstein: “Ok. Count me in.”
     Hence, Epstein, like many in the late 70s, arrived on Wall Street.
     As will happen to a generation of others, by the fortuitous luck of being on Wall Street at that point in time, Epstein is transformed by a new, much faster, form of upward mobility. With a facility for mathematics as well as for getting along with rich men, he transforms at an even faster rate than others being quickly transformed. 
     He moves into a new building at 66th Street and Second Avenue—still in the shadow of the Maxwell Plum era when the 60s on Second was the glamour address—a building full of “actresses, models, and euro trash.” (It would shortly become the Studio 54 era, where Epstein, who doesn’t drink or take drugs, was a regular). 
     If on one side of Wall Street there were the salesmen (the Wolf of Wall Street model), on the other side there was a new sort of finance type able to embrace a level of acute abstraction.
     “In the past,” says Epstein, “investing was all about reputations and relationships. You invested in a company on the basis of who was running it. Did they have integrity? Were they married? Good family men? It was a 50’s mentality. But in the mid 70s options started to be traded. In essence, the first formal derivatives. The movement of this instrument is not directly attached to the stock price. The world of investing began turning from relationships to math. In a sense I didn’t really make money as much as I did create it. This was intellectual activity of a fairly high order.”
     Intellectual activity aside, he meets Helen Gurley Brown and she makes him Cosmopolitan Magazine’s Bachelor of the Month in 1980.
     “What,” I ask, “was your social life like?”
     “Well, I was a playboy.”
     “That’s all? Not looking to get married?”
     “No. Never. I never wanted to get married. I wanted sex. I liked women. I wanted freedom. I was attracted to the rich because of their freedom. But I wanted also to avoid their burdens. And I didn’t want to hide. I didn’t want to be a hypocrite. I wanted to be free. I was not remotely ambivalent about what I wanted: to be free. That was the reason to make money.”
     His rise at Bear Sterns was a steep one. And he soon became the protégée of Jimmy Cayne (also hired by Ace Greenberg on a whim—he met him in a bridge game—who would go on to run Bear and to lose his fortune in Bear’s 2006 collapse). Epstein’s leave taking or ouster from Bear is the result of politics, envy, overreaching, or a securities violation, or…unclear. But, no matter, he leaves in 1982 with billionaire clients, including Marvin Davis, a real estate developer who owns Twentieth Century Fox, and Herb Seigel, a major media investor in the 1980s. Epstein is dating Morgan Fairchild, a television star in the 1980s rich-family soap operas, Dallas and Falcon Crest. 
     Now begins the Concorde phase of his life—and the Concorde phase of the 1980s. If the 80s are happening pell mell in New York, they’re happening at double time and catch up speed in London. Epstein is 30 years old and living, in Lifestyle of the Rich and Famous fashion, at English shooting parties at country estates with Saturday night black tie dinners, where he’s meeting the richest families in Europe. 
     “I don’t take it seriously,” Epstein recounts. “I’m not caught up in it. I’m not trying to make a billion dollars. There is no ultimate goal. Or its just to meet smart people, interesting people. But no long-range plans. Often no short-term plans either. I would head to Kennedy and, on the theory that most important events are serendipitous, I wouldn’t decided where I was going until I got there.”
	At the same time, he is developing a perception, or, at least a market differentiation: the hyper wealthy had different problems than the very wealthy. Dealing with a billion dollars was different from dealing with $100 million:
     “If you had a billion dollars I would think the last thing you should be worried about was money, in truth money was what you most worried about. How to make more of it, how to give away more of it, how to protect you children from it, how to hide it from your wife or husband, how to minimize your taxes on it. The traditional wealth service structure, an accountant, and investment advisor, a personal lawyer, and an idiot brother-in-law, became hopelessly outdated as amounts exponentially increased. 
	“You can’t spend a billion dollars, you can just relocate it to a different investment class. And you can’t give away a billion dollars without a vast staff, in effect going into the business of giving away money, yet another business you are likely to know little about.”
	At just about this point in the narrative, the questions or the incredulity begins in social circles and eventually in the media. He begins to acquire the major symbols of riches but does this without position, public holdings, or obvious paper trails. In essence, the formulation is, how can a person have enough money to merit increasing attention, but no clear way of having gotten it. Epstein gets stuck in that tautology. He may be rich, but he is without institutional protection or bona fides. He is a questionable substrata of wealth. He’s a freelancer.
	That’s the rub: he doesn’t work for anyone. Without institutional credentials he’s…well, nobody knows what. 
	For a period, one part of his activities he says is recovering monies for countries looted by exiled dictators or military strongmen. If early in his career he might seem like a sort of George Peppard (there’s a physical resemblance) in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, a charming hustler, later he’s George Peppard in Banacek, a smart and astute operator.
     Then, in his telling, he’s representing a series of vastly wealthy people and families. He’s not just doing their bidding or their investing, he’s helping them to imagine the ambitions of their wealth. They’ve satisfied their business dreams. Now there are the separate challenges and possibilities of their actual wealth. 
     In essence, as he becomes more public the response to this, as a function of envy and the media’s need for definition, is “bullshit.” True, there is no clear alternate narrative. No one is accusing him of anything, accept, sometimes, guilt by association. (In addition to Robert Maxwell, who will be accused of fraud, there’s Steven Hoffenberg, briefly a New York high flyer, who went to jail for a Ponzi scheme, for whom Epstein acted as a consultant.) But the characterization persist: if it’s not clear, it must be murky. Sure, Goldman Sachs partners and tech fortunes, but what to make of a Coney Island, Zelig-like no-namer? 
	In 1994, just at the moment when Prince Charles is on television acknowledging his love for Camilla Parker Bowles, Jeffrey Epstein is sitting with his arm around Princess Diana at a dinner at the Serpentine Galley in London (Diana is wearing her “revenge” dress that evening). Graydon Carter, into his second years as editor of Vanity Fair, is also at the dinner. Epstein’s rise and Carter’s rise are not, with a little critical interpretation, that different. Both are a function of the age of new money, both are helped by strategic relationships with the exceptionally wealthy (i.e. they are social climbers), both men have made themselves up. To say that Epstein, in the company of the Princess, sticks in Carter’s craw would be an understatement. Epstein becomes one of the “what do you know about him” figures in Carter’s gossip trail—a story waiting to happen. A variety of the gossip that begins to circulate about Epstein—for instance, that he secretly films his guests—is seeded by Carter, who once advised me not to go to Epstein’s house or accept a ride in his car least I risk being blackmail. (“For what?” I asked Carter. “For you have no idea,” said Carter.)
	Epstein is playing a cat and mouse game with his own growing wealth and influence. He is private and secretive, but grandly so. He joins the board of Rockefeller University. He’s suddenly on the Trilateral commission, that cabal of business people who fancy themselves, and who are fancied by conspiracy buffs, as running the world. He buys from his client Limited Founder Les Wexner the larges private house in Manhattan. (Rumors will continue for many years, that Wexner owns the house and Epstein is just squatting in it—an 18-year squat.) He buys an airplane. He buys another. He expands his holdings in New Mexico. He begins a Zanadu refurbishment of his Caribbean Island. 
     He befriends Bill Clinton in his new after-office life.
	And that’s quite the fatal pairing. 
	The post-Monica Clinton, now having pardoned the on-the-lam financier Marc Rich, is suddenly being ferried around in the jet of…who exactly?
	The New York Post is the first to take formal media note of the Clinton-Epstein connection, hinting at a sex and money bromance. The instinctively private Epstein is not just increasingly exposed, but clearly curious about the nature of exposure. 
	I met Epstein around this time. Epstein had become a more and more active backer of advanced scientific research—ultimately he will donate $30 million to Harvard for a theoretical physics research center—and in 2002 he was taking a small group of scientists out to the TED conference in Monterey. The TED organizers invited various other TED participants, including me, to join the flight. A small group assembled at the private plane terminal, most of us unfamiliar with our benefactor, and as we headed in the direction of the discrete private plans we were gently pointed to our ride: Epstein’s 727. 
	It is some thoroughly updated drawing room set-up, all of us nervously ensconced in this luxury plane, waiting for our unknown host to arrive—and soon he does, tanned, relaxed, with wide open smile, accompanied by three young women. 
     It would be unlikely, outside of a men’s magazine fantasy of the luxe life, that you could locate this in reality. Epstein’s attentions, taking time with each of his passengers, seemed impossible to account for. The quiet of the plane, engineered into acoustic perfection, seemed spooky. Epstein’s three companions were witty, poised, helpful as well as powerfully alluring—as though stewardesses of bygone times.
     (One more thing about this trip: Google founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, with their company still in its infancy, came out to see the plane and, with a few other Googlers, literally ran whopping from one end of the plan to the other. Then they described for Epstein, in what I can not now remember as a put on or entrepreneurial brainstorm, a brand extension in which they would market a line of Google bras with the Os as convenient cups. In fact, the name Google, they said, was invented out of the belief that men would focus on a word with two Os in it.)
	Not long after this trip, Epstein’s assistant called to invite me for tea at his house in New York, where Epstein, with what seemed to me little understanding of the subject, began to ask me about media—the upside, downside, and nature of media coverage. New York magazine was then soliciting him for a profile, as was Vanity Fair, who had assigned the British tabloid reporter, Vicki Ward, to the job.
	Both profiles, New York’s by Landon Thomas, pivot on the Clinton connection and detail the same quandary, how a man without clear institutional bona fides nevertheless achieves wealth and influence. Ward—who would more recently assert in the Daily Beast, that she was barred by Vanity Fair from writing about under-age sex evidence (a fact that could be read the other way: Vanity Fair, even looking to take down Epstein, did not find the evidence credible)—follows a rabbit hole of questionable contacts who might or might not have been the source or sources for Epstein’s wealth, but gets no closer to an answer, beyond confirming her own sense of dubiousness.
	Epstein, sensing that he might be exposing himself, tried to stop the process (Ward, well known for offering an operatic view about her reporting exploits, says he threatened her), called Carter and said he was having second thoughts about being a public figure.
	 “Then you should live in a two bedroom apartment in Queens,” responded Carter.

	And then the troubles began. 
     Epstein, in man-who-can-have-everything fashion, has, for many years, ordered up a daily massage following his workout sessions.
	“Often these were massage massages,” says Epstein matter of factly, “but sometimes these were happy ending massages, especially in Palm Beach, where there are many massage parlors—‘Jack Shacks,’ they’re called—that do outcalls. There was no sex. An often there was no happy ending. Often I would be on the phone for the entire massage. There were however a lot of massages and a lot of girls, with one girl recommending others.”
	It is after Epstein’s round of publicity and widely touted association with Clinton, that the mother of one of the massage parlor girls who went to Epstein’s house (most of the girls return to Epstein’s house many times) calls the police. The police interview the girl, Saige Gonzales, who then supplies names of other girls. Some of whom are found to be younger than 18.
	In the end, the police track down 18 girls—nine who are under 18; the others in their 20s and 30s; one woman is in her 60s—a number of whom give statements describing scenarios not terribly different from Epstein’s description above, except each is laid out in clinical, lurid, and near-identical detail. A cold and forceful Epstein demands that unwitting juveniles (though they have come here for this very purpose) perform repulsive (or at least repulsively described) acts on him. (Although the nature of the allegations will dramatically grow, nobody at this point alleges that he did anything to them.) 
	Epstein, tipped to the investigation, vastly raises the stakes, calling Dershowitz, who flies into Palm Beach to put the local authorities in their place—alienating Palm Beach officialdom—and, doubling down on the profile of the case. Dershowitz brings in Roy Black the famous criminal attorney who defended William Kennedy Smith in his rape trial in Palm Beach.
	Here’s the narrative: the shadowy rich man, friend of the louche and disgraced President, at all times surrounded by a retinue of gorgeous retainers doing his bidding, is now found to have gathered a network of wrong-side-of-the-tracks Palm Beach girls to provide him with weird sexual services. (It somehow reads weirder that he doesn’t have sex with them.) To boot, his former girl friend, Ghislaine Maxwell—the daughter of the disgraced Robert Maxwell—encouraged at least one of the girls to come to Epstein’s home (and forever more has become a fixture of further weird possibilities in this tale).
	Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter is reported to say: “This is bigger than Rush Limbaugh,” who, in a storm of publicity, has just been arrested in Palm Beach for possession of controlled drugs. 
	On one side are some of the nation’s most powerful defense attorneys (who, increasingly, seem more stumblebum than effective), on the other side, a round-up of hapless girls, with sensational tales of perversion and infamy (in the telling they are not so much sex workers, as Dickensian victims), relatively speaking giving the Palm Beach authorities the choice between utter capitulation to the powerful or standing on the side of the exploited and powerless.
	Still, with a critical eye, it also quite appears to be a straightforward tale of prostitution (however more or less kinky). And even though some of the girls are minors, age is not a distinguishing factor in a prostitution charge in Florida, nor in most places (in New York, for instance, at this time soliciting sex with anyone over the age of 14 is a class D misdemeanor calling for a $100 fine).
	In fact, Saige Gonzales told the police that she lied about being 18 because otherwise she knew she would not have been admitted to the house.
	The local sex crimes prosecutor, Lana Belhalevic, interviews the girls and determines that the offense is solely related to prostitution—that there are no innocent victims.
     Dershowitz rejects a series of lower-level plea deals and Palm Beach District Attorney Barry Krischer takes the unusual step of empanelling a grand jury, which returns with a recommendation of a single count of soliciting a prostitute—a charge without jail time. (And Epstein can apply to have his record expunged after a year.) 
     At which point, Reiter, the police chief, at odds with the District Attorney’s office, recruits the involvement of the FBI. This is of course the Bush-era FBI and Epstein presents quite the Clinton-connected scandal. Still, solicitation, even of a minor, is not a federal crime. The FBI hits on the novel interpretation that if Internet solicitation can be considered interstate commerce, so can telephone solicitation, permitting them to begin a deep dive investigation into Epstein’s friends, many of whom receive subpoenas and are threatened with prosecution.
     It’s all quite in the eye of the beholder: On the one end, Epstein is paying for sex acts (Epstein paid $200 for a massage with or without happy ending), on the other, he is abusing teenage girls. It’s a catch-22: How can a girl not old enough to vote be a prostitute? And yet, many girls not old enough to vote are prostitutes. 
     Compounding Epstein’s predicament, the world outside of his carefully constructed and controlled environment is someplace that he seems not just ill-equipped to handle but in which he seems to be blindly grouping about (i.e. he’s totally tone deaf). I visited him once during this time and found him weighing the conflicting advice of some of the most vaunted and egomaniacal lawyers (along with Dershowitz and Black, celebrity criminal attorney, Gerald Lefcourt, and Clinton prosecutor, Ken Starr) of the day—anyone with new advice, Epstein seemed to hire—as well as a catchall of the leading crisis managers, who he seemed to retain at will, all wrangling for fees and primacy. 
     Certainly, the upshot of his dealings with the Justice Department seem to involve a through-the-looking-glass logic. The government threatens to prosecute him (with the possibility of a 10-year sentence) and various friends, associates, and lovers, or offers an ass-backwards sort of deal in which Epstein’s lawyers have to go to the Palm Beach authorities and get them to agree to charge him with an offense that will send him to jail and get him a sex offender status. Except that a solicitation charge won’t produce that result. Therefore he has to agree also to a procurement or pimping charge (even though he has paid money, not received it—the sine qua non of pimping). What’s more, he has to agree to pay the legal fees of any of the girls who want to sue him—and, not to defend himself from their suits—forcing him to settle with each of the girls for what are reportedly high 6-figure sums or more. 
     He’s sentence to jail in 2008 for 18 months and serves 13 (while Epstein is now frequently accused of somehow managing to cut short his sentence, almost all Florida prisoners serve only 70% of their officially sentenced time).
     This hardly ends the legal catch all. Epstein's butler, Alfredo Rodriguez, steals and tries to sell an alleged journal or calendar with Epstein’s activities—but he tries to sell it to an undercover agent. Rodriguez is sentenced to 18 months in jail on a charge of theft and of withholding evidence (and a further two and half years on a related gun charge). Scott Rothstein, a lawyer whose firm represented additional girls in their suits against Epstein, also goes to jail for recruiting investors to pay for these suits on the fraudulent basis that settlements had already been reached. It’s the largest fraud in Florida history and Rothstein receives a 50-year sentence. 
     Then, Brad Edwards, Rothstein’s former partner, sues the federal government in 2008 for abridging the rights of two of the original complainants under the Crime Victim Rights Act (giving victims the right to be consulted about the disposition of their cases) regarding the Justice Departments agreement not to prosecute in favor of the state action. In 2014, Edwards tries to ad Virginia Roberts, another of the original complainants, who has previously settled with Epstein, to the long-running suit. Roberts who was paid a settlement under the original terms of Epstein’s agreement—that he would pay attorney’s fees and not oppose any law suits against him—is now trying to overturn the agreement under which she was paid, and, with Edwards, further suing Epstein for $50,000,000.
     As the most vocal of the accusers, Roberts, with the Daily Mail being her prime outlet, emerges now with what is billed as a memoir of her “sex slavery” with Epstein, written ten years after the fact. She names a number of people as being at Epstein’s Island home, including Clinton and Al Gore and his wife, who Epstein’s lawyers insists were never there—proof available through secret service records.
     The FBI is now arguing that Roberts should not be party to the suit against the government because she refused to cooperate with the government in its investigation in 2007, hence has no standing as a victim. (At the same time, the FBI included her on the list of 40 victims with whom it mandated Epstein reach a settlement.)
     It is hard to find a more hyperbolic intersection of media and lawyers then in Epstein’s case. 
     Edwards, over the six years of his law suit, tries to depose Clinton, Donald Trump, and Dershowitz—almost all of his targets coming directly from the original Vanity Fair and New York Magazine articles about Epstein.
     In addition to Prince Andrew as a British hot button, first connected to Epstein through Roberts’ interview with the Daily Mail in 2010, Clinton takes on a new role as Hillary spoiler through his connection, real or imagined, to Epstein and sex slaves.
     Almost everybody identified in any story about Epstein is approached by other media seeking to write about Epstein, often with financial incentives.
     No new details emerge. Every aspect of the current story is based on court filings describing events that may or may not have taken place prior to 2007. 
     A recent Reuters story identified a charity that Epstein has not given money to in 15 years that said if he does give again, they would give it back.
     
     The world cleanly divides, with Epstein (and friends) behind secure walls and the Mail and social media and upholders of new norms, ever more incredulous and apoplectic that Epstein not only walks free but prospers too. 	Although he has spent more than a year in jail and paid out what may be as much as $20 million, he yet seems somehow to have gotten away with it—that worst sin of all. He is the unrepentant catch all of up-to-the-minute badness: the financier whose wealth is a product of Wall Street math rather than work; a rich middle-age white man who not only parades his wealth and entitlement, but has a Peter Pan complex to boot; an insistent Playboy in a correct and prudish world; someone who somehow didn’t get the memo about vast changes in mores and culture.  
     When I suggested recently that one obvious way to blunt the animus is to get married, he said he would rather go back to jail.
     He is Calvin Harris’s song, It Was Acceptable in the 80s, come to life.
     This is all, inevitably, a Gatsby-like story. But Gatsby in New York Post and Daily Mail parlance would likely be a freaky financier too.
     And it’s a story about the limitation of journalism, in which the most compelling parts of the story—it would take a long running cable show to do justice to the meaning of Epstein’s ambitions and impulses—need to be sacrificed for not just moral certainty but for a rather preposterous fantasy of moral certainty.
     Anyway, I hope I get invited back to Jeffrey’s house.

Rationale

SPX has traded range bound since inception of the trade, still the carry has been minimal, close
out or roll the position

nwind the option post the state election event and Close position

The call vs call relative value trade is now riskier given the potential reversal in US reflation trades
and the potential for European equities to rally in a French election market-favourable outcome.
Unwind the position for the Tencent earnings

Option expired; HSCEI was up 5.1% but the SPX ended above 2200

Unwind post Mar-17 expiry; the short Sep 17 put helped reduce the hedging cost

Option expired; HSCEI stayed flat and failed to rally above the 10800 call strike

Apr17 option expired so we unwind the entire trade as planned

Unwind before May expiry following the large 4% SX5E move on 24-Apr, given lack of near term
catalysts

In Nov-16, we recommended remaining long equities with cheap hedges. The hedge expires out
of the money, while SPX has returned 8.7% for the period

The reflation trade has slowed down and the market is in a holding pattern. The long Apr-17 call
expires in-the-money, and the short Dec-17 call still has time value

The call spread still has value due to elevated vol and vol-of-vol and we collect the premium on
the expired short OTM put

The trade benefited from the rise in post-event volatility relative to pre-event volatility

The option expired
Single stock option expired in-the-money despite a 1.4% decline in the HSCEI

Single stock option expired in-the-money despite a 1.4% decline in the HSCEI
Single stock option expired in-the-money despite a 1.4% decline in the HSCEI
SX5E has rallied 23.3% since we entered the trade and European political risk abated for now

Option expired; KOSPI2 rallied 8.37% over the period

Option expired; KOSPI2 rallied 8.37% over the period
Closing the trade post French election; option strikes remain far from the spot level

Global CBD Landscape (Azer)

2

International Drug Conventions (UN)

There are three international conventions that are core to the drug control system: (1)
1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, (2) 1971 Single Convention on Psychotropic
Substances and (3) 1988 Single Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and
Psychoactive Substances.

Under the 1961 Convention, cannabis extracts and tinctures are currently classified as
Schedule | substances based on high abuse and dependence potential. Resin and herbal
cannabis are classified as Schedule IV, the most prohibitive category, including
dangerous substances that have little to no medical benefits. THC is classified as a
Schedule I! substance in the 1971 Convention. CBD does not currently have its own
scheduled class in the Conventions. Based on recent recommendations from the World
Health Organization (WHO), these classifications are likely to change in the short term.

Although the cannabis plant, as a whole, is scheduled under the conventions, there is not
a distinct separation between marijuana and hemp at the moment. However, there is an
exemption in the conventions for industrial uses of hemp, permitted there is no
potential for abuse. The language in the treaties is vague and has allowed member
states to interpret the conventions in a way that permits the use of hemp to fit their
national legislation. This is a principle based on the practice of “good faith.”

Cannabis Recommendations (WHO)

Beginning in November 2017, CBD was subject to its first pre-critical review conducted
by the WHO at the 39th meeting of the Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (ECDD).
Following the critical review of CBD at the ECDD’s 40th meeting, it was recommended
that “pure CBD should not be scheduled in the International Drug Control Conventions.”
Further clarifications were recently added outlining that CBD preparations containing
less than 0.2% THC should be removed from the drug conventions. The clarification does
not specifically mention the difference between CBD preparations derived from hemp or
marijuana. This outcome is based on expert consultations that found that CBD has no
potential for abuse or dependence. CBD will be the first cannabinoid not controlled
under international law.

The WHO also recommended that THC be removed from the 1971 Convention and listed
under Schedule |. Similarly, it recommended that herbal cannabis and resin remain
under Schedule | and removed from Schedule IV of the 1961 Convention. Extracts and
tinctures were also recommended to be removed from Schedule |. This marks a historic
decision because this was the first time cannabis has ever been subject to a critical
review conducted by the WHO.

In March 2019, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, comprised of 53 countries, will vote
on the WHO's recommendations to schedule substances. A simple majority is required.
However, it is uncertain whether the member states will vote on cannabis and its
derivatives since the WHO delayed the announcement of the recommendation by two
months. This may postpone the vote until 2020.

When the vote is passed to remove pure CBD and CBD preparations, countries that
permit the use of pure CBD and preparations of CBD will not be in violation of any
international treaties. Although countries would no longer be obliged to enforce any
control on CBD, national jurisdictions may still implement measures to regulate or
prohibit CBD use.

The New Caste takes these moves, this easy slip from their keyboards and programs
to our lives, for granted. They adjust code and networks and formulas; they watch
the effects on us. They do it again. The idea that such a move is natural, comfortable
even, reveals a new and important temprament. It draws a line betweent the people
writing the code and those who are snapped about in the world they are coding.

Do you know who decided what you see when you search? Do you understand what
the data on your phone reveals about you? Who will snip at and work on your DNA?
Your children? Are you trading stocks against some invisible high-velocity
connected master who will always be one profitable nanosecond ahead of you? In
this sense, network power involves something very much like the intentional
creation of concealment. Your Internet search results, for instance, contain a sharp
tension. Yes, data from all over the planet, from all of history sits rather amazingly in
front of you. But that bit of computer code deciding what you see is engaged ina
kind of digital book burning: It’s making whole sections of knowledge invisible even
as it is unearthing an ever more precise answer for whatever question you have.
What don’t you see? - is a question that hints not only at what is left out of your
search horizon, but generally at the way in which connected systems establish
necessary gates. Part of a Seventh Sense, then, is the ability not merely to look at the
virtual world and know how it becomes insidiously real, but also to feel that all the
connected points of the real world - markets, weapons, social movements - must be
pulled upon by code and links and networks. “Any technology depended upon,” as
The Critical Engineering Manifesto, says is “both a challenge and a threat.”©? Human
experience is, we know, unboxable, uncontainable - our joy, hopes, sense of
freedom, these all defy boxing. Yet here, all around us, are containers that affect our
every choice. Who knows what happens inside all the difficult boxes?

The creeping, essential opacity of power now reveals a twisted puzzle, a really fresh
aspect of this New Caste and the revolution they are making: As much as they are in
the business of making knowledge widely and instantly available, they are also
madly black boxing our world. This breeds a sly, unintended (I think) tension with
Kant’s Enlightenment admonition to “Dare to Know.” Would you like to Dare to know
why your computer is secure? How your genetic information will be studied and
used? How encryption works? Mostly the answer to is: You can’t know. It’s too
complex - and, anyhow, if we told you it would make the whole system less secure.
There is nothing disingenuous here: You likely wouldn’t understand. It is too
complex. You'd be lost at the first turn into strange technical language, where simple
words like “object” or “edge” have specific, essential, different meanings. And telling
you would, in fact, expose you and everyone else to all sorts of risks. It’s as if we’ve
returned to that famous debate of millennia past, the one lingering between Athens
and Jerusalem: Could the world be known and atomized and understood as the
Greeks would have it? Or was mystery, inscrutability and opacity the nature of truth,

The Crooked Course XXXvV

early 2001 in the small Egyptian seaside town of Taba. They attempted, through
bilateral talks, to capitalize on the basic ideas put forward by President Clinton. In
spite of high hopes inspired by the Taba talks, hope was dashed by Israeli intransigence,
reinforced by the violent uprising across the West Bank and Gaza, as well as internal
tensions within the Palestinian leadership.

In an attempt to revive the peace process, President George W. Bush, in a speech in
the Rose Garden in June 2002, took the bold step of publicly declaring support for an
independent Palestinian state. However, he was convinced that Chairman Arafat was
an impediment to peace, due to the continuing violence against Israelis emanating
from Gaza and the West Bank. The President made further US involvement in peace
negotiations contingent upon Arafat’s removal from power, and the implementation of
democratic reforms in the Palestinian Authority’s political structure. This was consist-
ent with Prime Minister Sharon’s policies. At this time, parts of the Palestinian
leadership either passively turned a blind eye to the rise of bombings in Israel, or
discreetly encouraged it. Arafat became a pariah for several essential players and was
isolated in his Muqata headquarters in Ramallah.

Under these dire circumstances, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for a
meeting in the conference room of his executive office at United Nations’ Headquarters
in New York with the US, Russia, and the European Union. The frustration was deep
amongst all parties. Bilateral talks did not happen. Trilateral talks did not work. In
response to the breakdown of the peace process, he suggested that the four actors
coordinate a position to restart the process. The idea was to combine the political
power of the US, Russia’s credibility amongst key Arab states, the European Union’s
financial muscle, and the UN’s legitimacy in a potent new international coalition. The
UN Secretary-General coined the phrase the “Middle East Quartet” for this informal
group. The Quartet met both at principals level and at the level of special envoys.

A novel approach to the imbroglio of Middle East peacemaking was launched:
multilateral unilateralism. The concept was launched at a Quartet Envoys’ working
dinner at the Norwegian Ambassador’s residence in Herzliya (a suburb of Tel Aviv) by
US officials William Burns and David Satterfield. The idea was for the Quartet
members to collectively produce an operational peace plan to be presented to the
parties for implementation, without prior consultation. This resulted in the Quartet
peace plan, referred to as the Road Map, which was eventually presented to the parties
as an ultimatum in 2003. In other words, a unified position was imposed by a group of
third parties upon the disputants—thus, multilateral unilateralism.

The Quartet collectively submitted the text to Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud
Abbas. The US ambassador to Israel presented it to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon,
who refused to meet with the Quartet as a whole. The Palestinian side accepted the
proposals in total while the Israeli side came up with fourteen reservations.

The Oslo Accords mapped a path towards a possible peace agreement, setting up
milestones to be passed along the way, and stipulating that the ride on this bumpy road
would take five years. It did not define the end point of the journey, because the parties
were not capable of closing the gaps between their positions at the time. The 2003
Performance-Based Road Map of the Quartet was, in many ways, the paper that
concluded the Declaration of Principles of 1993, by designating the last milestone,
the establishment of a Palestinian state.

Seeing Invisible Minds

The pilots glided their plane onto the

'© The lead author is Nicholas Epley, Ph.D., a
Professor of Behavioral Science at the University

research investigates people’s ability to reason
about others’ minds, from knowing how one is
being judged by others to predicting others'

Other minds are inherently invisible.
You cannot see an attitude, smell a belief, or
touch an intention, and yet you can nevertheless
“see” these mental states in other people with
great ease. You can even see them in agents
ranging from pets to gadgets to gods. How you
are able to see other minds, and how they
become visible, matters because it marks the
difference between treating others as human
beings worthy of moral care and concern versus
treating others as objects or animals.

passengers were rescued, cold, wet, and
almost completely unharmed. Explained
one passenger, “God was certainly
looking out for us.” New Orleans Mayor
Ray Nagin offered a very different
assessment of God’s mind following the
devastating impact of Hurricane Katrina
when he explained that, “Surely God is
mad at America. Surely he’s not
approving of us being in Iraq under false
pretense. But surely he’s upset at Black
America, too.”

Depending on your own beliefs,
such statements will seem somewhere
between insane and insightful. To
psychologists, they seem impressive.
They seem impressive not because they
reveal a keen sense of causal inference,
but rather because they reveal what may
be the most impressive capacities of the
social brain—the ability to reason about,
or “to see,” what other minds see.
Introspection enables you to know your
own intentions, report on your own
thoughts, feel your own pain, and
recognize when you are feeling shame
rather than guilt. Other minds, however,
are inherently invisible. You cannot
know what it is like to be another person
on the inside because your skull gets in
the way.

The inherent invisibility of other
minds poses a major problem for hard-
nosed philosophers, who skeptically note
that people cannot infer that other minds
exist at all. Although it is surprisingly
difficult for philosophers to reject the
skeptical conclusion from the “other
minds problem,” almost everyone else
casts it aside altogether some time
around the age of five. At this point
people have developed such a strong
capacity to think about other minds that
they not only see minds in other people,
but they seem to see other minds almost
everywhere’. Gods can be caring or

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014775.txt,"Tail risk 3: China-led commodity weakness

Commodity collapse hedge: buy AUD/USD 6m 0.67 digital put

Metal and bulk commodity prices have skyrocketed in anticipation of infrastructure
spending in the US, We are wary of this rally: tax cuts are likely to be the first line of
fiscal stimulus and potentially easier to get through Congress than sizeable
infrastructure spending, which in any case will take a longer time to impact commodity
demand (allowing for supply adjustments). Perhaps most importantly, China is still the
swing factor for global commodity prices and the risks here remain to the downside.

The recent dramatic rise for China-linked bulk commodity prices, especially coal, has
been driven by a combination of supply and demand imbalances (China floods, pit
closures and inventory shortages) and an apparent rise in speculative activity in futures
markets that has already drawn attention from regulators (Chart 76). Our resource
analysts have raised forecasts but still see moderation over 2017 (Chart 77). The futures
forward curve has already moved into backwardation. We see iron ore prices back at
USD50/t in 2017 compared to a current spot price of USD74.

While global reflation might be positive for commodities, there are reasons for caution:

e We expect Chinese property investment, the most commodity-intensive sector of
the economy, to slow in 2017.

¢  Sizeable RMB depreciation would be an additional deflationary impulse for
industrial commodities.

« There will be a supply response as current prices bring uneconomic producers back
on line, admittedly with a lag.

¢ There is potential for trade friction to impact regional trade while higher US rates
are already impacting regional EM currencies. Australia is especially exposed to
intra-regional trade and resource demand from the region.

Persistent supply/demand imbalances ahead of Chinese New Year might delay
commodity weakness until after 1Q17, especially for coking coal due to a preference for
thermal coal supplies over the Chinese winter. However, the risk of a sharp reversal
beyond is worth hedging against given the demand dynamics in China, most obviously
through the AUD. While short-dated implied volatility rose following the US election, the
risk-reversal skew remains high as a percentage of implied volatility relative to G10
pairs. This suggests hedging via AUD/USD digital puts is appropriate, in our view.

Trade recommendation: Buy 6m AUD/USD 0.67 digital put, entry: 10% (spot
reference: 0.7550). Risk is global demand recovery provides support to commodity

prices.

properties could be manifested by AI systems. Rigorously studying the corpus of existing (or
hypothetical!) cognitive architectures using these ideas would be a large task, which we do not
undertake here.

In the next sections we review several hybrid architectures in more detail, focusing most
deeply on LIDA and MicroPsi which have been directly inspirational for CogPrime.

4.5.1 CLARION

Ron Sun’s CLARION architecture (see Figure 4.9) is interesting in its combination of symbolic
and neural aspects — a combination that is used in a sophisticated way to embody the distinction
and interaction between implicit and explicit mental processes. From a CLARION perspective,
architectures like Soar and ACT-R are severely limited in that they deal only with explicit
knowledge and associated learning processes.

CLARION consists of a number of distinct subsystems, each of which contains a dual rep-
resentational structure, including a “rules and chunks” symbolic knowledge store somewhat
similar to ACT-R, and a neural net knowledge store embodying implicit knowledge. The main
subsystems are:

e An action-centered subsystem to control actions;

e A non-action-centered subsystem to maintain general knowledge;

e A motivational subsystem to provide underlying motivations for perception, action, and
cognition;

e A meta-cognitive subsystem to monitor, direct, and modify the operations of all the other
subsystems.

contributed to the assault.

bottom (BDSM): A blanket term for a masochist and/or submissive. Not everyone who is
a masochist is submissive, and vice versa.

cisgendered (queer studies): A term that means not transgendered. For example,
Clarisse is a cis woman or a cisgendered woman. Here's an excellent essay by the trans
activist Asher Bauer describing why the word cisgendered” is important:

coming out (queer studies): Openly acknowledging one's sexual identity to oneself, one's
parents, one’s friends, and other parts of one's community.

dominant (BDSM): A person who enjoys being in charge during an S&M encounter.

dungeon (BDSM): Dungeons can often be split into two types: those owned and staffed
by professionals, and those owned by people who are drawn to S&M for non-monetary
reasons. There is occasionally overlap between the two groups, but often there's less
overlap than one might think. Professional BDSM is frequently banned at non-
professional dungeons, and non-professional dungeons are frequently non-profit
organizations. Indeed, many non-professional dungeons could be described as
community centers for BDSMers. They're basically centralized nodes for BDSM
support, and they may host lectures, workshops, discussion groups, public parties, or
other meetups.

enthusiastic consent (feminism): A standard for ethical sex whereby one is expected not
Just to have a consenting partner, but an enthusiastic and excited partner.

gender policing (feminism): Gender roles are defined by culture, and when a person
steps outside their gender role, that person will often be policed or attacked by other
members of the culture. For example, a USA man with long hair risks being mocked or
beaten up.

hard limit (BDSM): A strong, negative BDSM preference that is discussed ahead of
time. For example, a person who absolutely does not want to have anal sex would
describe anal sex as a hard limit. See also: soft limit.

heteronormative (queer studies): A term used to describe the cultural expectations of
normal heterosexual relationships. For example, the expectation that men are the ones
to pursue women during romantic interactions is heteronormative.

kink (BDSM): A specific preference. For example, if Clarisse enjoys being whipped,
then she has a kink for it. She could also say something like, I kink on being whipped.”

kinky (BDSM and others): A lot of BDSMers use kinky to mean into BDSM.”
However, there are some people who use the term more broadly and include practices
that aren't usually considered BDSM, such as polyamory or swing.

landmine (BDSM): An extremely sensitive psychological spot, sometimes hit
accidentally during BDSM play. This is discussed further within this book, in What
Happens After An S&M Encounter 'Gone Wrong” (part 3).

4.3 Emergentist Cognitive Architectures

Another species of cognitive architecture expects abstract symbolic processing to emerge from
lower-level “subsymbolic” dynamics, which sometimes (but not always) are designed to simu-
late neural networks or other aspects of human brain function. These architectures are typically
strong at recognizing patterns in high-dimensional data, reinforcement learning and associative
memory; but no one has yet shown how to achieve high-level functions such as abstract reason-
ing or complex language processing using a purely subsymbolic approach. A few of the more
important subsymbolic, emergentist cognitive architectures are:

e DeSTIN [ARK09a, ARCO9], which is part of CogPrime, may also be considered as an
autonomous AGI architecture, in which case it is emergentist and contains mechanisms
to encourage language, high-level reasoning and other abstract aspects of intelligent to
emerge from hierarchical pattern recognition and related self-organizing network dynamics.
In CogPrime DeSTIN is used as part of a hybrid architecture, which greatly reduces the
reliance on DeSTIN’s emergent properties.

e Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) [I06] is a hierarchical temporal pattern
recognition architecture, presented as both an AI approach and a model of the cortex. So
far it has been used exclusively for vision processing and we will discuss its shortcomings
later in the context of our treatment of DeSTIN.

e SAL [JL08], based on the earlier and related IBCA (Integrated Biologically-based Cog-
nitive Architecture) is a large-scale emergent architecture that seeks to model distributed
information processing in the brain, especially the posterior and frontal cortex and the
hippocampus. So far the architectures in this lineage have been used to simulate various
human psychological and psycholinguistic behaviors, but haven’t been shown to give rise to
higher-level behaviors like reasoning or subgoaling.

e NOMAD (Neurally Organized Mobile Adaptive Device) automata and its successors
[KE06] are based on Edelman’s “Neural Darwinism” model of the brain, and feature large
numbers of simulated neurons evolving by natural selection into configurations that carry
out sensorimotor and categorization tasks. The emergence of higher-level cognition from
this approach seems rather unlikely.

e Ben Kuipers and his colleagues [MK07, MIX08, MIXO09]have pursued an extremely innovative
research program which combines qualitative reasoning and reinforcement learning to enable
an intelligent agent to learn how to act, perceive and model the world. Kuipers’ notion of
“bootstrap learning” involves allowing the robot to learn almost everything about its world,
including for instance the structure of 3D space and other things that humans and other
animals obtain via their genetic endowments. Compared to Kuipers’ approach, CogPrime
falls in line with most other approaches which provide more “hard-wired” structure, following
the analogy to biological organisms that are born with more innate biases.

There is also a set of emergentist architectures focused specifically on developmental robotics,
which we will review below in a separate subsection, as all of these share certain common
characteristics.

Our general perspective on the emergentist approach is that it is philosophically correct
but currently pragmatically inadequate. Eventually, some emergentist approach could surely
succeed at giving rise to humanlike general intelligence — the human brain, after all, is plainly
an emergentist system. However, we currently lack understanding of how the brain gives rise
to abstract reasoning and complex language, and none of the existing emergentist systems

Given that the government is giving landlords a grace period in order to either develop
or sell land to developers, we perceive the newly approved land tax as a lever to lower
real estate prices. Ultimately, this would improve household affordability, reduce social
tensions and indirectly tackling energy subsidies as it frees up potential household
income to spend on electricity and gasoline.

Land tax could generate up to US$11bn/yr from the major urban cities

We estimate that the government could potentially collect up to US$11bn per annum of
tax related to undeveloped land in the top 5 urban Saudi cities which accommodate
more than 50% of the Saudi population. While the law will not be effective until end-
2016, we do not expect the tax proceeds to be significant early on.

embellished upon the story in The New York Daily News: nowhere in that article does it state 
either that claimed that she had sex with our client, or that she did have sex 
with him. In fact, quite the opposite, it states as follows: Nowhere in the court case or the

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012759.txt,"connection to individual nghts; we have cut out morality as the governor. This suite of transformations,
enabled by our promiscuous brain, allowed us to occupy a unique position within the animal kingdom as
large scale killers.

Chimpanzees only kill adults when there are many attackers against one victim, with the vast
majority of kills focused on individuals outside of their own group; most kills within the group are aimed
at infants, where the costs to the attacker are low. Though humans also kill members of enemy groups
when there are many against one —a pattern that is common among hunter-gatherers and other small-
scale societies — we depart from this narrow pattern in terms of numbers and the array of potential
victims. When humans kill, we go at it with many against many, one against one, and even one against
many, including as victims both those outside of our group and those within, young and old, same and
opposite sex, and mating partner and competitor.

Add the chimpanzee’s adaptive capacity for coalitionary killing to the promiscuous capacity of
the human brain, and we arrive at a uniquely aggressive species, one capable of inflicting great harm on
others in any context. Though the modern invention of scud missiles and stealth bombers undoubtedly
enriched our capacity to kill on a large scale by putting distance between killers and victims, these
weapons of mass destruction were not necessary. Today, we need only travel back a few years to 1994 to
witness the machete genocides of Rwanda, a painful memory of our capacity to wipe out close to a
million people in 100 days with hand to hand combat. This is excessive harm, enabled by our ability to
use denial to minimize the perceived costs of killing another person and to motivate the anticipated
benefits. Denial turns down the heat of killing another and turns us into callous predators.

Evolutionary changes in the connections to the brain’s reward system provided a second, cost-
offsetting step, allowing us to move into novel arenas for harming others. When an animal wins a fight,
the reward circuitry engages, providing a physiological pat on the back and encouragement for the next
round. This same circuitry even engages in anticipation of a battle or when watching winners. The
reward system is important as it motivates competitive action in situations that are costly. There is one
situation, however, where the reward system is remarkably quiet, at least in all social animals except our
own: detecting and punishing those who attempt to cheat and free-ride on others’ good will.

Punishment carries clear costs, either paid up front in terms of resources expended on physically
or psychologically attacking another, or paid at the end if the victim fights back or retaliates. These costs
can be offset if punishers and their group benefit by removing cheaters or teaching them a lesson. Among
animals, punishment is infrequently seen in vertebrates, especially our closest relatives the nonhuman
primates. When it is seen, the most common context is competition, not cooperation. Like lethal killing,
then, punishment in animals tends to be restricted to a narrow context. Like lethal killing, punishment in

animals is psychologically monogamous.

rates vol, coming this time with a depreciation in the USD (risk-off event in the US).

Potential US-China trade barriers: bullish CNH vol

The Republican clean sweep has already sparked a strong USD rally and US rates selloff,
but could put further pressure on the USDCNY exchange rate. A stronger USD by itself
adds pressure to depreciate as China still needs looser financial conditions to maintain
stability in the debt market, a relationship confirmed by the USDCNY rally following the
2015 Fed hike. With Trump’s victory, we see increased risk of a larger depreciation.

Trump publicly labeled China as a currency manipulator on multiple occasions during the
campaign, so any speculation of anti-trade policies could put significant depreciation
pressure on the Renminbi. Potential trade tariffs on Chinese exports to the US could
raise the probability of a trade war. Furthermore, Trump could encourage the Treasury
to alter its criteria for labelling currency manipulators, which could also hurt trade
relationships. Either scenario would lead to a sharp re-pricing of risk premia higher.

The Trade: Buy USDCNH 6m 7.60 call

We recommend buying a 6m USDCNH 7.60 call for 0.37% USD (off 6.9700
forward), with a target of 1% USD. USDCNH topside is now at the cheapest levels
since the August 2015 depreciation (Chart 56). The trade could benefit from either a
rally in spot as well as any increase in the risk premium between now and inauguration
on speculation of anti-trade policies. The structure appreciates significantly from
increases in volatility, which is plausible given the 300% increase in volatility in August
2015 and the 100% increase from October 2015 to February 2016. The risk to the trade
is that China increases capital controls and dampens USDCNH appreciation, which could
cause the options to expire worthless.

CA TA CHAPTER II Cannabis Science 101

As examples of the decarboxylation process, consider the changes to THCA that result from heat
and aging. If the nonpsychoactive THCA naturally present in raw cannabis is heated, it quickly decar-
boxylates into psychoactive THC; this is what commonly occurs when cannabis flower is smoked or
vaporized for its psychoactive effect. THCA may also be stored and aged to produce CBN.

Cannabinoid Boiling Points

Cannabinoids boil at temperatures lower than the temperature at which cannabis flower burns. Based
on this property, vaporizers have been developed to heat cannabis flower to a point at which its active
compounds boil and can be inhaled as vapor but at which point the flower does not combust and create
smoke. The approximate temperatures at which select cannabinoids boil and cannabis flower combusts
are shown in the following table.

Compound Boiling and
Flower Combustion Temperatures

Compound/Flower Temperature (°F)
THCA 220
CBDA 250
THC 315
CBD 355
CBN 365
Flower 450

Smoking cannabis flower remains the most popular form of cannabis consumption, even though
it is believed to destroy as much as 30% of the active cannabinoids and is less efficient than merely
heating the desired compounds to their boiling points. Vaporizers are becoming increasingly sophisti-
cated, and those that can maintain temperatures which target the activation of specific cannabinoids
are becoming popular.

= Terpenes

Terpenes are a class of organic compounds present in cannabis and
many other plants; they are responsible for a plant’s aroma and flavor.
The strong odors produced by terpenes are believed to be part of the
natural defense of many plants. Cannabis contains more than 100 dif
ferent terpenes, which are believed to interact with cannabinoids in a
way that contributes to the medicinal benefits and therapeutic appli-
cations of cannabis. Like cannabinoids, terpenes are present in highest
concentration in the flowers of cannabis plants. (Terpenoids are certain
chemical variants of terpenes, and this report uses the general term
“terpene” to refer to both terpenes and terpenoids.)

Terpenes are believed to interact in various ways with the human

physiology: by acting on receptors and neurotransmitters, combining

to speak at those hearings does not interfere with the defendant's right to be notified of those hearings, attend those hearings,
and to speak at those hearings. Perhaps this is why the NACDL could only assert that in general victims’ rights harm
defendants - the NACDL did not provide a single supporting example.

Moreover, the procedure that the NACDL would put in place - a full evidentiary hearing with the defendant able to cross-
examine the victim to be determine victim status - is novel and unwarranted. While crime victims’ rights have existed in all
fifty states and the federal system for the last two decades, no [*964] jurisdiction has ever required anything like this. °°

Instead, procedural issues of how to determine victim status are left to the sound discretion of the trial courts.

To give a defendant an automatic right to challenge victim status raises constitutional and other problems. A defendant who
simply complained about a victim designation would lack standing under Article III of the Constitution, because there would
be no threatened or actual injury resulting from the putatively illegal action. *©8 Moreover, to give defendants free license to
cross-examine victims about whether they were truly victims would obviously create a right to discovery in a criminal case that

overlooked. >’! The victims' rights provisions in this country have never been used to give defendants new rights to question

V. Conclusion

This Article has tried to make the case for specific changes to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to protect crime
victims’ rights, particularly those rights listed in the CVRA. The Article has attempted to sketch out one way that the Rules
could be amended to do this while at the same time contending that the Advisory Committee's pending victims' rights proposals
are too restrictive. In concluding the Article, it may be useful to raise broader concerns about the Advisory Committee's
minimalist approach.

In reviewing the Advisory Committee's proposals, some might reach the conclusion that the Committee treated the victims
issue as a chore to be survived rather than an opportunity to be seized. One can read the Committee's proposals and the minutes
of its discussions without finding much enthusiasm for the idea of crime victims becoming a part of the criminal justice
process. This reluctance may be part of a larger phenomenon of hostility by the legal culture to crime victims, as other scholars
and I have argued elsewhere. *74

eCommerce To Be A Key Consumer Distribution Channel Long Term
(Blackledge)

2

A significant portion of the CBD products that are currently available fall into the
Personal Care / Beauty Products or Vitamins and Food Supplements verticals, both of
which are part of the larger Consumables category. Consumables continues to be a
highly under-penetrated eCommerce vertical in the midst of a progressive shift online,
and we see an opportunity for these CBD companies to expand online as secular
tailwinds continue to drive eCommerce growth for the larger Consumables market. For
context, we forecast overall US Consumables eCommerce sales of $51.BN in ’18, or 11%
eCommerce penetration, rising to $111BN in 23 or 19% eCommerce penetration.

Longer term, Consumables eCommerce market share, led by Amazon, should rise well
above our 19% penetration forecast in 23, as the sector favors eCommerce vs. Brick &
Mortar, for multiple reasons, namely (1) changing consumption trends, particularly with
younger demographics, who would prefer to “Skip the Trip” for these high
replenishment factor goods; and (2) rising smart speaker penetration, like AMZN's
popular Echo device, driving gains in high replenishment re-ordering.

Due to the aforementioned macro factors, we view eCommerce as a major potential
customer distribution channel for CBD longer term as consumers’ spending habits
continue to shift, and purchasing of Personal Care Products, Vitamins & Food
Supplements and other Consumable items moves online at an accelerated rate. We
expect growth within the Consumables (Personal Care, HH Goods, etc) and Food &
Beverage verticals to consistently outpace overall eCommerce growth '18-'23, resulting
in an increased share of U.S. eCommerce sales.

The Volokh Conspiracy

Eleventh Circuit rules that discovery can
move forward on my Crime Victims’ Rights
Act case

By Paul Cassell April 21

On Friday,the Ith Circuit ruled that discovery can move forward in an important Crime
Victims’ Rights Act case that my co-counsel, Brad Edwards, and I are pursuing. The narrow
issue before the court was whether prosecutors and defense attorneys could assert some sort of
“privilege” to prevent crime victims from reviewing the correspondence that lead to a plea
bargain. More broadly, the ruling means that the victims will have a chance to return to the
district court and seek to invalidate a plea agreement that (we alleged) was consummated in
violation of their rights. I hope that the case will ultimately set an important precedent that
federal prosecutors can’t keep victims in the dark about the plea deals that they reach.

Here are the important facts, taken from the 11th Circuit's opinion: The case arose in 2006, the
FBI began investigating allegations that wealthy investor Jeffrey Epstein had sexually abused
dozens and dozens of minor girls. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida
accepted Epstein’s case for prosecution, and the FBI] issued victim notification letters to my two
clients, minors Jane Doe No. | and Jane Doe No. 2, in June and August 2007. Extensive plea
negotiations ensued between the prosecutors and Epstein. On Sept. 24, 2007, the prosecutors
entered into a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein in which they agreed not to file any
federal charges against Epstein in exchange for his guilty plea to minor Florida offenses (e.g.,
solicitation of prostitution). Not only did the prosecutors neglect to confer with the victims
before they entered into the agreement with Epstein, they also concealed its existence for at least
nine months. For example, the prosecutors sent post-agreement letters to the victims reporting
that the “case is currently under investigation” and explaining that “[t]his can be a lengthy
process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough investigation.”

On June 27, 2008, the prosecutors informed my co-counse!, Brad Edwards, that Epstein planned
to plead guilty to the Florida charges three days later. But the prosecutors failed to disclose that
Epstein’s pleas to those state charges arose from his federal non-prosecution agreement and that
the pleas would bar a federal prosecution. As a result, the victims did not attend the state court
proceedings.

Within days of the election, however, there was a new source of potential
friction between us: Shimon’s future, and possibly mine, in leading our opposition
to Bibi and bringing a Labor government back to power.

The question of Peres’s leadership was unavoidable. Labor’s constitution
mandated a vote for party chairman within 14 months of an election defeat. But the
widespread assumption was that Shimon would run again. A little before midnight
on election day, with the returns beginning to show we might lose, I was invited to
a morning-after breakfast by two senior Labor ministers: Fuad Ben-Eliezer, the
man who had delivered the table-thumping warning that the hatred on the far-right
would lead to a murder, and Avraham Shochat, Finance Minister under both Rabin
and Peres. Both had been in the Knesset since the 1980s. Both were part of two of
Peres’s earlier, failed, election campaigns. Both now said that they weren’t
prepared to see him lead us into electoral battle the next time around. “Everyone in
the party understands the meaning of this defeat. Shimon is done,” Shochat said, as
Fuad nodded his agreement. “You will have to go for the leadership.”

Though their endorsement was a surprise, it would be disingenuous to pretend I
hadn’t been thinking, at some stage in the future, of running for the party
leadership. But my election-campaign differences with Ramon and Peres were not
just for the sake of intellectual argument. I badly wanted us to win: both for Peres’s
sake and the country’s, and to redeem and continue all that Yitzhak had sacrificed.
Despite my misgivings about some aspects of the Oslo process, I did believe there
was a possibility of achieving peace with the Palestinians. I knew, from my
involvement in the talks with the Syrians, that the outline of a possible peace
agreement with Assad was already in place. I frankly wasn’t confident that Bibi
was the man to lead it forward. Yes, he was smart. He was organizationally astute.
He’d been a good sayeret officer. Yet as I'd said it my TV spot, being Prime
Minister required much more than that. I was now an elected Knesset member. But
I had gone into politics in the hope of making a difference to how Israel confronted
its defining challenges of war and peace. The prospect of spending the next few as
a mere opposition foot soldier, making speeches and sitting in committee sessions,

within a real and meaningful context works a whole lot better than
shoving it down their throats and following that with a multiple
choice test. But for the vast majority of citizens, Algebra II is never
used.

There is no evidence whatsoever that says that a nation that is
trailing in math test scores will somehow trail in GDP or whatever it
is we really care about. This is just plain silly, but we keep repeating
the mantra that we are behind Korea in math as if it has been proven
that this matters in some way. Nothing of the sort has been proven.
What is true is that there are a great many vested interests that need
to keep teaching math: tutoring companies, testing companies, math
teachers, book publishers, and many others who make lots of money
when people are scared into thinking that their kid won’t get into col-
lege because he or she is bad at Algebra II. Nearly every grownup has
forgotten whatever algebra he or she ever learned to pass those silly
tests, so it is clear that algebra is meaningless for adult life. Any college
professor who is honest will tell you that algebra almost never comes
up in any college course, and when it does come up it usually needn’t
be there in the first place.

So, math isn’t important and history isn’t important. What is
important?

Tests. Tests are very important. Not to me, of course, but my vote
isn’t being counted.

The past two presidents have been obsessed with raising test scores.
I am assuming this is true because some political analysts somewhere
have determined that the general public believes in the significance of
raising tests scores and will vote for politicians who are able to show
that they have done it. There can’t be any other reason. Try taking
those tests. Most of them are available online. See how well you can
do at them.

But what could really be wrong with testing and emphasizing test
scores?

TESTING TEACHES THAT THERE ARE RIGHT ANSWERS
The problem is that in real life, the important questions don’t have an-

swers that are clearly right or wrong. “Knowing the answer” has made
school into Jeopardy. It is nice to win a game show, but important

A famous economist once said anything that can’t go on

high interest rates that stop growth, continued borrowing

The genome tests gave Ivana and Antonia the bad

Mario, is free of the disease.

Scientists classify calpainopathy, or “calpain,” as
a limb-girdle muscular dystrophy Type 2a, caused
by a mutation in the gene calpain 3, predominantly
expressed in skeletal muscle. Those who suffer from
Type 2a, such as Wrubel, Ivana, and Antonia, gener-

thigh. The weak flexors give them an awkward gait;
they swing their legs forward, landing on their toes,
and then sometimes on the sides or soles of their feet.
Some walk only on the balls of their feet. The upper
body muscle weakness creates abnormally prominent
shoulder blades.

years, explains that the disease contains many sub-

Grandmaster, analyst

Garry Kasparov is esteemed by many as the greatest chess player of all time. Now he’s engaged in a game with far higher stakes: the
preservation of democracy.

When 22-year-old Garry Kasparov became the world’s youngest chess Grand Champion, few could predict his turbulent career in chess or
as a dissident. His chessboard wizardry was already the stuff of legend when, in 1997, he made headlines when he lost a rematch to IBM’s
Deep Blue supercomputer, ushering AI into the public sphere.

Kasparov’s book Winter Is Coming details the rise of Putin’s Russia as well as Kasparov’s persecution and self-exile, and it serves chilling
warnings of reactionary forces gathering in the West. He is the chair of the Human Rights Foundation, succeeding his predecessor Vaclav
Havel.

Tim Ferriss
Human guinea pig, author

Tim Ferriss is author of The 4-Hour Workweek,” a self-improvement program of four steps: defining aspirations, managing time, creating
automatic income and escaping the trappings of the 9-to-5.

Tim Ferris brings an analytical yet accessible approach to the challenges of self-improvement and career advancement through what he
calls lifestyle design.” His 2007 book, The 4-Hour Workweek, and his lectures on productivity are stuffed with moving, encouraging
anecdotes -- often from his own life -- that show how simple decisions, made despite fears or hesitation, can make for a drastically more
meaningful day-to-day experience at work, or in life.

Word-of-blog chatter in Silicon Valley may have propelled his book to bestselling success, but Ferriss himself takes a fervid stance against
the distractions of technology toys that promote unnecessary multitasking. Following the success of his book, Ferriss has become a full-

time angel investor.

Titus Kaphar
Artist

Titus Kaphar's artworks interact with the history of art by appropriating its styles and mediums.

As Titus Kaphar says of his work: “I’ve always been fascinated by history: art history, American history, world history, individual history -
- how history is written, recorded, distorted, exploited, reimagined, and understood. In my work I explore the materiality of reconstructive
history. I paint and I sculpt, often borrowing from the historical canon, and then alter the work in some way. I cut, crumple, shroud, shred,
stitch, tar, twist, bind, erase, break, tear, and turn the paintings and sculptures I create, reconfiguring them into works that nod to hidden
narratives and begin to reveal unspoken truths about the nature of history.

His latest works are an investigation into the highest and lowest forms of recording history. From monuments to mug shots, this body of
work exhibited at Jack Shainman gallery December-Januarv 2017 seeks to collapse the line of American historv to inhabit a fixed point in

in no uncertain terms that Snowden had to be out of Hong Kong by the end of the week, or June
25

On June 19, Snowden had a meeting with Tibbo, the barrister who would handle the court
case, and Mann and Ho, the Hong Kong solicitors who had been retained for him. It took place
in a small apartment where, according to Ho, they ate pizza while they discussed Snowden’s
options.

Tibbo had a strategy for Snowden. It required that Snowden remain in Hong Kong, allow
himself to be arrested, seek bail and fight extradition in court. Tibbo said he planned to mount a
powerful legal defense against extradition by using a provision in Hong Kong’s extradition treaty
with the United States that protects fugitives from persecution on political grounds. After he told
Snowden that it would entail a long court battle, Snowden asked him if he could avoid even being
arrested.

Tibbo explained that Hong Kong courts, which closely follow British law, would certainly issue
an arrest warrant for him immediately after the US formally filed charges against him. Those
charges could come within hours, he reckoned. Soon afterwards, Snowden would be temporarily
jailed and his computers, electronic gear and thumb drives would be seized and placed in the
custody of the court. Tibbo would immediately seek his release on bail but could not guarantee
an outcome since Snowden, who had fled U.S. jurisdiction, might be considered a flight risk. If
so, Snowden could remain incarcerated during the long court battle. Even so, during the
litigation, Snowden would have a platform to make his case against US surveillance. Indeed,
Tibbo’s strategy involved building massive public support for Snowden’s cause.

Once the US government filed charges, he could further expect it would invalidate his passport
to go anywhere except for his return to the US and Interpol would issue a red alert to all its
members. Since the case involved national security secrets, the Hong Kong court might also deny
him any use of the Internet until the case was settled. If Snowden wanted to leave Hong Kong,
he had to act swiftly.

Tibbo, although evasive on the point when I interviewed him, may not have known about the
escape Harrison was planning As far as he could see, Snowden’s other alternatives were not
good. He had no money and his credit card had been blocked. He had no visas to go any other
country and Interpol would issue its own “red notice” as soon as the US filed formal charges
against him. At that point, Hong Kong airport authorities would be officially notified and could
prevent him from leaving the city. Even if he somehow got out, he would be an international
fugitive. Tibbo counseled Snowden to seek redress in the Hong Kong courts.

But Snowden had no intention of allowing himself to be arrested. Despite what he told Lana
Lam only one week earlier, at least for publication, about his determination to seek justice in the
Hong Kong courts, he had not planned to use Hong Kong as anything more than a temporary
stop over on his escape route. Two later months later and safely in Moscow, he made this point

The witting-accomplice scenario better fits with the principle in logic called Occam’s razor that
suggests that in choosing between alternative explanations, the one that requires the fewest
assumptions should be given priority. It would be a relatively easy to gain access to passwords if
Snowden had the cooperation of an insider at the center that had been read into the compartments
or, even better, if he had the cooperation with a system administrator with the necessary PKI
cards and shell keys to bypass the password protection. Such an accomplice could also help
explain how Snowden was able to get the job at the Center in the first place; how he knew in
advance that he could find there the “lists” of the NSA sources in foreign countries, and how he
knew that there were no security traps at the center. Such a witting accomplice might even have
prepared in advance the “spiders” that Snowden used to index the files.

The witting-accomplice scenario of course requires a somewhat unsettling expansion of the
plot. It means Snowden collaborated with one or more insiders at the Center to steal secret
documents. It is not difficult to imagine, in light of the lax background checks at outside
contractors servicing the NSA, that there were others in the “geek squad” that shared Snowden’s
antipathy to NSA surveillance. Certainly, we know that Snowden found other NSA workers
who were willing to attend his anti-surveillance Crypto party in December 2012. Anyone of these
other potential dissidents could have shared Snowden’s objective of exposing NSA abuses. It
would only be a small next step to offer Snowden help if he was willing to go public. Indeed, if
the geek culture produced one Snowden, why wouldn’t it produce others? If such an accomplice
lacked Snowden’s willingness to flee to another country, he may have limited his participation to
supplying technical assistance. For his part, Snowden may have agreed to divert suspicion from
his accomplice by taking sole responsibility for the crime when he went public.

The problem with this scenario, however, is that no witting accomplices were ever found. The
FBI, which was in charge of the domestic part of investigation of the Snowden case, questioned
all of Snowden’s co-workers at the Center over the course of six months but it failed to find
anyone who knowingly helped Snowden. If the accomplice was an idealistic amateur, it is likely
the FBI would have found him. Three co-workers did admit to the FBI that they might have
inadvertently given Snowden their passwords but these three slips would not account for
Snowden’s breach of all the other compartments. Of course, there may have also been less
forthcoming co-workers hid their slips in divulging their passwords to Snowden.

This raises the more sinister possibility that the accomplice was not an amateur co-worker but a
deep-cover spy who was already in place when Snowden arrived on the scene. Such a
penetration agent could have been recruited by an adversary intelligence service before Snowden
came on the scene. After Snowden expressed a desire to expose the NSA’s domestic
surveillance, it could then have used Snowden as an “umbrella” to hide its own activities. Finding
such a means to protect a source while exploiting his or her information is not uncommon in
espionage operations, and since Snowden was willing to flee America and go public, he could
serve as a near perfect umbrella. “Snowden may have carried out of the NSA many more

Harrod’s Knife Edge

Solow’s neoclassical growth model developed from ideas published a decade earlier
by Roy Harrod. Harrod had described a “warranted growth path” given by the pace
of technological innovation. He reasoned correctly that any effort to push
investment faster must soon founder in the diminishing returns foreseen by Malthus,
Ricardo and West in 1815. But how could we get investment exactly right? There
was a critical “knife edge” with little margin for error. He was right to stress the
dangers of overinvestment. I do the same. But free growth theory, and the

overwhelming evidence that it is right, bring a new perspective.

What Solow and other economists teach today , judging from the textbooks I read, is
more or less Harrod without the knife edge. We are taught to figure out the
warranted growth path, meaning the rate of technological growth, and then invest
just enough, ex ante, to exceed depreciation by that margin. But my charts and tables
show that any investment beyond depreciation recovery is deadweight loss. There is
no need to know the warranted growth path because optimum investment is nota
function of whatever it might be. Depreciation investment captures the whole of
technological growth, and further investment adds no more. It is money left on the
table. Optimum ex ante investment, at the collective scale, is depreciation

investment. Ex post results will reveal the warranted growth path.

What about Underinvestment?

One indication in the charts and tables might leave us puzzled. It is easy to

understand the futility of ex ante investment (consumption restraint) beyond

We derive a PO of SAR 24 using a DCF valuation model which we believe best captures
differing capital costs and growth profiles across the MENA region. Key assumptions are
an 11% WACC and a 2% perpetuity growth rate. Upside/downside risks to our PO are
better/worse returns from better/worse like-for-like sales and shorter/longer break even

the company's plan to add c.60% new stores by 2017. Key assumptions are: - a 5-year
CAGR in sales of 11% followed by an five-year CAGR of 6% and a perpetuity growth rate

addition, there are risks associated with a slowdown in the economy or consumer
spending.

expansions, which would result in a tighter supply of urea and effectively higher prices,
(2) Stronger demand for fertilizers and effectively prices, (3) An increase in the marginal
producer cost that effectively leads to a higher urea price floor.

Surse him hundreds of thousands of |

dollars after their failed investment
in Texas oil wells. A judge decided
Epstein owed him nothing.

“Its a bad memory. I would
rather not have ever met J effrey
Epstein,” said Michael Stroll, the
retired former president of Williams
Electronics and Sega Corp. “Suffice
it to say I have nothing good to say
about him.”

Among the characteristics most
attributed to Epstein is a penchant
for women.

He has been linked to Maxwell,
a fixture on the high-society party
circuits in both New York and Lon-
don. Previous girlfriends are said to
include a former Ms. Sweden and a
Raia model.

“He’s a lot of fun to be with,”
Donald Trump told New York maga-
zine in 2002. “It is even said that he
likes beautiful women as much as I
do, and many of them are on the
younger side. No doubt about it,
Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”

Investigation leads to Epstein

Although he was not a fre
quenter of the Palm Beach social
scene, he made his presence felt.
Among his charitable donations, he

garage, alongside a green Harley-

at Palm Beach International Airport.
At home, a private chef and a small
staff stood at the ready. From a
window in his mansion, he could
look out on the Intracoastal Water-
way and the West Palm Beach sky-
line. He seemed to be a man who -
had everything.

In March 2005, a worried mother :

ven ' WOntacted Palm Beach police. She

said another parent had overheard a
conversation between their chil-
dren.
__ Now the mother was afraid her
14-year-old daughter had been
‘ molested by a man on the island.
The phone call triggered an
extensive investigation, one that
‘ would lead detectives to Epstein but
leave them frustrated.

Palm Beach police and the state
attorney's office have declined to
discuss the case. But a Palm Beach
police report detailing the criminal
probe offers a window into what
detectives faced as they sought to
close in on Epstein.

Detectives interviewed the girl,
who told them a friend had invited
her to arich man’s house to perform
a massage. She said the friend told
her to say she was 18 if asked. At the
house, she said she was paid $300
after stripping to her panties and
massaging the man while he mas-
turbated. ;

Police interview 5 alleged victims

The investigation began in full
after the girl identified Epstein in a
photo as the man who had paid her.
Police arranged for garbage trucks

to set aside Epstein’s trash so police -

could sift through it. They set up a
video camera to record the comings
and goings at his home. They mon-
itored an airport hangar for signs of
his private jet’s arrivals and depar-
tures.

They quickly learned that the
woman who took the 14-year-old girl
to Epstein’s house was Haley Rob-
son, a Palm Beach Community Col-
lege student from Loxahatchee. Ina
sworn statement at police head-
quarters, Robson, then 18, admitted
she had taken atleast six girls to visit
Epstein, all between the ages of 14
and 16. Epstein paid her for each
visit, she said.

During the drive back to her

house, Robson told detectives, “I’m
like a Heidi Fleiss.”

Police interviewed five alleged

victims and 17 witnesses. Their
report shows some of the girls said
they had been instructed to have sex
with another woman. in front of
Epstein, and one said she had direct
intercourse with him.

In October, police searched the |

Palm Beach mansion. They discov-
ered photos of naked, young-looking
females, just as several of the girls
had described in interviews. Hidden

cameras were found in the garage |

area and inside a clock on Epstein’s

desk, alongside a girl’s high school |

transcript.

Two of Epstein’s former
employees told investigators that
young-looking girls showed up to
perform massages two or three
times a day when Epstein was in |
town.

They said the girls were permit-
ted many indulgences. A chef
cooked for them. Workers gave
them rides and handed out hun-
dreds of dollars at a time.

One employee told detectives he
was told to send a dozen.roses to one
teenage girl after a high school :
drama performance. Others were
given rental cars. One, according to -
police, received a $200 Christmas
bonus.

The cops moved to cement their
case. But as they tried to tighten the
noose, they encountered other
forces at work.

In Orlando they interviewed a
possible victim who told them noth-
ing inappropriate had happened
between her and Epstein. They
asked her whether she had spoken

to anyone else. She said yes, a pri-

vate investigator had asked her the
same questions.

When they subpoenaed one of
Epstein’s former employees, he told
them the same thing. He and a pri- |
vate eye had met ata restaurant days
earlier to go over what the man
would tell investigators.

Detectives received complaints
that private eyes were posing as
police officers. When they told
Epstein’s local attorney, Guy Frons-
tin, he said the investigators worked |
for Roy Black, the high-powered |
Miami lawyer who has defended the |
likes of Rush Limbaugh and William
Kennedy Smith.

While the private eyes were
conducting a parallel investigation,
Dershowitz, the Harvard law pro- |
fessor, traveled to West Palm Beach
with information about the girls.
From their own profiles on the pop- .
ular Web site MySpace.com, he
obtained copies of their discussions
about their use of alcohol and mari-
juana.

He took his research to a meet-
ing with prosecutors. in early 2006,
where he sought to cast doubt on the
teens’ reliability.

Nitrogen: Your natural curls

The next time you brush your hair, think of the nitrog-
enous waste that helped create it. All of your proteins,
including hair keratin, contain formerly airborne
nitrogen atoms. But the nitrogen in air is biologically
inert. For nitrogen to become a component of your
hair, it has to be converted into a more accessible form.
Nitrogen-fixing bacteria is one way that can happen.
They live among the roots of beans, peas, and other
legumes, consuming atmospheric nitrogen and releas-
ing it as ammonia, a kind of microbial manure that
fertilizes soil in which plants grow. When you eat a
plant, you consume formerly atmospheric nitrogen.

BETA PRODUCT

Every flash of lightning and every automotive spark
plug emits a puff of nitrogen oxide, which can dissolve
into raindrops and fall to earth as a form of fertilizer,
again finding its way into food webs through plants.
But most of the nitrogen in modern foods comes from
urea and ammonium nitrate fertilizers artificially fixed
by industrial processes. In ages past, the nitrogen in
human hair came mainly from bacterial waste and
lightning. But today, unless you eat a strictly organ-
ic diet, you run your hairbrush through nitrogenous
frameworks that are mostly of human origin.

Alan Dershowitz Takes The Stand: An Autobiography
Or
Taking the Stand—an Autobiography by Alan Dershowitz

Preface: Ideology as Biography—A life of continuous change

My legal practice has been described as “the most fascinating on the planet.” Though perhaps
hyperbolic, the fact is that during my long career as a lawyer, I have:

* represented and counseled presidents, prime ministers, United Nations high officials,
judges, senators, actors, musicians, athletes as well as ordinary people who have had the
most extraordinary cases;

* played a role, sometimes large, sometimes small, in some of the most cataclysmic events
of the last half century—from the assassination of JFK, to the forced resignation of
Richard Nixon, to the Chappaquiddick investigation of Ted Kennedy, to the impeachment
of President Clinton, to the war crimes trials of accused war criminals, to the defense of
Israel in international fora.

* represented some of the most despised and despicable people on the face of the earth and
sat across the table from defendants accused of mass murder, terrorism, war crimes,
torture, rape and hate crimes;

* — served as a lawyer in some of the most transforming legal cases of the age, including the
Pentagon Papers Case, the WikiLeaks investigation, the anti-war prosecutions of Dr.
Spock, the Chicago 7, the Weather Underground and Patricia Hearst;

* represented some of the most controversial defendants in recent history: OJ Simpson;
Claus Von Bulow; Mike Tyson; Leona Helmsley and Michael Milken.

This autobiography delves beneath the surface of these cases and causes. It presents an inside
account of legal events that have altered history and that continue to have a major impact on the
lives of millions of people.

What Tocqueville observed two centuries ago—that in our country nearly every great issue finds
its way into the courts—is even truer today than it was then. Accordingly, my autobiography
will, in some sense, be a history of the last half century as seen through the eyes of a lawyer who

SOME SUBJECTS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN OTHER
SUBJECTS

Yes, we have electives. But they don’t matter. Because accountability
means making sure that we first teach what does matter. What mat-
ters is the stuff that we are holding people accountable for. Since this
seems to be math and science these days, for no good reason I can
discern, this means that we will get to the stuff that would excite kids
and keep them in school, and might teach them some job skills, after
we are done with the important stuff. But I am certain that none of
the politicians mentioned in the Times article knows the quadratic
formula or the elements of the periodic table, which is, of course, the
stuff of accountability since it is so easy to test. Then how can that be
the important stuff?

ALL IMPORTANT SUBJECTS CAN BE EASILY TESTED

Yes, there are right answers in math. But are there right answers in
whether we should have invaded Iraq? No? Does that mean we can’t
teach how governments actually work and how to get reasoned argu-
ments to be heard? Is there a right speech political candidates should
make? Does that mean we can’t ask students to give speeches because
we can’t easily assess them? Do we teach only subjects for which there
are clear right answers? We do now, which is one reason why school
is a deadly experience for one and all and will remain so as long as ac-
countability is the key word in government.

SEEING WHO DID BETTER THAN WHOM IN SCHOOL IS AN
INTRINSIC PART OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS

It really is all about competition, isn’t it? Bush, both Clintons, and
Obama are all the winners of the school competition. They went to
Ivy League schools, which seems to be the real issue for most parents.
I taught at Ivy League schools and I was profoundly unimpressed
with the test- taking, grade-grubbing students I found there. The goal
of education is not to say who won, and it is not to tell Harvard
whom to admit. The goal is provide real-world skills, some of which

five-year interim period had yet to begin. In one respect, I had some sympathy for
Bibi’s predicament. The reason I'd tried to get Yitzhak to alter the terms of Oslo II
was that it required us to hand back control before we knew what a “permanent-
status” peace deal would look like. But where my sympathy ended was in how Bibi
handled the situation. Despite my concerns about the way the Oslo process had
been designed, I never doubted that killing it off would be by far a worse
alternative. Bibi had been elected to /ead Israel. Instead, he acted as if he was
playing some sort of pinball match, flipping the ball first one way, then the other,
with no obvious aim beyond keeping it in play — and, where Oslo was concerned,
simply stalling for time. Rather than setting out any vision of where he hoped to
move the negotiating process, he seemed more concerned with keeping the right-
wing of Likud and the smaller, even more extreme parties from turning against
him.

In late September 1996, Bibi and the Likud mayor of Jerusalem, Ehud Olmert,
decided to go ahead with the festive opening of an archeological tunnel that
provided access to a larger portion of the Western Wall of the ancient Jewish
temple. It was a decision that, under both Rabin and Peres, we’d delayed out of
concern about inflaming tensions with the Palestinians. As Shimon rightly said
publicly after the three days of violence that followed, we understood that, at a
minimum, it would need to be coordinated beforehand with Arafat. As the unrest
spread into the West Bank and Gaza, there were media warnings of a “new
intifada, ” the difference this time being that the Palestinians newly established
police had entered the fray. By the time urgent US diplomacy, our efforts and
Arafat’s, brought it to a close, 25 Israeli soldiers and nearly 100 Palestinians had
been killed. He did not slam the brakes altogether on the American-led efforts to
move ahead with the Oslo. In early 1997, in fact, he and Arafat reached a separate
agreement on the critically important question, and potential flashpoint, of Hebron.
It stipulated that about 80 percent of the area would be under Palestinian authority,
with Israel retaining control and responsibility for nearby settlements and key
security points. Despite right-wing and settler opposition, it was approved by a
wide margin in the Knesset, with Labor’s backing. But a few months later, in the
spring of 1997, Hamas launched a new campaign of suicide bombings in shopping
areas of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, leaving 24 people dead. While not suggesting that
Bibi took the human cost of terror lightly, he did use the attacks to drag out further
US-mediated talks on the details of implementing the Oslo I redeployments.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027916.txt,"Ahraleh Yariv, in the command post for our mission, atop a hill on the Israeli
side of the northern border.

The sun set at around seven, but we waited for darkness. It was nearly eight
when we set out. Twenty minutes later, we crossed the border. I led the way,
with Motti Nagar, Moshiko, Kuti Sharabi and, finally, Avi Telem behind. We
carried the bugging equipment and our tools in our backpacks. Avi and I had a
pair of binoculars. Mine were bulkier, but offered a slightly better view in the
darkness. Each of us had an Uzi and a pair of grenades. All our planning had
been aimed at getting on to the Golan, installing the bug and getting out again. If
all went well, no one would even know we’d been there. But we had practiced
what to do if things went wrong. If challenged or ambushed by a Syrian patrol,
we would operate by old Company A rules. We would open fire.

The climb onto the plateau wasn’t too tough, not nearly as hard as our
sayeret training treks. When we reached the top, there was no obvious sign of
any Syrians. Still, we had to move slowly. Even with my binoculars, I could see
barely 30 yards into the moonless night, and I had to scan the route ahead, back
and forth, to make sure there were none of the fences or warning signs to keep
the Syrians’ own soldiers, or unsuspecting shepherds, from a minefield. Soon,
however, we found an obviously well-used footpath which I figured was very
likely to be safe.

When we had walked a few minutes, we found ourselves going through a
tangle of bushes and reeds, some of them up to two feet high, still dry and
crackly from the summer. Aside from the risk of tripping, I knew the noise we
were making might attract attention. I told the rest of the team to hang back 20
yards behind me. I moved forward to make sure the route was clear before
signaling them to follow. I had been slightly nervous on the climb up, not so
much because I expected trouble but because there was no way of knowing
what to expect. Much as I tried to put the concerns of the generals from my
mind, I also knew that this was no ordinary mission. But almost immediately,
the nerves had gone, and I was now focused only on getting us through the next
minute, the next 20 or 30 yards of the Golan.

But as soon as we’d made it across the plateau, we ran into trouble. We
needed to cross the Banias River. On our map, I’d picked out what looked to be
a Shallow ford. But the water was much higher than we expected. After
spending 30 minutes scouting the bank for 150 yards in either direction, we
settled on what seemed to be the shallowest part. Yet we hadn’t anticipated the
need to cross a river in full flow. Worse, we’d never trained to do it. Not had we

Energy Drinks

Energy is another beverage category that we feel is ripe for CBD inclusion, as it
continues to expand towards health and wellness propositions. This has been reflected in
consistent strong growth from MNST'’s Ultra line, which offers functional benefits
without the sugar, Muscle Monster, which is high in protein, as well as the emergence of
Bang, which contains BCAA. At their recent Analyst Day, MNST indicated that they will
be launching a new product called Reign, which will offer 5x the amount of BCAA as
Bang. As the lines between core energy drinks and health and wellness offerings
continue to blur, we would expect all of the major players to come to market with
offerings that contain CBD and provide incremental functional benefits (such as muscle
recovery).

We believe that by 2020 it is reasonable for CBD’s share of the energy category to reach
~1%, which we view as conservative as it is below the current market share run rate that
Bang has already been able to achieve. A 1% share would imply revenues of ~$180 mm
for the CBD segment, assuming that the category continues to grow at the same 4.3%
CAGR it has delivered over the past three years. We can see below that implied category
revenues for total energy would grow by over $1 bn over the next two years to ~$17 bn.

Below we provide a scenario analysis on CBD energy revenues associated with market
share gains. We would note that a 0.3% share by 2020 would be at the low-end of our
expectations and result in revenues of ~$50 mm. As a point of reference, recall that
Mutant, which did not perform to expectations and has essentially been de-prioritized by
MNST, has a current market share of ~0.2%.

could have put Epstein behind bars for life.

Epstein, who counts among his friends Trump and former president Bill
Clinton, assembled a high-powered legal team to address the
allegations he faced. Ultimately, he pleaded guilty in 2008 only to state
charges of soliciting prostitution. Victims told the Herald they felt
betrayed by the arrangement.

The department’s newly announced investigation is likely to be of
limited consequence. According to Boyd's letter, it is being handled by
the Office of Professional Responsibility, which explores allegations of
employee wrongdoing. The office’s findings, at worst, typically result
in employees being fired, and they are not usually made public, though
Boyd wrote to Sasse that the office would “share the results with you
at the conclusion of its investigation as appropriate.” It is possible,
even likely, the investigation could drag on so long that Acosta, already
outside the Justice Department, would by then be out of government
entirely.

In a statement, Sasse said: “The victims of Epstein’s child sex
trafficking ring deserve this investigation — and so do the American
people and the members of law enforcement who work to put these
kinds of monsters behind bars. Parents should be grateful for the men
and women at the DOJ who are committed to transparency and

Subject: Fareed Zakaria: Trump sells America short 
Importance: High 
Fareed Zakaria: Trump sells America short 
Dear Donald Trump: China, Japan and Mexico are not killing us 
By Fareed Zakaria, Thursday, September 17, 2015 
Donald Trump's presidential bid is centered on the promise of his personal talents. He says he's the most successful 
person ever to run for the presidency, by far. (George Washington and Dwight Eisenhower, sit down!) But if there is an 
idea animating his candidacy, it is that the United States is being badly beaten by its economic competitors. In his speech 
on foreign policy this week, Trump explained that America is being bested by countries such as China, Japan and Mexico 
because their leaders are smarter, more cunning and sharper than our leaders. They're killing us, he often says. 
This is an odd moment to make these charges because the reality is almost entirely the opposite. The United States is 
more dominant on the global economic landscape than at any point since the heyday of Bill Clinton's presidency — 
perhaps even more so. 
Last quarter, the U.S. economy grew at a 3.7 percent clip. Annual growth now is almost twice that of Europe and four 
times that of Japan. Unemployment is at 5.1 percent, the lowest in seven years. The deficit as a percentage of gross 
domestic product (2.8 percent in 2014) is at its lowest since 2007. 
The U.S. has come out of the 2008 crisis better than all the others, says Ruchir Sharma, head of global macro investing 
at Morgan Stanley. Americans have reduced their debt burden more than the Europeans, while China's debt has 
skyrocketed to extremely dangerous levels. If you look outside of China, U.S. growth is actually faster even than the 
emerging markets. Since the 2008 crisis, U.S. equity markets have outperformed all others — in fact 9 out of the 10 most 
valuable companies in the world are now American. The dollar is the currency of choice. Global growth is not what it 
used to be, but in a bad neighborhood, the U.S. has the best house by far. Sharma points out that for the past four 
years, the United States' share of global GDP has increased while Europe's and Japan's have moved down. 
When I was in Europe last week, businessmen there were concerned with what they saw as a new level of U.S. 
dominance in everything from technology to entertainment to finance. Consider America's big banks. They were at the 
epicenter of the financial crisis and were badly battered by it. Since then, bankers have complained that they've faced 
uncertainty about government policies, overzealous regulators trying to compensate for their laxness before the crisis 
and the unwieldy burdens of the Dodd-Frank law. 
Well, U.S. banks today are more dominant than ever. The Wall Street Journal notes that in the past five years, JPMorgan 
Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have increased in value by $254.6 billion. In the 
same period, their European competitors, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland added 
just $9.5 billion. In July, Barclays Chairman John McFarlane was asked if America's banks were eating European lenders' 
lunch. He replied: They are doing a good job of it. He added that the U.S. banks are the only ones that really claim to 
be global and successful. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029849 
To compare the United States' performance and leadership to Mexico's, Japan's and China's is particularly ill-timed. 
Trump might be stuck in a 1980s time warp on Japan. When his The Art of the Deal was published in 1987, Americans 
were envious of Japan's brilliant leaders, who were said to be outsmarting the United States at every turn. Since then, 
Japan has become the poster child for economic stagnation and political paralysis. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been 
unwilling or unable to get his promised reforms enacted, and the country's economy continues to shrink. 
Mexico is watching its growth collapse. While its president, Enrique Pena Nieto, is a courageous and intelligent leader 
who has made some very bold decisions, he has also made some significant missteps. Most important, the country was 
ill-prepared for plunging oil prices that have battered government revenues and growth. 
China has had three decades of supercharged growth and competent government policy. But in the past few years, 
Beijing went on a borrowing binge, running up its total debt to levels that are unprecedented, according to Sharma. And 
in the past two months it has made mistakes in managing both its equity markets and currency — mistakes that have 
cost $400 billion, the Financial Times reports.

cabinet meeting the day before, by reviving an idea I’d supported under Rabin: to
build a security fence all along the edge of the West Bank, with a series of
controlled crossing points for people and goods. Yitzhak had said no at the time,
because he was worried it would be seen as a de facto border and undermine the
idea of building coexistence. My view then, and even more so now, was that we
would never get to the point of negotiating a final peace with the Palestinians
unless we could stop at least most of the terror attacks before they happened. Peres,
too, had been worried about “undermining coexistence.” But now, he and the rest
of the cabinet were so shaken by the carnage Hamas had left that they approved the
idea of a security barrier.

At our kirya meeting, hours after the latest bomb had exploded less than a mile
away, Peres recognized we had to go further. Under Oslo, we had begun giving the
Palestinians control over internal security in Gaza and parts of the West Bank.
Since the new Hamas attacks, Arafat had been saying the right things. After the
first bomb in Jerusalem, he’d phoned Shimon to offer condolences, telling
reporters afterward that this was “a terrorist operation. I condemn it completely. It
is not only against civilians, but against the whole peace process.” Yet when it
came to action, we saw no sign that he was willing, ready, or perhaps able to crack
down on the Islamist terror attacks. So Peres now announced that, if necessary in
order to detain known terrorists, we would for the first time send Israeli troops
back into areas where control had been handed back. If Arafat didn’t act, we
would.

On the political front, Peres did get some good news: President Clinton, anxious
to preserve the progress he’d worked so closely with Yitzhak to achieve, organized
an unprecedented show of international condemnation of the terror attacks. With
Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak, he co-chaired a “Summit of Peacemakers” in Sharm al-
Sheikh with the participation not just of an equally concerned King Hussein, and of
course Arafat, but leaders of Arab states from North Africa to Saudi Arabia and the
Gulf. The only significant holdout was Syria’s Hafez al-Assad. He objected
because he said the conference was too focused on Israel. As Foreign Minister, I
accompanied Shimon to the summit. A single day’s meeting was never going to
end terror. But it was unprecedented in the breadth of Arab engagement in an
initiative that, as Assad had anticipated, didn’t just condemn terror in general. It
specifically denounced the attacks being launched inside Israel.

¢ Top editors and columnists: These engagements should be informal
at the outset, and preferably at dinners, lunches and events which aren't
built around you. The focus should be on serious business and financial
journalists who are more interested to hear your opinions on the world
economy than to probe tabloid headlines. Those editors and columnists |
tend to single out are Gerald Baker and Thorold Barker at the Journal,
Lionel Barber and John Gapper at the Financial Times, Andrew Sorkin
and Hugo Lindgren at the Times, John Micklethwait and Matthew Bishop
at the Economist, Josh Tyrangiel at Businessweek, as well as a handful
of international correspondents. Ideally, the first few encounters would be
at dinners and events that we organize in New York and internationally,
which could be followed by dinners at your house in due course.

¢ International political circles: Much more is to be gained by increasing
your profile among the international political class than the domestic U.S.
political class. The global nature of your business, the importance of the
growth markets and the puritanism of American politics are good reasons
for this. In our view, you should be spending time with European, Middle
Eastern, Asian and Latin American political and business leaders — some
of which you of course already do on a daily basis but in a concerted way
through such gatherings as, the Ambrosetti Forum, the Abu Dhabi Media
Summit, Bilderberg and the BRICS Summit. | see that you are part of the
Trilateral Commission and this is in a similar vein. The advantage offered
by these gatherings over private meetings is that it demonstrates vividly
to all the other opinion leaders the unique position you occupy among the
international business elite.

Science and technology

The passion and commitment you have for supporting scientific and technological
research is extremely helpful in two ways. First, when spending time with editors
and columnists, it is important to focus their attention on areas of your choice, not
theirs. Not only is your funding of these disciplines an interesting subject, but the
special rapport that you enjoy with a number of outstanding scientists. This helps
to showcase your unique position, and acts as a powerful character reference, as
did the Alan Dershowitz quotes in your 2005 Vanity Fair profile.

Second, since it is intrinsically difficult for people to understand the nature of your
business, it is all the more important that there is an aspect of your life that is well
understood and which can be proactively communicated. Philanthropy can be the
vehicle for this, and your highly targeted philanthropy even more so, because the
impact is quantifiable. A lot can be accomplished with the science and technology
press in the first instance, who are interested in the serious side to your work and
are uninterested in the tabloid headlines.

Some of the necessary steps are:
¢ Take down the Jeffrey Epstein Science and Jeffrey Epstein Philanthropy

websites, and build a new site from scratch which explains your interests,
your past funding, the scientists you support and the breakthroughs

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012956.txt,"40 3 A Patternist Philosophy of Mind

— Example: Each time the agent builds a certain structure, it observes itself building
the structure, and its role as “builder of a tall tower” (or whatever the structure is)
becomes part of its self-model. Then when it is asked to build something new, it may
consult its selfmodel to see if it believes itself capable of building that sort of thing (for
instance, if it is asked to build something very large, its self-model may tell it that it
lacks persistence for such projects, so it may reply “I can try, but I may wind up not
finishing it”).

As we proceed through the CogPrime design in the following pages, we will see how each
of these abstract concepts arises concretely from CogPrime’s structures and algorithms. If the
theory of [Goe06a] is correct, then the success of CogPrime as a design will depend largely on
whether these high-level structures and dynamics can be made to emerge from the synergetic
interaction of CogPrime’s representation and algorithms, when they are utilized to control an
appropriate agent in an appropriate environment.

3.3 Cognitive Synergy

Now we dig a little deeper and present a different sort of “general principle of feasible general
intelligence”, already hinted in earlier chapters: the cognitive synergy principle 7, which is both
a conceptual hypothesis about the structure of generally intelligent systems in certain classes of
environments, and a design principle used to guide the design of CogPrime. Chapter 8 presents
a mathematical formalization of the notion of cognitive synergy; here we present the conceptual
idea informally, which makes it more easily digestible but also more vague-sounding.

We will focus here on cognitive synergy specifically in the case of “multi-memory systems,”
which we define as intelligent systems whose combination of environment, embodiment and
motivational system make it important for them to possess memories that divide into partially
but not wholly distinct components corresponding to the categories of:

e Declarative memory

— Examples of declarative knowledge: Towers on average are taller than buildings. I gener-
ally am better at building structures I imagine, than at imitating structures I’m shown
in pictures.

e Procedural memory (memory about how to do certain things)

— Examples of procedural knowledge: Practical know-how regarding how to pick up an
elongated rectangular block, or a square one. Know-how regarding when to approach
a problem by asking “What would one of my teachers do in this situation” versus by
thinking through the problem from first principles.

e Sensory and episodic memory

— Example of sensory knowledge: memory of Bob’s face; memory of what a specific tall
blocks tower looked like

2 While these points are implicit in the theory of mind given in [Goe06a], they are not articulated in this
specific form there. So the material presented in this section is a new development within patternist philosophy,
developed since [Goe06a] in a series of conference papers such as [Goe(9al.

demanded that newspapers publish his personal manifesto. She explained to Greenwald, “It is
going to sound crazy to some people.” Her concern was that it would detract from the credibility
of the rest of the story. Snowden had also written Greenwald a letter explain his position. “Even
the Constitution is subverted when the appetites of power demand it,” Snowden asserted, and
paraphrasing President Thomas Jefferson, he continued. “Let us speak no more of faith in man,
but bind him down from mischief by the chains of cryptography.” Snowden, showing his cult-
like faith in encryption, had “cryptography” for Jefferson’s word “constitution. Despite his
Jeffersonian rhetoric, she decided against publishing it or the Manifesto. The stolen NSA
documents were another matter. They were an enormous scoop that could have a greater impact
than the Wikileaks scoop. .She was not about to miss publishing it.

She authorized Greenwald’s trip to Hong Kong on the condition that he take with him a
Guardian staffer in whom she had confidence. He was Scottish-born Ewen MacAskill, a 61-year
old veteran journalist who had been the Washington bureau chief for the Guardian. His
assignment was to evaluate the mystery source in Hong Kong for Gibson. Greenwald accepted
her terms. Poitras, who would be accompanying them, would be paying her own way.

Snowden, for his part, had a contingency plan in place in case the Guardian failed to publish the
story. While Greenwald was negotiating with Gibson, he arranged for Micah Lee, Poitras’
associate at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, to build a personal website for him. Writing
Lee from Hong Kong under both his alias Anon108 and his real name, Snowden said that he
planned to post on it his “anti-surveillance manifesto.” He would also use it to post “a global
petition against surveillance. (A year earlier his girlfriend Mills had also asked her followers on
her “super hero” blog to sign a petition against government interference with the Internet.)
Snowden had Lee name the site “Supportonlinerights.com.” According to Lee, the website
would be build with a “dead man’s switch,” which would automatically trigger the release of NSA
documents if he was arrested. It was not clear whether Lee was doing this work as a freelancer
or in his capacity as the chief technology officer for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. After
Lee built the website for Snowden It proved unnecessary to activate it since Poitras emailed
Snowden that the Guardian had approved the trip, and she and Greenwald were booked on a
Cathay Pacific flight to Hong Kong. They would arrive on June 2, 2013,

In his preparation to go public in Hong Kong, Snowden showed himself fully capable of
orchestrating what would become a major news story. He not only picked the journalists who
would break it, but he instructed each of them as to the timing, sequence, and content of their
initial disclosures. In the security of his residence in Hong Kong, he also worked to carefully
separate the purloined NSA documents into two very different caches. I carefully evaluated
every single document I disclosed,” Snowden explained to the Guardian journalists in early June
2013. The documents in this first cache were selected to serve what he termed the “public
interest.” In the hands of journalists, these selected documents, and the story he fashioned to
accompany them, would burnish his image in the public consciousness as a whistle blower. He did

2.3.3 Newell’s Criteria for a Human Cognitive Architecture

Finally, another related perspective is given by Alan Newell’s “functional criteria for a human
cognitive architecture” [New90], which require that a humanlike AGI system should:

1. Behave as an (almost) arbitrary function of the environment

2. Operate in real time

3. Exhibit rational, i.e., effective adaptive behavior

4. Use vast amounts of knowledge about the environment

5. Behave robustly in the face of error, the unexpected, and the unknown
6. Integrate diverse knowledge

7. Use (natural) language

8. Exhibit self-awareness and a sense of self

9. Learn from its environment

10. Acquire capabilities through development
11. Arise through evolution
12. Be realizable within the brain

In our view, Newell’s criterion 1 is poorly-formulated, for while universal Turing computing
power is easy to come by, any finite AI system must inevitably be heavily adapted to some
particular class of environments for straightforward mathematical reasons [Hut05, GPI* 10].
On the other hand, his criteria 11 and 12 are not relevant to the CogPrime approach as we are
not doing biological modeling but rather AGI engineering. However, Newell’s criteria 2-10 are
essential in our view, and all will be covered in the following chapters.

2.3.4 intelligence and Creativity

Creativity is a key aspect of intelligence. While sometimes associated especially with genius-
level intelligence in science or the arts, actually creativity is pervasive throughout intelligence,
at all levels. When a child makes a flying toy car by pasting paper bird wings on his toy car, and
when a bird figures out how to use a curved stick to get a piece of food out of a difficult corner
— this is creativity, just as much as the invention of a new physics theory or the design of a new
fashion line. The very nature of intelligence — achieving complex goals in complex environments
— requires creativity for its achievement, because the nature of complex environments and goals
is that they are always unveiling new aspects, so that dealing with them involves inventing
things beyond what worked for previously known aspects.

CogPrime contains a number of cognitive dynamics that are especially effective at creating
new ideas, such as: concept creation (which synthesizes new concepts via combining aspects
of previous ones), probabilistic evolutionary learning (which simulates evolution by natural
selection, creating new procedures via mutation, combination and probabilistic modeling based
on previous ones), and analogical inference (an aspect of the Probabilistic Logic Networks
subsystems). But ultimately creativity is about how a system combines all the processes at its
disposal to synthesize novel solutions to the problems posed by its goals in its environment.

There are times, of course, when the same goal can be achieved in multiple ways — some
more creative than others. In CogPrime this relates to the existence of multiple top-level goals,
one of which may be novelty. A system with novelty as one of its goals, alongside other more

The Cops

Michele Pagan is now a sergeant for the Palm Beach Police
Department.

In early 2012, at a reception at Mar-a-Lago, Detective Joe
Recarey received the first Palm Beach Police Foundation Police
Officer of the Year award—one of several honors he received in
the course of his twenty-three-year career in Palm Beach. Two
years later, he left the department and took a job as director of
loss prevention for the Gold Coast Beverage company.

“ve been [at the Palm Beach Police Department] longer than
my children have been alive,” he told a reporter for the Palm
Beach Daily News when he left. “I’m going to miss a majority of
the people I’ve worked with, and, obviously, I'm going to miss
the work. This is my extended family. Like many families, you
have disagreements with some family members. But you over-
look that, and you work together and you're a team. I’m going to
look back and miss a lot of the people I've worked with.”

Palm Beach police chief Michael Reiter left the department in
2008 after twenty-eight years on the job. He now runs his own

security company in Palm Beach.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027902.txt,"Under army regulations, training recruits got a five-day leave every few
months during fironut. My first one came a bit later than usual, due to Rotem.
But in April 1960, shortly before the Passover holiday, I headed back to
Mishmar Hasharon. Despite my minor triumph of desert navigation, I still had
every reason to believe I’d be spending the next couple of years in an APC unit
in the Negev, and can’t pretend I was looking forward to it. Still, the idea of
returning home in my army uniform, at least a bit stronger and bulkier than
before, did give me a sense of pride.

It was on my third day back, when I was in the dining hall with a half-dozen
schoolmates-turned-soldiers, that Avraham Ramon sat down and joined us. He
was a yeled chutz, one of the “boys from outside” who had joined our class
when we were taken out of the regional high school. He, too, was now in the
army. As we were finishing lunch, he asked me: “How’s fironut?”

“Tough,” I said. “Boring.”
Smiling, he said: “How would you feel about joining a sayeret?”

The question took me by surprise. In Hebrew, sayeret meant “reconnaissance
unit”. It was the name given to special units that carried out missions behind
enemy lines, or under particularly exacting conditions. In the early 1960s, there
were only two of note. One was Sayeret Golani, attached to the Golani Brigade
near the northern border. The truly elite one was Sayeret Tzanhanim, the
paratroopers’ sayeret. It had been built from Company A of Battalion 890,
where Yigal had served in the 1950s.

“Which sayeret?” I asked.
“It’s called Sayeret Matkal,” he replied.

I’d never heard of it. When I asked what it did, he said: “I’m not allowed to
say. But are you interested?” The air of mystery made it seem only more
enticing. And no matter what it did, it had to be a step up from what lay ahead
of me in the Negev. “Yeah. Sure,” I replied.

I heard nothing further in the days after I got back to Beersheva. But at the
end of the month, I was ordered to report to a small hut in an army base near Tel
Aviv. It belonged to Maka Esser, the personnel department of military
intelligence. I was greeted by two men in their late 20s. One of them, shorter
even than me, introduced himself as Sami Nachmias. The other was tall and
slim and said in a surprisingly quiet voice: “I’m Shmil Ben-Zvi.” They were
two names which I, like most Israeli teenagers at the time, knew well. Ben-Zvi

COLLABORATIVE INSIGHTS

February 25, 2019

Given increasing interest, younger consumer demographic trends, and a lack of paid
advertising within the space, below we offer a snapshot of the Instagram landscape as a
proxy for current company social media activity. We would caveat that this is not an
exhaustive list, nor does the below chart factor in the impact of influencer marketing,
which is a popular trend in order for these companies to drive brand momentum. That
said, we believe the below chart reflects the competitive nature of the category as we
are already starting to see momentum from less known, emerging brands.

Of the companies analyzed, the below chart reflects the top 17 brands by absolute
Instagram followers, while also providing data on the absolute number of posts over the
month of January, as well as the average number of likes per post.

Absolute Followers. As it currently stands, three companies have an Instagram
following of over 100K people, with CBDFX leading the pack at 181K. Kush Queen and
GT's Kombucha also look to be well positioned with 168K and 145K followers,
respectively.

# of Posts. Blue Ridge Hemp was the most active over the month of January with 84
posts, followed closely by Hemp Bombs (79 posts) and Pure Hemp Shop (57 posts).
Across the competitive set, the average number of posts for the month of January was
32.

Avg Likes Per Post. In addition to having one of the largest number of absolute
followers, GT’s Kombucha also led the way in average likes per post (1,863). This was
followed by super premium CBD company, Lord Jones, with 1,318 average likes per
post. Not Pot rounded out the top three with 1,257 average likes per post.

We would note that while we consider the below analysis useful in terms of analyzing
social media activity, it should not be used as a proxy for market leadership. Publicly
traded companies such as Charlotte’s Web, CV Sciences and Elixinol have established
themselves as market leaders within CBD, based on distribution / market penetration,
consumer awareness, and brand equity.

Opinion and Order

CASEY, District Judge.

The Court presumes familiarity with the factual
background giving rise to this multi-district litigation. See
In re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001, 349
F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y.2005) (“Terrorist Attacks I” ).
Generally, Plaintiffs are representatives, survivors, and
insurance carriers of the victims of the attacks of
September 11, 2001, who allege, pursuant to various
theories of liability including the Antiterrorism Act
(“ATA”), 18 U.S.C. § 2331 et seq.; the Alien Tort Claims
Act (“ATCA”), 28 U.S.C. § 1350; the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”), 18
U.S.C. § 1961 et seg.; the Torture Victim Protection Act
(“TVPA”), 28 U.S.C. § 1350 note; theories of aiding and
abetting, civil conspiracy, intentional infliction of
emotional distress, negligence, survival, wrongful death,
trespass, and assault and battery, that Defendants are
responsible for those attacks as terrorists, state sponsors
of terror, or material sponsors of terror. In Terrorist
Attacks I, the Court resolved several motions to dismiss
the complaints by various Defendants. Additional motions
remain pending before the Court.

Saudi High Commission (“SHC”), HRH Prince Salman
WESTLAW

bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud (“Prince Salman”), and HRH
Prince Naif bin Abdulaziz Al—Saud (“Prince Naif’) move
to dismiss the complaints for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction pursuant to the FSIA, lack of personal
jurisdiction, and failure to state a claim for relief.
Immediately prior to the Court’s scheduled oral argument
on these motions, the Federal Plaintiffs moved to
supplement the record against Prince Salman and Prince
Naif.

Defendants Rabita Trust, Wa‘el Jalaidan, and
International Islamic Relief Organization (“IIRO”) move
to dismiss the *547 complaints for lack of personal
jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.

Other Defendants move to dismiss the complaints for
failure to state a claim. Tarik Hamdi and Abdulrahman
Alamoudi move to dismiss the Burnett and Federal
complaints. Success Foundation moves to dismiss the
Burnett complaint. The Burnett Plaintiffs denominate
certain Defendants as the “SAAR Network entities.” The
SAAR Network entities, which include African Muslim
Agency, Grove Corporate, Heritage Education Trust,
International Institute of Islamic Thought (“IIIT”),
Mar—Jac Investments, Mar-Jac Poultry, Reston
Investments, Safa Trust, and York Foundation, move to
dismiss the Burnett complaint. IIIT also moves to dismiss
the Ashton complaint. In addition to its motion to dismiss
Burnett, Mar—-Jac Poultry moves to dismiss the Ashton
and Federal complaints. The Federal Plaintiffs label
certain individuals “SAAR Network executives.” These
Defendants, including Taha Al-Awani, Muhammad
Ashraf, M. Omar Ashraf, M. Yaqub Mirza, Iqbal Unus,
and Jamal Barzinji, move to dismiss the Federal
complaint.

Finally, Defendant National Commercial Bank (“NCB”)
moves for reconsideration of this Court’s denial without
prejudice of its motions to dismiss the Ashton and Burnett
complaints. The Court resolves all the aforementioned
motions in this opinion.

I. Subject Matter Jurisdiction Under the FSIA

1 71 Pursuant to the FSIA, a foreign state and its
instrumentalities are presumed immune from this Court’s
jurisdiction unless one of the statute’s exceptions applies.
Robinson v. Gov't of Malaysia, 269 F.3d 133, 138 (2d
Cir.2001). “In contrast to a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to
dismiss for failure to state a claim, in a challenge to FSIA
subject matter jurisdiction, the defendant must present a
‘prima facie case that it is a foreign sovereign.’ ” Virtual

At the start of my brief remarks at the hotel podium before going to Rabin
Square, I had to call for quiet when I mentioned the phone call from Bibi. “No,” I
said, raising my voice to be heard above the boos, “we will not boo an incumbent
Prime Minister of Israel... A short time ago, I spoke with Prime Minister
Netanyahu and thanked him for his service to the State of Israel.” Then — with both
Leah and Shimon Peres at my side — I paid tribute to “that one special person who
had a unique role in our reaching this moment — somebody who was my
commander and guide, and the person who led me into politics: Yitzhak Rabin. I
pledged to fulfil his legacy, and complete the work he’d started. And I extended a
hand to “secular and religious, the ultra-Orthodox and the residents of the
settlements, to Israelis of Middle Eastern origin and Ashkenazi extraction, to
immigrants from Eithopia and the former Soviet Union, to the Arabs, the Druze,
the Circassians, the Bedouin. All, all of them, are part of the Israeli people.”

It was not long before sunrise when I reached the square. As the crowd shouted
and sang, I began with a line borrowed from Bob Shrum. It seemed particularly
apt: “It is the breaking of a new dawn,” I said.

But was it? As I paid tribute to Rabin — “in this place where our hearts broke” —
and dedicated myself to completing the work he’d begun, I could feel the
thousands in the square willing me on. Even in my more nuanced comments on the
talks with the Palestinians: the need to achieve peace, but at least for now by
disengaging rather than joining hands with the Palestinians, ensuring we had
military and border provisions to safeguard our security, and with the stipulation
that Jerusalem would remain our undivided capital, under Israeli sovereignty. But
some in the crowd were carrying posters saying ““No to the charedim” — the strictly
Orthodox. Others were chanting, in anticipation of the negotiations needed to put
together a coalition: Rak lo Shas! Anyone but Shas! It was a reference to the
Sephardi Orthodox party, which in addition to being more nuanced and flexible
than other religious parties on the issue of peace talks, had been the big winner in
the election. It had gained seven seats and now had only two fewer than the Likud.

I did not specifically mention Shas. But I said: “I tell you here that the time has
come to end divisions. The time has come to make peace among ourselves,
whether we are traditionalists or secularists... We must not be enemies of each
other.” Paying tribute to all those in the square who had worked for our election
victory, I added: “I know it would not have been possible without your support.
But I also know it would not have been possible without the support many in the

WC: 191694

The First Amendment has undergone more change in the past fifty years than it had in the first
170 years of its existence. Most of the changes have been for the better, such as the virtual
elimination of offensiveness as a justification for censorship, and the severe limitations placed on
defamation actions against public figures. I’m proud of the role I have played in helping bring
about these positive changes.

There are several areas, however, where the First Amendment remains in grave danger. One of
them is the use of threatened violence to impose self-censorship, if not governmental censorship.
Although the “fighting words” doctrine has always imposed a limitation on freedom of speech, it
had been considerably weakened both in theory and in practice until the recent advent of radical
Islam, with its threats to kill anyone who insults their religion or their prophet. These threats have
been accompanied by murders in several parts of the world. As a result, publishing houses have
been reluctant to include material that might give rise to threatened violence. Following the
publication by several Scandinavian newspapers of cartoons that depicted Mohammad, there were
threats of death and acts of violence. This led the Yale University Press to decide not to include
these cartoons in an academic book about the controversy. This act of censorship was not
brought about by any governmental pressure, since the First Amendment would clearly protect
the publication of the cartoons. It was brought about by the self-censorship of the publishing
house growing out of fear that publication would result in violence. This phenomenon gives those
who threaten violence an effective veto over what can be published in the United States.

The opposite side of the private self-censorship coin is the private circumvention of governmental
censorship. Private hacking groups such as “Anonymous” will do everything in their power to
thwart governmental censorship of any kind, including the use of unlawful means, even violence,
to subvert or retaliate for legitimate restrictions on publication. This means that the future battles
for freedom of speech are likely to be fought on private as well as governmental battlefields and
may well involve violent actions on all sides.

The future battlefields will also be international, since the internet respects no national boundaries.
This new phenomenon has resulted in efforts to internationalize the censorship of material deemed
offensive to Islam and other religions. Various agencies of the United Nations have proposed, in
the name of “multiculturalism,” severe restrictions on the right to criticize controversial cultural
and religious practices deemed sacred by some and offensive by others. Eternal vigilance is
essential to the preservation of rights that many Americans take for granted. The struggle for
freedom of speech—like the struggle for other liberties—never stays won.

On balance, the First Amendment remains relatively healthy and vibrant in America and continues
to serve as a model for many emerging democracies. The same cannot be said about our criminal
justice system, to which I now turn.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019620.txt,"13.2 | HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS

Angleton, a famously baroque thinker himself, impressed on me the
complexity of espionage. He said, “It’s not enough just to steal a
secret. It must be done in a way that the theft remains undetected.”

Deception is employed to obscure the nature and the extent of
the espionage theft. One of the most famous examples of this prin-
ciple was the deception used by British intelligence in World War II
to conceal its success in breaking the German ciphers generated by
the Enigma machines. If German naval intelligence had discovered
Britain was able to read the ciphers it used to communicate with its
U-boats, it would have stopped using them. So British intelligence
hid its coup by supplying false information to known German spies
to account for the sinking of U-boats, including the canard that Brit-
ish aerial cameras could detect one ingredient in the paint used to
camouflage the U-boats.

That same hoary principle of deception applies to modern-day
communications intelligence. If the Russian, Chinese, or any other
adversary intelligence service got its hands on the documents stolen
by Snowden from the NSA’s repositories in Hawaii in 2013, it would

© likely employ deception, including well-crafted lies, to create as ®
much ambiguity as possible as to the missing documents. From this
counterintelligence perspective, the intelligence issue that spawned
the great divide cannot be resolved by accepting the uncorroborated
statements made by a source, such as Snowden, who may be in the
hands of the Russian security services in Moscow.

By the same token, the calculations made by NSA officials about
the extent of the theft are also suspect. After all, the NSA is an intel-
ligence service that often engages in secret machinations. We know
that its top officials reported to the House and Senate Intelligence
Committees, as well as the president’s national security adviser, that
Snowden compromised over one million documents. But if this was
disinformation, it is difficult to see its purpose. Inflating the extent
of the damage of the Snowden breach to the president, Congress,
and the secretary of defense obviously reflected poorly on their own
management of the NSA, and their own careers. Yet such a possibil-
ity cannot be precluded in the arcane world of intelligence.

As in any case involving the loss of state secrets, uncontested facts
remain in extremely short supply. The opinion-laden appellatives

American kids are rich, after all. Some of them just don't know it,

Then again, children do stupid things. They don’t know any
better. And St. Pierre’s trips to the house make one thing clear.

These girls are young. Really young.

We expect to benefit from the remaining 15% of any tax benefits that we actually realize and, except in connection with a change in control, we will not
make any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement until after we have directly or indirectly realized (or have been deemed to have realized) benefits

in excess of such payments. These payment obligations are obligations of Carvana Co. and not of Carvana Group. No payments were made during the year

    It’s an absurdly vast house, among the largest in Manhattan, but the dining room is grand but peaceful, creating a hermetic or stop-time sense, broken only by the household staff ferrying in time-of-day-appropriate exotic foods and beverages. 
The real world seems terribly far away, but with paparazzi often posted near by, it’s dangerously close too. Once I arrived for a visit and found several police cars blocking the street and thought the worst—they’d come for him . But it was a massive security detail for a well known head of state who had come for tea.
We met several years before he became arguably the world’s most notorious sex offender. In 2002, his plane, a meticulously appointed 727, ferried a group of people to the TED conference in Monterey. He was the mysterious and peculiarly gracious host arriving after everyone had boarded: tanned, relaxed, attentive, soliciting every guest’s story and views, and accompanied by three young women not his daughters, witty, poised, helpful, and beautiful—out of a men’s magazine fantasy of the luxe life. 
One more thing about this trip suggesting something of his unique view of the public world and what you got to see when you are near him. Google founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, with their company rising into the stratosphere, came out to see his plane on the Monterey tarmac and, with a few other Googlers, literally ran whooping from one end of the plane to the other. Then, sitting in the plane’s plush living room, they described, in what I could not be sure was a put-on or entrepreneurial brainstorm,  the future of search ..
Since that trip, and through his travails, I have often been invited to his house to participate in the conversations of the newest ideas that  often take place there. 
In sweatshirt, draw-string pants, palm beach slippers, and half glasses, Jeffrey Epstein—that Epstein, most recently embroiled in charges involved under age women ,Alan Dershowitz and Prince Andrew—spends most of his day at his dining room table in the in front of a laptop and beside a row of reading glasses (there are a lot of them in case, apparently, he misplaces a pair, but being quite meticulous he never does) conducting what must surely be the world’s most extraordinary colloquial.  Pictures on the table have Jeffrey and prime minister, princes, leading scientists.with  fidel castro next to the photo with  pope ,   I guess his attempt at levity. 
These meetings, and this lifestyle, have somehow stayed private or secret—or apart—not out of any formal or stated restrictions, but because, in some sense, it would be very hard to explain just what you’re doing there with a well known sex offender in a mouth dropping  home flaunting all moderation. 
And yet, defying  controversy , and tolerating his societal tone deafness—or shy attitude toward the zeitgeist—still so many come. Gladly. Willingly. Feeling that his invitation is frankly  quite an extraordinary privilege. 

Among his frequent guests is Bill Gates, for whom Epstein has become a friend, proposing a way to leverage the resources of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to accommodate many other fortunes, so that, Epstein explains, “you might join 10 or 20 billionaires on one giving project.”  They can leverage your unique experience and expertise in the philanthropic world and learn from your early mistakes. 
As part of a many friends encouraged effort to get “out in front” of the notice that might be expected when it was revealed the number and wide diversity of the most rarified  thinkers of our generation  that come to visit  . Epstein agreed to a limited  on-the-record conversation with me. 
His subject, on a morning in late fall, sitting at the dining room table—its humorous but baronial quality disturbed by an ever-present white board—is “hyper wealth.” His subject is always wealth—how capital , in uber amounts should react to the given new  global political, economic, and cultural moment. 
His stock in trade is not the making of money,  ( his proletariat background not withstanding ) but the issues that arise when wealth growing at a heretofore unimaginable rate, makes its entrance , altering many basic economic, social, and personal calculations. Watching his presentation recounts a math class of the mighty.  The professor at the blackboard and the students ( the titans ), still hoping they are not called upon to answer a difficult question. 
 He recounts a dinner he had two nights before. The scene is, like much of what he does, a conspiracy theorist’s fantasy—the six men at this dinner, all technology entrepreneurs, representing, together, over a  hundred billion dollars and now trying to figure out how to use  their resources in order  to help shape the world. 
Missions to Mars,   age reversal.  understanding the big bang,  teleportation , Artificial Intelligence and Synthetic Biology  are this weeks topics. 
“In the past, only governments had this kind of money, money of a truly altering scale,” says Epstein in a chipper and smoothed-out Brooklynese. “In fact, it used to be that the rich, reaching a certain point of philanthropy, merely hoped to help make the world a better place, now they want to question some basic assumptions and try change the world. Rockefeller and Carnegie were, as examples of social-engineering philanthropy, unique for their time . They alone had such resources and will. Now you have legions of people who must at some point ( hopefully before death, but eventually non the less )   transfer vastly larger fortunes than Rockefeller or Carnegie had at their disposal, or might even have imagined. 
“Except that it turns out it is  actually hard to give away this kind of wealth, without unintended negative consequences that may  cause as many problems as  you’re solving.” 
Epstein’s long-time business thesis is that the hyper rich know very little about the essence of money. They may know about their own businesses, but the great sums that are  realized as a  result are ultimately an afterthought and demand an entirely different sort of intellectual discipline. The Forbes 400, says Epstein, not immune to an amount of wonder, increased their wealth by $500 billion last year, meaning, in effect, that on average every Forbes-list billionaire makes more than another billion every year. And, points out the 63-year-old Epstein, they will almost all be dead in 50 years, most well before that, meaning $4.2 trillion, compounding everyday, will eventually willhave to be transferred to new hands . “So, to understand the future, what you have to begin to do is follow the money, not in Watergate-like terms backwards, as in who has gotten it, but forwards to where it will go and who will get it.”
Epstein can find himself echoing aspects of Thomas Piketty on the inequities of the accumulation of wealth (“the divide is between people with assets, which appreciate, and people without assets, who fail to advance—that is, of course, the miracle of compounded interest”), except for the fact that Epstein, knowing the rich, understands a point that Piketty doesn’t: “Nobody, nobody, of the hyperwealthy wants to give it all to their children. Everybody now has the modern appreciation that one of the curses of great wealth is that its burdens are in many cases  too much to handle.  One of his rules for the younger generation eventual recipients is that they all take accounting classes.  Along with a video tape of the parents discussing their views on money.  This acts as the bible for the  too often conflicts amongst following generations




Epstein’s role  in this discussion of the  private allotment of what is in fact a decent fraction of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product is not only as an experienced  philanthropist  himself but as a sort of adviser  or brain—the “ rich whisperer”—making him, in addition to his own vast wealth  ( two private islands  , one for guests ) , arguably among the most influential people you’ve only heard of for reasons that have  absolutely nothing to do with his influence. 

Epstein sometimes seems to have an out-of-body attitude toward his own fate and bad press—that’s something that occurs and there is little one can do  in  the  parallel world of the lunchbox crowd . Not long ago, when I met him for lunch in New York, he noted that he hadn’t been out to eat out  in a restaurant in ten years. It was a not particularly pleasant experience for him and we were done in 30 minutes.  ( He said he couldn’t connect with so many distractions )
On the other hand, Epstein’s life sometimes may seem part of a challenge: not just look at me, but,  even I can’t  believe what you see? But, perhaps, he is just naive  to what others are thinking: a negligent  and in a sense childish tone deafness. 
Press accounts recycle the mysterious billionaire mythology—a man of vast and unsourced riches living in a parallel world of absolute entitlement—with brief glimpses of him stepping out of the house (the same photos endlessly republished), and the assumption of wrongdoing  inside.
In fact, the life in the house, without wife or children or conventional domestic demeanor, rather conforms to the scripted fantasies: somewhere between Daddy Warbucks and Eyes Wide Shut. There is indeed a group of young women—in their twenties and thirties—who act as Epstein’s support staff and companions. Some have worked for him for many years, marrying, having children, and continuing as part of his business and household infrastructure. One woman, on an afternoon when I was there, had just returned from an around-the-world honeymoon that Epstein had arranged for her. Some are, or may have been, his romantic interests.  One former girlfriend, Eva Andersson Dubin, a Swedish model and Miss Universe finalist whom Epstein has known for more than thirty years, became  one of new yorks  top doctors—Epstein helped finance her  medical school education —She  married hedge funder Glen Dubin. Together they financed the Dubin Breast Center at Mount Sinai Hospital. 
Epstein will sometimes move a meeting in his dining room outside to Central  park—his idea of going out to lunch is a Sabrett’s hot dog—with the various young women  in the house acting as  the accompanying entourage, as though something out of an 18th-century French court.
But the Hefnerian  like attitude   can also  at the flash turn  to sharply honed financial discussion. The highly  poised young women in a mansion on the Upper East Side with various office responsibilities remind me of the various uptown   art galleries in the surrounding neighborhood. They mingle freely with his hyper powerful guests, not so much as hostesses—or, in tabloid language, harem-like “sex slaves”—but as attentive colleagues  (which, of course, might be regarded  by some as having its own fetish-like attraction). Epstein explicitly denies , and is seconded by the group that there is no sexual quid pro quo. (“If you’re sleeping someone you work with they then believe they  can come in late—that’s what Jimmy Goldsmith used to say.”) Still, the constant attendance of so many comely young women, seems so outside of conventional living or staffing or social or romantic relationships that it is hard to describe in a straightforward or non- smirky  way. And while it  has been said that it may be part of the appeal for the men who come to visit Epstein, it is as well a peculiarity for them that  they merely  put up with in order to spend time with him. 
The Epstein house/office is, by careful design, exclusive and clubby, part hang out, part secret society. Along with the fact that, even after his jail term, the rich and powerful have continued to so eagerly solicit him, it’s also notable in the fixed hierarchy of who comes to whose turf, that, when they want to see Epstein, they tend to come to him. He’s created a world and you enter it. Many arrive in weekend clothes. or as one world leader said  ,  Ah    here i can come in sweat clothes .
His conversations are less meeting-like—focused and agenda-driven—then narrative therapy . In effect: the outside world comes to Epstein’s and he eagerly solicits reports. It’s a real time newspaper, or the news you don’t read in a newspaper, market movements before they occur, geopolitics with the ultimate decision makers at the table,  the health and personal eccentricities of some world leaders, discussions in hushed tones of the next high level government appointments soon to be announced. 
It’s Sunday lunch—in his schedule from a week last fall—with Gates, Mort Zuckerman, the real estate billionaire and owner of the Daily News, and Peter Thiel, the PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor. 
That evening its Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim, the foreign minister of Qatar. Hamad lives across the street in a similarly furnished house—he and Epstein have the same decorator. (Epstein, in his relaxed and amused manner, keeps prodding: “Why are you financing the bad guys? What do you get out of that?”) 
Next morning, Epstein is joined for breakfast in the dining room by the lawyer Reid Weingarten, who’s represented, among other fat cats in trouble, Worldcom’s Bernie Ebbers and Goldman Sachs’s Lloyd Blankfein. Weingarten, hoarse with a cold, is still lamenting his failed defense of former Connecticut Governor John Rowland.  ( later to be overturned on appeal ) After a blow-by-blow of the trial, they discuss the Qatarian’s visit—Epstein served chocolate made with specialy chosen pistachios grown on the Sheikh’s farm—and speculate about who actually controls ISIS, with Weingarten arguing that the Turks are not getting enough scrutiny.  Weingarten represents Gulen , the U.S. target of the Turks, There is, in Epstein’s dining room, always an alternative version of world events—“perception versus reality,” says Epstein, “not to imply that one necessarily has greater weight than the other.” 
“Why,” I ask Weingarten, when Epstein briefly steps out of the room, “do so many people keep coming back here, everything considered.” 
“Why we camp out here? I guess because there’s truly  no other place like it.” 
Epstein summons in the next person cooling his heels in the ante-room. It’s a young man named Brock Pierce, an active investor” in Bitcoin and the programmable currency space. Epsteins  blackboard gets quickly filled with the details of the Bitcoin blockchain mathematics,
After a bit, Epstein invites his next appointment to join them: Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary and President of Harvard, off Diet Coke, digs deep into the Sheikh Hamad chocolates, then focuses in on the Bitcoin investor.
“Okay,” he says, after listening for a bit to Pierce and his update on the rapid Bitcoin price swings, “I have opportunities here. But an additional feature of my decision problem, roughly speaking, is that the worst that could happen to you is that you could lose all the money you put into it. Whereas, I could go—I mean I don’t look that great now—but I could go from being seen as a figure of some probity and some intelligence to being a figure of much less intelligence and much less probity…”
“Well,” says Pierce in seeming dramatic understatement, “ no question I expect as in any nascent business one is  going to have some low quality characters playing early in the space…”
That evening, in the Epstein dining room (he seems rarely to use the rest of the house’s 50,000 square feet), there is a small cocktail party, which includes the former Prime Minister of Australian, Kevin Rudd, and Thorbjørn Jagland, the head of the Nobel Peace Prize Committee, who offers an affable, but generally scathing, critique of U.S. diplomacy (and a brief defense of Obama’s Peace Prize award) and to whom Epstein offers a ride back to Europe on his jet. 
The next morning, it’s Ehud Barack, the former Israeli Prime Minister, for breakfast. Barack is, over his omelet, able to defend both Obama and Putin. Then a high ranking official from the Obama White House, whose name I am asked not to use. There follows the former head of the UN Security Council, Hardeep Purie, and then head of the central bank of Kazakhstan, Kairat Kelimbetov. Then Nathan Myhrvold the former chief technology office at Microsoft. Then Martin Nowak, a Professor of Biology and Mathematics and Director of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard, the institute that Epstein has funded with $30 million. Part of Nowak’s research has to do with trying to “describe cancer mathematically.” (Epstein preempts Nowak’s explanation : “Think of cancer the same way as you think of a terrorist group. The NSA has been able to thwart a great number of terrorism acts by intercepting communication signals from one terrorist to another. That same dynamic, a form of signal intelligence, of finding a terrorist in Europe, can be used to intercept communication between cancer sells. Cancer cells merely communicate in protean code rather than electronic code. If you can decode what the signals are saying you can jam those signal between terrorist calls—essentially wipe out their cell phones. Likewise if you can decode biological signals you can jam them too, that’s the holy grail.”)
Then Richard Axel, a Nobel prize winner in physiology. Then Ron Baron who has $26 billion under management in his Baron Fund. Then Josh Harris, the co-founder of Apollo Global Management ($164 billion under management) and owner of the New Jersey Devils and the Philadelphia 76ers. 

The question is why, in the face of such public flogging , with the paparazzi so near,do  the high and might still come? 
Perhaps simply that it’s intelligence of a high order. Not just market moving information, but Epstein and Summers trying to unravel the conundrum of zero interest rates, or Epstein and Noam Chomsky on memory and language, or Epstein TK…
What goes on at Epstein’s house might seem just to confirm everyone’s worst fears about power and the powerful: it’s all insider stuff. But the conversations at Epstein’s are the conversations, I suspect, that rich men dream of, but in the real world, such a buttoned-down and agenda-driven place, are actually hard to have. 
“That’s Jeffrey,” says Mort Zuckerman, (whose paper, the Daily News, is ever vitriolic in its coverage of Epstein), with a twinkle in his eye. 
On Epstein’s part, there is the wink: In his Paris apartment, 10,000 square feet on the Avenue Foch, a neighborhood otherwise occupied by foreign potentates, there is a stuffed baby elephant in his living room—that is, the elephant in the room. (Epstein says too it’s a reminder that elephants have 23 copies of cancer tumor suppressor genes and humans have only 1.)  Epstein has a yet more structural explanation as to why, after prison and with continuing tabloid infamy, he can maintain his valued place. It comes back, not unexpectedly, to the nature or the needs of money: “At a certain level of finance, almost everyone is allied with an institutional interest. You are part of government, or you want to be in government, or you are connected to a bank or other portfolio, or you have key relationships with certain corporations or industries. Because of my situation, I have none of that. I have no institutional ties which makes me in some sense one of the few wholly independent sources of advice - an actual honest broker. That I guess could be described as  the usefulness of a “colorful reputation”

In some sense, too, it is perhaps generational: Most everyone who is now of a certain age and ambition and status grew up in, and found they were temperamentally suited to, the era of wealth that started in the late 1970s. A meritocracy on steroids, or, as Vanity Fair would baldly dub it, the new establishment, an increasingly parallel world, a self-invented one, at further and further remove from the ordinary one. 
Epstein often tells his middle class to riches tale: born in 1953 in Coney Island, father worked for the city’s Parks Department, mother a housewife.
The captain of the math team at Lafayette High school in Bensonhurst, he went on to Cooper Union where the tuition is free. He dropped out after two years. Without a college degree, an unsolved mystery , he got a job teaching math and physics at Dalton in 1974. (A few years ago, during a chance encounter with a former Dalton math department chairman, Margo Gumport, I asked her about Epstein. She said he was the most brilliant math teacher at Dalton in her 50-year career and that she had often wondered what had become of him.)
Dalton fathers perhaps sensed in him a young man on the make. Punch Sulzberger, the publisher of the New York Times, and a Dalton father at the time, tried to recruit Epstein to come to the Times. (Epstein recounts a story of riding with Sulzberger in his faux wood paneled station wagon to the family’s country estate and Sulzberger talking to the chauffer on a phone from the backseat to the front.) Another Dalton father, asking “wouldn’t you rather be rich than be a teacher?” introduced him to Bear Stearn’s chief Ace Greenberg.
Hence, Epstein, like many in the late ‘70s, arrived on Wall Street. 
If on one side of Wall Street there were the salesmen (the Wolf of Wall Street model), on the other side there was a new sort of finance type able to embrace a level of acute abstraction. “In the past,” says Epstein, “investing was all about reputations and relationships. You invested in a company on the basis of who was running it. Did they have integrity? Were they married? Good family men? It was a ‘50s mentality. But in the mid ‘70s  stock options started to be traded. In essence, the first version of formal derivatives. The movement of the instrument was not directly attached to the stock price but a derivative of it. The world of investing began turning from relationships to math. In a sense I didn’t really know how to  make money , as I produced little.   I  merely tried to learn how to “create” money. 
He soon became the protégée of Jimmy Cayne (also hired by Ace Greenberg on a whim—he met him in a bridge game), who would go on to run Bear and to lose his fortune in Bear’s 2006 collapse). Epstein’s leave-taking or ouster from Bear was the result of politics, envy, overreaching, or a securities violation, or…unclear. But, no matter, when he left in 1982 he took with him billionaire clients, including Marvin Davis, a real estate developer who owns Twentieth Century Fox, and Herb Seigel, a major media investor in the 1980s. At this point, Epstein was dating Morgan Fairchild, a television star in the new mega-rich-family soap operas, Dallas and Falcon Crest. 
If the ‘80s were happening pell mell in New York, they were happening at double time and catch up speed in London. “I would head to Kennedy Airport  and, on the theory that most important events in one’s life are serendipitous, I wouldn’t decide where I was  actually going until I got there.” Thirty-year-old Epstein was living a Lifestyle of the Rich and Famous (he befriended the show’s star, Robin Leach), at English shooting parties and country estates with Saturday night black tie dinners, where he was meeting the over-the-top families of Europe. 
    At the same time, he was developing a perception, or, at least a market differentiation: the hyper wealthy had different problems than the very wealthy. Dealing with a billion dollars was different from dealing with $10 million. “The traditional wealth service structure, an accountant, and investment advisor, a personal lawyer, and an less that stellar  brother-in-law, became hopelessly outdated as amounts exponentially increased. You can’t spend a billion dollars, you can just hope to  reallocate it to  different investment classes. And you can’t give away a billion dollars without a vast staff, in effect going into a new give away  business at its core  just  another business. However one  you are likely to know little about.”
    For a period, one part of his activities, he says, was recovering  looted monies .  Then, in his telling, he was representing a series of vastly wealthy people and families—helping them to navigate the ambitions of their wealth. If they had big dreams before, it’s nothing to what they can have now. 
If early in his career he might have seemed like a sort of George Peppard (there’s a physical resemblance) in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, a charmer , later he’s George Peppard in Banacek,  smart and astute.. At just about this point in the narrative, the mystery  about Epstein began to circulate in social circles. Epstein had acquired the major symbols of wealth but without obvious position, public holdings, or overt paper trails. His is a substrata of super wealth, i.e. without institutional  establishment credentials or  academic bona fides. He’s a freelancer. That’s the rub: he’s free. i.e. doesn’t work for anyone. 
Sure, Goldman Sachs partners and tech geniuses, they might have stratospheric wealth, but what to make of a Coney Island, Zelig-like silver haired financier. 
In 1994, just at the moment when Prince Charles was on television acknowledging his love for Camilla Parker Bowles, Jeffrey Epstein was sitting with his arm around Princess Diana at a dinner at the Serpentine Galley in London (Diana wearing her “revenge” dress that evening). Graydon Carter, in his second year as editor of Vanity Fair, was also at the dinner. Epstein’s rise and Carter’s rise are not, with a little critical interpretation, that different. Both are a function of the age of new money, both are helped by strategic relationships with the exceptionally wealthy, both have made themselves up. To say that Epstein, in the company of the Princess, stuck in Carter’s craw would be an understatement. Epstein became one of the “what do you know about him” figures in Carter’s gossip trail—a story waiting to happen. Carter once advised me not to go to Epstein’s house or accept a ride in his car least I risk being put under his spell, . (“For what?” I asked Carter. “You can’t even begin to imagine,” said Carter.) 
    He joined the board of Rockefeller University. And then he was suddenly on the  Trilateral commission, that cabal of business people  who are fancied by some  conspiracy buffs, as the group running the world. He bought, from his client Limited Founder Les Wexner, the largest private house in Manhattan.   He bought an airplane. Then another. He expanded his holdings in New Mexico. He began a Xanadu-like refurbishment of his Caribbean Island and then bought the neighboring island for guests.  
He befriended Bill Clinton in his new after-office life—and that would prove to be quite the fatal pairing. 
    The post-Monica Clinton, now having pardoned the on-the-lam financier Marc Rich—at this point, before his own rehabilitation, Clinton was considered  the world’s ultimate sleaze ball—was suddenly being ferried around in the jet of…who exactly? The New York Post was the first to take formal media note of the Clinton-Epstein connection, hinting at a sex and money bromance. “I suppose travel with Clinton changed the arc of my life,” Epstein tells me. “There were, I knew, lots of obvious reasons not to do it, but having the ability to spend 100 hours with a former president just doesn’t happen to many people.”
I met Epstein around this time, on the flight out to TED. Not long after this trip, Epstein’s assistant called to invite me for tea at his house in New York, where Epstein, with what seemed to me a dearth of understanding of the subject, began to ask me about detailed and focused questions re  media—the upside, downside, and nature of media coverage. (Epstein’s very brief flirtation with the media would result in his backing an unsuccessful effort, of which I was a part, to buy New York Magazine in 2004.)
New York magazine was then soliciting him for a profile, as was Vanity Fair, who had assigned the British tabloid journalist, Vicki Ward, to the job. Both profiles—New York’s by Landon Thomas—pivot on the Clinton connection and detail the same quandary, how a man without clear institutional bona fides nevertheless achieved such magnificent wealth and  substainal influence. Epstein, sensing that he might be exposing himself, called Carter and said he was having second thoughts about being a public figure.
    “Then you should have lived in a two bedroom apartment in Queens,” responded Carter.
     And then the real troubles began. Epstein had a prodigious massage parlor outcall habit especially in Palm Beach with its many “Jack Shacks.” After Epstein’s round of publicity and widely touted association with Clinton, the stepmother of one of the massage parlor girls who went to Epstein’s house called the police. The police interviewed the girl—who was TK at the time, but whose website identified her as 18—and the girl supplied the names of other girls, some of whom were also younger than 18.
    In the end, the police tracked down 18 girls—nine of whom were under 18; the others were in their 20s and 30s (one woman was in her 60s)—a number of whom gave statements describing happy-ending massages. (Although the nature of the allegations will dramatically grow into threesomes and forced sexual encounters, nobody at this point alleged anything more than this.)  
Epstein called in Dershowitz, who flew into Palm Beach to put the local authorities in their place—alienating Palm Beach officialdom—and, further amping up the profile of the case, also brought in Roy Black, the famous criminal attorney who defended William Kennedy Smith in his rape trial in Palm Beach. 
The release by the Palm Beach authorities of the depositions by the 18 girls describing the incremental details of the sex acts, the timing of the charges coming just after Rush Limbaugh’s high profile Palm Beach drug bust, the Clinton connection and then with the sudden interest of the Bush FBI in the case, moved the case from solicitation to scandal, and a plea deal with a sentence of 18 months.
He got out of jail in 2010, serving 13 months, of incarceration and then 12 months of house arrest  and moved mostly seamlessly back into his life, to the shock-shock of tabloids whenever they are reminded of his existence (notably, when Epstein’s payment of Fergie’s debts slipped out, likely leaked by Fergie herself).
Some things changed. While surprisingly few others dropped him, the Clinton’s did, an irony of the present tabloid interest in Epstein’s old address book with its many Clinton contacts. And his sex offender status has transformed him from libertine playboy to sex offender in tabloid parlance.
While he has regularly entertained PR proposals aimed at his public rehabilitation, until Friends  prodded him, and until this recent renewed tabloid fever, Epstein had concluded that he was perfectly satisfied living behind high walls and in his own exclusive club. Even the recent Dershowitz-Prince Andrew chapter seems like a parallel disturbance rather than something that is actually affecting him.  His friends are as loyal as one could only hope for .  In speaking to quite a few, without exception they stand behind their trust and like a christain chorus, all say , if you only knew the real story.  but Jeffrey has not made any public statements But true or not, the story has taken on a life of its own, with the US and British tabloid press continuing, so far unsuccessfully, to search for a smoking gun connecting Clinton to underage girls, which could have—many obviously hope—the effect of derailing the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. 
 
It is a curious attribute of his character that, other than perhaps being more circumspect about what legal advice to follow, Epstein would have done little differently. (When I suggested recently to Epstein that one obvious way to blunt the animus bearing down on him would be to get married, he said he’d rather go back to jail.) His life, living it as he wants, seems to him to be an extraordinary accomplishment. Being on the wrong side of a groups morality, custom, politics,  the media, that’s just a bit of bad luck.
And it is perhaps this attitude of his that irks his critics the most. Although he has spent more than a year in jail and paid out what may be as much as $20 million, he yet seems somehow to have not been damaged as they would prefer. -thats worst sin of all. He is the unrepentant catchall of up-to-the-minute badness: the financier whose wealth is a product of Wall Street math rather than work; a rich  good looking ,white man who not only parades his wealth and entitlement, but has a Peter Pan complex to boot; an insistent playboy (excuse me, sex offender ) in a correct and prudish world—someone who somehow didn’t get the memo about vast changes in mores and culture.  
But Epstein’s friends—and I think that is, in the end, the best word for the powerful people who orbit him—are willing to  support him and are willing to expound on his virtues.   Generous philantroppy, science funding at he highest levels and a freedom of discourse that borders on dissent but often is the inspiration for great ideas.  . Epstein is their sole confidant in many instances,  Not the only nexus of them, but one of them. Dr. Epstein. may i Lay on your  couch.  This is the back and forth, the power loop. His expertise is knowing what other people want to know, combined with a lightning fast mind . Which surely offers those who are a part of the conversations a unique sense of confidence that they too now can  understand how the world  of money works. And in a time of such radical flux and existential instability, everybody wants to seek out someone who might have some answers or at least make you feel like he does—even, and maybe especially, the rich.
In the last days of my interviews with Epstein, he was called by a particular world-stage individual, among the richest and most powerful—proudly louche himself—who, feeling out of his depth in a world of crashing oil prices and wild currency fluctuation, had come to believe he might benefit from some private tutoring. Epstein welcomed him to the club.

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022721.txt,"Epstein’s wealth, but gets no closer to an answer, beyond confirming her
own sense of dubiousness.

Epstein, sensing that he might be exposing himself, tried to stop the
process (Ward, well known for offering an operatic view about her reporting
exploits, says he threatened her), called Carter and said he was having
second thoughts about being a public figure.

“Then you should live in a two bedroom apartment in Queens,”
responded Carter.

And then the troubles began.

Epstein, in man-who-can-have-everything fashion, has, for many
years, ordered up a daily massage following his workout sessions.

“Often these were massage massages,” says Epstein matter of factly,
“but sometimes these were happy ending massages, especially in Palm
Beach, where there are many massage parlors—‘Jack Shacks,’ they’re
called—that do outcalls. There was no sex. An often there was no happy
ending. Often I would be on the phone for the entire massage. There were
however a lot of massages and a lot of girls, with one girl recommending
others.”

It is after Epstein’s round of publicity and widely touted association
with Clinton, that the mother of one of the massage parlor girls who went to
Epstein’s house (most of the girls return to Epstein’s house many times) calls
the police. The police interview the girl, Saige Gonzales, who then supplies
names of other girls. Some of whom are found to be younger than 18.

In the end, the police track down 18 girls—nine who are under 18; the
others in their 20s and 30s; one woman is in her 60s—a number of whom
give statements describing scenarios not terribly different from Epstein’s
description above, except each is laid out in clinical, lurid, and near-identical
detail. A cold and forceful Epstein demands that unwitting juveniles (though
they have come here for this very purpose) perform repulsive (or at least
repulsively described) acts on him. (Although the nature of the allegations
will dramatically grow, nobody at this point alleges that he did anything to
them.)

Epstein, tipped to the investigation, vastly raises the stakes, calling
Dershowitz, who flies into Palm Beach to put the local authorities in their
place—alienating Palm Beach officialdom—and, doubling down on the
profile of the case. Dershowitz brings in Roy Black the famous criminal
attorney who defended William Kennedy Smith in his rape trial in Palm
Beach.

geopolitical, and economic consequences, but for investors I think he will
start a period of ‘Economic Olympics’, whereby the federal governments
around the world will take more responsibility and be more proactive to help
their ‘national teams’ to become more competitive in this globalised

world. (1) Free trade is in theory good for economic growth. But there are
other policies (such as well-directed R&D, efficient investment, an effective
educational system) that are also extremely important for long-term growth,
but have been ignored in the past 15 years because of the globalisation

fad. A slowdown in trade globalisation might not be bad for the global
economy, if policy makers replace this engine of growth with other
structural improvements. But while globalisation is more about ‘growth
beta’, other types of structural reforms are about ‘growth alpha’ and
federal/central governments around the world will need to make a greater
effort at leading the economies to prevent them from falling behind. This is
like a government-led program to win Olympic medals, without doping by
central banks. (2) A client kindly brought to my attention an interesting
report done by the Harvard Business School that touches on the idea
mentioned above (‘Problems Unsolved and a Nation Divided: the State of
US Competitiveness 2016’). In it, several sensible and consequential points
were made: ‘The pressing need for a national economic strategy... Given
the significant challenges facing the American economy, the U.S. needs a
national economic strategy more than at any other time in recent history. A
strategy is an integrated set of priorities that builds on strengths while
acknowledging and tackling weaknesses... The U.S. lacks an economic
strategy, especially at the federal level. The implicit strategy has been to
trust the Federal Reserve to solve our problems through monetary

policy... A national economic strategy for the U.S. will require action by
business, state and local governments, and the federal government. All
three levels have a crucial role to play in restoring competitiveness... Taking
leadership in improving U.S. competitiveness is a pressing imperative for
business leaders. Many companies have failed to invest enough in
improving the business environments in the regions in which they
operate...’ This report from the HBS also reiterates some recommendations
they made in 2012: ‘/Our/] Eight-Point Plan consists of the following policy
recommendations: simplify the corporate tax code with lower statutory rates
and no loopholes; move to a territorial tax system like all other leading
nations’; ease the immigration of highly-skilled individuals; aggressively
address distortions and abuses in the international trading system; improve
logistics, communications, and energy infrastructure, simplify and
streamline regulation, create a sustainable federal budget, including reform
of entitlements; and responsibly develop America’s unconventional energy
advantage.’ Interestingly, Mr Trump has discussed many of the same
points. I personally think that, so far, identity politics has distracted from his

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025779.txt,"Economic Research: How Increasing Income Inequality Is Dampening U.S. Economic Growth, And Possible Ways
To Change The Tide

Secular Stagnation

The Fed's expectation for long-run U.S. economic growth has drifted down even more than our forecasts. Five years
ago, the Fed expected to see the economy ambling along at a respectable 2.65% annual pace over the long run. By

June, the Fed's expectation for long-run growth in the U.S. had dropped to 2.2% (central tendency was 2.1% to 2.3%).

The IMF and CBO have also lowered their long-term growth projections. Last month, the IMF lowered its long-run
growth forecast for the US. to about 2% (47). The CBO now projects that real (inflation-adjusted) GDP will increase at

an average annual rate of 2.3% over the next 25 years, compared with 3.1% during 1970-2007.

Aside from the fact that there are different Federal Open Market Committee participants now than before, the Fed's
reasons for lowering its expectations for long-term growth are likely similar to concerns that the IMF and CBO raised,
including the effects of an aging population on the economy and more modest prospects for productivity growth. The
CBO also noted that in addition to the retirement of the baby-boom generation, the declining birth rates and leveling

off of increases in women's participation in the work force also helped slow the growth of the labor force.

In this light, former Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers has said that the U.S. may be mired in a period of
slow growth, marked by only marginal increases in the size of the workforce and small gains in productivity--what he
called secular stagnation (48). This refers to an economic era of persistently insufficient economic demand relative to
the aggregate saving of households and corporations. Here, the U.S. may be stuck in a long-run equilibrium where real
interest rates need to be negative to generate adequate demand. Without that, the US. slides into economic
stagnation. While specific causes of secular stagnation are still uncertain, possible reasons include slower population
growth, an aging population, globalization, and technological changes. An increasingly unequal distribution of income
and wealth is also cited as a contributing factor. Disparate income growth is important because those at the top of the
distribution have a higher savings rate. Since income that is put into savings is not spent, it undercuts the overall level
of economic activity that takes place. Mian and Sufi emphasize the role of income inequality and how recent years
seem to suggest the only way the economy is capable of generating faster economic growth is by being juiced with

more aggressive credit expansion, which does not last (49).

Unfortunately, the move toward low-paying jobs has continued unabated. In the past four years since the outset of the
US. economic recovery, job gains have come mainly in low-paying positions, according to the National Employment
Law Project, an advocacy group for low-income workers. While 22% of job losses during the recession were in
lower-wage industries, 44% of employment growth in the past four years has come in this group--meaning that, today,
lower-wage industries employ 1.85 million more Americans than before the downturn. And often these low-wage jobs
have less access to benefits, such as private health insurance, pensions, and paid leave, compared with their
higher-paying brethren (50). Considering the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ forecasts that low-paying jobs will dominate

employment gains for the next decade, it seems clear that labor-income disparity will continue to widen.

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031827.txt,"He is hardly alone in making it. Numerous journalists have published books and articles retracing the
paths that led the world economy to the precipice two years ago. The deregulation of the financial
services industry in the 1980s and ’90s; the growing popularity of complex and risky derivatives; the real
estate bubble and the explosion of subprime lending — none of these developments were exactly secret.
On the contrary, they were celebrated as vindications of the power and wisdom of markets. Accordingly,

Mr. Ferguson recycles choice moments of triumphalism, courtesy of Lawrence H. Summers, George W.

Bush, Alan Greenspan and various cable television ranters and squawkers.

Even as stock indexes soared and profits swelled, there were always at least a few investors, economists
and government officials who warned that the frenzied speculation was leading to the abyss. Some of
these prophets without honor show up in front of Mr. Ferguson’s camera, less to gloat than to present,

once again, the analyses that were dismissed and ignored by their peers for so long.

Dozens of interviews — along with news clips and arresting aerial shots of New York, Iceland and other
disaster areas — are folded into a clear and absorbing history, narrated by Matt Damon. The music (an
opening song, “Big Time,” by Peter Gabriel, and a score by Alex Heffes) and the clean wide-screen
cinematography provide an aesthetic polish that is welcome for its own sake and also important to the
movie's themes. The handsomely lighted and appointed interiors convey a sense of the rarefied,
privileged worlds in which the Wall Street operators and their political enablers flourished, and the
elegance of the presentation also subliminally bolsters the film’s authority. This is not a piece of ragged

muckraking or breathless advocacy. It rests its outrage on reason, research and careful argument.

The same was true of Mr. Ferguson’s previous documentary, “No End in Sight,” which focused on

catastrophic policies carried out in Iraq by President George W. Bush’s administration just after the

overthrow of Saddam Hussein. But whereas that film concentrated on a narrow view of a complex subject
— the conduct of the war rather than the at least equally controversial rationale for fighting it — “Inside
Job” offers a sweeping synthesis, going as far back as the Reagan administration and as far afield as

Iceland in its anatomy of the financial crisis.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, many of the highest-profile players declined to be interviewed. Mr. Summers
appears only in news footage, and none of his predecessors or successors as Treasury secretary — not
Robert E. Rubin or Henry M. Paulson Jr. or Timothy F. Geithner — submit to Mr. Ferguson’s questions.
Nor do any of the top executives at Goldman Sachs or the other big banks. Most of the interviewees are,
at least from the perspective of the filmmaker, friendly witnesses, adding fuel to the director’s
comprehensive critique of the way business has been done in the United States and the other advanced

capitalist countries for the past two decades.

Both American political parties are indicted; “Inside Job” is not simply another belated settling of
accounts with Mr. Bush and his advisers, though they are hardly ignored. The scaling back of government
oversight and the weakening of checks on speculative activity by banks began under Reagan and
continued during the Clinton administration. And with each administration the market in derivatives

expanded, and alarms about the dangers of this type of investment were ignored. Raghuram Rajan, chief

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017536.txt,"ANTONIO DAMASIO

Antonio Damasio (born February 25, 1944 in Lisbon, Portugal)
is a University Professor (an award based on multi-disciplinary
interests and significant accomplishments in several
disciplines) and David Dornsife Professor of Neuroscience at
the University of Southern California, where he heads USC’s
Brain and Creativity Institute. Prior to taking up his posts at
USC, in 2005, Damasio was M.W. Van Allen Professor and
Head of Neurology at the University of Iowa Hospitals and
Clinics from 1976 to 2005. He is also Adjunct Professor

at the Salk Institute.

Damasio is the author of several best-selling
books which describe his scientific thinking. “As a leading
neuroscientist, Damasio has dared to speculate on
neurobiological data, and has offered a theory about the
relationship between human emotions, human rationality,
and the underlying biology.”

Damasio was born in Lisbon and studied medicine
at the University of Lisbon Medical School in Portugal, where
he also did his neurological residency and completed his
doctorate. He worked as a research fellow at the Aphasia
Research Center in Boston in 1967, prior to receiving his
MD in Lisbon. His work there on behavioural neurology
was done under the supervision of the late Norman
Geschwind, the Harvard neurologist who created the field.

As aresearcher, Damasio’s main field is the
neurobiology of the mind, especially neural systems which
subserve emotion, decision-making, memory, language and
consciousness. Damasio’s seeks to demonstrate that emotions
play a critical role in high level cognition, an idea that ran
counter to dominant 2oth century views in psychology,
neuroscience and philosophy. He showed that emotions and
their biological underpinnings are involved in decision-making
(both positively and negatively, and often non-consciously);
provide the scaffolding for the construction of social cognition;
and are required for the self processes which undergird
consciousness. “Damasio provides a contemporary scientific
validation of the linkage between feelings and the body by
highlighting the connection between mind and nerve cells...
this personalized embodiment of mind.”

He formulated the somatic markers hypothesis,
which captures the essence of these ideas. This idea has
inspired many systems-neuroscience experiments carried out
in laboratories in the U.S. and Europe, and has had a major
impact in contemporary science and philosophy. His articles
on this topic include: Bechara A, Damasio AR, Damasio H,
Anderson S. Insensitivity to future consequences following
damage to human prefrontal cortex. Cognition. 50:7-15. 19943
Bechara A, Damasio H, Tranel D, Damasio AR. Deciding
advantageously before knowing the advantageous strategy.
Science. 275:1293-1294. 1997; Anderson SW, Bechara A,
Damasio H, Tranel D, Damasio AR. Impairment of social
and moral behaviour related to early damage in human
prefrontal cortex. Nature Neuroscience. 2:1032-1037. Damasio

has been named by the Institute of Scientific Information as
one of the most highly cited researchers in the past decade).
Current work on the biology of moral decisions, neuro-
economics, social communication, and drug-addiction,

has been strongly influenced by Damasio’s hypothesis.

Damasio also proposed that emotions are part of
homeostatic regulation and are rooted in reward/punishment
mechanisms. He recovered James’ perspective on feelings as
aread-out of body states, but expanded it with an “as-if-body-
loop” device which allows for the substrate of feelings to be
simulated rather than actual (foreshadowing the simulation
process later uncovered by mirror neurons). He demonstrated
experimentally that the insular cortex is a critical platform
for feelings, a finding that has been widely replicated, and
he uncovered cortical and subcortical induction sites for
human emotions, e.g. in ventromedial prefrontal cortex
and amygdala. He also demonstrated that while the
insular cortex plays a major role in feelings, it is not
necessary for feelings to occur, suggesting that brain
stem structures play a basic role in the feeling process.

He has continued to investigate the neural basis of
feelings and demonstrated that although the insular cortex is
a major substrate for this process it is not exclusive, suggesting
that brain stem nuclei are critical platforms as well. He
regards feelings as the necessary foundation of sentience.

In another development, Damasio proposed that
the cortical architecture on which learning and recall depend
involves multiple, hierarchically organized loops of axonal
projections that converge on certain nodes out of which
projections diverge to the points of origin of convergence
(the convergence-divergence framework). This architecture
is applicable to the understanding of memory processes
and of aspects of consciousness related to the access
of mental contents.

In “The Feeling of What Happens”, Damasio lays
the foundations of the “enchainment of precedences”: “the
nonconscious neural signaling of an individual organism
begets the protoself which permits core self and core
consciousness, which allow for an autobiographical self,
which permits extended consciousness. At the end of the
chain, extended consciousness permits conscience.

Damasio’s research depended significantly on
establishing the modern human lesion method, an enterprise
made possible by Hanna Damasio’s structural neuroimaging/
neuroanatomy work complemented by experimental
neuroanatomy (with Gary Van Hoesen and Josef Parvizi),
experimental neuropsychology (with Antoine Bechara, Ralph
Adolphs, and Dan Tranel) and functional neuroimaging (with
Kaspar Meyer, Jonas Kaplan, and Mary Helen Immordino-
Yang). The experimental neuroanatomy work with Van Hoesen
and Bradley Hyman led to the discovery of the disconnection
of the hippocampus caused by neurofibrillary tangles in the
entophinal cortex of patients with Alzheimer’s disease.

As a clinician, he and his collaborators

have studied and treated disorders of behaviour
and cognition, and movement disorders.

Damasio’s books deal with the relationship between
emotions and feelings, and what their brain substrates. His
1994 book, Descartes’ Error: Emotion, Reason and the Human
Brain, won the Science et Vie prize, was a finalist for the
Los Angeles Times Book Award, and is translated in over 30
languages. It is regarded as one of the most influential books
of the past two decades. His second book, The Feeling of What
Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness,
was named as one of the ten best books of 2001 by the New
York Times Book Review, a Publishers Weekly Best Book of
the Year, a Library Journal Best Book of the Year, and has
over 30 foreign editions. Damasio’s Looking for Spinoza: Joy,
Sorrow, and the Feeling Brain, was published in 2003. In it,
Damasio suggested that Spinoza’s thinking foreshadowed
discoveries in biology and neuroscience views on the mind-
body problem. Spinoza was a protobiologist. His latest book
is Self Comes to Mind: Constructing the Conscious Brain. In
it Damasio suggests that the self is the key to conscious
minds and that feelings, from the kind he designates as
primordial to the well-known feelings of emotion, are the
basic elements in the construction of the protoself and core
self. The book received the Corinne International Book Prize.

Damasio is a member of the American Academy of
Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences’ Institute
of Medicine, and the European Academy of Sciences and Arts.
Damasio has received many awards including the Prince of
Asturias Award in Science and Technology, the Honda Prize,
the Kappers Neuroscience Medal, the Beaumont Medal from
the American Medical Association, the Nonino Prize and the
Reenpaa Prize in Neuroscience. He has received honorary
doctoral degrees (Doctor honoris causa) from the University
of Aachen (2002), University of Aveiro (2003), University
of Copenhagen (Copenhagen Business School; 2009),
University of Leiden (2010), University Ramon Llull,
Barcelona (2010), University of Coimbra (2011) and
from the EPFL, Lausanne (2011).

His current work involves the social emotions,
consciousness and the creative interface between
neuroscience and the arts, especially music and
film. The role of feelings states on sentience.

Damasio is married to Dr. Hanna Damasio,
his colleague and frequent co-author.

Damasio himself notes, in fallibilist fashion,

“Thave a difficult time seeing scientific results, especially in
neurobiology, as anything but provisional approximations”’.
Whether despite or because of that fallibilism, Damasio
writes in the belief that ‘scientific knowledge can

be a pillar to help humans endure and prevail’.

Q&A on the USA, with a watchful eye on the risk of giant man-eating plants; Spain
Our view for 2012 was that economic and equity market conditions in the US and Asia ex-Japan would be better than in
Europe. So far, that view is on track. Spain in particular is in difficult shape (see page 5); its banks and government
may have to borrow 1.5 trillion Euros over the next 12 months while in recession. Both the ECB and EU will need to
keep the spigot open to prevent Spain from becoming a bigger problem. This week, some Q&A on the US recovery,
flows into bonds and stocks, profits and P/E multiples, municipal bonds, and the long-term US fiscal situation.
The Fed appears to be saying that no additional monetary easing is needed unless the economy worsens further. Are there any
signs that the US recovery is becoming self-reinforcing?
Durable goods consumption, equipment & software spending, vehicle sales, bank loans to companies, manufacturing payrolls
(even after Friday’s disappointing report) and housing stats (building permits, multifamily housing starts) have improved over
the last few months. While delinquency rates are in better shape (credit card delinquencies are back to 2007 levels), household
credit growth is still weak. However, homebuilders are seeing stronger demand, and nationwide remodeling continues to rise.
We see opportunities in retailing and building products companies that may benefit from a continuation in these trends.

Has the data really been that good? I heard better US economic data has a lot to do with the weather.
Parts of the US experienced the warmest March in recorded history. Measured from December to February, the winter was the
4 th warmest on record. I don’t think there are reliable models to estimate the impact of demand being pulled forward, so we will
have to see how consumer spending, housing and payrolls behave in the months ahead. As our Chief Economist Michael
Vaknin reminds me, other distortions come from the “catch-up” effect from Japan’s tsunami. As shown below, some
strength in auto sales came from pent-up demand for Japanese cars, a process which now seems complete.

So where does that leave the US payroll and growth picture?
The weakness in the payroll report was almost entirely concentrated in retailing. Net of distortions and seasonal adjustments, it
looks like payroll growth is running at 150-175k per month, and GDP growth is running at a 2.25% trend pace, both below prior
recoveries. While 2.25% is a barn-burner compared to Europe, it only corresponds to a modest improvement in employment.
That’s why 2013 US fiscal policy is so important: this is not a recovery that can withstand much tighter fiscal conditions.

Q&A on the USA, with a watchful eye on the risk of giant man-eating plants; Spain
So, how tight is US fiscal policy supposed to get next year?
Very, if you look at what is supposed to happen according to current law. In the chart, we show the annual change in the budget
deficit over the last 25 years. The impact of all provisions scheduled to expire and kick in during 2013 would be very large. But
if Congress and the President elect to extend current tax rates, retain lower payroll tax rates and extended jobless benefits, etc,
the adjustment would not be as big, and only reflect expiration of Recovery Act provisions, the recently passed Budget Control
Act, and some other smaller provisions. There are of course plenty of permutations in between.

What direction is the Congress heading, and what did Larry Summers and Brad DeLong have to say about this recently?
Political outcomes this fall will affect what Congress does, but I get the sense that they will punt fiscal adjustments into the
future if they can, and impose austerity of no more than 1% of GDP in 2013. If so, Congress can point to a March 2012 paper
by Summers and DeLong as justification. The bottom line from the paper: don’t tighten fiscal policy when interest rates are
near zero. The authors assert that (a) additional government spending can ease the long-term budget constraint in conditions
similar to today’s, and (b) tightening policy now would risk permanent loss of human capital, lower labor productivity growth
and lower trend growth. They have held these views for a while; the paper appears designed to convince others.
Advocates for more fiscal and monetary stimulus often point to the charts below. Rising Federal debt has not resulted in higher
interest rates, so why not keep borrowing more? As for the Fed, balance sheet expansion prevented deflation and hasn’t resulted
in an inflationary surge (core inflation measured over 3 months just came in below 2%), so why not keep doing it? Aren’t
these charts amazing?

They are amazing, but no one knows how long they can be sustained. Even Summers and DeLong concede that “even if it is
granted that the stimulus can be both timely and temporary, the question of how large it can be while preserving these attributes
remains for future research”. If one of these trends could not be sustained, my guess is that it would be fiscal constraints rather
than monetary ones. While it’s great to see rising Federal debt not adversely affecting Treasury markets, the chart on the left

Q&A on the USA, with a watchful eye on the risk of giant man-eating plants; Spain
What is The Day of the Triffids?
It’s a 1951 science fiction novel. There’s a meteor shower, and most people go outside to look at it. The next morning,
everyone who looked at the meteor shower ends up blind, and Earth is taken over by giant man-eating venomous plants. The
point: some amazing events which look benign have unforeseen consequences. Will a pact of going for growth pay the
freight of higher Federal debt in the long run? Hard to say; there are not a lot of examples to draw from. Economic theories and
their associated debt bubbles don’t always work out as planned 1 . After WWII, the US also faced a debt ratio of 80% of GDP.
Austerity was not the answer back then; government receipts and outlays as a % of GDP did not change much during the 1950’s,
and net debt was flat. So how did US debt/GDP fall from 80% to 46% in just ten years? Robust annualized real growth of
more than 4.0%, and 2.0% inflation. However, unique economic conditions and productivity gains of the 1950’s (e.g., interstate
highway, rebuilding of Europe and Japan) may not be repeated, and the country was not headed into an entitlement time bomb.
If the US does not experience a growth/productivity boom, the burden of higher debt could last for a generation or more. A progrowth
Administration would probably help, but the difficulty lay in defining exactly what that means.
Isn’t it amazing?

Are there debt vs austerity parallels at the state and local level?
Yes and no. At the state and local level, over last decade, more than 1 trillion in unfunded pension and healthcare (OPEB)
related liabilities were recognized (they were accrued over a longer period). Even these “as-reported” estimates, which come
from the states, may be underestimated. A 2011 analysis by the Joint Economic Committee shows that lower portfolio return
assumptions on pension assets sharply increase the magnitude of underfunded pensions (see chart, right) 2 .

Obama Cabinet. Goolsbee praises the benefits of subprime lending and related affordable housing policies, mocks Congress for holding
hearings on the subject and cites Federal Reserve papers in saying that the “mortgage market has become more perfect, not more
irresponsible”. Some things are only clear in hindsight. http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/29/business/29scene.html?_r=2

Q&A on the USA, with a watchful eye on the risk of giant man-eating plants; Spain
However, there’s more of an effort at the state/local level to address this issue than at the Federal level. More than 40
states lowered pension benefit liabilities over the last 3 years according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Measures taken include raising employee contributions (while lowering employer payments), raising minimum retirement ages,
cutting post-employment healthcare benefits and in some cases, switching to defined contribution from defined benefit plans.
The good news, to paraphrase Mark Twain, is that reports of municipal bonds’ demise have been greatly exaggerated. From
1970 through to the end of 2011, municipal bonds rated by Moody’s experienced a grand total of 71 defaults among 17,700
issuers (11 of which occurred during 2010 and 2011). General obligation bonds accounted for 5 defaults; 29 were related to
housing; 22 for hospitals and healthcare; 3-4 each for education and infrastructure. Utilities and cities registered 2 each, while
counties, special districts, and water & sewer and experienced 1 each. The average recovery for defaulted munis was 65%,
compared to 49% on corporate senior unsecured bonds. Last comment on municipals: while local tax collections are weak due
to the collapse in home prices, state tax collections have been increasing for 7 quarters in a row.

OK, so the US economy is improving, but is still heavily dependent on monetary and fiscal stimulus to grow; and the only belttightening
one can find is at the state and local level. Since 2009, after equities collapsed and bond prices rose, how have many
investors reacted?
By selling more equities and buying a lot more bonds. See chart above (a global version of this chart looks roughly the same).
Have investors been positioning this way since stocks are expensive?
Not really. Insert a giant martini glass on the chart below from 1998 to 2001 (I hate using simple averages which include
periods when the market had lost its collective mind). The current P/E multiple is in the middle of the ex-bubble range of the
last 25 years. Some bank stocks look interesting, even after accounting for reliance on shrinking loan loss reserves to drive
income, and ongoing regulatory uncertainty. Most US banks are at or close to Basel 3 funding needs, have considerably fewer
capital adequacy questions than their European counterparts, and do not rely on wholesale funding to finance loan portfolios.

Now that P/E multiples have risen off the bottom, what’s the outlook for P/E multiples and earnings from here?

Apple (3% of the S&P index, 15% of S&P’s YTD returns). As shown below, earnings revisions have been negative for 2012,
but analysts are still optimistic about 2013. According to Morgan Stanley, analysts are forecasting the highest percentage of
companies posting 2013 margin expansion since 1970, and by a very wide margin. In our view, it will be difficult for multiples
to rise further unless earnings outperform expectations, particularly if Europe’s structural problems take center stage again.

The place that worries me the most: Spain. It ranks at or
close to the bottom in a lot of categories (see table), and
its growth outlook is poor. Historically, this kind of
thing has not ended well. Spain has defaulted 13 times
since 1500 AD; it’s probably going to take a lot of
bilateral aid and ECB financing to prevent another one.

me in some sense one of the few independent sources of information and
actual honest brokers. That’s the usefulness of disgrace.”

And then there is too, that he is right. Since I began working on this
piece in September, Epstein predictions about the price of oil, yen, ruble,
and euro have all born out. (If I had invested $100,000 the way Epstein said
I should in early September, by the end of January I would have made $2.3
million. Alas, I did not.)

And something else, which perhaps also surely accounts for Epstein’s
continuing relationships with the rich and powerful:

Most everyone who is now of a certain age and certain ambition and
certain status grew up in, and found they were temperamentally suited to, the
new age of wealth that started in the late 1970s. A meritocracy on steroids,
or, as Vanity Fair would baldly and ingratiatingly dub it, the new
establishment, an increasingly parallel world, a self-invented one, at further
and further remove from the ordinary one. In some sense, Epstein is just one
version, picaresque, as well as louche, of this shared story.

He often tells, with some obvious marvel, his middle class to riches
tale. He was born in 1953 in Coney Island. His father worked for the city’s
Parks Department. His mother was a housewife. He has a younger brother,
Mark.

Epstein was distinguished by little other than his math talents. The
captain of the math team at Lafayette High school in Bensonhurst, he goes
on to Cooper Union where the tuition is free. He drops out after two years
and begins taking classes at the NYU’s Courant Institute of Mathematics.
Then, without a college degree, hence by a slight of hand, gets a job teaching
math and physics at Dalton in 1974. (A few years ago, during a chance
encounter with a former Dalton math department chairman, Margo Gumport,
I asked her about Epstein. She said he was the most brilliant math teacher at
Dalton in her 50-year career and that she had often wondered what had
become of him.)

It’s his first exposure to the wealthy. They have, he concludes, just as
many problems as the people in Coney Island, just different ones, almost
invariably involving divorce and money. “I found it interesting as a science
experiment,” he recalled not long ago as we chatted about his life. “It did not
really involve me. I could just stand back and watch.”

Dalton fathers were attracted to him. Punch Sulzberger, the publisher
of the New York Times, and a Dalton father at the time, tried to recruit
Epstein to come to the Times. (Epstein recounts a story of riding with

A. Case # 08-2432, Beachfront Vista Property, Nightingale Beach Club Association
Violation of Chapter 134, Section 134-1472 (3) of the Town of Palm Beach Code
of Ordinances, no additional walls, fences, hedges or other structures or growth
shall be erected or be grown eastwardly of Ocean Boulevard to a height greater
than four (4) feet above the surface of the Ocean Boulevard.

(Ms. Duemler recused herself as part of a previously declared conflict and Mr.
Hoffman advised Mr. Vanneck would be a voting member in this case)

Lead Code Enforcement Officer Walton said Nightingale Beach Club had
previously been found in violation and was given time to obtain a permit. A permit
was obtained but there were some conditions attached to it. There have been two
inspections with the Florida Wildlife Commission and an agreement was reached to
not require the vegetation to be trimmed until after turtle season. Since they have
already been found in non-compliance, the Town recommends the time for
compliance be extended to November 7, 2008 and if compliance is not achieved by
that date, a fine of $250.00 a day be imposed.

Jack Maxey, 244 Nightingale Trail, presented some documents to the Board and
advised he was president of the Nightingale Trail Beach Club Association. He said
one of the documents was his application under duress for the permit. Mr. Maxey
advised he had not been sworn in and was administered the oath of office by
Recording Secretary Houston.

Mr. Maxey said he has had a long correspondence with the legal department of the
Department of Environmental Protection and he believes on an emotional level,
they do not believe the trees should come down but they told him they could not
find any statutory way to force the Town not to enforce the permit. They told him
it should be the jurisdiction of a court, not the DEP. Mr. Maxey said the Town
was cutting down its own sea grapes in violation of the permitting process. Mr.
Maxey said there were all kinds of burdens in this permit he needed to comply
with, one of which was replacement of the whole plant if anything over 6 feet tall
which was larger than 3 inches in diameter was cut down. He said he was
supposed to provide a signature on the document putting himself at risk of a
$10,000 a day fine if he did not comply with the requirements of the permit. Mr.
Maxey said Jean Higgins, a biologist for the State Fish & Wildlife, recommended
sea grapes should not be trimmed because they are the best source of protection
against the lighting. Ms. Higgins made some suggestions such as changing light
fixtures and extinguishing lights during turtle season and maintaining a substantial
healthy vegetation light blocking buffer.

Mr. Maxey said an approximate 24 inch piece of aluminum is hanging from the
light on Nightingale Trail and it seemed highly unusual that a shield of that nature
would only be necessary on that light when the recommendations given by Fish &
Wildlife are recommendations with broad reaching impact for the entire island. He

Q. Okay. You felt that it furthered her legal
interests to specify American politicians, powerful
business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known
prime minister and other world leaders; that was your --
you -- you believe that furthered her legal interest?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you also anticipate that that would
titilate the Press, so to speak, that there would be a
lot of speculation on who these people are?

A. That wasn't the -- that wasn't the focus
of the -~ those comments, no.

Q. You said it wasn't the focus. Did you
realize it would happen?

A. Sure. I mean, this was a case that had
been already ~~ this litigation had been going on at
that point for seven years and lots of people were
following it. This is -~ this case is one of the most
egregious examples of a violation of Crime Victims'
Rights in the history of this country.

And so against that context, yes, there were
going to be people interested in every word that was
going into this pleading. Whether we had gone more
broadly or more narrowly than what we did, people were
going to be interested in this.

Q. And as of December 30th of 2014, Miss Roberts
ESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS
(954) 331-4400
293
had the same ability to disclose who these individuals
were publicly, as did Jeffrey Epstein, correct, because
she had personal knowledge of who they were?

A. She had the ability to speak the words, but,
again, I think it's preposterous to say that a victim of
sex trafficking has the same power as the sex trafficker
to disclose information.

For example, Virginia Roberts could be
attacked, and I think as we were talking about
yesterday, we have seen evidence of the kind of attack
that powerful people can mount against the victims of
sex trafficking. So to say that the young women in sex
trafficking schemes have the same power as their
traffickers to do this ~~ I'm sorry. I'm going to have
to take a break.

Q. Okay.
MR. SCAROLA: Could you just read back the
last question for me? I just want to orient
myself as to where we are. Thank you.
(Thereupon, a portion of the record was read
by the reporter.)
MR. SCAROLA: Yeah, I didn't I think the
answer was -~
THE WITNESS: I guess | was mid-sentence, so
think I will just stick with the same word,
preposterous. And one -- one thing that occurred
to me during the break, in the context of this
case, is that there had been allegations that
Epstein was part of the -- the sex trafficking
organization, had video cameras mounted
throughout many of his -- his mansions. And so,
whereas a young woman could say, or a young girl
could say, look, I was a victim of sex abuse,
people would attack her; people wouldn't believe
her, that unless she had, you know, corroborating
evidence, people would say, well, look, it didn't
happen.
And so Epstein had managed to collect
apparently a lot of videotapes and other kinds of
ESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS

information that would have been -- given him the
ability to make the blackmail kinds of charges
that the girls that he was trafficking would --
would not have had the ability to do.

BY MR. SIMPSON:

Q. Mr. Cassell, didn't you testify yesterday
that any videotapes from Mr. Epstein’s house had been
destroyed?

A. I-- when I used the word “destroyed,” I
probably should have been more precise. They had been
concealed from law enforcement, is what I meant. That
when Palm Beach Police Department went up to the Epstein
mansion, they found surveillance cameras and other
cameras. I can't remember exactly where the cameras
were, but they found surveillance cameras, and when they
looked for the tapes associated with those cameras, I
used the word destroyed; and as I say, I probably
should have said they were missing. And so they were
never able to locate those -~- those missing videotapes.

Q. Soas of December 30th of 2014, to your
knowledge, there were no videotapes available?

A. There were no videotapes available to law
enforcement or to Brad and his pro bono crime victim
attorneys to help document our case. We were trying to
get those and we are continuing to try to get those,

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016348.txt,"WILL COMPUTERS BECOME OUR OVERLORDS?
Venki Ramakrishnan

Venki Ramakrishnan is a scientist at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of
Molecular Biology, Cambridge University; recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry
(2009); current president of the Royal Society; and the author of Gene Machine: The
Race to Discover the Secrets of the Ribosome.

A former colleague of mine, Gérard Bricogne, used to joke that carbon-based intelligence
was simply a catalyst for the evolution of silicon-based intelligence. For quite a long
time, both Hollywood movies and scientific Jeremiahs have been predicting our eventual
capitulation to our computer overlords. We all await the singularity, which always seems
to be just over the horizon.

In a sense, computers have already taken over, facilitating virtually every aspect
of our lives—from banking, travel, and utilities to the most intimate personal
communication. I can see and talk to my grandson in New York for free. I remember
when I first saw the 1968 movie 200/: A Space Odyssey, the audience laughed at the
absurdly cheap cost of a picturephone call from space: $1.70, at a time when a long-
distance call within the U.S. was $3 per minute.

However, the convenience and power of computers is also something of a
Faustian bargain, for it comes with a loss of control. Computers prevent us from doing
things we want. Try getting on a flight if you arrive at the airport and the airline
computer systems are down, as happened not so long ago to British Airways at Heathrow.
The planes, pilots, and passengers were all there; even the air-traffic controls were
working. But no flights for that airline were allowed to take off. Computers also make
us do things we don’t want—by generating mailing lists and print labels to send us all
millions of pieces of unwanted mail, which we humans have to sort, deliver, and dispose
of.

But you ain’t seen nothing yet. In the past, we programmed computers using
algorithms we understood at least in principle. So when machines did amazing things
like beating world chess champion Garry Kasparov, we could say that the victorious
programs were designed with algorithms based on our own understanding—using, in this
instance, the experience and advice of top grandmasters. Machines were simply faster at
doing brute-force calculations, had prodigious amounts of memory, and were not prone to
errors. One article described Deep Blue’s victory not as that of a computer, which was
just a dumb machine, but as the victory of hundreds of programmers over Kasparov, a
single individual.

That way of programming is changing dramatically. After a long hiatus, the
power of machine learning has taken off. Much of the change came when programmers,
rather than trying to anticipate and code for every possible contingency, allowed
computers to train themselves on data, using deep neural networks based on models of
how our own brains learn. They use probabilistic methods to “learn” from large
quantities of data; computers can recognize patterns and come up with conclusions on
their own. A particularly powerful method is called reinforcement learning, by which the
computer learns, without prior input, which variables are important and how much to

Re: Edwards and Cassell v. Dershowitz
February 25, 2015

test the accuracy of those statements and to explore the full extent of the personal
relationship he has had with Jeffrey Epstein.

Evasive Answers

The response to Interrogatory #2 is a typical example of an evasive response. Rather
than address the substance of the questions posed, the Defendant engages in a four page
diatribe about the alleged impropriety of naming him in a CVRA filing on behalf of
Jane Doe #3. If that is the only improper conduct in which the Defendant contends
Bradley Edwards has engaged, then the Defendant is obliged to say so.

Interrogatory #3 asks for the specific content of statements and the names of every
witness to the making of the statements. We get a vague reference to “such comments”
and references to the inability to “recall all of the people.” Not a single witness’ name
is disclosed. If the Defendant is unable to identify a single person he is obliged to
unequivocally say so.

Refusing to Provide Substantive Responses Until Jane Doe #3 is Deposed

This objection has absolutely no legal basis and fails to recognize that this is a
defamation action against Dershowitz and not Mr. Dershowitz’s defamation action
against Jane Doe #3. This action is absolutely not dependent on the accuracy of the
statements made by Jane Doe #3, although the Plaintiffs were and are confident of the
accuracy of those statements.

Objecting Because You Think We Already Know the Answers

See for example the Response to Interrogatory #13. There is no legal basis for refusing
to provide information because the Defendant believes the Plaintiff already knows the
answer or has alternative sources to ascertain some or all of the information requested.
An admission from an opposing party carries legal significance that other evidence does
not have. We are entitled to Dershowitz’s sworn responses regardless of what flight
logs purport to show.

Incomplete Answers
See, for example, Interrogatory #15. A question that asks for names, addresses, and

telephone numbers, is not properly responded to if all we get is, “Thomas and Joanne
Ashe, as well as Defendant’s wife and daughter.”

multibillion-dollar enterprise of outsourcing the management of the
NSA’s computer networks and other technical work to outside con-
tractors. It also casts doubts on the post-9/11 decision by the intel-
ligence community to strip away much of the NSA’s “stovepiping”
that previously insulated its most sensitive computers. Without
such stovepiping, any rogue civilian employee could bring down the
entire edifice of shared intelligence.

A finding that Snowden had acted in concert with others in breach-
ing compartments at the NSA would hardly be any more reassuring.
Such collaboration among intelligence workers would reflect gravely
on the mind-set of the NSA. Snowden described an atmosphere in
which intelligence workers exchanged lewd photographs of foreign
suspects. Some NSA employees met to protest the NSA policies. Did
this violation of the NSA‘s rules also involve abetting the theft of
documents? If so, the NSA would have to evaluate further vulner-
abilities that might arise when it entrusts its secrets to technicians
who do not share its values. A collaborative breach would signal an
immense failure of the present concept of the counterintelligence

© regime in the NSA. ©

From what I gathered from government officials who were famil-
iar with the investigation, there was a concern that answering the
“how” question would rouse serious doubts about the very ability
of the NSA to carry out its core mission of protecting the govern-
ment’s intelligence secrets. However it was organized, it was clear
that Snowden had played a major role in what amounted to a bril-
liant intelligence coup.

In the audience of about a hundred professional mathematicians and one amateur, |
was the only one that laughed.

Historians of mathematics point to the successful generalization of Euclidian
geometry via its abstract axioms, postulates and logical operations to a new, not
naturally intuitable, almost nonvisualizable, non-Euclidean geometry (with the new
geometric axiom, parallel lines do meet at infinity), as evidence against the Kantian
idea of the intuitively accessible, a priori status of geometry. This served as an
example of where mathematics naturally resides, and argues in favor of the thought
control imposed by the modern set theoretic and logical rituals of mathematical
theorem and proof. Thom, in a_hereditary-evolutionary biological argument
developed in Semiophysics, said “Objections raised to the Kantian apriority of
Euclidean geometry after the discovery of non-Euclidean geometries, and the
theories of twentieth century physics (restricted and general relativity, quantum
mechanics) appear to me to be irrelevant...they deal with ...the infinitely small and
infinitely large...which lies outside the usual cognitive activity of ancient man.”

In my discussions with him, Thom found equivalence relations between
mental and real world objects and their behaviors. He described what he called an
abstract physicalist truth that describes a psychic universe, which, in turn, simulates

outside things and processes. Much like the transcendent experiential God | have

redeployments — on only the /and part of a land-for-peace deal — meant we risked
ignoring the core issues that would determine whether a full peace agreement was
achievable.

More urgently, I knew from our diplomats in the US that the Americans would
not necessarily be receptive to a further delay in moving ahead with Oslo, even if it
meant focusing on trying to make peace with Syria. That made my first visit to see
President Clinton as Prime Minister especially important.

It was billed as a “working visit” and work we did. After a gala dinner for Nava
and me in the White House, we helicoptered to the presidential retreat at Camp
David. President Clinton and I spent more than 10 hours discussing shared security
challenges in the Middle East, especially terrorist groups and states like Iran that
were backing them, and, of course, how best to move forward our efforts to
negotiate peace. These face-to-face meetings set a pattern that would last
throughout the time he and I were in office. On almost all key issues, my
preference was to deal directly with the President, something I know sometimes
frustrated other senior US negotiators like Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and Mideast envoy Dennis Ross. This was not out of any disrespect for them. It
was because the decisions on which negotiations would succeed or fail would have
to be made at the top, just as President Clinton and I would ultimately carry the
responsibility, or the blame, for errors, missteps or missed opportunities.

Our first meeting ran until three in the morning. When the President asked me
how I saw the peace process going forward, he smiled, in obviously relief, at my
answer: I wanted to move quickly. He had only a limited time left in office, and I
was determined that we not waste it. Much is often made about the personal
“chemistry” in political relationships. Too much, I think, because the core issues,
and the trade-offs of substance, are what truly matter when negotiating matters of
the weight, and long-term implications, of Middle East peace. Still, chemistry does
help when moments of tension or crisis arise, as they inevitably do. My first few
days with President Clinton laid a foundation that allowed us to work together even
when things got tough. I benefited, I’m sure, simply by not being Bibi. The

Bannon; He Is 'As Dangerous 
as Ever' 
by THOMAS D. WILLIAMS, PH.D.11 Mar 2018 
0 
As Steve Bannon continues his tour of Europe, energizing the anti-
establishment populist base, the mainstream media cannot help but 
admit their admiration for his abilities, despite their dislike of his aims. 
In this week's issue, the left-wing German weekly Stern articulates the greatest fear of the European 
establishment: that Bannon could give the fragmented right in Europe a common ideology and rhetoric. 
Many thought that the reign of the Dark Lord had ended, writes Gernot Kramper, when Steve Bannon left 
first the White House and then his role as executive chairman of Breitbart News. It turns out, however, that 
Bannon's adversaries had underestimated him, because he is as dangerous as ever, he confesses. 
Kramper cannot conceal his respect for Bannon's ability to move a crowd. He was greeted by frenetic 
applause in his recent address before France's National Front party, Kramper writes, demonstrating his 
impressive potential, which the writer describes as dangerous. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025525 
In the mind of his audience, Bannon is something of a miracle-worker, Stamper notes, having done the 
impossible by bringing Donald Trump into the White House. 
The reason Bannon is dangerous, Kramper continues, is because he lays out the political program of a 
worldwide right: He has already conquered the USA; now Europe and then the whole world will follow. 
You are part of a worldwide movement that is bigger than France, bigger than Italy, bigger than Hungary, 
bigger than all that, Bannon told French populists. 
Bannon showed that he dominates the mood against the 'elites,' the 'establishment' and the 'perverse 
system' of greedy corporations and banks, and of course also against the press, which is led around 'like a dog 
on the Leash, Stamper writes. 
And now he Mr. Bannon setting himself up as an instigator, if not an outright shepherd, of a movement that 
crosses borders, languages and parties. 
Bannon is a master of apocalyptic rhetoric, Stamper continues, effortlessly weaving together nationalist 
interests with an international populist movement. 
The American strategist showed his true caliber by expounding modern methods of political freedom 
through blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies, Stamper said, leaving many of his hearers behind. 
Bannon has demonstrated that if the right wants to rule the future, it must dominate modern themes and 
rhetorically position them, he added. 
Aspiring to be far more than an uncle who tells stories to his nephews of how he won the fight for the White 
House, Stamper writes, Bannon wants to become the super godfather of the international right. 
Although Bannon often looks a bit disheveled, he should not be underestimated, the writer warns. Past 
business partners attribute impressive strategic foresight to the eccentric tactician, saying he was often 
three or four steps ahead of his opponents in business. Because of his phenomenal memory, his nickname is 
the encyclopedia, Stamper notes with a certain reverence, and in his speeches he will spontaneously cite 
forgotten thinkers, known only to a handful of specialists. 
Bannon brings with him exclusive knowledge of power from the very heart of power, Stamper writes, 
which he will bring to bear on Europe's fragmented populist populism. 
According to Stamper, Bannon has established his European headquarters in Italy, from where he intends to 
galvanize European populists. 
The Italian political situation is completely to his liking, Stamper declares, with a political landscape 
dominated by populists, right-wing ideologues and the political puppeteer Berlusconi.

Knowing where you are will give you the answer to the “where is” question.

Recent developments in GPS positioning technologies could drive revenues from mobile location-
based services to more than $12.7 billion by 2014, according to a new report published by Juniper
Research.

Revenues will come from sales of apps through application stores and other channels, but also
from mobile advertising tied to those apps. In fact, the Juniper report notes that advertising will
likely form an increasing share of Mobile Location Based Services-related revenues over the next

five years.

The strategy was simple in outline: The Supreme Court should not be allowed the luxury of
deciding the issue of capital punishment as an abstraction; instead, it must be confronted with the
concrete responsibility of determining the immediate fates of many hundreds of condemned
persons at the same time. In this way, the Court could not evade the issue, or lightly refuse to
decide it if the Court’s refusal would result in the specter of mass executions of hundreds of
convicts. However, the Court could decline to decide the ultimate issue — the constitutionality of
capital punishment — if in doing so it could find some other way of keeping alive those on death
row. And the legal team always provided the Court with this other way — a narrower issue,
usually in the form of an irregularity in the procedure by which the death penalty was imposed or
administered.

Pursuant to this strategy, the Supreme Court decided a number of cases involving the
administration of the death penalty; in each of these cases the Court declined to consider the
ultimate issue, but it always ruled in favor of the doomed, thereby sparing their lives — at least
for the moment. With the passage of each year, the number of those on death row increased and
the stakes grew higher and higher.

Then in 1971 the Court took its first turn toward the noose: In Mc-Gautha v. California, it held
that a condemned person’s constitutional rights were not violated “by permitting the jury to
impose the death penalty without any governing standards” or by permitting the imposition of the
death penalty in “the same proceeding and verdict as determined

the issue of guilt.” At that point it looked like the string might have been played out: there were
no more “narrow” procedural grounds. The Court would have to confront the ultimate issue. But
it was not the same Court that had been sitting when the strategy was

originally devised; there were four new Nixon appointees, and it was clear that at least some of
them believed the death penalty to be constitutional. The umpires — if not the rules — had been
changed after the strategy of the game had been worked out and irretrievably put into action.
Now there was no pulling back.

The drama intensified. The Court let it be known that finally it was ready to decide the ultimate
issue. Knowledgeable lawyers—counting noses on the Court—were predicting that the death
penalty would be sustained by a narrow majority. Some thought that it might be struck down for
rape but sustained for murder. Some predicted that the Court would once again find—or
contrive—a reason for avoiding the ultimate issue. A few, of optimistic bent, kept the faith and
expressed the belief that the Court—even this Court—would simply not send hundreds to their
death.

And then a major and unanticipated break. The California Supreme Court — perhaps the most
influential state court in the nation —ruled that its constitution (which had substantially similar
wordings as the federal Constitution) forbade the death penalty. Then, on the last day of the
United States Supreme Court’s 1971 term, the decision was rendered in a case called Furman v.
Georgia. The death penalty, as administered in this country, was unconstitutional. The argument
proposed by Justice Goldberg on my first day as his law clerk had now been accepted by a
majority of the Justices. Goldberg called me in joy, offering mutual congratulations and crediting
me with implementing his idea. I was thrilled.

energy to unders tanding how the Control Factor ultimately sabotages us.

FP: Describe the threat we face in our Islamic enemy. And you talk about the three levels of jihad against us.
What are they?

Siegel: Simply stated, our Islamic Enemy seeks the totalitarian domination of Islam throughout the world —
Islamic supremacy. It seeks to have the West submit to Islam. Obviously, this does not mean that everybody
becomes a Muslim. Islam, in all its varied expressions, permits dhimmis- those Christians, Jews, and some
others who are permitted to remain as protected non-Muslims as long as they submit to an inferior status.
What is critical is that Shariah (Islamic Law) ultimately rules the world.

Jihad, loosely, is the effort/struggle to see this vision through. The most obvious method of Jihad is through
violence; it is the one most familiar to most Westerners and almost all of the Koranic references to Jihad are
based in violence. The Violent Jihad includes al-Qaeda and its offshoots as well as other groups that formed
around the globe independent of al-Qaeda. It also obviously includes the violence from Islamic nations such
as the Islamic Republic of Iran whose constitution specifies such vision. It also includes, however, various
militant groups and training camps here in the US as well as ad hoc efforts of individuals.

Since 9/11, there have been something in excess of 15,000 Violent Jihadic attacks across the globe.
However, as terrible as this is, we have a tendency in the West to think that the only dimension of threat we
face comes from violence. While the Bush administration helped initiate this thinking, the Obama
administration has actively abused it by limiting any discussion of the threat we face to al-Qaeda and some
other terrorist groups abroad. As frightening as these groups are, we can get some ease from thinking they
are a band of “extremists limited in number, weaponry, sophisticati on, and means. Stunningly, Hillary
Clinton recently estimated that there are only about 50,000 “homicidal” violent extremists around the world
who simply have been able to project power much greater than their number should allow. Here the Control
Factor makes the threat appear more easily manageable.

Jihad, however, is pursued in other often even more effective ways which I have grouped into three “levels.”
A second more insidious level of threat is what the Muslim Brotherhood itself called the “Civilization Jihad.”
It is the effort to infiltrate all aspects of our society, peacefully according to our laws, in order to later be in
position to sabotage and destroy it from the inside. The Civilization Jihadists have learned the culture and
rules of the territories they seek to command and use those rules to maneuver—specifically using our
freedoms to destroy our freedoms. They use “lawfare” to seek changes in our laws so as to push Shariah into
our society. Your readers should read Daniel Pipes and Brooke Goldstein’s Lawfare Project material and
others to fully appreciate how cancerous this activity has become. This includes intimidating in a variety of
ways anyone who speaks out against them or Islam and seeking to squelch our treasured broad right to free
speech so as to ultimately prevent any criticisms of Islam. Once criticism of Islam is prohibited, little can
stop it from cascading throughout the culture.

The Civilization Jihad includes situating such Jihadists in critical positions in the society, in the government,
in the legal system, the military, and elsewhere. It includes the control over university programs that
distribute propaganda about Islam and Islamic history which then filters down throughout textbooks for even
younger students. It includes control over most of the nation’s mosques and local Imams guiding the mess
ages engaged Muslims are receiving. Most troublesome are the Muslim g roups (CAIR, ISNA, MSA and
others associated and/or joint venture partners with the Muslim Brotherhood) supposedly interested in
“outreach” which know how to appear Westernized and interested in the goals of Western Civilization. They
have fooled a large part of our authorities and media due in part to their patience and willingness to chip
away, one airport prayer room, one frivolous intimidating lawsuit, one Congressman or CIA officer, one
mosque, one ruling at a time.

Particularly in the US, given our deep attachment to freedom as well as cultural and psychological tendencies
toward diversity, Western guilt and expectations of truthfulness, this effort is devious and difficult to uproot.
The Civilization Jihadists present one face to the American public which is completely at odds with their true
agenda and how they deal in private. Jamie, you and David and others such as Steve Emerson, Frank

perhaps the most important cause of today’s plague of polarization.

On Extreme Wealth

Some two hundred of the world’s wealthiest people have pledged to give away more than
50 percent of their wealth either during their lifetimes or in their wills, creating a plurality
of voices in the foundation space.*° Bill Gates is probably the most familiar example.
He’s decided that if the government won’t do it, he’ll do it. You want mosquito nets?
He’ll do it. You want antivirals? He’ll doit. We’re getting different stakeholders to take
action in the form of foundations dedicated to public good, and they have different
versions of what they consider the public good. This diversity of goals has created a lot
of what’s wonderful about the world today. Actions from outside government by
organizations like the Ford Foundation and the Sloan Foundation, who bet on things that
nobody else would bet on, have changed the world for the better.

Sure, these billionaires are human, with human foibles, and all is not necessarily
as it should be. On the other hand, the same situation obtained when the railways were
first built. Some people made huge fortunes. A lot of people went bust. We, the average
people, got railways out of it. That’s good. Same thing with electric power; same thing
with many new technologies. There’s a churning process that throws somebody up and
later casts them or their heirs down. Bubbles of extreme wealth were a feature of the late
1800s and early 1900s when steam engines and railways and electric lights were
invented. The fortunes they created were all gone within two or three generations.

If the U.S. were like Europe, I would worry. What you find in Europe is that the
same families have held on to wealth for hundreds of years, so they’re entrenched not just
in terms of wealth but of the political system and in other ways. But so far, the U.S. has
avoided this kind of hereditary class system. Extreme wealth hasn’t stuck, which is good.
It shouldn’t stick. If you win the lottery, you get your billion dollars, but your grandkids
ought to work for a living.

On AI and Society

People are scared about AI. Perhaps they should be. But they need to realize that AI
feeds on data. Without data, AI is nothing. You don’t have to watch the AI; instead you
should watch what it eats and what it does. The trust-network framework we’ ve set up,
with the help of nations in the E.U. and elsewhere, is one where we can have our
algorithms, we can have our AI, but we get to see what went in and what went out, so that
we can ask, Is this a discriminatory decision? Is this the sort of thing that we want as
humans? Or is this something that’s a little weird?

The most revealing analogy is that regulators, bureaucracies, and parts of the
government are very much like Als: They take in the rules that we call law and
regulation, and they add government data, and they make decisions that affect our lives.
The part that’s bad about the current system is that we have very little oversight of these
departments, regulators, and bureaucracies. The only control we have is the vote—the
opportunity to elect somebody different. We need to make oversight of bureaucracies a
lot more fine-grained. We need to record the data that went into every single decision

a weird lack of irony, given that I was going down on him regularly.

As the years passed, my frustration deepened and I started thinking about experimenting
more sexually, but I was terrified of mentioning it. I didn't know what I wanted to
experiment with -- I really believed that I'd already tried BDSM, and that I didn't like it
-- but his initial rejection of mere cunnilingus didn't make me feel confident.

Finally, I got to the point of directly asking for sexual experimentation, and we had the
worst fight ever.

I recall that our relationship was somewhat rocky already. One of my journal entries from
that time contains the sentence, I can't seem to not make him angry when I'm trying to
discuss our relationship. For this particular fight, we were sitting in his room reading
when I scraped together my courage and asked for his help in figuring out my sexuality.
Well, what do you want me to do? he demanded.

I don't know,” I said, but I think there must be some way to find out -- I don't know,
there have to be books?

That's ridiculous,” he snapped. I love you, but I'm not going to read books in order to
figure out how to have sex with you.

It got worse from there. I was crying within the first few sentences. At one point, he
outright shouted at me I don't care about your satisfaction, at which point I said, You
can't mean that, and he repeated it. Eventually, I simply turned around and walked out of
his room. I had nowhere to go; it was a long train ride to visit him, and the trains had
stopped running that day. It was mid-winter, and freezing cold. Crying, I put on my coat
and shoes and exited the house, onto his suburban street.

I walked completely at random. I was hardly able to see. Fortunately, because it was so
cold, no one else was out and about. I muffled my sobs by bowing my head into my
collar. After fifteen minutes, I discovered my cell phone in my pocket and tried to call my
best friend, but she didn't answer. I was still walking around crying an hour later, when
she returned the call.

She calmed me down and got the story out of me. It was the first she'd heard about my
inability to orgasm, and she didn't know how to advise me because she didn't have the
same problem. Also, it was obvious to both of us that trying to communicate with my
boyfriend wasn't working. It was obvious that there might be no way to successfully
communicate with him on this topic at all.

Eventually, after she'd managed to quiet me into a trembling jellylike mass, my friend
said gently, Okay, hon, you need to hang up and go back inside. She was right. So I
did.

When I stepped back into my boyfriend's room, he was still reading. I could sense from

THE BEST TIMES TO SEND E-MAIL

You’ve suggested people check e-mail only a few times a day. Here’s a twist: I reply to e-mails
when it’s convenient, but I time it to arrive when it’s also convenient for me. In Outlook you can
delay e-mail delivery to any time of day. For example, when I return e-mails at 3 p.m., I don’t want
my staff instantly zinging me responses or clarifying questions. (This also prevents e-mail chats.) So I
hit send, but it’s delayed to arrive later in the evening or at 8 A.M. when my employees arrive the
next day. This is how e-mail was meant to be! It’s mail, not a chat service.

“Normally, you make priorities clear” sounds like a backhanded insult. If this is a significant other,
you can skip this formality, but never use “you always do X,” which is just a fight starter.

A federal jury decided Thursday that one of the Middle East's most prominent banks did not commit fraud and 
steal technology from an Irvine firm that sued it for half a billion dollars in damages after their partnership 
collapsed. 
Orange County company InfoSpan had alleged that Emirates NBD ended a partnership for a mobile payment 
system because it didn't want to share revenue and stole InfoSpan's technology to launch its own service. 
The Dubai-based bank, in turn, denied it stole or ever used InfoSpan's technology. It argued that it cancelled the 
partnership because InfoSpan couldn't produce a working product and misled it into thinking it was an 
established company, not one with little to no track record. 
After deliberating for a day, the jury unanimously decided that InfoSpan did not prove its case of fraud and theft 
of trade secrets. 
InfoSpan had asked for $540 million in damages. An attorney for InfoSpan declined to comment on the 
possibility of an appeal. 
The verdict capped a two-week trial that involved dueling accusations of fraud levied by high-profile attorneys 
on both sides, including the former White House counsel to President Obama. 
At the center of the high-stakes battle was San Juan Capistrano resident and entrepreneur Farooq Bajwa and a 
mobile payment system that he said would allow migrant workers in the Middle East to send remittances back 
home through text messages. 
Bajwa contended that InfoSpan, with support from outside investors, spent $87 million developing the business 
and technology. 
To launch the system, known as SpanCash, Bajwa partnered in 2007 with Emirates Bank, which is controlled 
by the United Arab Emirates' sovereign wealth fund. 
It seemed the ideal collaboration for the Pakistani immigrant, who earned millions operating another Irvine 
company that manufactured computer components in the 1980s and 1990s 
The Gulf States rely heavily on migrants to work construction and other low-wage jobs, offering a ready-made 
market for SpanCash. InfoSpan aimed to allow migrants to transfer money back home far more cheaply than 
Western Union or hawala, a traditional Middle Eastern broker-to-broker money transfer system. 
A study from McKinsey & Co., cited in court records, projected annual revenue of $3.5 billion by the deal's 
fifth year, with InfoSpan receiving more than $2.8 billion in fees. 
But the relationship between InfoSpan and Emirates Bank soured and the bank cancelled the deal in 2009. 
A few days later, Emirates filed a criminal complaint in Dubai against Bajwa and a partner alleging that they 
defrauded the bank and misrepresented InfoSpan as an established business with a working technology. 
Two years later, InfoSpan sued in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana and alleged that its technology was working 
and that it delivered its source code to the bank on servers. Emirates ended the deal, InfoSpan said, to launch its 
own mobile payment system after stealing InfoSpan's technology. 
In court, an attorney for InfoSpan argued that Emirates torpedoed the InfoSpan relationship because it abhorred 
how much money it would have to share with the Irvine firm. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026005 
They wanted SpanCash and they wanted the money, attorney William A. Isaacson said in his closing 
arguments Wednesday. 
Isaacson — a partner with powerhouse law firm Boies Schiller & Flexner, chaired by high-profile litigator David 
Boies — argued that the bank resorted to pure extortion in an attempt to get its way. 
As a result of the bank's criminal complaint, InfoSpan alleged Bajwa's partner, Larry Scudder, was detained at 
the Dubai International Airport and taken to a cell where he was locked in with 30 other men for 19 hours until 
he secured his release by turning over his passport. 
According to the lawsuit, Bajwa tried to resolve the situation but was told Scudder's passport would be released 
and he could leave the country only if InfoSpan gave up ownership and control of SpanCash to the bank. 
Six months later, the bank withdrew the fraud accusations and Scudder got his passport back, but SpanCash's 
reputation was tarnished and it collapsed, Bajwa previously told The Times. 
The bank disputed that it acquired InfoSpan's source code or used it at any time. 
Former White House counsel and an attorney for the bank, Kathryn Ruemmler, said that Emirates never would 
have acquired source code in a joint-partnership deal like the one reached with InfoSpan. She said such 
technology would instead be held by a third-party escrow company for the length of the partnership. 
In her closing arguments, the partner with global firm Latham & Watkins told the jury that Bajwa and InfoSpan 
sold the bank a bill of goods, arguing that despite promises to Emirates, the technology never worked and 
InfoSpan wasn't as big a company as it claimed. 
The bank cancelled the deal and filed a criminal complaint, not as a form of extortion but simply to regain the 
bank's money after it was misled and doubts grew about the character of InfoSpan's employees, Ruemmler told 
the jury. 
They concluded, definitively, that they had been defrauded, she said. 
Lubna Qassim, group general counsel for Emirates Bank, said in a statement after the verdict that Emirates 
Bank is gratified by today's decision and the opportunity to receive a fair trial in U.S. courts. 
Bajwa said the trial has taken a toll on him and he doesn't know his next steps. 
I am just beat up, he said.

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022432.txt,"IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013651.txtmilligrams of amphetamine were administered to volunteer subjects every hour until
every subject crossed their particular threshold for personality change. The
graduate students underwent a global mind-brain-person transition at differing total
doses of amphetamine. The subject’s world was suddenly transformed into one of
enemies and friends. The syndrome dissipated over several hours when the drug
was stopped and the plasma levels of amphetamine and its metabolites declined.
As amphetamine makes memory formation and recall stronger, the subjects were
embarrassed when remembering what strange and forbidding yet uneatable things
they so strongly believed. These included such things as: they as good people were
caught in a network of bad person Russian spies; some threatening others arranged
for poison gas to be seeping out of the water faucet; the white coated scientists
were CIA undercover intelligence officers hoping to get information about their small
pornography collection. The subject's world had become divided in, for each
person, a stereotyped way.

After a couple of weeks of return to normal living, the experiment was
repeated. Each subject again developed his or her individually unique set of good-
guy, bad-guy delusional beliefs and at the same dose of amphetamine as before.
Like those of strong faith, their ideas once again resisted the logical arguments
made by the professional staff: that the new realities were neuropsychological and
had an obvious pharmacological origin. While on the drug, all stuck to their story,
even while being shown the movie record of their first drug-induced episode. There
is reliable scientific literature describing kamikaze pilots on high doses of
amphetamine in an ecstatic state of Shinto nationalism. With their planes loaded
with explosives, they deliberately crashed their planes onto American aircraft
carriers in the Pacific Theater of World War II. One wonders if these drug-induced
states occur in the drug-free condition in today’s abstemious Muslim suicide
bombers.

A more abstract and general way of thinking about the sudden emergence of
fixation, repetitiousness and splitting in feelings and thoughts involves the
emergence of regular /imit cycle oscillations in a complex system that was behaving

previously in a stable but flexible way. Locking up into a fixed, closed loop, is a

United Kingdom: A Fork in the Road

Much like the Eurozone, the UK economy is
notable for its resilience, evident in 15 consecutive
quarters of positive quarterly growth averaging
2.5% annualized. This streak is even more
impressive considering last year’s Brexit vote and
the resulting consensus view that the UK was
destined for recession. Although the 20% decline
in the trade-weighted sterling and rapid easing
by the Bank of England were no doubt pivotal in
avoiding that fate, the immediate impact of the
Brexit referendum has been far less destructive
than feared.

But as we begin 2017, the UK is rapidly
approaching a fork in the road. The government
must choose which path Brexit will take once it
triggers Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which
formally sets the process of the UK exit in motion.
Here, the government’s current objectives—limiting
freedom of movement into the UK while retaining
full access to the European Union’s single market—

UK authorities will have little room
to cushion a downturn given today’s
large fiscal deficits and already highly

accommodative central bank.

seem mutually exclusive and likely to engender a
politically charged negotiation process. This road
is made all the more dangerous by the fact that
UK authorities will have little room to cushion a
downturn given today’s large fiscal deficits and
already highly accommodative central bank.

Of course, a softer stance on the issues is also a
possible path, one that could elongate the effective
transitional period beyond two years and lead toa
far more benign outcome for the UK.

The uncertainty around the government’s
ultimate choices significantly increases the range of
GDP outcomes in the medium term. Our current
base case assumes GDP will expand by 0.5-1.5%
in 2017. This notable slowdown from last year’s
2% pace reflects the likelihood that both hiring
and investment activity will become more cautious
once the Brexit negotiations start. Even worse, this
slowdown arrives just as consumer price inflation
is accelerating from past sterling depreciation,
creating a lower growth/higher inflation backdrop
that is set to erode real income growth. For these
reasons, the risks to our central case are skewed to
the downside.

That said, the fate of the UK economy is not
preordained, even after the government chooses
its path. As with any other negotiation, the result
will ultimately reflect the reasonableness of the
parties, the concessions of both parties and how
the discussions evolve over time. Or in the words
of golf legend Arnold Palmer: “The road to success
is always under construction.”

Japan: Same Battle, Different Year

For Japan, the decades-long battle against deflation
never seems to end. Despite two years of above-
trend GDP growth, including last year’s 1% gain,
core inflation remains negative, having fallen 0.4%
in 2016 (see Exhibit 43). This comes despite a tight
labor market and record profits that should have
encouraged companies to increase base
wages. These already muted inflationary
pressures were exacerbated by low
energy prices and the appreciation of
the yen, once again pushing the Bank
of Japan’s (BOJ’s) 2% inflation target
further into the future.

But far from waving the white flag,
Japan’s policymakers responded with

a range of bold measures, including a

The jury at the second trial, having heard our new scientific evidence, acquitted Murphy of
murder. They believed neither the burking nor the cocktail theory. The more like cause of death,
they concluded, was a self-administered overdose of heroin. Murphy now lives in California,
where she runs an art gallery.

even though there was little other evidence of Binion's state of mind before his death. But
if the statement was relevant to show Binion's state of mind at the time he made the
statement, the exception still does not allow the statement to be used as evidence of the
intent or conduct of anyone else-in this case, Murphy. The district court did not give a
limiting instruction advising the jury that the statement was only admissible for the limited
purpose of showing Binion's state of mind.”

And I would think one phy sical constraint is to not let them in in the first place. By & quot;them I mean
those who have allegiance to a socio-political system disguised as a religion that seeks world dominance by
man imposed methodology/effort -- unlike Judaism and Christianity properly understood. If we are to

Japanese utility sector currently trades at P/B ratio of 1.0x with
the Tokyo regional electricity producer trading at a P/B ratio of
0.6x despite ¥10 trillion of possible unreserved liabilities
stemming from a 2011 nuclear disaster. Finally, Korean banks
are currently trading at a P/B ratio of 0.8x, which compares
favorably to Japan's 1.0x and Italy’s 0.9x. It is estimated that the
loan portfolios of the Korean banks have improved in recent
years as evidenced by improving ROE. In the most recent fiscal
year, Korean banks generated ROE of 7.7%, outperforming
Japan's 7.5% and Italy’s 6.7%.

These discrepancies in valuation have just started to close with
the new president and the formation of his cabinet, but Korean
market multiples have the potential to converge closer to global

not advocating that the new government implement heavy-
handed methods to incite change among the chaebols. Instead,
we believe that working with the chaebols in enhancing

Daily pays $250,000 for each insert in major US dailies. In 2009, the Global Times (48k
AY#R), part of the People’s Daily group, started an English-language newspaper as well.

Chinese investment in the US media market is not limited to the central government.
Chinese provincial media firms also have a footprint in the United States. Sky Link TV
(K Fi) is one example. It is fully owned by Guangzhou Media American Co, Ltd.
(2B RSA IRAs), which, in turn, is owned by GZ Television Media (7 N#WMERA
BR4S]), a Chinese state-owned media outlet. Sky Link’s story also illustrates the switch
from Taiwan money to mainland money in the US Chinese-language media world. Sky
Link was established in 1989 by a Taiwanese corporation. In 2009, it was purchased by
a private Chinese company; three years later, the Chinese state-owned GZ Television
Media bought Sky Link TV, a takeover that was hailed by the PRC’s Ministry of
Commerce as a key “cultural export” in 2014.'* When Sky Link TV reports on China,
the Sino-US relationship, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and other important issues concerning
China, it follows and quite often repeats verbatim the official line from PRC media. Its

major business partners include CCTV and Xinhua.

The Grand Overseas Propaganda Campaign has continued under the regime of General
Secretary Xi Jinping, who, in his 2014 New Year’s address, called on all media friendly
to the CCP to “better tell China’s story.” In March 2018, the Party announced plans

to unite these individual efforts into a mammoth overseas-facing propaganda organ,
known as the Voice of China, by merging the foreign operations of China Global
Television Network, China National Radio and China Radio International.” (It is not

clear whether the parallel with the Voice of America was intentional.)

Despite all of these efforts, President Xi still appears to be unsatisfied with the Party’s
efforts to “grab the right to speak.” In August 2018, the Chinese government announced
a shake-up in its propaganda organs, reflecting significant concern at the heart of the

Party that China was not winning its ideological battle with the West.”°

Diaspora Media

In the early 1990s, the state-owned China News Service and the Overseas Chinese Office of
the State Council dispatched editorial personnel to the United States to found the Chinese-
language TV broadcaster, SinoVision, and the newspaper Qiaobao (448). Shanghai's
Xinmin Wanbao sent staff to the United States to start up an American edition as
well. Chinese officials backed this push as part of an effort to fight back against the
negative publicity generated by the Party’s crackdown on protests around Tiananmen

Square on June 4, 1989,

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023403.txt,"In re: TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001., 2012 WL 257568 (2012)

in part due to the failure of States to achieve anything like consensus on the definition of terrorism.” Jd. at 97. But it did so
largely because there has been some disagreement among States on how to distinguish “terrorists” from “freedom fighters,”
and because the district court had rested its holding on the Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United
States instead of primary sources of international law. Jd. at 98-103, 107-08. Those concerns are not present here.

Any disagreement about how to characterize attacks by domestic attacks within a country by national liberation movements
is inapplicable to al-Qaeda’s international terrorist attacks on innocent civilians in the United States. See Almog, 471 F. Supp.
2d at 281; Bahlul, 2011 U.S. CMCR LEXIS 3 at *128. And the primary sources of international law discussed above reveal a
customary norm of international law that directly covers the acts of international terrorism alleged in these cases --
transnational attacks, *134 and the provision of material support for such attacks, on innocent civilians intended to influence
the conduct of a government or population by intimidation or coercion. That norm is no “less definite [in] content ... than the
historical paradigms familiar when [the ATS] was enacted.” Sosa, 532 U.S. at 732; cf Abdullahi, 562 F.3d at 184 (although
there are varying definitions of piracy, it is actionable under the ATS because “ ‘whatever may be the diversity by
definitions,’ ” there was a consensus “ ‘that robbery or forcible depredations upon the sea ... is piracy’ ”) (quoting United
States v. Smith, 18 U.S. (5 Wheat) 153, 159-61 (1820)).

Finally, international terrorism is clearly “capable of impairing international peace and security,” Mores, 414 F.3d at 249, a
factor this court has found to be “important” in demonstrating that the international law norm is of “ ‘mutual’ concern to
States,” and thus actionable under the ATS, Abdullahi, 562 F.3d at 185. The U.N. Security Council Resolutions specifically
state as much, see supra at Point n.b.2, and the United States invaded Afghanistan because the Taliban regime had supported
al-Qaeda prior to the September 11th Attacks. See Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 567-68 (2006) (discussing
Authorization for Use of Military Force, 115 Stat. 224 (2001)).

*135 For these reasons, there is a customary international norm against the commission of and provision of material support
for acts of international terrorism that is sufficiently universal, obligatory, definite, and of mutual concern to States to give
rise to a claim under the ATS. Thus, plaintiffs’ allegations that defendants purposefully provided financing and other forms
of material support to al-Qaeda to further its terrorist mission to attack the United States and its nationals state a claim under
the ATS, without regard to whether they also state a claim for aiding and abetting the September 11th Attacks. The district
court therefore erred as a matter of law in dismissing the ATS claims on the ground that they failed to allege that defendants
“ourposefully aided and abetted, conspired with, or materially supported al Qaida mm the commission of an act of terrorism
involving the hijacking of a commercial airplane.” SPA233 (Terrorist Attacks V) (emphasis added).

IU. The District Court Improperly Dismissed the Torture Victim Protection Act Claims

Plaintiffs also brought claims under the Torture Victim Protection Act (““TVPA”), which provides a cause of action for
victims of torture or extrajudicial killings perpetrated by “individual[s]” acting “under actual or apparent authority, or color
of law, of any foreign nation.” 28 U.S.C. § 1350 *136 note. The district court dismissed plaintiffs’ TVPA claims against
defendants Al Rajhi Bank, Saudi American Bank, and National Commercial Bank on the ground that corporate entities are
not “individuals” who may be sued under the TVPA. SPA52 (Terrorist Attacks I) (citing Arndt v. UBS AG, 342 F. Supp. 2d
132, 141 (E.D.N.Y. 2004)). This conclusion is incorrect, and the issue is likely soon to be definitively resolved by the U.S.
Supreme Court, which is considering a pending case presenting this issue.

As an initial matter, this Court has already indicated that an organizational defendant can be sued under the TVPA in
Khulumani v. Barclay Nat’l Bank. Ltd., 504 F.3d 254 (2d Cir. 2007). In Khulumani, the plaintiffs asserted aiding and abetting
claims under the TVPA against a bank for its participation in the torture and extrajudicial killings committed by the South
African apartheid regime. /d. at 259. This Court dismissed the TVPA claims on the ground that the plaintiffs failed to allege
that the bank had acted under color of law, but it did not question whether the bank was a proper defendant under the TVPA
in the first place. Jd. at 260. Based on Khulumani, the district court later held that a “corporation or other entity may ... be
subject to liability under the TVPA for aiding and *137 abetting” a principal violator. SPA210 (Terrorist Attacks IV); accord
SPA234 (Terrorist Attacks V).

More importantly, the Supreme Court recently granted certiorari in Mohamad v. Rajoub, 132 8. Ct. 454 (2011), which will
resolve a circuit split over whether the TVPA permits actions against non-natural persons. Compare Sinaltrainal v.

expectations by announcing a 25 bp rate cut (its first rate cut in 7yrs}, a further £60bn

the autumn. Unsurprisingly, GBPUSD fell further on the back of this. The better-than-
expected US nonfarm payrolls that beat all surveyed forecasts helped drive US markets
to new all-time closing highs also helped European equities rebound from a mid-week
trough. As a result, the V2X has retraced close to its 11 month lows as foreseeable

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013137.txt,"12.5 Clarifying the Ethics of Justice: Extending the Golden Rule in to a Multifactorial Ethical Model 221

And the concept of “setting a good example” ties in with an important concept from learning
theory: imitative learning. Humans appear to be hard-wired for imitative learning, in part via
mirror neuron systems in the brain; and, it seems clear that at least in the early stages of AGI
development, imitative learning is going to play a key role. Copying what other agents do is an
extremely powerful heuristic, and while AGIs may eventually grow beyond this, much of their
early ethical education is likely to arise during a phase when they have not done so. A strength
of the classic Golden Rule is that one is acting according to behaviors that one wants one’s
observers to imitate — which makes sense in that many of these observers will be using imitative
learning as a significant part of their learning toolkit.

The truth of the matter, it seems, is (as often happens) not all that simple or elegant. Ethical
behavior seems to be most pragmatically viewed as a multi-objective optimization problem,
where among the multiple objectives are three that we have just discussed, and two others that
emerge from learning theory and will be discussed shortly:

1. The imitability (i.e. the Golden Rule fairly narrowly and directly construed): the goal of
acting in a way so that having others directly imitate one’s actions, in directly comparable
contexts, is desirable to oneself

2. The comprehensibility: the goal of acting in a way so that others can understand the
principles underlying one’s actions

3. Experiential groundedness. An intelligent agent should not be expected to act according
to an ethical principle unless there are many examples of the principle-in-action in its own
direct or observational experience

4. The categorical imperative: Act according to abstract principles that you would be
happy to see implemented as universal laws

5. Logical coherence. An ethical system should be roughly logically coherent, in the sense
that the different principles within it should mesh well with one another and perhaps even
naturally emerge from each other.

Just for convenience, without implying any finality or great profundity to the list, we will refer
to these as the five imperatives.

The above are all ethical objectives to be valued and balanced, to different extents in different
contexts. The imitability imperative, obviously, loses importance in societies of agents that don’t
make heavy use of imitative learning. The comprehensibility imperative is more important
in agents that value social community-building generally, and less so in agent that are more
isolative and selffocused.

Note that the fifth point given above is logically of a different nature than the four previous
ones. The first four imperatives govern individual ethical principles; the fifth regards systems of
ethical principles, as they interact with each other. Logical coherence is of significant but varying
importance in human ethical systems. Huge effort has been spent by theologians of various
stripes in establishing and refining the logical coherence of the ethical systems associated with
their religions. However, it is arguably going to be even more important in the context of AGI
systems, especially if these AGI systems utilize cognitive methods based on logical inference,
probability theory or related methods.

Experiential groundedness is important because making pragmatic ethical judgments is
bound to require reference to an internal library of examples (“episodic ethics”) in which eth-
ical principles have previously been applied. This is required for analogical reasoning, and in
logic-based AGI systems, is also required for pruning of the logical inference trees involved in
determining ethical judgments.

territories. Even so, the PA remained highly dependent on U.S. aid,
receiving more than $400 million per year from Washington, and it
was unclear whether the PA and its president, Fatah leader Mahmoud
Abbas, could survive without it.

As a result, the U.S. Congress responded to Hamas’ 2006 electoral
victory by passing the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act (PATA), which
conditioned assistance to the PA on a presidential certification that
Hamas did not effectively control any “ministry, agency, or
instrumentality” of the PA and made “demonstrable progress” toward
five benchmarks related to transparency, democratization, and
antiterrorism. PATA provided a national security waiver that allowed
the White House to continue funding various entities in the PA
presidential office and judiciary branch, so long as Hamas did not
control the recipient. It also permitted funding to nongovernmental
organizations that provide aid to the West Bank and Gaza relating to
humanitarian needs and democracy promotion.

Ultimately, the dilemma over funding the PA resolved itself in 2007,
when Hamas broke with Fatah and the PA and took control of Gaza.
This separation freed OFAC to allow all transactions with the Fatah-
controlled PA in the West Bank. But should Hamas rejoin the PA as
a result of the recent unity arrangement, there may be pressure on
OFAC to take a tougher stance. Indeed, in recent appropriations bills,
Congress has made assistance to a “power-sharing government” in
Palestine contingent on compliance with PATA.

Congressional authorization to fund a Hamas-affiliated PA would
likely overcome existing legal prohibitions. In the face of PATA,
however, there is a substantial risk that providing aid without specific
congressional authority would violate U.S. criminal laws. Although
there are several arguments for exempting the PA from the U.S. laws
against dealing with FTOs, none is particularly convincing. To begin
with, it could be argued that although U.S. law prohibits individuals

Federal jury decides Middle East bank did not defraud Orange County entrepreneur<http://fw.to/aXv1QHI> 
[Farooq Bajwa] 
Farooq Bajwa 
By Andrew Khouri 
August 11, 2016 
A federal jury decided Thursday that one of the Middle East's most prominent banks did not commit fraud 
and steal technology from an Irvine firm that sued it for half a billion dollars in damages after their 
partnership collapsed. 
Orange County company InfoSpan had alleged that Emirates NBD ended a partnership for a mobile payment 
system because it didn't want to share revenue and stole InfoSpan's technology to launch its own service. 
The Dubai-based bank, in turn, denied it stole or ever used InfoSpan's technology. It argued that it cancelled 
the partnership because InfoSpan couldn't produce a working product and misled it into thinking it was an 
established company, not one with little to no track record. 
After deliberating for a day, the jury unanimously decided that InfoSpan did not prove its case of fraud and 
theft of trade secrets. 
InfoSpan had asked for $540 million in damages. An attorney for InfoSpan declined to comment on the 
possibility of an appeal. 
The verdict capped a two-week trial that involved dueling accusations of fraud levied by high-profile 
attorneys on both sides, including the former White House counsel to President Obama. 
At the center of the high-stakes battle was San Juan Capistrano resident and entrepreneur Farooq Bajwa and a 
mobile payment system that he said would allow migrant workers in the Middle East to send remittances back 
home through text messages. 
Bajwa contended that InfoSpan, with support from outside investors, spent $87 million developing the 
business and technology. 
To launch the system, known as SpanCash, Bajwa partnered in 2007 with Emirates Bank, which is controlled 
by the United Arab Emirates' sovereign wealth fund. 
It seemed the ideal collaboration for the Pakistani immigrant, who earned millions operating another Irvine 
company that manufactured computer components in the 1980s and 1990s 
The Gulf States rely heavily on migrants to work construction and other low-wage jobs, offering a ready-
made market for SpanCash. InfoSpan aimed to allow migrants to transfer money back home far more cheaply 
than Western Union or hawala, a traditional Middle Eastern broker-to-broker money transfer system. 
A study from McKinsey & Co., cited in court records, projected annual revenue of $3.5 billion by the deal's 
fifth year, with InfoSpan receiving more than $2.8 billion in fees. 
But the relationship between InfoSpan and Emirates Bank soured and the bank cancelled the deal in 2009. 
A few days later, Emirates filed a criminal complaint in Dubai against Bajwa and a partner alleging that they 
defrauded the bank and misrepresented InfoSpan as an established business with a working technology. 
Two years later, InfoSpan sued in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana and alleged that its technology was 
working and that it delivered its source code to the bank on servers. Emirates ended the deal, InfoSpan said, to 
launch its own mobile payment system after stealing InfoSpan's technology. 
In court, an attorney for InfoSpan argued that Emirates torpedoed the InfoSpan relationship because it 
abhorred how much money it would have to share with the Irvine firm. 
They wanted SpanCash and they wanted the money, attorney William A. Isaacson said in his closing 
arguments Wednesday. 
Isaacson — a partner with powerhouse law firm Boies Schiller & Flexner, chaired by high-profile litigator 
David Boies — argued that the bank resorted to pure extortion in an attempt to get its way. 
As a result of the bank's criminal complaint, InfoSpan alleged Bajwa's partner, Larry Scudder, was detained 
at the Dubai International Airport and taken to a cell where he was locked in with 30 other men for 19 hours 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030102 
until he secured his release by turning over his passport. 
According to the lawsuit, Bajwa tried to resolve the situation but was told Scudder's passport would be 
released and he could leave the country only if InfoSpan gave up ownership and control of SpanCash to the 
bank. 
Six months later, the bank withdrew the fraud accusations and Scudder got his passport back, but SpanCash's 
reputation was tarnished and it collapsed, Bajwa previously told The Times. 
The bank disputed that it acquired InfoSpan's source code or used it at any time. 
Former White House counsel and an attorney for the bank, Kathryn Ruemmler, said that Emirates never 
would have acquired source code in a joint-partnership deal like the one reached with InfoSpan. She said such 
technology would instead be held by a third-party escrow company for the length of the partnership. 
In her closing arguments, the partner with global firm Latham & Watkins told the jury that Bajwa and 
InfoSpan sold the bank a bill of goods, arguing that despite promises to Emirates, the technology never 
worked and InfoSpan wasn't as big a company as it claimed. 
The bank cancelled the deal and filed a criminal complaint, not as a form of extortion but simply to regain the 
bank's money after it was misled and doubts grew about the character of InfoSpan's employees, Ruemmler 
told the jury. 
They concluded, definitively, that they had been defrauded, she said. 
Lubna Qassim, group general counsel for Emirates Bank, said in a statement after the verdict that Emirates 
Bank is gratified by today's decision and the opportunity to receive a fair trial in U.S. courts. 
Bajwa said the trial has taken a toll on him and he doesn't know his next steps. 
I am just beat up, he said.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016406.txt,"That could be done for twenty-six different possibilities, but it couldn’t be done for ten
thousand. It was just a matter of scaling up the whole system that makes this possible
today. There are maybe five thousand picturable common nouns in English, ten thousand
if you include things like special kinds of plants and beetles which people would
recognize with some frequency. What we did was train our system on 30 million images
of these kinds of things. It’s a big, complicated, messy neural network. The details of
the network probably don’t matter, but it takes about a quadrillion GPU operations to do
the training.

Our system is impressive because it pretty much matches what humans can do. It
has about the same training data humans have—about the same number of images a
human infant would see in the first couple of years of its life. Roughly the same number
of operations have to be done in the learning process, using about the same number of
neurons in at least the first levels of our visual cortex. The details are different; the way
these artificial neurons work has little to do with how the brain’s neurons work. But the
concept is similar, and there’s a certain universality to what’s going on. At the
mathematical level, it’s a composition of a very large number of functions, with certain
continuity properties that let you use calculus methods to incrementally train the system.
Given those attributes, you can end up with something that does the same job human
brains do in physiological recognition.

But does this constitute AI? There are a few basic components. There’s
physiological recognition, there’s voice-to-text, there’s language translation—things
humans manage to do with varying degrees of difficulty. These are essentially some of
the links to how we make machines that are humanlike in what they do. For me, one of
the interesting things has been incorporating those capabilities into a precise symbolic
language to represent the everyday world. We now have a system that can say, “This is a
glass of water.” We can go from a picture of a glass of water to the concept of a glass of
water. Now we have to invent some actual symbolic language to represent those
concepts.

I began by trying to represent mathematical, technical kinds of knowledge and
went on to other kinds of knowledge. We’ve done a pretty good job of representing
objective knowledge in the world. Now the problem is to represent everyday human
discourse in a precise symbolic way—a knowledge-based language intended for
communication between humans and machines, so that humans can read it and machines
can understand it, too. For instance, you might say “X is greater than 5.” That’s a
predicate. You might also say, “I want a piece of chocolate.” That’s also a predicate. It
has an “I want” init. We have to find a precise symbolic representation of the desires we
express in human natural language.

In the late 1600s, Gottfried Leibniz, John Wilkins, and others were concerned
with what they called philosophical languages—that is, complete, universal, symbolic
representations of things in the world. You can look at the philosophical language of
John Wilkins and see how he divided up what was important in the world at the time.
Some aspects of the human condition have been the same since the 1600s. Some are very
different. His section on death and various forms of human suffering was huge; in
today’s ontology, it’s alot smaller. It’s interesting to see how a philosophical language
of today would differ from a philosophical language of the mid-1600s. It’s a measure of
our progress. Many such attempts at formalization have happened over the years. In

to free a hijacked airplane, I assumed we would face other operations which
were equally urgent, without the weeks or even months of preparation we’d
always insisted on in the past.

After the Sabena operation, I emphasized the need for us to be proactive. It
wouldn’t be up to us to decide which operations to do. But it was up to us to
take the initiative in identifying and understanding specific threats and framing
ways in which we could provide a response. Even before Sabena, barely two
weeks had gone by when I didn’t go to Eli Zeira, who was in charge of the
operations department of military intelligence, with a mission which I felt
confident we were ready to carry out. Several of the most complex centered on
the new threat posed by Palestinian groups in Lebanon. Before the civil war in
Jordan, King Hussein had accused Fatah, the PFLP and the equally militant
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine of trying to create “a state
within a state” and deliberately weakening his government. Now, they were
doing much the same in Lebanon. Their headquarters buildings in southern
Beirut were spawning hiyackings or terror attacks. From bases in southern
Lebanon, the Palestinians were also firing Katyusha rockets into Israel.

One of the operations I planned targeted Arafat. From our intelligence
intercepts, we knew that a day or two after a particularly intense clash with
Israeli artillery units on the Lebanese border, he would tour the area and meet
with his commanders. If we were going to go after him, however, we needed to
know exactly when he was coming. Fortunately, the Lebanese authorities
tracked Arafat’s motorcade on these “review the troops” excursions, reporting
how many cars were involved, which one he was in, and their progress. Thanks
to previous sayeret missions, we could listen in. In order to ensure the operation
would be on our terms, I proposed that a couple of days before we planned to
move, Israeli artillery target a Fatah rocket site in an isolated area about ten
miles from the border, where there was just a single road in from Beirut. I
proposed landing several teams by helicopter the night before. We would lie in
wait until the Lebanese army checkpoints reported that the Fatah convoy was on
its way. Israeli helicopters and F-4 jets would then cut off the road on both
sides, and we would ambush Arafat’s vehicle.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013123.txt,"12.2 Review of Current Thinking on the Risks of AGI 207

Formalization of human morality has vexed moral philosophers for quite some time. Finally, it is
unclear the extent to which such a proof could be created in a generic, environment-independent
way — but if the proof depends on properties of the physical environment, then it would re-
quire a formalization of the environment itself, which runs up against various problems such
as the complexity of the physical world and also the fact that we currently have no complete,
consistent theory of physics. Kaj Sotala has provided a list of 14 objections to the Friendly
AI concept, and suggested answers to each of them [Sot11]. Stephen Omohundro [Omo08] has
argued that any advanced AI system will very likely demonstrate certain basic AI drives, such
as desiring to be rational, to self-protect, to acquire resources, and to preserve and protect its
utility function and avoid counterfeit utility; these drives, he suggests, must be taken carefully
into account in formulating approaches to Friendly AI.

The problem of formally or at least very carefully defining the goal of Friendliness has been
considered from a variety of perspectives, none showing dramatic success. Yudkowsky [Yud04]
has suggested the concept of Coherent Extrapolated Volition, which roughly refers to the
extrapolation of the common values of the human race. Many subtleties arise in specifying
this concept — e.g. if Bob Jones is often possessed by a strong desire to kill all Martians, but
he deeply aspires to be a nonviolent person, then the CEV approach would not rate killing
Martians as part of Bob’s contribution to the CEV of humanity.

Goertzel [Goel0a] has proposed a related notion of Coherent Aggregated Volition (CAV),
which eschews the subtleties of extrapolation, and simply seeks a reasonably compact, coherent,
consistent set of values that is fairly close to the collective value-set of humanity. In the CAV
approach, killing Martians would be removed from humanity’s collective value-set because
it’s uncommon and not part of the most compact/coherent/consistent overall model of human
values, rather than because of Bob Jones’ aspiration to nonviolence.

One thought we have recently entertained is that the core concept underlying CAV might
be better thought of as CBV or Coherent Blended Volition. CAV seems to be easily misin-
terpreted as meaning the average of different views, which was not the original intention. The
CBV terminology clarifies that the CBV of a diverse group of people should not be thought of
as an average of their perspectives, but as something more analogous to a conceptual blend
[F'T02] — incorporating the most essential elements of their divergent views into a whole that is
overall compact, elegant and harmonious. The subtlety here (to which we shall return below)
is that for a CBV blend to be broadly acceptable, the different parties whose views are being
blended must agree to some extent that enough of the essential elements of their own views
have been included. The process of arriving at this sort of consensus may involve extrapolation
of a roughly similar sort to that considered in CEV.

Multiple attempts at axiomatization of human values have also been attempted, e.g. with a
view toward providing near-term guidance to military robots (see e.g. Arkin’s excellent though
chillingly-titled book Governing Lethal Behavior in Autonomous Robots [Ark09b], the result
of US military funded research). However, there are reasonably strong arguments that human
values (similarly to e.g. human language or human perceptual classification rules) are too com-
plex and multifaceted to be captured in any compact set of formal logic rules. Wallach [WA 10]
has made this point eloquently, and argued the necessity of fusing top-down (e.g. formal logic
based) and bottom-up (e.g. self-organizing learning based) approaches to machine ethics.

A number of more sociological considerations also arise. It is sometimes argued that the risk
from highly-advanced AGI going morally awry on its own may be less than that of moderately-
advanced AGI being used by human beings to advocate immoral ends. This possibility gives

Back at the Café Au Go Go arrest in New York, Lenny had told a
fantasy tale about Eleanor Roosevelt, quoting her, “I've got the nicest tits

was “Eleanor Roosevelt and her display of tits.” At the trial, Lenny acted as
his own attorney. He had obtained the legislative history of an Albany
statute, and he discovered that back in 1931 there was an amendment
proposed, which excluded from arrest in an indecent performance:
Stagehands, spectators, musicians, and--here was the fulcrum of his
defense--actors. The law had been misapplied to him. Despite opposition
by the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, the amendment was

finally signed into law by then-Governor Roosevelt, but to no avail.

This brainlike neural network was produced by the long history of civilization, whereas
the cellular automaton was created by my computer in the last microsecond.

The problem of abstract AI is similar to the problem of recognizing
extraterrestrial intelligence: How do you determine whether or not it has a purpose? This
is a question I don’t consider answered. We’ll say things like, “Well, AI will be
intelligent when it can do blah-blah-blah. ” When it can find primes. When it can
produce this and that and the other. But there are many other ways to get to those results.
Again, there is no bright line between intelligence and mere computation.

It’s another part of the Copernican story: We used to think Earth was the center of
the universe. Now we think we’re special because we have intelligence and nothing else
does. I’m afraid the bad news is that that isn’t a distinction.

Here’s one of my scenarios. Let’s say there comes a time when human
consciousness 1s readily uploadable into digital form, virtualized and so on, and pretty
soon we have a box of a trillion souls. There are a trillion souls in the box, all virtualized.
In the box, there will be molecular computing going on—maybe derived from biology,
maybe not. But the box will be doing all kinds of elaborate stuff. And there’s a rock
sitting next to the box. Inside a rock, there are always all kinds of elaborate stuff going
on, all kinds of subatomic particles doing all kinds of things. What’s the difference
between the rock and the box of a trillion souls? The answer is that the details of what’s
happening in the box were derived from the long history of human civilization, including
whatever people watched on YouTube the day before. Whereas the rock has its long
geological history but not the particular history of our civilization.

Realizing that there isn’t a genuine distinction between intelligence and mere
computation leads you to imagine that future—the endpoint of our civilization as a box of
trillion souls, each of them essentially playing a video game, forever. What is the
“purpose” of that?

"
IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012085.txt,"By early 2011, China had to cool the economy and tackle the
rising leverage and speculation. Policymakers also declared a
shift in China’s growth model to be more consumption-driven.
The transition probably turned out to be more complicated
than Chinese policymakers may have expected. Unlike the
infrastructure-driven growth model under which the pace of
growth could be controlled by adjusting the pipeline of
construction projects, a consumption-driven model would let
the “invisible hand” of self-interested consumers exert more
influence. In other words, a consumption-driven model would
cede more control to market forces and experience more
unpredictability. While variability in realized growth versus
projection is a fact of life in the rest of the world, Chinese
officials have sought to minimize this uncertainty as the failure
to hit growth targets could affect confidence.

With an estimated homeownership rate around 90% and many
families holding multiple apartments as investments, China's
housing market has an outsized impact on wealth, consumption
and construction, as well as the general economy. As shown in
CHART 1, the rapid housing price increases in 2010 and 2011
prompted regulators to cool the housing market, which resulted
in price declines in 2012. However, the slowing economy soon
pushed them to relax home purchase restrictions. Predictably,
housing prices rebounded as a response, with double-digit
increases in tier-one cities, prompting measures to tame the
bubble once again by 2014.

It is quite clear that there isa momentum-driven herd mentality
among Chinese buyers, as expressed in the Chinese adage “buy

up market, not down” (ik # F HK).

In an attempt to wean investors off real estate and channel their
capital to highly leveraged state-owned companies,
policymakers engineered a stock market rally in the second half
of 2014. As the rally gained momentum, the herd flocked in
(buy up market, not down) and pumped up a huge stock bubble
that eventually blew up by mid-2015. This was followed by the
renminbi’s official devaluation in August 2015 to alleviate the
pressure from the surging U.S. dollar.

Confronted with slowing economic growth, declining foreign
exchange reserves, rising capital flight, and a collapsing stock

market, Chinese policymakers shelved the reform agenda and
went back to the proven playbook—infrastructure and real
estate buildout. China even eased property investment rules for
foreign institutions and individuals. The result was perhaps the
biggest housing bubble ever in China’s tier-one cities—prices
surged over 30% year-over-year by the spring of 2016. It is as if
China was validating the old physiocratic economic theory
which postulated that the wealth of a nation lies in its land
development.

For years China has justified its rapid property price increases
on the basis that it is just catching up to global metropolises
such as London, New York, Hong Kong, Tokyo, etc. The latest
price surge has indeed accomplished that and more. For
example, a run-of-the-mill two-bedroom apartment in Beijing’s
financial district now costs more than $2,000 per square foot.
Skyrocketing domestic property prices have also distorted
many Chinese investors’ views of foreign properties—they are
bargains relative to prices in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen.
It is no wonder Chinese investors have bid up property prices
in many major cities around the globe. As a sign of the times,
Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices has
recently teamed up with China's Juwai.com to bring American
residential property listings to China.

An Under-Appreciated Reflation Story

According to a U.S. State Department memo released by
WikiLeaks, when Chinese premier Li Keqiang was serving as
the party secretary of Liaoning Province in 2007, he supposedly
told a U.S. ambassador that he did not have confidence in the
provincial GDP data. He preferred to monitor three indicators
to assess the state of the local economy: the rail freight volume,
electricity consumption and bank loan volume. In 2010, The
Economist introduced the Li Keqiang Index, which takes the
weighted average of these three metrics’ annual growth rates to
track Chinese economic growth.

The Li Keqiang Index has indeed tracked the direction of
China’s reported GDP data as shown in CHART 2. There was a
clear growth deceleration in 2015 and a strong rebound in 2016.

journalism, though his most revolutionary was his article, “The

the development of rock and roll, from slaves singing in chains
on their way to America to Bob Dylan “going electric” at the

Kretchmer had been discussing the possibility of publishing an
issue on rock and roll, so to make it happen, Kretchmer went
into the office at night and retyped the magazine’ s schedule to

include their ideas.

When the new editorial director started, Kretchmer handed
him the schedules and said, “Here’ s what we’ re working
on.” The new editorial director suspected nothing and the rock

notorious sex offenders.”

And yet the mighty and powerful, apparently evaluating the nature of
disgrace on their own terms, beat a path to his door. It’s a fantastic conclave
of influence in his dining room: financiers, billionaires, heads of state,
economic ministers.

He surely represents the kind of insiderism that is mostly just a
figment in outsiders’ fantasies. Except for the fact that, straining credulity,
Epstein is real. His is an ultimate sort of fantasy of power, wealth, and
secrecy. (In 2004, when the then owners of this magazine put it up for sale, I
was involved with a group trying to buy it—an effort in which Epstein
volunteered to invest $20 million. New York was subsequently sold to
another wealthy investor.) Were the International Jewish conspiracy to
actually exist, it might be here in his dining room (while not everybody in
his circle is Jewish, an obvious “think Yiddish” point of view prevails).

Without ever being asked to keep what I have heard here off the
record, I’ve willingly done so, least I not be invited back. And, too, to
protect him. Who would understand Jeffrey? Who could explain him?

Certainly Epstein’s past encounters with the press (and in many ways
with the entire outside world) have been about as disastrous as any could be,
helping to open a Pandora’s box of lifestyle vulnerabilities that sent him to
prison on a prostitution charge in 2008.

And yet here he 1s, in his 50,000 square foot mansion, dispensing
advice to world leaders and business titans.

Indeed, Epstein has been advising Bill Gates on a new way to increase
the already vast clout of the Gates Foundation by adding funds from other
wealthy individuals that can use the Gates resources (the Gates Foundation
now employs 1,200 people), but which can be directed to separate causes
and goals. And it is Gates who at the end of the summer began prodding
Epstein to begin a process of public rehabilitation.

Hence, as part of an effort to get “out in front” of the unfavorable
notice that might greet Gates’ public association with him, Epstein agreed to
several on the record conversation with me, in the hope, on his part, that,
after five years since his release from prison, he might be able to leaven his
reputation. And with the hope on my part of learning more about how and if
the rich are different than you and me (although we can fairly dispense with
the if).

MOTION BY MR. FRIED TO ASSESS A FINE IN THE AMOUNT OF
$100.00 A DAY FOR FOUR (4) DAYS FOR VIOLATIONS (A) FOR A
TOTAL OF $400.00 AND A FINE IN THE AMOUNT OF $250.00 A DAY
FOR VIOLATIONS (B), COMMENCING ON APRIL 15, 2008 AND
CONTINUING UNTIL COMPLIANCE IS ACHIEVED.

SECONDED BY MR. OCHSTEIN

During discussion on the motion, Mr. Fried told Ms. Fisher that although they
appreciated her testimony, fines had a way of giving people incentive and it was in
the Board’s discretion to reconsider the fine if compliance was done in an
appropriate time. Mr. Koeppel said he was going to make a similar comment
especially in a case such as this one where one form of repair was anticipated and
it became something significantly different. He thought the Board needed to take
that into consideration.

MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY

IX. Comments:

Mr. Fried said he wanted to revisit the subject Mr. Raffo had enjoyed so much over the
past couple of months, regarding outstanding fines. He requested an update on the
progress made in collecting some of them. Ms. Houston advised the outstanding water
restriction fines had been reduced to $6400.00 this month from over $9000.00 due the
previous month and liens were in the process of being filed for the remainder that had not
been paid. The non-running fines either had liens filed or were agenda items which are
pending. Cases that had substantial fines and were not homesteaded would be looked at
for foreclosure proceedings. The list of the daily running fines indicated which of those
properties were homesteaded and Ms. Houston indicated she anticipated bringing some of
those non-homesteaded properties to the Board for foreclosure consideration next month.

Mr. Fried asked about the motion made by Mr. Raffo at the last meeting, requesting the
Town Council to address the issue of giving final authority for foreclosure action to the
Code Enforcement Board. He asked for an update from Mr. Randolph or Ms. Houston as
to whether this would appear on the Town Council agenda. Mr. Randolph asked if the
minutes of that last meeting had been sent to the Town Council and Ms. Houston told him
those were the minutes that had just been approved today by the Board so they would
now be sent to the Town Council. Mr. Randolph said since these minutes had now been
approved, he would go ahead and call them to the attention of Peter Elwell and ask him to
agenda it on the next meeting of the Council. Mr. Fried asked that the outstanding fines
be prioritized for foreclosure starting with the largest ones first. Ms. Houston said she
would address the oldest and the largest outstanding fines first. She said she had also
waited, based on the motion from the last meeting because it would be a different
procedure if it was just brought to the Code Enforcement Board for approval or if it came
to them for final action. Mr. Randolph said it was his understanding that the Code
Enforcement Board wanted final approval as set forth in State Statute rather than just

Notification of Employee Rights Under
the National Labor Relations Act
AGENCY: National Labor Relations
Board.
ACTION: Final rule.
SUMMARY: On December 22, 2010, the
National Labor Relations Board (Board)
issued a proposed rule requiring
employers, including labor
organizations in their capacity as
employers, subject to the National Labor
Relations Act (NLRA) to post notices
informing their employees of their rights
as employees under the NLRA. This
final rule sets forth the Board’s review
of and responses to comments on the
proposal and incorporates any changes
made to the rule in response to those
comments.
The Board believes that many
employees protected by the NLRA are
unaware of their rights under the statute
and that the rule will increase
knowledge of the NLRA among
employees, in order to better enable the
exercise of rights under the statute. A
beneficial side effect may well be the
promotion of statutory compliance by
employers and unions.
The final rule establishes the size,
form, and content of the notice, and sets
forth provisions regarding the
enforcement of the rule.
DATES: This rule will be effective on
November 14, 2011.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Background on the Rulemaking
The NLRA, enacted in 1935, is the
Federal statute that regulates most
private sector labor-management
relations in the United States. 1 Section
7 of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. 157,
guarantees that
Employees shall have the right to selforganization,
to form, join, or assist labor
organizations, to bargain collectively through
representatives of their own choosing, and to
engage in other concerted activities for the
purpose of collective bargaining or other
1 Labor-management relations in the railroad and
airline industries are governed by the Railway
Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.
mutual aid or protection, and shall also have
the right to refrain from any or all such
activities[.]
In Section 1, 29 U.S.C. 151, Congress
explained why it was necessary for
those rights to be protected:
The denial by some employers of the right
of employees to organize and the refusal by
some employers to accept the procedure of
collective bargaining lead to strikes and other
forms of industrial strife or unrest, which
have the intent or the necessary effect of
burdening or obstructing commerce[.] * * *
* * * * *
Experience has proved that protection by
law of the right of employees to organize and
bargain collectively safeguards commerce
from injury, impairment, or interruption, and
promotes the flow of commerce by removing
certain recognized sources of industrial strife
and unrest, by encouraging practices
fundamental to the friendly adjustment of
industrial disputes arising out of differences
as to wages, hours, or other working
conditions, and by restoring equality of
bargaining power between employers and
employees.
* * * * *
It is declared to be the policy of the United
States to eliminate the causes of certain
substantial obstructions to the free flow of
commerce and to mitigate and eliminate
these obstructions when they have occurred
by encouraging the practice and procedure of
collective bargaining and by protecting the
exercise by workers of full freedom of
association, self-organization, and
designation of representatives of their own
choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the
terms and conditions of their employment or
other mutual aid or protection.
Thus, Congress plainly stated that, in its
judgment, protecting the rights of
employees to form and join unions and
to engage in collective bargaining would
benefit not only the employees
themselves, but the nation as a whole.
The Board was established to ensure
that employers and, later, unions
respect the exercise of employees’ rights
under the NLRA. 2
For employees to fully exercise their
NLRA rights, however, they must know
that those rights exist and that the Board
protects those rights. As the Board
explained in its Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking (NPRM), 75 FR 80410, it
has reason to think that most do not. 3
2 The original NLRA did not include restrictions
on the actions of unions; those were added in the
Labor-Management Relations (Taft-Hartley) Act of
1947, 29 U.S.C. 141 et seq., Title I.
3 The Board cited three law review articles in
which the authors contended that American
workers are largely unaware of their NLRA rights,
that the Board can take action to vindicate those
rights, and that this lack of knowledge stands in the
way of employees’ effectively exercising their
rights. Peter D. DeChiara, ‘‘The Right to Know: An
Argument for Informing Employees of Their Rights
under the National Labor Relations Act,’’ 32 Harv.
J. on Legis. 431, 433–434 (1995); Charles J. Morris,

The Board suggested a number of
reasons why such a knowledge gap
could exist—the low percentage of
employees who are represented by
unions, and thus lack an important
source of information about NLRA
rights; the increasing proportion of
immigrants in the work force, who are
unlikely to be familiar with their
workplace rights; and lack of
information about labor law and labor
relations on the part of high school
students who are about to enter the
labor force. 4
Of greatest concern to the Board,
however, is the fact that, except in very
limited circumstances, no one is
required to inform employees of their
NLRA rights. 5 The Board is almost
unique among agencies and
departments administering major

5 The Board requires that employees be notified
of their NLRA rights in only the following narrow
circumstances: (1) For the three working days
before a Board-conducted representation election,
the employer is required to post a notice of election
including a brief description of employee rights; see
29 CFR 103.20. (2) When an employer or a union
has been found to have violated employee rights
under the NLRA, it is required to post a notice
containing a brief summary of those rights. (3)
Before a union may seek to obligate newly hired
nonmember employees to pay dues and fees under
a union-security clause, it must inform them of
their right under NLRB v. General Motors, 373 U.S.
734 (1963), and Communications Workers v. Beck,
487 U.S. 735 (1988), to be or remain nonmembers
and that nonmembers have the right to object to
paying for union activities unrelated to the union’s
duties as the bargaining representative and to obtain
a reduction in dues and fees of such activities.

recognizes a union, the Board has required that the
employer must post a notice informing employees:
(i) That the employer recognized the union on the
basis of evidence that it was designated by a
majority of the unit employees; (ii) the date of
recognition; (iii) that all employees, including those
who previously signed cards for the recognized
union, have the right to be represented by a labor
organization of their choice, or no union at all; (iv)
that within 45 days of the date of the notice a
decertification or rival petition, supported by 30
percent or more of the unit employees, may be filed
with the Board and will be processed to an election;
and, (v) that if no petition is filed within 45 days,
the recognition will not be subject to challenge for
a reasonable period to allow the employer and
union to negotiate a collective-bargaining
agreement. Dana Corp., 351 NLRB 434 (2007).

54007
mstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2
Federal labor and employment laws in
not requiring employers routinely to
post notices at their workplaces
informing employees of their statutory
rights. 6 Given this common practice of
workplace notice-posting, it is
reasonable for the Board to infer that a
posting requirement will increase
employees’ awareness of their rights
under the NLRA. 7 Further support for
that position is President Obama’s
recent Executive Order 13496, issued on
January 30, 2009, which stressed the
need for employees to be informed of
their NLRA rights. Executive Order
13496 requires Federal contractors and
subcontractors to include in their
Government contracts specific
provisions requiring them to post
notices of employees’ NLRA rights. On
May 20, 2010, the Department of Labor
issued a Final Rule implementing the
order effective June 21, 2010. 75 FR
28368, 29 CFR part 471.
After due consideration, the Board
has decided to require that employees of
all employers subject to the NLRA be
informed of their NLRA rights.
Informing employees of their statutory
rights is central to advancing the
NLRA’s promise of ‘‘full freedom of
association, self-organization, and
designation of representatives of their
own choosing.’’ NLRA Section 1, 29
U.S.C. 151. It is fundamental to
employees’ exercise of their rights that
the employees know both their basic
rights and where they can go to seek
help in understanding those rights.
Notice of the right of self-organization,
to form, join, or assist labor
organizations, to bargain collectively, to
engage in other concerted activities, and
to refrain from such activities, and of
the Board’s role in protecting those
statutory rights is necessary to effectuate
the provisions of the NLRA.
The Board believes that the workplace
itself is the most appropriate place for
communicating with employees about
their basic statutory rights as employees.
Cf. Eastex, Inc. v. NLRB, 437 U.S. 556,
574 (1978) (‘‘[T]he plant is a particularly
appropriate place for the distribution of
[NLRA] material.’’).
Accordingly, and pursuant to its
rulemaking authority under Section 6 of
the NLRA, the Board proposed a new
rule requiring all employers subject to
the NLRA to post a copy of a notice
advising employees of their rights under
6 See, e.g., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e–10(a); Age Discrimination in
Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. 627; Family and
Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. 2601, 2619(a); Fair
Labor Standards Act, 29 CFR 516.4 (implementing
29 U.S.C. 211). 75 FR 80411.
7 As set forth in the NPRM, two petitions were
filed to address this anomaly. 75 FR 80411.
the NLRA and providing information
pertaining to the enforcement of those
rights. 75 FR 80411. For the reasons
discussed more fully below, the Board
tentatively determined that the content
of the notice should be the same as that
of the notice required under the
Department of Labor’s notice posting
rule, 29 CFR part 471. Id. at 80412. Also,
as discussed at length below, the Board
proposed that failure to post the notice
would be found to be an unfair labor
practice—i.e., to interfere with, restrain,
or coerce employees in the exercise of
their NLRA rights, in violation of
Section 8(a)(1) of the NLRA. Id. at
80414. The Board also proposed that
failure to post the notice could lead to
tolling of the 6-month statute of
limitations for filing unfair labor
practice charges, and that knowing and
willful failure to post the notice could
be considered as evidence of unlawful
motive in unfair labor practice cases. Id.
The Board explained that the burden of
compliance would be minimal—the
notices would be made available at no
charge by the Board (both electronically
and in hard copy), and employers
would only be required to post the
notices in places where they
customarily post notices to employees;
the rule would contain no reporting or
recordkeeping requirements. Id. at
80412. Finally, the Board expressed its
position that it was not required to
prepare an initial regulatory flexibility
analysis of the proposed rule under the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601
et seq., and that the notice posting
requirement was not subject to the
Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C.
3501 et seq. Id. at 80415–80416.
The Board invited comments on its
legal authority to issue the rule, the
content of the notice, the requirements
for posting the notice, the proposed
enforcement scheme, the definitions of
terms in the proposed rule, and on its
positions concerning the Regulatory
Flexibility Act and the Paperwork
Reduction Act. The Board stated that
comments would be accepted for 60
days following the publication of the
NPRM in the Federal Register, or until
February 22, 2011. The Board received
6,560 comments by February 22.
However, many late-filed comments
were also submitted, and the Board
decided to accept all comments that it
received on or before March 23. 8
8 March 23, 2011 was the date that the Board
downloaded all of the electronic and (pdf. versions
of) hard copy comments it had received from
http://www.regulations.gov and subsequently
uploaded into a text analytics tool for coding and
review.
A few commenters submitted their comments in
both electronic and hard copy form. Because all

In all, 7,034 comments were received
from employers, employees, unions,
employer organizations, worker
assistance organizations, and other
concerned organizations and
individuals, including two members of
Congress. The majority of comments, as
well as Board Member Hayes’ dissent,
oppose the rule or aspects of it; many
opposing comments contain suggestions
for improvement in the event the Board
issues a final rule. Many comments,
however, support the rule; a few of
those suggest changes to clarify or
strengthen the rule. The Board wishes to
express its appreciation to all those who
took the time to submit thoughtful and
helpful comments and suggestions
concerning the proposed rule. 9
After careful consideration of the
comments received, the Board has
decided to issue a final rule that is
similar to that proposed in the NPRM,
but with some changes suggested by
commenters. The most significant
change in the final rule is the deletion
of the requirement that employers
distribute the notice via email, voice
mail, text messaging or related
electronic communications if they
customarily communicate with their
employees in that manner. Other
significant changes include
clarifications of the employee notice
detailing employee rights protected by
the NLRA and unlawful conduct on the
part of unions; clarification of the rule’s
requirements for posting notices in
foreign languages; allowing employers
to post notices in black and white as
well as in color; and exemption of the
U.S. Postal Service from coverage of the
rule. The Board’s responses to the
comments, and the changes in the rule
and in the wording of the required
notice of employee rights occasioned by
the comments, are explained below. (In
his dissent, Board Member Hayes raises
a number of points that are also made
in some of the comments. The Board’s
responses to those comments should be
understood as responding to the dissent
as well.) 10
comments received are included in the numbers
cited in text above, those numbers overstate
somewhat the number of individuals, organizations,
etc. that submitted comments.
9 Many comments charge that the Board is issuing
the rule for political reasons, to encourage and
spread unionism, to discourage employers and
employees from engaging in direct communication
and problem solving, to drive up union
membership in order to retain agency staff, and
even to ‘‘line [its] pockets.’’ The Board responds
that its reasons for issuing the rule are set forth in
this preamble.
10 The Board majority’s reasoning stands on its
own. By its silence, the majority does not adopt any
characterization made by the dissent of the
majority’s rationale or motives.

II. Authority
Section 6 of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. 156,
provides that ‘‘The Board shall have
authority from time to time to make,
amend, and rescind, in the manner
prescribed by the Administrative
Procedure Act [5 U.S.C. 553], such rules
and regulations as may be necessary to
carry out the provisions of this Act.’’ As
discussed in detail below, the Board
interprets Section 6 as authorizing the
rule.
A. The Board’s Section 6 Rulemaking
Authority
Numerous comments dispute the
Board’s statutory authority to enact the
proposed rule. Many note the fact that
the Board’s rulemaking is constrained
by Congressional intent as evidenced in
its enabling statute. For instance, the
American Trucking Association quotes a
Ninth Circuit case explaining that
Section 6 ‘‘does not authorize the Board
to promulgate rules and regulations
which have the effect of enlarging its
authority beyond the scope intended by
Congress,’’ 11 and similarly, the Motor &
Equipment Manufacturers Association
asserts, ‘‘A regulation cannot stand if it
is contrary to the statute.’’ 12 The Board
agrees that it may not exercise its
rulemaking authority in a way contrary
to that intended by Congress, but for the
reasons discussed below it also does not
believe that it has done so in this rule.
Several comments assert that because
NLRA Section 6 is written in general,
rather than specific, terms, the Board is
not empowered to enact the proposed
rule. For example, Associated Builders
and Contractors argues that ‘‘the lack of
express statutory language under
Section 6 of the NLRA to require the
posting of a notice of any kind ‘is a
strong indicator, if not dispositive, that
the Board lacks the authority to impose
such a requirement * * *.’ ’’ 13 And the
Heritage Foundation likewise argues
that the Board’s reliance upon its
general Section 6 rulemaking authority
does not suffice to meet the
Administrative Procedure Act’s
requirement that the NPRM must

(1965).
12 Citing United States v. O’Hagan, 521 U.S. 642,
673 (1997). However, the Supreme Court actually
held there that an agency’s interpretation of its
enabling statute must be given ‘‘controlling weight
unless it is arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly
contrary to the statute.’’ (quoting Chevron U.S.A.
Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837,
844 (1984)). There, the Court upheld the rule and
found it was not arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly
contrary to the statute.
13 Quoting Member Hayes’ dissent, 75 FR 80415.
‘‘reference the legal authority under
which the rule is proposed.’’ 14
The Board believes that these
comments are in error because the
courts’ construction of other statutes’
general rulemaking authority, as well as
Section 6 in particular, fully support its
reading of this statutory provision. In
fact, earlier this year, the Supreme Court
issued a decision in Mayo Foundation
for Medical Education and Research v.
United States 15 (discussed more fully
below), unanimously reaffirming the
principle that a general grant of
rulemaking authority fully suffices to
confer legislative (or binding)
rulemaking authority upon an agency.
Even prior to Mayo, a long line of both
non-NLRA and NLRA cases supported
reading Section 6 in the manner
suggested by the Board. Over forty years
ago, in Thorpe v. Housing Authority, 16
the Supreme Court found that the
expansive grant of rulemaking authority
in Section 8 of the Housing Act was
sufficient to grant legislative rulemaking
power to the Department of Housing
and Urban Development. The Court
further noted that ‘‘[s]uch broad rulemaking
powers have been granted to
numerous other federal administrative
bodies in substantially the same
language.’’ 17 A few years later, in
Mourning v. Family Publication
Services, 18 the Court reaffirmed its
stance in Thorpe:
Where the empowering provision of a
statute states simply that the agency may
‘make * * * such rules and regulations as
may be necessary to carry out the provisions
of this Act,’ we have held that the validity
of a regulation promulgated thereunder will
be sustained so long as it is ‘reasonably
related to the purposes of the enabling
legislation.’ 19
Following the Supreme Court’s lead,
key circuit decisions then extended the
14 See 5 USC 553(b)(2). For this conclusion, the
Heritage Foundation cites Global Van Lines, Inc., v.
ICC, 714 F.2d 1290, 1297–98 (5th Cir. 1983). But
Global Van Lines did not find that a general
statement of authority can never meet the APA’s
requirements to specify the legal authority for the
rule. Instead, the Fifth Circuit held that that portion
of the APA is violated when an agency chooses to
rely on additional statutory provisions in support
of its rule for the first time on appeal, and those
grounds do not appear elsewhere in the
administrative record. See id. at 1298–99. Here, in
contrast, the grounds for the Board’s rule are clearly
laid out in subsection B, Statutory Authority,
below.

notion that broad grants of rulemaking
authority conveyed legislative
rulemaking power. 20 Although the
Board had historically chosen to make
policy by adjudications, the Supreme
Court, consistent with the non-NLRA
case law, used a pair of Board
enforcement cases to unanimously
emphasize the existence of the Board’s
legislative rulemaking authority, NLRB
v. Wyman-Gordon Co. 21 and NLRB v.
Bell Aerospace. 22
In 1991, after the Board enacted a rule
involving health care units, the
Supreme Court unanimously upheld
that rule in American Hospital
Association v. NLRB. 23 The Supreme
Court found that that the general grant
of rulemaking authority contained in
Section 6 of the Act ‘‘was
unquestionably sufficient to authorize
the rule at issue in this case unless
limited by some other provision in the
Act.’’ 24 As in AHA, there is no such
limitation here on the Board’s authority
to enact the proposed Rule, as explained
further below. As Senator Tom Harkin
and Representative George Miller 25
emphasized in their comment, the
Supreme Court in AHA examined ‘‘the
structure and the policy of the NLRA,’’
in order to conclude:
As a matter of statutory drafting, if
Congress had intended to curtail in a
particular area the broad rulemaking
authority granted in § 6, we would have
expected it to do so in language expressly
describing an exception from that section or
at least referring specifically to the section. 26
Thus, the Court could not have been
clearer that unless the Board is
‘‘expressly’’ limited in some manner,
Section 6 empowers the Board to make
‘‘such rules and regulations as may be
necessary to carry out the provisions of
this Act.’’ This point was underscored

in a Wagner Act-era Senate hearing, as
cited by Americans for Limited
Government (ALG), in which it was
acknowledged that the language of
Section 6 indeed grants ‘‘broad powers’’
to the Board. 27
And in January of this year, a
unanimous Supreme Court, in Mayo
Foundation for Medical Education and
Research v. United States, affirmed this
key principle that a broad grant of
statutory rulemaking authority conveys
authority to adopt legislative rules. 28
Mayo concerned in part the question of
how much deference a Treasury
Department tax regulation should
receive. In Mayo, an amicus argued that
the Treasury Department’s
interpretation should receive less
deference because it was issued under a
general grant of rulemaking authority, as
opposed to an interpretation issued
under a specific grant of authority. 29
The Court responded by first explaining
its earlier holding in U.S. v. Mead, that
Chevron deference is appropriate ‘‘when
it appears that Congress delegated
authority to the agency generally to
make rules carrying the force of law,
and that the agency interpretation
claiming deference was promulgated in
the exercise of that authority.’’ 30 Then,
in significant part, the Court observed:
Our inquiry in that regard does not turn on
whether Congress’s delegation of authority
was general or specific.
* * * * *
The Department issued the full-time
employee rule pursuant to the explicit
authorization to ‘‘prescribe all needful rules
and regulations for the enforcement’’ of the
Internal Revenue Code. 26 U.S.C. 7805(a). We
have found such ‘‘express congressional
authorizations to engage in the process of
rulemaking’’ to be ‘‘a very good indicator of
delegation meriting Chevron treatment.’’ 31
And so, all nine members of the
Supreme Court agreed on the following
key principle: an express, albeit general,
grant of rulemaking authority is fully
sufficient for an agency to receive
Chevron deference for its rulemaking. It
follows that a broad grant of rulemaking
authority will suffice for the agency to
engage in legislative rulemaking in the
first place. Thus, the Supreme Court’s

rulings continue to fully support a broad
construction of Section 6.
Disputing this conclusion, ALG
asserts that Section 6 was intended to be
used ‘‘primarily’’ for procedural
rulemaking, and cites a Senate report
from the Wagner Act’s legislative
history. That Senate report explains:
‘‘[i]n no case do the rules have the force
of law in the sense that criminal
penalties or fines accrue for their
violation, and it seems sufficient that
the rules prescribed must be ‘necessary
to carry out the provisions’ of the
act.’’ 32 The Board disagrees. The cited
language merely proclaims the obvious,
that no criminal penalties or fines
accrue for violating the Board’s rules.
However, laws such as the NLRA that
do not impose criminal penalties or
fines for their violation can also have
the ‘‘force of law’’ (which is perhaps
why the Senate report used the limiting
phrase ‘‘in the sense of’’). The Supreme
Court has previously recognized that
final Agency orders under Sections 10
(e) and (f) of the Act, despite their nonself
enforcing nature, have ‘‘the force
and effect of law.’’ 33 So too, do the
Board’s rules have the force and effect
of law, as held by the Supreme Court in
AHA. 34
Several comments discuss whether
Board Rule 103.20, which mandates the
posting of an election notice in a
workplace three working days prior to a
representation election, should be
considered analogous to the proposed
rule. The United Food and Commercial
Workers International Union (UFCW)
comments that the election rule is, like
the proposed rule, only minimally
burdensome and further noted that it
has never been challenged. 35 ALG
disagrees that the election rule should
be considered analogous here, because
although in the election context a notice
posting is the most feasible means to
inform employees about an upcoming
election that is occurring at a specific

place and time, that is not the case in
the NLRA rights context, in which
employees can just search the Internet
to find out more information. The Board
agrees with the UFCW that posting a
notice is a minimally burdensome way
to ensure that employees receive certain
information, although obviously, the
proposed notice will reach many more
employers over a much longer period of
time than do election notices. And
ALG’s acknowledgment that a notice
posting in the workplace is in fact
sometimes the most feasible means to
inform employees of important
information supports the Board’s belief,
explained below, that workplace notice
posting is a more efficient way of
informing employees of their NLRA
rights than relying on information
available on the Internet.
A few comments argue that the Board
is a law enforcement agency only, and
should not be engaging in rulemaking
for that reason. One comment asserts
that ‘‘Congress did not intend to
‘‘empower the NLRB to be a rulemaking
body, but rather an investigatory/
enforcement agent of the NLRA.’’ 36 The
Board responds that by enacting Section
6, Congress plainly and explicitly
intended to, and did, ‘‘empower the
NLRB to be a rulemaking body.’’ And,
as shown above, AHA conclusively
found that the Board is empowered to
use its rulemaking powers, as the Court
had previously indicated in Wyman-
Gordon and Bell Aerospace. 37
A joint comment submitted by
Douglas Holtz-Eakin and Sam Batkins
argues against the Board’s assertion of
Section 6 authority here by asserting
that ‘‘the Supreme Court has
circumscribed NLRB rulemaking in the
past: ‘The deference owed to an expert
tribunal cannot be allowed to slip into
a judicial inertia which results in the
unauthorized assumption by an agency
of major policy decisions properly made
by Congress.’ ’’ However, that comment
neglects to provide the citation for that
quotation, American Ship Building Co.
v. NLRB, 38 which was not a rulemaking
case but an adjudication. In any event,
the Board does not agree that this rule
presumes to make a major policy
decision properly made by Congress
alone. As explained in subsection B,

37 In National Petroleum Refiners Ass’n v. FTC,
482 F.2d 672 (D.C. Cir. 1973), the court rejected the
argument that the FTC’s prosecutorial functions
rendered it unsuitable for issuing rules. By way of
example, it noted that the NLRB is similar to the
FTC in its methods of adjudication and
enforcement, but the Supreme Court had repeatedly
encouraged the Board to utilize its rulemaking
powers. Id. at 684.

Statutory Authority, below, the Board
believes that it has been Congressionally
authorized to make this regulatory
decision in the interests of carrying out
the provisions of the Act.
Many comments argue that the Board
should heed the use of the word
‘‘necessary’’ in Section 6. For instance,
the Portland Cement Association
comments that Section 6 requires the
Board to demonstrate that: (1) The
specific rule being proposed is, in fact,
necessary, and (2) the adoption of the
proposed rule will carry out one or more
specific provisions of the Act. 39 The
Board believes, for the reasons
expressed in subsection C, Factual
Support, below, that the requisite
showing of necessity has been made.
And, as explained below, the adoption
of the proposed rule is consistent with
Section 1 and will help effectuate
Sections 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the NLRA.
The Board, however, disagrees with
the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers
Association’s assertion based upon the
case of West Virginia State Board of
Education v. Barnette 40 that the Board
needs to show ‘‘a grave and immediate
danger’’ before enacting a rule. First,
that case held that that very rigorous
standard of review is required only
where a First Amendment freedom is
alleged to have been infringed. The
Court further noted that where the First
Amendment is not implicated, the
government may regulate an area so
long as it has a ‘‘rational basis’’ for
doing so. As explained in subsection B,
Statutory Authority, below, this rule
infringes upon no First Amendment
interests, and consequently, the rule
should be judged on a standard similar
to the ‘‘rational basis’’ test laid out in
Barnette. It was in fact just such a
deferential standard which the Supreme
Court used to examine the Board’s
health care rule in AHA. There, the
Court found that even if it read Section
9 to find any ambiguity, it still would
have deferred to the Board’s ‘‘reasonable
interpretation of the statutory text,’’ and
found the Board authorized under
Sections 6 and 9 to enact the health care
bargaining unit rule at issue. 41 No
‘‘grave and immediate danger’’ was
found to be required prior to the Board
enacting that rule. This ruling was also
consistent with the Supreme Court’s
earlier holdings in Thorpe and
Mourning, in which regulations
promulgated under broadly phrased
grants of authority needed to be only

‘‘reasonably related to the purposes of
the enabling legislation.’’ 42 For the
reasons shown below, that standard is
more than met in the present rule.
B. The Board’s Statutory Authority To
Issue This Rule
The National Labor Relations Act
does not directly address an employer’s
obligation to post a notice of its
employees’ rights arising under the Act
or the consequences an employer may
face for failing to do so. However, as
stated, NLRA Section 6 empowers the
Board to promulgate legislative rules ‘‘as
may be necessary to carry out the
provisions’’ of the Act. 29 U.S.C. 156. A
determination of necessity under
Section 6 made by the Board, as
administrator of the NLRA, is entitled to
deference. See Ragsdale v. Wolverine
World Wide, Inc., 535 U.S. 81, 86 (2002).
Furthermore, even in the absence of
express rulemaking authority, ‘‘the
power of an administrative agency to
administer a congressionally created
* * * program necessarily requires the
formulation of policy and the making of
rules to fill any gap left, implicitly or
explicitly, by Congress.’’ Morton v. Ruiz,
415 U.S. 199, 231 (1974). Under the
well-known test articulated by the
Supreme Court in Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v.
Natural Resources Defense Council,
Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), courts will
defer to the Board’s reasonable
interpretation of a gap left by Congress
in the NLRA.
An examination of the provisions of
the whole law demonstrate how the
notice-posting rule is a legitimate
exercise of both legislative rulemaking
authority under Section 6 and implied
gap-filling authority under Chevron, 467
U.S. at 843. Section 1 of the NLRA
explains that Congress deliberately
chose the means of ‘‘encouraging the
practice and procedure of collective
bargaining’’ and ‘‘protecting the exercise
of workers of full freedom of
association, self-organization, and
designation of representatives of their
own choosing’’ in order to combat the
substantial burdens on commerce
caused by certain employer and labor
union practices as well as by the
inherent ‘‘inequality of bargaining
power between employees * * * and
employers.’’ 29 U.S.C. 151. 43 Section 7
42 Mourning, 411 U.S. at 369 (quoting Thorpe, 393
U.S. at 280–81).
43 These regulations are entirely compatible with
the national labor policy, as expressed in Section
1, ‘‘to eliminate the causes of certain substantial
obstructions to the free flow of commerce and to
mitigate and eliminate these obstructions when
they have occurred.’’ 29 U.S.C. 151 (fifth
paragraph). As explained below, the Board’s ability
to ‘‘eliminate’’ the causes of labor strife and
depressed wage rates, ‘‘which have the intent or
VerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2
therefore sets forth the core rights of
employees ‘‘to self-organization’’; ‘‘to
form, join, or assist labor organizations’’;
‘‘to bargain collectively’’; and ‘‘to engage
in other concerted activities’’; as well as
the right ‘‘to refrain from any or all such
activities.’’ Id. § 157. Section 8 defines
and prohibits union and employer
‘‘unfair labor practices’’ that infringe on
employees’ Section 7 rights, id. § 158,
and Section 10 authorizes the Board to
adjudicate unfair labor practice claims,
id. § 160, subject to the NLRA’s
procedural six-month statute of
limitations, see Zipes v. Trans World
Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 395 n.11
(1982). Finally, Section 9 authorizes the
Board to conduct representation
elections and issue certifications. 29
U.S.C. 159.
Notably, the NLRA does not give the
Board or its General Counsel roving
investigatory powers. Although the
Board is specifically empowered to
‘‘prevent’’ unfair labor practices, id.
§ 160(a), ‘‘[t]he Board may not act until
an unfair labor practice charge is filed
* * * alleging a violation of the Act.’’
2 The Developing Labor Law 2683 (John
E. Higgins, Jr. ed., 5th ed. 2006). In
addition, certification ‘‘procedures are
set in motion with the filing of a
representation petition.’’ Id. at 2662. In
both instances, the initiating document
is filed by a private party. Id. at 2683
(citing 29 CFR 102.9); id. at 2662–63
(citing 29 U.S.C. 159(c)(1)(A), (B), and
(e)(1)).
Enforcement of the NLRA and
effectuation of Congress’s national labor
policy therefore depend on the
existence of outside actors who are not
only aware of their rights but also know
where they may seek to vindicate them
within appropriate timeframes. The
Department of Labor made a similar
finding in an analogous rulemaking
proceeding under the Fair Labor
Standards Act: ‘‘effective enforcement of
the [FLSA] depends to a great extent
upon knowledge on the part of covered
employees of the provisions of the act
and the applicability of such provisions
to them, and a greater degree of
compliance with the act has been
effected in situations where employees
are aware of their rights under the law.’’
14 FR 7516, 7516 (Dec. 16, 1949). Given
the direct relationship between
employees’ timely awareness of their
rights under the NLRA and the Board’s
necessary effect of burdening or obstructing
commerce,’’ id., depends on workers’ knowledge of
their rights and the protections provided by the
NLRB. The Board therefore rejects the argument of
the Manufacturer’s Association of South Central
Pennsylvania that both the notice-posting rule and
the Board’s general assertion of rulemaking
authority are inconsistent with Section 1.
Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations
54011
mstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2
ability to protect and enforce those
rights, this rule is ‘‘necessary’’ for
purposes of Section 6.
Aside from the rule’s manifest
necessity, the notice posting
requirement fills a Chevron-type gap in
the NLRA’s statutory scheme. Thus, as
discussed, the purpose of Section 1, as
implemented in Sections 7 and 8, is to
encourage the free exercise and
enforcement of the Act’s provisions, and
fulfillment of that purpose depends on
the private initiative of employees and
employers to commence Board
representation proceedings pursuant to
Section 9 and Board unfair labor
practice proceedings pursuant to
Section 10. The effective working of the
NLRA’s administrative machinery
therefore presupposes that workers and
their employers have knowledge of the
rights afforded by the statute and the
means for their timely enforcement. The
statute, however, has no provision with
respect to making that knowledge
available, a subject about which the
statute is completely silent.
This statutory gap has always been
present but was of less significance in
earlier years when the density of union
organization was greater, since, as is
widely recognized, unions have been a
traditional source of information about
the NLRA’s provisions. See Lechmere,
Inc. v. NLRB, 502 U.S. 527, 531–32
(1992) (reaffirming that the Section 7
rights of employees interested in union
organization depend to some extent on
their having access to unions); Harlan
Fuel Co., 8 N.L.R.B. 25, 32 (1938)
(holding that the rights guaranteed to
employees by Section 7 include ‘‘full
freedom to receive aid, advice and
information from others concerning
[their self-organization] rights’’); cf.
Chamber of Commerce of the United
States v. Brown, 554 U.S. 60, 68 (2008)
(observing that Section 7 ‘‘implies an
underlying right to receive
information’’). Moreover, as rates of
unionization have declined, employees
are less likely to have experience with
collective bargaining or to be in contact
with other employees who have had
such experience. The statutory gap is
thus now important to the Board’s
administration of the NLRA and its role
in enforcing employees’ rights.
As the Supreme Court has observed,
The responsibility to adapt the Act to
changing patterns of industrial life is
entrusted to the Board. * * * It is the
province of the Board, not the courts, to
determine whether or not the ‘‘need’’ [for a
Board rule] exists in light of changing
industrial practices and the Board’s
cumulative experience in dealing with labormanagement
relations. For the Board has the
‘‘special function of applying the general
provisions of the Act to the complexities of
industrial life,’’ and its special competence in
this field is the justification for the deference
accorded its determination.
NLRB v. J. Weingarten, Inc., 420 U.S.
251, 266 (1975) (citations omitted).
Consistent with this understanding of
the Board’s role, the notice-posting
regulations represent an attempt to
‘‘adapt the Act’’ in light of recent
realities and ‘‘the Board’s cumulative
experience.’’ Id. The rule is wholly
consistent with the aims of the NLRA,
and the ‘‘need’’ for it now is heightened
given the ‘‘changing patterns of
industrial life.’’ Id.
For all these reasons, this rule is
entitled to deference regardless of how
it is characterized because it is
‘‘reasonably related to the purposes of
the enabling legislation,’’ Thorpe, 393
U.S. at 280–81, and constitutes a
‘‘ ‘reasonable interpretation’ of the
enacted text,’’ Mayo, 131 S. Ct. at 714
(quoting Chevron, 467 U.S. at 844).
In response to the NPRM, a number of
arguments have been made challenging
the Board’s statutory authority to
promulgate the notice posting rule. As
explained below, the Board does not
find merit in any of these arguments.
1. Limitations on the Board’s
Rulemaking Authority Implied by
Sections 9 and 10 of the Act
Of the comments that address the
Board’s statutory authority to issue this
rule, many express agreement with the
dissenting views of Member Hayes that
were published in the NPRM. Member
Hayes criticized the basis for the rule
and questioned the Board’s statutory
authority to promulgate and enforce it.
See 75 FR 80415. He specifically
referred to Section 10 as an obstacle to
the proposed rule, because it
‘‘indicate[d] to [him] that the Board
clearly lacks the authority to order
affirmative notice-posting action in the
absence of an unfair labor practice
charge filed by an outside party.’’ Id.
Many comments submitted in
response to the NPRM, such as those of
the Texas Association for Home Care &
Hospice and those of the Independent
Bakers Association, interpret Section 10
to prohibit the Board from ordering any
affirmative act that does not address the
consequences of an unfair labor
practice. Although this proposition may
be true when the Board acts through
adjudication—the administrative
function to which Section 10 directly
applies—it does not perforce apply
when the Board specifies affirmative
requirements via rulemaking under
Section 6. See Clifton v. FEC, 114 F.3d
1309, 1312 (1st Cir. 1997) (‘‘Agencies
are often allowed through rulemaking to
VerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2
regulate beyond the express substantive
directives of the statute, so long as the
statute is not contradicted.’’) (citing
Mourning). If it did, then the Board’s
longstanding rule mandating that
employers post an election notice three
days before a representation election
would be subject to challenge on that
ground. See 29 CFR 103.20; see also
Pannier Corp., Graphics Div. v. NLRB,
120 F.3d 603, 606–07 (6th Cir. 1997)
(rejecting an as-applied challenge to
§ 103.20). Furthermore, under American
Hospital Association, the Board’s
exercise of its broad rulemaking
authority under Section 6 is presumed
to be authorized unless elsewhere in the
Act there is ‘‘language expressly
describing an exception from that
section or at least referring specifically
to the section.’’ 499 U.S. at 613. Section
10 does not refer to the Board’s Section
6 authority.
Some comments, such as those of the
Council on Labor Law Equality
(COLLE), contend that the Board has no
authority whatsoever to administer the
NLRA unless a representation petition
or unfair labor practice charge has been
filed under Sections 9 or 10,
respectively. The Board declines to
adopt such a narrow view of its own
authority. Certainly, the Board cannot
issue certifications or unfair labor
practice orders via rulemaking
proceedings. But that is not what this
rule does. As explained above, by
promulgating the notice-posting rule,
the Board is taking a modest step that
is ‘‘necessary to carry out the
provisions’’ of the Act, 29 U.S.C. 156,
and that also fills a statutory gap left by
Congress in the NLRA.
Moreover, the argument advanced by
COLLE and others fails to appreciate
that the Board’s authority to administer
the Act is not strictly limited to those
means specifically set forth in the
NLRA. Rather, as the Supreme Court has
recognized, the NLRA impliedly
authorizes the Board to take appropriate
measures ‘‘to prevent frustration of the
purposes of the Act.’’ NLRB v. Nash-
Finch Co., 404 U.S. 138, 142 (1971). By
way of example, the Supreme Court
pointed out that its decisions had
recognized the Board’s implied
authority to petition for writs of
prohibition against premature
invocation of the review jurisdiction of
the courts of appeals, see In re NLRB,
304 U.S. 486, 496 (1938); to institute
contempt proceedings for violation of
enforced Board orders, see
Amalgamated Util. Workers v. Con.
Edison Co., 309 U.S. 261 (1940); and to
file claims in bankruptcy for Boardawarded
backpay, see Nathanson v.
NLRB, 344 U.S. 25 (1952). Relying on
54012 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations
mstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2
that precedent in Nash-Finch Co., the
Supreme Court concluded that the
Board also had implied authority ‘‘to
enjoin state action where [the Board’s]
federal power preempts the field.’’ 404
U.S. at 144. Like these judicially
recognized powers, the notice-posting
requirement that is the subject of this
rulemaking has not been specifically
provided for by Congress. But the cited
cases demonstrate that Congress need
not expressly list a power for the Board
to legitimately exercise it. Indeed, the
notice-posting requirement is not even
an implied power of the Board in the
same sense as those previously
mentioned. Rather, it is the product of
the Board’s exercise of express
rulemaking authority and inherent gapfilling
authority, both of which have
been delegated to the Board by
Congress.
2. The First Amendment and Section
8(c) of the NLRA
A handful of commenters argue that
the notice-posting requirement violates
the First Amendment to the
Constitution, Section 8(c) of the NLRA,
or both. For example, the Center on
National Labor Policy, Inc. maintains
that ‘‘compelling an employer to post its
property with a Notice that asserts the
statutory ‘rights’ and employer
obligations, runs counter to
constitutional views long protected by
the Supreme Court.’’ The Center also
argues that the ‘‘proposed poster would
impede the employer’s statutory right to
express itself on its own property.’’
Along these same lines, the National
Right to Work Legal Defense
Foundation, Inc. and others on whose
behalf it writes contend that ‘‘the
Board’s proposal for forced speech
favoring unionization directly conflicts
with the First Amendment and
longstanding federal labor policy under
Section 8(c) that employers and unions
should be able to choose themselves
what to say about unionization.’’ These
concerns were echoed by the National
Association of Wholesaler-Distributors.
In addition, two attorneys affiliated with
Pilchak Cohen & Tice, P.C., which they
describe as ‘‘a management-side labor
and employment law firm,’’ argue that
the notice-posting requirement
‘‘tramples upon employers’ Free Speech
rights by regulating the content of
information that employers are required
to tell employees and by compelling
them to post the Notice containing prounion
NLRA rights, when it is almost
assuredly not the employers’ prerogative
to do so.’’ The Independent Association
of Bakers goes further and characterizes
the regulation as an unconstitutional
‘‘gag order’’ that ‘‘prohibits the
employer from telling the truth about
the impact a union might pose to his
business.’’ The Board rejects these
arguments.
As an initial matter, requiring a notice
of employee rights to be posted does not
violate the First Amendment, which
protects the freedom of speech. Indeed,
this rule does not involve employer
speech at all. The government, not the
employer, will produce and supply
posters informing employees of their
legal rights. The government has sole
responsibility for the content of those
posters, and the poster explicitly states
that it is an ‘‘official Government
Notice’’; nothing in the poster is
attributed to the employer. In fact, an
employer has no obligation beyond
putting up this government poster.
These same considerations were present
in Lake Butler Apparel Co. v. Secretary
of Labor, 519 F.2d 84, 89 (5th Cir. 1975),
where the Fifth Circuit rejected as
‘‘nonsensical’’ an employer’s First
Amendment challenge to the
Occupational Safety and Health Act
requirement that it post an ‘‘information
sign’’ similar to the one at issue here. As
in Lake Butler, an employer subject to
the Board’s rule retains the right to
‘‘differ with the wisdom of * * * this
requirement even to the point * * * of
challenging its validity. * * * But the
First Amendment which gives him the
full right to contest validity to the bitter
end cannot justify his refusal to post a
notice * * * thought to be essential.’’
Id.; see also Stockwell Mfg. Co. v. Usery,
536 F.2d 1306, 1309–10 (10th Cir. 1976)
(dicta) (rejecting a constitutional
challenge to a requirement that an
employer post a copy of an OSHA
citation).
But even if the Board’s notice-posting
requirement is construed to compel
employer speech, the Supreme Court
has recognized that governments have
‘‘substantial leeway in determining
appropriate information disclosure
requirements for business
corporations.’’ Pac. Gas & Elec. Co. v.
Pub. Utils. Comm’n, 475 U.S. 1, 15 n.12
(1985). This discretion is particularly
wide when the government requires
information disclosures relevant to the
employment relationship. Thus, as the
D.C. Circuit has observed, ‘‘an
employer’s right to silence is sharply
constrained in the labor context, and
leaves it subject to a variety of burdens
to post notices of rights and risks.’’
UAW-Labor Employment & Training
Corp. v. Chao, 325 F.3d 360, 365 (D.C.
Cir. 2003) (UAW v. Chao) (citing Lake
Butler, 519 F.2d at 89). Accordingly, the
Board’s notice-posting requirement is
VerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00008 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2
not susceptible to a First Amendment
challenge. 44
The Board is equally satisfied that the
rule does not violate NLRA Section 8(c),
29 U.S.C. 158(c), which creates a safe
harbor for noncoercive speech in the
unfair labor practice area. Specifically,
Section 8(c) shields from unfair labor
practice liability ‘‘[t]he expressing of
any views, argument or opinion,’’
provided that ‘‘such expression contains
no threat of reprisal or force or promise
of benefit.’’ Id. (emphasis added). A
government poster containing accurate,
factual information about employees’
legal rights ‘‘merely states what the law
requires.’’ Lake Butler, 519 F.2d at 89.
For that reason, ‘‘[t]he posting of the
notice does not by any stretch of the
imagination reflect one way or the other
on the views of the employer.’’ Id. 45
44 The decision of the intermediate state court in
Smith v. Fair Employment & Housing Commission,
30 Cal. Rptr. 2d 395 (Cal. Ct. App. 1994), rev’d on
other grounds, 913 P.2d 909 (Cal. 1996), lends no
support to arguments challenging these regulations
on First Amendment grounds. There, the California
Court of Appeal held that a landlord’s right to
freedom of speech was ‘‘implicate[d],’’ id. at 401–
02, by a state fair housing agency’s remedial order
requiring her to sign, post, and distribute notices
‘‘setting out the provisions of [the fair housing
statute], the outcome of th[e] case, and the
statement that [she] practices equal housing
opportunity.’’ 913 P.2d at 914. The Smith case is
not persuasive here because the notice at issue in
Smith would not merely have set forth the rights
of prospective buyers or renters but also would
have contained a signed statement from the
landlord which would have given the false
appearance that she agreed with the state’s fair
housing ‘‘concepts and rules,’’ despite her religious
beliefs to the contrary. 30 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 401. That
feature of the case has no parallel here. Here, by
contrast, employers are not required to sign the
informational notice, and as noted, nothing in the
poster is attributed to them. The Board further notes
that the Smith decision is not authoritative because
it was superseded by the California Supreme
Court’s grant of review in that case. See 913 P.2d
at 916 n.*.
45 The Employers Association of New Jersey is
therefore off the mark when it argues that the
notice-posting requirement is preempted under the
principles of Lodge 76, International Ass’n of
Machinists & Aerospace Workers v. Wisconsin
Employment Relations Commission, 427 U.S. 132
(1976), as an attempt to regulate employer speech
‘‘about unionization and collective bargaining.’’ As
explained above, the employer’s choice whether to
express its own views, arguments, or opinions is
wholly unaffected by a requirement to post a
government-provided notice summarizing what the
law requires. Indeed, consistent with both
Machinists and the policy of Section 8(c) ‘‘‘to
encourage free debate on issues dividing labor and
management,’’’ Brown, 554 U.S. at 67 (quoting Linn
v. United Plant Guard Workers, Local 114, 383 U.S.
53, 62 (1966)), employers remain free under this
rule—as they have in the past—to express
noncoercive views regarding the exercise of these
rights as well as others. See, e.g., United Techs.
Corp., 274 N.L.R.B. 609, 609, 618–20, 624–26
(1985), enforced sub nom. NLRB v. Pratt & Whitney

(2d Cir. 1986); Warrensburg Bd. & Paper Corp., 143
N.L.R.B. 398, 398–99 (1963), enforced, 340 F.2d 920
(2d Cir. 1965). For this reason, the Board finds it
unnecessary to adopt the proposal made by the
Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations
54013
mstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2
But even if the new rule is understood
to compel employer speech, Section 8(c)
‘‘‘merely implements the First
Amendment.’’’ Brown, 554 U.S. at 67
(quoting NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co.,
395 U.S. 575, 617 (1969)). Thus, if a
First Amendment challenge to the rule
must fail, so too must a challenge based
on Section 8(c). Such was the holding
of the D.C. Circuit in UAW v. Chao.
There, the court was presented with a
preemption argument, grounded in
Section 8(c), challenging a Federal
procurement regulation that required
contractors to post a notice informing
their employees of certain NLRA rights.
The D.C. Circuit interpreted Section 8(c)
as coextensive with the scope of free
speech rights protected by the First
Amendment and upheld the
procurement regulation in light of wellestablished
free speech jurisprudence in
the labor context. See 325 F.3d at 365.
3. Lack of Contemporaneity With the
Enactment of the NLRA
Several comments attack the noticeposting
regulation for its lack of
contemporaneity with the enactment of
the NLRA. For example, many
comments criticize the regulation by
noting that ‘‘this is a new rule
interpreted into the Act 75 years after its
passage.’’ The Board rejects these
contentions for two reasons.
First, the Supreme Court has
repeatedly ‘‘instructed that ‘neither
antiquity nor contemporaneity with [a]
statute is a condition of [a regulation’s]
validity.’’’ Mayo, 131 S. Ct. at 712
(alterations in original) (quoting Smiley
v. Citibank (S.D.), N.A., 517 U.S. 735,
740 (1996)); see also Smiley, 517 U.S. at
740 (deferring to a regulation ‘‘issued
more than 100 years after the
enactment’’ of the statutory provision
that the regulation construed). Second,
the argument fails to consider that much
has changed since 1935, the year the
NLRA was enacted. Unionization rates
are one example. As pointed out in the
NPRM and as confirmed by comments
submitted by the Association of
Corporate Counsel’s Employment and
Labor Law Committee, unionization
rates increased during the early years of
the Act, peaking at around 35 percent of
the workforce in the mid-1950s. But
since then, the share of the workforce
represented by labor unions has
Pilchak attorneys to revise the rule to specify that
employers ‘‘may post a notice of equal dignity
which advises employees of * * * additional rights
and realities.’’ Alternatively, the Pilchak attorneys
propose that the Board amend the rule to permit
employers to ‘‘alter the Poster and include
additional rights.’’ Adopting this suggestion would
compromise the integrity of the notice as a
communication from the government. It, too, is
therefore rejected.
plummeted to approximately 8 percent.
As a result, fewer employees today have
direct, everyday access to an important
source of information regarding NLRA
rights and the Board’s ability to enforce
those rights.
As noted above, ‘‘[t]he responsibility
to adapt the Act to changing patterns of
industrial life is entrusted to the Board.’’
J. Weingarten, Inc., 420 U.S. at 266. It
would therefore be an abdication of that
responsibility for the Board to decline to
adopt this rule simply because of its
recent vintage. Accordingly, the Board
finds such arguments unpersuasive.
4. Comparison With Other Statutes That
Contain Notice-Posting Requirements
Many comments note, as the Board
did in the NPRM, that several other
labor and employment statutes enacted
by Congress contain express noticeposting
provisions. See 75 FR 80411
(listing such statutes). Though a few
such comments, such as those of the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters,
applaud the Board for ‘‘fill[ing] this
glaring and indefensible gap,’’ the bulk
of these comments instead argue that
the lack of a parallel statutory provision
in the NLRA negates the existence of
Board authority to issue this rule.
The Board notes that inferences
gleaned from side-by-side comparisons
to other statutes have diminished force
when an agency uses its gap-filling
authority under Chevron. There are
many possible reasons why Congress
did not include an express noticeposting
provision in the NLRA.
‘‘Perhaps that body consciously desired
the [agency] to strike the balance at this
level * * *; perhaps it simply did not
consider the question at this level; and
perhaps Congress was unable to forge a
coalition on either side of the question
* * *.’’ Chevron, 467 U.S. at 865. But,
‘‘[f]or judicial purposes, it matters not
which of these things occurred.’’ Id.
Indeed, the central premise behind
Chevron and its progeny is that agencies
should be allowed reasonable latitude to
fill gaps arising from congressional
silence or ambiguity. Accordingly, ‘‘the
contrast between Congress’s mandate in
one context with its silence in another
suggests not a prohibition but simply a
decision not to mandate any solution in
the second context, i.e., to leave the
question to agency discretion.’’ Cheney
R.R. Co. v. ICC, 902 F.2d 66, 69 (D.C.
Cir. 1990) (labeling the expressio unius
est exclusio alterius canon ‘‘an
especially feeble helper’’ in Chevron
cases).
Arguments contrasting the NLRA with
other federal enactments that contain
notice-posting requirements might have
some persuasive force if there were
VerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00009 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2
evidence that Congress had considered
and rejected inserting such a
requirement into the Act. However,
nothing in the legislative history of the
Act so indicates. Indeed, there is not the
slightest hint that the omission of a
notice-posting requirement was the
product of legislative compromise and
therefore implies congressional rejection
of the idea. Cf. Ind. Prot. & Advocacy
Servs. v. Ind. Family & Soc. Servs.
Admin., 603 F.3d 365, 384–85 (7th Cir.
2010) (en banc) (Posner, J., concurring)
(inferring a private right of action from
statutory silence in a case where such
silence was not the product of
‘‘legislative compromise’’). For these
reasons, the Board rejects the Motor and
Equipment Manufacturers Association’s
unsupported suggestion that there has
been an affirmative ‘‘legislative
determination not to include a posting
requirement by employers that have not
violated the Act.’’
A number of comments point out that
Congress included a general noticeposting
provision in the Railway Labor
Act (RLA), which predates the NLRA.
Given the relative proximity of these
two enactments, some comments regard
the absence of a notice-posting
provision in the NLRA as strong
evidence that Congress did not intend
for there to be one. For reasons just
explained, the Board does not find a
side-by-side comparison with the RLA
availing. In addition, the Board notes
that although the NLRA and the RLA
share several common features, the
NLRA was not perfectly modeled after
the RLA. See Bhd. of R.R. Trainmen v.
Chi. River & Ind. R.R. Co., 353 U.S. 30,
31 n.2 (1957) (‘‘The relationship of labor
and management in the railroad
industry has developed on a pattern
different from other industries. The
fundamental premises and principles of
the Railway Labor Act are not the same
as those which form the basis of the
National Labor Relations Act * * *.’’).
Finally, the Board notes that other
federal departments and agencies have
not understood Congress’s failure to
include an express provision containing
a notice-posting requirement in a federal
labor or employment statute as a bar to
such a regulatory requirement. Like the
NLRA, the Fair Labor Standards Act
(FLSA), which was passed in 1938, does
not contain a provision requiring
employers to post a notice of pertinent
employee rights. Yet the Department of
Labor adopted a notice requirement now
codified at 29 CFR 516.4. Furthermore,
the Board is unaware of any challenge
to the Labor Department’s authority to
promulgate or enforce the FLSA notice
requirement, which has been in effect
for over 60 years. See 14 FR 7516 (Dec.
54014 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations
mstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2
16, 1949), promulgating 29 CFR 516.18,
the predecessor to 29 CFR 516.4.
5. The Teamsters 357 Decision
In response to the NPRM, the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce submitted a
comment that questions ‘‘how the
proposal can be said to be consistent
with’’ the Supreme Court’s decision in
Local 357, International Brotherhood of
Teamsters v. NLRB, 365 U.S. 667 (1961).
Specifically, the Chamber accuses the
Board of ignoring the Court’s
admonition in that case warning that
‘‘[w]here * * * Congress has aimed its
sanctions only at specific discriminatory
practices, the Board cannot go farther
and establish a broader, more pervasive
regulatory scheme.’’ Id. at 675. The
Chamber reads this statement out of
context.
To understand why the Board
disagrees with the Chamber’s view,
further explanation of Teamsters 357 is
necessary. In that case, the Supreme
Court rejected the Board’s conclusion
that a union had committed an unfair
labor practice by operating an exclusive
hiring hall pursuant to an agreement
that contained a nondiscrimination
clause but not three additional clauses
that the Board had previously declared
in its Mountain Pacific decision to be
necessary to prevent ‘‘ ‘unlawful
encouragement of union membership.’ ’’
Id. at 671 (quoting Mountain Pacific
Chapter, 119 NLRB 883, 897 (1958)).
The Court first noted that Congress had
examined the operation of hiring halls
and had decided not to ban them. Id. at
673–74. Next, the Court observed that
NLRA Section 8(a)(3) ‘‘ ‘does not outlaw
all encouragement or discouragement of
membership in labor organizations; only
such as is accomplished by
discrimination is prohibited.’ ’’ Id. at
674–75 (emphasis added) (quoting
Radio Officers’ Union v. NLRB, 347 U.S.
17, 42–43 (1954)). Since the hiring hall
agreement at issue in Teamsters 357
‘‘specifically provide[d] that there will
be no discrimination * * * because of
the presence or absence of union
membership,’’ the Court determined
that the Board was attempting to protect
against nondiscriminatory
encouragement of union membership.
Id. at 675. This was impermissible
because ‘‘[w]here * * * Congress has
aimed its sanctions only at specific
discriminatory practices, the Board
cannot go farther and establish a
broader, more pervasive regulatory
scheme.’’ Id. at 676.
Properly understood, Teamsters 357
does not preclude the Board from
issuing the notice posting rule. The
union had not committed an unfair
labor practice in that case because its
hiring hall agreement did not encourage
or discourage union membership by
‘‘discrimination.’’ See id. at 674–75. By
faulting the union for not including in
its agreement clauses that the Board’s
Mountain Pacific rule had declared
necessary to prevent ‘‘ ‘unlawful
encouragement of union membership,’ ’’
id. at 671 (quoting Mountain Pacific
Chapter, 119 NLRB at 897), the Board
had attempted to regulate hiring halls in
a manner that was facially inconsistent
with the discrimination requirement
embedded in NLRA Section 8(a)(3) and
(b)(2). Accordingly, the Chamber makes
too much of the Court’s statement
prohibiting the Board from
‘‘establish[ing] a broader, more
pervasive regulatory scheme’’ when
‘‘specific discriminatory practices’’ have
already been outlawed. Id. at 676. By
that, the Court simply meant to remind
the Board that it may not
administratively amend Section 8(a)(3)
and (b)(2) to prohibit nondiscriminatory
activity that might be viewed as
undesirable because those statutory
sections are clearly aimed only at
‘‘specific discriminatory practices.’’
Id. 46
This rulemaking does not involve
those provisions of the NLRA that
Teamsters 357 addressed. Accordingly,
the Board does not view that case as
controlling the outcome of this
proceeding.
6. Miscellaneous Matters
The Center on National Labor Policy,
Inc., argues that the Board ‘‘must be
mindful of the Supreme Court’s
admonition in Lechmere[, Inc.] v. NLRB,
502 U.S. 527, 534 (1992), that an
employer possesses First Amendment
rights to its property.’’ The Board
disagrees that the property rights
discussed in Lechmere emanate from
the First Amendment, see Thunder
Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200,
217 n.21 (1994) (‘‘The right of
employers to exclude union organizers
from their private property emanates
from state common law * * *.’’), and to
the extent that the Center’s reference to
the First Amendment asserts a conflict
between these regulations and
employers’ right to free speech, that
argument is rejected for reasons
explained above. After quoting
extensively from Lechmere, the Center
next contends that ‘‘if a union has no
access to company property to
communicate with employees, neither
46 To the extent that the Board espoused a
contrary view of Teamsters 357 in a prior
rulemaking proceeding, that view is abandoned. See
Union Dues Regulation, 57 FR 43635, 43637–38
(Sept. 22, 1992), withdrawn, 61 FR 11167 (Mar. 19,
1996).

does the Board without Section 10(c)
authority.’’ The Board rejects this
argument because it fails to recognize
the important substantive difference
between the conduct at issue in
Lechmere, which involved ‘‘ ‘trespassory
organizational activity’ ’’ by
nonemployees on the employer’s
grounds, id. at 535 (quoting Sears,
Roebuck & Co. v. San Diego Dist.
Council of Carpenters, 436 U.S. 180, 205
(1978)), and the regulations here which
involve nothing more than the
employer’s responsibility to post an
official notice of legal rights.
The Portland Cement Association
(PCA) comments that the Board’s failure
to place the three law review articles
that the Board cited to the NPRM 47 in
the administrative docket is arbitrary
and capricious. Although the Board
provided the legal citations for these
articles, PCA believes that it should not
have to pay an electronic legal reporting
service to access the material. The Board
has placed these articles in the hard
copy docket, but has not uploaded these
articles to the electronic docket at
http://www.regulations.gov, because
such an action could violate copyright
laws. 48
Finally, one comment contends that
requiring employers to set aside wall
space for posting the notices violates the
Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment
to the U.S. Constitution. The comment
cites no authority for this proposition,
which would seem to invalidate the
notice-posting requirements under all
other Federal and state workplace
statutes. Accordingly, the Board rejects
this contention.
In conclusion, the Board believe that
it has fully demonstrated that it
possesses sufficient statutory authority
to enact the final rule, and therefore that
it is not ‘‘in excess of statutory
jurisdiction’’ or ‘‘short of statutory
right’’ within the meaning of the
Administrative Procedure Act, Section
706(2)(C), 5 U.S.C. 706(2)(C).
C. Factual Support for the Rule
As stated above, the Board found that
the notice posting rule is needed
because it believes that many employees
are unaware of their NLRA rights and
therefore cannot effectively exercise
those rights. The Board based this
finding on several factors: the
comparatively small percentage of
private sector employees who are
represented by unions and thus have
ready access to information about the
47 See NPRM, 75 FR 80411 and fn. 3 above.
48 The Board has also placed the other non-case
materials cited to in this final rule into the hard
copy docket.
Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations
54015

NLRA; the high percentage of
immigrants in the labor force, who are
likely to be unfamiliar with workplace
rights in the United States; studies
indicating that employees and high
school students about to enter the work
force are generally uninformed about
labor law; and the absence of a
requirement that, except in very limited
circumstances, employers or anyone
else inform employees about their
NLRA rights. 75 FR 80411.
A large number of comments contend
that the Board failed to demonstrate the
necessity of the notice posting rule.
They challenge each of the premises
(except the last) underlying the Board’s
belief that employees are generally
unaware of their NLRA rights.
Many comments assert that, contrary
to the Board’s belief, the right to join a
union is widely known and understood
by employees. For example:
—I believe the majority of employees know
about labor unions and how to form a
union, and this poster is unnecessary. 49
—[I]t is hard to imagine that there are many
in the US who do not know that they can
try to join a union.
—The fact of the matter is that if a group of
employees are upset enough with their
current management that they feel they
need union representation, they already
know what they need to do as a recourse.
And if they do not immediately know how
to respond, there are plenty of resources for
them. 50
—We, the employees, know the unions exist,
* * * If the employees want to know about
unions, they should research it themselves.
It is not as though the information is not
readily available.
Some posit that comparatively few
private sector employees are
represented by unions not because
employees do not know that they can
join unions, but because they have
consciously rejected union
representation for any number of
reasons (e.g., they do not believe that
unions can help them; they do not want
to pay union dues; they deem union
representation unnecessary in light of
other workplace protection statutes). For
example:
—Is it not just as probable that people clearly
understand unions, and they have decided
they want no part of them?
—Labor unions charge approximately 1.3%
of pre-tax earnings for monthly dues. Many
workers, especially those who lost their
good paying jobs during this recession and
have found new jobs at $10.00-$11.00 per
hour wages, need the dues money
themselves, in order to support their
families.
49 Comment of the Employers Association.
50 Comment of Malt-O-Meal Company (Malt-O-
Meal).
—Membership is down because so many of
the good things unions fought for a long
time ago have been legislated, at either the
Federal or State level, and so the need for
unions has declined. 51
—[M]ost employees are very aware of their
rights to unionize and many employees
choose not to do so because of the rights
they already have under our federal and
state laws.
—In fact, one could say that the NLRA and
other employment laws have succeeded to
the degree that unions are NOT necessary
in today’s work environment. 52
A few comments question the Board’s
belief that immigrant workers are
unfamiliar with their workplace
rights. 53 Several comments argue that
the NLRA has been in effect for nearly
76 years, which is sufficient time for
employees to learn about its
provisions. 54
A number of comments argue that the
studies cited in the NPRM are from the
late 1980s and early 1990s and are
therefore out of date 55 (and also, some
say, poorly supported). 56 Moreover,
those studies, whatever their value
when published, predate the wide use
of the internet. Now there are many
online sources of information
concerning unions and union
organizing, including the Board’s own
Web site. According to these comments,
it should not be necessary to require
employers to post notices of NLRA
rights because employees who are
interested in learning about unions can
quickly and easily find such
information online. 57 One comment,
like some others, argues that ‘‘If it is so
important that employees know their
rights under the NLRB it should be the
government or union whose
responsibility it is to inform them.’’ 58
Two comments suggest that the Board
conduct a mass media informational
campaign to that end, and one notes that
the Board has in fact recently increased

ago replaced lunch room bulletin board postings as

58 Such comments appear to misunderstand that
by this rule, the Board is indeed seeking to inform
employees of the provisions of the NLRA, using the
most accessible venues to reach them, their
workplaces.
Other comments question why this rule does not
mandate notice posting by governmental employers.
The NLRA does not cover such employers. See
Section 2(2), 29 U.S.C. 152(2).

its public information efforts. 59 One
comment urges the Board to conduct a
study to ascertain current employees’
level of NLRA knowledge before
imposing a notice posting requirement.
In contrast, as discussed in more
detail below, numerous comments from
individuals, union organizers, attorneys
representing unions, and worker
assistance organizations agree with the
Board that most employees are
unfamiliar with their NLRA rights.
Immigrant rights organizations state that
immigrant workers largely do not know
about their rights.
After careful consideration of the
comments on both sides of this issue,
the Board believes that many employees
are unaware of their NLRA rights and
that a notice posting requirement is a
reasonable means of promoting greater
knowledge among employees. To the
extent that employees’ general level of
knowledge is uncertain, the Board
believes that the potential benefit of a
notice posting requirement outweighs
the modest cost to employers. Certainly,
the Board has been presented with no
evidence persuasively demonstrating
that knowledge of NLRA rights is
widespread among employees.
The comments asserting that the right
to join a union is widely known cite
little, if any, support for that assertion.
By contrast, many of the comments
contending that employees are
unfamiliar with their NLRA rights base
their statements on personal experience
or on extensive experience representing
or otherwise assisting employees. Many
individual workers, commenting on the
rule, indicate their personal experiences
with the lack of NLRA knowledge and
concurrent strong support for the rule.
For example:
—Even though most of my coworkers and
supervisors were highly intelligent people,
it is my experience that most workers are
almost totally unaware of their rights under
the NLRA.
—Knowing that there is a federal agency out
there that will protect the rights of working
people to organize is essential to the
exercise of those rights.
—I had no idea that I had the right to join
a union, and was often told by my
employer that I could not do so. * * * I
think employers should be required to post
notices so that all employees may make an
informed decision about their rights to join
a union. 60
—Workers have rights and they have the
right to know them. 61
—[T]here is a lot of ignorance among young
workers and veteran workers alike with
regard to knowledge of their right to

organize. This is not a cure for employer
intimidation, * * * but it is a step in the
right direction.
—As an employee at will, I was not aware
of my rights to form a union or any rights
that I may have had under the NLRA. 62
—I worked in the construction materials
testing industry for about eight years.
During that time I had no idea I had the
right to join a union. 63
—As a working class citizen, I am well aware
of just how rare it is for my fellow workers
to know their rights. For that reason, this
is a rule that is extremely overdue. * * *.
A sampling of comments from labor
attorneys, workers’ organizations, and
labor organizations is consistent with
these employees’ comments:
—It is my experience that upwards of 95%
of employees have no idea what their
rights are with respect to labor unions. 64
—In fact, I have had many employees over
the years tell me that their employers have
told them that they do not allow unions at
their workplace. 65
—Workers today do not know what their
rights are under the NLRA. As a Union
organizer with more than 20 years of
experience, without exception, every
worker I encounter thinks that it is
perfectly legal for their employer to fire
them simply for saying the word union, or
even to speak with other employees at
work about general working conditions.
The protections afforded workers to engage
in protected concerted activity around
workplace issues is unknown to the
majority of workers today. 66
—It is the experience of [Service Employees
International Union (SEIU) Local 615] that
many employees are woefully unaware of
their rights under the NLRA and that that
lack of knowledge makes employees
vulnerable when they desire to address
their wages and working conditions with
the employers. 67
—I have participated in hundreds of
organizing campaigns involving thousands
of employees. In my experience, most
people had no idea what their rights were
to organize or join unions. 68
Some unions also assert that even
unionized employees often do not have
a clear understanding of the NLRA. One
union staff representative writes that
‘‘there seems to be a disconnect, most of
our membership does not know a thing
about NLRA.’’ 69 Another union steward
comments similarly:
I saw how union members were often
unaware of their rights unless the union

Notice to employees, however, could
provide a starting point for those employees
to try to assert rights that they currently have
on paper but often do not have in practice.
Several immigrant workers’
organizations comment on the difficulty
that this population has in
understanding their rights and accessing
the proper help when needed. 70 These
organizations note that laws in the
immigrants’ home countries may be
quite different from those of the United
States, and the high barrier that lack of
fluency in English creates in making
these persons aware of their rights
under the NLRA. 71 These organizations
also contend that because guestworkers
in particular can work only for the
employer that requested their visa, they
are extremely vulnerable to labor
violations, and that these employers
routinely misrepresent the existence of
NLRA rights. 72 The National Day
Laborers Organizing Network claims
that ‘‘most workers are not aware of
their right to organize.’’
One immigrant construction worker,
commenting favorably on the proposed
rule, explains that she learned English
after coming to the United States from
Poland: ‘‘While working as a testing
technician, I had no idea I had the right
to join a union.’’ She writes:
I think a government written notice posted
in the workplace would be a critical source
of information for employees who want to
join a union. Especially in this industry
where many people like myself are foreign
born, there is a language barrier that adds to
the difficulty in understanding our legal
rights. I take government posted notices
seriously and believe other people do as
well. 73
Significantly, the Board received
numerous comments opposing the rule
precisely because the commenters
believe that the notice will increase the
level of knowledge about the NLRA on
the part of employees. Specifically, they
predict that the rule will lead to
increased unionization and create
alleged adverse effects on employers
and the economy generally. For
example, Baker and Daniels LLP
comments that as more employees
become aware of their NLRA rights, they

charges and elect unions to serve as
their collective-bargaining
representatives. But fear that employees
may exercise their statutory rights is not
a valid reason for not informing them of
their rights.
Moreover, the NLRA protects the right
to join a union and to refrain from doing
so and the notice so states. In addition,
the NLRA confers and protects other
rights besides the right to join or refrain
from joining unions. Section 7 provides
that employees have the right ‘‘to engage
in other concerted activities for the
purpose of collective bargaining or other
mutual aid or protection[.]’’ Such
protected concerted activities include
concertedly complaining or petitioning
to management concerning their terms
and conditions of employment; 74
concertedly petitioning government
concerning matters of mutual interest in
the workplace; 75 and concertedly
refusing to work under poor working
conditions. 76 Few if any of the
comments contending that employees
know about their NLRA rights assert
that employees are aware of the right to
engage in such protected concerted
activities in the nonunion setting. By
contrast, as shown above, many
comments favoring the rule report that
nonunion employees are especially
unlikely to be aware of their NLRA
rights.
Although some comments contend
that the articles cited by the Board in
support of its belief that employees are
largely unaware of the NLRA rights are
old and inadequately supported, 77 they
cite no more recent or better supported
studies to the contrary. In addition, the
percentage of the private sector
workforce represented by unions has
declined from about 12 percent in 1989,
about the time the articles cited in the
NPRM were published, to 8 percent
presently; 78 thus, to the extent that lack
of contact with unions contributed to
lack of knowledge of NLRA rights 20
years ago, it probably is even more of a
factor today. 79

In support of their contention that
NLRA rights are widely known among
employees, several comments observe
that the Board’s processes for holding
representation elections and
investigating and remedying unfair
labor practices are invoked tens of
thousands of time a year. 80 That is true.
However, the civilian work force
includes some 108 million workers
potentially subject to the NLRA. 81 Thus,
the number of employees who invoke
the Board’s processes make up only a
small percentage of the covered
workforce. Accordingly, the Board does
not consider the number of times the
Board’s processes are invoked to be
persuasive evidence that workers
generally are aware of their NLRA
rights.
Finally, remarks in multiple opposing
comments strongly suggest that the
commenters themselves do not
understand the basic provisions of the
NLRA:
—If my employees want to join a union they
need to look for a job in a union
company. 82
—[a]nytime one of our independent
tradesmen would like to join the union
they are free to apply and be hired by a
union contractor.
—If a person so desires to be employed by
a union company, they should take their
ass to a union company and apply for a
union job.
—Belonging to a union is a privilege and a
preference—not a right. 83
—If they don’t like the way I treat them, then
go get another job. That is what capitalism
is about. 84

dissertation, ‘‘Seeds of Resurgence: Successful
Union Strategies for Winning Certification Elections

higher win rates for unions in elections involving
both immigrant and older workers argued against
the need for the proposed rule.
The Board is not addressing the many debated
causes of the declining rates of private sector
unionization in the United States. This rule simply
accepts those rates as given, and seeks to increase
the knowledge of NLRA provisions among those
without readily available sources of reliable
information on these provisions.

or she is free to apply to those companies
that operate with that form of
relationship. 86
—I also believe employees already have such
notice by understanding they retain the
right to change employers whenever they
so choose. 87
These comments reinforce the Board’s
belief that, in addition to informing
employees of their NLRA rights so that
they may better exercise those rights,
posting the notice may have the
beneficial side effect of informing
employers concerning the NLRA’s
requirements. 88
As to the contention that information
concerning unions is widely available
on the internet, including on the Board’s
Web site, the Board responds that not all
employees have ready access to the
internet. Moreover, it is reasonable to
assume that an employee who has no
idea that he or she has a right to join a
union, attempt to organize his
employer’s workforce, or engage in
other protected concerted activities,
would be less likely to seek such
information than one who is aware of
such rights and wants to learn more
about them. 89 The Board is pleased that
it has received a large number of
inquiries at its Web site seeking
information concerning NLRA rights,
but it is under no illusion that that
information will reach more than a
small fraction of the workforce in the
foreseeable future.
Several comments assert that, in any
event, requiring the posting of notices

88 And as one union official writes:
Having been active in labor relations for 30 years
I can assure you that both employees and employers
are confused about their respective rights under the
NLRA. Even union officers often do not understand
their rights. Members and non-members rarely
understand their rights. Often labor management
disputes arise because one or both sides are misinformed
about their rights. Often the employer
takes an action it truly believes is within its rights
when it is not.
Comment of Civil Service Employees Association.
89 Thus, the many comments that assert that
employees can just use Internet search engines to
find out about unions (see, e.g., comments of
Winseda Corp. Homestead Village, Inc.),
misapprehend the breadth of the rights of which the
Board seeks to apprise all employees. As stated
above, Section 7 is not merely about the right to join
or refrain from joining a labor organization, but
more broadly protects the right of employees to
engage in ‘‘concerted activities’’ for the purpose of
‘‘mutual aid or protection.’’ It is this right that is
the most misunderstood and simply not subject to
an easy Internet search by employees who may have
no idea of what terms to use, or even that such a
right might be protected at all.

will not be effective in informing
employees of their rights, because
employees will simply ignore the
notices, as the comments contend they
ignore other workplace postings.
‘‘Posters are an ineffective means of
educating workers and are rarely read
by employees.’’ 90 Other comments
argue that adding one more notice to the
many that are already mandated under
other statutes will simply create more
‘‘visual clutter’’ that contributes to
employees’ disinclination to pay
attention to posted notices. As one
employer stated, ‘‘My bulletin boards
are filled with required notifications
that nobody reads. In the past 15 years,
not one of our 200 employees has ever
asked about any of these required
postings. I have never seen anyone ever
read one of them.’’ 91 Another wrote,
‘‘Employers are already required to post
so many notices that these notices have
lost any semblance of effectiveness as a
governmental communication channel.’’
To these comments, the Board
responds that the experiences of the
commenters is apparently not universal;
other comments cited above contend
that employees are more knowledgeable
about their rights under statutes
requiring the posting of notices
summarizing those rights than about
their NLRA rights. Moreover, not every
employee has to read workplace notices
for those notices to be effective. If only
one employee of a particular employer
reads the Board’s notice and conveys
what he or she has read to the other
employees, that may be enough to pique
their interest in learning more about
their NLRA rights. In addition, the
Board is mandating electronic notice to
employees on an internet or intranet
site, when the employer customarily
communicates with its employees about
personnel rules or policies in that way,
in order to reach those who read paper
notices and those who read electronic
postings. As for the comment that
argues that the Board can use public
service announcements or advertising to
reach employees, the Board believes
that it makes much more sense to seek
to reach directly the persons to whom
the Act applies, in the location where
they are most likely to hear about their
other employment rights, the
workplace. 92

Some comments argue that the
Board’s notice posting rule does not go
far enough to effectuate the NLRA. One
labor attorney argues that the Board
should require annual trainings for
supervisors and captive audience
meetings where employees are read
their rights by supervisors and Board
agents and the employees would have to
acknowledge receiving those notices. 93
The same comment suggests banning
captive audience meetings by
employers. The comment concludes that
the NPRM ‘‘doesn’t go anywhere near
far enough. It is, however, an important
and worthwhile advancement.’’ 94
Another comment also suggests that
annual, mandatory training classes for
employees would be desirable. 95 The
Board believes that this Rule strikes the
proper balance in communicating
necessary information about the NLRA
to employees.
For all the foregoing reasons, the
Board is persuaded that many private
sector employees are unaware of their
NLRA rights. 96
III. Summary of Final Rule and
Discussion of Related Comments
The Board’s rule, which requires
employers subject to the NLRA to post
notices of employee rights under the
NLRA, will be set forth in Chapter 1,
Part 104 of Volume 29 of the Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR). Subpart A of
the rule sets out definitions; prescribes
the size, form, and content of the
employee notice; and lists the categories
of employers that are not covered by the
rule. Subpart B sets out standards and
a few months, especially since the number of
contractors covered by the Labor Department’s rule
is only a small fraction of the number of employers
subject to the NLRA. In any event, the Board does
not believe that that is the proper criterion by
which to measure the rule’s effectiveness. The
purpose of requiring the posting of such notices is
to inform employees of their rights so that they may
exercise them more effectively, not to obtain any
particular result such as the filing of more election
petitions.
The same comment also cites a couple of
textbooks which it asserts are popularly used in
high schools today to argue that labor history is
being taught to today’s students. The Board is
unable to assess the truth of that assertion, but
regardless, it is unclear whether students
necessarily connect this history to their future
rights as employees.
93 Comment of Weinberg, Roger & Rosenfeld.
94 Id.
95 Comment of Staff Representative, Steelworkers.
96 Accordingly, the Board finds it unnecessary to
conduct a study to determine the extent of
employees’ knowledge of NLRA rights. The Board
further observes that even if only 10 percent of
workers were unaware of those rights, that would
still mean that more than 10 million workers lacked
knowledge of one of their most basic workplace
rights. The Board believes that there is no question
that at least a similar percentage of employees are
unaware of the rights explained in the notice. In the
Board’s view, that justifies issuing the rule.
procedures related to allegations of
noncompliance and enforcement of the
rule. The discussion below is organized
in the same manner and explains the
Board’s reasoning in adopting the
standards and procedures contained in
the regulatory text, including the
Board’s responses to the comments
received.
Subpart A—Definitions, Requirements
for Employee Notice, and Exceptions
From Coverage Definitions
A. The Definitions
For the most part, the definitions
proposed in the rule are taken from
those appearing in Section 2 of the
NLRA, 29 U.S.C. 152. No comments
were received concerning those
definitions, and they are unchanged in
the final rule. A number of comments
were received concerning the definition
of other terms appearing in the rule.
Those comments are addressed below.
B. Requirements for Employee Notice
1. Content Requirements
The notice contains a summary of
employee rights established under the
NLRA. As explained above, the Board
believes that requiring notice of
employee rights is necessary to carry out
the provisions of the NLRA.
Accordingly, § 104.202 of the proposed
rule requires employers subject to the
NLRA to post and maintain the notice
in conspicuous places, including all
places where notices to employees are
customarily posted, and to take
reasonable steps to ensure that the
notices are not altered, defaced, or
covered by any other material, or
otherwise rendered unreadable.
As stated in the NPRM, the Board
considered the substantive content and
level of detail the notice should contain
regarding NLRA rights. In arriving at the
content of the notice of employee rights,
the Board proposed to adopt the
language of the Department of Labor’s
final rule requiring Federal contractors
to post notices of employees’ NLRA
rights. 29 CFR part 471. In the NPRM,
the Board explained that it tentatively
agreed with the Department of Labor
that neither quoting the statement of
employee rights contained in Section 7
of the NLRA nor briefly summarizing
those rights in the notice would be
likely to effectively inform employees of
their rights. Rather, the language of the
notice should include a more detailed
description of employee rights derived
from Board and court decisions
implementing those rights. The Board
also stated that it saw merit in the
Department of Labor’s judgment that
including in the notice examples, again
VerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00014 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2
derived from Board and court decisions,
of conduct that violates the NLRA will
assist employees in understanding their
rights. 75 FR 80412.
Prior to issuing the NPRM, the Board
carefully reviewed the content of the
notice required under the Department of
Labor’s final rule, which was modified
in response to comments from
numerous sources, and tentatively
concluded that that notice explains
employee rights accurately and
effectively without going into excessive
or confusing detail. The Board therefore
found it unnecessary, for purposes of
the proposed rulemaking, to modify the
language of the notice in the Department
of Labor’s final rule. Moreover, the
Board reasoned that because the notice
of employee rights would be the same
under the Board’s proposed rule as
under the Department of Labor’s rule,
Federal contractors that have posted the
Department of Labor’s required notice
would have complied with the Board’s
rule and, so long as that notice is
posted, would not have to post a second
notice. Id.
The proposed notice contained
examples of general circumstances that
constitute violations of employee rights
under the NLRA. Thus, the Board
proposed a notice that provided
employees with more than a
rudimentary overview of their rights
under the NLRA, in a user-friendly
format, while simultaneously not
overwhelming employees with
information that is unnecessary and
distracting in the limited format of a
notice. As explained below, the Board
also tentatively agreed with the
Department of Labor that it is
unnecessary for the notice to include
specifically the right of employees who
are not union members and who are
covered by a contractual union-security
clause to refuse to pay union dues and
fees for any purpose other than
collective bargaining, contract
administration, or grievance adjustment.
See Communications Workers v. Beck,
487 U.S. 735 (1988). Id. at 80412–80413.
The Board specifically invited
comment on the statement of employee
rights proposed for inclusion in the
required notice to employees. In
particular, the Board requested
comment on whether the notice
contains sufficient information of
employee rights under the NLRA;
whether it effectively conveys that
information to employees; and whether
it achieves the desired balance between
providing an overview of employee
rights under the Act and limiting
unnecessary and distracting
information. Id. at 80413.

The proposed Appendix to Subpart A
included Board contact information and
basic enforcement procedures to enable
employees to learn more about their
NLRA rights and how to enforce them.
Thus, the required notice confirmed that
unlawful conduct will not be permitted,
provided information about the Board
and about filing a charge with the
Board, and stated that the Board will
prosecute violators of the NLRA. The
notice also indicated that there is a 6-
month statute of limitations for filing
charges with the Board alleging
violations and provided Board contact
information. The Board invited
suggested additions or deletions to these
provisions that would improve the
content of the notice of employee rights.
Id.
The content of the proposed notice
received more comments than any other
single topic in the proposed rule. But of
the thousands of comments that address
the content of the notice, the majority
are either very general, or identical or
nearly identical form letters or
‘‘postcard’’ comments sent in response
to comment initiatives by various
interest groups, including those
representing employers, unions, and
employee rights organizations. Many
comments from both individuals and
organizations offer general support for
the content of the proposed notice,
stating that employee awareness of basic
legal rights will promote a fair and just
workplace, improve employee morale,
and foster workforce stability, among
other benefits. 97 More specifically, one
comment asserts that the proposed
notice ‘‘contains an accurate,
understandable and balanced
presentation of rights.’’ 98 The United
Transportation Union contends that the
‘‘notice presents an understandable,
concise and extremely informative
recitation of workers’ rights, without
getting bogged down in extraneous
language, incomprehensible legalese or
innumerable caveats and exceptions.’’
Other comments were less supportive
of the content of the proposed notice
and the notice-posting requirement in
general. A significant number of
comments, including those from many
individuals, employers, and employer
industry and interest groups, argue that
the content of the notice is not balanced,
and appears to promote unionization
instead of employee freedom of
association. In particular, many
comments state that Section 7 of the
97 See comments of the National Immigration Law
Center, Service Employees International Union, and
Weinberg, Roger & Rosenfeld.
98 Comment of David Fusco, a labor and
employment attorney.
NLRA includes the right to refrain from
union activity, but claim that this right
is given little attention in comparison to
other rights in the proposed notice.
Several comments also argue that the
proposed notice excludes rights
associated with an anti-union position,
including the right to seek
decertification of a bargaining
representative, the right to abstain from
union membership in ‘‘right-to-work’’
states, and rights associated with the
Supreme Court’s decision in
Communications Workers v. Beck. 99
Comments also suggest that the notice
should include a warning to employees
that unionizing will result in a loss of
the right to negotiate directly with their
employer. 100 Many of these comments
argue that a neutral government position
on unionization would be more
inclusive of anti-union rights. 101
A number of comments address the
issue of complexity, and argue that the
Board’s attempt to summarize the law is
flawed because the Board’s decisional
law is too complex to condense into a
single workplace notice. 102 Some of the
comments addressing this issue note
that NLRA law has been developed over
75 years, and involves interpretations by
both the NLRB and the Federal courts,
sometimes with conflicting results. The
Chamber of Commerce cites the
‘‘NLRB’s Basic Guide to the National
Labor Relations Act: General Principles
of Law Under the Statute and
Procedures of the National Labor
Relations Board’’ (Basic Guide to the
NLRA) (1997), available at http://
www.nlrb.gov/publications/brochures,
to make their point about legal
complexity. In the Foreword to the
Basic Guide to the NLRA, the Board’s
General Counsel states that ‘‘[a]ny effort
to state basic principles of law in a
simple way is a challenging and
unenviable task. This is especially true
about labor law, a relatively complex
field of law.’’ The thrust of these
comments about legal complexity was
that the NLRA is complex, dynamic,
and nuanced, and any attempt to
summarize it in a workplace notice will
result in an oversimplification of the
law and lead to confusion,
misunderstanding, inconsistencies, and
some say, heightened labor-management
antagonism. Moreover, some comments
express concern that Board member
turnover could result in changes to the

law, which may require frequent
updates to the notice. 103
Many comments suggest that the
required notice should include only the
specific rights contained in Section 7 of
the NLRA or, at most, the rights and
obligations stated in employee
advisories on the NLRB’s Web site. The
comments favoring a more general
notice suggest that the detailed list of
rights far exceeds the ‘‘short and plain’’
description of rights that the Board has
found sufficient to ‘‘clearly and
effectively inform employees of their
rights under the Act’’ in unfair labor
practice cases. 104 See Ishikawa Gasket
America, Inc., 337 NLRB 175 (2001),
enfd. 354 F.3d 534 (6th Cir. 2004). A
comment from Fisher & Phillips LLP
argues that, under the Board’s current
remedial practices, only an employer
that egregiously violates the Act on
numerous occasions is required to post
such an inclusive list of rights.
Finally, a number of comments
suggest that the notice should include a
list of employer rights, namely the right
to distribute anti-union literature and
the right to discuss the company’s
position regarding unions.
In addition to the general comments
about the proposed notice, many
comments offer suggestions for specific
revisions to individual provisions
within the five sections of the proposed
notice: the introduction, the statement
of affirmative rights, the examples of
unlawful conduct, the collectivebargaining
provision, and the coverage
information. The following discussion
presents the comments related to
individual provisions of the notice,
followed by the Board’s decisions
regarding the content of the final notice
made in response to those comments.
a. Comments Regarding the Introduction
The introduction to the notice of
rights in the proposed rule stated:
The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)
guarantees the right of employees to organize
and bargain collectively with their
employers, and to engage in other protected
concerted activity. Employees covered by the
NLRB are protected from certain types of
employer and union misconduct. This Notice
gives you general information about your
rights, and about the obligations of employers
under the NLRA. Contact the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB), the Federal agency
that investigates and resolves complaints
under the NLRA, using the contact
information supplied below, if you have any
questions about specific rights that may
apply in your particular workplace.
103 See comment of Capital Associated Industries,
Inc. and National Association of Manufacturers.
104 See e.g. comments of COLLE and Coalition for
a Democratic Workplace.

mstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2
75 FR 80418–80419 (footnote omitted).
The Board received a few suggestions
for changes to the introduction of the
notice. The first comment suggests
including language stating that
employees are required to contact their
‘‘executive manager’’ or ‘‘administrative
team’’ before contacting the NLRB and
suggests that the NLRB refuse to process
employees’ complaints until the
employees first raise the issue with his
or her ‘‘management team.’’ The second
comment, from COLLE, urges the Board
to add language in the introduction
alerting employees that they also have
the right to refrain from engaging in
union activity. The comment suggests
that by not including the right to refrain
from union activity in the introduction,
the Board is showing a bias toward
union organizing. The comment argues
that a more neutral notice would
include both the right to engage and not
engage in union activity at the
beginning of the document, rather than
wait to first mention the right to refrain
in the affirmative rights section.
The Board does not agree with the
proposal that employees be required to
contact management officials as a
prerequisite to contacting the Board.
Such a procedural requirement is not
contemplated in the NLRA and could
discourage employees from exercising
or vindicating their rights.
The Board agrees, however, that the
introduction should include both the
rights to engage in union and other
concerted activity and the right to
refrain from doing so. The Board
believes that adding the right to refrain
to the introduction will aid in the
Board’s approach to present a balanced
and neutral statement of rights.
Accordingly, the first sentence in the
introduction to the notice in the final
rule will state:
The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)
guarantees the right of employees to organize
and bargain collectively with their
employers, and to engage in other protected
concerted activity or to refrain from engaging
in any of the above activity.
b. Comments Regarding Affirmative
Statement of Rights
The proposed notice contains the
following statement of affirmative
rights: Under the NLRA, you have the
right to:
Organize a union to negotiate with your
employer concerning your wages, hours, and
other terms and conditions of employment.
Form, join or assist a union.
Bargain collectively through
representatives of employees’ own choosing
for a contract with your employer setting
your wages, benefits, hours, and other
working conditions.
Discuss your terms and conditions of
employment or union organizing with your
co-workers or a union.
Take action with one or more co-workers
to improve your working conditions by,
among other means, raising work-related
complaints directly with your employer or
with a government agency, and seeking help
from a union.
Strike and picket, depending on the
purpose or means of the strike or the
picketing.
Choose not to do any of these activities,
including joining or remaining a member of
a union.
75 FR 80419.
The majority of comments addressing
the affirmative rights section were
general and did not specifically address
the language of the individual
provisions. Generally, labor
organizations and employee advocate
groups favor the Board’s language. A
comment from the United Food and
Commercial Workers International
Union asserts that the approach
‘‘achieves an appropriate balance
between providing sufficiently clear
information about employee’s basic
statutory rights and limiting
unnecessary and confusing information
about peripheral rights.’’ On the other
hand, comments from employer groups
do not favor the Board’s language. More
specifically, employer groups argue that
the notice is biased toward union
organizing. Generally, the comments
argue that the right to refrain from
engaging in union activity should have
a more prominent place on the notice,
rather than being the last of the rights
listed on the poster. Many of these
comments contend that the notice
should include the right not to engage
in specific union-related activities.
Other comments about the notice’s
statement of affirmative rights are
directed at individual provisions of the
notice. A discussion of those comments
is set out in more detail below.
i. The Right To Organize and the Right
To Form, Join and Assist a Union
A few comments generally state that
the notice should include the
consequences of exercising the right to
organize, join or form a union. 105 For
example, several comments argue that
employees should be informed that if
they join a union they give up the right
to deal directly with their employers.
Another comment argues that
employees should be informed of the
cost of organizing a union, including the
cost of dues and the potential for the
company to shut down because of
increased labor costs associated with a
unionized workforce. Other comments
105 See, e.g., comment of Pilchak Cohen & Tice.
VerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00016 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2
suggest including language informing
employees that they can be fired for not
paying their union dues.
The Board rejects those suggestions.
The notice is intended to inform
employees of the rights that they have
under the NLRA and does not include
the benefits or consequences of
exercising any of the enumerated rights.
Adding the consequences of one right
would require revising the entire notice
to include potential consequences—
both positive and negative—of all the
protected rights. For example, the notice
would need to include the
consequences of refraining from joining
a union, such as not being permitted to
vote on contract ratifications or attend
union membership meetings. The
necessary additions to the notice would
create a notice that is not a concise list
of rights, but more likely a pamphletsized
list of rights and explanations. In
addition, the consequences of
unionization are unique to each
unionized workplace, so it would be
impossible to include a list of general
consequences that could apply
uniformly to all unionized workplaces.
If employees have questions about the
implications of any of their rights, they
can contact an NLRB regional office.
Assisted Living Federation of America
(ALFA) suggests that the affirmative
rights section should be revised to
reflect the anti-union position. For
example, rather than the current
provision that states that employees
have a right to ‘‘[o]rganize a union to
negotiate with your employer
concerning your wages, hours, and other
terms and conditions of employment,’’
the comment suggests the following
provision: ‘‘you have the right to
organize with other employees in
opposition to a particular union or
unions.’’ And ‘‘you have the right to:
refuse to form, join, or assist a union,
including the right to refuse to sign a
union card, attend a union meeting or
supply a union with information
concerning you, your co-worker or your
job,’’ rather than ‘‘[you have the right to]
[f]orm, join or assist a union.’’ The
Board disagrees. The Board’s proposed
notice language reflects the language of
the NLRA itself, which specifically
grants affirmative rights, including
nearly all of those listed in the notice.
Also, the notice, like the NLRA, states
that employees have the right to refrain
from engaging in all of the listed
activities. The Board therefore sees no
need to recast the notice to further
emphasize the right to oppose unions.
ii. The Right To Bargain Collectively
Two comments suggest that the
collective-bargaining provision is
Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations
54021
mstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2
misleading and vague. The first
comment, from COLLE, argues that the
provision is misleading because it fails
to acknowledge that an employer does
not have an obligation under the NLRA
to consent to the establishment of a
collective-bargaining agreement, but
instead only has the statutory duty to
‘‘meet at reasonable times and confer in
good faith with respect to wages, hours,
and other terms and conditions of
employment.’’ 29 U.S.C. 158(d). The
comment also argues that the failure to
reach an agreement is not per se
unlawful, and the finding of an unfair
labor practice depends on whether the
parties engaged in good-faith bargaining.
This comment suggests that the notice
should instead note that the NLRA
requires parties to bargain in good faith
but does not compel agreement or the
making of concessions, and that, in
some instances, a bargaining impasse
will result, permitting the parties to
exercise their economic weapons, such
as strikes or lockouts. The second
comment, made generally by more than
a few organizations and individuals,
suggests that the notice add a statement
indicating that employers and unions
have an obligation to bargain in good
faith.
The Board finds it unnecessary to add
the suggested amplifications. For one
thing, the notice does state that
employers and unions have a duty to
bargain in good faith, ‘‘in a genuine
effort to reach a written, binding
agreement setting your terms and
conditions of employment.’’ In the
Board’s view, the statement that the
parties must make a ‘‘genuine effort’’ to
reach agreement necessarily implies that
they are not, in the end, required to
reach one. The Board deems the notice
language to be adequate on this point.
Finally, for the reasons already
discussed, the Board rejects the
contention that the notice should
discuss the implications or
consequences of unsuccessful
bargaining.
iii. The Right To Discuss With Co-
Workers or Union
A comment from the National
Immigration Law Center suggests that
the use of the phrase ‘‘terms and
conditions of employment’’ is unclear
especially to employees who are
unaware of their rights under the NLRA.
The comment recommends that, in
order to clarify, the Board add the
phrase ‘‘including wages and benefits.’’
The suggested language would read,
‘‘you have the right to: discuss your
terms and conditions of employment,
including wages and benefits, or union
organizing with your co-workers or a
union.’’
The Board agrees that adding the
suggested language would clarify the
provision. The list of affirmative rights
uses the terms ‘‘wages, hours, and other
terms and conditions of employment’’ to
describe what unions may negotiate.
The notice then uses the terms ‘‘wages,
benefits, hours, and other working
conditions’’ to describe the right to
bargain collectively for a contract. Those
statements make it clear that ‘‘terms and
conditions of employment’’ includes
wages and benefits. But then
immediately following those two
statements, the notice states that
employees may discuss ‘‘terms and
conditions of employment,’’ but does
not include any clarifying language. In
order, to create a more uniform notice
and clarify the extent to which
employees may discuss their terms and
conditions of employment the final
notice will read, ‘‘Under the NLRA, you
have a right to: Discuss your wages and
benefits and other terms and conditions
of employment or union organizing with
your co-workers or a union.’’
iv. The Right To Strike and Picket
The notice’s reference to the right to
strike and picket received a few
comments from law firms and other
organizations representing employers’
interests. The comments suggest that the
provision is flawed because of the
absence of further limitations,
exceptions, and distinctions. 106
Generally, the comments argue that not
all strikes and pickets are protected.
COLLE argues that the notice should
inform employees of the limitations of
strikes encompassed by ‘‘depending on
the purpose or means of the strike or
pickets’’—for example, whether the
strike is for recognition or bargaining,
whether the strike has a secondary
purpose, whether picketing involves a
reserved gate, whether the strike is a sitdown
or minority strike, whether the
conduct is a slowdown and not a full
withholding of work, whether the strike
is partial or intermittent, whether the
strike involves violence, and whether
the strike is an unfair labor practice
strike or an economic strike. ALFA
argues that employees should be
informed that if the employer is a
healthcare institution, ‘‘employees do
not have the right to participate in a
union-initiated strike or picket unless
the union has provided the employer
and federal and state mediation agencies
with the required 10 days notice.’’
106 See comments of ALFA, Carrollton Health and
Rehabilitation Center, and COLLE.
VerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00017 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2
The Board disagrees. By necessity, an
11x17-inch notice cannot contain an
exhaustive list of limitations on and
exceptions to the rights to strike and
picket, as suggested by employers.
However, because exercising the right to
strike can significantly affect the
livelihood of employees, the Board
considers it important to alert
employees that there are some
limitations to exercising this right. The
Board is satisfied that the general
caveat, ‘‘depending on the purpose or
means of the strike or the picketing,’’
together with the instruction to contact
the NLRB with specific questions about
the application of rights in certain
situations, provides sufficient guidance
to employees about the exercise of their
rights while still staying within the
constraints set by a necessarily brief
employee notice.
v. The Right To Refrain From Union or
Other Protected Concerted Activity
All the comments that discuss the
right to refrain from engaging in union
activity criticize what they contend to
be its lack of prominence. ALFA accuses
the Board of ‘‘burying’’ the provision by
placing it last, below the other rights to
engage in union and other concerted
activity. The U.S. Chamber of
Commerce suggests that the notice
include ‘‘or not’’ after each of the
enumerated rights. For example, ‘‘you
have the right to: form join or assist a
union, or not.’’ (Emphasis added.) Other
suggested revisions to amplify the
prominence of the provision include
stating that employees have the right to
refrain from protected, concerted
activities and/or union activities; stating
that employees’ right to refrain includes
the right to actively oppose
unionization, to not sign union
authorization cards, to request a secret
ballot election, to not be a member of a
union or pay dues or fees (addressed
further below), or to decertify a union
(also addressed below); and stating that
employees have the right to be fairly
represented even if not a member of the
union. One employer suggests that if the
notice retains its current emphasis
favoring union activity and disfavoring
the freedom to refrain from such
activity, employers will need to post
their own notices that emphasize and
elaborate on the right to refrain.
The Board received at least four
comments that argue that the notice, as
written, may make employees believe
that the employer is encouraging
unionization. Two of those comments
suggest that an employer is protected
from compelled speech by Section 8(c)
of the NLRA. (The Board has already
rejected the latter argument; see section
54022 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations
mstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2
II, subsection B, ‘‘Statutory Authority,’’
above.)
The contention that the right to
refrain from engaging in union activity
is ‘‘buried’’ in the list of other
affirmative rights or that the Board is
biased in favor of unionization because
of the choice of placement is without
merit. The list of rights in the proposed
notice is patterned after the list of rights
in Section 7 of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. 157.
Section 7 lists the right to refrain last,
after stating several other affirmative
rights before it. In addition, the Board’s
remedial notices list the right to refrain
last. See Ishikawa Gasket America, Inc.,
above. So does the Board’s Notice of
Election. In addition, the notice
required by this rule states that it is
illegal for an employer to take adverse
action against an employee ‘‘because
[the employee] choose[s] not to engage
in any such [union-related] activity.’’
The Board has revised the introduction
of the notice to include the right to
refrain—this addition further highlights
an employee’s right to refrain from
union activity. Finally, the Board
believes that people understand a right
as different from an obligation and thus
will, for example, understand that the
right to organize a union includes the
right not to do so. Accordingly, the
Board concludes that the notice
sufficiently addresses the right to refrain
among the list of statutory rights. In
addressing the numerous comments
questioning the Board’s neutrality, the
Board points out that in Section 1 of the
NLRA, Congress declared that it is the
policy of the United States to mitigate
or eliminate obstructions to the free
flow of commerce ‘‘by encouraging the
practice and procedure of collective
bargaining and by protecting the
exercise by workers of full freedom of
association, self-organization, and
designation of representatives of their
own choosing, for the purpose of
negotiating the terms and conditions of
their employment or other mutual aid or
protection.’’ 29 U.S.C. 151. Thus, by its
own terms, the NLRA encourages
collective bargaining and the exercise of
the other affirmative rights guaranteed
by the statute. In doing so, however, the
NLRA seeks to ensure employee choice
both to participate in union or other
protected concerted activity and to
refrain from doing so.
Turning to the issues of whether the
notice creates the impression that the
employer is encouraging unionization
and whether an employer can be
compelled to post the notice which
contains information the employer
would otherwise not share with
employees, the Board disagrees with
both arguments. First, the notice clearly
states that it is from the government.
Second, in light of the other workplace
notice employees are accustomed to
seeing, employees will understand that
the notice is a communication to
workers from the government, not from
the employer. Finally, as discussed
above, NLRA Section 8(c) protects
employers’ right to express any ‘‘views,
argument, or opinion’’ ‘‘if such
expression contains no threat of reprisal
or force or promise of benefit.’’ The rule
does not affect this right. Therefore, if
an employer is concerned that
employees will get the wrong
impression, it may legally express its
opinion regarding unionization as long
as it does so in a noncoercive manner.
Critics of the notice contend that the
notice should contain a number of
additional rights and also explanations
of when and how an employee may opt
out of paying union dues. Thus, most
employer groups argue that the notice
should contain a statement regarding
the right to decertify a union. A number
of those comments state that the notice
should provide detailed guidance on the
process for decertifying a union. Others
suggest that the notice should contain
instructions for deauthorizing a union
security clause. A majority of employers
and individuals who filed comments on
the content of the notice urge the Board
to include a notice of employee rights
under Communications Workers v.
Beck. Baker & McKenzie suggests
adding a provision informing employees
that for religious purposes an employee
may opt out of paying dues to a
union. 107 A few comments also suggest
that the notice add any rights that
employees may have in ‘‘right-to-work’’
states. As indicated previously,
numerous comments suggest the
inclusion of other rights of employees
who do not desire union representation.
Baker & McKenzie suggests a list of 26
additional affirmative rights, most of
which only affect employees in a
unionized setting and are derived from
the Labor-Management Reporting and
Disclosure Act, the Labor-Management
Relations Act, or other Federal labor
statutes enforced by the Department of
Labor. The proposed list also includes
107 NLRA Section 19 provides that ‘‘Any
employee who is a member of and adheres to
established and traditional tenets or teachings of a
bona fide religion, body, or sect which has
historically held conscientious objections to joining
or financially supporting labor organizations shall
not be required to join or financially support any
labor organization as a condition of employment;
except that such employee may be required in a
contract between such employee’s employer and a
labor organization in lieu of periodic dues and
initiation fees, to pay sums equal to such dues and
initiation fees to a nonreligious, nonlabor
organization charitable fund exempt from
taxation[.]’’ 29 U.S.C. 169.
VerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00018 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2
some rights covered by the NLRA such
as ‘‘the right to sign or refuse to sign an
authorization card,’’ ‘‘the right to
discuss the advantages and
disadvantages of union representation
or membership with the employer,’’ and
‘‘the right to receive information from
the employer regarding the advantages
and disadvantages of union
representation.’’
The Board has determined that the
inclusion of these additional items is
unnecessary. As discussed above, the
NLRA itself contains only a general
statement that employees have the right
not to participate in union and/or other
protected concerted activities. Section
19 does specifically set forth the right of
certain religious objectors to pay the
equivalent of union dues to a taxexempt
charity; however, this right is
implicated only when an employer and
union have entered into a unionsecurity
arrangement. Because the
notice does not mention or explain such
arrangements, the Board finds no reason
to list this narrow exception to unionsecurity
requirements. In sum, the
Board is not persuaded that the notice
needs to expand further on the right to
refrain by including a list of specific
ways in which employees can elect not
to participate or opt out of paying union
dues. Employees who desire more
information regarding the right not to
participate can contact the Board.
The Board does not believe that
further explication of this point is
necessary. However, because so many
comments argue that the notice should
include the right to decertify a union
and rights under Communication
Workers v. Beck, the Board has decided
to explain specifically why it disagrees
with each contention.
Concerning the right to decertify, the
notice states that employees have the
right not to engage in union activity,
‘‘including joining or remaining a
member of a union.’’ Moreover, the
notice does not mention the right to
seek Board certification of a union.
Indeed, contrary to the numerous
comments suggesting that the proposed
notice is a ‘‘roadmap’’ for union
organizing, the notice does not even
mention the right to petition for a union
representation election, possibly leading
to union certification; rather, it merely
states that employees have the right to
‘‘organize a union’’ and ‘‘form, join or
assist a union.’’ The notice does not give
any further instructions on how an
employee can exercise those rights.
Similarly, the notice states that
employees may choose not to remain a
member of a union without further
instructions on how to exercise that
right. To include instructions for
Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations
54023
mstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2
exercising one right and not the other
would upset the balanced recitation of
rights. If employees have questions
concerning how they can exercise their
rights, the notice encourages them to
contact the Board.
The Board has also determined that
the addition of Beck rights in the final
notice is unnecessary. Those rights
apply only to employees who are
represented by unions under collectivebargaining
agreements containing
union-security provisions. As stated in
the NPRM, unions that seek to obligate
employees to pay dues and fees under
those provisions are required to inform
those employees of their Beck rights.
See California Saw & Knife Works,
above, 320 NLRB at 233. See 75 FR at
80412–80413. The Board was presented
with no evidence during this
rulemaking that suggests that unions are
not generally complying with their
notice obligations. In addition, the
Notice of Election, which is posted days
before employees vote on whether to be
represented by a union, contains an
explanation of Beck rights. Moreover, as
the Board stated in the NPRM, only
about 8 percent of all private sector
employees are represented by unions,
and by no means are all of them subject
to union-security clauses. Accordingly,
the number of employees to whom Beck
applies is significantly smaller than the
number of employees in the private
sector covered by the NLRA. Id. at
80413. Indeed, in the ‘‘right-to-work’’
states, where union-security clauses are
prohibited, no employees are covered by
union security clauses, with the
possible exception of employees who
work in a Federal enclave where state
laws do not apply. Accordingly, because
Beck does not apply to the
overwhelming majority of employees in
today’s private sector workplace, and
because unions already are obliged to
inform the employees to whom it does
apply of their Beck rights, the Board is
not including Beck notification in the
final notice.
The Board also disagrees with the
comment from Baker & McKenzie
contending that an exhaustive list of
additional rights should be included in
the notice. In addition to the reasons
discussed above, the Board finds that it
would not be appropriate to include
those rights, most of which are rights of
union members vis-à-vis their unions.
For example, the comment suggests
including the ‘‘right for each union
member to insist that his/her dues and
initiation fees not be increased * * *
except by a majority vote by secret
ballot * * *,’’ the ‘‘right of each
employee in a bargaining unit to receive
a copy of the collective bargaining
agreement,’’ and the ‘‘right to nominate
candidates, to vote in elections of the
labor organization, to attend
membership meetings, and to
participate in the deliberations and
voting upon business properly before
the meeting.’’ Those rights are not found
in the NLRA, but instead arise from
other Federal labor laws not
administered by the NLRB. See Labor-
Management Reporting and Disclosure
Act of 1959, 29 U.S.C. 401 et seq
(LMRDA). The Board finds that it would
be inappropriate to include those
additional rights in a notice informing
employees of their rights under the
NLRA.
vi. Other Comments
The Board has also considered, but
rejected, the contention that the notice
contain simply a ‘‘short and plain’’
description of rights such as that used
in remedial notices. See Ishikawa
Gasket America, Inc., above. The two
notices have different purposes: one
looks back; the other, forward. As
explained in the NPRM, the principal
purpose of a remedial notice is to
inform employees of unlawful conduct
that has taken place and what is being
done to remedy that conduct.
Accordingly, although a remedial notice
contains only a brief summary of NLRA
rights, it also contains examples of
unlawful actions that have been
committed. To the extent that such a
notice generally increases employees’
awareness of their rights, the unlawful
conduct detailed adds to that awareness.
The proposed notice, by contrast, is a
notice intended to make employees
aware of their NLRA rights generally. It
normally will not be posted against a
background of already-committed unfair
labor practices; it therefore needs to
contain a summary both of NLRA rights
and examples of unlawful conduct in
order to inform employees effectively of
the extent of their NLRA rights and of
the availability of remedies for
violations of those rights. Moreover, as
the Board explained in the NPRM, the
general notice of rights posted in the
pre-election notice is sufficient because
at least one union along with the
employer is on the scene to enlighten
employees of their rights under the
NLRA. 75 FR 80412 fn.19.
The fundamental rights described in
the notice are well established and have
been unchanged for much of the Board’s
history. Accordingly, the Board does not
share the concern expressed in some
comments that a new notice will have
to be posted each time the composition
of the Board changes.
Finally, the Board rejects the
contention that the notice should
VerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2
address certain rights of employers. The
notice is intended to inform employees
of their rights, not those of their
employers.
For all the foregoing reasons, the
Board finds it unnecessary to modify the
section of the notice summarizing
employees’ NLRA rights.
c. The Examples of Unlawful Employer
Conduct in the Notice
The proposed notice contained the
following examples of unlawful
conduct:
Under the NLRA, it is illegal for your
employer to:
Prohibit you from soliciting for a union
during non-work time, such as before or after
work or during break times; or from
distributing union literature during non-work
time, in non-work areas, such as parking lots
or break rooms.
Question you about your union support or
activities in a manner that discourages you
from engaging in that activity.
Fire, demote, or transfer you, or reduce
your hours or change your shift, or otherwise
take adverse action against you, or threaten
to take any of these actions, because you join
or support a union, or because you engage in
concerted activity for mutual aid and
protection, or because you choose not to
engage in any such activity.
Threaten to close your workplace if
workers choose a union to represent them.
Promise or grant promotions, pay raises, or
other benefits to discourage or encourage
union support.
Prohibit you from wearing union hats,
buttons, t-shirts, and pins in the workplace
except under special circumstances.
Spy on or videotape peaceful union
activities and gatherings or pretend to do so.
75 FR 80419.
The Board received limited comments
on six of the seven examples of
unlawful employer conduct. As a
general matter, some comments contend
that the number of examples of
employer misconduct is
disproportionate compared to the
examples of union misconduct. 108 Most
of the comments refer to the number of
paragraphs devoted to illegal employer
conduct (7) and the number of
paragraphs devoted to illegal union
conduct (5). Several comments indicate
that when one compares the employer
misconduct listed in Section 8(a) of the
NLRA with union misconduct listed in
Section 8(b), no such imbalance appears
in the text of the statute. Several
comments provide additional examples
of union misconduct that they say
should be included.
As with the notice’s statement of
affirmative rights, some of the
108 See, e.g., comments of COLLE, Baker &
McKenzie, National Association of Manufacturers,
and American Trucking Association.
54024 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations
mstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2
individual provisions in this section of
the notice received numerous comments
and suggestions for improvement. The
vast majority of the comments about the
specific provisions are from
representatives of employers. Those
comments generally contend that the
provisions are overgeneralizations and
do not articulate the legal standard for
evaluating allegations of unlawful
conduct or indicate factual scenarios in
which certain employer conduct may be
lawful.
After reviewing all of the comments,
the Board has decided to revise one of
the examples of unlawful employer
conduct contained in the NPRM. The
Board concludes that the other
provisions, as proposed, are accurate
and informative and, as with the notice
as a whole, strike an appropriate
balance between being simultaneously
instructive and succinct.
Furthermore, the Board sees no reason
to add or subtract from the employer or
union illegal activity to make the two
sections contain an equal number of
paragraphs. The comment that argues
that no imbalance exists in the statute
is correct, but the majority of violations
under Section 8(b) concern union
conduct vis-à-vis employers, not
conduct that impairs employees’ rights.
The notice of rights is intended to
summarize employer and union
violations against employees;
accordingly, there is no need to alter the
list to include unlawful union activity
against employers.
i. No-Solicitation and No-Distribution
Rules
The Board received a few comments
that were critical of the proposed notice
language stating that an employer
cannot lawfully prohibit employees
from ‘‘soliciting for the union during
non-work time or distributing union
literature during non-work time, in nonwork
areas.’’ The Service Employees
International Union comments that
‘‘solicitation’’ has a narrow meaning and
involves asking someone to join the
union by signing an authorization card,
which is subject to the restrictions
suggested in the notice. The comment
submits that the notice should state that
an employer cannot prohibit employees
from ‘‘talking’’ about a union. The
comment suggests that ‘‘talking’’ is both
more accurate and is easier for
employees to understand than
‘‘soliciting.’’
The remaining comments criticize the
provision for failing to note any
limitations on employees’ rights to
solicit and distribute, such as the
limited rights of off-duty employees,
and limitations in retail and health care
establishments. One comment, in
particular, suggests the notice should
advise healthcare employees that they
do not enjoy a protected right to solicit
in immediate patient care areas or
where their activity might disturb
patients. See Beth Israel Hosp. v. NLRB,
437 U.S. 483 (1978). The comment
proposes to include a qualification that
a hospital or other health care employer
may prohibit all solicitation in
immediate patient care areas or outside
those areas when necessary to avoid
disrupting health care operations or
disturbing patients. Another comment
suggests that the law in this area is so
complex that no meaningful but
succinct provision can be constructed,
and therefore recommends deleting it
entirely.
The Board disagrees with those
comments. The Board appreciates that
under case law, employees’ right to
engage in solicitation and distribution of
literature is qualified in certain settings
and accordingly that employers may, in
some situations, legally prohibit
solicitation or distribution of literature
even during employees’ nonworking
time. Given the variety of circumstances
in which the right to solicit and
distribute may be limited, however, the
Board has determined that limitations
on the size and format of the notice
preclude the inclusion of factual
situations in which an employer may
lawfully limit such activity. As stated
above, employees may contact the NLRB
with specific questions about the
lawfulness of their employers’ rules
governing solicitation and literature
distribution.
Turning to the suggestion that the
notice should be modified to remove the
reference to union solicitation in favor
of a reference only to the right to engage
in union talk, the Board agrees in part.
The Board distinguishes between
soliciting for a union, which generally
means encouraging a co-worker to
participate in supporting a union, and
union talk, which generally refers to
discussions about the advantages and
disadvantages of unionization. Scripps
Memorial Hosp., 347 NLRB 52 (2006).
The right to talk about terms and
conditions of employment, which
would necessarily include union talk, is
encompassed more specifically by the
‘‘discussion’’ provision in the
affirmative rights section of the notice.
That provision indicates that employees
have the right to ‘‘discuss your terms
and conditions of employment or union
organizing with your co-workers or a
union.’’ In order to maintain
consistency and clarity throughout the
notice, the Board agrees that some
change is necessary to the solicitation
provision. Accordingly, the final notice
will state that it is illegal for an
employer to ‘‘prohibit you from talking
about or soliciting for a union during
non-work time, such as before or after
work or during break times; or from
distributing union literature during nonwork
time, in non-work areas, such as
parking lots or break rooms.’’
ii. Questioning Employees About Union
Activity
The Board received one comment
concerning this provision, suggesting
that it was confusing. The Board
believes the existing language is
sufficiently clear.
iii. Taking Adverse Action Against
Employees for Engaging in Union-
Related Activity
The Board did not receive any
specific comments regarding this
provision.
iv. Threats To Close
A few comments from employer
groups criticize the perceived
overgeneralization of this provision.
Those comments note that, as with
unlawful interrogation, a threat to close
is evaluated under a totality of
circumstances, and that an employer is
permitted to state the effects of
unionization on the company so long as
the statement is based on demonstrably
probable consequences of unionization.
The Board agrees that the law in this
general area is complex and that
predictions of plant closure based on
demonstrably probable consequences of
unionization may be lawful. NLRB v.
Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 618
(1969). However, the example in the
proposed notice is not such a
prediction; rather, the notice states that
it is unlawful for an employer to
‘‘threaten to close your workplace if
workers choose a union to represent
them.’’ Such a statement, which clearly
indicates that the employer will close
the plant in retaliation against the
employees for choosing union
representation, is unlawful. Id. at 618–
619. Thus, the Board finds it
unnecessary to modify or delete this
provision of the notice.
v. Promising Benefits
VerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00020 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2
The Board received one comment
addressing this provision. The comment
argues that the provision is ‘‘troubling’’
because it may be interpreted by a
reader to mean ‘‘anytime their employer
seeks to make such improvements it
discourages union support because
improved wages and benefits may
reduce employee’s interest in a union.’’
The Board does not think such an
Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations
54025
mstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2
interpretation would be reasonable,
because it is contrary to the plain
language of the notice. The notice states
that promises or grants of benefits ‘‘to
discourage or encourage union support’’
are unlawful. It would make little sense
to use such language if the Board had
meant that any promises or grants of
benefits were unlawful, rather than only
those with the unlawful stated
purposes. And stating that such
promises or grants to * * * encourage
union support are unlawful necessarily
implies that not all promises and grants
of benefits discourage union support.
vi. Prohibitions on Union Insignia
A few comments suggest that the
provision fails to illuminate the
conditions under which ‘‘special
circumstances’’ may exist, including in
hotels or retail establishments where the
insignia may interfere with the
employer’s public image, or when the
insignia is profane or vulgar. Another
comment indicates that the provision is
overly broad because it does not reflect
that a violation depends on the work
environment and the content of the
insignia. All the comments addressing
this provision suggest either adding
more detail to the provision to narrow
its meaning, or striking the provision
entirely.
Again, the Board disagrees.
Employees have a statutorily protected
right to wear union insignia unless the
employer is able to demonstrate
‘‘special circumstances’’ that justify a
prohibition. Republic Aviation Corp. v.
NLRB, 324 U.S. 793 (1945). For reasons
of format, the notice cannot
accommodate those comments
suggesting that this provision specify
cases in which the Board has found
‘‘special circumstances,’’ such as where
insignia might interfere with production
or safety; where it conveys a message
that is obscene or disparages a
company’s product or service; where it
interferes with an employer’s attempts
to have its employees project a specific
image to customers; where it hinders
production; where it causes disciplinary
problems in the plant; where it is in an
immediate patient care areas; or where
it would have any other consequences
that would constitute special
circumstances under settled precedent.
NLRB v. Mead Corp., 73 F.3d 74, 79 (6th
Cir. 1996), enfg. Escanaba Paper Co.,
314 NLRB 732 (1994).
Given the lengthy list of potential
special circumstances, the addition of
one or two examples of special
circumstances might mislead or confuse
employees into thinking that the right to
wear union insignia in all other
circumstances was absolute. And
including an entire list of special
circumstances, concerning both the
wearing of union insignia and other
matters (e.g., striking and picketing,
soliciting and distributing union
literature), would make it impossible to
summarize NLRA rights on an 11x17
inch poster. In any event, the Board
finds that the general caveat that special
circumstances may defeat the
application of the general rule, coupled
with the advice to employees to contact
the NLRB with specific questions about
particular issues, achieves the balance
required for an employee notice of
rights about wearing union insignia in
the workplace.
vii. Spying or Videotaping
Aside from the few comments that
suggest the provision be stricken, only
one comment specifically addresses the
content of this provision. The comment
states that the language is confusing
because a ‘‘supervisor might believe it
would be permissible to photograph or
tape record a union meeting. Another
might say that their video camera
doesn’t use tape so it’s okay to use.’’ The
Board has determined that no change is
necessary. In the Board’s view, it is
unlikely that a reasonable supervisor
would construe this notice language
(which also says that it is unlawful to
‘‘spy on’’ employees’ peaceful union
activities) as indicating that it is
unlawful to videotape, but lawful to
tape record or photograph, such
activities. Supervisors are free to contact
the Board if they are unsure whether a
contemplated response to union activity
might be unlawful.
viii. Other Suggested Additions to
Illegal Employer Conduct
The Heritage Foundation suggests that
the Board add language to the notice
informing employees that if they choose
to be represented by a union, their
employer may not give them raises or
bonuses for good performance without
first bargaining with the union. The
comment suggests that the Board add
the following provision ‘‘if a union
represents you and your co-workers,
give you a pay raise or a bonus, or
reduce or dock your pay, without
negotiating with the union.’’ The Board
rejects this suggestion for the same
reason it rejects other comments
contending that the notice should
include the consequences of
unionization in the summary of NLRA
rights, above.
The National Immigration Law Center
suggests that the Board add the
following to the notice poster:
Under the NLRA, it is illegal for your
employer to: Report you or threaten to report
VerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00021 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2
you to Immigration and Customs
Enforcement (ICE) or to other law
enforcement authorities in order to
intimidate or retaliate against you because
you join or support a union, or because you
engage in concerted activity for mutual aid
and protection.
The Board finds it unnecessary to add
this statement. The notice states that it
is unlawful for an employer to ‘‘fire,
demote, or transfer you, or reduce your
hours or change your shift, or otherwise
take adverse action against you, or
threaten to take any of these actions,
because you join or support a union, or
because you engage in concerted
activity for mutual aid and protection
(emphasis added) [.]’’ Reporting or
threatening to report an employee in the
manner described in the comment
would be a form of adverse action or
threat thereof, and the Board believes
that it would be understood as such.
d. Examples of Illegal Union Activity
The proposed notice contained the
following examples of unlawful union
conduct:
Under the NLRA, it is illegal for a
union or for the union that represents
you in bargaining with your employer
to:
Threaten you that you will lose your job
unless you support the union.
Refuse to process a grievance because you
have criticized union officials or because you
are not a member of the union.
Use or maintain discriminatory standards
or procedures in making job referrals from a
hiring hall.
Cause or attempt to cause an employer to
discriminate against you because of your
union-related activity.
Take other adverse action against you
based on whether you have joined or support
the union.
75 FR 80419.
There were only a few comments
addressing specific changes to the
language in this section of the notice.
ALFA criticizes the provision that states
that a union may not ‘‘threaten you that
you will lose your job unless you
support the union,’’ because the
proposed language ‘‘fails to capture
Section 8(b)(1)(A)’s broader prohibition
against restraint and coercion.’’ The
comment suggests revising the language
to state that a union may not ‘‘[r]estrain
or coerce you in the exercise of your
right to refrain from joining a union by
threatening to inflict bodily harm or
following you to your home and
refusing to leave unless you sign a
union card.’’ That comment also
suggests adding a provision stating that
it is unlawful for a union to ‘‘promise
to waive your union initiation fee if you
agree to sign a union card before a vote
is taken.’’
54026 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations
mstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2
Another comment argues that the
illegal union conduct portion of the
notice fails to fully inform employees of
their rights as union members. 109 In
contrast, another comment states a
different position—that the list of illegal
union conduct ‘‘ostensibly relates only
to restraint or coercion by a union in a
unionized environment.’’ 110 The
comment further states that the Board
should have included examples of
‘‘union restraint or coercion in an
organizing setting’’ but gives no specific
examples.
ALFA suggests three changes to the
unlawful union activity section. First,
rather than say that the union may not
‘‘threaten you that you will lose your
job,’’ a more comprehensive statement
would be ‘‘threaten, harass, or coerce
you in order to gain your support for the
union.’’ The Board agrees, except as
regards ‘‘harass,’’ which is sometimes
used to characterize almost any sort of
union solicitation. Accordingly, the
statement will be modified to read
‘‘threaten or coerce you in order to gain
your support for the union.’’ Second,
the comment suggests changing ‘‘cause
or attempt to cause an employer to
discriminate against you’’ to
‘‘discriminate or attempt to discriminate
against you because you don’t support
a union.’’ The Board disagrees, because
the suggested change would shift the
focus of the provision away from the
sort of conduct contemplated in the
rule. See NLRA Section 8(b)(2), 29
U.S.C. 158(b)(2). Third, the comment
suggests changing ‘‘take other adverse
action against you based on whether
you have joined or support the union’’
to ‘‘take adverse action against you
because you have not joined or do not
support the union.’’ The Board agrees
and will modify this provision of the
notice accordingly.
Baker & McKenzie urges that a variety
of other examples of unlawful union
conduct be added to the notice,
including requiring nonmembers to pay
a fee to receive contract benefits,
disciplining members for engaging in
activity adverse to a union-represented
grievant, disciplining members for
refusing to engage in unprotected
activity, engaging in careless grievance
handling, failing to notify employees of
their Beck rights, requiring employees to
agree to dues checkoff instead of direct
payment, discriminatorily applying
hiring hall rules, and conditioning
continued employment on the payment
of a fine or dues in ‘‘right-to-work’’
states.
109 See comment of National Association of
Manufacturers.
110 See comment of ALFA.
As with the examples of unlawful
employer activity, the Board concludes
that the provisions concerning unlawful
union activity, as proposed, are accurate
and informative, and, as with the notice
as a whole, strike an appropriate
balance between being simultaneously
instructive and succinct. Moreover, the
Board finds it unnecessary to include
additional examples of unlawful
conduct so that the lists of employer
and union activity are the same length
because the notice describes the central
forms of unlawful conduct engaged in
by each type of entity. Still less is it
necessary to add a host of additional
examples of unlawful union conduct,
with the result that the list of such
conduct would be much longer than the
list of unlawful employer conduct. In
the Board’s view, the list of unlawful
union conduct in the proposed notice
fairly informs employees of the types of
conduct that a union is prohibited from
engaging in without providing
unnecessary or confusing examples.
Employees may contact the NLRB if
they believe a union has violated the
NLRA.
e. Collective-Bargaining Provision
The collective-bargaining provision of
the NPRM states that ‘‘if you and your
co-workers select a union to act as your
collective bargaining representatives,
your employer and the union are
required to bargain in good faith and in
a genuine effort to reach a written,
binding agreement setting your terms
and conditions of employment. The
union is required to fairly represent you
in bargaining and enforcing the
agreement.’’ 75 FR 80419.
The Board received only a few
comments on this provision of the
notice. Notably, COLLE requests the
inclusion of a limitation on the
provision that employees have the right
to bargain collectively, in order to
clarify that the employer’s obligation is
only to bargain in good faith and not
necessarily to reach an agreement. A
second comment suggests that the
notice inform employees that they have
the right to ‘‘sue a union for unfairly
representing the employee in
bargaining, contract administration, or a
discrimination matter.’’
The Board has decided that no
changes are necessary to the duty to
bargain paragraph. The Board is
satisfied that the proposed collectivebargaining
provision provides sufficient
guidance to employees about the
exercise of these rights while still
staying within the constraints set by a
necessarily brief employee notice. As to
the first comment, the notice states that
an employer and union have a duty to
‘‘bargain in good faith and in a genuine
effort to reach a written, binding
agreement.’’ As discussed above, by
referring to a ‘‘genuine effort’’ to reach
agreement, the notice necessarily
implies that the parties are not obliged
to actually reach one. The duty to
bargain in good faith has many
components. See NLRB v. Katz, 369 U.S.
736 (1962). And the suggestion that
employers do not have to agree to
certain proposals, although correct, does
not account for the line of cases that
suggest that an important ingredient in
good faith bargaining is a willingness to
compromise. See Phelps Dodge, 337
NLRB 455 (2002).
Turning to the suggestion that the
notice include language informing
employees of their right to ‘‘sue’’ the
union if it fails to represent them fairly,
the Board has concluded that the notice
sufficiently apprises employees of their
right to fair representation and of their
right to file unfair labor practice charges
with the Board should a union fail to
fulfill that duty. The rights that
employees have to sue unions directly
in court without coming to the Board
are beyond the scope of this rulemaking.
f. Coverage Provision
VerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2
In regard to coverage under the NLRA,
the proposed notice states:
The National Labor Relations Act covers
most private-sector employers. Excluded
from coverage under the NLRA are publicsector
employees, agricultural and domestic
workers, independent contractors, workers
employed by a parent or spouse, employees
of air and rail carriers covered by the Railway
Labor Act, and supervisors (although
supervisors that have been discriminated
against for refusing to violate the NLRA may
be covered). 75 FR 80419.
A comment from the National
Immigration Law Center suggests adding
the following language: ‘‘The NLRA
protects the above-enumerated rights of
all employees, irrespective of their
immigration status. That protection
extends to employees without work
authorization, though certain remedies
in those circumstances may be limited.
Employers cannot threaten you or
intimidate you on the basis of you
immigration status to prevent you from
joining or supporting a union, or
engaging in concerted activity for
mutual aid and protection.’’
The Board has decided not to amend
the coverage provision in the final
notice. Although the Board understands
that many immigrant employees may be
unsure whether they are covered by the
NLRA, the notice does not include a list
of covered employees. Including
specific coverage of immigrants, but not
other classes of employees, may cause
Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations
54027
mstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2
confusion for many employees.
Currently, the language in the notice
tracks statutory language and provides
only the list of employees excluded
from coverage. As a result, those
employees not listed under the
exclusions will reasonably believe they
are covered employees under the
statute. Any employees who are unsure
of their status should contact a regional
office of the NLRB.
The final notice as modified is set
forth in the Appendix to Subpart A of
this rule.
2. Posting Issues
The Board proposed that the notice to
employees shall be at least 11 inches by
17 inches in size, and in such colors and
type size and style as the Board shall
prescribe. The proposed rule further
provides that employers that choose to
print the notice after downloading it
from the Board’s Web site must print in
color, and the printed notice shall be at
least 11 inches by 17 inches in size.
Proposed § 104.202(d) requires all
covered employers to post the employee
notice physically ‘‘in conspicuous
places, including all places where
notices to employees are customarily
posted.’’ Employers must take steps to
ensure that the notice is not altered,
defaced, or covered with other material.
Proposed § 104.202(e) states that the
Board will print the notice poster and
provide copies to employers on request.
It also states that employers may
download copies of the poster from the
Board’s Web site, http://www.nlrb.gov,
for their use. It further provides that
employers may reproduce exact
duplicates of the poster supplied by the
Board, and that they may also use
commercial poster services to provide
the employee notice consolidated onto
one poster with other Federally
mandated labor and employment
notices, as long as consolidation does
not alter the size, color, or content of the
poster provided by the Board. Finally,
employers that have significant numbers
of employees who are not proficient in
English will be required to post notices
of employee rights in the language or
languages spoken by significant
numbers of those employees. The Board
will make available posters containing
the necessary translations.
In addition to requiring physical
posting of paper notices, proposed
§ 104.202(f) requires that notices be
distributed electronically, such as by e-
mail, posting on an intranet or an
internet site, and/or other electronic
means, if the employer customarily
communicates with its employees by
such means. 111 An employer that
customarily posts notices to its
employees on an intranet or internet site
must display the required employee
notice on such a site prominently—i.e.,
no less prominently than other notices
to employees. The Board proposed to
give employers two options to satisfy
this requirement. An employer may
either download the notice itself and
post it in the manner described above,
or post, in the same manner, a link to
the Board’s Web site that contains the
full text of the required employee
notice. In the latter case, the proposed
rule states that the link must contain the
prescribed introductory language from
the poster, which appears in Appendix
to Subpart A, below. An employer that
customarily communicates with its
employees by e-mail will satisfy the
electronic posting requirement by
sending its employees an e-mail
message containing the link described
above.
The proposed rule provides that,
where a significant number of an
employer’s employees are not proficient
in English, the employer must provide
the required electronic notice in the
language the employees speak. This
requirement can be met either by
downloading and posting, as required in
§ 104.202(f), the translated version of
the notice supplied by the Board, or by
prominently displaying, as required in
§ 104.202(f), a link to the Board’s Web
site that contains the full text of the
poster in the language the employees
speak. The Board will provide
translations of that link. 75 FR 80417.
Section 104.203 of the proposed rule
provides that Federal contractors may
comply with the requirements of the
rule by posting the notices to employees
required under the Department of
Labor’s notice-posting rule, 29 CFR part
471. Id.
The Board solicited comments on its
proposed requirements for both physical
and electronic notice posting. In
addition, the Board solicited comments
on whether it should prescribe
standards regarding the size, clarity,
location, and brightness of the
electronic link, including how to
prescribe electronic postings that are at
least as large, clear, and conspicuous as
the employer’s other postings.
The Board received numerous
comments concerning the technical
requirements for posting the notices of
employee rights. Those comments
address the locations where notices
would be physically posted, physical
characteristics of the posters,
111 See J. Picini Flooring, 356 NLRB No. 9, slip op.
at 6 (2010).
requirements for posting in languages
other than English, details of the
requirement for electronic posting of
notices by employers that customarily
communicate with their employees
electronically, and ‘‘safe harbor’’
provisions for Federal contractors that
are already posting the Department of
Labor’s notice of NLRA rights.
a. Location of Posting
VerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2
Section 104.202(d) of the proposed
rule requires that the notice be posted
‘‘in conspicuous places, including all
places where notices to employees are
customarily posted.’’ Some employers
and their representatives, including law
firm Baker & McKenzie, comment that
the proposed rule does not define
‘‘customarily.’’ The Board responds that
the term is used in its normal meaning
of ‘‘ordinarily’’ or ‘‘usually,’’ as it has
been used in the Board’s remedial
orders for decades. 112 This standard is
consistent with the posting
requirements in the regulations and
statutes of other agencies. 113 Baker &
McKenzie’s comment contends that the
quoted phrase should read instead
‘‘where other legally-required notices to
employees are customarily posted.’’ The
Board disagrees. As under the
Department of Labor’s notice posting
requirement, 114 the Board’s final rule
clarifies that the notice must be posted
wherever notices to employees
regarding personnel rules and policies
are customarily posted and are readily
seen by employees, not simply where
other legally mandated notices are
posted.
A number of comments from
employers 115 and individuals take the
position that it is time to move away
from paper posters and to encourage
employees to inform themselves of their
rights through the Internet. Many
comments object that the posting
requirement will add to already
cluttered bulletin boards or necessitate
additional bulletin boards. 116 The Board
responds to these comments above in

Enterprises further maintains that the
requirement to ensure that the notice is
conspicuous and not altered or defaced
imposes an unnecessary burden on
employers. Caremaster Medical
Services’ comment asks whether
periodic inspections of the notices will
be conducted and, if so, by whom.
Specifically, this comment expresses
concern that employers will be forced to
permit union officials to enter their
facilities to inspect the notices. The rule
does not provide for such inspections or
alter current standards regarding union
access to employers’ premises. Rather,
the Board contemplates that an
employer’s failure to comply with the
rule will be brought to the attention of
the employer or the Board by employees
or union representatives who are
lawfully on the premises.
The International Union of Operating
Engineers comments that the rule needs
to apply to the marine construction
industry, in which employees work at
remote sites and do not necessarily see
a posting in the office. Another
comment similarly states that the rule is
not practical for small employers with
dispersed employees, e.g., trucking or
insurance companies. 117 Similarly, one
comment contends that the requirement
is burdensome for construction
employers, whose employees report to
various worksites. 118 The Board
recognizes that certain work situations,
such as those mentioned in the
comments, present special challenges
with regard to physical posting.
However, the Board concludes that
these employers must nonetheless post
the required notice at their work
premises in accordance with the
proposed rule. Electronic posting will
also aid the employers in providing the
notice to their employees in the manner
in which they customarily communicate
with them.
TLC Companies contends that
professional employer organizations
(PEOs) such as itself should be exempt
from the rule’s requirements. It explains
that PEOs are ‘‘co-employers’’ of a client
employer’s employees, providing
payroll and other administrative
services. However, it asserts that PEOs
have no control over the client
employer’s worksite. Accordingly, TLC
Companies is concerned that a PEO
could be found liable for its client’s
failure to post the notice. The Board
contemplates that employers will be
required to physically post a notice only
on their own premises or at worksites
where the employer has the ability to

post a notice or cause a notice to be
posted directed to its own employees.
Retail Industry Leaders Association
asks whether the rule would apply to
overseas employees of American
employers. The answer to that question
is generally ‘‘no’’; the Board’s
jurisdiction does not extend to
American employees engaged in
permanent employment abroad in
locations over which the United States
has no legislative control. See Computer
Sciences Raytheon, 318 NLRB 966
(1995). Employers of employees who are
working abroad only temporarily are not
required to post the notice in foreign
workplaces.
b. Size and Form Requirements
Many comments from organizations
and individuals object to the 11x17-inch
size prescribed by the proposed rule. 119
They argue that most employers do not
have the capacity to make 11x17-inch
color copies and will have to use
commercial copy services, which some
contend are expensive. A human
resources official also asserts that other
required notices are smaller, and that
the larger poster will be more eyecatching,
implying that NLRA rights are
more important. Other comments
support the proposed 11x17-inch size,
stating that the notice should stand out
and be in large print, with one comment
specifying that the title should be
larger. 120 The AFL–CIO argues that
employers should not be permitted to
download the notice from the Board’s
Web site if their limited printing
capacity would make it less eyecatching.
A few comments contend that the
prescribed size will make it difficult to
include in consolidated posters of
various statutory rights, as the proposed
rule permits. 121 One comment urges the
Board to follow the ‘‘3′ rule,’’ according
to which a notice is large enough if it
can be read from a distance of 3 feet, 122
and another suggests only a legibility
requirement. 123 One comment states
that minor deviations, such as 1 ⁄4 inch,
should not be deemed violations. 124
Another comment expresses a concern
that a large, prominent poster could
cause a few unhappy employees to
begin activity that could result in
divisiveness in a small facility. 125
119 See, e.g., comment of Associated General

The Board has decided to retain the
11x17-inch poster size. As the NPRM
states, the Board will furnish paper
copies of the notice, at no charge, to
employers that ask for them. Employers
that prefer to download and print the
notice from the Board’s Web site will
have two formats available: a one-page
11x17-inch version and a two-page 8
1
⁄2x11-inch version, which must be
printed in landscape format and taped
together to form the 11x17-inch poster.
In response to the comments objecting
to the added expense of obtaining color
copies through outside sources, the
Board has revised the rule to delete the
requirement that reproductions of the
notice be in color, provided that the
reproductions otherwise conform to the
Board-provided notice. Accordingly, the
Board concludes that obtaining copies
of the notice will not be difficult or
expensive for employers.
The Board finds no merit to the other
objections to the 11x17-inch poster size.
Contrary to some comments, the Board
does not believe that employees would
think that NLRA rights are more
important than other statutory rights,
merely because the notice of NLRA
rights is somewhat larger than notices
prescribed under some other statutes. It
would seem that, upon learning of all of
their rights in the workplace, employees
will determine from their understanding
of the rights themselves, rather than the
size of the various posters, which rights
(if any) are more important to them than
others. In the Board’s view, adopting a
subjective ‘‘3′ rule’’ or a ‘‘legibility
standard’’ could lead to disagreements
over whether a particular poster was
‘‘legible’’ or could be read at a distance
of 3 feet. In addition, if, as some
comments contend (without citing
specifics), the size of the Board’s notice
will pose a problem for manufacturers
of consolidated posters to include it
with posters detailing other workplace
rights, that would seem to be a problem
best left to those manufacturers to solve.
c. Language Issues
VerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00024 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2
The proposed rule requires that,
‘‘[w]here a significant portion of an
employer’s workforce is not proficient
in English, the employer must provide
the notice in the language the
employees speak.’’ This is the same
standard applied in the Department of
Labor’s notice of NLRA rights for federal
contractors (29 CFR 471.2(d)) and in the
notice required under the Family and
Medical Leave Act (29 CFR 825.300(4)).
Many comments support the
requirement and availability of
translated notices, particularly as an
essential way of informing immigrant
Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations
54029
mstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2
employees about their rights. 126 But
several comments complain that the
rule does not define ‘‘significant.’’ 127
Baker & McKenzie proposes that the
standard be 40 percent specifically of
the employer’s production and
maintenance workforce, while the
National Immigration Law Center
proposes a 5 percent standard. Another
comment urges that translated notices
be required whenever any of the
employees are not proficient in
English. 128 The U.S. Chamber of
Commerce asserts that a safe harbor is
needed for employers when a notice in
a particular language is not yet available
from the Board. Moreover, a few
comments contend that the Board
should also provide Braille notices for
vision-impaired employees, as well as
audio versions for illiterate employees,
and versions of the notice that are
adaptable to assistive technologies. 129
One individual proposes that the rule
mandate that employers read the notice
to employees when they are hired and
to all employees annually.
Having carefully considered the
comments, the Board has decided to
define ‘‘significant’’ in terms of foreignlanguage
speakers as 20 percent or more
of an employer’s workforce. Thus, if as
many as 20 percent of an employer’s
employees are not proficient in English
but speak the same foreign language, the
employer must post the notice in that
language, both physically and
electronically (if the employer is
otherwise required to post the notice
electronically). If an employer’s
workforce includes two or more groups
constituting at least 20 percent of the
workforce who speak different
languages, the employer must either
physically post the notice in each of
those languages or, at the employer’s
option, post the notice in the language
spoken by the largest group of
employees and provide each employee
in each of the other language groups a
copy of the notice in the appropriate
language. If such an employer is also
required to post the notice
electronically, it must do so in each of
those languages. If some of an
employer’s employees speak a language
not spoken by employees constituting at
least 20 percent of the employer’s
workforce, the employer is encouraged,
but not required, either to provide the

Foundation; Georgetown law students.
notice to those employees in their
respective language or languages or to
direct them to the Board’s Web site,
http://www.nlrb.gov, where they can
obtain copies of the notice in their
respective languages. The Board has
also decided to add to the notice
instructions for obtaining foreignlanguage
translations of the notice.
Employers will be required to request
foreign-language notices from the Board
or obtain them from the Board’s Web
site in the same manner as the Englishlanguage
notice. If an employer requests
from the Board a notice in a particular
language in which the notice is not
available, the requesting employer will
not be liable for non-compliance with
the rule until the notice becomes
available in that language.
With respect to employees who are
vision-impaired or those who are
illiterate, employers may consult the
Board’s Regional Office on a case-bycase
basis for guidance on appropriate
methods of providing the required
notice, including by audio recording.
d. Electronic Posting
Many employer comments oppose the
requirement for electronic notice. The
Coalition for a Democratic Workplace
points out that other agencies do not
require both electronic and physical
posting and asserts that only one
method is necessary. For example, the
Coalition notes that the Family and
Medical Leave Act notice obligation is
satisfied by electronic posting alone,
and other statutes do not mention
electronic posting. The National Council
of Agricultural Employers urges the
Board to require electronic posting only
if the employer posts other statutory or
regulatory notices in that fashion.
Another proposes that employers be
permitted to choose either physical or
electronic posting. The National
Association of Manufacturers remarks
that the proposed rule breaks new
ground for using an employer’s email
system to communicate information
about ‘‘union membership.’’ The U.S.
Chamber of Commerce suggests that this
aspect of the rule would chill
employers’ use of new technologies. On
the other hand, the AFL–CIO and
several other commenters 130 support
electronic as well as physical posting;
the Center for American Progress Action
Fund, among others, points out that
electronic communications at work are
standard now.
After carefully considering these
comments, the Board concludes that
electronic posting will substantially
130 See, e.g., comments of Gibson, Dunn, Cohen,
Leifer & Yellig, P.C.; Beeson, Tayer & Bodine.
VerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00025 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2
assist in providing the prescribed notice
to employees. As some comments state,
electronic communication is now a
routine practice in many workplaces
and the source of much information
from employers to their employees.
However, the Board has clarified the
final rule to mandate only that, if an
employer customarily communicates
personnel rules or policies to its
employees in that manner, it must also
do so with respect to the notice of
employee rights under the NLRA. The
concern that the rule will discourage
employers from using new technologies
is apparently not widely shared and, in
the Board’s view, is implausible.
Although the Board recognizes that
some other statutes and regulations do
not require electronic notice, it notes
that they generally predated the routine
use of electronic communications in the
workplace. Having only recently begun
ordering electronic posting of remedial
notices, 131 the Board has limited
experience in this area, and employers
are encouraged to contact the local
Regional Office with questions about
this provision. The Board does not agree
that employers should be permitted to
choose whether to provide physical or
electronic notice, because some
employers could select the less effective
of these alternatives, thus undermining
the purpose of the rule. Finally, the
rights stated in the notice are not
accurately described as pertaining solely
to union membership, and the notice is
not intended to promote union
membership or union representation.
Rather, the notice addresses a broad
range of employee legal rights under the
NLRA, which involve protected
concerted activity as well as union
activity in both organized and
unorganized workplaces, and also the
right to refrain from any such activity.
Many employer comments note that
the proposed rule also does not define
‘‘customarily’’ as it pertains to
electronic posting in § 104.202(f), i.e.,
the type and degree of communication
that triggers the requirement. 132
Numerous employers also participated
in a postcard campaign objecting,
among other things, that employers use
a wide variety of technology to
communicate with employees and that
the rule could require them to use all
methods to convey the notice. 133 For

example, they ask whether an employer
that occasionally uses text messaging or
Twitter to communicate with employees
would have to use those technologies
and, if so, how they would be able to
comply with the rule, in view of the
length restrictions of these media. The
U.S. Chamber of Commerce raises the
same issue regarding faxing, voice mail,
and instant messaging. The National
Roofing Contractors Association notes
that some employers use email to
communicate with certain employees,
while other employees have no access to
email during their work day. As to email
communication itself, an individual
observes that many employees change
jobs every 3 to 4 years, and an email
reaches only those in the workforce at
a specific time. The same comment
notes that the proposed rule does not
state when or how often email notice
should be provided. Three Georgetown
law students recommend that the rule
mandate email as well as intranet notice
to employees when it goes into effect
and written notice to new employees
within a week of their starting
employment.
The Board responds that, as discussed
above regarding the location of posting,
‘‘customarily’’ is used in its normal
meaning. This provision of the rule
would not apply to an employer that
only occasionally uses electronic means
to communicate with employees.
However, in view of the numerous
comments expressing concern over the
proposed rule’s email posting
requirements, the Board has decided not
to require employers to provide the
notice to employees by means of email
and the other forms of electronic
communication listed in the previous
paragraph. In the Board’s judgment, the
potential for confusion and the prospect
of requiring repeated notifications in
order to reach new employees outweigh
the benefits that could be derived at the
margin from such notifications. All
employers subject to the rule will be
required to post the notice physically in
their facilities; and employers who
customarily post notices to employees
regarding personnel rules or policies on
an internet or intranet site will be
required to post the Board’s notice on
those sites as well. Moreover, those
notices (unlike the Board’s election and
remedial notices) must remain posted;
thus, it is reasonable to expect that even
though some employees may not see the
notices immediately, more and more
will see them and learn about their
NLRA rights as time goes by.
Accordingly, the only electronic
Mount Sterling, Kentucky Chamber of Commerce;
U.S. Xpress, Inc.
postings required under the final rule
will be those on internet or intranet
sites.
Many comments address the
characteristics of electronic posting, as
prescribed in § 104.202(f). In the NPRM,
the Board proposed not to prescribe the
size, clarity, location, or brightness of an
electronic notice or link to the notice,
but rather require that it be at least as
prominent as other electronic notices to
employees, as the Department of Labor’s
rule requires. No comments suggest
more specific requirements; the
Michigan Health & Hospital Association
argues that such requirements would
result in inadvertent noncompliance.
The Board has decided to adopt the
Department of Labor’s approach, as
proposed in the NPRM.
Baker & McKenzie urges that the title
of the link in the proposed rule be
changed to ‘‘Employee Rights under the
National Labor Relations Act’’ rather
than ‘‘Important Notice about
Employees Rights to Organize and
Bargain Collectively with Their
Employers.’’ The Board agrees and has
revised the rule accordingly.
A comment from Vigilant states that
a link to the Board’s Web site, which is
one means of electronic posting, should
not be required to include the
introductory language of the notice. The
Board agrees, noting that the
Department of Labor takes this
approach, and will not require that
electronic links to the Board’s Web site
include the introductory language.
For the foregoing reasons, the Board
has decided to retain the posting
requirements as proposed in the NPRM,
modified as indicated above.
e. Compliance With the Department of
Labor’s Rule
Several comments opposing the
proposed rule urge that, if the rule
becomes final, the Board should retain
the ‘‘safe harbor’’ provided for Federal
contractors that comply with the
Department of Labor’s notice posting
rule. 134 However, the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce states that some employers
post the Department of Labor’s notice at
facilities where it is not required or
where Federal contract work is
performed only sporadically. It
questions whether such employers must
replace the Department of Labor’s notice
with the Board’s when no contract work
is being performed, or whether they can
comply with the Board’s rule by leaving
the Department of Labor’s notice in
place. The Chamber proposes that
134 See, e.g., comments of IFDA; Estes; The Sack
Company; National Roofing Contractors
Association.
employers be allowed to choose to
maintain the Department of Labor’s
notice, although another comment
asserts that employees might think that
the notice is no longer applicable
because of the lack of a current contract.
Another comment raises the possibility
that either the Board or the Department
of Labor could decide to change its
notice and emphasized that they need to
be identical in order to provide the safe
harbor. The Board responds that a
Federal contractor that complies with
the Department of Labor’s noticeposting
rule will be deemed in
compliance with the Board’s
requirement. 135
3. Exceptions
VerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2
The rule applies only to employers
that are subject to the NLRA. Under
NLRA Section 2(2), ‘‘employer’’
excludes the United States government,
any wholly owned government
corporation, any Federal Reserve Bank,
any State or political subdivision, and
any person subject to the Railway Labor
Act, 45 U.S.C. 151 et seq. 29 U.S.C.
152(2). Thus, under the proposed rule,
those excluded entities are not required
to post the notice of employee rights.
The proposed rule also does not apply
to entities that employ only individuals
who are not considered ‘‘employees’’
under the NLRA. See Subpart A, below;
29 U.S.C. 152(3). Finally, the proposed
rule does not apply to entities over
which the Board has been found not to
have jurisdiction, or over which the
Board has chosen through regulation or
adjudication not to assert
jurisdiction. 136 The Board proposed that
all employers covered under the NLRA
would be subject to the notice posting
rule. 75 FR 80413.
The Coalition for a Democratic
Workplace argues that the final rule
cannot be applied to religiouslyaffiliated
employers. The Coalition
argues that assertion of jurisdiction
would ‘‘substantially burden [such
employers’] exercise of religion in
violation of both the First Amendment
and the Religious Freedom Restoration
Act.’’ Similarly, Seyfarth Shaw contends
that religiously-affiliated healthcare
135 A few comments ask whether the Board’s rule
would preempt the Department of Labor’s rule.
Because the answer to that question would not
affect the validity of the Board’s rule, the Board
finds it unnecessary to take a position on that issue
in this proceeding.
136 The proposed rule excludes small businesses
whose impact on interstate commerce is de minimis
or so slight that they do not meet the Board’s
discretionary jurisdiction requirements. See
generally An Outline of Law and Procedure in
Representation Cases, Chapter 1, found on the
Board’s Web site, http://www.nlrb.gov, and cases
cited therein.

54031
mstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2
institutions should be excluded from
coverage if they are nonprofit and hold
themselves out to the public as being
religious.
The Board examines jurisdictional
issues on a case-by-case basis, and the
Board’s jurisdiction jurisprudence is
highly complex. The Board has asserted
jurisdiction over some religiouslyaffiliated
employers in the past, but has
declined to assert jurisdiction over other
religiously-affiliated employers. See,
e.g., Ecclesiastical Maintenance Service,
320 NLRB 70 (1995), and St. Edmund’s
High School, 337 NLRB 1260 (2002). In
Ukiah Valley Medical Center, the Board
found that neither the First Amendment
nor the Religious Restoration Act
precludes the Board from asserting
jurisdiction over a religiously-affiliated
employer. 332 NLRB 602 (2000). If an
employer is unsure whether the Board
has jurisdiction over its operations, it
may contact the Board’s regional office.
In its comment, the United Stated
Postal Service points out that it has
different statutory rules from those
covering other private sector employees.
Labor relations in the Postal Service are
governed by Chapter 12 of the Postal
Reorganization Act of 1970, 39 U.S.C.
1201 et seq. Section 1209(a) of the
Postal Reorganization Act generally
makes the NLRA applicable to all
employee-management relations ‘‘to the
extent not inconsistent with the
provisions of this title.’’ As raised by the
comment, there are indeed several areas
in which the Postal Reorganization Act
is inconsistent with the NLRA. The
principal differences are that an agency
shop is prohibited (id. section 1209(a))
and that postal employees may not
strike. Id. Section
410(b)(1)(incorporating 5 U.S.C. 7311).
In light of these differences, the Board
agrees that a postal worker-specific
notice is necessary. The Board,
however, does not wish to create a
notice without the benefit of specific
public comment on this issue.
Accordingly, the Board will exclude the
United States Postal Service from
coverage under the final rule; the Board
may, at a later date, request comments
on a postal worker-specific notice.
Subpart B—Enforcement and
Complaint Procedures
Subpart B of the rule contains
procedures for enforcement of the
employee notice-posting requirement. In
crafting Subpart B, the Board was
mindful of the need to identify an
effective remedy for noncompliance
with the notice-posting requirement.
The Board gave careful consideration to
several alternative approaches to
enforcing the rule’s notice-posting
requirements. Those alternatives, not all
of which are mutually exclusive, were
(1) Finding the failure to post the
required notices to be an unfair labor
practice; (2) tolling the statute of
limitations for filing unfair labor
practice charges against employers that
fail to post the notices; (3) considering
the willful failure to post the notices as
evidence of unlawful motive in unfair
labor practice cases; (4) voluntary
compliance. 75 FR 80413–80414.
As explained in the NPRM, the Board
considered but tentatively rejected
relying solely on voluntary compliance.
This option logically would appear to be
the least conducive to an effective
enforcement of the notice-posting
requirement, and the Board’s limited
experience with voluntary posting of
notices of employee rights seems to
confirm this. When an election petition
is filed, the Board’s Regional Office
sends the employer Form NLRB–5492,
Notice to Employees, together with a
leaflet containing significant ‘‘Rights of
Employees.’’ See the Board’s
Casehandling Manual, Part Two—
Representation Proceedings, Section
11008.5, found on the Board’s Web site,
http://www.nlrb.gov. The Regional
Office also asks employers to post the
notice of employee rights in the
workplace; however, the Board’s
experience is that the notices are seldom
posted. Id. at 80414. Moreover, because
the notice is voluntary and there is no
enforcement scheme, there is no remedy
to fix the problem when the notice is
not posted. The Board has found
nothing in the comments to the NPRM
that would give it reason to believe that
voluntary compliance would be any
more effective under the present notice
rule. Therefore, the Board has decided
not to rely on voluntary compliance.
Instead the final rule provides that
failing to post the notice may be found
to be an unfair labor practice and may
also, in appropriate circumstances, be
grounds for tolling the statute of
limitations. In addition, a knowing and
willful failure to post employee notices
may be found to be evidence of
unlawful motive in an unfair labor
practice case. (As the Board also
explained in the NPRM, it did not
consider imposing monetary fines for
noncompliance, because the Board lacks
the statutory authority to impose
‘‘penalties or fines.’’ See, e.g., Republic
Steel Corp. v. NLRB, 311 U.S. 7, 10–12
(1940).) These provisions have two
purposes: to ensure that any violations
of the notice-posting requirement that
occur may be remedied where
necessary, and to describe how
violations of the notice-posting
VerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2
requirement may affect other Board
proceedings. 137
The Board received several hundred
comments regarding the proposed
means of enforcing the notice posting
requirement. Those that favor
implementing the rule also favor the
proposed enforcement mechanisms. 138
Those opposing the rule generally
oppose all three enforcement
mechanisms.
A. Noncompliance as an Unfair Labor
Practice
The rule requires employers to inform
employees of their NLRA rights because
the Board believes that employees must
know their rights in order to exercise
them effectively. Accordingly, the Board
may find that an employer that fails or
refuses to post the required notice of
employee rights violates Section 8(a)(1)
of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. 158(a)(1) by
‘‘interfer[ing] with, restrain[ing], or
coerc[ing] employees in the exercise of
the rights guaranteed in section 7 (29
U.S.C. 157).’’
As it explained in the NPRM, the
Board expects that most employers that
fail to post the required notice will do
so simply because they are unaware of
the rule, and that when it is called to
their attention, they will comply
without the need for formal
administrative action or litigation.
When that is not the case, the Board’s
customary procedures for investigating
and adjudicating alleged unfair labor
practices may be invoked. See NLRA
Sections 10 and 11, 29 U.S.C. 160, 161;
29 CFR part 102, subpart B. 139 When the
Board finds a violation, it will
customarily order the employer to cease
and desist and to post the notice of
137 The tolling and animus provisions are not
remedies in the usual sense of the term; however,
these provisions inform the public of the impact
that violations of the notice posting obligation may
have in other NLRB proceedings. As described
below, these impacts are not a ‘‘punishment’’ for
noncompliance. To the contrary, the tolling
provision is intended to ensure that noncompliance
with the notice posting requirement does not
prejudice innocent employees. And the animus
provision is intended to inform the public that
knowing and willful violations of the rule may
support an inference of animus toward NLRA
rights.
138 See, e.g., Harkin and Miller, National
Employment Law Project, Public Justice Center, Inc.
139 The Board’s General Counsel has
unreviewable discretion as to whether to issue a
complaint in an unfair labor practice proceeding.
See, e.g., Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.S. 171, 182 (1967).
The General Counsel has exercised that discretion
to refuse to proceed with meritorious charges when
it would not serve the purposes of the Act. See
General Counsel memoranda 02–08 and 95–15. This
discretion includes dismissing any charge filed
against an employer that is not covered by the
Board’s jurisdictional requirements.
54032 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations
mstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2
employee rights as well as a remedial
notice. 140 75 FR 80414.
The comments opposing this proposal
make three principal arguments. First,
only Congress, not the Board, has the
authority to ‘‘create a new unfair labor
practice.’’ 141 Second, even if the Board
possesses such authority, it has not
identified the Section 7 rights that
would be interfered with by an
employer’s failure to post the notice. 142
Third, ‘‘interfer[ing] with, restrain[ing],
or coerc[ing]’’ employees within the
meaning of NLRA Section 8(a)(1)
necessarily involves action, not failure
to act; therefore, failure to post the
notice cannot violate Section 8(a)(1). 143
The Board finds no merit in any of these
contentions.
To begin with, it is incorrect to say
that the Board lacks the authority to find
that failure to post the notice violates
Section 8(a)(1) without Congressional
approval. It is true, as the Society for
Human Resource Management states,
that ‘‘Section 10(a) of the Act
specifically limits the NLRB’s powers to
preventing only the unfair labor
practices listed in Section 8 of the Act.
Section 8 is silent regarding any notice
posting requirement (emphasis in
original).’’ However, as the Supreme
Court remarked long ago,
The [NLRA] did not undertake the
impossible task of specifying in precise and
unmistakable language each incident which
would constitute an unfair labor practice. On
the contrary that Act left to the Board the
work of applying the Act’s general
prohibitory language in the light of the
infinite combinations of events which might
be charged as violative of its terms. Thus a
‘‘rigid scheme of remedies’’ is avoided and
administrative flexibility within appropriate
statutory limitations obtained to accomplish
the dominant purpose of the legislation.
Republic Aviation Corporation v. NLRB,
324 U.S. 793, 798 (1945) (citation
omitted). Accordingly, since its
creation, the Board in interpreting
Section 8(a)(1) has found numerous
actions as to which ‘‘Section 8 is
silent’’—e.g., coercively interrogating
employees about their protected
concerted activities, engaging in
140 Consistent with precedent, it will be unlawful
for an employer to threaten or retaliate against an
employee for filing charges or testifying in a Board
proceeding involving an alleged violation of the
notice-posting requirement. NLRA Sections 8(a)(1),

surveillance of employees’ union
activities, threatening employees with
retaliation for engaging in protected
activities—to violate Section 8(a)(1) by
‘‘interfer[ing] with, restrain[ing], or
coerc[ing] employees in the exercise of
the rights guaranteed in section 7’’ of
the NLRA. Section 8 is equally silent
concerning unions’ duty to inform
employees of their rights under NLRB v.
General Motors, above, and
Communications Workers v. Beck,
above, before attempting to obligate
them pursuant to a union-security
clause, yet the Board finds that a
union’s failure to provide that notice
restrains and coerces employees in
violation of Section 8(b)(1)(A).
California Saw & Knife Works, above,
320 NLRB at 233, 259, 261. 144
Because, as described in detail above,
notice posting is necessary to ensure
effective exercise of Section 7 rights, a
refusal to post the required notice is at
least an interference with employees’
exercise of those rights. For these
reasons, in finding that an employer’s
failure to post the required notice
interferes with, restrains, or coerces
employees in the exercise of their NLRA
rights, in violation of Section 8(a)(1), the
Board is acting consistently with its
settled practice. Some comments claim
that the Board has not identified any
specific Section 7 right to justify this
remedy. But such specificity is not
needed, because all Section 7 rights are
implicated by an employer’s failure to
post the required notice. As previously
stated, there is a strong nexus between
knowledge of Section 7 rights and their
free exercise. It therefore follows that an
employer’s failure to post this notice,
which informs employees of their
Section 7 rights, reasonably tends to
interfere with the exercise of such
rights.
Finally, although most violations of
the NLRA involve actions rather than
failures to act, there are instances in
which a failure to act may be found to
interfere with, restrain, or coerce
employees in the exercise of their
Section 7 rights. Thus, a union’s failure
to provide the required notices under
NLRB v. General Motors, above, and
144 See Harkin and Miller. Although the Board
suggested in a footnote in California Saw that there
was no obligation to inform employees of their
Section 7 rights, 320 NLRB at 232 n. 42, this dicta
merely indicated that no such obligation had yet
been recognized in that particular context. To the
extent it could be read as denying that such an
obligation may exist, it is the considered view of the
Board that this reading must be rejected. Similarly,
the statement in U.S. Postal Service, 241 N.L.R.B.
141, 152 (1979), regarding affirmative notice
obligations is limited to Weingarten rights, and, in
any event, does not suggest that notice of NLRA
rights may never be required.

Communications Workers v. Beck,
above, violates Section 8(b)(1)(A) of the
NLRA. California Saw & Knife Works,
above, 320 NLRB at 233, 259, 261. An
employer that fails or refuses to execute
an agreed-to collective-bargaining
agreement on request of the union
violates Section 8(d), 8(a)(5) and,
derivatively, Section 8(a)(1). An
employer that fails to provide relevant
information requested by the union that
represents the employer’s employees
violates Section 8(a)(5) and (1). See, e.g.,
NLRB v. Truitt Mfg. Co., 351 U.S. 149
(1956).
The NLRA’s recognition that a failure
to perform a legal duty may constitute
unlawful interference, coercion or
restraint is not unique. Courts have
expressly held that the failure to post
notice required by regulation can be an
‘‘interference’’ with employee Family
and Medical Leave Act rights. In a
provision that ‘‘largely mimics th[e
language of] § 8(a)(1) of the NLRA,’’
Bachelder v. Am. W. Airlines, 259 F. 3d
1112, 1123 (9th Cir. 2001), the FMLA
states that ‘‘[i]t shall be unlawful for any
employer to interfere with, restrain, or
deny the exercise of or the attempt to
exercise, any right provided under this
title.’’ 29 U.S.C. 2615(a)(1). In
interpreting this language, the
Department of Labor’s regulations
specifically state that failure to post the
required notice of FMLA rights ‘‘may
constitute an interference with,
restraint, or denial of the exercise of an
employee’s FMLA rights’’ under section
2615(a)(1). 29 CFR 825.300(e). Courts
have agreed, finding that the failure to
provide FMLA notices is an ‘‘adverse
action’’ against the employee that
supports a prima facie case of
interference. Greenwell v. Charles
Machine Works, Inc., (W.D. Ok. April
15, 2011); Smith v. Westchester County,
(S.D.N.Y. February 14, 2011).
Accordingly, the Board finds no
impediment to declaring that an
employer’s failure to post the required
notice will violate Section 8(a)(1). 145
As it explained in the NPRM,
however, the Board expects that, in
practice, few violations will be found
for failures to post the notice. The Board
anticipates that most employers that fail
to post the notice will do so because
they are unaware of the rule, and that
when they learn about the rule, they
will post the notice without the need for
formal administrative action or
litigation. 75 FR 80414. To that end,
§ 104.212(a) of the rule states that if an
145 ALFA contends that failure to post a Boardrequired
notice is not an unfair labor practice, but
the authorities cited do not support that
proposition.
Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations
54033

unfair labor practice charge is filed
alleging failure to post the notice, ‘‘the
Regional Director will make reasonable
efforts to persuade the respondent
employer to post the * * * notice
expeditiously,’’ and that ‘‘[i]f the
employer does so, the Board expects
that there will rarely be a need for
further administrative proceedings.’’ 75
FR 80419.
Numerous comments assert that
finding the failure to post the notice to
be an unfair labor practice is too harsh
a remedy, especially for small
employers that are more likely to be
excusably unaware of the rule. 146 As
just stated, in practice it should almost
never be necessary for proceedings to
reach that point. For the few employers
that may ultimately be found to have
violated Section 8(a)(1) by failing to post
the notice of employee rights, the only
certain consequences will be an order to
cease and desist and that the notice and
a remedial notice be posted; those
remedies do not strike the Board as
severe.
Michigan Health & Hospital
Association urges that an employer be
allowed to correct an initial failure to
post the notice without further
consequences; Fireside Distributors, Inc.
agrees and asks that technical violations
of the rule not be subject to a finding of
a violation. The Heritage Foundation
backs the same approach for inadvertent
failures to post. The Board disagrees. To
repeat, the Board anticipates that most
employers that inadvertently fail to post
the notice will do so on being informed
of the posting requirement, and that in
those circumstances further proceedings
will rarely be required. However, the
Board believes that this matter is best
handled through the General Counsel’s
traditional exercise of prosecutorial
discretion in accordance with the
directions given here.
California Chamber and NCAE
contend that the Board should specify
the ‘‘reasonable efforts’’ a Regional
Director will make to persuade an
employer to post the notice when a
charge alleging a failure to post has been
filed. They propose that the rule be
amended to state that the Board will
send the employer at least two mailed
letters, with the notice enclosed,
requesting that the employer post the
notice within a specified period of time,
preferably 30 days. They also assert that
the Board must specify the
circumstances in which additional
proceedings will be appropriate. The
Heritage Foundation urges that
§ 104.212(a) be modified to state that if
146 See, e.g., comments of St Mar Enterprises, Inc.
and National Federation of Independent Business.
an employer promptly posts the notice,
‘‘there will be no further administrative
proceedings, unless the Board has
information giving the Board reason to
believe that the preceding failure to do
so was intentional.’’ The Board rejects
these suggestions because they would
create unnecessary obstacles to effective
enforcement of the notice requirement.
That requirement is straightforward, and
compliance should be a simple matter.
The Board believes that the General
Counsel should have discretion to
address particular cases of noncompliance
efficiently and
appropriately, depending upon the
circumstances.
B. Tolling the Section 10(b) Statute of
Limitations
NLRA Section 10(b) provides in part
that ‘‘no complaint shall issue based
upon any unfair labor practice occurring
more than six months prior to the filing
of the charge with the Board[.]’’ 29
U.S.C. 160(b). However, as the Board
stated in the NPRM, the 6-month filing
period does not begin to run until the
charging party has actual or constructive
notice of the allegedly unlawful
conduct. See, e.g., John Morrell & Co.,
304 NLRB 896, 899 (1991), review
denied 998 F.2d 7 (D.C. Cir. 1993)
(table). 75 FR 80414. This makes
intuitive sense, because it would be
unfair to expect charges to be filed
before the charging party could
reasonably have known that the law was
violated. Similar concerns for fairness
justify tolling the statute of limitations
where an employee, although aware of
the conduct in question, is excusably
unaware that the conduct is unlawful
because mandatory notice was not given
to the employee. The Board found that
widespread ignorance of NLRA rights
justified requiring notice to be posted.
The Board cited the observation of the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit in a case involving the failure to
post the notice required under the
ADEA, that ‘‘[t]he [ADEA] posting
requirement was undoubtedly created
because Congress recognized that the
very persons protected by the Act might
be unaware of its existence.’’ Bonham v.
Dresser Industries, 569 F.2d 187, 193
(1977), cert. denied 439 U.S. 821 (1978).
Accordingly, the Board proposed that
tolling the 10(b) period for filing unfair
labor practice charges might be
appropriate where the required notice
has not been posted. 75 FR 80414. For
the reasons discussed below, the Board
adheres to that view.
Section 10(b) is a statute of
limitations, and statutes of limitations
are presumed to include equitable
tolling whenever the statute is silent or
VerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00029 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2
ambiguous on the issue. Irwin v. Dep’t
Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 94–96
(1990); Zipes v. Trans World Airlines,
Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 392–98 (1982); see
Young v. United States, 535 U.S. 43, 49
(2002) (‘‘It is hornbook law that
limitations periods are customarily
subject to equitable tolling, unless
tolling would be inconsistent with the
text of the relevant statute.’’ (quotations
and citations omitted)); Hallstrom v.
Tillamook County, 493 U.S. 20, 27
(1989) (‘‘The running of such statutes is
traditionally subject to equitable
tolling.’’); Honda v. Clark, 386 U.S. 484,
501 (1967); Glus v. Brooklyn E.D.
Terminal, 359 U.S. 231, 232–33 (1959)
(equitable tolling of statutes of
limitations is ‘‘[d]eeply rooted in our
jurisprudence’’); Holmberg v.
Armbrecht, 327 U.S. 392, 396–97 (1946)
(equitable tolling is ‘‘read into every
federal statute of limitation’’).
In Zipes, the Supreme Court held that
the timeliness provision of Title VII’s
charge-filing requirement was ‘‘subject
to waiver, estoppel and equitable
tolling.’’ 455 U.S. at 392–98. The
Supreme Court expressly analogized to
the NLRA, and stated that Section10(b)
was not jurisdictional: ‘‘[T]he time
requirement for filing an unfair labor
practice charge under the National
Labor Relations Act operates as a statute
of limitations subject to recognized
equitable doctrines and not as a
restriction of the jurisdiction of the
National Labor Relations Board.’’ Id. at
n.11. Zipes strongly supports the
proposed rule. The analogy between
Title VII and the NLRA is well
established, and neither the holding of
Zipes regarding Title VII nor Zipes’
characterization of 10(b) has ever been
called into doubt.
Notices of employment rights are
intended, in part, to advise employees
of the kinds of conduct that may violate
their rights so that they may seek
appropriate remedies when violations
occur. Failure to post required notices
deprives employees of both the
knowledge of their rights and of the
availability of avenues of redress.
Accordingly, a substantial majority of
the courts of appeals—including the
First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth,
Seventh, Eighth, and Eleventh
Circuits—have adopted the doctrine that
the failure to post required employment
law notices may result in equitable
tolling of the statute of limitations.

time within which a claimant must file
his or her discrimination charge.’’))
After careful consideration, the Board
is persuaded that the prevailing judicial
view should apply in the NLRA context
as well. 148 As an equitable concept,
equitable tolling is a matter of fairness.
The Board has determined that many
employees are unaware of their NLRA
rights and has devised a minimally
burdensome means of attempting to
rectify that situation—requiring
employers to post workplace notices
informing employees of those rights. To
bar an employee who is excusably
unaware of the NLRA from seeking a
remedy for a violation of NLRA rights
because he or she failed to file an unfair
labor practice charge within the 10(b)
period, when the employer did not post
the required notice, would unfairly
deprive the employee of the protection
of the Act because of the employer’s
failure to comply with its legal
responsibilities. To deny equitable
tolling in such circumstances ‘‘would
grant to the employee a right to be
informed without redress for violation.’’
Bonham v. Dresser Industries, above,
569 F.2d at 193. 149
147 See comments of Harkin and Miller, AFL–CIO,
and Service Employees International Union (SEIU).
148 The Board has broad discretion to interpret
10(b), including equitable tolling, in accordance
with its experience administering the Act. Lodge 64,
IAM v. NLRB, 949 F.2d 441, 444 (D.C. Cir. 1991)
(deferring to the Board’s interpretation of 10(b)
equitable exceptions).
149 Under the final rule, the Board could also find
the failure to post the notice to be an unfair labor
practice, and could, if appropriate, consider a
willful failure to post to be evidence of unlawful
motive in an unfair labor practice case. However,
The Board received many comments
opposing this proposed rule provision.
Several comments assert that, when a
charging party is unaware of the facts
supporting the finding of an unfair labor
practice, the Board tolls the 10(b) period
only when the charged party has
fraudulently concealed those facts from
the charging party. 150 That is not so.
The Board has long held, with court
approval, that the 10(b) period begins to
run only when the charging party has
notice that the NLRA has been violated.
The party asserting the 10(b) defense
has the burden to show such notice; it
may do so by showing that the charging
party had either actual or constructive
knowledge of the alleged unfair labor
practice prior to the 10(b) period. See,
e.g., Broadway Volkswagen, 342 NLRB
1244, 1246 (2004), enfd. sub nom. East
Bay Automotive Council v. NLRB, 483

1978), cert. denied 440 U.S. 940 (1979).
Knowledge may be imputed if the
charging party would have discovered
the unlawful conduct by exercising
reasonable or due diligence. Broadway
Volkswagen, above, 342 NLRB at 1246.
Certainly, the Board has found it
appropriate to toll the 10(b) period
when the charging party was excusably
unaware of the pertinent facts because
the charged party had fraudulently
concealed them; see, e.g., Burgess
Construction, above, 227 NLRB at 766;
but tolling is not limited to such
circumstances. Pullman Building
Company, above, 251 NLRB at 1048.
To the extent that the comments argue
that the Board should not engage in
equitable tolling of the 10(b) period
when an employer has merely failed to
post the notice but not engaged in
fraudulent concealment, 151 the Board
disagrees. Fraudulent concealment
concerns a different kind of equitable
doctrine, and is not directly relevant to
the notice posting equitable tolling
doctrine hereby adopted. See Mercado,
above, 410 F.3d at 46–47 n.8 (employer
misconduct and equitable tolling
in the absence of equitable tolling of the 10(b)
period, such ‘‘redress’’ would not aid an employee
who was excusably unaware of his or her NLRA
rights, failed to file a timely charge, and thus was
denied any remedy for violation of those rights. Cf.
Kanakis Co., 293 NLRB 435, 436 fn. 10 (1989)
(possibility of criminal sanctions against employer
would be little comfort to charging party if deprived
of recourse to Board’s remedial processes).

doctrine form ‘‘two distinct lines of
cases apply[ing] two distinct standards
to two distinct bases for equitable
tolling’’).
Some comments argue that because
Section 10(b) contains a limited
exception to the 6-month filing period
for employees in the military, it is
improper for the Board to toll the 10(b)
period under other circumstances. 152
The Board rejects this argument as
foreclosed by the Supreme Court’s
holding in Zipes, above, and by the long
line of Board and court decisions
finding tolling of the 10(b) period
appropriate. In any event, the exception
in Section 10(b) for persons in the
military provides that if the aggrieved
person ‘‘was prevented from filing such
charge by reason of service in the armed
forces, in which event the six-month
period shall be computed from the day
of his discharge.’’ This provision does
not toll the six-month period during
armed service; rather, it states that the
six-month period begins at discharge.
See Holland v. Florida, 130 S.Ct. 2549,
2561 (2010) (rejecting argument that
explicit exceptions to time limits in
nonjurisdictional statute of limitations
precluded equitable tolling). 153
A number of comments contend that
tolling the 10(b) period is contrary to the
salutary purpose of statutes of
limitations in general, and 10(b) in
particular, which is ‘‘to require diligent
prosecution of known claims, thereby
providing finality and predictability in
legal affairs and ensuring that claims
will be resolved while evidence is
reasonably available and fresh.’’ 154
Black’s Law Dictionary, 9th Edition, at
1546. The Board recognizes that with
the passage of time evidence can be lost
and witnesses die, move away, or their
memories fade; it therefore will not
lightly find that the 10(b) period should
be tolled. However, like the courts
whose decisions are cited above, the
Board also recognizes that equitable
tolling is a fundamental part of the
statute of limitations, and that inequity
results from barring an individual from
seeking relief from a violation of his or
her NLRA rights where the individual
excusably was unaware of these rights.
After all, the purpose of a statute of
limitations is to ‘‘require diligent
152 See, e.g., comments of California Chamber and
NCAE.
153 American Bus Association v. Slater, 231 F. 3d
1 (D.C. Cir. 2000), cited by California Chamber and
NCAE, did not concern equitable tolling and is
therefore inapposite. The court there also found that
Congress had expressly limited the sanctions
available under the Americans with Disabilities Act
to those enumerated in that statute; such is not the
case under the NLRA.
154 See, e.g., comments of FMI, COLLE, and U.S.
Chamber of Commerce.

prosecution of known claims,’’ not
claims that are unknown to the injured
party. As to concerns that the statute of
limitations could be tolled for years,
‘‘perhaps indefinitely,’’ 155 the Board
responds that such a potential also
exists under other statutes, as well as
under the NLRA when a charging party
is unaware of the facts giving rise to an
alleged unfair labor practice. However,
at this point, concerns about the
unfairness of lengthy tolling periods are
entirely speculative. Tolling is an
equitable matter, and one factor to be
considered in deciding whether
equitable tolling is appropriate is
whether it would prejudice the
respondent. Mercado, above, 410 F.3d at
48. Accordingly, if a lengthy tolling of
the 10(b) period would prejudice an
employer in a given case, the Board
could properly consider that factor in
determining whether tolling was
appropriate in that case. 156
Several comments argue against
tolling the 10(b) period because
‘‘ignorance of the law is no excuse.’’ 157
This argument is amply refuted by the
court decisions cited above, in which
limitations periods under other
workplace statutes were tolled because
employers failed to post required
notices. Most notably, the Fifth Circuit
has emphasized that the failure to post
a required notice ‘‘vitiates the normal
assumption that an employee is aware
of his rights.’’ Elliot v. Group Med. &
Surgical Serv., 714 F.2d 556, 563–64
(5th Cir. 1983). In any event, the maxim
relied on is generally understood to
have arisen in order to prevent
individuals (usually in criminal cases)
from deliberately failing to ascertain
whether actions they contemplate taking
would be lawful, and then pleading
ignorance when accused of
lawbreaking. 158 In the Board’s view, this
reasoning loses much of its force when
applied to individuals, such as charging
parties in unfair labor practice cases,
who are not accused of any wrongdoing
but who claim to have been injured by
the unlawful actions of other parties.
The Board emphasizes, however, that
failure to post the required notice will
not automatically warrant a tolling
remedy. If an employer proves that an
155 See comments of Fisher & Phillips LLC and
National Grocers Association.
156 As to ACC’s concern that the rule could
potentially subject employers to unfair labor
practice charges based on conduct as far back as
1935, the Board stresses that tolling will be
available only in the case of unlawful conduct that
occurs after the rule takes effect.
157 See, e.g., comments of Coalition for a
Democratic Workplace and COLLE.
158 Moreover, even in criminal law, the principle
is not absolute. See, e.g., Lambert v. California, 355
U.S. 225 (1957).
employee had actual or constructive
knowledge of the conduct alleged to be
unlawful, as well as actual or
constructive knowledge that the
conduct violated the NLRA, and yet
failed to timely file an unfair labor
practice charge, the Board will not toll
the 10(b) period merely because of the
employer’s failure to post the notice. Cf.
John Morrell & Co., above, 304 NLRB at
899.
The Board asked for comments
concerning whether unions filing unfair
labor practice charges should be deemed
to have constructive knowledge of the
unlawful character of the conduct at
issue. All of the comments that
addressed this issue answered in the
affirmative. 159 Unlike most employees,
unions routinely deal with issues
arising under the NLRA and are
therefore more familiar with the Act’s
provisions. Accordingly, the tolling
provisions in the final rule apply only
to charges filed by employees, not those
filed by unions. (The Board still could
toll the 10(b) period if a charging party
union did not discover the facts
underlying the charge within six
months, if the employees reporting
those events failed to alert the union
within that time because they were
excusably unaware of their NLRA
rights.)
Several comments contend that
failure to post the required notice
should not toll the 10(b) period if an
employee who files an unfair labor
practice charge is either a union
member or is represented by a union.
Taft Stettinius & Hollister LLP asserts
that the burden should be placed
equally on unions to ensure that their
organizers and members are aware of
employee rights under the NLRA.
California Chamber and NCAE observe
that knowledge of a filing time limit is
generally imputed to an individual who
is represented by an attorney, see, e.g.,
Mercado v. Ritz-Carlton San Juan Hotel,
above, 410 F.3d at 47–48; they urge that
an employee who is represented by a
union should be treated similarly.
Conversely, three Georgetown
University law students oppose the idea
that union-represented employees
should be deemed to have constructive
knowledge of NLRA rights. They reason
that some workplaces may have
unrepresented as well as represented
employees, and that imputing
knowledge to the latter group would
provide an incentive not to post the
notice, thus depriving the former group
of needed information. The students

also suggest that some employees,
though represented, may have little
contact with their unions and rely on
workplace notices instead of unions for
relevant information.
The Board finds some merit in both
sets of contentions. On the one hand, it
is reasonable to assume that employees
who are represented by unions are more
likely to be aware of their NLRA rights
than unrepresented employees. And,
although being represented by a union
is not the same as being represented by
legal counsel, it is reasonable to assume
that union officials are sufficiently
conversant with the NLRA to be able to
give employees effective advice as to
their NLRA rights. On the other hand,
some employees, though represented by
unions, may in fact have little contact
with their bargaining representatives for
one reason or other and may, in fact, be
filing charges against their
representative. Thus, the Board does not
find it appropriate under all
circumstances to impute knowledge of
NLRA rights to charge-filing employees
who are union members or are
represented by unions. Rather, the
Board will consider evidence
concerning the union’s representational
presence and activity in determining
whether it is appropriate to toll the
10(b) period.
C. Failure To Post as Evidence of
Unlawful Motive
The Board suggested that it could
consider an employer’s knowing failure
to post the notice as evidence of
unlawful motive in an unfair labor
practice proceeding in which motive is
an issue. 75 FR 80414–80415. A number
of comments assert that the Board
cannot properly take that step. 160 To the
contrary, the Board has often considered
other unlawful conduct as evidence of
antiunion animus in cases in which
unlawful motive was an element of an
unfair labor practice. 161 See, e.g., Leiser
Construction, LLC, 349 NLRB 413, 417–
419 (2007) (threats, coercive statements,
interrogations evidence of unlawfully
motivated failure to hire), enfd. 281 Fed.

discharge); Ferguson-Williams, Inc., 322

interrogations, creation of impression of
surveillance, evidence of unlawfully
motivated discharge); Champion Rivet
Co., 314 NLRB 1097, 1098 (1994)

refusal to recognize and bargain with
union, evidence of unlawfully
motivated failure to hire). Thus, it is
proper for the Board to consider a
knowing and willful failure to post the
notice as evidence of unlawful motive.
However, the Board has noticed that
it employed somewhat inconsistent
language in the NPRM regarding the
consideration of failure to post the
notice as evidence of antiunion animus.
Thus, the caption of paragraph
104.214(b) reads: ‘‘Knowing
noncompliance as evidence of unlawful
motive.’’ However, the paragraph itself
states that ‘‘If an employer has actual or
constructive knowledge of the
requirement to post the notice and fails
or refuses to do so, the Board may
consider such a willful refusal as
evidence of unlawful motive in a case
in which motive is an issue.’’ (Emphasis
added in both cases.) 75 FR at 80420. In
the preamble to the NPRM, the Board
referred only to knowing noncompliance
as evidence of unlawful motive. 75 FR
at 80414–80415. On reflection, the
Board wishes to clarify this provision to
state that, to be considered as evidence
of unlawful motive, an employer’s
failure to post the notice must be both
knowing and willful—i.e., the employer
must have actual (as opposed to
constructive) knowledge of the rule and
yet refuse, on no cognizable basis, to
post the notice. The Board is revising
the language of the rule accordingly.
The comment that prompted these
revisions urges that there should be no
adverse consequences for the employer
that does not post the notice because it
has a good-faith (but, implicitly,
erroneous) belief that it is not covered
by the NLRA. 162 The Board rejects this
contention as it pertains to finding the
failure to post to be an unfair labor
practice or grounds for tolling the 10(b)
period. Failure to post the notice
interferes with employees’ NLRA rights
regardless of the reason for the failure;
good faith, though commendable, is
irrelevant. 163 Additionally, tolling is
162 One example could be an employer that
believes that it is subject to the Railway Labor Act
and not to the NLRA.
163 This is so in other areas of NLRA law. For
example, an employer who coercively interrogates
or disciplines an individual concerning his or her
union activities violates the NLRA if the individual
is a statutory employee, even though the employer
may have honestly believed that the individual was
a statutory supervisor and not protected by the
NLRA. Also, absent compelling economic
circumstances, an employer that is testing the
Board’s certification of a newly-selected union in
the court of appeals makes unilateral changes in
unit employees’ terms and conditions of
employment at its peril; if the court affirms the
certification, the unilateral changes violate NLRA
Section 8(a)(5) even if the employer believed in
good faith that the certification was inappropriate.
concerned with fairness to the
employee, and these fairness concerns
are unaffected by the employer’s good or
bad faith; as previously noted, notice
posting tolling is fundamentally
different from tolling based upon
employer misconduct. However, an
employer that fails to post the notice
only because it honestly but erroneously
believes that it is not subject to the
NLRB’s jurisdiction does not thereby
indicate that it is hostile to employees’
NLRA rights, but only that it believes
that those rights do not apply in the
employer’s workplace. In such a case,
the employer’s good faith normally
should preclude finding the failure to
post to be willful or evidence of
antiunion animus.
ACC contends that even though the
rule states that only a ‘‘willful’’ failure
to post the notice may be considered
evidence of unlawful motive, in practice
the Board will always infer at least
constructive notice from the publication
of the rule in the Federal Register and
the maxim that ‘‘ignorance of the law is
no excuse.’’ 164 The Board rejects this
contention. The quoted maxim means
only that an employer’s actual lack of
knowledge of the rule would not excuse
its failure to post the notice. It would,
however, undercut any suggestion that
the failure to post was willful and
therefore indicative of unlawful motive.
Contrary to numerous comments, 165
finding a willful failure to post the
notice as evidence of animus is not the
same as adopting a ‘‘presumption of
animus’’ or ‘‘presumption of unlawful
motive.’’ There is no such presumption.
The Board’s general counsel would have
the burden of proving that a failure to
post was willful. In any event, a willful
failure to post would not be conclusive
proof of unlawful motive, but merely
evidence that could be considered,
along with other evidence, in
determining whether the general
counsel had demonstrated unlawful
motive. 166 Likewise, contrary to the
contentions of ALFA and AHCA, the
Board will not assume that any failure

Association (AHCA).

166 The Georgetown law students ask whether, if
failure to post the notice may be found to be an
unfair labor practice and also may be considered
evidence of antiunion animus, such a failure could
‘‘satisfy an element of its own violation.’’ The
answer is no, because the failure to post, whether
knowing or inadvertent, would be an unfair labor
practice regardless of motive; knowing and willful
failure to post would be relevant only in cases such
as those alleging unlawful discipline, discharge, or
refusal to hire, in which motive is an element of the
violation.
to post the notice is intentional and
meant to prevent employees of learning
their rights.
D. Other Comments
VerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2
The Board received many comments
asserting that if the proposed
enforcement scheme for failure to post
the required notice is adopted, union
adherents will tear down the notices in
order to harass employers and,
particularly, to vitiate 10(b). 167 These
comments express the concern that
tolling the 10(b) period will lead to a
flood of unfair labor practice charges,
and that, to avoid that eventuality,
employers will have to incur significant
costs of policing the postings and/or
installing expensive tamper-proof
bulletin boards. 168 In the absence of
experience with such postings, the
Board deems these concerns speculative
at this time. If particular employers
experience such difficulties, the Board
will deal with them on a case-by-case
basis. However, as explained above,
tolling is an equitable matter, and if an
employer has posted the notice and
taken reasonable steps to insure that it
remains posted, it is unlikely that the
Board would find tolling appropriate.
California Chamber and NCAE ask the
Board to specify the ‘‘additional
remedies’’ that may be imposed in the
event of a notice posting violation.
104.213(a). The Board has broad
discretion in crafting remedies for
violations of the NLRA. NLRB v. Seven-
Up Bottling Co. of Miami, 344 U.S. 344,
346 (1953). The remedies imposed in a
given case depend on the nature of the
violations and the particular facts in the
case. The Board declines to speculate as
to every possible remedy that might be
imposed in every imaginable set of
circumstances.
Several comments protest that
employers could be fined for failing to
post the notice; several others contend
that the Board should levy fines instead
of imposing the proposed remedies. The
167 See, e.g., comments of Lemon Grove Care &
Rehabilitation, numerous ‘‘postcard’’ comments.
168 One comment asserts that because of the
potential for tolling the 10(b) period, ‘‘businesses
* * * will have to keep records forever[.]’’ The
Board finds no merit in this contention. Employers
that are aware of the rule can avoid keeping records
‘‘forever’’ simply by posting the notice. Employers
that are not aware of the requirement to post the
notice would also be unaware of the possibility of
tolling the 10(b) period in the event of a failure to
post, and thus would discern no reason to—and
probably would not—keep records ‘‘forever.’’
Prejudice to the employer because of long-lost
records would be considered by the Board in
determining whether tolling is appropriate in the
particular case.
Another comment complains that ‘‘the
requirement of proof on the employer to ‘certify’
that this posting is up each day is burdensome[.]’’
There is no such requirement.

Board rejects both contentions because,
as explained in the NPRM, the Board
does not have the authority to impose
fines. 75 FR 80414, citing Republic Steel
Corp. v. NLRB, 311 U.S. 7, 10–12 (1940).
Another comment argues that the Board
should not provide remedies for failing
to post the notice because such
remedies are not provided under other
statutes. In fact, both remedies and
sanctions are imposed under some
statutes; see, e.g., 29 CFR 1601.30 (fine
of $110 per offense for failing to post
notice under Title VII); 29 CFR
825.300(a)(1) (same sanction for failing
to post notice under FMLA); cases cited
above for tolling of limitation periods
for failing to post notices under several
statutes.
One comment contends that the
proposed remedies were proposed
solely as means of deterring failures to
post the notices, and are therefore
inappropriate; several other comments
assert that the proposed remedies are
punitive. 169 Although the Board
disagrees, there is language in the
NPRM that may have inadvertently
suggested that the enforcement
mechanisms were proposed solely for
deterrent purposes. The Board wishes to
correct any such misimpression. As
stated above, in explaining why it was
proposing those mechanisms, the Board
stated in its NPRM that it was ‘‘mindful
of the need to identify effective
incentives for compliance.’’ 75 FR
80413. Later, referring to tolling the
10(b) period and considering a willful
failure to post the notice as evidence of
unlawful motive, the Board said that it
‘‘proposes the following options
intended to induce compliance with the
notice-posting requirement.’’ Id. at
80414. However, the Board made those
statements while explaining why it had
determined not to rely entirely on
employers’ voluntary compliance with
the rule. (The Board had had little
success in persuading employers to
voluntarily post notices of employee
rights during the critical period leading
up to a representation election.) Id. By
noting that the proposed enforcement
scheme would have some deterrent
effect in that context, the Board did not
mean to imply that it was proposing
those measures solely for deterrence
purposes. For the reasons discussed at
length above, the Board has found that
finding a failure to post the notices to
violate Section 8(a)(1) and, in
appropriate circumstances, to warrant
tolling the 10(b) period and/or inferring
unlawful motive in an unfair labor
practice case are legitimate remedial
169 See, e.g., comments of FMI, ALFA, AHCA.
measures supported by extensive Board
and court precedent.
In addition, in a number of places the
NPRM used the term ‘‘sanctions’’ in a
very loose sense to refer to aspects of the
proposed enforcement scheme,
inadvertently suggesting that this
scheme was punitive. The term
‘‘sanctions’’ was an inapt choice of
descriptor for the enforcement scheme:
the classic 8(a)(1) remedial order has
long been upheld as nonpunitive;
equitable tolling is concerned with
fairness to employees, not punishment
of misconduct, and is fully consistent
with current Board doctrine; and the
animus provision is little more than the
common-sense extension of wellestablished
evidentiary principles that
apply to many other NLRA violations,
and is also not designed to punish
employers. That they may also furnish
incentives for employers to comply with
the notice-posting rule does not detract
from their legitimacy; if it were
otherwise, the Board could never
impose any remedy for violations of the
NLRA if the remedy had a deterrent
effect. In any event, the Board hereby
disavows any suggestion from
statements in the NPRM that the
remedial measures were proposed solely
as penalties.
Contrary to the tenor of numerous
comments opposing this rule, 170 the
Board is not issuing the rule in order to
entrap unwary employers and make
operations more difficult for them
because of inadvertent or technical
violations. It is doing so in order that
employees may come to understand
their NLRA rights through exposure to
notices posted in their workplaces
explaining those rights. Accordingly,
the important thing is that the notices be
posted. As explained above, an
employer that fails to post the notice
because it is unaware of the rule, but
promptly posts the notice when the rule
is brought to its attention, will nearly
always avoid any further proceedings.
Similarly, an employer that posts the
notice but fails initially to comply with
one of the technical posting
requirements will almost always avoid
further problems by correcting the error
when it is called to the employer’s
attention. And if an employer is unsure
of what the rule requires in a particular
setting, it can seek and receive guidance
from the Board.
The Service Employees International
Union and the United Food and
Commercial Workers propose that, in
170 For example, ‘‘This seems to be yet another
trap for the employers. Another avenue to subject
them to law suits and interrogations, and
uneconomic activities and ungodly expenditures.’’

addition to the proposed enforcement
scheme, the rule state that an
employer’s knowing failure to post the
notice of employee rights during the
critical period before a representation
election shall be grounds for setting the
election aside on the filing of proper
objections. The Board finds that this is
unnecessary, because the Board’s notice
of election, which must be posted by an
employer three working days before an
election takes place, contains a
summary of employee NLRA rights and
a list of several kinds of unfair labor
practices, and failure to post that notice
already constitutes grounds for setting
an election aside. 171 In any event,
during a union organizing campaign, the
union can instruct members of its inplant
organizing committee to verify
whether the notice required under this
rule has been posted; if it has not, the
union can so inform the employer and,
if need be, the Board’s regional office.
Subpart C—Ancillary Matters
Several technical issues unrelated to
those discussed in the two previous
subparts are set out in this subpart.
IV. Dissenting View of Member Brian E.
Hayes
‘‘Agencies may play the sorcerer’s
apprentice but not the sorcerer
himself.’’ 172
Today, my colleagues conjure up a
new unfair labor practice based on a
new statutory obligation. They impose
on as many as six million private
employers the obligation to post a notice
of employee rights and selected
illustrative unfair labor practices. The
obligation to post is deemed enforceable
through Section 8(a)(1)’s proscription of
interference with employees’ Section 7
rights, and the failure to post is further
penalized by equitable tolling of Section
10(b)’s limitations period and the
possible inference of discriminatory
motivation for adverse employment
actions taken in the absence of posting.
While the need for a more informed
constituency might be a desirable goal,
it is attainable only with Congressional
imprimatur. The Board’s rulemaking
authority, broad as it is, does not
encompass the authority to promulgate
a rule of this kind. Even if it did, the
action taken here is arbitrary and
capricious, and therefore invalid,
because it is not based on substantial
evidence and it lacks a reasoned
analysis.

Regulations.

No Statutory Authority for the Proposed
Rule
The majority concedes that the
‘‘National Labor Relations Act does not
directly address an employer’s
obligation to post a notice of its
employees’ rights arising under the Act
or the consequences an employer may
face for failing to do so.’’ In fact, the
NLRA 173 makes no mention of any such
putative obligation. The majority further
acknowledges that the NLRA ‘‘is almost
unique among major Federal labor laws
in not including an express statutory
provision requiring employers routinely
to post notices at their workplaces
informing employees of their statutory
rights.’’ Despite the obvious import of
these admissions, the majority
concludes that the Board’s plenary
authority under Section 6 of the Act to
make rules ‘‘necessary to carry out the
provisions of the Act’’ permits
promulgation of the rule they advocate.
I disagree.
Congress did not give specific
statutory authority to the Board to
require the posting of a general rights
notice when it passed the Wagner Act
in 1935. Just one year earlier, however,
Congress amended the Railway Labor
Act (‘‘RLA’’) to include an express
notice-posting requirement. 45 U.S.C.
152 Eighth; Pub. L. No. 73–442, 48 Stat.
1185, 1188 (1934). As the Supreme
Court noted, the RLA served as the
model for the National Labor Relations
Act. NLRB v. Pennsylvania Greyhound
Lines, 303 U.S. 261 (1938). See also
NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp.,
301 U.S. 1, 44 (1937); H. J. Heinz Co. v.
NLRB, 311 U.S. 514, 524–525(1941).
That Congress did not include an
express notice-posting requirement
when passing the Wagner Act the
following year strongly implies, if not
compels, the conclusion that Congress
did not intend for the Board to have
regulatory authority to require such a
notice. Nothing in the legislative history
hints of any concern by Congress about
the need for employers to notify
employees generally of their rights
under the new enacting statute. Since
1935, despite extensive revisions in the
Taft-Hartley Act amendments of 1947
and the Landrum-Griffin Act
amendments of 1959, Congress has
never added such authority.
On the other hand, when Congress
has subsequently desired to include a
general rights notice-posting
requirement, it has done so expressly in
other federal labor and employment
173 Throughout this dissent, I will refer generally
to the statute we administer as the NLRA, unless
the discussion focuses on a specific historical
version, such as the Wagner Act.
laws. See Title VII of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 (Title VII), 42 U.S.C.
2000e–10, the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. 627,
The Occupational Safety and Health
Act, 29 U.S.C. 657(c), the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C.
12115, the Family and Medical Leave
Act (FMLA), 29 U.S.C. 2619(a), and the
Uniformed Service Employment and
Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA),
38 U.S.C. 4334(a).
The majority points out that the
Department of Labor (DOL) promulgated
a notice-posting rule under the Fair
Labor Standards Act (FLSA), although
that statute does not contain a specific
statutory provision on workplace
postings. However, the FLSA, unlike the
NLRA, imposes a data-collection and
recordkeeping requirement on
employers. 29 U.S.C. 211(c). DOL’s
Wage and Hour Administrator
promulgated the notice-posting
regulation in 1949 in reliance on this
requirement. It appears that the
propriety of the FLSA rule has never
been challenged, perhaps because,
unlike the rule promulgated herein,
there are no citations or penalties
assessed for the failure to post. This is
a significant point of distinction that
warrants further discussion.
It must be constantly borne in mind
that the rule promulgated today makes
the failure to post the required notice a
violation of the Act. The majority
misleadingly seeks to decouple
obligation from violation in its analysis
by discussing the latter in the context of
enforcement of the assertedly lawful
notice-posting rule. That is nonsense.
Making noncompliance an unfair labor
practice is integral to the rule and,
consequently, integral to an analysis of
whether the notice-posting requirement
is a permissible exercise of the Board’s
rulemaking authority. Of the
aforementioned agencies that have
notice-posting requirements, none of
them makes the failure to post unlawful,
absent additional specific statutory
authorization. Only the RLA, Title VII,
FMLA, and the Occupational Safety Act
(OSHA) have such authorizing language.
ADA, the ADEA, the FLSA, and the
USERRA do not. Consequently, an
employer’s failure to post a notice under
those statutes is not subject to sanction
as unlawful.
Thus, both before and after the
Wagner Act, Congress has consistently
manifested by express statutory
language its intent to impose a general
notice-posting duty on employers with
respect to the rights of employees under
various federal labor laws. Only one
administrative agency promulgated a
notice-posting requirement in the
VerDate Mar<15>2010 18:19 Aug 29, 2011 Jkt 223001 PO 00000 Frm 00034 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\30AUR2.SGM 30AUR2
absence of such language in its enabling
statute. No agency has made the failure
to comply with a notice-posting
requirement unlawful absent express
statutory authorization, until today.
The explicit inclusion of noticeposting
provisions and permissible
sanctions by Congress in other labor
legislation undercuts the majority’s
claim that this notice-posting rule is not
a ‘‘major policy decision properly made
by Congress alone.’’ Strangely, the
majority does not merely contend that
this pattern in comparable labor
legislation fails to prove that Congress
did not intend that the Board should
have the rulemaking authority under
Section 6 to mandate the notice posting
at issue here. They conversely contend
that it proves Congress must have
intended to confer such authority on the
Board! 174
Perhaps cognizant of the weakness of
this position, the majority attempts to
downplay the import of Congressional
silence on the Board’s authority to
mandate notice posting and to enforce
that mandate through unfair labor
practice sanctions. They cite Cheney
R.R. Co. v. ICC, 902 F. 2d 66, 68–69
(D.C. Cir. 1990), for the proposition that
the maxim ‘‘expressio unius est exclusio
alterius,’’ which holds that the special
mention of one thing indicates an intent
for another thing not be included
elsewhere, may not always be a useful
tool for interpreting the intent of
Congress. Obviously, the usefulness of
this tool depends on the context of a
particular statute. Independent Ins.
Agents of Am., Inc. v. Hawke, 211 F.3d
638 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (applying the
maxim). In my view, the absence of an
express notice provision in the NLRA,
and the failure to amend the Act to
include one when Congress expressly
included notice posting provisions in
other labor statutes, shows that it did
not intend to authorize the Board to
promulgate this rule. 175
Arguing to the contrary, the majority
asserts that the notice-posting rule is
174 Of course, this reasoning would seem to
dictate that the failure of the Board to inform its
own employees of their general rights under the
Federal Labor Relations Act is an unfair labor
practice, even though that statute imposes no such
express requirement. To date, I am not aware that
this agency, or any other, views itself as subject to
such an enforceable obligation.
175 The majority contends that the fact that the
rule comes 76 years after the NLRA was enacted is
not a ‘‘condition of validity.’’ Mayo Foundation for
Medical Education and Research v. United States,
131 S.Ct. 704, 713–14 (2011) (quoting Smiley v.
Citibank (S.D.), N.A., 517 U.S. 735, 740 (1996)
(‘‘neither antiquity nor contemporaneity with the
statute is a condition of validity.’’). I have no
problem with that proposition, but if the Board
lacks statutory authority to promulgate a rule, it is
of no matter that it attempts to do so in year 1 or
year 76 of its existence.

entitled to deference under the analysis
set forth in Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v.
Natural Resources Defense Council,
Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984). Under
Chevron, where Congress has not
‘‘directly addressed the precise question
at issue,’’ id. at 842–843, that
rulemaking authority may be used in
order ‘‘to fill any gap left, implicitly or
explicitly, by Congress.’’ Id. at 843.
Even assuming that the absence of an
explicit posting requirement in the
NLRA is not interpreted as clear
expression of Congressional intent, the
majority fails to persuade that Congress
delegated authority in Section 6 of the
NLRA for the Board to fill a putative
statutory gap by promulgating a rule
that an employer commits an unfair
labor practice by failing to affirmative
notify its employees of their rights
under the NLRA. As the Supreme Court
has explained, ‘‘the ultimate question is
whether Congress would have intended,
and expected, courts to treat [the
regulation] as within, or outside, its
delegation to the agency of ‘gap-filling’
authority.’’ Long Island Care at Home,
Ltd. v. Coke, 551 U.S. 158, 173 (2007).
There is no doubt that there are many
gaps and ambiguities in the NLRA that
Congress intended for the Board to
address, using its labor expertise, either
through adjudication or rulemaking.
However, the existence of ambiguity in
a statute is not enough per se to warrant
deference to the agency’s interpretation
of its authority in every respect. The
ambiguity must be such as to make it
appear that Congress either explicitly or
implicitly delegated authority to cure
that ambiguity. Am. Bar Ass’n v. FTC,

(‘‘MPAA ’’) (‘‘agency’s interpretation of
[a] statute is not entitled to deference
absent a delegation of authority from
Congress to regulate in the areas at
issue.’’).
Thus, even when an administrative
agency seeks to address what it believes
is a serious interpretive problem, the
Supreme Court has said that the agency
‘‘may not exercise its authority ‘in a
manner that is inconsistent with the
administrative structure that Congress
enacted into law.’ ’’ FDA v. Brown &
Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S.
120, 125(2000) (quoting ETSI Pipeline
Project v. Missouri, 484 U.S. 495,
517(1988)). Further, the statute at issue
must be considered as a ‘‘symmetrical
and coherent regulatory scheme.’’
Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S. 561,
569, 115 S.Ct. 1061, 131 L.Ed.2d 1
(1995). In our case, the exercise of
rulemaking authority under Section 6 is
not self-effectuating; it must be shown
to relate reasonably to some other
provision as part of the overall statutory
scheme contemplated by Congress. 176
Nothing in the text or the regulatory
structure of the NLRA suggests that the
Board has the authority to promulgate
the notice-posting rule at issue in order
to address a gap in the statutory scheme
for resolving questions concerning
representation through Section 9, or in
preventing, through Sections 8 and 10,
specifically enumerated unfair labor
practices that adversely affect
employees’ Section 7 rights. On the
contrary, it is well-established that the
Board lacks independent authority to
initiate or to solicit the initiation of
representation and unfair labor practice
proceedings, and Section 10(a) limits
the Board’s powers to preventing only
the unfair labor practices listed in
Section 8 of the Act. Yet the majority
asserts that it may exceed these
limitations by requiring employers to
post a notice of employee rights and
illustrative unfair labor practices at all
times, regardless of whether a petition
had been filed or an employer has been
found to have committed an unfair labor
practice.
The majority’s reliance on a
combination of Section 7, 8, and 10
warrants special mention. They reason
that an employer interferes with Section
7 rights in general, and thereby violates
Section 8(a)(1), by failing to give
continuous notice to employees of those
rights. It may be a truism that an
employee must be aware of his rights in
order to exercise them, but it does not
follow that it is the employer under our
statutory scheme who must provide
enlightenment or else incur liability for
violating those rights. The new unfair
labor practice created by the rule bears
no reasonable relation to any unfair
labor practice in the NLRA’s preexisting
enforcement scheme developed
over seven decades. 177 It certainly bears
176 See, e.g., Mourning v. Family Publications
Service, Inc., 411 U.S. 356, (1973) Unlike here, the
Federal Reserve Board easily met this standard in
Mourning when issuing a disclosure regulation
under the Truth in Lending Act, even though that
Act did not explicitly require lenders to make such
disclosures. In sustaining the regulation, the Court
found the regulation to be within the Federal
Reserve’s rulemaking authority and, in light of the
legislative history, the disclosure requirement was
not contrary to the statute. ‘‘The crucial distinction,
* * * [was that] the disclosure requirement was in
fact enforced through the statute’s pre-existing
remedial scheme and in a manner consistent with
it.’’ Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., 535
U.S. 81, 94 (2002).
177 The Senate report on the Wagner bill stressed
that unfair labor practices were ‘‘strictly limited to
those enumerated in section 8. This is made clear
by paragraph 8 of section 2, which provides that
‘The term ‘unfair labor practice’ means unfair labor
practice listed in Section 8,’’ and by Section 10(a)
empowering the Board to prevent any unfair labor

no relation to the few examples the
majority can muster in Board precedent.
The only instance with even a passing
resemblance to the rights notice-posting
requirement here is the requirement that
a union give notice of Beck 178 and
General Motors 179 rights. However, the
failure to give such a notice is not per
se unlawful. It becomes an unfair labor
practice only when a union, without
giving notice, takes the affirmative
action of seeking to obligate an
employee to pay fees and dues under a
union-security clause. 180 Beyond that, a
union has no general obligation to give
employees notice of their Beck and
General Motors rights; much less does it
violate the NLRA by failing to do so. By
contrast, the rule promulgated today
imposes a continuing obligation on
employers to post notice of employees’
general rights and, even absent any
affirmative act involving those rights,
makes the failure to maintain such
notice unlawful. 181
Unlike my colleagues, I find that the
Supreme Court’s opinion in Local 357,
Teamsters v. NLRB, 365 U.S. 667 (1961),
speaks directly to this point. In that
case, the Board found a hiring hall
agreement unlawfully discriminatory
per se because, even though it included
an express anti-discrimination
practice ‘‘listed in Section 8.’’ Thus, ‘‘[n]either the
National Labor Relations Board nor the courts are
given any blanket authority to prohibit whatever
labor practices that in their judgment are deemed
to be unfair.’’ S. Rep. No. 573, 74th Cong., 1st Sess.

the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, Vol. II at
2307–2308 (1985).

179 NLRB v. General Motors, 373 U.S. 734 (1963).
180 California Saw & Knife Works, 320 NLRB 224,
233 (1995).
181 None of the FMLA cases cited by the majority
support finding that a failure to post a general
notice of employee rights under the NLRA is
unlawful. In Bachelder, the Ninth Circuit actually
found ‘‘unavailing’’ the employer’s argument that it
had satisfied all its specific FMLA notice
obligations because it had complied with the
FMLA’s general posting rule. Id. at 1127, fn. 5.
Rather, the court found that because the employer
failed to ‘‘notify’’ an employee which of the four
FMLA’s ‘‘leave year’’ calculation methods it had
chosen, the employer ‘‘interfered’’ with that
employee’s rights and, therefore, improperly used
the employee’s FMLA covered absences as a
‘‘negative factor’’ when taking the affirmative
adverse action of discharging her.
Similarly, in neither Greenwell v. Charles
Machine Works, Inc., 2011 WL 1458565 (W.D.Okla.,
2011); Smith v. Westchester County, 769 F. Supp 2d
448 (S.D.N.Y. 2011), was the FMLA general posting
requirement at issue. Smith did not involve a notice
issue and Greenwell involved the employer’s failure
to comply with a different notification obligation
under the FMLA.
In any event, as previously stated, FMLA
expressly provides that employers give notice to
employees of rights thereunder and expressly
provides for sanctions if notice is not given. The
NLRA does neither.

provision, it did not include two
additional provisions that the Board
declared were necessary to prevent
‘‘unlawful encouragement of union
membership.’’ The Court disagreed,
stating
Perhaps the conditions which the Board
attaches to hiring-hall arrangements will in
time appeal to the Congress. Yet, where
Congress has adopted a selective system for
dealing with evils, the Board is confined to
that system. National Labor Relations Board
v. Drivers, etc. Local Union, 362 U.S. 274,
284–290, 80 S.Ct. 706, 712–715, 4 L.Ed.2d
710. Where, as here, Congress has aimed its
sanctions only at specific discriminatory
practices, the Board cannot go farther and
establish a broader, more pervasive
regulatory scheme. 182
Congress in Section 8(a)(1) aimed its
sanctions only at employer actions that
interfere with the exercise of Section 7
rights. By this rulemaking, my
colleagues go farther and establish a
broader, more pervasive regulatory
scheme that targets employer inaction,
or silence, as unlawful interference. As
Local 357 instructs, they lack the
authority to do this. 183
American Hospital Association v.
NLRB, 499 U.S. 606 (1991) (AHA), upon
which the majority heavily relies,
illustrates a valid exercise of authority
under Section 6. In AHA, the Supreme
Court unanimously upheld the Board’s
health care unit rule, finding that
Section 6’s general grant of rulemaking
authority ‘‘was unquestionably
sufficient to authorize the rule at issue
in this case unless limited by some
other provision in the Act.’’ Id. at 609–
10 (emphasis added). The Court further
found that the rule was clearly
consistent with authority under Section
9(b) to make appropriate bargaining unit
determinations. It specifically rejected
the argument that language in 9(b)
directing the Board to decide the
appropriate bargaining unit ‘‘in each
case’’ limited its authority to define
appropriate units by rulemaking.
Congress expressly authorized the
Board in Section 9(b) to determine
appropriate bargaining units and the
Board exercised its rulemaking
authority to promulgate a rule
‘‘necessary to carry out’’ Section 9(b). In
contrast, as previously stated, there is
no reasonable basis for finding that a
rule making it unlawful for employers to
fail to post and maintain a notice of
employee rights and selected illustrative
182 365 U.S. at 676.
183 My colleagues attempt to distinguish Local
357 as limited to an interpretation of Sec. 8(a)(3)
and 8(b)(2)’s prohibition of discriminatory
practices. That may have been the issue before the
Court, but I do not view the quoted rationale as so
limited.
unfair labor practices is necessary to
carry out any substantive section of the
NLRA. Nevertheless, the majority
construes AHA as an endorsement of
deference to the exercise of Section 6
rulemaking authority whenever
Congress did not expressly limit this
authority. This is patently incorrect. ‘‘To
suggest, as the [majority] effectively
does, that Chevron deference is required
any time a statute does not expressly
negate the existence of a claimed
administrative power * * *, is both
flatly unfaithful to the principles of
administrative law * * * and refuted by
precedent.’’ Railway Labor Executives’
Ass’n v. National Mediation Bd., 29
F.3d 655, 671 (D.C.Cir.1994) (citation
omitted). Were courts ‘‘to presume a
delegation of power absent an express
withholding of such power, agencies
would enjoy virtually limitless
hegemony, a result plainly out of
keeping with Chevron and quite likely
with the Constitution as well.’’ Id.
In sum, the majority’s notice rule does
not address a gap that Congress
delegated authority to the Board to fill,
whether by rulemaking or adjudication.
The Supreme Court has made clear that
‘‘[w]here Congress has in the statute
given the Board a question to answer,
the courts will give respect to that
answer; but they must be sure the
question has been asked.’’ NLRB v.
Insurance Agents’ Int’l Union, 361 U.S.
419, 432–433 (1960). The Supreme
Court also has made clear: ‘‘[Congress]
does not * * * hide elephants in
mouseholes.’’ Whitman v. American
Trucking Associations, 531 U.S. 457,
468 (2001).
My colleagues’ action here is
markedly like the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) regulation rejected as
ultra vires by the court of appeals in
Am. Bar Ass’n v. FTC, supra. The FTC
issued a ruling that attorneys engaged in
certain practices were financial
institutions subject to the privacy
provision of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley
Act (GBLA). Upon review of the
detailed statutory scheme at issue, the
court found it ‘‘difficult to believe that
Congress, by any remaining ambiguity,
intended to undertake the regulation [of
a subject] * * * and never mentioned
[it] in the statute.’’ 430 F.3d at 469. The
court further opined that to find the
FTC’s interpretation to be ‘‘deferenceworthy,
we would have to conclude that
Congress not only had hidden a rather
large elephant in a rather obscure
mousehole, but had buried the
ambiguity in which the pachyderm
lurks beneath an incredibly deep mound
of specificity, none of which bears the
footprints of the beast or any indication
that Congress even suspected its

presence.’’ Id. No such conclusion was
possible in that case. No such
conclusion is possible here. Quite
simply, the Board lacks statutory
authority to promulgate a rule that
imposes a new obligation on employers
and creates a new unfair labor practice
to enforce it.
The Rule Is Arbitrary and Capricious
Even if the Board arguably has
rulemaking authority in this area,
deference is unwarranted under
Chevron and the Administrative
Procedure Act if the rule promulgated is
‘‘arbitrary or capricious in substance, or
manifestly contrary to the statute.’’
United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S.
218, 227 (2001). Also see AHA, 499 U.S.
at 618–20 (applying arbitrary and
capricious standard in its consideration
of the Board’s rule on acute care
hospital bargaining units). ‘‘Normally,
an agency rule would be arbitrary and
capricious if the agency has relied on
factors which Congress has not intended
it to consider, entirely failed to consider
an important aspect of the problem,
offered an explanation for its decision
that runs counter to the evidence before
the agency, or is so implausible that it
could not be ascribed to a difference in
view or the product of agency
expertise.’’ Motor Vehicle Mfg. Ass’n of
the U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto.
Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). ‘‘[T]he
agency must examine the relevant data
and articulate a satisfactory explanation
for its action including a ‘rational
connection between the facts found and
the choice made.’ ’’ Id. (quoting
Burlington Truck Lines v. United States,
371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)). See also
Business Roundtable et al. v. S.E.C.,—
F.3d—, 2011 WL 2936808 (D.C. Cir.,
July 22, 2011) (finding SEC acted
arbitrarily and capriciously by relying
on insufficient empirical data
supporting its rule and by completely
discounting contrary studies).
In AHA, the Board’s health care
bargaining units rule was supported by
‘‘the extensive record developed during
the rulemaking proceedings, as well as
its experience in the adjudication of
health care cases during the 13-year
period between the enactment of the
health care amendments and its notice
of proposed rulemaking.’’ AHA, 499
U.S. at 618. The Supreme Court upheld
the validity of the rule finding it ‘‘based
on substantial evidence and supported
by a ‘‘reasoned analysis.’’ Id. at 619
(citing Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass., 463
U.S. at 57).
By contrast, the majority’s articulation
of the need to mandate that employers
violate Section 8(a)(1) unless they post
a notice of employee rights is not based
Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations
54041
mstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2
on substantial evidence, nor does it
provide a satisfactory explanation for
the choice they have made. They
contend that a mandatory notice posting
rule enforceable through Section 8(a)(1)
is needed because they believe that most
employees are unaware of their NLRA
rights and therefore cannot effectively
exercise those rights. This belief is
based on: (1) Some studies indicating
that employees and high school
students about to enter the work force
are generally uninformed about labor
law; (2) an influx of immigrants in the
labor force who are presumably also
uninformed about labor law; (3) the
current low and declining percentage of
union-represented employees in the
private sector, which presumably means
that unions are less likely to be a source
of information about employee rights;
and (4) the absence of any general legal
requirement that employers or anyone
else inform employees about their
NLRA rights. 75 FR 80411.
Neither the Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking nor today’s notice
summarizing comments in response to
that notice come anywhere close to
providing a substantial factual basis
supporting the belief that most
employees are unaware of their NLRA
rights. As for the lack of high school
education on this subject, we have only
a few localized studies cited in a 1995
journal article by a union attorney. 184
With respect to the assumption that
immigrants entering the work force, we
have even less, only anecdotal accounts.
For that matter, beyond the cited journal
article, almost all supposed factual
support for the premise that employees
are generally unaware of their rights
comes in comments received from
individuals, union organizers, attorneys
representing unions, and immigrant
rights and worker assistance
organizations agreeing, based on
professed personal experience, that
most employees (obviously not
including most of the employee
commenters) are unfamiliar with their
NLRA rights. There are, as well,
anecdotal accounts and comments from
employers, employer associations and
184 Peter D. DeChiara, ‘‘The Right to Know: An
Argument for Informing Employees of Their Rights
under the National Labor Relations Act,’’ 32 Harv.
J. on Legis. 431, at 436 and fn. 28 (1995).
In the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the
majority also relied on two articles by Professor
Charles J. Morris, a co-petitioner for notice-posting
rulemaking: ‘‘Renaissance at the NLRB—
Opportunity and Prospect for Non-Legislative
Procedural Reform at the Labor Board,’’ 23 Stetson
L. Rev. 101, 107 (1993); and ‘‘NLRB Protection in
the Nonunion Workplace: A Glimpse at a General
Theory of Section 7 Conduct,’’ 137 U. Pa. L. Rev.
1673, 1675–1676 (1989). Professor Morris did not
refer to any specific evidence supporting a belief
that employees lack knowledge of their rights.
management attorneys to the opposite
effect that the employees know about
their rights under the Act, but my
colleagues find these less persuasive.
In any event, the partisan opinions
and perceptions, although worthy of
consideration, ultimately fail as
substantial evidence supporting the
Board majority’s initial premise for
proposing the rule. There remains the
Board’s conclusion that the decline in
union density provides the missing
factual support. The majority explains
that there was less need for a posting of
information about NLRA rights when
the union density was higher because
‘‘friends and family who belonged to
unions’’ would be a source of
information. This is nothing more than
supposition. There is no empirical
evidence of a correlation between union
density and access to information about
employee rights, just as there are no
broad-based studies supporting the
suppositions about a lack of information
stemming from high school curricula or
the influx of immigrants in the work
force.
At bottom, the inadequacy of the
record to support my colleagues’ factual
premise is of no matter to them. In
response to comments contending that
the articles and studies they cite are old
and inadequately supported, they glibly
respond that the commenters ‘‘cite no
more recent or better supported studies
to the contrary,’’ as if opponents of the
proposed rule bear that burden. Of
course, it is the agency’s responsibility
to make factual findings that support its
decision and those findings must be
supported by substantial evidence that
must examine the relevant data and
articulate a satisfactory explanation for
its action. Burlington Truck Lines, 371
U.S. at 167.
Even more telling is the majority’s
footnote observation that there is no real
need to conduct a study of the extent of
employees’ knowledge of NLRA rights
because the notice posting rule would
be justified even if only 10 percent of
the workforce lacked such knowledge.
This statement betrays the entire factual
premise upon which the rulemaking
initiative was purportedly founded and
reveals a predisposition to issue the rule
regardless of the facts. This is patently
‘‘arbitrary and capricious.’’
Even assuming, if we must, that there
is some factual basis for a concern that
employees lack sufficient information
about their NLRA rights, the majority
also fails to provide a rational
explanation for why that concern
dictates their choice made to address
that concern. Why, for instance, was a
noncompulsory information system,
primarily reliant on personal union
communications, sufficient when the
Wagner Act was passed, but not now?
The union density levels for 1935 and
today are roughly the same. 185 Why at
a time when the Board champions its
new Web site and the Acting General
Counsel continues to encourage the
regional outreach programs initiated by
his predecessor, do my colleagues so
readily dismiss the Board’s role in
providing information about rights
under the statute we administer? For
that matter, why are the numerous
employee, labor organizer, and worker
advocacy groups whose comments
profess awareness of these rights unable
to communicate this information to
those who they know lack such
awareness? Is the problem one of access
or message? Would a reversal of the
union density trend or an increase in
petition and charge filings be the only
reliable indicators of increased
awareness?
I would think that a reasoned
explanation for the choice of a sweeping
rule making it unlawful for employers to
fail to post and maintain notice of
employee rights would at least include
some discussion of these questions and
attempt to marshal more than a
fragmented and inconclusive factual
record to support their choice. The
majority fails to do so. Their rule is
patently arbitrary and capricious.
Executive Order 13496

The majority mentions in passing
Executive Order 13496 186 and the DOL
implementing regulation 187 mandating
that Federal contractors post a notice to
employees of NLRA rights that is in
most respects identical to the notice at
issue here. Their consideration of this
administrative action should have led
them to the understanding that they lack
the authority to do what the President
and DOL clearly could do to advance
essentially the same policy choice.
The authority to require that
contractors agree to post an NLRA
employee rights notice as part of doing
business with the Federal government
comes both from the President’s
authority as chief executive and the
specific grant of Congressional authority
in the Federal Property and
Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C.

attempt to justify the promulgation of
the notice-posting rule by relying on
evidence that employees lacked

the notice of a final rule, DOL rejected
commenters’ contentions that the
Executive Order and implementing
regulation were preempted by the
Board’s jurisdiction under the Garmon
doctrine. 188 Necessarily, this meant that
DOL believed that the rule requiring
federal contractors to post the employee
rights notice did not involve any rights
protected by Section 7 of the Act, such
as a right to receive such information
from their employer, or conduct
prohibited by the Act, such as the
employer’s failure to provide such
information.
Not only does my colleagues’
rulemaking action today contradict
DOL’s preemption analysis, but its flaws
are manifest in comparison to the DOL’s
rule and the authority enabling it.
Conclusion 189
Surely, no one can seriously believe
that today’s rule is primarily intended to
inform employees of their Section 7
right to refrain from or to oppose
organizational activities, collective
bargaining, and union representation.
My colleagues seek through
promulgation of this rule to reverse the
steady downward trend in union
density among private sector employees
in the non-agricultural American
workforce. Theirs is a policy choice
which they purport to effectuate with
the force of law on several fronts in
rulemaking and in case-by-case
adjudication. In this instance, their
action in declaring that employers
violate the law by failing to inform
employees of their Section 7 rights is
both unauthorized and arbitrary and
capricious. Regardless of the arguable
merits of their policy choice or the
broad scope of Chevron deference and
the Board’s rulemaking authority, I am
confident that a reviewing court will
soon rescue the Board from itself and
restore the law to where it was before
the sorcerer’s apprentice sent it askew.
V. Regulatory Procedures
A. Regulatory Flexibility Act
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980
(RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., requires
agencies promulgating final rules to
prepare a final regulatory flexibility
analysis and to develop alternatives
188 San Diego Bldg. Trades Council v. Garmon,
359 U.S. 236, 244 (1959)
189 Because I find the rule is invalid, I find it
unnecessary to comment on the content of the
notice or the consequences, other than finding an
unfair labor practice, if an employer fails to post the
required notice. For the reasons stated in my
dissenting opinion in J. Picini Flooring, 356 NLRB
No. 9 (2010), I also disagree with the rule’s
requirement that certain employers must also
electronically distribute the notice.
wherever possible, when drafting
regulations that will have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small
entities. The focus of the RFA is to
ensure that agencies ‘‘review draft rules
to assess and take appropriate account
of the potential impact on small
businesses, small governmental
jurisdictions, and small organizations,
as provided by the [RFA].’’ E.O. 13272,
Sec. 1, 67 FR 53461 (‘‘Proper
Consideration of Small Entities in
Agency Rulemaking’’). However, an
agency is not required to prepare a final
regulatory flexibility analysis for a final
rule if the agency head certifies that the
rule will not, if promulgated, have a
significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities. 5
U.S.C. 605(b). Based on the analysis
below, in which the Board has
estimated the financial burdens to
employers subject to the NLRA
associated with complying with the
requirements contained in this final
rule, the Board has certified to the Chief
Counsel for Advocacy of the Small
Business Administration (SBA) that this
rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities.
The primary goal of this rule is
notifying employees of their rights
under the NLRA. This goal is achieved
through the posting of notices by
employers subject to the NLRA of the
rights of employees under the NLRA.
The Board will make the notices
available at no cost to employers; there
are no information collection, record
keeping, or reporting requirements.
The Board estimates that in order to
comply with this rule, each employer
subject to the NLRA will spend a total
of 2 hours during the first year in which
the rule is in effect. This includes 30
minutes for the employer to learn where
and how to post the required notices, 30
minutes to acquire the notices from the
Board or its Web site, and 60 minutes
to post them physically and
electronically, depending on where and
how the employer customarily posts
notices to employees. The Board
assumes that these activities will be
performed by a professional or business
worker, who, according to Bureau of
Labor Statistics data, earned a total
hourly wage of about $32.20 in March
2011, including fringe benefits. 190 The
190 Source: U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of
Labor Statistics, ‘‘Economic News Release,’’ Table
B–8, June 3, 2011 (available at http://www.bls.gov).
(The Board is administratively informed that BLS
estimates that fringe benefits are approximately
equal to 40 percent of hourly wages. Thus, to
calculate total average hourly earnings, BLS

Board then multiplied this figure by
2 hours to estimate the average costs for
employers to comply with this rule
during the first year in which the rule
is in effect. Accordingly, this rule is
estimated to impose average costs of
$64.40 per employer subject to the
NLRA (2 hours × $32.20) during the first
year. 191 These costs will decrease
dramatically in subsequent years
because the only employers affected
will be those that did not previously
satisfy their posting requirements or that
have since expanded their facilities or
established new ones. Because the final
rule will not require employers to post
the notice by email, instant messaging,
text messaging, and the like, the cost of
compliance should be, if anything,
somewhat less than the Board
previously estimated.
According to the United States Census
Bureau, there were approximately 6
million businesses with employees in
2007. Of those, the SBA estimates that
all but about 18,300 were small
businesses with fewer than 500
employees. 192 This rule does not apply
to employers that do not meet the
Board’s jurisdictional requirements, but
business workers were $23.00. Table B–8.
Accordingly, the Board multiplied that number by
1.4 to arrive at its estimate of $32.20 average hourly
earnings, including fringe benefits.) In the NPRM,
the Board estimated hourly earnings of $31.02,
based on BLS data from January 2009. 75 FR 80415.
The estimate has been updated to reflect increases
in hourly earnings since that time. Those increases
have been relatively minor, and do not affect the
Board’s conclusion that the economic impact of the
rule will not be significant; see discussion below.
191 The National Roofing Contractors Association
asserts (without support) that ‘‘federal agencies
have a notoriously poor track record in estimating
the costs of new regulations on businesses’’; it
therefore predicts that ‘‘the actual cost for many
employers could be considerably higher.’’ The
Board recognizes that some employers, generally
firms with extensive and/or multiple facilities, may
incur initial compliance costs in excess of the
Board’s estimate. For example, a company with
multiple locations may require more than 30
minutes to physically post the notices on all of its
various bulletin boards. The Board’s estimate,
however, is an average for all employers; many
small employers, especially those with only one
facility and/or limited electronic communication
with employees, may incur lower compliance costs.
In this regard, however, contrary to numerous
comments, such as that of St Mar Enterprises, Inc.,
the Board does not expect that the rule will be
‘‘very burdensome’’ for businesses with more than
one facility. Normally, such firms should have to
learn about the rule’s requirements and acquire the
notices only once, no matter how many facilities are
involved. The same should be true for electronic
posting: downloading the notice and posting it on
an employer’s Web site normally should have to be
done once for all facilities. Thus, the only
additional costs involved for multi-facility firms
should be those of physically posting the notices at
each facility.

the Board does not have the means to
calculate the number of small
businesses within the Board’s
jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Board
assumes for purposes of this analysis
that the great majority of the nearly 6
million small businesses will be
affected, and further that this number is
a substantial number within the
meaning of 5 U.S.C. 601. However, as
discussed below, because the economic
impact on those employers is minimal,
the Board concludes that, under 5
U.S.C. 605, the final rule will not have
a significant economic impact on any
small employers.
The RFA does not define ‘‘significant
economic impact.’’ 5 U.S.C. 601. In the
absence of specific definitions, ‘‘what is
‘significant’ * * * will vary depending
on the problem that needs to be
addressed, the rule’s requirements, and
the preliminary assessment of the rule’s
impact.’’ See A Guide for Government
Agencies: How to Comply with the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, Office of
Advocacy, U.S. Small Business
Administration at 17 (available at
http://www.sba.gov) (SBA Guide). As to
economic impact and whether it is
significant, one important indicator is
the cost of compliance in relation to
revenue of the entity or the percentage
of profits affected. Id. at 17. More
specifically, the criteria to be considered
are:
• Whether the rule will lead to longterm
insolvency, i.e., regulatory costs
that significantly reduce profits;
• Whether the rule will lead to shortterm
insolvency, i.e., increasing
operating expenses or new debt more
than cash reserves and cash flow can
support, causing nonmarginal firms to
close;
• Whether the rule will have
disproportionate effects, placing small
entities at a significant competitive
disadvantage; and
• Whether the rule will result in
inefficiency, i.e., in social costs to small
entities that outweigh the social benefits
resulting from the rule. Id. at 26.
Applying these standards, the Board
concludes that the economic impact of
its notice-posting rule on small
employers is not significant. The Board
has determined that the average cost of
complying with the rule in the first year
for all employers subject to the NLRA
will be $64.40. It is unlikely in the
extreme that this minimal cost would
lead to either the short- or long-term
insolvency of any business entity, or
place small employers at a competitive
disadvantage. Since this rule applies
only to organizations within the NLRB’s
jurisdictional standards, the smallest
employer subject to the rule must have
an annual inflow or outflow across state
lines of at least $50,000. Siemons
Mailing Service, 122 NLRB 81 (1959).
Given that the Board estimates that this
rule will cost, on average, $64.40, the
total cost for the smallest affected
companies would be an amount equal to
less than two-tenths of one percent of
that required annual inflow or outflow
(.13%). The Board concludes that such
a small percentage is highly unlikely to
adversely affect a small business. 193
And, in the Board’s judgment, the social
benefits of employees’ (and employers’)
becoming familiar with employees’
NLRA rights far outweigh the minimal
costs to employers of posting notices
informing employees of those rights. 194
For all the foregoing reasons, the
Board has concluded that the final rule
will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small
entities. 5 U.S.C. 605.
As discussed in the NPRM, because it
assumes that a substantial number of
small businesses will be required to
comply with the rule, the Board
preliminarily considered alternatives
that would minimize the impact of the
rule, including a tiered approach for
small entities with only a few
employees. However, as it also
explained, the Board rejected those
alternatives, concluding that a tiered
approach or an exemption for some
small entities would substantially
undermine the purpose of the rule
because so many employers would be
exempt under the SBA definitions.
Given the very small estimated cost of
compliance, it is possible that the
burden on a small business of
determining whether it fell into a
particular tier might exceed the burden
of compliance. The Board further
pointed out that Congress gave the
Board very broad jurisdiction, with no
suggestion that it wanted to limit
coverage of any part of the NLRA to
only larger employers. The Board also
believes that employees of small
employers have no less need of a Board
notice than have employees of larger
employers. Finally, the Board’s
jurisdictional standards mean that very
small employers will not be covered by
the rule in any case. 75 FR 80416. (A
summary of the Board’s discretionary
jurisdictional standards appears in
§ 104.204, below.) Thus, although
193 In reaching this conclusion, the Board believes
it is likely that employers that might otherwise be
significantly affected even by the low cost of
compliance under this rule will not meet the
Board’s jurisdictional requirements, and
consequently those employers will not be subject to
this rule.
194 See further discussion in section II, subsection
C, Factual Support for the Rule, above.

several comments urge that small
employers be exempted from the rule,
the Board remains persuaded, for the
reasons set forth in the NPRM, that such
an exemption is unwarranted. 195
Some comments contend that, in
concluding that the proposed rule will
not have a significant impact on small
employers, the Board understates the
rule’s actual prospective costs. One
comment, from Baker & Daniels LLP,
argues that the Board improperly
focuses solely on the cost of complying
with the rule—i.e., of printing and
posting the notice—and ignored the
‘‘actual economic impact of the rule’s
effect and purpose.’’ According to this
comment, it is predictable that, as more
employees become aware of their NLRA
rights, they will file more unfair labor
practice charges and elect unions to
serve as their collective-bargaining
representatives. The comment further
asserts that the Board has ignored the
‘‘economic realities of unionization,’’
specifically that union wages are
inflationary; that unions make business
less flexible, less competitive, and less
profitable; and that unions cause job
loss and stifle economic recovery from
recessions. Accordingly, this comment
contends that ‘‘the Board’s RFA
certification is invalid, and [that] the
Board must prepare an initial regulatory
flexibility analysis.’’ Numerous other
comments echo similar concerns, but
without reference to the RFA.
The Board disagrees with the
comment submitted by Baker & Daniels
LLP. 196 Section 605(b) of the RFA states
that an agency need not prepare an
initial regulatory flexibility analysis if
the agency head certifies that the rule
195 Cass County Electric Cooperative says that,
after estimating the average cost of compliance, ‘‘the
NLRB quickly digresses into an attempt to estimate
the cost of the proposed rule on only small
businesses.’’ The Board responds that in estimating
the cost of the rule on small businesses, it was
doing what the RFA explicitly requires (and that
focusing on small businesses, which comprise more
than 99 percent of potentially affected firms, is
hardly a ‘‘digression’’). The comment also asserts
that the Board concluded ‘‘that the cost of
estimating the implementation cost will likely
exceed the cost of implementation, and thus is not
warranted. At best, this is a poor excuse to justify
the rule.’’ This misstates the Board’s observation
that ‘‘Given the very small estimated cost of
compliance, it is possible that the burden on a small
business of determining whether it fell into a
particular tier might exceed the burden of
compliance.’’ This observation was one of the
reasons why the Board rejected a tiered approach
to coverage for small entities, not an ‘‘excuse to
justify the rule.’’ 75 FR 80416.
196 In any event, the comment from Baker &
Daniels LLP and related comments are difficult to
square with the assertions made in numerous other
comments that the notice posting is unnecessary
because employees are already well aware of their
NLRA rights and have made informed decisions not
to join unions or seek union representation.
54044 Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations
mstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2
will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small
entities. 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (emphasis
added). The Board understands the
‘‘economic impact of * * * the rule’’ to
refer to the costs to affected entities of
complying with the rule, not to the
economic impact of a series of
subsequent decisions made by
individual actors in the economy that
are neither compelled by, nor the
inevitable result of, the rule. 197 Even if
more employees opt for union
representation after learning about their
rights, employers can avoid the adverse
effects on business costs, flexibility, and
profitability predicted by Baker &
Daniels LLP and other commenters by
not agreeing to unions’ demands that
might produce those effects. 198
The Board finds support for this view
in the language of Section 603 of the
RFA, which lists the items to be
included in an initial regulatory
flexibility analysis if one is required. 5
U.S.C. 603. Section 603(a) states only
that such analysis ‘‘shall describe the
impact of the proposed rule on small
entities.’’ 5 U.S.C. 603(a). However,
Section 603(b) provides, as relevant
here, that ‘‘[e]ach initial regulatory
flexibility analysis * * * shall
contain—* * *
‘‘(4) a description of the projected
reporting, recordkeeping and other
compliance requirements of the
proposed rule, including an estimate of
the classes of small entities which will
be subject to the requirement and the
type of professional skills necessary for
preparation of the report or record[.]’’ 5
U.S.C. 603(b)(4) (emphasis added). The
Small Business Administration cites, as
examples of ‘‘other compliance
requirements,’’
(a) Capital costs for equipment needed to
meet the regulatory requirements; (b) costs of
modifying existing processes and procedures
to comply with the proposed rule; (c) lost
sales and profits resulting from the proposed
rule; (d) changes in market competition as a
result of the proposed rule and its impact on
small entities or specific submarkets of small
entities; (e) extra costs associated with the
payment of taxes or fees associated with the
proposed rule; and (f) hiring employees
dedicated to compliance with regulatory
requirements. 199
Thus, the ‘‘impact’’ on small entities
referred to in Section 603(a) refers only
197 For RFA purposes, the relevant economic
impact on small entities is the impact of
compliance with the rule. Mid-Tex Electric
Cooperative, Inc. v. FERC, 773 F.2d 327, 342 (D.C.
Cir. 1985), cited in SBA Guide, above, at 77.

obligation to bargain in good faith ‘‘does not compel
either party to agree to a proposal or require the
making of a concession[.]’’ 29 U.S.C. 158(d).

to the rule’s projected compliance costs
to small entities (none of which would
result from posting a workplace notice),
not the kinds of speculative and indirect
economic impact that Baker & Daniels
LLC invokes. 200
Associated Builders and Contractors,
Inc. (ABC) and Retail Industry Leaders
Association (RILA) contend that the
Board’s RFA analysis fails to account for
the costs of electronic notice posting,
especially for employers that
communicate with employees via
multiple electronic means. Both
comments deplore what they consider
to be the rule’s vague requirements in
this respect. ABC argues that clear
guidance is needed, and that the Board
should withdraw the electronic notice
posting requirements until more
information can be gathered. RILA
asserts that ‘‘[d]eciphering and
complying with the Board’s
requirements would impose significant
legal and administrative costs and
inevitably result [in] litigation as parties
disagree about when a communication
is ‘customarily used,’ and whether and
when employees need to be informed
through multiple communications.’’
Numerous comments assert that
employers, especially small employers
that lack professional human resources
staff, will incur significant legal
expenses as they attempt to comply
with the rule. For example, Fisher and
Phillips, a management law firm, urges
that the cost of legal fees should be
included in assessing the economic
impact of the proposed rule: ‘‘[I]t might
be considered naïve to assume that a
significant percentage of small
employers would not seek the advice of
counsel, and it would be equally naïve
to assume that a significant percentage
of those newly-engaged lawyers could
be retained for as little as $31.02/hour.’’
Those comments are not persuasive.
The choice to retain counsel is not a
requirement for complying with the
rule. This is not a complicated or
nuanced rule. The employer is only
required to post a notice provided by
the Board in the same manner in which
that employer customarily posts notices
to its employees. The Board has
explained above what the rule’s
electronic posting provisions require of
employers in general, and it has
simplified those provisions by
eliminating the requirement that notices
be provided by email and many other
forms of electronic communication. 201 It
200 Baker & Daniels LLP cites no authority to
support its contention that the RFA is concerned
with costs other than the costs of compliance with
the rule, and the Board is aware of none.

should not be necessary for employers,
small or large, to add human resources
staff, retain counsel, or resort to
litigation if they have questions
concerning whether the proposed rule
applies to them or about the
requirements for technical compliance
with the rule, including how the
electronic posting provisions
specifically affect their enterprises. 202
Such questions can be directed to the
Board’s regional offices, either by
telephone, personal visit, email, or
regular mail, and will be answered free
of charge by representatives of the
Board. 203
Cass County Electric Cooperative
argues that the Board failed to take into
account legal expenses that employers
will incur if they fail to ‘‘follow the
letter of the proposed rule.’’ The
comment urges that the Board should
estimate the cost to businesses ‘‘should
they have to defend themselves against
an unfair labor practice for failure to
comply with the rule, no matter what
the circumstances for that failure might
be,’’ presumably including failures to
post the notice by employers that are
unaware of the rule and inadvertent
failures to comply with technical
posting requirements. International
Foodservice Distributors Association
contends that the Board also should
have considered the costs of tolling the
statute of limitations when employers
fail to post the notice. However, the
costs referred to in these comments are
costs of not complying with the rule, not
compliance costs. As stated above, for
RFA purposes, the relevant economic
analysis focuses on the costs of
complying with the rule. 204
rule’s electronic notice posting requirements; its
estimated average cost of $62.04 specifically
included such costs. 75 FR 80415. Although ABC
faults the Board for failing to issue a preliminary
request for information (RFI) concerning the ways
employers communicate with employees
electronically, the Board did ask for comments
concerning its RFA certification in the NPRM, id.
at 80416. In this regard, ABC states only that ‘‘many
ABC member companies communicate with
employees through email or other electronic
means,’’ which the Board expressly contemplated
in the NPRM, id. at 80413, and which is also the
Board’s practice with respect to communicating
with its own employees. If ABC has more specific
information it has failed to provide it. In any event,
the final rule will not require email or many other
types of electronic notice.
202 Association of Corporate Counsel contends
that employers will have to modify their policies
and procedures manuals as a result of the rule. The
Board questions that contention, but even if some
employers do take those steps, they would not be
a cost of complying with the rule.
203 Fisher and Phillips also suggest that the Board
failed to take into account the effect that the
proposed rule would have on the Board’s own case
intake and budget. The RFA, however, does not
require an estimate of the economic effects of
proposed rules on Federal agencies.

Some comments assert that the
content of the notice will prompt
employee questions, which managers
and supervisors will have to answer,
and be trained to answer, and that the
Board failed to account for the cost of
such training and discussions in terms
of lost work time. 205 Other comments
contend that employers will incur costs
of opposing an increased number of
union organizing campaigns. 206
Relatedly, several comments state that
employers should be allowed to, and/or
will respond to the notice by informing
employees of aspects of unionization
and collective bargaining that are not
covered by the notice; some suggest that
employers may post their own notices
presenting their point of view. 207 (A few
comments, by contrast, protest that
employers will be prohibited from
presenting their side of the issues raised
by the posting of notices.) The Board
responds that any costs that employers
may incur in responding to employee
questions, in setting forth the
employers’ views on unions and
collective bargaining, or in opposing
union organizing efforts will be incurred
entirely at the employers’ own volition;
they are not a cost of complying with
the rule.
As discussed above, many comments
express concerns that union supporters
will tear down the notices in order to
expose employers to 8(a)(1) liability for
failing to post the notices. Some of these
comments also contend that, as a result,
employers will have to spend
considerable time monitoring the
notices to make sure that they are not
torn down, or incur additional costs of
installing tamper-proof bulletin boards.
One commenter predicts that his
employer will have to spend $20,000 for
such bulletin boards at a single facility,
or a total of $100,000 at all of its
facilities, and even then will have to
spend two hours each month
monitoring the postings. For the reasons
discussed above, the Board is not
convinced at this time that the problem
of posters being torn down is anything
more than speculative, and accordingly
is inclined to discount these predictions
substantially. In any event, the rule
requires only that employers ‘‘take
reasonable steps’’—not every
conceivable step—to ensure that the
205 See, e.g., comments of Cass County Electric
Cooperative and Baker & McKenzie. The latter
estimates that each private sector employee will
spend at least an hour attending meetings
concerning the content of the notice, and that the
cost to the economy in terms of lost employee work
time will be $3.5 billion.
206 See, e.g., comment of Dr. Pepper Snapple
Group.
207 See, e.g., comments of Metro Toyota and
Capital Associated Industries, Inc.
notice is not defaced or torn down. The
rule does not require, or even suggest,
that employers must spend thousands of
dollars to install tamper-proof bulletin
boards or that employers must
constantly monitor the notice. 208
One comment contends that most
small employers do not have 11 x 17-
inch color printers, and therefore will
have to have the posters printed
commercially at a cost that, alone,
assertedly will exceed the Board’s
estimate of the cost of the rule. The
Board understands the concerns of this
small employer. The Board points out
that it will furnish a reasonable number
of copies of the notice free of charge to
any requesting employer. Moreover, as
explained above, employers may
reproduce the notice in black-and-white
and may print the notice on two
standard-sized, 8.5 x 11-inch pages and
tape or bind them together, rather than
having them printed commercially.
A number of comments argue that the
rule will lead to workplace conflict. For
example, the comment of Wiseda
Corporation contains the following:
Unnecessary Confusion and Conflict in the
Workplace. The labor law terms and
industrial union language of the proposed
notice (such as hiring hall and concerted
activity) present an unclear and adversarial
picture to employees. Most non-union
employers like us, who wish to remain nonunion,
encourage cooperative problem
solving. In a modern non-union workplace,
to require such a poster encouraging strikes
and restroom leaflets is disrespectful of the
hard work and good intentions of employers,
management, and employees. The proposed
poster would exist alongside other company
notices on problem-solving, respect for
others, resolving harassment issues, etc., and
would clearly be out of character and
inappropriate. (Emphasis in original.)
Another comment puts it more bluntly:
‘‘The notice as proposed is more of an
invitation to cause employee/employer
disputes rather than an explanation of
employee rights.’’ The Board’s response
is that the ill effects predicted in these
comments, like the predicted adverse
effects of unionization discussed above,
are not costs of compliance with the
rule, but of employees’ learning about
their workplace rights. In addition,
Congress, not the Board, created the
subject rights and did so after finding
that vesting employees with these rights
would reduce industrial strife.
B. Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) 209
The final rule imposes certain
minimal burdens associated with the

employer will be ‘‘bankrupted’’ by fines imposed if
the notice is torn down. As explained above, the
Board does not have the authority to impose fines.

posting of the employee notice required
by § 104.202. As noted in § 104.202(e),
the Board will make the notice
available, and employers will be
permitted to post copies of the notice
that are exact duplicates in content,
size, format, and type size and style.
Under the regulations implementing the
PRA, ‘‘[t]he public disclosure of
information originally supplied by the
Federal government to [a] recipient for
the purpose of disclosure to the public’’
is not considered a ‘‘collection of
information’’ under the Act. See 5 CFR
1320.3(c)(2). Therefore, contrary to
several comments, the posting
requirement is not subject to the
PRA. 210
The Board received no comments
suggesting that the PRA covers the costs
to the Federal government of
administering the regulations
established by the proposed rule.
Therefore, the NPRM’s discussion of
this issue stands.
Accordingly, this rule does not
contain information collection
requirements that require approval by
the Office of Management and Budget
under the PRA (44 U.S.C. 3507 et seq.).
C. Congressional Review Act (CRA) 211
This rule is a ‘‘major rule’’ as defined
by Section 804(2) of the Small Business
Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of
1996 (Congressional Review Act),
because it will have an effect on the
economy of more than $100 million, at
least during the year it takes effect. 5
U.S.C. 804(2)(A). 212 Accordingly, the
210 The California Chamber of Commerce and the
National Council of Agricultural Employers dispute
this conclusion. They assert that the PRA
distinguishes between the ‘‘agencies’’ to which it
applies and the ‘‘Federal government,’’ and
therefore that the exemption provided in 5 CFR
1320.3(c)(2) applies only to information supplied by
‘‘the actual Federal government,’’ not to information
supplied by a Federal agency such as the Board.
The flaw in this argument is that there is no such
legal entity as ‘‘the [actual] Federal government.’’
What is commonly referred to as ‘‘the Federal
government’’ is a collection of the three branches
of the United States government, including the
departments of the executive branch, and the
various independent agencies, including the Board.
If ‘‘the Federal government’’ can be said to act at
all, it can do so only through one or more of those
entities—in this instance, the Board—and that is
undoubtedly the meaning that the drafters of 5 CFR
1320(c)(2) meant to convey.

rule’’ because, as explained in the discussion of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act above, the Board has
estimated that the average cost of compliance with
the rule will be approximately $64.40 per affected
employer; thus, because there are some 6 million
employers that could potentially be affected by the
rule, the total cost to the economy of compliance
with the rule will be approximately $386.4 million.
As further explained, nearly all of that cost will be
incurred during the year in which the rule takes
effect; in subsequent years, the only costs of
compliance will be those incurred by employers
that either open new facilities or expand existing
ones, and those that for one reason or another fail
to comply with the rule during the first year. The
Board therefore expects that the costs of compliance
will be far less than $100 million in the second and
subsequent years. The Board is confident that the
rule will have none of the effects enumerated in 5
U.S.C. 804(2)(B) and (C) above.
213 The Board finds unpersuasive the suggestions
in several comments that the effective date of the
rule be postponed to as late as April 15, 2012. The
Board finds nothing in the requirements of the rule
or in the comments received that would warrant
postponing the effective date.

Subpart A—Definitions, Requirements
for Employee Notice, and Exceptions
and Exemptions
§ 104.201 What definitions apply to this
part?
Employee includes any employee, and
is not limited to the employees of a
particular employer, unless the NLRA
explicitly states otherwise. The term
includes anyone whose work has ceased
because of, or in connection with, any
current labor dispute or because of any
unfair labor practice, and who has not
obtained any other regular and
substantially equivalent employment.
However, it does not include
agricultural laborers, supervisors, or
independent contractors, or anyone
employed in the domestic service of any
family or person at his home, or by his
parent or spouse, or by an employer
subject to the Railway Labor Act (45
U.S.C. 151 et seq.), or by any other
person who is not an employer as
defined in the NLRA. 29 U.S.C. 152(3).
Employee notice means the notice set
forth in the Appendix to Subpart A of
this part that employers subject to the
NLRA must post pursuant to this part.
Employer includes any person acting
as an agent of an employer, directly or
indirectly. The term does not include
the United States or any wholly owned
Government corporation, or any Federal
Reserve Bank, or any State or political
subdivision thereof, or any person
subject to the Railway Labor Act, or any
labor organization (other than when
acting as an employer), or anyone acting
in the capacity of officer or agent of
such labor organization. 29 U.S.C.
152(2). Further, the term ‘‘employer’’
does not include entities over which the
Board has been found not to have
jurisdiction, or over which the Board
has chosen through regulation or
adjudication not to assert jurisdiction.
Labor organization means any
organization of any kind, or any agency
or employee representation committee
or plan, in which employees participate
and which exists for the purpose, in
whole or in part, of dealing with
employers concerning grievances, labor
disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours of
employment, or conditions of work. 29
U.S.C. 152(5).
National Labor Relations Board
(Board) means the National Labor
Relations Board provided for in section

partnerships, associations, corporations,
legal representatives, trustees, trustees
in cases under title 11 of the United
States Code, or receivers. 29 U.S.C.
152(1).
Rules, regulations, and orders, as used
in § 104.202, means rules, regulations,
and relevant orders issued by the Board
pursuant to this part.
Supervisor means any individual
having authority, in the interest of the
employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay
off, recall, promote, discharge, assign,
reward, or discipline other employees,
or responsibly to direct them, or to
adjust their grievances, or effectively to
recommend such action, if in
connection with the foregoing the
exercise of such authority is not of a
merely routine or clerical nature, but
requires the use of independent
judgment. 29 U.S.C. 152(11).
Unfair labor practice means any
unfair labor practice listed in section 8
of the National Labor Relations Act, 29
U.S.C. 158. 29 U.S.C. 152(8).
Union means a labor organization as
defined above.
§ 104.202 What employee notice must
employers subject to the NLRA post in the
workplace?
(a) Posting of employee notice. All
employers subject to the NLRA must
post notices to employees, in
conspicuous places, informing them of
their NLRA rights, together with Board
contact information and information
concerning basic enforcement
procedures, in the language set forth in
the Appendix to Subpart A of this part.
(b) Size and form requirements. The
notice to employees shall be at least 11
inches by 17 inches in size, and in such
format, type size, and style as the Board
shall prescribe. If an employer chooses
to print the notice after downloading it
from the Board’s Web site, the printed
notice shall be at least 11 inches by 17
inches in size.
(c) Adaptation of language. The
National Labor Relations Board may
find that an Act of Congress,
clarification of existing law by the
courts or the Board, or other
circumstances make modification of the
employee notice necessary to achieve
the purposes of this part. In such
circumstances, the Board will promptly
issue rules, regulations, or orders as are
needed to ensure that all future
employee notices contain appropriate
language to achieve the purposes of this
part.
(d) Physical posting of employee
notice. The employee notice must be
posted in conspicuous places where
they are readily seen by employees,
including all places where notices to
Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 168 / Tuesday, August 30, 2011 / Rules and Regulations
54047
mstockstill on DSK4VPTVN1PROD with RULES2
employees concerning personnel rules
or policies are customarily posted.
Where 20 percent or more of an
employer’s workforce is not proficient
in English and speaks a language other
than English, the employer must post
the notice in the language employees
speak. If an employer’s workforce
includes two or more groups
constituting at least 20 percent of the
workforce who speak different
languages, the employer must either
physically post the notice in each of
those languages or, at the employer’s
option, post the notice in the language
spoken by the largest group of
employees and provide each employee
in each of the other language groups a
copy of the notice in the appropriate
language. If an employer requests from
the Board a notice in a language in
which it is not available, the requesting
employer will not be liable for noncompliance
with the rule until the
notice becomes available in that
language. An employer must take
reasonable steps to ensure that the
notice is not altered, defaced, covered
by any other material, or otherwise
rendered unreadable.
(e) Obtaining a poster with the
employee notice. A poster with the
required employee notice, including a
poster with the employee notice
translated into languages other than
English, will be printed by the Board,
and may be obtained from the Board’s
office, 1099 14th Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20570, or from any of
the Board’s regional, subregional, or
resident offices. Addresses and
telephone numbers of those offices may
be found on the Board’s Web site at
http://www.nlrb.gov. A copy of the
poster in English and in languages other
than English may also be downloaded
from the Board’s Web site at http://
www.nlrb.gov. Employers also may
reproduce and use copies of the Board’s
official poster, provided that the copies
duplicate the official poster in size,
content, format, and size and style of
type. In addition, employers may use
commercial services to provide the
employee notice poster consolidated
onto one poster with other Federally
mandated labor and employment
notices, so long as the consolidation
does not alter the size, content, format,
or size and style of type of the poster
provided by the Board.
(f) Electronic posting of employee
notice. (1) In addition to posting the
required notice physically, an employer
must also post the required notice on an
intranet or internet site if the employer
customarily communicates with its
employees about personnel rules or
policies by such means. An employer
that customarily posts notices to
employees about personnel rules or
policies on an intranet or internet site
will satisfy the electronic posting
requirement by displaying
prominently—i.e., no less prominently
than other notices to employees—on
such a site either an exact copy of the
poster, downloaded from the Board’s
Web site, or a link to the Board’s Web
site that contains the poster. The link to
the Board’s Web site must read,
‘‘Employee Rights under the National
Labor Relations Act.’’
(2) Where 20 percent or more of an
employer’s workforce is not proficient
in English and speaks a language other
than English, the employer must
provide notice as required in paragraph
(f)(1) of this section in the language the
employees speak. If an employer’s
workforce includes two or more groups
constituting at least 20 percent of the
workforce who speak different
languages, the employer must provide
the notice in each such language. The
Board will provide translations of the
link to the Board’s Web site for any
employer that must or wishes to display
the link on its Web site. If an employer
requests from the Board a notice in a
language in which it is not available, the
requesting employer will not be liable
for non-compliance with the rule until
the notice becomes available in that
language.
§ 104.203 Are Federal contractors covered
under this part?
Yes, Federal contractors are covered.
However, contractors may comply with
the provisions of this part by posting the
notices to employees required under the
Department of Labor’s notice-posting
rule, 29 CFR part 471.
§ 104.204 What entities are not subject to
this part?
(a) The following entities are
excluded from the definition of
‘‘employer’’ under the National Labor
Relations Act and are not subject to the
requirements of this part:
Employer category

(4) Any person subject to the Railway
Labor Act;
(5) Any labor organization (other than
when acting as an employer); or
(6) Anyone acting in the capacity of
officer or agent of such labor
organization.
(b) In addition, employers employing
exclusively workers who are excluded
from the definition of ‘‘employee’’
under § 104.201 are not covered by the
requirements of this part.
(c) This part does not apply to entities
over which the Board has been found
not to have jurisdiction, or over which
the Board has chosen through regulation
or adjudication not to assert
jurisdiction.
(d)(1) This part does not apply to
entities whose impact on interstate
commerce, although more than de
minimis, is so slight that they do not
meet the Board’s discretionary
jurisdiction standards. The most
commonly applicable standards are:
(i) The retail standard, which applies
to employers in retail businesses,
including home construction. The Board
will take jurisdiction over any such
employer that has a gross annual
volume of business of $500,000 or more.
(ii) The nonretail standard, which
applies to most other employers. It is
based either on the amount of goods
sold or services provided by the
employer out of state (called ‘‘outflow’’)
or goods or services purchased by the
employer from out of state (called
‘‘inflow’’). The Board will take
jurisdiction over any employer with an
annual inflow or outflow of at least
$50,000. Outflow can be either direct—
to out-of-state purchasers—or indirect—
to purchasers that meet other
jurisdictional standards. Inflow can also
be direct—purchased directly from out
of state—or indirect—purchased from
sellers within the state that purchased
them from out-of-state sellers.
(2) There are other standards for
miscellaneous categories of employers.
These standards are based on the
employer’s gross annual volume of
business unless stated otherwise. These
standards are listed in the Table to this
section.

Appendix to Subpart A—Text of
Employee Notice
‘‘EMPLOYEE RIGHTS UNDER THE
NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT
The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)
guarantees the right of employees to organize
and bargain collectively with their
employers, and to engage in other protected
concerted activity or to refrain from engaging
in any of the above activity. Employees
covered by the NLRA* are protected from
certain types of employer and union
misconduct. This Notice gives you general
information about your rights, and about the
obligations of employers and unions under
the NLRA. Contact the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB), the Federal agency
that investigates and resolves complaints
under the NLRA, using the contact
information supplied below, if you have any
questions about specific rights that may
apply in your particular workplace.
‘‘Under the NLRA, you have the right to:
• Organize a union to negotiate with your
employer concerning your wages, hours, and
other terms and conditions of employment.
• Form, join or assist a union.
• Bargain collectively through
representatives of employees’ own choosing
for a contract with your employer setting
your wages, benefits, hours, and other
working conditions.
• Discuss your wages and benefits and
other terms and conditions of employment or
union organizing with your co-workers or a
union.
• Take action with one or more co-workers
to improve your working conditions by,
among other means, raising work-related
complaints directly with your employer or
with a government agency, and seeking help
from a union.
• Strike and picket, depending on the
purpose or means of the strike or the
picketing.
• Choose not to do any of these activities,
including joining or remaining a member of
a union.
‘‘Under the NLRA, it is illegal for your
employer to:
• Prohibit you from talking about or
soliciting for a union during non-work time,
such as before or after work or during break
times; or from distributing union literature

during non-work time, in non-work areas,
such as parking lots or break rooms.
• Question you about your union support
or activities in a manner that discourages you
from engaging in that activity.
• Fire, demote, or transfer you, or reduce
your hours or change your shift, or otherwise
take adverse action against you, or threaten
to take any of these actions, because you join
or support a union, or because you engage in
concerted activity for mutual aid and
protection, or because you choose not to
engage in any such activity.
• Threaten to close your workplace if
workers choose a union to represent them.
• Promise or grant promotions, pay raises,
or other benefits to discourage or encourage
union support.
• Prohibit you from wearing union hats,
buttons, t-shirts, and pins in the workplace
except under special circumstances.
• Spy on or videotape peaceful union
activities and gatherings or pretend to do so.
‘‘Under the NLRA, it is illegal for a union
or for the union that represents you in
bargaining with your employer to:
• Threaten or coerce you in order to gain
your support for the union.
• Refuse to process a grievance because
you have criticized union officials or because
you are not a member of the union.
• Use or maintain discriminatory
standards or procedures in making job
referrals from a hiring hall.
• Cause or attempt to cause an employer
to discriminate against you because of your
union-related activity.
• Take adverse action against you because
you have not joined or do not support the
union.
‘‘If you and your co-workers select a union
to act as your collective bargaining
representative, your employer and the union

are required to bargain in good faith in a
genuine effort to reach a written, binding
agreement setting your terms and conditions
of employment. The union is required to
fairly represent you in bargaining and
enforcing the agreement.
‘‘Illegal conduct will not be permitted. If
you believe your rights or the rights of others
have been violated, you should contact the
NLRB promptly to protect your rights,
generally within six months of the unlawful
activity. You may inquire about possible
violations without your employer or anyone
else being informed of the inquiry. Charges
may be filed by any person and need not be
filed by the employee directly affected by the
violation. The NLRB may order an employer
to rehire a worker fired in violation of the
law and to pay lost wages and benefits, and
may order an employer or union to cease
violating the law. Employees should seek
assistance from the nearest regional NLRB
office, which can be found on the Agency’s
Web site: http://www.nlrb.gov.
You can also contact the NLRB by calling
toll-free: 1–866–667–NLRB (6572) or (TTY)

‘‘*The National Labor Relations Act covers
most private-sector employers. Excluded
from coverage under the NLRA are publicsector
employees, agricultural and domestic
workers, independent contractors, workers
employed by a parent or spouse, employees
of air and rail carriers covered by the Railway
Labor Act, and supervisors (although
supervisors that have been discriminated
against for refusing to violate the NLRA may
be covered).
‘‘This is an official Government Notice and
must not be defaced by anyone.’’
Subpart B—General Enforcement and
Complaint Procedures
§ 104.210 How will the Board determine
whether an employer is in compliance with
this part?
The Board has determined that
employees must be aware of their NLRA
rights in order to exercise those rights
effectively. Employers subject to this
rule are required to post the employee
notice to inform employees of their
rights. Failure to post the employee
notice may be found to interfere with,
restrain, or coerce employees in the
exercise of the rights guaranteed by
NLRA Section 7, 29 U.S.C. 157, in
violation of NLRA Section 8(a)(1), 29
U.S.C. 158(a)(1).
Normally, the Board will determine
whether an employer is in compliance
when a person files an unfair labor
practice charge alleging that the
employer has failed to post the
employee notice required under this
part. Filing a charge sets in motion the
Board’s procedures for investigating and
adjudicating alleged unfair labor
practices, and for remedying conduct
that the Board finds to be unlawful. See
NLRA Sections 10–11, 29 U.S.C. 160–
61, and 29 CFR part 102, subpart B.
§ 104.211 What are the procedures for
filing a charge?
(a) Filing charges. Any person (other
than Board personnel) may file a charge
with the Board alleging that an
employer has failed to post the
employee notice as required by this
part. A charge should be filed with the
Regional Director of the Region in
which the alleged failure to post the
required notice is occurring.
(b) Contents of charges. The charge
must be in writing and signed, and must
be sworn to before a Board agent, notary
public, or other person authorized to
administer oaths or take
acknowledgements, or contain a
declaration by the person signing it,
under penalty of perjury, that its
contents are true and correct. The
charge must include:
(1) The charging party’s full name and
address;
(2) If the charge is filed by a union,
the full name and address of any
national or international union of which
it is an affiliate or constituent unit;
(3) The full name and address of the
employer alleged to have violated this
part; and
(4) A clear and concise statement of
the facts constituting the alleged unfair
labor practice.
§ 104.212 What are the procedures to be
followed when a charge is filed alleging that
an employer has failed to post the required
employee notice?
(a) When a charge is filed with the
Board under this section, the Regional
Director will investigate the allegations
of the charge. If it appears that the
allegations are true, the Regional
Director will make reasonable efforts to
persuade the respondent employer to
post the required employee notice
expeditiously. If the employer does so,
the Board expects that there will rarely
be a need for further administrative
proceedings.
(b) If an alleged violation cannot be
resolved informally, the Regional
Director may issue a formal complaint
against the respondent employer,
alleging a violation of the notice-posting
requirement and scheduling a hearing
before an administrative law judge.
After a complaint issues, the matter will
be adjudicated in keeping with the
Board’s customary procedures. See
NLRA Sections 10 and 11, 29 U.S.C.
160, 161; 29 CFR part 102, subpart B.

§ 104.213 What remedies are available to
cure a failure to post the employee notice?
(a) If the Board finds that the
respondent employer has failed to post
the required employee notices as
alleged, the respondent will be ordered
to cease and desist from the unlawful
conduct and post the required employee
notice, as well as a remedial notice. In
some instances additional remedies may
be appropriately invoked in keeping
with the Board’s remedial authority.
(b) Any employer that threatens or
retaliates against an employee for filing
charges or testifying at a hearing
concerning alleged violations of the
notice-posting requirement may be
found to have committed an unfair labor
practice. See NLRA Section 8(a)(1) and
8(a)(4), 29 U.S.C. 158(a)(1), (4).
§ 104.214 How might other Board
proceedings be affected by failure to post
the employee notice?
(a) Tolling of statute of limitations.
When an employee files an unfair labor
practice charge, the Board may find it
appropriate to excuse the employee
from the requirement that charges be
filed within six months after the
occurrence of the allegedly unlawful
conduct if the employer has failed to
post the required employee notice
unless the employee has received actual
or constructive notice that the conduct
complained of is unlawful. See NLRA
Section 10(b), 29 U.S.C. 160(b).
(b) Noncompliance as evidence of
unlawful motive. The Board may
consider a knowing and willful refusal
to comply with the requirement to post
the employee notice as evidence of
unlawful motive in a case in which
motive is an issue.
Subpart C—Ancillary Matters
§ 104.220 What other provisions apply to
this part?
(a) The regulations in this part do not
modify or affect the interpretation of
any other NLRB regulations or policy.
(b)(1) This subpart does not impair or
otherwise affect:
(i) Authority granted by law to a
department, agency, or the head thereof;
or
(ii) Functions of the Director of the
Office of Management and Budget
relating to budgetary, administrative, or
legislative proposals.
(2) This subpart must be implemented
consistent with applicable law and
subject to the availability of
appropriations.
(c) This part creates no right or
benefit, substantive or procedural,
enforceable at law or in equity by any
party against the United States, its
departments, agencies, or entities, its

devised by Western powers for Iraq and Syria, in
particular, are not standing up well to the test of
time ... and Pakistan’s policies have contributed
to Afghanistan’s precarious condition.”” Iran
and Saudi Arabia compete for influence in the
region, and the Sunni-Shia divide that was not a
geopolitical factor 40 years ago will continue to
escalate tensions in the region.

Another potential risk in the region is the
dismantling of the Iran nuclear deal by the Trump
administration.”° In the absence of a deal, Iran
would return to building its nuclear capabilities,
thereby increasing the risks of a military strike by
Israel or the US.

We assign a low probability to such an event
for two reasons. First, we point to comments made
by secretary of defense nominee retired General
James Mattis, which suggest a different approach
in dealing with Iran.’”’ In a speech in April 2016 at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies,
Mattis said “there is no going back” on the deal
“absent a clear and present violation.”’* Second,
other signatories to the deal, including Russia and
China, would not support a unilateral dismantling
of the deal by the new administration.” That is not
to say that tensions between the US and Iran will
not continue this year.

Turmoil in the region will continue into 2017
and beyond. While the direct impact of such
conflicts on global growth and world equity
markets is limited outside a war among major
powers, the threat posed by terrorism is significant
and growing.

Terrorism Escalates

Another high-probability but uncertain-impact
risk is increased terrorism. The Middle East has
been the main source of terrorism even before the
September 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade
Center. The majority of the 9/11 perpetrators,

15 out of 19, were from Saudi Arabia, with the
rest from other Arab countries in the region.
Since then, the spread of ISIL, the Syrian civil
war, extremism in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and

the immigration of Arabs and North Africans
to Europe and, to a lesser extent, the US, have
increased the incidence of terrorism in the West.

In 2016, there were five key terrorist incidents
in the US and 15 in Europe, including a December
19 attack when a truck rammed into a Christmas
market in Berlin.** Some of the terrorists
responsible were inspired by ISIL,** and some were
lone-wolf Islamic extremists who had lived in their
respective countries for years. With a growing
number of refugees in Europe, it is highly likely
that this pace of terrorism will continue.

Terrorist attacks and geopolitical tensions in
the Middle East take more than their immediate
human toll. While consumer confidence in the
US is now above the pre-global financial crisis
peak of July 2007 (see Exhibit 25), Gallup Poll
data shows that dissatisfaction remains at a very
high level, similar to that at the beginning of
the global financial crisis. As shown in Exhibit
26, the dissatisfaction rate increased steadily in
the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and
the US wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. It had
already reached current levels before the global
financial crisis.

Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke has named traumatic national shocks
such as 9/11 along with political polarization
and “shrill” political debates as possible culprits
of the contradictory signals between the high
levels of consumer confidence as measured by
the Conference Board and the high levels of
dissatisfaction as measured by Gallup Polls.™

Risks of continued terrorism are very high,
but the broader economic impact of the type of
terrorist acts we witnessed in 2016 is limited. We
can only hope that large attacks such as 9/11 do
not occur again.

Cyberattacks Continue

High-profile cyberattacks or cyberattack
announcements were a regular feature of 2016.
The highest-profile attacks were those perpetrated
by the Russian government on the Democratic
National Committee computer network, according
to a joint statement from the Department of
Homeland Security and Office of the Director

of National Intelligence on Election Security.®
The US government expelled 35 Russian officials
and imposed sanctions on four high-ranking
members of the Russian military intelligence unit
as a result.*

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023371.txt,"In re: TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001., 2012 WL 257568 (2012)

*1 Preliminary Statement

Plaintiffs-Appellants are family members of the nearly 3,000 people killed in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks;
thousands of individuals who were severely injured as a result of the attacks; and commercial entities that incurred billions of
dollars of property damage and other losses as a result of the attacks (collectively “the September 11th plaintiffs” and/or
“olaintiffs”). Consistent with the rights conferred upon them by the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), Torture Victim Protection
Act (TVPA), Alien Tort Statute (ATS), and long-standing principles of common law concerted action liability, plaintiffs
brought these lawsuits, which were consolidated below by the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation, to hold accountable
the charities, financial institutions, individuals and other parties that knowingly provided material support or resources to
al-Qaeda for more than a decade before September 11, 2001, and thereby provided al-Qaeda with the means to successfully
conceive, plan, coordinate, and carry out the September 11th Attacks. The district court dismissed plaintiffs’ claims against
five defendants-appellees (“Defendants”) pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), holding that, despite the existence of remedies
specifically designed for victims of terrorist attacks, plaintiffs *2 were entitled to seek no relief against those who had
supported, conspired with, and/or aided and abetted al-Qaeda in carrying out the worst terrorist attack ever to take place on
American soil.! This Court should reverse the district court’s rulings with respect to these Defendants -- Al Rajhi Banking &
Investment Corp. (“Al Rajhi Bank”), Saudi American Bank, Saleh Abdullah Kamel, Dallah al Baraka, and Dar-Al-Maal Al
Islami (“DMI”) Trust -- because the pleadings sufficiently allege that each of these Defendants knowingly provided material
support and resources to al Qaeda in the years leading up to the September 11th Attacks, so that each of them is properly held
accountable under the ATA, the TVPA, RICO, the ATS, and/or the common law.

Taken collectively, the facts and allegations contained in the plaintiffs’ complaints, RICO and More Definite Statements, and
extrinsic materials formed a vast record, spanning literally tens of thousands of *3 pages. Evaluated in a manner consistent
with the standards of review for motions addressed to the adequacy of pleadings, the vast record presented by plaintiffs to the
district court established that plaintiffs’ allegations were sufficient to state claims against the Defendants under the ATA and
other relevant causes of action.

In the face of these extraordinarily detailed and supported pleadings, which more than satisfied the requirements of Rule 8,
the district court nonetheless held plaintiffs to an improper heightened pleading standard, specially applicable to cases
involving allegations of terrorism. Nothing in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and no precedent of this Court or any
other of which plaintiffs are aware, authorized this heightened standard, nor is such a heightened standard appropriate for
plaintiffs who have suffered such grievous injuries or for defendants who are alleged to have committed such heinous acts.

The district court also ignored the wealth of details provided by plaintiffs in their supplemental filings, failed to credit the
allegations in the pleadings, and failed to draw inferences in the plaintiffs’ favor. The court also misconstrued the scope of
the Alien Tort Statute, under the erroneous belief that acts of international terrorism do not, in and of themselves, *4 violate
the “laws of nations” unless they involve the hijacking of an airplane. The court also applied the wrong statute of limitations
to certain of plaintiffs’ claims and misconstrued the scope of the TVPA. The combination of these errors resulted in the
dismissal of all of plaintiffs’ claims against some of the most significant financial institutions that provided knowing support
to al-Qaeda, enabling it to train the September 11 hijackers and plan and carry out the attacks. And, in dismissing three
Defendants on the basis of sovereign immunity, the district court applied a decision of this Court that has since been
overruled.

This Court should reverse the judgment of the district court and hold that plaintiffs may pursue their claims against these
financial sponsors of terrorism.

Statement Of Subject Matter and Appellate Jurisdiction

The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York had subject matter jurisdiction over these actions
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1330, 1331, 1332, 1350, 1367, 1407, and 1605, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1964 and 2338, and 49 U.S.C. §40101.

This duality—desperate need for love entwined with either willful
ignorance or even nuanced hate—has underlain the Arab view of
America for a generation, unchanged even by the collapse of the
Twin Towers. But based on my recent trip across the region, a
confluence—Arab Spring and the technology that empowered it—has
provided the U.S. a new chance to push reset with a half-billion
Arabs, as long as it can shout louder than increasingly sophisticated
bunk merchants like El Aschkar.

Ask about basic political facts—al Qaeda’s responsibility for 9/11, or
the death of Osama bin Laden—and even the most educated will start
popping off inanities.

I’ve been dealing with this frustrating relationship for much of the
past decade. Shortly after 9/11, in an effort to win Arab “hearts and
minds” in the mold of the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe,
the State Department poured hundreds of millions into a new public-
diplomacy initiative, overseen by former ad executive Charlotte Beers
and then Bush communications czar Karen Hughes. In short order
came Radio Sawa (“together’’), television’s Alhurra (“the free one’’)
and Hi Magazine (named for the one English word the whole world
knows), which, inspired by the post-9/11 call to service, I steered
editorially in print and online in 2003 and 2004.

Hi, sold on newsstands in 20 Arab countries, was charged with
providing a window into, and dialogue with, the U.S. for Arabs
between 18 and 35. To maximize the project’s efficacy, I conducted
perhaps the most extensive qualitative study of Arab sentiment about
America in the post-9/11 era. With two colleagues, I traveled across
the Arab world—the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Lebanon, and
Morocco—for two weeks on what we called a “listening research
tour,” interviewing scores of young Arabs individually, in focus
groups and at giant roundtables, using Hi as proxy for the region’s
perpetual question: what do you think about the U.S.? While the

Trump ambassador without portfolio. He declared himself Trump’s man on Wall Street,
even if, practically speaking, he wasn’t a Trump man and he was exiting his firm on Wall
Street. He was also in constant touch with anybody from the Trump circle who was
willing to be in touch with him.

The “What to do with the Mooch” question persisted. Kushner, with whom Scaramucci
had exercised a rare restraint during the campaign, and who had steadily heard from other
New York contacts about Scaramucci’s continued loyalty, helped push the question.

Priebus and others held Scaramucci at bay until June and then, as a bit of a punch line,
Scaramucci was offered and, degradingly, had to accept, being named senior vice
president and chief strategy officer for the U.S. Export-Import Bank, an executive branch
agency Trump had long vowed to eliminate. But the Mooch was not ready to give up the
fight: after yet more lobbying, he was offered, at Bannon’s instigation, the post of
ambassador to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. The job
came with a twenty-room apartment on the Seine, a full staff, and—Bannon found this
part particularly amusing—absolutely no influence or responsibilities.

OOK Ok

Meanwhile, another persistent question, “What to do with Spicer,” seemed to somehow
have been joined to the disaster involving the bungled response to the news of the June
2016 meeting between Don Jr., Jared, and the Russians. Since the president, while
traveling on Air Force One, had actually dictated Don Jr.’s response to the initial 7imes
report about the meeting, the blame for this should have been laid at the feet of Trump and
Hope Hicks: Trump dictated, Hicks transcribed. But because no disasters could be laid at
the president’s feet, Hicks herself was spared. And, even though he had been pointedly
excluded from the Trump Tower crisis, the blame for the episode was now put at Spicer’s
feet, precisely because, his loyalty in doubt, he and the communications staff had to be
excluded.

In this, the comms team was judged to be antagonistic if not hostile to the interests of
Jared and Ivanka; Spicer and his people had failed to mount an inclusive defense for them,
nor had the comms team adequately defended the White House. This of course homed in
on the essential and obvious point: although the junior first couple were mere staffers and
not part of the institutional standing of the White House, they thought and acted as if they
were part of the presidential entity. Their ire and increasing bitterness came from some of
the staff’s reluctance—teally, a deep and intensifying resistance—to treat them as part and
parcel of the presidency. (Once Priebus had to take Ivanka aside to make sure she
understood that in her official role, she was just a staffer. Ivanka had insisted on the
distinction that she was a staffer-slash-First Daughter.)

Bannon was their public enemy; they expected nothing of him. But Priebus and Spicer

Scarleteen, my favorite sex education site, has a great article about squirting orgasms
and how some women feel pressured to squirt for the sake of the sexual novelty. On a
similar note, I'll close this post with an anecdote about a guy I dated a while back who
was very focused on giving me orgasms. To his credit, he figured out how to make me
come very quickly. But the problem was that -- I soon realized -- the biggest reason he
wanted to make me come was because he wanted to feel like he could.
Fundamentally, it wasn't about my pleasure; it was about him feeling like the man.”

Let me be clear: he was a great guy, and I was into having sex with him. But it became
very obvious to me that if I didn't have an orgasm every time we had sex, then he would
be really bothered. So there were definitely a few encounters where, although I wasn't
especially interested in having an orgasm, I still closed my eyes and flicked through
fantasies with a kind of panic... until I managed to kick-start my body into coming. Isn't
that messed up?

One thing I've learned, in years of writing about sex and gender, is that anything --
anything at all -- can be a tool for limiting or stifling sexuality... just as much as it can be
a tool for releasing sexuality. Turns out, orgasms are no exception. Even orgasms can
become a difficult duty. I'm so glad that I know how to have an orgasm now; for me,
that was an important step for my sexuality and my self-esteem. But now that I've
learned how to do that, I find myself questioning why it's such an important and
destructive issue in the first place!

Sex is a journey. There are so many directions, so many forks in the road, so many stops
along the way. There are so many speedbumps and roadblocks, uphills and downhills,
free and easy open stretches. Sometimes people stop to rest. Sometimes people double
back. Everything is evolving. A lot of people find it most awesome to simply... enjoy the
road.

te ok ok

When I was in my late teens, I had a couple straight lady friends who did this thing where
they took a year of chastity... although they had already had a fair amount of sex. It
wasn't that they thought sex was bad. It wasn't that they especially disliked sex. It wasn't
that they regretted choosing to have sex previously. But these women felt powerfully
drawn towards taking a year away from sex, a year where no sex happened in their lives...
and I instinctively understood because I felt the same urge. In fact, I came up with the
idea of deliberately taking a year of chastity on my own, before I heard that anyone else
was doing it.

I'm not telling you this because I want to sound like one of the cool kids; I'm not trying
to say anything like, I was into chastity when it was underground! As it happened, I
never actually went through with my chastity urge. But I thought about it a lot, and I
thought about the fact that other girls I knew were doing it. We didn't have backgrounds
that one would normally consider anti-sex. We had liberal backgrounds, liberal parents,
liberal educations. Why were we so attracted to the idea of taking a year without sex?

I thought about it a lot, and I concluded this: We felt like we didn't own our sexuality.

concepts like greed and deception and describes the process that produces email scams.
That lets me recognize the classic Nigerian email spam, but it also lets me imagine many
different kinds of possible spam. When I get the journal email, I can work backward:
“This seems like just the kind of mail that would come out of a spam-generating
process.”

The new excitement about AI comes because AI researchers have recently
produced powerful and effective versions of both these learning methods. But there is
nothing profoundly new about the methods themselves.

Bottom-up Deep Learning

In the 1980s, computer scientists devised an ingenious way to get computers to detect
patterns in data: connectionist, or neural-network, architecture (the “neural” part was, and
still is, metaphorical). The approach fell into the doldrums in the ’90s but has recently
been revived with powerful “deep-learning” methods like Google’s DeepMind.

For example, you can give a deep-learning program a bunch of Internet images
labeled “cat,” others labeled “house,” and so on. The program can detect the patterns
differentiating the two sets of images and use that information to label new images
correctly. Some kinds of machine learning, called unsupervised learning, can detect
patterns in data with no labels at all; they simply look for clusters of features—what
scientists call a factor analysis. In the deep-learning machines, these processes are
repeated at different levels. Some programs can even discover relevant features from the
raw data of pixels or sounds; the computer might begin by detecting the patterns in the
raw image that correspond to edges and lines and then find the patterns in those patterns
that correspond to faces, and so on.

Another bottom-up technique with a long history is reinforcement learning. In the
1950s, B. F. Skinner, building on the work of John Watson, famously programmed
pigeons to perform elaborate actions—even guiding air-launched missiles to their targets
(a disturbing echo of recent AI) by giving them a particular schedule of rewards and
punishments. The essential idea was that actions that were rewarded would be repeated
and those that were punished would not, until the desired behavior was achieved. Even
in Skinner’s day, this simple process, repeated over and over, could lead to complex
behavior. Computers are designed to perform simple operations over and over on a scale
that dwarfs human imagination, and computational systems can learn remarkably
complex skills in this way.

For example, researchers at Google’s DeepMind used a combination of deep
learning and reinforcement learning to teach a computer to play Atari video games. The
computer knew nothing about how the games worked. It began by acting randomly and
got information only about what the screen looked like at each moment and how well it
had scored. Deep learning helped interpret the features on the screen, and reinforcement
learning rewarded the system for higher scores. The computer got very good at playing
several of the games, but it also completely bombed on others just as easy for humans to
master.

A similar combination of deep learning and reinforcement learning has enabled
the success of DeepMind’s AlphaZero, a program that managed to beat human players at
both chess and Go, equipped only with a basic knowledge of the rules of the game and

Mashtalyar
Brexit day or how does my algorithm react to large one-side
movements
Dear Jeffrey,
I was thinking how to better answer your question regarding risks associated with a large
opposite side movement against my algorithm’s logic. I decided to test-run Brexit day on
GBP/USD to provide you with a practical example of how my algorithm would react to a sudden
18 cents price movement down in a day*.
**Red lines represent open and close positions for short contracts. Blue lines represent open and close positions for long contracts.
As you can see from a picture above, pound was dropping for 7 consecutive hours from 1.50 to
1.32 against the dollar during Asian trading hours on June 24 th (during votes count in the UK).
Seven hours long 18 cents movements are extremely rare in currency markets. However, 3
cents movements are very common and can be predicted beforehand. For instance, currency
traders can expect increased volatility every time the Fed member speaks, U.S. releases
unemployment data, Draghi talks about QE efficiency, or elections take place. These days and
hours are well known beforehand. Professional and responsible investors must have case A
and B planned out before any influential data release.
*I can only test my algorithm for 24 hour timeframes from 00:00 to 23:59 of a day with my current hardware and
software, thus this particular example includes short trades opened before the 18 cent drop and they are working
well as a hedge.
While this particular example above illustrates good results by the end of the day (+$7,848 and
$1,600 maximum drawdown from starting balance), there are certainly markets situations that
require large margins and can not be expected beforehand. These are usually terrorist attacks,
sudden nature disasters, or even FOX News releasing FBI renewal investigation over Clinton
and following speculation on Trump’s lead prior U.S. elections.
The Brexit day example is certainly a good case scenario for my algorithm. It provides algorithm
with a large volatility and many profitable opportunities. However, there are other large one-side
price movements in financial markets that can destroy not only my model, but many other
trading strategies if wrong side position is held. In the last month financial markets experienced
pound flash-crash in the middle of a random night. GBP/USD dropped for about 10 cents in 2
minutes and jumped back. Many got rich and many got poor for 120 seconds while in their
sleep. The only thing that secures investments is responsible trading, which is placing stop
losses and not risking more than some percentage per trade.
As a CFA Candidate and a prospective algorithmic hedge-fund manager I cannot say investing
even in T-Bills is 100% safe and can only say currency trading involves high risk. The only thing
I can assure tell you (in my personal opinion) that $10,000 is a lowest safe responsible sum of
money needed to operate with the model where $5,000 is used for margin alone and $5,000 is
set to be used as a bad case scenario expected drawdown value or a stop loss.
P.S. Jeffrey, I want to introduce you to some algorithmic trading concepts and terms needed to
understand trading algorithms better.
• Algorithmic trading is highly dependent on statistics and averages over a long-term
history.
• Drawdown – maximal losing dollar amount for open or closed positions from starting
balance.
• Algorithm ceiling – largest amount of money an algorithm can work with (large trades can
influence market conditions against an algorithm).
• Percentage of profit and loss trades: 53.99% profit and 46.01% loss trades this summer
on a “back-test”
• Average profit trade: $20.74 this summer on a “back-test”
• Average loss trade: $14.13 this summer on a “back-test”
• Number of trades per time period: 45,221
P.P.S. Drawdown value for a condition where price goes down, my algorithm buys a long
contract every minute and does not hold short contracts can be estimated in the Excel file
attached to the email (Estimation of losing P&L).
2
Results of a scenario where a currency pair loses 0.0001 from 1.11 to 1.0741 (3.59 cents total)
every single minute for 360 consecutive minutes can be seen below. This is an extreme case
scenario of a pair losing its value for 6 consecutive hours without any retracement. Please, take
a note that duration and consistency of a price drop are much more important than the value a
drop itself.

nies collect and archive our phone usage “metadata,” which includes
whom we called and how long we spoke. When we use Google
to search for anyone or anything on the Internet, that activity is
captured by Google, a company whose profits mainly come from
making available to advertisers the results of its surveillance and

to allow Google to read the actual contents of our correspondence to
find keywords of interest to advertisers.

When we use a credit card, the credit card company also retains
data about what we buy and where we go. When we travel in auto-
mobiles equipped with GPS, every turn and stop is tracked and
recorded. And when we are in public places with CCTV (closed-
circuit television) cameras, our image is recorded and archived.

to turn a profit. Indeed, they may be more aptly called surveillance
media than social media. For those of us who use them to post pic-
tures and communicate, any notion of personal privacy is largely
illusory.

’ I've cited my tax professor's two fundamental laws of tax before: that it is always better to have more money than less money, and
that it is always better to die later than to die sooner. The second rule is always relevant in estate-tax situations too.

* I'm using yesterday for convenience but in fact you'd have to use today's valuation. And the stock is down again today!
° That is, 318.2 million shares times $0.61 per share times 40 percent is $77.6 million.
'° Now 317.3 million, I guess.

'| You shouldn't take that date too seriously; the foundation's June 11 filing stated an approximate date of sale of June 11, but it
actually took about two weeks. Best guess, the foundation was/is selling those shares yesterday and today.

© Do I even need to tell you that Simmons was a libertarian anti-tax advocate, had various run-ins with the IRS, and called President
Barack Obama the most dangerous man in America? Or that In 2009, a Dallas County jury found NL Industries -- one of the
companies in Simmons's estate -- liable for not honoring contractual agreements and manipulating stock values?

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030840.txt,"﻿Richard Madigan, Chief Investment Officer, J.P. Morgan Private Bank November 2012
A brief introduction (and a promise)
For those of you who don’t know me from my former
position as Chief Investment Officer of the Global Access
Portfolios, where I oversaw $16 billion in private and
institutional client assets, I want to briefly introduce
myself in my new role as Chief Investment Officer of the
J.P. Morgan Private Bank.
I’ve been part of the investment and strategy team at the
Private Bank since 2004, when I returned to the firm to work
with Michael Cembalest as he assembled a global strategy
team to work on behalf of private clients. I was responsible
for global multi-asset investment strategy and asset
allocation for our international clients before taking on the
role as CIO for Global Access.
During my time with Global Access, I wrote a regular
investment strategy note, Market Thoughts, which we sent to
clients globally. In my new role, I want to re-establish the
discipline of putting pen to paper around our market views:
what we are thinking, what we are seeing as core investment
themes, and how we are investing across global markets.
There is nothing more humbling than writing down and
clearly explaining what you think, and why, about the world
and markets. I have a well-established practice with our
family physician: I promise not to confuse him with
investment nonsense if he promises not to do the same with
medical gibberish. I promise the same clarity with
this note.
Same as it ever was
“Once in a Lifetime” is a song by the band Talking Heads. It
has come to mind repeatedly as I‘ve listened to the media
talk about the recent U.S. elections. There is a line in the
song that keeps repeating the phrase “same as it ever was,”
which seems to be, post-election, where we’ve landed.
The United States just ran a national election where an
estimated $6 billion was spent campaigning. The result
across Congress, state governorships and the presidential
popular vote was effectively a 50/50 split. Ironically, an
election this important is supposed to help bring
direction and clarity, and instead we have continued
short-term uncertainty. We believe that will translate
into a market that trends higher over the next 12 months,
but with air pockets.
Right now, the most important policy debate and air
pocket is around the fiscal cliff. The good and bad news is
we have to see movement in the next few months. There
isn’t a choice. The one thing that did ring clearly from the
U.S. election is the degree of frustration around partisan
bickering and policy inaction. This was Obama’s last
campaign, so he is playing for posterity. Congress recognizes
it is already playing to mid-term elections in 2014, and while
I never count on pragmatism from politicians, it’s actually in
everyone’s interest for the first time in three years to
work together. Everyone wins, and if not, has the other side
to blame come 2014.
Looking ahead
From a macro perspective, we believe the global
economy is bottoming, though we are likely to sit along
the bottom of a U-shaped recovery into early next year:
growing, but not yet inspiring. The immediate effects on
growth from Hurricane Sandy are going to need to be better
understood, along with how protracted a recession Europe is
facing. Markets reflect expectations, and already, data that is
less bad shows improved leading indicators, consumer
confidence and surprise indices. So less bad will eventually
be good; we simply need to see a trough in activity to lessen
market uncertainty.

market thoughts
Our core macro view remains that the global economy
continues to muddle through. We see U.S. growth between
+1.5% and 2.0%, Europe continuing to work its way out of
recession, and emerging economies growing +4%–5%, led
by China as growth moves to a more sustainable trend-like
+7%–8%. Global growth next year should be somewhere
between +2.5% and 3%.
China has just gone through a major political transition. We
expect the new Government to focus on reform initiatives
and inward investment. As my team in Hong Kong
continues to remind me, 7% growth feels pretty good.
There simply isn’t the sense of concern or urgency in
China as there has been outside the country around a
Chinese hard landing. It’s a domestic economy that is
maturing, which is exactly what we expect to see ahead.
With the U.S. election behind us, we believe there should be
little doubt across markets that until inflation becomes a
meaningful concern, central banks will continue to make
holding cash and core bonds frustrating for investors—slowly
pushing investors to take on incremental risk across markets.
But like deleveraging, increased risk taking needs to be a
process, not an event.
Fundamentals matter
I’m a pragmatist in life and as an investor, especially when
measuring and trying to understand risk. My team is very
much macro driven, and I believe in fundamentals (as a
parent, I have to). I like to have a view on both the upside
and downside of an investment. My favorite investment
ratio is 2:1, when thinking about the potential upsiderelative-to-downside,
and those investments are hard to
find. Credit has been one of them.
I recently challenged our quantitative research and analytics
team to help me think about the benefits and the risk in
portfolio diversification. We continue to have significant
investment tilts across our portfolios, and I wanted to make
sure we weren’t taking on additional risk because of a lack of
diversification. My intuition is that there is far less benefit
today than there has been traditionally in a set-it and forget-it
approach to asset allocation (something we don’t practice).
Let me also add that there is a tremendous difference
between an investor who is less diversified and one who is out
of the market, which continues to be painful for many
investors still on the sidelines.
The team looked back to 1991 at the correlation between
assets across world equity, bond, commodity and foreign
exchange markets. What we found is that correlation across
risk assets has been particularly high since the 2008
financial crisis. You get less benefit owning a little bit of
everything and a great deal more reward for being
disciplined and investing only where you see the most
value. What was even more interesting is that while some of
this is obviously cyclical, there appears to be a structural
pattern here as well.

Why is this relevant? Because it helps explain why we’ve
been comfortable barbelling the risk we’ve taken across
portfolios this year with a significant overweight to credit
markets; it’s allowed us to own less equities for similar
returns. Effectively, we’ve been able to take normal
levels of risk in portfolios but focus on the higher
certainty of those returns coming from yield rather than
more volatile equity price appreciation.
We still see fundamental value in our credit allocations, but
the return ahead is going to be driven by yield or the coupon,
not by bond price appreciation. I’m going to argue that it
places us right where we should be in the deleveraging and
global recovery cycle. It’s time to revisit the balance of how
we are taking risk in portfolios. If we want to achieve similar
portfolio returns next year, we’ll need to take more
directional risk where we see value across global markets.

market thoughts
The great rotation
There is an awful lot being written about the next bursting
bubble, which, according to pundits, is fixed income. The
fear is either that inflation very quickly begins to
reaccelerate because of monetary policy and central banks
will need to aggressively slam on the policy brakes, or that
investors are going to begin a Great Rotation out of fixed
income.
The Great Rotation scare being talked about argues that
individual investors will apparently all wake up one day and
collectively sell their bonds to buy stocks. For individual
investors, it’s very unlikely that we will see selling of core
bonds until investors actually lose money—and we don’t
expect that to happen soon. In our portfolios next year, we
envision owning more world equity markets, and owning
less cash and short-duration fixed income. So I agree with
the risk rotation, but a mad dash by individual investors out
of fixed income seems unnecessary and unlikely.
The balancing act for central banks is to try to stimulate
growth without provoking inflation. There is enough excess
capacity in labor markets that the greater policy concern
remains disinflationary pressure. While we are keeping a
close eye on inflation expectations, which have been
rising, our economics team continues to believe inflation
comes after growth and therefore isn’t a threat to this
cycle of easy monetary policy. We expect the Fed,
European Central Bank and Bank of Japan will continue to
promote “easy money.”
There is going to be an inflation shock that will come with
accelerating growth—we just don’t see it next year. But in
preparation for that scenario, our team has already begun to
do work on the theme of inflation protection.

Now what?
We invest with a 12-month outlook, but also take advantage
of short-term trading opportunities. But to borrow a phrase
from my daughter, patience is the key to joy. Into year-end,
markets face higher uncertainty and weaker activity. We are
going to see more headlines, unfortunately with less real
news. In the short term, both issues will extract a higher risk
premia from risk assets, which should create some
interesting opportunities.
For where we believe the macro cycle is right now, we
want to be increasing our allocation to equities as we look
into 2013. We continue to barbell those equity allocations
between the United States, which continues to lead the global
recovery, and emerging markets, where we see significant
growth potential. While we have added to our exposure in
Europe and continue to see scope for investment opportunity
ahead, we don’t feel it’s a market that is gapping away from us.
We are also doing tactical work in our hedge fund allocations.
We are looking to be more directional in our risk taking
next year, particularly looking at long/short and eventdriven
strategies. In fixed income, we continue to like
credit, but need to be more selective. We are looking at
total and absolute return fixed income strategies that can be
more nimble in how they invest duration. We expect to hold
less short-duration and cash next year across portfolios.
As a last mention, for anyone looking for a timely read, I just
finished William Silber’s book about Paul Volcker. It is great
context for how we got to where we are today and a
reminder that while the past doesn’t ever exactly repeat
itself, it does rhyme. It’s also a subtle reminder of why
strong leadership and bipartisan counsel are essential for
effectively navigating the road ahead.
I very much look forward to our ongoing investment
dialogue with you.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020062.txt,"Among Bannon’s many regular targets, Powell had become a favorite. She was often
billed as Deputy National Security Advisor; that was her sometime designation even in the
New York Times. Actually, she was Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategy—the
difference, Bannon pointed out, between the COO of a hotel chain and the concierge.

Coming back from the overseas trip, Powell began to talk in earnest to friends about
her timetable to get out of the White House and back into a private-sector job. Sheryl
Sandberg, she said, was her model.

“Oh my fucking god,” said Bannon.

On May 26, the day before the presidential party returned from the overseas trip, the
Washington Post reported that during the transition, Kushner and Sergey Kislyak, the
Russian ambassador, had, at Kushner’s instigation, discussed the possibility of having the
Russians set up a private communications channel between the transition team and the
Kremlin. The Post cited “U.S. officials briefed on intelligence reports.” The Jarvanka side
believed that Bannon was the source.

Part of the by now deep enmity between the First Family couple and their allies and
Bannon and his team was the Jarvanka conviction that Bannon had played a part in many
of the reports of Kushner’s interactions with the Russians. This was not, in other words,
merely an internal policy war; it was a death match. For Bannon to live, Kushner would
have to be wholly discredited—pilloried, investigated, possibly even jailed.

Bannon, assured by everyone that there was no winning against the Trump family,
hardly tried to hide his satisfied belief that he was going to outplay them. In the Oval
Office, in front of her father, Bannon openly attacked her. “You,” he said, pointing at her
as the president watched, “are a fucking liar.” Ivanka’s bitter complaints to her father,
which in the past had diminished Bannon, were now met by a hands-off Trump: “TI told
you this is a tough town, baby.”

OOK Ok

But if Bannon was back, it was far from clear what being back meant. Trump being
Trump, was this true rehabilitation, or did he feel an even deeper rancor toward Bannon
for having survived his initial intention to kill him? Nobody really thought Trump forgot
—instead, he dwelled and ruminated and chewed. “One of the worst things is when he
believes you’ve succeeded at his expense,” explained Sam Nunberg, once on the inside of
the Trump circle, then cast to the outside. “If your win is in any way perceived as his loss,
phew.”

For his part, Bannon believed he was back because, at a pivotal moment, his advice
had proved vastly better than that of the “geniuses.” Firing Comey, the solve-all-problems
Jarvanka solution, had indeed unleashed a set of terrible consequences.

The Jarvanka side believed that Bannon was in essence blackmailing the president. As

Never automate something that can be eliminated, and never delegate something that can be automated
or streamlined. Otherwise, you waste someone else’s time instead of your own, which now wastes your
hard-earned cash. How’s that for incentive to be effective and efficient’? Now you're playing with your
own dough. It’s something I want you to get comfortable with, and this baby step is small stakes.

Did I mention to eliminate before you delegate?

For example, it is popular among executives to have assistants read e-mail. In some cases this is
valuable. In my case, I use spam filters, autoresponders with FAQs, and automatic forwarding to
outsourcers to limit my e-mail obligation to 10-20 e-mail responses per week. It takes me 30 minutes per
week because I used systems—elimination and automation—to make it so.

Nor do I use an assistant to set meetings and conference calls because I have eliminated meetings. If I
need to set the odd 20-minute call for a given month, [ll send one two-sentence e-mail and be done
with it.

Principle number one is to refine rules and processes before adding people. Using people to leverage a
refined process multiplies production; using people as a solution to a poor process multiplies problems.

The Menu: A World of Possibilities

I am not interested in picking up crumbs of compassion thrown from the table of someone who
considers himself my master. I want the full menu of rights.

— BISHOP DESMOND TUTU, South African cleric and activist

Tae next question then becomes, “What should you delegate?” It’s a good question, but I don’t want

to answer it. I want to watch Family Guy.

The truth be told, it is a hell of a lot of work writing about not working. Ritika of Brickwork and
Venky of YMII are more than capable of writing this section, so ll just mention two guidelines and
leave the mental hernia of detail work to them.

Golden Rule #1: Each delegated task must be both time-consuming and well-defined. If you’re
running around like a chicken with its head cut off and assign your VA to do that for you, it doesn’t
improve the order of the universe.

Golden Rule #2: On a lighter note, have some fun with it. Have someone in Bangalore or Shanghai
send e-mails to friends as your personal concierge to set lunch dates or similar basics. Harass your
boss with odd phone calls in strong accents from unknown numbers. Being effective doesn’t mean
being serious all the time. It’s fun being in control for a change. Get a bit of repression off your chest
so it doesn’t turn into a complex later.

The science of eliciting false confessions: the case of Jonathan Doody

Another murder case that never seems to end involves a man named Jonathan Doody, the son of a
Thai mother and an American soldier, who was accused of the mass murder of nine Buddhist
Monks and nuns in Arizona back in 1991. They were placed on the floor in a circle and
systematically shot in the head, apparently by a group of armed robbers. Originally, a motorcycle
gang was suspected of the crime. After a lengthy interrogation, four of them confessed, but it
soon became clear to the police that they had been pressured into making false confessions and
they were freed.

Doody, who was 1_ at the time, was then arrested and subjected to a similarly pressured 12 hour
interrogation. The police began by giving him his Miranda warnings: you have the right to
counsel; you have the right to remain silent; and anything you say can and will be used against you
in the court. They then proceeded, gradually, to “demirandize” him, by taking back everything
they had originally said! You have a right to an attorney “if you were involved in [the murders]”;
anything you “tell us” is “gonna stay right here” and not be used “in court;” and “you just have to
open up” —that is confess—and we will keep you here until you do. Finally, the exhausted _
year old confessed to being involved with the motorcycle gang—which the police knew was
untrue—and to participating in the killings. Based largely on this questionable confession, he was
convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.

When I first became involved in the case, I decided to do my own investigation. The murder
scene was near a United States Airbase and I learned that Russia was selling some of the Soviet
Union’s old satellite photographs of the United States. I bought the photographs for the day and
location of the murder in the hope that perhaps they might show evidence that people other than
Doody were responsible for the crime. Unfortunately, the sky was overcast that day and the
photographs were useless. We would have to limit ourselves to making arguments based on the
record of the trial, with an emphasis on how the police had elicited the confession from Doody. I
did extensive research on the “science”—or “art”—of eliciting confessions from reluctant
suspects. I learned how the interrogators place objects from the crime scene in view of the
suspect, how they suggest answers, how they create an atmosphere of intimidation and
omniscience, and how they contrive to turn the Miranda warnings to their own advantage.

I argued the initial appeal, along my brother Nathan’s office in 19__. The Arizona Supreme
Court affirmed the conviction. My brother’s partner, Victoria Eiger, then took prime
responsibility for preparing a federal writ of habeus corpus. My brother and I worked closely
with her. The matter simply sat before the federal judge for ___ years, before she rendereda___
page decision denying relief. We then appealed the denial to a panel of the United States Court of
Appeals for the 9 Circuit, which reversed Doody’s conviction in a 2-1 decision that ruled his
confession involuntary and ordered him to be freed, unless the state granted him a new trial. The
state then appealed the reversal to the entire 9 Circuit, which set the case down for argument
before 11 judges. They also ruled in Doody’s favor by a vote of 9-3. Still the case was not over.
The state sought a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court which remanded the case back to
the 9 Circuit for reconsideration in light of a recent Supreme Court decision. The 9 Circuit
reconsidered and once again threw out Doody’s conviction on the ground that the confession was

king, gets up, and leaves the room. Kasparov has resigned, Deep Blue has
beaten him 3% to 2% points and is now the most powerful chess player
on the planet.

Later, when interviewed about his experience, Kasparov thought
Deep Blue must have been assisted by humans during the games because
the program appeared to play intuitively. The rules of the tournament
allowed humans to work on the program between matches, but not
during actual play. The argument has never been settled, and Deep
Blue was long ago dismantled. These days chess players avoid big public
matches against computers, arguing it is really a different sort of game.
A computer’s ability to crunch mathematically through all the many
possibilities means a chess player must play without error against a
machine, but can play a more interesting and fluid match against a fellow
human.

Chess is computer-friendly because it is a finite problem. You always
win, lose or draw. The game can't go on forever because any position that
repeats itself more than three times is declared a draw, and if a player
makes 50 moves without moving a pawn or taking a piece, the game
is also declared a draw. In a typical game, each player makes 40 moves,
and on each turn you can choose from 30 possible moves. Although this
equates to a huge number of options, it is still a finite number.

It is possible, therefore, to create a perfect chess-playing machine.
Such a machine would project any position it encountered through
every permutation to the endgame. But, although chess is solvable using
brute force this might not be practical in our Universe. The storage
required to hold all the possible positions being analyzed would be
vast — needing most of the atoms in the Universe. You would need to
pack this information into a small enough space to allow fast retrieval in
order to play the first 40 moves in two hours. This would require storing
all the information within a sphere no larger than three light minutes.
Putting that much data in such a small space would exceed the Hawking
Bekenstein bound - a limit on the information carrying capacity of
space-time put forward by Stephen Hawking and Jacob Bekenstein
— causing the region of space-time to collapse to a black hole! Despite
these minor technical problems, an ingenious algorithm could be made
that was unbeatable: chess is essentially computable.

The term algorithm will often arise in the book, so it is worth giving
a little history. The word comes from the name of an 8 Century Persian
mathematician, Al-Khwarizmi, and means a step-by-step procedure. We
use one whenever we do long division or look up a phone number on

Some have taken a less sanguine view, arguing
that the “taper tantrum” of 2013 suggests bond
yields have already reached a troublesome level for
stocks. However, the tantrum primarily reflected
concerns that by tightening policy prematurely, the
Federal Reserve was committing a mistake that
would undermine growth—a fact evident in the
episode’s widening credit spreads and declining
breakeven inflation rates. Despite a similarly
rapid increase in rates this time around, we have
seen the opposite market reaction, with credit
spreads tightening and breakeven inflation rates
moving higher alongside growth expectations.
This contrast reminds us that the reason rates are
increasing is as important as their resulting level.

Aside from rates, ongoing concern about a
hard landing in China and a banking or political
crisis in Europe remain top of mind (see Section
I, The Risks to Our Outlook}. We also start the

developments, given today’s high valuations. Even

We are working on getting the following article placed in the Hill or the Politico within the next week. As of now it looks
like former Chairman of Armed Services, Congressman Ron Dellums, will be the author. Please keep highly

confidential. Will keep you posted on if, when and where it gets published. Once it is published we can all circulate it
highly. We believe that this article sets the tone for the advocacy we will be doing and having someone very prominent
like Congressman Dellums will also be a great way to launch this campaign.

Congressman Ronald Dellums is a thirteen term Member of the U.S. House of Representatives (D-CA) who
served from 1971-1998. He also served as the 48th Mayor of Oakland from 2007-2011. Dellums served as the
Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and the House Committee on the District of Columbia. He
also served on the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Post Office and Civil Service Committee, the Permanent
Select Committee on Intelligence and co-founded the Congressional Black Caucus.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016827.txt,"In the 1980s, Judea Pearl introduced a new approach to artificial intelligence called
Bayesian networks. This probability-based model of machine reasoning enabled
machines to function—in a complex and uncertain world—as “evidence engines,’
continuously revising their beliefs in light of new evidence.

Within a few years, Judea’s Bayesian networks had completely overshadowed the
previous rule-based approaches to artificial intelligence. The advent of deep learning—
in which computers, in effect, teach themselves to be smarter by observing tons of data,
has given him pause, because this method lacks transparency.

While recognizing the impressive achievements in deep learning by colleagues
such as Michael Jordan and Geoffrey Hinton, he feels uncomfortable with this kind of
opacity. He set out to understand the theoretical limitations of deep-learning systems
and points out that basic barriers exist that will prevent them from achieving a human
kind of intelligence, no matter what we do. Leveraging the computational benefits of
Bayesian networks, Judea realized that the combination of simple graphical models and
data could also be used to represent and infer cause-effect relationships. The
significance of this discovery far transcends its roots in artificial intelligence. His latest
book explains causal thinking to the general public; you might say it is a primer on how
to think even though human.

Judea’s principled, mathematical approach to causality is a profound
contribution to the realm of ideas. It has already benefited virtually every field of
inquiry, especially the data-intensive health and social sciences.

famously indifferent to the suffering of its own people. The Ayatollah also
doesn't seem to take the Administration's talk about all options being on
the table seriously. Mr. Obama's nomination of Iran dove Chuck Hagel to
be Secretary of Defense reinforces that impression, as do reports that the
White House blocked Pentagon and CIA plans to arm the opposition that's
fighting to overthrow Iran's client regime in Damascus. An America that
won't help proxies in a proxy war isn't likely to take the fight directly to
Iran's nuclear facilities.

In rejecting Mr. Biden's offer, the Ayatollah said frankly, I'm not a
diplomat; I'm a revolutionary. Another round of multilateral talks with
Iran is set to resume this month, but maybe Joe Biden and his boss should
start taking no for an answer.

Let's face it: Obama's Iran policy ts failing

James Traub

February 8, 2013 -- There is no better example of an Obama
administration initiative that has succeeded on its own terms, and yet
failed as policy, than Iran. By engaging the regime in Tehran, and being
rebuffed, the White House has been able to enlist China, Russia, and the
European Union in imposing tough sanctions on Iran. By steadily
ratcheting up those sanctions, the administration has been able to
gradually squeeze the Iranian economy. By insisting that containment is
not an option, Obama has persuaded Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu that he need not launch an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities --
at least not any time soon.

superficial: a few words across a market stall or a restaurant counter. I did not
pretend to myself that our Arab neighbors were now suddenly inclined to be our
friends.

But I did feel that, having come face-to-face with our overwhelming military
supremacy, the Arab states would, over time, grant Israel simple acceptance.
From there, I believed that we could begin the process of building genuine,
lasting, human relationships and, eventually, peace.

There was a brief period after the war when Eshkol cautioned his ministers
about the implications of holding on to the vast new area we had conquered.
The government formally agreed to treat most of it, with the exception of
Jerusalem, as a “deposit” to be traded for the opening of peace talks. Yet within
weeks, the emphasis in the Israeli political debate shifted to which parts we
would keep: the Sinai and the Golan almost certainly, as well as the Jordan
Valley and a number of areas of past Jewish settlement on the West Bank. The
drift away from any serious talk of trading land for peace was accelerated by the
Arab states’ response to the war. Perhaps that, too, was simply a matter of
human nature, a reluctance on their part to accept defeat. But they appeared no
more ready than before to contemplate peace. Throughout the summer, there
were clashes along our new “border” with Egypt: the Suez Canal. In September,
all the Arab states adopted a platform which became known as the “three no’s”.
They rejected not just the idea of peace, but peace talks, or recognition of the
State of Israel. And in October, Egyptian missile boats attacked and sunk Israel’s
largest warship, the destroyer Eilat, killing nearly 50 people on board.

Without this renewed violence, perhaps, we in Israel might have been able to
consider more deeply the future implications of our victory in the Six-Day War.
The gains on the battlefield, of course, were clear to everyone. We were no
longer a small, constricted country beset by a sense of vulnerability. We were
not only much bigger, but also stronger than the combined armies of the Arab
states. Still, very few people asked themselves at the time what kind of Israel
this implied. We failed to grasp the potential complications in holding on to all

• In the near term, the most likely source of a domestic shock is the fallout from one of the
investigations—by multiple state attorneys general and the House of Representatives—of President
Trump.
• The ebb and flow of these investigations will inevitably lead to great market volatility. But there is
greater likelihood that exogenous shocks will come from external sources, rather than domestic ones.

“The Three Principal Players Have Different Perspectives”

Management
Division
National Security Advisor John Bolton
• “Bolton wants a crisis. He hopes to use the pressure as a maximum containment strategy to cripple the
Iranian economy, increasing domestic opposition to the government, and making regime change more
likely.
• … ‘forcing’ the Americans to engage in military intervention for Bolton [is] a useful pretext to bombing
key nuclear facilities that would set the Iranian program back years or more.”
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
• “Pompeo wants the band back together. He doesn’t believe the United States can credibly induce the
Iranians towards a more constructive posture by themselves, and accordingly wants a tougher, common
front to force better terms from Iran from a position of strength.
• Pompeo hopes the Europeans and other allies will be more supportive of broader American pressure
against Iran, and a multilateral coalition can come back together.”
President Trump
• “President Trump wants a breakthrough on his terms. He wants to use American power to force the
Iranians into direct negotiations, and pull off a better agreement than Obama did.”

• US oil production growth has matched or exceeded global demand growth over the past year, providing ample supplies
to the market.
• In fact, OPEC had to cut production in late 2018 in order to reduce oversupply and arrest a fast decline in oil prices.
• OPEC production could be increased back to 2018 highs if the market faced a shortage. Doing so would add 1.7 million

• The immediate threat of military engagement between the US and Iran has eased but risk of escalation
or miscalculation is high.
• US agenda (and the impact of Saudi Arabia and Israel) is unclear, with administration officials offering
contradictory views.
• Iran is set to resume its nuclear program with the intent of gaining leverage for future negotiations
which it previously relinquished as part of the JCPOA.
• There is further potential downside for Iranian oil production and exports, but ample OECD
inventories, growing US production, and OPEC spare capacity would help contain any short-term oil
price shock.
• We continue to recommend that clients stay invested at their full strategic asset allocation given
today’s macroeconomic backdrop and low odds of a recession, but we remain vigilant about the risks
to our outlook.

Disclosures
Important Information – Investment Risks
Investment
Management
Division
Risks vary by the type of investment. For example, investments that involve futures, equity swaps, and other derivatives, as well as non-investment grade
securities, give rise to substantial risk and are not available to or suitable for all investors. We have described some of the risks associated with certain
investments below. Additional information regarding risks may be available in the materials provided in connection with specific investments. You should not
enter into a transaction or make an investment unless you understand the terms of the transaction or investment and the nature and extent of the associated
risks. You should also be satisfied that the investment is appropriate for you in light of your circumstances and financial condition.
Any reference to a specific company or security is not intended to form the basis for an investment decision and are included solely to provide examples or
provide additional context. This information should not be construed as research or investment advice and should not be relied upon in whole or in part in
making an investment decision. Goldman Sachs, or persons involved in the preparation or issuance of these materials, may from time to time have long or
short positions in, buy or sell (on a principal basis or otherwise), and act as market makers in, the securities or options, or serve as a director of any companies
mentioned herein.
Alternative Investments. Alternative investments may involve a substantial degree of risk, including the risk of total loss of an investor’s capital and the use of
leverage, and therefore may not be appropriate for all investors. Private equity, private real estate, hedge funds and other alternative investments structured as
private investment funds are subject to less regulation than other types of pooled vehicles and liquidity may be limited. Investors in private investment funds
should review the Offering Memorandum, the Subscription Agreement and any other applicable disclosures for risks and potential conflicts of interest. Terms
and conditions governing private investments are contained in the applicable offering documents, which also include information regarding the liquidity of
such investments, which may be limited.
Commodities. Commodity investments may be less liquid and more volatile than other investments. The risk of loss in trading commodities can be substantial
due, but not limited to, volatile political, market and economic conditions. An investor’s returns may change radically at any time since commodities are
subject, by nature, to abrupt changes in price. Commodity prices are volatile because they respond to many unpredictable factors including weather, labor
strikes, inflation, foreign exchange rates, etc. In an individual account, because your position is leveraged, a small move against your position may result in a
large loss. Losses may be larger than your initial deposit. Investors should carefully consider the inherent risk of such an investment in light of their
experience, objectives, financial resources and other circumstances. No representation is made regarding the suitability of commodity investments.

Management
Division
Currencies. Currency exchange rates can be extremely volatile, particularly during times of political or economic uncertainty. There is a risk of loss when an
investor as exposure to foreign currency or are in foreign currency traded investments.
Derivatives. Investments that involve futures, equity swaps, and other derivatives give rise to substantial risk and are not available to or suitable for all
investors.
Emerging Markets and Growth Markets. Investing in the securities of issuers in emerging markets and growth markets involves certain considerations,
including: political and economic conditions, the potential difficulty of repatriating funds or enforcing contractual or other legal rights, and the small size of
the securities markets in such countries coupled with a low volume of trading, resulting in potential lack of liquidity and in price volatility.
Equity Investments. Equity investments are subject to market risk, which means that the value of the securities may go up or down in respect to the prospects
of individual companies, particular industry sectors and/or general economic conditions. The securities of small and mid-capitalization companies involve
greater risks than those associated with larger, more established companies and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements.
Fixed Income. Investments in fixed income securities are subject to the risks associated with debt securities generally, including credit/default, liquidity and
interest rate risk. Any guarantee on an investment grade bond of a given country applies only if held to maturity.
Futures. Security futures involve a high degree of risk and are not suitable for all investors. The possibility exists that an investor could lose a substantial
amount of money in a very short period of time because security futures are highly leveraged. The amount they could lose is potentially unlimited and can
exceed the amount they originally deposited with your firm. Prior to buying a security future you must receive a copy of the Risk Disclosure Statement for
Security Futures Contracts.
Non-US Securities. Investing in non-US securities involves the risk of loss as a result of more or less non-US government regulation, less public information,
less liquidity and greater volatility in the countries of domicile of the issuers of the securities and/ or the jurisdiction in which these securities are traded. In
addition, investors in securities such as ADRs/ GDRs, whose values are influenced by foreign currencies, effectively assume currency risk.
Options. Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Options investors may lose the entire amount of their investment in a relatively short
period of time. Before entering into any options transaction, be sure to read and understand the current Options Disclosure Document entitled, The
Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options. This booklet can be obtained at http://www. theocc.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp.

• Alternative Investments. Alternative investments may involve a substantial degree of risk, including the risk of total loss of an investor’s capital and the use of leverage, and may not be
appropriate for all investors. Private equity, private real estate, hedge funds, and other alternative investments structured as private investment funds are subject to less regulation than other types
of pooled vehicles and liquidity may be limited. You should review the Offering Memorandum, the Subscription Agreement, and any other applicable offering documents for risks, potential conflicts
of interest, terms and conditions and other disclosures.
• Commodities. Commodity investments may be less liquid and more volatile than other investments. The risk of loss in trading commodities can be substantial due, but not limited, to volatile
political, market and economic conditions. An investor’s returns may change radically at any time since commodities are subject to abrupt changes in price. Commodity prices are volatile because
they respond to many unpredictable factors including weather, labor strikes, inflation, foreign exchange rates, etc. In a single account, because your position is leveraged, a small move against
your position may result in a large loss. Losses may be larger than your initial deposit. No representation is made regarding the suitability of commodity investments.
• Currencies. Currency exchange rates can be extremely volatile, particularly during times of political or economic uncertainty. There is a risk of loss when an investor has exposure to foreign
currency or holds foreign currency traded investments.
• Over-the-Counter (“OTC”) Derivatives You should carefully review the Master Agreement, including any related schedules, credit support documents, addenda and exhibits. You may be
requested to post margin or collateral at levels consistent with the internal policies of GS to support written OTC derivatives. Prior to entering into an OTC derivative transaction you should be
aware of the below general risks associated with OTC derivative transactions:
- Liquidity Risk: There is no public market for OTC derivative transactions and, therefore, it may be difficult or impossible to liquidate an existing position on favorable terms.
21
Important Information
Investment
Management
Division
- Risk of Inability to Assign: OTC derivative transactions entered into with one or more affiliates of Goldman Sachs cannot be assigned or otherwise transferred without Goldman Sachs’ prior
written consent and, therefore, it may be impossible for you to transfer any OTC derivative transaction to a third party.
- Counterparty Credit Risk: Because Goldman Sachs may be obligated to make substantial payments to you as a condition of an OTC derivative transaction, you must evaluate the credit risk of
doing business with Goldman Sachs. Depending on the type of transaction, your counterparty may be Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, a registered U.S. broker-dealer, or other affiliate of The
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. As a broker dealer regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC is subject to net capital, financial responsibility
rules, and other regulatory requirements designed to protect customer assets. Other subsidiaries of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. may not be registered as a U.S. broker dealer and
therefore are not be subject to similar SEC regulation.
- Pricing and Valuation: The price of each OTC derivative transaction is individually negotiated between Goldman Sachs and each counterparty and Goldman Sachs does not represent or
warrant that the prices for which it offers OTC derivative transactions are the best prices available. You may therefore have trouble establishing whether the price you have been offered for a
particular OTC derivative transaction is fair. OTC derivatives may trade at a value that is different from the level inferred from interest rates, dividends and the underlyer. The difference may
be due to factors including, but not limited to, expectations of future levels of interest rates and dividends, and the volatility of the underlyer prior to maturity. The market price of the OTC
derivative transaction may be influenced by many unpredictable factors, including economic conditions, the creditworthiness of Goldman Sachs, the value of any underlyers, and certain
actions taken by Goldman Sachs.
- Early Termination Payments: The provisions of an OTC derivative transaction may allow for early termination and, in such cases, either you or Goldman Sachs may be required to make a
potentially significant termination payment depending upon whether the OTC derivative transaction is in-the-money at the time of termination.
- Indexes: Goldman Sachs does not warrant, and takes no responsibility for, the structure, method of computation or publication of any currency exchange rates, interest rates, indexes of such
rates, or credit, equity or other indexes, unless Goldman Sachs specifically advises you otherwise.
• Emerging Markets and Growth Markets. Emerging markets and growth markets investments involve certain considerations, including political and economic conditions, the potential difficulty of
repatriating funds or enforcing contractual or other legal rights, and the small size of the securities markets in such countries coupled with a low volume of trading, resulting in potential lack of
liquidity and price volatility.
• Equity Investments. Equity investments are subject to market risk. The value of the securities may go up or down in respect to the prospects of individual companies, particular industry sectors
and/or general economic conditions. The securities of small and mid-capitalization companies involve greater risks than those associated with larger, more established companies and may be
subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements.
• Fixed Income. Fixed income securities investments are subject to the risks associated with debt securities generally, including credit/default, liquidity and interest rate risk. Any guarantee on an
investment grade bond of a given country applies only if held to maturity.
• Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs). MLPs may be generally less liquid than other publicly traded securities and as such can be more volatile and involve higher risk. MLPs may also involve
substantially different tax treatment than other equity-type investments, and such tax treatment could be disadvantageous to certain types of retirement accounts or charitable entities.
• Money Market Funds. Money market fund investments are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although money market
funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money.
• Non-US Securities. Non-US securities investments involve the risk of loss as a result of more or less non-US government regulation, less public information, less liquidity, and greater volatility in
the countries of domicile of the issuers of the securities and/or the jurisdiction in which these securities are traded. In addition, investors in securities such as ADRs/GDRs, whose values are
influenced by foreign currencies, effectively assume currency risk.
• Options. Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. The purchase of options can result in the loss of an entire investment and the risk of uncovered options is potentially unlimited.
You must read and understand the current Options Disclosure Document before entering into any options transactions. The booklet entitled Characteristics and Risk of Standardized Options can
be obtained from your PWM team or at http://www.theocc.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. A secondary market may not be available for all options. Transaction costs may be significant
in option strategies that require multiple purchases and sales of options, such as spreads. Supporting documentation for any comparisons, recommendations, statistics, technical data, or other
information will be supplied upon request.
• Real Estate. Real estate investments involve additional risks not typically associated with other asset classes, such as sensitivities to temporary or permanent reductions in property values for the
geographic region(s) represented. Real estate investments (both through public and private markets) are also subject to changes in broader macroeconomic conditions, such as interest rates.
22
Important Information
Investment
Management

• Structured Investments. Structured investments are complex, involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Investors in structured investments assume the credit risk of the issuer or
guarantor. If the issuer or guarantor defaults, you may lose your entire investment, even if you hold the product to maturity. Structured investments often perform differently from the asset(s) they
reference. Credit ratings may pertain to the credit rating of the issuer and are not indicative of the market risk associated with the structured investment or the reference asset. Each structured
investment is different, and for each investment you should consider 1) the possibility that at expiration you may be forced to own the reference asset at a depressed price; 2) limits on the ability to
share in upside appreciation; 3) the potential for increased losses if the reference asset declines; and 4) potential inability to sell given the lack of a public trading market.
• Tactical Tilts. Tactical tilts may involve a high degree of risk. No assurance can be made that profits will be achieved or that substantial losses will not be incurred. Prior to investing, you must
determine whether a particular tactical tilt is suitable for them.
• U.S. Registered Mutual Funds / Exchange Traded Funds (“ETFs”) or Exchange Traded Notes (“ETNs”). You should consider a fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses,
and read the summary prospectus and/or the Prospectus (which may be obtained from your PWM Team) carefully before investing, as they contain this and other relevant information. You may
obtain documents for ETFs or ETNs for free by 1) visiting EDGAR on the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/; 2) contacting your PWM team; or 3) calling toll-free at 1-866-471-2526. Unlike
traditional mutual funds, ETFs can trade at a discount or premium to the net asset value and are not directly redeemable by the fund. Leveraged or inverse ETFs, ETNs, or commodities futureslinked
ETFs may experience greater price movements than traditional ETFs and may not be appropriate for all investors. Most leveraged and inverse ETFs or ETNs seek to deliver multiples of the
performance (or the inverse of the performance) of the underlying index or benchmark on a daily basis. Their performance over a longer period of time can vary significantly from the stated daily
performance objectives or the underlying benchmark or index due to the effects of compounding. Performance differences may be magnified in a volatile market. ETFs are redeemable only in
Creation Unit size aggregations and may not be individually redeemed; are redeemable only through Authorized Participants; and are redeemable on an in-kind basis. The public trading price of
a redeemable lot of the ETFs may be different from its net asset value. These ETFs can trade at a discount or premium to the net asset value. There is always a fundamental risk of declining
stock prices, which can cause losses to your investment. Commodities futures-linked ETFs may perform differently than the spot price for the commodity itself, including due to the entering into
and liquidating of futures or swap contracts on a continuous basis to maintain exposure (i.e., “rolling”) and disparities between near term future prices and long term future prices for the underlying
commodity. ETFs and ETNs linked to commodity futures do not offer direct exposure to the commodity’s spot price and may perform differently than the spot price for the commodity itself.
Performance differential can be magnified if a specific condition persists in the market for a commodity that creates a disparity between near-term future prices and long-term future prices and
may lead to unexpected performance results. Other factors, such as roll yield, transaction costs, management fees, and taxes may cause deviation in performance between the spot price of a
commodity and commodity futures. You should not assume that a commodity-futures linked ETF will provide an effective hedge against other risks in your portfolio.

Assets Held at a Third Party Custodian. Any information (including valuation) regarding holdings and activity in accounts held by third party custodians is for your convenience and has been
supplied by third parties or by you. GS assumes no responsibility for the accuracy of such information. Information may vary from that reflected by your custodian and is as of the date of the materials

information, or provide advice. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, we have not assessed whether those investments fit within your investment objective and the asset classification shown may not be
accurate.
Off-Platform Investments. To the extent you ask us for guidance in connection with investment opportunities not offered by GS, such as investments in private funds, private debt or equity, real
estate or other opportunities you source away from us, any such guidance, views, or other information we may provide is on an accommodation basis only and we will not be acting as your advisor.
We assume no obligation to determine whether the opportunity is suitable for you in connection with such investment decisions and will not assume any liability for such investment decisions. Please
review our Form ADV for information on conflicts of interest we may have in connection with any such requests.
ISG/GIR Forecasts. Economic and market forecasts presented (“forecasts”) reflect either ISG’s or GIR’s views and are subject to change without notice. Forecasts do not take into account specific
investment objectives, restrictions, tax and financial situation or other needs of any specific client. Forecasts are subject to high levels of uncertainty that may affect actual performance and should be
viewed as merely representative of a broad range of possible outcomes. Forecasts and any return expectations are as of the date of this material, and should not be taken as an indication or
projection of returns of any given investment or strategy. Forecasts are estimated, based on capital market assumptions, and are subject to significant revision and may change materially as
economic and market conditions change. Any case studies and examples are for illustrative purposes only. If applicable, a copy of the GIR Report used for GIR forecasts is available upon request.
Forecasts do not reflect advisory fees, transaction costs, and other expenses a client would have paid, which would reduce return.

Performance / Estimated Income / Estimated Cash Flow. Past performance is not a guide of future results and may include investments no longer owned in current or closed accounts. Current
performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. To request the most current or historical performance data, or asset classification schema information, please contact your
PWM team at the number provided on your monthly statement or toll-free in the U.S. at 1-800-323-5678. Performance reports, where shown, generally present the relevant time weighted
performance, which is a combination of daily returns compounded over a specified time period with the removal of the deposit and withdrawal impacts, and may show internal rate of return
calculations where requested. Aggregate performance may not equal the sum of returns at an investment level. Performance for advisory accounts is currently calculated net of any management fees
and might include investments for which actual market prices are not currently available, and does not include private equity positions. Performance for alternative investments is calculated using the
value of the last available partnership capital statement or NAV. If included, estimated income figures and estimated private equity future cash flows are estimates of future activity, and actual results
may vary substantially. GS&Co. has adjusted performance calculations for certain asset classes or strategies and may do so in the future. Performance of net cash (i.e., cash less margin debit) is
generally included in the total performance calculation but not displayed separately. Option performance is included in the performance of the asset class of the underlier. Margin loans are generally
excluded from advisory performance but included in brokerage performance calculations. Mutual fund and ETF investment returns and the principal value of your investment will fluctuate. As a result,
your shares when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost. The performance data for ETFs does not reflect a deduction for commissions that would reduce the displayed
performance. You are not subject to a sales charge for mutual funds purchased through PWM. If a sales charge were applicable, the sales charge would reduce the mutual fund’s performance.
Information on our asset classification schema is available upon request. Generally, total returns are pre-tax and are calculated using daily time-weighted returns in which cash and securities
deposits are attributed to the beginning of the day and cash and securities withdrawals are attributed to the end of the day.
Indices / Benchmarks. Any references to indices, benchmarks, or other measure of relative market performance over a specified period of time are provided for your information only and is not
indicative of future results. In addition to the benchmark assigned to a specific investment strategy, other benchmarks (“Comparative Benchmarks”) may be displayed, including ones displayed at your
request. Managers may not review the performance of your account against the performance of Comparative Benchmarks. There is no guarantee that performance will equal or exceed any
benchmark displayed. Where a benchmark for a strategy has changed, the historical benchmark(s) are available upon request. Inception to date (“ITD”) returns and benchmark / reference portfolio
returns may reflect different periods. ITD returns for accounts or asset classes only reflect performance during periods in which your account(s) held assets and / or were invested in the asset class.
The benchmark or reference portfolio returns shown reflect the benchmark / portfolio performance from the date of inception of your account or your initial investment in the asset class. If displayed,
estimated income figures are estimates of future activity obtained from third party sources.
Indices are unmanaged. The figures for the index reflect the reinvestment of all income or dividends, as applicable, but do not reflect the deduction of any fees or expenses which would reduce
returns. Investors cannot invest directly in indices. Where appropriate, relevant index trademarks or index information has been licensed or sub-licensed for use. Inclusion of index information is not
intended to imply that the relevant index or its affiliated entities sponsor, endorse, sell, or promote the referenced securities, or that they Period Gross Return Net Return Differential

Pricing and Valuations. Prices do not necessarily reflect realizable values and are based on information considered to be reliable but are not guaranteed for accuracy, currency, or as realizable
values. Certain positions may be provided by third parties or may appear without a price if GS is unable to obtain a price and/or the security is not actively traded for a certain amount of time. Pricing
sources and methods are available upon request and are subject to change. The stated price/value is as of the date indicated. It is not an offer to buy or sell and is not represent at that any
transaction can be effected at this price. In the event of any discrepancy between the information contained herein and the information contained in your monthly account statements at Goldman
Sachs or another institution, the latter shall govern. Please immediately notify your Private Wealth Advisor of any discrepancies.
Fees and Charges. We have two pricing models for advisory relationships: a comprehensive fee model and a product based model. You should consider factors, including, but not limited to, your
financial needs and circumstances, investment objectives, services provided under the model, your preferences, and the size of your account. Certain account fees and expenses may be more or
less expensive depending on the model chosen. Actual fees may differ from estimated fees due to differences in strategies and amounts invested in particular strategies or overall. Charges applied to
your accounts and transactions may include execution charges (including commissions, commission equivalents, mark-ups, mark-downs and dealer spreads), investment advisory fees, and custody
fees. When we act as broker, we are generally compensated by an execution charge on a trade by trade basis. When we act as advisor, we generally earn a fee based on assets under management
and may also be earning execution charges. More information about fees and charges is included in our account agreements, fee schedules and trade confirmations. If estimated fees are shown
herein, we have included a description of our fee calculation methodology.

Danin says that there is a sizable and

when I asked him if the West Bank
economy could support Rawabi. This is a
Palestinian national project, he said. It is
the best of what is possible in that it's
private sector-led, and it's profit-making

And it has supporters in high places. When
President Barack Obama met with Israeli
officials in Washington in September of
2010, Rawabi was on the agenda.

From one perspective, Rawabi is a historic
investment in Palestine, as well as an
unusually open point of cooperation

could improve the lives of Palestinians,
while convincing Israelis that they have
nothing to fear from their neighbors'
prosperity. But any attempts to change

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011573.txt,"In retrospect, given all the interruptions, I’m a little surprised that I managed
to get through my university studies. My classmates helped. They were
incredibly generous in going through with me what I’d missed, and sharing their
notes, whenever I returned for an extended stint of reserve duty. P’ve seen
interviews with university friends saying I was one of the top students in our
class. But that is more generous than true. It would be fairer to say I was a good
student. Working hard in the final year, I did finish in the upper quarter of the
class, and several of my math and science professors strongly urged me to go on
to graduate school.

But my mind was made up on returning to the army. And as I balanced my
studies with plans for the future during my final months, | still hadn’t given up
hope that Nili would be there with me. When she returned from Paris, we had
started seeing each other again. Whenever I could, I would take the bus down to
Tel Aviv and spend the weekend with her. Everything I’d loved about her since
that first meeting in the Airya, everything I valued in our relationship, was still
there. Yet so, too, were the doubts: whether she was ready to commit herself to
sharing our lives together; and whether a kibbutznik like me could ever truly fit
in to her 7el Avivi world. Shortly before Karameh, she’d invited me to a Friday-
night party with a group of her friends. It was the first time she was including
me, as part of a couple, in her social circle. But almost from the moment we got
there, I felt out of place. For her, it was just another party, one of dozens she
must have been to since she was a teenager. But I immediately felt out of place.
I didn’t drink. I couldn’t dance. I couldn’t help feeling like a wallflower, or an
alien presence.

Now, I decided there was no point in waiting and wondering. I borrowed a
Jeep from an army friend, with the idea that Nili and I could spend three or four
days together, driving south from Jerusalem into the Negev and the Judean
desert: to be alone, to talk, to see whether we actually had a future. I wrote her a
note, took the bus to Tel Aviv while she was at work, and dropped it through the
letterbox. “J am going on this trip, into the desert,” it said. “Id love it if you
could come with me. I think it’s important for us.”

I never heard back. I felt crushed, though I tried hard to tell myself it was
better to know where we stood. Years later, she told me the envelope had ended

I Never Feel Like Less of an American ... 
I never feel like less of an American than when idealistic teenagers call for gun control, and I know Congress 
won't let it happen. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026788 
I never feel like less of an American than when the richest people abandon the poorest. 
I never feel like less of an American than when a President lies, and his supporters applaud. 
Sometimes it takes the experience of shame to galvanize change, and this is such a time. Having lived too long 
on the self-image of America is the greatest, richest, most powerful country in the world, we produced 
Trumpism, which has shattered that image. It's been a traumatic experience. Mature adults are supposed to be 
resilient in the face of difficult challenges, but a person can bend only so far. That's why one sees an outraged 
Resistance, moving from He's not my President to Is this even my country? 
If as we often hear, America isn't a place on the map but an idea, the idea is in trouble. Every day I'm reminded 
of Sinclair Lewis's 1935 novel, It Can Happen Here, which imagined the election of a Fascist to the 
presidency. As tumultuous as the Thirties were, fascism didn't happen here. In fact, the New Deal and the 
inception of a social safety net came about. But reactionary forces simmer away when they aren't at a boil. Who 
would have thought that the leader of the House in 2018 wants to weaken the social safety net by saving 
Social Security and Medicare? 
A survey of 117 historians recently ranked Donald Trump the worst President in history, which seems right 
after only one year in office. But what makes me feel like less of an American is knowing that 40% of my 
fellow citizens love and approve of him, who have reservations, yes, but overall want his agenda to move ahead. 
In the daily fire hose of presidential offenses, little attention was paid to the revelation by Reince Priebus, 
former White House chief of staff, that however chaotic this Presidency looked from the outside, it was worse 
on the inside--fifty times worse. 
Trumpism is the product of collective consciousness, and although one hears about the wisdom of crowds, but 
when collective consciousness veers as close to lunacy as this administration, healing is the only answer. 
Reactionary forces, racists, white supremacists, and haters are like algae on the surface of a pond. Algae only 
appears if the pond is dank and still. When water is clear and flowing, there is no condition for algae to thrive 
in. 
The remedies for healing America are flowing with more force than before. Notions like Medicare for all, free 
higher education, and bringing huge banks to heel were semi-fantasy in the last Presidential election. Now they 
are quickly moving mainstream. Ecological awareness is growing and unstoppable. There is a possibility that by 
destroying America's self-image, Trumpism has opened the way for facing reality, which after all is better than 
living up to a self-image that is hollow at the core. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026789 
In the meantime, each person needs to remain resilient and relevant. The structure of government moves slowly, 
and it took decades of incremental moves for the reactionary right to gain the power it presently holds tight. If 
the midterm elections don't restore sanity, then collective consciousness is more wounded than we imagine. 
Without a doubt Trumpism is horrifying, but the grievances it represents are real. Address those grievances 
honestly and with a clear conscience: that's the only remedy.

4 easy ways to squeeze meditation into a busy day 
By Deepak Chopra and Kabir Sehgal, Contributors 
There is no doubt that you can benefit from daily meditation. It has several health benefits like reducing cortisol 
levels that cause stress, lessening blood pressure, and slowing the heart rate. Besides these physiological effects, 
it can also have a positive impact on your work life, by increasing your attention span, deepening your focusing, 
catalyzing your creativity, and making you a better listener. 
Given all these constructive outcomes, meditation should become an integral and required part of your day. But 
finding the time to actually engage in this practice can be difficult, so here are a few ways you can incorporate 
mindfulness exercises into your day. 
First, a morning ritual 
When you wake up, you're already in a quiet room in which you feel relaxed. This might be the last time you're 
surrounded by silence, so take five minutes and practice breathing in and out. Notice the sound of your breath as 
you inhale and exhale. Imagine the air rushing into your mouth and filling your lungs, and then picture it 
leaving your body and filling the room. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026790 
Instead of hitting the snooze button, sit up right and fill your morning with peace. These few minutes of 
mindfulness will prepare you for your busy day to come. Pretty soon, you'll get so used to meditation in the 
morning, that you won't want to start your day without it. 
Second, a morning commute 
If you take public transportation like a bus or the subway, you can use these moments for practicing meditation. 
To be sure, you might be disturbed by the noise of other people taking and public-address announcements. 
But by simply closing your eyes and taking long breaths, you will inevitably retreat into a cocoon where you 
pay less attention to the sounds around you and train your mind on taking deep breaths. When you finally open 
your eyes, you will feel a sense of accomplishment, that you have gone somewhere on your commute that few 
others have — to a place of higher consciousness. 
Third, a lunch retreat 
When your colleagues and clients go to lunch, you can take advantage of this quieter period of the day. If you 
have your own office, you can close the door and spend five minutes again practicing breathing in and out. If 
you work in an open-office where you have limited privacy, you could either steal away into a conference room 
or bathroom to find a few moments of peace. 
Some forward-thinking firms like General Motors, Google and Intel encourage employees to practice 
meditation, and some even have rooms and facilities on their campuses dedicated for this purpose. If you work 
at one of these companies, make sure to take advantage of these benefits. 
Fourth, a night time ritual 
Before your turn down your bed and go to sleep, try spending a few minutes sitting upright on your bed and 
practicing your breathing. You will find that when you are engaged in deep breathing exercises, it will help still 
your thoughts and prepare you for a better night sleep. A night time practice of meditation might make you feel 
better rested in the morning too.

Making having children expensive in terms of upbringing and missed opportunity (like in the west) is a more
humane way. Environmental stress while leaving near rock bottom tends to lead people to have more
children, because there is no missed opportunity, and high mortality requires more attempts at procreation.
Humans are a hardy species, outside of focused famine events and wars only small fractions of any given
population die.

I suspect that strong reductions in population will come from large-scale failure of agriculture. The climate

might be wrong.

The radical idea of treating individuals in a society as cells and the society itself as a well-organized organism
is fascism, or course. Probably the most efficient and rationally stringent way of governance, if someone
could pull it off in a sustainable way; and if it is aggressive and expansive, its efficiency makes it a virus that
everybody will want to stomp out. Fascism makes romantic doo-gooders like me very uncomfortable (I
visited KZ Buchenwald five times and it had a profound influence on me; we East Germans inoculated
ourselves very thoroughly against fascism), and the general public will not be willing to consider it.

I rather like the treatment Fascism gets in the Amazon Series The Man in the High Castle, which explores
what would have happened if the Germans and Japanese had won the war: A society that tries to function as a
brutal and ruthlessly efficient machine, eliminating all social and evolutionary slack. It is very dark, but not a
flat caricature of pointless evil for its own sake. Heinlein's late book Starship Troopers explores fascism,
too, but unlike Philipp K Dick he does not see it as a form of insanity, but as the most desirable order.

I find your political incorrectness very fascinating. In the beginning, I thought it is a form of costly
signaling, but now I think you are simply entirely unconstrained in your thoughts. How did you manage in
your youth? Did you get in trouble, or did you keep your thoughts to yourself? I wonder what kind of person
you want to transform into.

It was interesting to notice that at the Forbidden Research conference, nobody managed to say anything
remotely out-of line. One large discussion group wanted to address the question of whether democracy still
works, and mostly expressed their disagreement with Trump. Ideology is like halitosis: easy to see in others,
hard in oneself. A speaker felt that the media stifle all criticism of Trump, another wanted to remove men
and Elon Musk from government, and everybody strongly agreed that we need more diversity everywhere.

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024387.txt,"The Civilization Jihad includes situating such Jihadists in critical positions in the society, in the government, in
the legal system, the military, and elsewhere. It includes the control over university programs that distribute
propaganda about Islam and Islamic history which then filters down throughout textbooks for even younger
students. It includes control over most of the nation’s mosques and local Imams guiding the mess ages engaged
Muslims are receiving. Most troublesome are the Muslim g roups (CAIR, ISNA, MSA and others associated
and/or joint venture partners with the Muslim Brotherhood) supposedly interested in “outreach” which know
how to appear Westernized and interested in the goals of Western Civilization. They have fooled a large part of
our authorities and media due in part to their patience and willingness to chip away, one airport prayer room,
one frivolous intimidating lawsuit, one Congressman or CIA officer, one mosque, one ruling at a time.

Particularly in the US, given our deep attachment to freedom as well as cultural and psychological tendencies
toward diversity, Western guilt and expectations of truthfulness, this effort is devious and difficult to uproot.
The Civilization Jihadists present one face to the American public which is completely at odds with their true
agenda and how they deal in private. Jamie, you and David and others such as Steve Emerson, Frank Gaffney,
Andy McCarthy and others have done s o much to uncover this level of Jihad that your readers should be urged
to review as much of their work (including Steve’s recent excellent documentary, The Grand Deception, and
Frank’s important web video course, The Muslim Brotherhood in America) as possible.

Finally, there is a third level — the International Institutional Jihad. Here the most powerful international
institutions such as the UN and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and others seek to push into America
from without those changes which are difficult to complete from within. The OIC is the largest Islamic
institution in the world. It essentially controls the vote in the UN’s General Assembly and thus explains in part
the absurd and abject pro-Islamic, anti-Israel thrust of that organizat ion. This level seeks to use the power of
Islamic nations to work fro m outside the West to force changes within the West. While there are various
conflicts between many of the nations, being Islamic majority states, there is a great deal they agree upon which
becomes the focus of these efforts. Just as the Obama administration is beginning to cooperate with
international efforts to control gun ownership, so has Hillary Clinton’s Istanbul Process become a dangerous
step in the effort to restrict speech critical of Islam by norm (or possibly even treaty) when it may not be fully
executable by domestic action alone.

I should point out that Stephen Coughlin, the former Pentagon officer who has an important must-see
presentation of Islamic Law, uses different names for these same three levels — Jihad, Dawa, and Ummah. Had I
seen his work before I wrote my book I would have conformed to his categorizations.

We must learn how powerful language has become on all three levels. Words such as “peace, $B!I
“freedom,” ”terrorism,” and phrases such as “human rights” have different meanings for us and for our Islamic
Enemy. To oversimplify, “peace” is not something for now but that which comes when all the earth is
submitting to Islam. In the context of battles, “peace” is at best a temporary ceasefire. “Freedom” is best
understood as having the freedom to fully submit to Islam, not to choose whatever beliefs one desires while
respecting the same right in others. We’ve all seen how “human rights” and “terror” really only apply among
Muslims, not to non-Muslims. Our enemy fully understands these differences and uses them at all levels to
paralyze us.

Look simply at how the phrase “TIsraeli-Palestinian conflict” has equalized the two parties, making it all the
easier to ascribe features of one to the other and view the problem as a simple-to fix division of ass ets into
statehoods but for personality problems among the leaders. The simple truth is that this is and has always been a
one-sided Arab war against Israel as Ruth Wisse and others have described and, as Bibi Netanyahu made clear,
the ONLY state truly at issue here has been the State of Israel that the Arabs have refused for over half a
century. Nonetheless, the Control Factor hypnotically abuses the mind’s susceptibility to the intricacies of
language.

Even the label “Peace Process” has been damaging language. While most focus upon the first word, turning this
into a “process” has helped ensure that peace is never obtained. It is more appropriately called the “Extortion
Process” because all that results is that violence is used over decades to extract concessions from Israel.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016833.txt,"agent that perceives, and acts in order to maximize, its expected utility. Subfields such as
logical planning, robotics, and natural-language understanding are special cases of the
general paradigm. AI has incorporated probability theory to handle uncertainty, utility
theory to define objectives, and statistical learning to allow machines to adapt to new
circumstances. These developments have created strong connections to other disciplines
that build on similar concepts, including control theory, economics, operations research,
and statistics.

In both the logical-planning and rational-agent views of AI, the machine’s
objective—whether in the form of a goal, a utility function, or a reward function (as in
reinforcement learning)—1s specified exogenously. In Wiener’s words, this is “the
purpose put into the machine.” Indeed, it has been one of the tenets of the field that AI
systems should be general-purpose—i.e., capable of accepting a purpose as input and
then achieving it—rather than special-purpose, with their goal implicit in their design.
For example, a self-driving car should accept a destination as input instead of having one
fixed destination. However, some aspects of the car’s “driving purpose” are fixed, such
as that it shouldn’t hit pedestrians. This is built directly into the car’s steering algorithms
rather than being explicit: No self-driving car in existence today “knows” that pedestrians
prefer not to be run over.

Putting a purpose into a machine which optimizes its behavior according to clearly
defined algorithms seems an admirable approach to ensuring that the machine’s “conduct
will be carried out on principles acceptable to us!” But, as Wiener warns, we need to put
in the right purpose. We might call this the King Midas problem: Midas got exactly what
he asked for—namely, that everything he touched would turn to gold—but too late he
discovered the drawbacks of drinking liquid gold and eating solid gold. The technical
term for putting in the right purpose is value alignment. When it fails, we may
inadvertently imbue machines with objectives counter to our own. Tasked with finding a
cure for cancer as fast as possible, an AI system might elect to use the entire human
population as guinea pigs for its experiments. Asked to de-acidify the oceans, it might
use up all the oxygen in the atmosphere as a side effect. This is a common characteristic
of systems that optimize: Variables not included in the objective may be set to extreme
values to help optimize that objective.

Unfortunately, neither AI nor other disciplines (economics, statistics, control
theory, operations research) built around the optimization of objectives have much to say
about how to identify the purposes “we really desire.” Instead, they assume that
objectives are simply implanted into the machine. AI research, in its present form,
studies the ability to achieve objectives, not the design of those objectives.

Steve Omohundro has pointed to a further difficulty, observing that intelligent
entities must act to preserve their own existence. This tendency has nothing to do with a
self-preservation instinct or any other biological notion; it’s just that an entity cannot
achieve its objectives if it’s dead. According to Omohundro’s argument, a
superintelligent machine that has an off-switch—which some, including Alan Turing
himself, in a 1951 talk on BBC Radio 3, have seen as our potential salvation—will take
steps to disable the switch in some way.! Thus we may face the prospect of
superintelligent machines—their actions by definition unpredictable by us and their

My most ungrateful homicide client: Angela Davis

Clients whose cases I have helped to win generally respond in one of two ways: some express
great, sometimes excessive, gratitude. They offer to do anything in exchange for you having
saved their lives. Others behave as if the case had never happened and you don’t exist. I have
seen former clients purposely cross the street to avoid even “seeing” me. They don’t want to be
reminded of the dark period in their lives during which they required a criminal lawyer. In only
one case did a former client show absolute ungratefulness for my role in helping her avoid a
murder conviction.

During the year that I was a visiting scholar at the Center For Advanced Studies and Behavioral
Science at Stanford, I was asked to consult on several aspects of the Angela Davis murder case.
Davis, who was one of the leaders of the American Communist Party, was accused of murder in
connection with a shootout that had occurred at the Marran County Courthouse as part of an
attempted escape of radical prisoners. Davis was accused of purchasing and providing the
shotgun that was used in the crime. She was also suspected of having engineered the attempt to
take hostages is order to barter them for the release of a prisoner she loved.

I worked on jury selection as well as on some constitutional issues. Davis was claiming that she
could not get a fair trial in any American court because she was black, female and a Communist.
Part of the reason I took the case was to help assure that she did get a fair trial. After several
grueling months, she was acquitted and set free. I don’t know whether she now believes she
received a fair trial. I do know that shortly thereafter I read that she was hired to become a
professor at the University of California in Santa Cruz.

Shortly thereafter, I read that she was going to Moscow to receive the Lenin human rights prize
from the Soviet Union. She said that she was pleased to receive the prize and that she would
spend the rest of her life helping to free political prisoners around the world. I called her office
and gave them a list of prisoners of conscience in the Soviet Union—mostly Jews who had been
imprisoned because they wanted to emigrate to Israel or to learn about their heritage. (Sharansky
was not yet among these prisoners, but he would soon join them.) I asked if she would be willing
to speak up on behalf of these political prisoners. Several days later, I received a call back from
Ms. Davis’s secretary informing me that Davis had looked into the people on my list and none of
them were political prisoners. “They are all Zionist fascists opponents of socialism.” Davis
refused to speak up on behalf of the Soviet dissidents.

Recently, I ran into an older and somewhat more reserved Angela Davis on the porch of the
Chilmark Store on Martha’s Vineyard. She was wearing a bicycle outfit and was cycling around
the island with some mutual friends, including her trial lawyer in the murder case. It was a

strange scene in this bastion of bourgeois affluence to see these former radicals enjoying the
comforts of capitalism in so relaxed a way. I reminded Davis of my participation in her case and
she expressed appreciation. I also reminded her of her refusal to speak up on behalf of Soviet
dissidents. In her mellow response, she said, “well so many other people were speaking up for
them, that I didn’t think it was necessary for me to add my voice.” It’s interesting how time
changes people’s memories. I did not press her as to whether she would today speak up on behalf

All this was part of the background to one of the most preposterous meetings in
modern politics. On June 9, 2016, Don Jr., Jared, and Paul Manafort met with a
movieworthy cast of dubious characters in Trump Tower after having been promised
damaging information about Hillary Clinton. Don Jr., encouraged by Jared and Ivanka,
was trying to impress his father that he had the stuff to rise in the campaign.

When this meeting became public thirteen months later, it would, for the Trump White
House, encapsulate both the case against collusion with the Russians and the case for it. It
was a case, or the lack of one, not of masterminds and subterfuge, but of senseless and
benighted people so guileless and unconcerned that they enthusiastically colluded in plain
sight.

OOK Ok

Walking into Trump Tower that June day were a well-connected lawyer from Moscow,
who was a likely Russian agent; associates of the Azerbaijani Russian oligarch Aras
Agalarov; a U.S. music promoter who managed Agalarov’s son, a Russian pop star; and a
Russian government lobbyist in Washington. Their purpose in visiting the campaign
headquarters of a presumptive major party nominee for president of the United States was
to meet with three of the most highly placed people on the campaign. This meeting was
preceded by an email chain addressed to multiple recipients inside the Trump campaign of
almost joyful intent: the Russians were offering a dump of negative or even incriminating
information about their opponent.

Among the why-and-how theories of this imbecilic meeting:

¢ The Russians, in organized or freelance fashion, were trying to entrap the Trump
campaign into a compromising relationship.

¢ The meeting was part of an already active cooperation on the part of the Trump
campaign with the Russians to obtain and distribute damaging information about
Hillary Clinton—and, indeed, within days of the Don Jr. meeting, WikiLeaks
announced that it had obtained Clinton emails. Less than a month later, it started to
release them.

¢ The wide-eyed Trump campaign, largely still playacting at running for president—
and with no thought whatsoever of actually winning the election—was open to any
and all entreaties and offers, because it had nothing to lose. Dopey Don Jr. (Fredo, as
Steve Bannon would dub him, in one of his frequent Godfather borrowings) was
simply trying to prove he was a player and a go-to guy.

¢ The meeting included the campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and the campaign’s
most influential voice, Jared Kushner, because: (a) a high-level conspiracy was
being coordinated; (b) Manafort and Kushner, not taking the campaign very

week x 50 = 2,000] = $20/hour). Estimate your hourly income by cutting the last three zeroes off of your
annual income and halving the remaining number (e.g., $50,000/year p $25/hour.

2. Estimate the amount of time you will save by grouping similar tasks together and batching them, and
calculate how much you have earned by multiplying this hour number by your per-hour rate ($20 here):

1 x per week: 10 hours = $200
Ix pertwoweeks: 20 hours = $400

1 x per month: 40 hours = S800

3. Test each of the above batching frequencies and determine how much problems cost to fix in each
period. If the cost is less than the above dollar amounts, batch even further apart.

For example, using our above math, if I check e-mail once per week and that results in an average loss
of two sales per week, totaling $80 in lost profit, I will continue checking once per week because $200
(10 hours of time) minus $80 is still a $120 net gain, not to mention the enormous benefits of completing
other main tasks in those 10 hours. If you calculate the financial and emotional benefit of completing just
one main task (such as landing a major client or completing a life-changing trip), the value of batching is
much more than the per-hour savings.

If the problems cost more than hours saved, scale back to the next-less-frequent batch schedule. In this
case, I would drop from once per week to twice per week (not daily) and attempt to fix the system so that
I can return to once per week. Do not work harder when the solution is working smarter. I have batched
both personal and business tasks further and further apart as [ve realized just how few real problems
come up. Some of my scheduled batches in 2007 were e-mail (Mondays 10:00 A.M.), phone (completely
eliminated), laundry (every other Sunday at 10:00 P.M), credit cards and bills (most are on automatic
payment, but I check balances every second Monday after e-mail), strength training (every 4th day for
30 minutes), etc.

Empowerment Failure: Rules and Readjustment

The vision is really about empowering workers, giving them all the information about what’s
going on so they can do a lot more than they’ve done in the past.

—BILL GATES, cofounder of Microsoft, richest man in the world

Eb inpowermen failure refers to being unable to accomplish a task without first obtaining permission or
information. It is often a case of being micromanaged or micromanaging someone else, both of which
consume your time.

For the employee, the goal is to have full access to necessary information and as much independent
decision-making ability as possible. For the entrepreneur, the goal is to grant as much information and
independent decision-making ability to employees or contractors as possible.

Customer service is often the epitome of empowerment failure, and a personal example from
BrainQUICKEN illustrates just how serious but easily solved the problem can be.

unreasonable guess, since both of us were grinning throughout. Others concluded
that because each of us was trying to nudge the other to go in first, it was a sign of
underlying conflict: neither of us wanted to allow the other the privilege of
appearing to be polite. Still others, bizarrely, said that it was an ornate Middle
Eastern power play, with the aim of demonstrating that / was ultimately in control
of proceedings. In fact, it would turn out to be a singularly apt image of what
happened in the days that followed: a reluctant Arafat, an engaged and expectant
Prime Minister of Israel, a smiling and hopeful Clinton.

We did begin on a note of optimism. In my opening statement, I said: ““Now is
the time for us to make a peace of the brave, to find a way to live together side by
side with mutual respect, and to create a better future for our children.” Arafat said
he hoped that the peace Begin and Sadat had made at Camp David would prove an
auspicious example. “With the help of President Clinton, we could reach a deal
that is good for both sides.”

But it was going to take more than noble words. The details of a peace treaty, or
even a framework agreement, were going to require negotiation. Both Arafat and I
arrived fully aware of the shape of the “hard decisions” I’d referred to months
earlier when we met in Oslo. On his side, it would come down to whether he was
prepared for a comprehensive, final peace. A true “end of conflict,” with no get-out
clauses, no strings left untied, no further claims on either side. In concrete terms,
this would mean abandoning his claim for a notional hundreds of thousands of
Palestinian refugees to resettle inside the pre-1967 borders of the State of Israel.
And what were Israel’s difficult decisions? In return for the end of conflict, I
would have to deal away the maximum possible part of the West Bank, certainly
well above the 80 percent I’d quoted Shimon Peres as suggesting when I’d first
met with President Clinton. I would have to accept the idea of land swaps, if
necessary, in order to bring the overall percentage as near as possible to the
equivalent of the whole of the West Bank. I would have to be flexible on the
arrangements to ensure Israeli security oversight over the Jordan Valley. And if a
true peace was really on the table, both Arafat and I would have to consider some
form of compromise on the most emotionally and symbolically difficult issue of
all: the future governance of Jerusalem.

On the first evening, we met as an Israeli delegation to discuss our position for
the days ahead. Gili Sher and Danny Yatom helped me keep a clear overall picture

We know from our childhood that infinity plus one is still infinity.
Is there anything we can do to make infinity bigger? Perhaps multiplying
infinity by infinity will do the trick.

Infinity times infinity can be visualized as a square with edges of
infinite length. We can show that this square is the same size as a one-
dimensional infinity through a clever trick — the zigzag method. Mark
the infinity square into a grid. Start in the corner square, go across,
diagonally down, then across, diagonally up, and so on. I'll draw you
a picture. We visit every square in our grid using a single line. We can
then lay down our infinite zigzag line next to the infinite line of one
of the edges. The lines are the same length as they are both infinitely
long! So infinity, times infinity, can be matched to infinity, they are the
same. Cantor thought this a very strange result and wrote to a fellow
mathematician, Dedekind, “Je le vois, mais je ne le crois pas!”, “I see it,
but I don't believe it!”

If you are struggling with this, don’t worry. We just jumped forward
to quite a complex concept. Let’s take it more slowly. One way to get a
better grip on infinity is through the stories of David Hilbert and the
Infinity Hotel.

Infinity for Dummies

Hilbert’s Hotel is a mythical building with an infinite number of rooms.
Other than this strange feature it is a regular hotel complete with
minibar, dodgy TV, and slightly mad manager. The rooms are numbered
sequential starting at one, then two, three, four, and so on. The hotel
allows you to play a series of mathematical games to see how infinity
behaves.

Are there the same number of minibars as there are rooms? That's
easy. I said every room has a minibar. We can use the matching technique
to match minibars with rooms. Go to the first room. There is a number
on the door and a minibar inside. The same goes for room 2 and 3 and
this goes on forever. I’ve just proven two infinite things are the same -
rooms and bars, but I still have not shown you why the zigzag line is the
same length as the edge line.

When you first explain infinity to a child they immediately ask
“What's infinity plus one.” A particularly smart kid I met, Dermot, asked,
“What's infinity plus three?” Hilbert’s Hotel allows us to answer this
problem in a way we can visualize.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013692.txt,"As noted above, the cross-disciplinary cohesiveness of such a vaguely
defined field occurred as the result of the unanticipated discovery of a relatively
small set of nonlinear phenomena, universalities, that implicated many fields of
mathematics, from differential geometry to number theory, and were found in a
broad range of physical and biological realizations, from turbulent plasmas and
chemical and enzymatic reactions to neuroendocrine hormone release patterns. It is
perhaps counter-intuitive but, whereas linear systems can generate an infinite
number of solutions locating points anywhere the person writing the equations
wants them to go, nonlinear systems are generally restricted to a finite set of global
dynamics and these emerge on their own from the intrinsic dynamics of the system.
Trying to make these systems follow orders, not unlike finding the most clinically
effective dosage range of a psychopharmacological agent, require the empiricism of

trial and error experiments.

A second class of computational accidents involving nonlinear systems
resulted in unanticipated coherence rather than unpredictable disorder. Using one
of the early “high speed” digital computers at Los Alamos, MANIC I, Enrico Fermi
with Pasta and Ulam (1955) attempted to obtain a many-body statistical
thermodynamic equilibrium analogous to heat generated noise by coupling 64
particles together with nonlinear springs. They found only a few low period modes
that oscillated indefinitely. Instead of equidistribution of the energy into 128 degrees
of freedom (64 locations x 64 velocities in 128 dimensional phase space), they
found it gathered up into only few coherent modes. Although the relevance to
biological science of nonlinear multifrequency coherence is a bit off from our focus,
it is worthwhile noting that a recent (Karhunen-Loeve) decomposition of the alpha
band of the resting alert human EEG revealed only three dominant temporal-spatial
modes: anterior-posterior, rotational and standing (Friedrich et al, 1991) and “few

frequency coherence’ is a frontier of inquiry in brain wave research.

A heterogeneous collection of coupled nonlinear elements in the form of
widely distributed, multi-location, multifrequency systems such as cross-cortical,

In recent months, China's BAT collapse has demonstrated how costly the expectation of 
invincibility can be—Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent are all down more than 24% 
from their year-to-date closing highs. Citigroup's head of Asia strategy, Mohammed 
Apabhai, told CNN an apt analogy about the investor sentiment that led to BAT's collapse, 
likening the exuberance for tech stocks to the Looney Tunes cartoons in which Wile E. 
Coyote chases Road Runner over a cliff. Given they've more or less moved in 
tandem for years, will FAANG follow the same path as BAT? 
' EtSFILir., 
Source: Stockcharts.com 
The BAT collapse was triggered by subpar earnings and a shifting regulatory environment 
in China. Facebook's miss in 2Q18—which drove a $120 billion single-day market cap 
loss, the biggest ever for a U.S. company—showed how decisive a turn could be if more 
U.S. tech darlings stumble this quarter. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033115 
There are mounting fundamental reasons to question the 3Q18 earnings 
prospects of FAANG, from the accelerating user backlash against Facebook to Apple's 
trade war exposure to Amazon's rapidly-intensifying workforce revolt that could see the e-
commerce giant left with no option but to raise wages and improve workplace conditions 
for its warehouse and Whole Foods employees. 
However, as Apabhai suggests, the message BAT is sending is less about earnings, and 
more about the cost of exuberance. And FAANG exuberance faces threats that go beyond 
fundamentals. A flurry of regulatory announcements last week signaled the 
political tide has turned in the U.S. Across every branch of government, the 
message was consistent: the U.S. no longer trusts tech giants to self-
police. And the public agrees—according to a Gallup poll last month, 79% of 
Americans now believe tech companies should be regulated the same way 
the news media is. 
Regardless of political will, threats may not turn to action in the near term. Nonetheless, 
FAANG appears increasingly vulnerable to a decisive sentiment shift. At some point, the 
relentless barrage of bad news will force investors to begin pricing in regulatory 
risks. Any sustained stumble by FAANG's leadership could cripple exuberance, and cause 
an unraveling of passive and algorithmic strategies that are heavily overweight tech 
(see W/LTWApril 7, 2018 for more). We will continue to watch closely to 
estimate timing, but given SAT's collapse, today more than ever, acute 
scrutiny of tech giant leadership is required. 
Through August 28, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft had accounted for greater than 35% of 
the S&P 500's total return this year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices data. It took 
Amazon just 165 trading days to grow its market value from $600 billion in January to $1 
trillion. The combined market cap of FAAMG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and 
Google) now sits over $4 trillion, or roughly equal to the combined market cap of the 283 
smallest S&P 500 members. 
Tech's continued market leadership means investors have largely discounted 
the mounting risks tech giants face. We have been warning about the downsides of 
tech giant monopolism for more than two years in these pages, from surveillance/data 
security concerns to anticompetitive behavior and their role in escalating inequality. For 
the political establishment, for the media, for the public, this year has seen a 
broad awakening—the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the backlash against Jeff Bezos' 
astonishing wealth, and tech's ever-skyrocketing market caps were all warning 
signs. The past month signals a new phase has begun: from a distant 
rumbling of change to preparation for action. 
The number of significant tech-related regulatory developments that have emerged from 
the U.S. and the E.U. in recent weeks is nothing short of staggering. Here is an 
abbreviated list: 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033116 
• President Trump attacked Google for liberal bias, and claimed Google, Facebook, 
and Amazon represent a very antitrust situation. 
• Attorney General Jeff Sessions convened a meeting of Republican state 
attorneys general to discuss whether tech giants may be hurting competition and 
intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms. 
• Facebook, Twitter, and Google were called to testify in front of the House and Senate 
about election interference, political bias, etc. Google declined to attend. 
• The FTC has begun a series of hearings on Digital Age antitrust, the first such 
hearings since the 1990s. 
• The FTC revealed the hiring of Lina Kahn—heralded for authoring a groundbreaking 
antitrust argument against Amazon—as an advisor. (See section 5 for more.) 
• Republican Senator Orrin Hatch asked the FTC to reopen a 2013 
antitrust case against Google. 
• Democratic Senator Mark Warner released a six-point policy proposal on regulating 
the tech industry. 
• Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders proposed the BEZOS Act, which would tax

professor Scott Galloway, who told CNBC last week after the congressional hearings: 
I don't see anything meaningful coming out of this panel, much less Washington...D.C. 
lacks the domain expertise or the will to go after big tech. Where you may 
see it is, one, out of Brussels and, two, out of [the FTC, the DOJ, or] a red 
state whose attorney general sees the brightest path between the AG's mansion and the 
governor's mansion is a populist argument against big tech. 
Evidence of fundamental weakness could exacerbate the investor reaction to escalating 
regulatory news. By all accounts, Facebook has continued to bleed 
users. According to Pew Research poll results released earlier this month, more than a 
quarter of U.S. Facebook users claim to have deleted the app from their phones over the

Importance: High 
Dear Jeffrey, 
As you probably know, Woody Allen's legal team said that we couldn't use the film we shot of him: online, for 
broadcast, anywhere. 
It was a fantastic experience taping with him and so, even if I can't ever use the footage, I'm still grateful to you 
for making the day possible. But of course I'd like to use the footage. I decided when--way back-- we got this 
very negative answer back from his lawyers that I should just take my time about asking --since it would take 
us 2 years to be ready to edit the footage anyway (The online course is chronological. When I taped Woody we 
were still back in 1730. Now we've gotten to the 1920s) 
Well, we've now arrived at the season when we'll be editing materials on William Carlos Williams for our 
course on Modernism and, as we discussed on Saturday, on poetry and other arts, The Poetry of Art, Sport, 
and Play 
I would also, of course, love to make a tv episode out of the conversation, but the threshold question is whether 
he'll let us use it for anything at all. In case it would matter, 
Other performers who have already taped with me include 
John Lithgow, 
Diane Paulus 
Julie Taymor 
Nas 
Eve Ensler 
Damian Woetzel 
Kate Burton

Alfre Woodard

Tony Kushner

and those who have agreed to tape with me include

Those in other fields include journalists, senators, president clinton etc etc. You've read my pitch before (many

Technology and Research

Technology transfers between nations exist on a spectrum of legitimacy. In many
developing economies, multinational corporations willingly agree to skills and technology
transfer arrangements in exchange for the right to operate. Governments support these
measures in the hopes of furthering economic development. Transfers cross the threshold
into illegitimacy when coercion, misappropriation, theft, or espionage are deployed with
the effect of undermining a company’s, and ultimately its home country’s, economic
competitiveness. China’s expropriation of American technology is an example of how
it leverages its influence among universities, corporations, and diaspora communities to
further strategic objectives. This section reviews the targets of China’s expropriation efforts,
the state and nontraditional collectors involved, and concludes with recommendations
for how the United States can better defend against this phenomenon. It is important to
note that not all expropriation of intellectual property occurs at the explicit direction
of the government and that China is not the sole country targeting the United States.
Nonetheless, China—whether at the level of the state or individual—is considered the
most serious offender.

While Chinese cyberthreats and clandestine spying against the United States dominate
the public discourse, a far more serious threat is posed by China’s informal or “extralegal”
transfers of US technology and IP theft.! Operating under the radar, these quiet diversions
of US technical know-how are carried out by groups and individuals in the United States,
whose support for China erodes America’s technological edge and ability to compete

in international markets. These groups are managed by a professional cadre of Chinese
government and government-associated science and technology transfer specialists who
facilitate intellectual property “exchanges” through a maze of venues. They target specific
advanced technologies drawn from China’s industrial planning priorities (e.g., Made in
China 20257) such as semiconductors, robotics, next-generation information technologies
(e.g., big data, smart grid, internet of things), aviation, artificial intelligence, and electric
vehicles. As a result of their efforts, a commission convened by the National Bureau

of Asian Research concluded that IP theft, primarily from China, costs the American
economy hundreds of billions of dollars each year, with significant impact on employment
and innovation.* Former commander of United States Cyber Command and Director of
the National Security Agency General Keith Alexander was even more grave when he
asserted the ongoing theft of IP by China represents “the greatest transfer of wealth in
human history.”*

U.S. and abroad will support continued expenditures on ECE. In 2001, 70% of children with college-
educated mothers attended childcare programs, while only 38% of children whose mothers had less
than a high school degree attended childcare programs. A recent report by the U.S. Department of
Commerce reveals that families with college degrees spent an average of $92.67 per week (per child)
on childcare in 2000, whereas parents without a high school degree only spent an average of $59.70
per week per child.

mM increasing demand for Employer-Sponsored Centers. With increased levels of employment,
corporations are witnessing growing demand for ECE services. Companies benefit from offering

childcare services to their employees as (i) it often reduces employee absenteeism; (ii) serves as a
perquisite, which differentiates the employer's compensation package; and (iii) tends to Jower turnover
rates. ECE services contribute to a stable and consistent workforce.

H Favorable tax incentives. Certain tax incentives are available to parents utilizing childcare programs.
Specifically, Section 21 of the Internal Revenue Code provides a federal income tax credit (Child and
Dependent Care Credit) ranging from 20% to 35% {increased in 2003) of certain childcare expenses
for “qualifying individuals.” The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 created a
Federal Employer Tax Credit for certain childcare expenses beginning in 2002. Employers can
receive a credit of 25% of their spending on the construction or rehabilitation of a child care facility or
on contracts with a third party child care facility to provide child care services to employees.
Corporations also benefit from tax incentives of up to $150,000 per year.

8.3.2 Industry Characteristics

The ECE sector has a number of favorable operating characteristics. First, well-run school operators
enjoy high returns on capital, predictable revenue streams and strong free cash flows, with students
generally paying in advance of services delivered. Second, industry data shows that tuition rates have
increased by approximately 7%, a rate which has exceeded inflation.” The current outlook suggests no
change in this dynamic. Third, government regulation and licensing standards represent notable barriers
to entry.

Given that education is a universally accepted product, management believes that our business model is
highly scalable. The basic center model is expected to be essentially repeatable and transferable to new
markets and locations. With labor representing approximately 50% of the ictal operating cost structure,
companies within this sector tend to benefit from a variable cost structure, which allows them to reduce
costs as economic and market conditions change.

Often the demanding requirements for the selection of school directors and teachers can limit the pool of
qualified employees for the industry. Low pay also tends to result in high turnover rates of approximately
50% annually within the industry.

8.3.3. Competitive Landscape: Early Childhood Education

The ECE sector is highly fragmented with the top six previders representing approximately 5% of all
organized ECE centers. The Company’s primary competitors are (i) local nursery schools and child care
centers, some of which are non-profit (including religious-affiliated centers), (ii) providers of services that
operate out of their homes and (ill) other for-profit companies which may operate a number of centers,
Local nursery schools and ECE centers generally charge less for their services. Many religious-affiliated
and other non-profit child care centers have no or lower rental costs than for-profit chains, may receive
donations or other funding to cover operating expenses and may utilize volunteers for staffing.
Consequently, tuition rates at these centers are commonly tower than the Company’s rates.

is the top official with oversight of China’s overseas propaganda (J\B) efforts, while
Politburo member and director of the CCP Propaganda Department Huang Kunming
oversees all media organs and has day-to-day oversight of the entire propaganda
system. Wang Yang, another PBSC member and the chairman of the Chinese
People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), has overall responsibility for

the United Front portfolio, although Sun Chunlan (the only female member of the
twenty-five-man Politburo and former director of the United Front Work Department
from 2014 to 2017) may also continue to have some residual responsibilities as well,
since her current portfolio includes education and culture. Additionally, You Quan, a
member of the Politburo Secretariat, is now the new head of the UFWD, and he is in
charge of the day-to-day work of the department. These leaders’ views on particular
issues carry a great deal of weight and can often result in significant policy

initiatives or modifications.

Besides issuing brief policy directives via their comments on documents (known

as #t7), top leaders can also communicate their ideas or orders in conversations or
meetings with the ministers in charge of functional bureaucracies. Such ideas or orders
can lead to actions at the implementation level or to the formulation of a new policy or

the modifications of an existing policy.

Policy Coordination

The Foreign Affairs Commission, which used to be called the Foreign Affairs
Leading Small Group (est. 1956), is by far the most important. The role of the
Commission is similar to that of the interagency “principals committees” in the
US system. Its chairman is Xi Jinping, while Premier Li Keqiang and Vice President
Wang Qishan serve as vice chairmen. Other PBSC members Wang Huning and
Han Zheng are members. Le Yucheng, a vice minister of Foreign Affairs, is deputy
director. Other members of the Commission include the most senior leaders

of the Chinese government: Yang Jiechi, and the ministers of Foreign Affairs,
State Security, Defense, Public Security, Commerce, the CCP’s International
Liaison Department, Taiwan Affairs Office, Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office,
Propaganda Department, External Propaganda Office, and Overseas Chinese Affairs
Office.

The Commission also has an attached “office,” known as the Central Foreign Affairs
Office (#2447), which has a dedicated staff of approximately fifty (many of whom are

seconded from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Liaison Department of the

that has made this case so difficult, because if we

It's a type of living closely associated with
the Palestinians’ neighbors in Israel. They
know very well that just a 20-minute drive
away, there's a community with a much
higher standard of living. And that
community happened to be one
representing the occupier, quote-unquote
the 'enemy.'’ But they would love to live
like that. And that's why when they come
to Rawabi some of them don't believe this
is for them initially. The first thing that
goes through their mind is that this could
be for the Israelis.

But it is for them. Rawabi's significance
could lie in something more mundane than
basic issues of sovereignty and control in
the West Bank. It lies in the common,
human desire -- powerful on either side of
the Green Line -- for a comfortable and
dignified existence.

In some quarters, this idea of working
within the present and less-than-ideal
political and economic framework to
achieve this goal is nothing short of
inflammatory. The U.S.-based, anti-peace
process website Electronic Intifada has
smeared Masri as an Israeli collaborator,
and there have been scattered accusations
that the project actually legitimizes Israeli
control over the West Bank.

The Washington Post

Avoiding a summer of blood

David Ignatius

June 22 -- “Peace is at hand,” Henry Kissinger famously announced
in October 1972 after a seeming breakthrough in Vietnam
negotiations. But it wasn’t at hand. It took three more months to
complete the Paris Peace Accords, which collapsed in 1975 when
North Vietnam overran Saigon.

This Vietnam history is a caution against premature optimism about
diplomatic solutions to deeply embedded conflicts, such as the one in
Afghanistan. But the fact remains, as is so often stated, that there is
no military solution to such conflicts. The challenge is creating a
dialogue among people who profoundly mistrust each other — and
averting a pell-mell civil war.

President Obama is embracing the logic of a political settlement for
Afghanistan with his speech Wednesday night. With Osama bin
Laden dead, Obama can claim that America’s core mission of
combating al-Qaeda is succeeding. He can bring some troops home
and step up diplomatic negotiations with the Taliban to reach a broad
peace deal by 2014.

Obama’s strategy for the Afghanistan negotiations highlights two
factors that could also be relevant in the increasingly messy conflicts
in Libya and Syria. First, the dialogue must be sponsored by people
inside the country that’s facing internal strife. The United States may
encourage contacts, but the process has to be “Afghan-led,” or
“Libyan-led,” or “Syrian-led.” Second, this dialogue requires a
regional framework, so that the combatants don’t turn to meddling
neighbors for help.

"
IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022383.txt,"Lame-duck session

With the Republican sweep in the election, the sense is
the lame-duck legislative agenda will be minimalist, with
Republicans having little motivation to engage in other
business aside from funding the government beyond
December 9. Congress returns the week of November 14
for organizational meetings and then departs again for
Thanksgiving week, leaving lawmakers only a couple of
weeks to finish their legislative business. Other
possibilities include: a defense authorization bill; the
conference report for an omnibus energy bill; the “21%
Century Cures” bill increasing funds for medical research
and accelerating drug approvals; the Water Resources
Development Act (WRDA), which would also carry money
to address the drinking-water crisisin Flint, Michigan; tax
extenders provisions; and retirement savings measures.

Government Funding. Under the stopgap continuing
resolution (CR) cleared on September 28, funding for the
government will expire on December 9. Only one of the
12 fiscal2017 appropriations bills has been sent to the
President so far. The government funding bill may take
the form of alarge omnibus bill or continuing resolution,
if the House and Senate Republican leadership’s
preference for moving spending bills on a standalone
basis or in packages does not pan out. Given the election
results, leaders are likely to limit the length of the
spending bill to a handful of monthsto allow the Trump
administration an opportunity to help shape fiscal 2017
spending next year. Speaker Ryan has said he favors a
strategy of combining spending bills into “minibus”
vehicles, but Senate Democrats have said such an
approach could be a tactic to get around the spending
caps Congress agreed to on a bipartisan basis last year.
The bill(s) may include additional spending to address
flooding in Louisiana and elsewhere, and damage from
Hurricane Matthew. If the vehicle for government funding
is alarge omnibus bill, Republicans may push for some
conservative policy “riders” as their price for accepting
the budget numbers that were negotiated last year.

Tax. There are no must-pass tax issues for the lame-duck
session, and it is unclear whether there will be
consideration of expiring tax provisions, House and
Senate miscellaneous tax bills, and tax technical
corrections. House Ways and Means Chairman Brady is
opposed to addressing tax extender provisions this year,
preferring to look forward to tax reform; that could also
be the position taken on other tax issues given that
Republicans will control Washington and have a shared
interest in tax reform. However, Senate Leader McConnell
previously committed to addressing energy tax extenders
this year, so they could still come up for consideration.

Pensions. The Senate could consider the Retirement
Enhancement and Savings Act, a package of measures
affecting multiple-employer pension plans, 401(k) plans
and annuities, which was approved on a unanimous vote
by the Senate Finance Committee on September 21. The
committee also approved the Miners Protection Act, which
would fund retiree health and pension benefitsfor coal
miners, which a majority of the committee’s Republican
members opposed.

Health. One of the top Republican legislative priorities for
the lame-duck session is the 21*t Century Cures bill, a
package of measures intended to spur new medical
treatments and boost funding for the National Institutes of
Health, the FDA, and White House initiatives such as
“precision medicine” and the Cancer Moonshot. Questions
remain in both the House and Senate over how to pay for
the bill and the size of the funding increases, but Senator
McConnell has said the bill “could end up being the most
significant piece of legislation we pass in the whole
Congress.”

On the House side, this continuesto be the top priority of
the Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee
Fred Upton. Leaders of the Energy and Commerce
Committee said on September 29 that they had been
“working hard for months, and we will continue to work
toward an agreement that can pass both chambers and be
signed by the President.” The House passed its version of
the 21% Century Cures bill (H.R. 6) in July 2015 by a vote
of 344-77, including nearly $9 billion in new research
funding for the NIH and reforms to the FDA’s process for
approving certain new medicines and medical devices. In
the Senate, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions
(HELP) Committee has passed a package of 19 bills aimed
at accelerating approval of new drugs and medical devices
and attracting talented researchers to the FDA, but the full
Senate has yet to consider the bills. HELP Committee
Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-TN) told Bloomberg BNA in
June that the impediments to passage are the proposals’
complexity and disagreements over how to pay for

them. Negotiationscontinue.

Speaker Ryan has also listed passage of mental health
legislation as one of his priorities for the lame-duck
session. H.R. 2646, a bill sponsored by Rep. Tim Murphy
(R-PA) that passed the House almost unanimously in July,
would expand Medicaid coverage of mental health
services, fund more psychiatric hospital beds and change
privacy rules to allow caregivers to receive more
information about patients.

under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B).
FACTS

Background of Request

Jeffrey Epstein is a billionaire financier, philanthropist, and sex offender. In 2005, Epstein
became the subject of an undercover sex trafficking investigation by Palm Beach, Florida
police and the FBI. Dozens of underage women were trafficked by Epstein to perform sexual
acts on him as well as his friends.

Despite the gravity of his offenses, the Department of Justice allowed Epstein to plead guilty
to a single count of soliciting prostitution from a minor under Florida state law, and serve
only 13 months in prison. In addition, prosecutors agreed not to bring charges against

Epstein’s alleged co-conspirators.

. Mr. Epstein enjoyed close ties to numerous prominent political figures, including former

President Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew of the British Royal Family, leading many to
speculate whether he received preferential treatment from authorities. See Goodnough, Abby,
“Questions of Preferential Treatment Are Raised in Florida Sex Case,” The New York Times,

Sep. 3, 2006. (Exhibit A)

FOIA Request and Constructive Denial
On April 20, 2017 James Robertson, a Senior Editor for The National Enquirer and sister-
publication Radar Online, submitted a FOIA request to the FBI for all documents relating to
the investigation and prosecution of Epstein (the “Request”). (Exhibit B)
Robertson requested expedited processing because Epstein’s crimes are the subject of
widespread and exceptional media interest, and raise questions about the government's

integrity, which affects public confidence; specifically, whether Mr. Epstein received

Biological Scientists Can Understand and Use Ideas and Methods of
Nonlinear Science

A yield of advances in computer hardware and software is that even quite
difficult applied nonlinear mathematics can become accessible to experimentally
oriented biological scientists. Before this time, the development and analysis of a
particular set of nonlinear differential equations, describing the actions of a
neurobiological system in motion, involved decades of specialty training, rare insight
and many hours of highly skilled, trial and error computations by hand. Since the
idiosyncrasies of each nonlinear system were considered unique, the results of their
analyses were thought to concern only the particular nonlinear system being
studied. Often a shift in hypothetical mechanism meant starting the long and painful
process all over again. In addition, these findings were usually communicated only
to a small and arcane mathematical community in the form of dense theorems and
difficult to follow proofs, insurmountable language barriers to biological researchers
wishing to use them to better describe and understand their experimental
observations.

For today’s neuroscientist with a desktop computer, an inclination to program
and access to computer algebra and numerical software such as Maple,
Mathematica or MatLab, operational definitions and computational empiricism can
replace the theorem and proof continuity required to do old style applied
mathematics. For those of us without sufficient facility in algebraic manipulation to
easily follow the arguments of professional mathematicians, a computer algebra
program such as Maple serves as a delightfully accessible consultant with which to

Saudi Arabia: beyond oil but not so fast
30 June 2016 Corrected
Unauthorized redistribution of this report is prohibited. This report is intended for amanda.ens@baml.com
Transforming Saudi Arabia, but challenges abound
The Saudi National Transformation Plan (NTP) bodes well for comprehensive reform
efforts to diversify the economy in line with Vision 2030. The NTP a) identifies key
sectors with high growth potential; b) starts to articulate supportive public sector
industrial strategies; and c) seeks to foster higher value-added through enhancements to
processes, products and organizations. Still, ambitious targets in a number of sectors are
unlikely to be reached and medium-term macro sustainability is not yet clear.
USD peg holds but NTP inconsistent with stable FX policy
Our view is still that the USD peg holds. However, the NTP provides a mixed message.
On the one hand, it blurs policymaking incentives given the need for a competitive Fx if
diversification progresses. On the other, unrealistic fiscal targets mean consolidation is
likely to fall short of easing imbalances materially without oil price recovery. Energy
policy thus likely needs to become less aggressive to support macro and FX policies.
Eurobond premium required for fiscal slippage risk
We expect large and regular sovereign Eurobond issuance to support FX reserves and
domestic liquidity but to weigh on regional bond spreads if risk appetite does not hold
up or fiscal balance slips. EMBIG index inclusion is unlikely, in our view. Saudi forwards,
CDS and rates are likely to stay under pressure due to issuance and tight liquidity.
Commodities: NTP adds to medium-term oil tightness
The NTP suggestion that production capacity is maintained until 2020 reinforces our
conviction of medium-term oil market tightness. The NTP gas production target that
could displace domestic crude demand and boost export capacity is challenging.
Equity Strategy: six investible themes on the back of NTP
We see a number of investible themes emerging from the NTP which investors can use
to identify potential beneficiaries. These themes include rising availability of affordable
housing, increased access to healthcare, down-trading as the consumer comes under
pressure, a surge in telecom infrastructure and significant opportunities in the
downstream petrochemical arena. Buy-rated names with access to these themes
include: Al Hammadi, Savola, Al Othaim, STC, Zain KSA and SABIC.
Partial NTP success & MSCI inclusion could drive rerating
The Saudi market trades on a 12m fwd P/E of c.13x, an 11% discount to the long-term
average and its lowest premium to GEMs since 2010. We believe that with earnings
momentum gradually reaching an inflection point a relatively negative outlook is already
being priced in. Given our view that oil prices will gain strong momentum in 2017, even
a partial success of the NTP along with CMA market reforms to expedite inclusion in the
MSCI EM index could be sufficient to improve confidence and thus drive a rerating.
Trading ideas and investment strategies discussed herein may give rise to significant risk and are not
suitable for all investors. Investors should have experience in FX markets and the financial resources to
absorb any losses arising from applying these ideas or strategies.

Jean-Michel Saliba

jean-michel.saliba@baml.com
The Saudi Vision 2030 and National Transformation Plan (NTP) present a
comprehensive roadmap for change and augur for committed diversification efforts, in
our view. Announced reforms can help sustain higher potential growth if fully realized as
new sectoral sources of growth are developed. Positively, the NTP borrows elements
from other successful strategic case studies. Still, we find a number of targets
ambitious or unrealistic on the fiscal and diversification fronts, and the sequencing and
details of the fiscal measures are left nebulous.
In terms of the other pillars of the macro view, namely energy and Fx policy, the NTP
presents a mixed picture, in our view. Energy policy is likely to be less aggressive, as the
NTP suggests a constant oil production capacity. To remain consistent with the targeted
government debt accumulation path, we estimate that oil prices have to average at least
US$50/bbl in 2016-20 along with no growth in spending (excluding the additional cost
of NTP initiatives). Partial implementation could require oil prices of cUS$65/bbl.
Fiscal consolidation remains imperative to support the Fx peg, in line with stability and
economic imperatives. However, as diversification progresses, the case for increased Fx
flexibility to support competitiveness could likely gradually take shape. Policy-making
growth-focused plans may conflict with needs to deflate Fx demand in the economy.
Towards better governance
The comprehensive economic blueprint unveiled by the Saudi Vision 2030 and the
National Transformation Plan (NTP) confirms the economic reform credentials of the
current administration. It is likely to improve government culture, accountability and
transparency, in our view. The NTP will be implemented across 24 government bodies
and has been presented through a number of press conferences with high-level
ministerial presentations. The Governance Framework details steps to institutionalize
and coordinate implementation through restructuring the government. It proposes a
number of committees and bodies to report to the Council for Economic and
Development Affairs (CEDA). It also introduces an escalation mechanism to rapidly
resolve bottlenecks, which could see matters escalated to CEDA in 42 days.
A wide-ranging policy-making reshuffle
In line with ongoing Saudi Vision 2030 implementation efforts, a wide-ranging
restructuring of the Saudi Cabinet and government bodies was announced in May to
drive change in the government. King Salman issued 51 Royal Decrees restructuring the
Cabinet, various government bodies and appointing a number of officials into various
government roles. A statement concurrently issued by the Royal Court suggested these
changes are in line with the recently announced Saudi Vision 2030 and aim to support
its implementation. This follows from the January 2015 restructuring of the bodies
affiliated to the Council of Ministers, which saw the creation of CEDA and the Council
for Political and Security Affairs. We list a few major changes below.

The appointment of Khalid Al-Falih to the Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral
Resources is not surprising, given that former Minister of Petroleum and Mineral
Resources Al-Naimi has previously suggested he was approaching retirement due to old
age. Al-Falih’s appointment continues the tradition of non-Royals heading the Ministry,
while simultaneously holding the Chairmanship role of Saudi Aramco. Furthermore,
according to local press, Al-Falih appears close to Deputy Crown Prince Mohamed bin
Salman, and his appointment likely confirms the recently assertive Royal influence over
energy policy, in our view. New Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources Al-
Falih’s past official pronouncements are consistent with stable Saudi energy policy, in
our view.
GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 3
Expanded role for the Oil Ministry under Vision 2030
The Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources has been expanded to become the
Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources. It will be dedicated for energy, in
addition to expanding to encompass responsibilities relating to electricity and industry.
It will also undertake the management of the National Industrial Cluster Development
Program (NICDP). The new Minister will chair the board of directors of the Royal
Commission for Jubail and Yanbu, the Industrial Development Fund, the Saudi
Organization for Industrial Estates and Technology Zones, the Saudi Geological Survey,
the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology, the Saudi Exports Development
Authority and the King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy.
Energy sector liberalization drives non-oil diversification
The wider role for the Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources is in line with
the expanded industrial responsibilities foreseen for Saudi Aramco in the Vision 2030. It
may also suggest a continued desire to liberalize the energy sector. The National
Industrial Cluster Development Program (NICDP), established in October 2012 by the
Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources and the Ministry of Commerce and
Industry, could likely gain further importance in the industrialization strategy adopted in
the Vision 2030. The NICDP will be managed by the Ministry of Energy. It seeks to
leverage Saudi Arabia’s comparative advantage in energy, petrochemicals and minerals
to create sustainable export oriented industries, initially focused on the automotive,
construction material, appliances, metal processing and flexible packaging sectors.
Restructuring the Cabinet and other government bodies
The Ministry of Commerce and Industry will become the Ministry of Commerce and
Investment and sees the appointment of a new Minister. The new Minister will chair the
board of directors of the General Authority for Investment, the General Authority for
Small and Medium Enterprises and the Saudi Standards, Metrology and Quality
Organization. The Ministry of Labor will be merged with the Ministry of Social Affairs to
form the Ministry of Labor and Social Development, and sees the appointment of a new
Minister. The Ministry of Water and Electricity has been disbanded. The Ministry of
Agriculture was renamed the Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture and
expands its responsibilities into these areas. Two new Ministers for Transport and
Health were appointed. The Ministry of Hajj has been renamed the Ministry of Hajj and
Umrah and sees the appointment of a new Minister.
The Saudi Fund for Development will now report to the Council for Economic and
Development Affairs. The General Authority for Entertainment and the General Authority
for Culture have been created. The Department of Zakat and Income Tax was renamed
the General Authority for Zakat and Income, and will report to the Ministry of Finance.
New Central Bank Governor maintains commitment to USD peg
Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) Governor Al-Mubarak has been replaced in his
post by SAMA Deputy Governor for Research and International Affairs Dr. Al-Kholifey. A
number of officials were also appointed into various government and advisory roles.
New SAMA Governor Al-Kholifey’s past policy pronouncements suggest continued
commitment to the USD peg.
Watch the Saudi Fund for Development
The Saudi Fund for Development (SFD) new direct link to the Council for Economic and
Development Affairs likely concentrates further authority in the Deputy Crown, in our
view. Given that the Public Investment Fund (PIF) last saw similar links being established
prior to plans being made for it to be turned into a Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF), this
could suggest further strategic changes may take place at the SFD.

A web of Strategic Programs
Saudi Vision 2030 incorporates a number of Executive Programs and initiatives, with
implementation carried out by several government entities. The Vision continues to
centralize decision-making into CEDA, chaired by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman, and reporting to the Council of Ministers. The Ministry of Economy and
Planning also retains an important role, with lower emphasis being put on the Ministry
of Finance. The Project Management Program also suggests emphasis on ongoing
review of capital expenditures, whereby existing review served to examine their approval
process, and control their level. From a macro perspective, the three most important
programs for now are: a) the re-shaping of the Public Investment Fund (PIF) into a
US$2trn Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF); b) the new corporate strategy for Saudi Aramco
to transform it into an energy and industrial conglomerate; and, c) the National
Transformation Plan (NTP) which encompasses medium-term growth boosting
initiatives and fiscal consolidation measures (alongside the Fiscal Balance and
Privatization Programs). We discuss these three elements in turn below.

Public Investment Fund to gain prominence
The restructuring of the Public Investment Fund (PIF) is likely to allow greater focus on
achieving a diversified foreign asset base which could support in turn the build-up of
non-oil revenues. According to Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman,
government ownership of Saudi Aramco would be transferred to the PIF, which will be
transformed into a SWF that will look to increase its overseas assets (from 5% of total
to 50% of total by 2020) following its recapitalization and the proceeds of Aramco IPO.
The PIF would hold on-paper a vast amount of wealth post-IPO (US$2trn, according to
the Deputy Crown Prince, the bulk of which would be Saudi Aramco) as ownership of
Saudi Aramco is transferred to the PIF, but it would only be able to deploy the cash
proceeds of the monetized Aramco stake in the near-term, in our view. We think the
PIF’s transformation is still at a relatively early stage for now.
Room to grow PIF stature and budget contribution
The restructuring of the PIF is likely to allow further diversification of foreign assets,
which will in turn increase the share of investment income in the budget over time. We
estimate that in 2015 investment income transferred to the budget stood at US$9.9bn
(1.5% of GDP), which entails transfers of US$4bn from the PIF and US$5bn from SAMA.
These transfers pale in comparison to the estimated budgetary contributions among
main GCC peers. We estimate that the rate of return (investment income) on foreign
assets of SAMA, government entities and the private sector averaged c2% over the past
8 years, which already suggests some exposure to riskier asset classes, in our view. As
the PIF gains importance, it will become more prominent in the examination of the
breakdown of the Saudi Net International Investment Position .
Transitioning to an Abu Dhabi model
It will be interesting to see how the restructuring of the PIF into an SWF works out in
practice. We hypothesise that it may be that, on top of the monetization of Aramco's
stake sale, PIF could get a portion of the assets of SAMA. In this scenario, we would
effectively transition to the Abu Dhabi and Kuwait model where the central bank holds
little reserves and non-transparent SWFs are what matters both in terms of flow and
stock. Foreign assets purchases of the PIF would also have to be managed within the
overall Balance of Payments (BoP) framework as they could lead to drains on SAMA
reserves in the near term. Over time, Saudi Arabia could decide to emulate the Norway
model, which would entail a more prudent use and conduct of fiscal policy, in our view.

PIF largely a domestic inward-looking entity until recently
The IMF reports that the PIF had assets of 11.1% of GDP in 2014 (c.SAR310bn). PIF has
foreign assets of SAR14.1bn as of end-2015. It has outstanding loans of SAR103.9bn as
of 3Q15 (excluding electricity loans of SAR14bn that PIF administers). According to
Bloomberg, PIF had stakes in publicly listed companies on Tadawul worth SAR934bn as
of April 2016. According to the MoF, PIF held equity worth SAR63.3bn in 41 Saudi
companies in total at end-2011, as well as stakes worth SAR14.9bn in a number of pan-
Arab corporations.
In July 2014, the cabinet authorized the PIF to establish companies inside and outside
Saudi Arabia, alone or in partnership with other institutions from the public or private
sectors. It also bought a US$1.1bn stake in a South Korean company and recently
announced in early June it took a US$3.5bn stake in Uber, denying in the process that it
was considering a US$3bn loan to fund the acquisition. PIF has been asked to co-invest
US$10bn in Russia or the Middle East with the RIDF. Note that PIF has established
Sanabil investments with SAR20bn in capital. The PIF has paid dividends to the budget
last year (SAR15bn). It now reports directly to the Council of Economic and
Development Affairs headed by the Deputy Crown Prince, after reporting to the Ministry
of Finance in the past.
JASTA bill not a hurdle for further Saudi investment in the US
We expect that the deep and liquid US financial markets will remain a prominent
destination for Saudi foreign asset holdings. The potential passage of the “9/11” bill
(Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, JASTA) in US Congress raises the possibility
that Saudi Arabia would choose to liquidate up to US$750bn in assets in the US,
according to Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir. A forced and rapid liquidation of USbased
Saudi foreign assets may expose SAMA and other government entities to markto-market
losses, and require changes to Fx reserve management
The language of the JASTA bill as it currently stands does not suggest an imminent
Saudi sell-off of US assets, in our view. The “Stay of Actions Pending State
Negotiations” section inserted into the bill allows a stay to be granted for an indefinitely
renewable 180-day period. This would be subject to court petition by the Attorney
General and repeated certification by the Secretary of State that the US is “engaged in
good faith discussions with the foreign state defendant concerning the resolution of the
claims against the foreign state”. The certification thus depends on the current and
future US administration foreign policy inclinations, in our view. Separately, we note
that the White House spokesman said US President Obama did not support the
legislation and likely would not sign it. (A potential presidential veto may however still
be overruled if Congress assembles the necessary two–thirds vote of each house). We
continue to expect a close relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia given the
confluence of interests in a broad range of matters.

GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 9
Historic energy sector liberalization
Partial privatization of energy sector assets could represent one of the cornerstones of
the ambitious medium-term diversification strategy, and, if confirmed, serve as a highly
visible and historic milestone. Such privatizations could ease key macro concerns
regarding unsustainable debt accumulation and Fx reserves drawdown. We believe it
would also confirm the government’s macro reform credentials, its preparedness for a
prolonged period of low oil prices and likely signal no near-term energy policy
capitulation. The NTP suggestion of a flat production capacity through 2020 suggests
less aggressive market share strategy, in our view.
Privatization of energy sector could start by 2018
In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman outlined an array of measures the Saudi government could introduce to help
diversify the economy, reduce its reliance on the hydrocarbon industry and ultimately
support medium-term fiscal consolidation in a low oil price environment. Amongst these
measures, the Deputy Crown Prince included a potential Initial Public Offering (IPO) of
Saudi Aramco (at the parent level, and including various subsidiaries). With close to
250bn bbls of oil reserves, more than 10mn bbls per day of production and the world’s
4th largest gas reserves, Saudi Aramco is the leader in hydrocarbon access among state
owned, private and public Oil & Gas (O&G) companies alike. Saudi Aramco is the world’s
largest Oil & Gas Company by production and arguably the Kingdom’s most important
asset. Specifically, he outlined a plan that would see “less than 5%” of the company
being sold to investors on the Saudi stock exchange no later than 2018 (but potentially
as soon as 2017). Furthermore, he indicated the Kingdom is seeking to transform
Aramco into an “energy-industrial company”. The high profile stake sale would provide a
highly visible anchor to diversification efforts and capitalize its newly restructured SWF.
Energy assets form a major and strategic sector for the economy
It is hard not to understate the central role the energy sector plays in the Saudi
economy. The hydrocarbon sector represented 43.0% of the economy in real terms in
2015. Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman suggested a US$2trn price tag for
Saudi Aramco in his Bloomberg interview. Aramco is deeply intertwined with the Saudi
state, and its workforce Saudization has increased over the years to 83%. Furthermore,
it is the foundation of its state’s domestic and international energy policy. As such, a
decision to partially privatize the energy sector will be a momentous one to be carefully
examined by the technocratic and political leadership, in our view.
More questions than answers at this stage
Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s initial suggestion in an interview with
The Economist that a Saudi Aramco IPO could be considered has raised market
expectations. Ensuing comments from Aramco’s management did not make clear
whether a listing would occur, and if so, in what form (upstream versus downstream),
although the Deputy Crown Prince’s subsequent Bloomberg interview suggested further
impetus being given to studying the matter.
A listing of the entity itself may force much more transparency regarding hydrocarbon
reserves (broadly unchanged for several years), lifting costs (local crude oil sales suggest
cUS$5/bbl if no loss is incurred) and the fiscal regime (estimates in the press have
suggested that Aramco’s profits are taxed at 85%, with royalties set at 20%, but we
also note from fiscal data that the fiscal transfer ratio in oil revenues to the Ministry of
Finance appears to drop in years of low oil prices). It may also conflict with noncommercial
ventures or strategic aspects of Saudi Aramco. This would include the
maintaining of spare capacity and state policy matters (including energy policy). Note
for instance that the US is the second regional destination for Saudi crude oil exports
(17.5% of total Saudi crude oil exports) behind Asia. This was due to a strategic
geopolitical decision to remain an important crude oil supplier to the US and was
achieved through the buying of stakes in refineries in 1988.

Oil sector privatization could slow debt build-up and support Fx reserves
Potential energy sector asset partial privatization could raise a substantial amount for
the Saudi government, in our view. A share sale would be a non-debt creating financing
flow for the budget, which would lessen the need to borrow domestically or externally. A
share sale could also increase Saudi Arabia’s ability to project soft power and influence
regionally and internationally. However, it would only support the build-up of Fx reserves
in the case of foreign investor participation. Assuming a US$2trn valuation suggested
by the Deputy Crown Prince as the value for the SWF, the vast majority of which would
be Aramco through a possible 5% listing, such a listing could raise up cUS$100bn, which
would represent the current annual government borrowing requirements and associated
Fx reserves drawdown. We expect further administered energy price adjustments over
the next five years, which should increase state revenues, in our view.
A share sale may also facilitate international borrowing on the back of Saudi Aramco’s
balance sheet. Saudi Aramco also announced it would look to set up a corporate debt
program to fund its NTP initiatives, although issuance does not appear to be an
immediate prospect. A corporate debt program, alongside a sovereign one, could allow
the government to simultaneously tap a new pool of liquidity through corporate bond
investors, upstream proceeds if needed and support Fx reserves. This could be achieved
without impacting central government debt ratios and without saturating the
government debt issuance room with sovereign debt investors. Saudi Aramco raised a
US$10bn syndicated loan in late March 2015 in part to fund acquisitions. The loan
replaced US$4bn in existing facilities agreed to in 2010, and includes a US$6bn fiveyear
tranche with two 1-year extension options, a US$1bn 1-year renewable facility, a
non-interest bearing SAR7.5bn (US$2bn) five-year tranche with two 1-year extension
options and a SAR3.75bn (US$1bn) 1-year tranche renewable yearly.
Very roughly, taking the US$2trn Deputy Crown Prince potential valuation for Aramco,
and assuming an optimal 10% net-debt-to-equity medium-term target, it would suggest
that Aramco could manage leverage of up to US$200bn (c30% of GDP) in domestic and
external debt on its balance sheet. Within a corporate setting, possible higher gearing
needs to be justified to shareholders and could reflect financing of acquisitions or NTP
costs. From a macro angle, international issuance would support Fx reserves.
Three aspects of energy policy to consider going forward
Energy sector privatization is likely to raise questions on the future path of energy
policy, though we believe the latter will stay the course for now. We believe that are
three aspects that are central to energy policy in Saudi Arabia: a) competition for global
market share in upstream operations; b) future investment decisions and maintaining of
spare capacity buffer; and c) integration and expansion of downstream ventures to
create domestic jobs, secure captive crude demand and make operations less volatile.
GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 11
Targeting a stable oil price
As a matter of Saudi policy, we would expect a preference for oil market stability over
volatility, in line with recent official pronouncements. Although volatility makes it more
difficult for high cost unconventional producers to operate, volatility is also damaging
for Saudi Arabia and long-term planning domestically. For instance, no budget was
announced for 1986 due to uncertainties in the world oil market, with monthly current
appropriations set at one-twelfth of estimated actual expenditures for the prior year.
We think Saudi authorities view possible eventual sharp upward price spikes in the oil
price as damaging to both oil-consuming and oil-producing countries.
Future investment decisions will be critical for oil prices
Spare capacity is an important policy parameter for Saudi Arabia. In addition to its
influence on prices through its ability to adjust production, Saudi can decide on the pace
of its reserves development which would potentially affect future supply. There are
distinct trade-offs in this decision. If Saudi Arabia is producing at close to its maximum
capacity, it will have little control over sharp upside movements in oil prices. If excess
capacity is large, oil prices are likely to be under downward pressure.
In the near-term, given the uncertainty in the market, in our view, there is likely little
incentive for Saudi Arabia to embark on a program to invest and increase capacity from
the current level. New investments may still be made to offset declines in existing
fields. Over time however, our commodities research medium-term oil balances suggest
that Saudi’s spare capacity would be eroded over time unless further increases in spare
capacity take place. Our BofAML commodities research medium-term supply-demand
balances suggest an increased call on OPEC and need to increase production capacity. In
2004-09, Aramco invested cUS$100bn into its largest-ever capacity expansion program,
which increased total capacity from 10mn bpd to 12.5mn bpd. For now, Aramco has
suggested it will not slow down its hydrocarbon capex program for the next three years
as cuts were achieving through savings in drilling costs and supplier discounts.
Energy policy is likely to be less aggressive going forward
We expect a less aggressive energy policy going forward, particularly as the NTP
suggests a constant oil production capacity and an increase in gas production
domestically. This is in line with Saudi Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral
Resources Al-Falih’s pronouncements during the June Ordinary OPEC meeting. While his
comments served to project increased OPEC institutional credibility and increased
rapprochement with fellow OPEC members, he suggested that Saudi Arabia will remain
responsive to customer needs but dismissed fears that increasing Saudi market share
would take place in an aggressive manner (that could drive prices lower again).
Downstream operations - increased focus
Saudi Aramco’s downstream integration drive is likely being pursued for two core
reasons: (1) to support demand for Saudi crude (placing own crude in own refining
capacity) and (2) a risk reduction mechanism in a highly volatile oil environment (having
an integrated value chain allows capture of margins from well to the forecourt,
promoting stability). In reflection, Saudi Aramco is building highly sophisticated
refineries domestically, in addition to already completed joint-ventures and stakes in
refineries abroad (China, US, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia). Domestic joint-venture (JV)
refineries Satorp and Yasref added 400k bpd each of capacity in 2H14. With the
completion of the fully-owned Jazan 400k bpd refinery in 2018/19, overall total refinery
capacity would stand at 5.7mn bpd, of which Saudi Aramco’s share would be 3.3mn bpd.
This would allow Saudi Arabia to guarantee security of demand for its heavy crude,
increase domestic job creation and diversification, build an export base of refined
products (likely middle distillates to the EU) and lower imports of refined products.
12 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016
National Transformation Plan: many promises, few details
The National Transformation Plan (NTP) released by the Saudi government is a further
step towards execution of Saudi Vision 2030 through a set of ambitious interim targets
to achieve by 2020 by 24 government bodies. The NTP is a comprehensive program
encompassing medium-term growth boosting initiatives and fiscal consolidation
measures. The sequencing and details of the fiscal measures are however still left
nebulous. Implementation of growth-boosting initiatives will require a challenging
crowding in of private sector investment, particularly from domestic sources.
The NTP is likely to introduce a number of one-off supply-side shocks to inflation
through its fiscal or labor measures, which could negatively impact Real Effective
Exchange Rate (REER) competitiveness. Discretionary consumption growth and real
incomes are likely to remain under pressure. We find the diversification measures
encouraging, although they appear too ambitious to be met within the time frame
envisaged in the NTP, in our view. The focus on diversification could introduce mediumterm
incentives to adopt a more competitive exchange rate, while also detracting from
the binding fiscal constraint under which the government has to operate. Energy policy
is likely to be less aggressive and support oil prices. Fiscal targets are difficult to reach,
but medium-term oil prices of at least US$50-65/bbl could support NTP progress.

Ambitious diversification agenda is not without risks
Diversification initiatives will require material participation from the private sector.
Vested interests and the large bureaucracy could act as a dampener on timely reform
implementation going forward. The large size of the NTP program may mean some of
its outcomes are internally inconsistent, in our view. Cultural and entertainment changes
could be opposed by conservative or clerical factions. Slippage could occur due to
execution risk or reform fatigue, particularly due to the socio-economic impact of fiscal
consolidation. Any material changes to subsidies or wages could be difficult to
implement in the absence of a social safety net. While fiscal consolidation measures are
unprecedented in scope, they appear too ambitious or difficult to reach and may leave a
financing gap. As such, the measures may still fall short if oil prices do not stabilize,
which suggests a need for a less aggressive energy policy going forward, in our view.
Government leaders continue to show focus on delivery
The US visit of Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and finalization of various
Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with prominent US corporates helps provide a
highly visible anchor for foreign investment and instil business confidence in regards to
government focus. It also helps boost the profile of the Deputy Crown Prince both
domestically and internationally. This is in line with our view that the government is
likely to target rapid implementation of several ‘low-hanging’ reforms to spearhead the
program and boost confidence. Energy sector liberalization could also serve as another
highly visible anchor to the reform program, in our view.

Diversification drive is a step in the right direction
The comprehensive medium-term diversification drive introduced by the NTP follows
the typical macro template, in our view. We discuss in a later section diversification
lessons from Malaysia and Norway and conclude that the NTP contains elements from
these successful case studies. In particular, it a) identifies key sectors with relatively
high growth potential (mining, petrochemicals, manufacturing, retail and wholesale
trade, religious and other forms of tourism, healthcare, real estate and finance); b), it
starts to articulate supportive public sector industrial strategies, including through
localization policies; and, c) it seeks to foster higher-value added in the economy
through enhancements to processes, products and organizations.

Human capital is critical and takes time to build
In our view, improvements to human capital, rather than business climate supply-side
reforms, are the critical barriers to overcome. While building the appropriately qualified
workforce takes time, Saudi Arabia has been making progress in this area. c25% of
Saudi tertiary graduates complete humanities and arts programs, but this is down from
39.4% in 1999. Graduates from social sciences, business and law represented the
largest share of graduates at 27.2% of total in 2014, up from 15.5% in 1999. Still, as we
discuss in later sections, diversification prospects are mixed across sectors and will
likely depend in part on providing the appropriate incentives to the private sector.

Mobilizing domestic resources is key
The NTP makes clear that part of the NTP costs (40%) will need to be shouldered by the
private sector. Out of a total estimated NTP cost of SAR447bn (US$119bn; 18.4% of
GDP), the NTP implies that the private sector will need to contribute about SAR179bn
over the coming five years (US$47.6bn; 7.4% of GDP). Implementation of growthboosting
initiatives will require a challenging crowding in of private sector investment.
The NTP expects only a SAR40bn increase in the level of Foreign Direct Investment
(FDI), meaning that the bulk of private sector investment could have to come from
domestic sources. While the government investment is generally in retrenchment mode,
the NTP may be suggesting that selective and strategic projects are likely to go ahead.
Authorities have also suggested a number of projects could be structured as Public-
Private Partnerships (PPP).

Ambitious non-oil export and tourism targets, but little details
The NTP targets increasing non-oil exports by SAR145bn (US$38bn, 6.0% of GDP) to
SAR330bn (US$88bn, 11.4% of 2020f GDP) over the next five years. Although
implementation details are lacking, we anticipate that part of the increase could be
linked to the higher mining output targeted. These would nevertheless be dependent on
the global economic cycle. Higher exports of refined oil products, if all of the additional
capacity to be installed by 2020 is exported, could add cUS$7.3bn to exports at current
price levels (but not qualify towards non-oil exports targets under the NTP as they are
classified as hydrocarbon exports). Currently, 61% of Saudi non-oil exports represents
chemicals and plastics, and maintains a correlation with oil prices, and re-exports
account for another 17% of total non-oil exports and have little added-value.

Likewise, the focus on religious tourism is appropriate given its importance in Saudi
Arabia but NTP targets appear ambitious to us with a targeted 20%yoy CAGR increase
in Umrah pilgrims. Religious tourism accounted for c40% of total tourist expenditure in
Saudi Arabia in 2015, bringing in proceeds of SAR33.4bn (US$8.9bn; 1.4% of GDP). Note
that, for balance of payment purposes, total tourism revenues stood instead at
SAR37.9bn (US$10.1bn; 1.6% of GDP). The NTP targets would thus imply religious
tourism external revenues/expenditures to increase to US$10-US$20bn (1.3-2.6% of
2020f GDP). This would be helpful on the external front but not a game changer on its
own, in our view.

Mixed prospects for fiscal consolidation
The apparent redistribution of part of the proceeds of the flagship fiscal measures
towards funding the NTP initiatives suggests that the fiscal consolidation efforts could
fall short of the necessary requirement to narrow imbalances materially in the absence
of a sustained oil price recovery. We calculate that the NTP targets a total net
cumulative fiscal consolidation effort of SAR648bn (US$172.8bn) or c1% of GDP
annually, assuming progressive and full implementation of the non-oil revenue targets.
Energy policy needs to support economic transformation
Energy policy is likely to be less aggressive going forward, particularly as the NTP
suggests a constant oil production capacity as well as an increase in gas production
domestically which could free up domestic crude for exports. To remain consistent with
the targeted government debt accumulation path, we estimate that oil prices have to
average at least US$50/bbl in 2016-20 along with no growth in spending from 2016
levels (excluding the additional cost of NTP initiatives but including implementation of
the NTP non-oil revenue measures). Oil prices of at least cUS$65/bbl would be required
if spending is not disciplined or revenue targets are missed by c50%, in our view.
Blueprint for fiscal measures lacks details
The approved NTP initiatives will have a total fiscal cost of SAR268bn (US$71.5bn;
11.6% of GDP) spread over five years (annually, SAR54bn equivalent to US$14.3bn or
2.3% of GDP). Government financing could represent 60% of total funding needs for the
NTP initiatives, with total NTP costs of SAR447bn (US$119bn; 18.4% of GDP). Against
that, the NTP envisages raising SAR366bn in non-oil revenues and cut the wage bill by
5% or SAR24bn (US$6.4bn or 1% of GDP). Non-oil revenue is seen rising to SAR530bn
(US$141bn, 23% of 2016f GDP) by 2020 from SAR163.5bn (7% of GDP).
Wage bill measure unclear but may carry profound social implications
In an unprecedented austerity measure, the share of the wage bill in total spending
would fall by 5ppt to 40% (SAR456bn, from SAR480bn) by 2020. It is yet unclear how
this could be achieved in practice. Furthermore, note that the MoF budget
announcement estimated the wage bill in 2015 to stand at SAR450bn, blurring the
target. Privatizations of government entities are likely to lead to a natural drop in the
public sector number of employees and wage bill. Yet we note that the Ministry of Civil
Service has two Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) directly linked to a decrease in the
payroll and benefits expenditure, and to a reduction in workers in the civil service sector.
This would likely be a contentious and unpopular measure to implement, and its
implementation and success appear challenging to us.
GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 17
Spending path is unclear and is flattish (excluding NTP costs) in the best case
The spending path targeted or assumed by the NTP is unclear and does not appear to
match realized outturns. It may suggest that spending is likely to remain flattish,
excluding NTP costs. However, the indicative level spending would settle at is around
peak 2014 expenditures levels and well above the 2015 realized spending and 2016
budgeted levels. While 2015 spending could have been understated and may be revised
higher, at least SAR88bn from the 2015 spending is non-recurrent as it relates to the
one-off Saudi Royal edicts decreed upon King Salman’s accession.
Going by the indicated 2020 target for the share of the wage bill in total spending, this
would suggest that government spending is targeted at SAR1,140bn in 2020. This
represents a 2.7% increase over peak 2014 spending levels and 16.5% increase over
2015 actual spending levels. Excluding the NTP annual costs, this suggests that
government spending should still increase by 11% over 2015 levels and drop by 2% over
2014 spending in nominal terms.
In our view, given the lack of precise spending targets, one way of remaining consistent
is to use the two NTP figures for wages and infer the NTP fiscal spending from the
stated share of wages in total expenditures. This would suggest that fiscal expenditures
would reach SAR1,140bn in 2020, from SAR1,067bn in the base year (unstated in the
NTP). This is a 6.8% increase, but excluding the NTP costs, is just 1.8% higher. As such,
in the best case scenario, we think the NTP suggests flattish spending, excluding NTP
costs. If we instead take the NTP level of spending inferred to be the correct amount,
this would materially widen the fiscal deficit by SAR190bn (8.0% of GDP) and would be
deeply negative for the sustainability of the fiscal and Fx stance, in our view.
Fiscal adjustment burden shifts to raising revenue, oil prices and exports
The possible flattish spending implication of the NTP would tend to indicate that the
bulk of the spending cuts are now beyond us. Government projects are likely to continue
to be prioritized, likely according to their economic benefits and relevance to the NTP.
Flattish spending will thus shift the burden of forthcoming fiscal adjustment on raising
non-oil revenues, raising hydrocarbon exports and a sustained recovery in oil prices.

18 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016
Focus on increasing non-hydrocarbon fiscal revenue could fall short of target
The breakdown of measures to raise non-oil revenues is not given. However, the tally is
close to the US$100bn targeted in the Vision 2030 and is thus likely to include
measures discussed then: hikes to administered energy prices, review of current levels
of fees and fines, introduction of new fees, land tax (we estimate annual revenues of
1.5-2% of GDP in its first phase when fully implemented). In this regard, the NTP
suggests forthcoming privatizations, imposition of taxes on harmful products (likely
tobacco and soft drinks), introduction of a Value-Added Tax (VAT) for which we estimate
annual revenues of up to 2% of GDP, implementation of a unified income tax and of an
income tax on residents (although official comments later clarified there were no plans
to tax nationals but stayed equivocal regarding expatriates).
Although there is no direct budgetary impact, water and electricity subsidies are
targeted to decrease by SAR200bn. Non-oil subsidies are targeted to decrease by 20%
by 2020. The latter, we believe, consists largely of subsidies for social and sports clubs,
private education, private hospitals, and other agricultural subsidies. They were
budgeted at SAR3.9bn (US$1.0bn; 0.2% of GDP) in 2016, down from SAR15.0bn
(US$4.0bn; 0.6% of GDP) in 2015. A 20% cut to these on-budget non-oil subsidies would
thus generate minimal savings of US$0.2-US$0.8bn (0.1-0.5% of GDP) depending if the
reference base year was 2015 or 2016.
According to the Deputy Crown Prince pronouncements early in the year, medium-term
plans are also likely to target the introduction of US$400bn of unutilized state assets
(land, etc) to state-owned funds, with the latter in turn in charge of developing them
into projects and companies than can be IPOed to the public. In our view, this may be
linked to the Ministry of Finance assigned KPI of increasing total recorded non-oil
assets (real estate, etc) from SAR3trn to SAR5trn.
The Deputy Crown Prince provided a breakdown of the government target of raising
US$100bn in additional non-oil revenue annually by 2020. The bulk of this increase in
non-oil revenue would come from the restructuring of subsidies which could generate
US$30bn per year (4.9% of GDP), according to the Deputy Crown Prince. VAT
implementation, a Green Card-like program and a plan to allow corporates to hire
foreign workers in excess of their official quotas could bring in US$10bn (1.6% of GDP)
a year by 2020, according to the Deputy Crown Prince.

Further energy subsidy reform is likely
The figures announced by the Deputy Crown Prince regarding proceeds of subsidy
reform suggests material changes over the next 3-4 years, with annual savings close to
the landmark first round of administered price changes in late 2015. However, his
suggestion that the changes could be accompanied by partially offsetting cash transfers
to poor households suggests policy-making caution. We do not think such a
redistributive system could be technically put in place in a short time span.
Recall that concurrently with the 2016 budget, a first round of energy subsidy reform
saw sweeping energy, water and electricity administered price changes being instituted
in late December. We estimated the natural gas price hike on petrochemical firms,
domestic crude oil price hike as well as the combined gasoline and diesel price hike
introduced could add US$2.2bn, US$2.0bn and US$3.8bn to central government
revenues if fully passed to the budget (a combined 1.2% of GDP). Impact of continued
similar policies on domestic prices would be a further 1.5-2ppt annual increase in
headline inflation, and a gradual squeeze to household incomes (where gasoline, water
and electricity likely represented c.1.5%, c0.4% and 1.6% respectively of consumer
spending basket prior to the late December 2015 administered price adjustments).

Fiscal consolidation plan looks challenging to fully achieve
The US$100bn target in additional non-oil revenue through 2020 appears difficult to
reach and is likely to leave a sizeable financing gap based on the current proposals, in
20 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016
our view. This would thus imply that fiscal consolidation is likely to fall short of
narrowing imbalances materially without a sustained oil price recovery.
The fees on excess foreign worker quotas and the green-card like program targeted
proceeds are difficult to reach, in our view. We calculate that to raise US$10bn from a
green-card like program, authorities will need to set the program fees at US$1,500 (in
line with upper bound of similar programs elsewhere) and have all expatriate workers
applying to enrol in the program. This appears an unrealistic target to meet, particularly
as it is not clear how these proceeds would be recurrent yearly. As for the foreign
worker quotas proceeds, we calculate that, based on private sector expatriate figures
and the stated 85% overall compliance with Nitaqat sector quotas, that the fees would
need to be set at a large cUS$10,500 per non-compliant worker to be consistent with
the NTP target. The large fee amount would likely be a material disincentive to private
sector corporates and a squeeze on their profits.
One of the obstacles to meeting the subsidy reform target is likely to be political in
nature given the impact on inflation and household incomes. We calculate nevertheless
that the target could be reached through a combination of a administered prices
changes. We do not think there is major room to increase natural gas feedstock prices
to petrochemical firms, given the NTP focus on the petrochemical sector as a source of
future growth. We estimate raising natural gas prices to US spot levels in an oil price
environment of US$50/bbl would bring in revenues to the central government of just
US$2.5bn (0.4% of GDP) if fully passed to the budget. This is likely to suggest that the
bulk of the future adjustments are likely to center on hikes to administered price
adjustments for domestic crude oil sales, diesel and gasoline. Selling domestic crude at
US$25/bbl rather than an average of US$5.4/bbl would bring in US$20.8bn in revenues.
Gasoline and diesel prices could rise by the same percentage as in December 2015 to
bring in additional revenues for a minimum inflation pick-up cost of 0.5ppt.
The most difficult part would be meeting the US$40bn in other non-oil revenues target,
in our view. Given that the latter’s breakdown was not provided, we have attempted to
group several measures being studied (according to local press) to provide a tentative
decomposition. Still, our analysis suggests the need for a further US$16.8-US$20.7bn in
financing to meet the US$40bn target. Land tax proceeds of US$11bn in the first phase
of implementation are the largest item, in our view. We calculate that a 20% sin tax on
tobacco and sugary drinks would raise US$2.1bn (0.3% of GDP) at a 0.5ppt cost to
inflation. A remittance tax being studied, according to local press, and could impose a
tax of 6% gradually decline to 2% over a number of years. At the upper bound of the tax
rate (6%), we calculate that the remittance tax would raise US$2.3bn (0.4% of GDP). We
calculate that a 10% income tax on expatriates would raise at least between US$3.9-
US$7.8bn (0.6-1.2% of GDP), depending on the assumed annual overall expatriate
earnings. That being said, measures to tax expatriates could be detrimental to
diversification and labor force prospects and were opposed to politically in the past.

Budgeted defence spending – up or down
Localization policies in the defence industry could help cut imports (total defence
imports of US$9.8bn equivalent to US$1.5bn or 6% of total imports in 2015, according
to consultancy IHS) and conserve Fx reserves, but we expect this to be a slow and
gradual process. We think that large defense imports are typically amortized over a
number of years. Defence spending is an important part of fiscal spending in Saudi
Arabia, accounting for c30% of total budgeted spending. Defence spending in 2016 was
budgeted at SAR213bn (US$56.9bn; 9.0% of GDP), down from SAR307bn (US$81.8bn;
12.7% of GDP) in 2015. Increased military and security projects in 2015 saw an
additional overspend of SAR20bn last year. It is unclear to us if all of the regional
military costs have been recognised on-balance sheet. A negotiated settlement to the
Yemen conflict through the ongoing political negotiations in Kuwait could help contain
security spending near-term.

Privatization comes back to the government’s agenda
The consideration of a privatization program is not surprising at the current juncture, in
our view. Recall that the Saudi privatization program was initially started in 1999 with
the creation of the now-dissolved Supreme Economic Council, following the drop in oil
prices in 1998. Small-scale privatizations took place in the early 2000s, and 2002 saw
large privatization in the telecommunication sector and postal services.
Selling public sector stakes is one of the non-debt creating financing options for the
government that would help minimize the direct drain on Fx reserves, encourage private
sector development and improve services delivery. That being said, given the lack of
non-oil taxation, this would only contribute to one-off financing flows alongside savings
from a drop in budgetary allocations to the privatized entities, in our view.
The 2015 budgetary appropriations for public institutions totalled SAR163.7bn
(US$43.7bn; 19.0% of total budgeted spending and 6.8% of GDP). We calculate that the
public institutions related to the entities that appear to have been slated for
privatization according to press reports account for budgetary appropriations of
SAR124.8bn (US$33.3bn; 5.2% of GDP. This is likely to be the upper bound of fiscal
savings possible under the privatization program. In our view, this is unlikely to be
realized fully as it includes a large number of universities and because most timelines
appear to center around 2020.

Sales of PIF assets could help replenish fiscal reserves but not Fx reserves
Secondary sales of domestic assets could be a faster way than Initial Public Offerings
(IPOs) and privatizations for the Ministry of Finance (MoF) to raise its fiscal reserves at
SAMA, in our view. We look at this possibility to assess the potential for the MoF to use
it as an option to support its fiscal reserves at SAMA and prevent a debt build-up in
response to ongoing fiscal deficits.
If this were to take place, this could occur through holdings of the PIF rather than the
pension funds who are large institutional investors in the domestic equity market, in our
view. We calculate that the PIF could sell stakes worth around SAR200bn (US$53.6bn)
domestically through liquidating existing minority stakes and selling down majority
holdings while retaining control. If the PIF holdings are above 50%, we assume
arbitrarily that the holding is strategic, and thus calculate the current value of the stake
that the PIF (using the current stock price in the market) can sell down so it retains a
controlling 51% ownership share. If the PIF holdings are below 50%, we arbitrarily
assume that the holding is not strategic, and thus calculate the current value of the
stake that the PIF holds (using the current stock price in the market) as we assume it
could be fully liquidated.
The proceeds of sales domestically (without foreign participation) would increase
central government deposits at SAMA, decrease other domestic liabilities of SAMA but
keep Fx reserves unchanged. Because of the latter, because such large coordinated sales
could weigh on the market and as the PIF is targeted to become the largest SWF by
Saudi authorities, we doubt this is going to be a course policy-makers are likely to be
considering in the near term.

Material fiscal consolidation would be necessary to narrow macro imbalances
There is no substitute for fiscal consolidation to maintain Fx policy unchanged. We map
out below paths for several macro variables depending on fiscal policy and oil prices,
with higher oil prices easing the adjustment requirement.
In a worst case scenario where US$25/bbl oil prices would persist for the next five
years, sustainability of the Saudi Fx policy rests on material fiscal consolidation, which
we believe is achievable based on the mix of revenue-raising and spending restraint
plans likely or announced to date. This would require a total 5-year cumulative
adjustment of SAR500bn (US$133bn; 20% of 2015 GDP or 4ppt of GDP annually) from
2016 onwards, which is close to what the NTP appears to be targeting in non-oil
revenue measures (US$100bn, excluding NTP costs). We think 75% of the adjustment
can take place through revenue-raising measures. The remainder of the adjustment
would need to take place through capex cuts and is similar in size to the capex
retrenchment of the 1980-90s. However, note that if one assumes that the 2015 budget
deficit will be revised higher to 18.9% of GDP, this adds a need for a further 4ppt of
GDP cumulative fiscal adjustment to maintain the same trajectory of Fx reserves.
An overhaul of fiscal policy will likely be required
In line with the 2016 budget announcement, we would expect tight budgets to be
passed. We expect a VAT with 5% yield to be implemented in 2018, alongside further
administered price adjustments for energy, water and electricity. Implementation of the
land tax is likely, but it is unclear whether the proceeds will be ring-fenced to be used
solely for housing projects. Using solely the recurring existing proceeds of the
December administered price adjustments and a VAT introduction, we still see a need
for further fiscal restraint in the order of 1ppt of non-oil GDP annually. The latter would
GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 25
be equivalent to a SAR100bn cumulative spending cut, which we believe can be
accommodated from capex retrenchment. On the basis of the above, fiscal consolidation
would likely drive real GDP growth lower to an average of just around 1% of GDP. This
estimate is based on a ST GCC fiscal multiplier of 0.2 for real spending to real non-oil
GDP, in line with academic literature.
Fx policy stays the course; NTP blurs medium-term incentives
We do not believe Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is considering Fx reform
in the near-term. We have expressed here our view that the Fx peg would hold as fiscal
policy undergoes a sizeable multi-year adjustment. In a bearish scenario for oil prices,
the NTP is unlikely to be implemented as deep budget cuts are likely to be required to
sustain the Fx policy. We believe an oil price of at least US$50/bbl is broadly consistent
with full and timely NTP implementation, but fiscal policy still needs to be disciplined. If
fiscal non-oil revenue targets are missed, a higher oil price is likely to be needed.
However, if the NTP is successful in diversifying the economy, it will make the costs of
running an overvalued exchange rate more prohibitive, particularly as the external
accounts are likely to become more responsive to an Fx shock. It also introduces a progrowth
bias for policy-makers in charge of diversifying the economy, which may conflict
with the implementation of unpopular fiscal reforms or the depth of fiscal consolidation
needed at weak levels of oil prices. The NTP diversification initiatives may suffer from a
timing mismatch when it comes to net external receipts generated. This is because the
sectors that would generate Fx receipts (non-oil exports, religious tourism) or
localization policies are likely to be slow to ramp-up, while Fx demand in the economy is
likely to be supported (rather than deflated) by government diversification policies. Last,
the desire to build a large SWF may suggest a desire to conserve Fx reserves.

Consumer to face mixed trends
Labour policies are likely to remain a major focus for the Saudi government. Low oil
prices have dented the government’s direct ability to support the consumer compared
to the boom years. Furthermore, negative to flat public sector wage growth is likely to
dampen income and consumption trends, although Specialized Credit Institutions (SCIs)
could alleviate tightening banking sector household lending standards.
The NPT suggests a focus on boosting female employment as well as increasing the
cost of foreign labor relative to national labor. The latter implies a negative impact on
corporate margins and profits, in the event higher labor costs are not reflected in higher
consumer prices and inflation). The negative near-term cost and efficiency implications
of continued labour market reforms are mitigated by the fact that eventual increase in
private sector employment of higher-paid Saudi labour should prove supportive for
consumption trends once the dust settles.
The NTP targets increasing the cost of employment of Saudis compared to expatriates
from 400 to 280. We calculate that the ratio of private sector wages of Saudis
compared to non-Saudis stood at 3.64 and 1.29 for males and females respectively in
2015. The NTP target is thus akin to increasing non-Saudi private sector wages by 43%
over the period to 2020, a CAGR increase of 7.4%. This would squeeze corporate profits,
lead to inflationary pressures in the economy, and lead to annual additional Fx outflows
through remittances of US$2.8bn (0.4% of GDP). As such, it is more likely that the
employment cost of non-Saudis is likely to be increased through measures such as fees
for government services, taxes and levies. It is unclear that the NTP target can be met
solely through this route, but it would avoid additional Fx outflows despite still having a
negative impact on corporate margins and inflation, in our view.
The Nitaqat Saudization program is likely to be extended in the near-future through the
forthcoming launch of the “balanced Nitaqat” initiative. While employment quotas are
likely to be tightened, they will also take into account wage levels, job quality and
women employment ratios, according to local press. A likely target is likely to be
increased job creation for Saudis in the retail sector through higher quotas, in our view.

Banks and contractors will require supportive policies to realize NTP benefits
The banking sector is targeted to benefit from the NTP initiatives through greater
disintermediation (SMEs, real estate financing, non-oil export financing) and greater
household savings. However, domestic liquidity is likely to remain structurally tight, in
our view. The NTP targeted increase in non-oil fiscal revenue is likely to tighten
domestic liquidity, all else being equal, as it would have the effect of extracting
resources from the non-hydrocarbon private sector (as opposed to government
domestic spending that injects liquidity).
Linked to liquidity trends and banking sector asset quality, the issue of government
arrears to contractors is likely to take centre stage, in our view. Resolving this is likely to
be required if the capex projects under the NTP are to be executed on a timely fashion,
in our view. We think the government’s proposal to issue I Owe You' notes (IOUs) could
be a step in this direction.
Government looks to issue IOUs
According to the press, the Saudi government has paid contractors some cash on its
arrears, and is considering to issue I Owe You' notes (IOUs) to them. Contractors would
receive these notes to cover their outstanding dues, which they could hold until maturity
or sell on to banks. The government has been highlighting it wanted to settle the
contractor sector dues, and recently a high-profile domestic contractor has made mass
redundancies. In the previous downturn in the 1980s, arrears to domestic contractors
were also likely to have been accumulated. We highlighted that the fiscal deficit was
likely under-reported last year. Also, construction was one of the fastest growing sector
last year both in terms of domestic activity and of domestic credit.
28 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016
Government arrears to contractors could be significant
We estimate the range of unpaid capex for 2015 to be SAR23bn-SAR100bn (US$6bn-
US$27bn or 1-4.3% of 2015 GDP). At the very minimum, unpaid capex could be around
SAR23bn. This is the amount of additional loans taken out by construction contractors
over 2015 compared to 2014. Total construction loans were SAR106bn in 2015 versus
SAR83bn in 2014. Contractors likely did not go to obtain alternative bank funding for
the same amount as the delayed payments from the government, suggesting delayed
payments should be larger than SAR23bn, in our view.
By the same token, the 2015 budget outturns imply capex was down by 45% to
SAR205bn versus 2014 levels of SAR370bn. This is of course unlikely as construction
grew by 5% in real terms in 2015. Correcting the 2015 budget by the likely
underreporting (an additional SAR100bn in spending, assuming it was all capex-related),
then capex spending was likely down by SAR65bn (17%) in 2015. This would be in line
with the c15%yoy drop in construction awards as reported by MEED.
In comparison, government overdues in the healthcare sector are much smaller. Based
on the disclosures of two listed healthcare groups, we estimate the growth of
government receivables owed to them alone is SAR0.4bn. We estimate the total sector
government overdues to private healthcare operators could be 2-3 times this level.
IOUs to serve multiple purposes
IOUs could support simultaneously the multiple needs of the government, domestic
banks and contractors, in our view. The government will be able to conserve fiscal
reserves and restructure the maturity of its outstanding dues. Domestic banks would
substitute corporate credit risk with sovereign risk and improve asset quality, while
contractors could improve their liquidity and working capital position by cashing in early
on the IOUs. We believe most of the contractors impacted could be domestic ones, and
we presume these IOCs would be issued in domestic currency. Furthermore, to the
extent these IOUs are structured as tradable instruments, this could better distribute
risk in the financial sector to those agents more capable or willing to hold it.
Domestic liquidity could be eased, but Fx outflows may not subside
The impact of IOUs on domestic liquidity will likely depend on the issuance mechanism,
of which we have little visibility for now, though this could likely ease domestic liquidity.
We would however expect subsequent Fx reserves losses due to an increase in demand
for Fx consequent to the liquidity injections (a 50% leakage would for instance lead to
US$13.5bn loss in Fx reserves at the high-end of the estimated arrears range).
One possibility for the mechanism would be for banks to extend more secured credit to
contractors using the IOUs as collateral. In this case, domestic liquidity is likely to
remain tight as the banking sector balance sheet would stay stretched. Another, perhaps
more likely, option would be for banks to accept IOUs as deposits. Contractors would
then be able to transfer IOUs to their trade creditors and withdraw cash regularly, with
the total amount being likely a portion of the face value of the IOUs. Banks would hold
new government instruments on the asset side of their balance sheet. This mechanism
could also be structured as a simple sale of the IOUs to domestic banks (with a haircut),
which domestic banks would accommodate through equivalent changes on the asset
side of their balance sheet, without the creation of additional liabilities.
In the latter option, to avoid straining the banking sector liquidity, the deposits
withdrawal or in effect the increased money in circulation would likely require monetary
accommodation from SAMA, in our view. We believe this could take the form of liquidity
injection, possibly through repo operations for the IOUs. Although unconventional, this
GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 29
possible source of easing of domestic liquidity would still be consistent with Article 6
Saudi Arabia’s Currency Law which imposes a 100% currency backing by Fx reserves,
such that that currency issued cannot exceed foreign reserve assets. The full cover
requirement would still be in force as reserve money currently represents just 14% of
foreign reserve assets, down from c100% throughout the period 1996-2000.

Lessons in diversification
There are only few examples of countries that successfully managed diversification
away from primary dependence. The examples of Malaysia and Norway suggest that a
sound institutional framework, robust fiscal framework, supportive public sector
industrial policies, appropriate business climate and human capital are important factors
in enabling successful diversification away from the oil sector. A backdrop of low oil
prices exacerbates diversification challenges but also provides impetus for change.
Saudi comprehensive reforms follow standard template to shift gears
The Saudi NTP broadly follows the generally accepted template of comprehensive
macro- and micro- reforms needed to diversify beyond the hydrocarbon sector, in our
view. The literature suggests successful diversification entails ideally a combination of
three types of innovations: processes, products and organizations. Enhancement in
processes would enhance productivity, new products would support emergence of new
sectoral growth drivers, and improved micro- and macro-governance would help sustain
production gains. The key to furthering the development path would be to move from an
initial labour- and capital-intensive phase towards a phase focused on increasing
productivity growth through higher value-added sectors.
This will require the retention of white-collar workers, steady progress on institutionbuilding,
an increase non-hydrocarbon FDI, horizontal and vertical integration, a broader
manufacturing base including at first through sectors with competitive advantage
(downstream or energy-intensive ones), greater integration into the global value chain
through enhanced trade relations, as well as education and business climate reform to
overcome structural rigidities, in our view.
Medium-term diversification may require Fx reform
As diversification progresses, the case for increased Fx flexibility and making space for
autonomous monetary policy conduct is likely to gradually take shape. Presumably, such
a move would require putting in place a supportive institutional structure which is
currently broadly lacking. It would also await improvements in productivity growth and
the development of competitive local industries to minimize a potential Dutch disease
effect on infant or other sectors. A fairly valued real effective exchange rate (REER)
would support efficient allocation of production factors across sectors and improve
competitiveness of the tradable goods sector.
Malaysia case study highlights the role of supportive public sector
Malaysia’s diversification away from primary commodities relied on a series of National
Industrial Policies and Industrial Master Plans to promote the manufacturing sector.
Focus was given to sectors with high export potential, and efforts were taken to create
linkages with other sectors and to deepen interconnection with other industries. Growth
strategies also aimed to develop local technological capabilities and clusters of
industrial development, similar to the localization and industrial strategies spearheaded
by the Saudi National Transformation Plan.

Norway case study suggests institutions are paramount
While it is perilous to extend lessons that could overemphasize idiosyncracies, the case
of Norway highlights, if anything, the importance of sound institutions and macro
management when it comes to broader economic diversification. The case of Norway
has relevance for the Gulf Cooperation Council countries (GCC), including Saudi Arabia,
especially since oil discovery (late 1960s) and oil production (1970s) timelines were not
that sensibly different from the GCC.
That being said, outcomes were widely different as well as the starting point since
Norway was already a developed country with mature social, economic and political
institutions at the time of the discovery of oil. This allowed a distinction between the
management and ownership of natural resources uncommon in the GCC and several
other resource-based economies, in our view.
Four ways in which the supply-side matters for economic diversification
We believe that there are four lessons to learn from Norway’s outperformance:
1) The importance of human capital
Norway’s priorities from early on were to build human capacity, investing in education,
increasing labor force participation and supporting productivity growth.
2) Prudent conduct of fiscal policy
Current Norwegian oil revenue management puts considerable emphasis on stabilizing
the economy and facilitating a gradual phase-in of oil revenues over time (which crowds
out trophy projects and put onus on achieving productivity gains in the non-oil sector).
Following the 1970-80s boom-bust sequence and expansion of the welfare state,
Norway established in 1991 a Government Petroleum Fund to receive and invest oil
revenue (it received its first net transfer in 1996). The fiscal rule adopted in 2001
targets a central government structural non-oil budget deficit equal to 4% of GPF assets
(the latter assumed to be its estimated long-run real rate of return). That being said,
Saudi Arabia’s infrastructure requirements could have prevented adapting this part of
Norway’s model for long, in our view.
3) Institutional experience
Norway’s development has been characterized by continuous development and
integration of resource-based export-oriented industries, some of which were active
since 1950. While Norway is the world’s third largest exporter of natural gas and the
sixth largest of crude oil, it is also the second largest exporter of seafood, possesses the
fourth largest shipping fleet, is the sixth largest exporter of aluminium and the first
exporter of sub-sea technology products and services.
32 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016
4) Industrial policy
Norway’s active use and introduction of a national industrial strategy has helped shelter
infant industries and create linkages between the natural resource-based industries and
other sectors of the economy. For two decades (1972-1994), preference was given in a
transparent fashion to local content in procurement to help build supply industries, and
provisions were set in for international firms to train nationals, use domestic service
industries and cooperate in R&D with local institutions. Though Norway pre-dates the
GCC in this development, the region shares in many ways some of these policies,
leading to the emergence of national champions. The main difference appears to relate
to the scope, extent and degree of innovation involved in offshoot industries at this
stage, in our view.

Eurobond premium required for fiscal slippage risk
We expect large and regular sovereign eurobond issuance going forward to support FX
reserves and domestic liquidity but weigh on regional bond spreads if risk appetite does
not hold up or fiscal slips. EMBIG index inclusion is unlikely, in our view. Saudi Arabia
CDS premium to Qatar and likely larger issuance size suggests Saudi External Debt
(EXD) is likely to be issued at a premium to Qatar.
Saudi Arabia international bond issuance latest in wave of Gulf supply
Local press suggests that Saudi Arabia is gearing up for a large international bond
issuance program (US$10-15bn issuance target this year), which, if confirmed (the
government neither confirmed nor denied , should add to the sizeable sovereign bond
supply pipeline this year. So far, we have seen US$17.1bn in gross and net supply from
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Assuming Saudi Arabia issues US$15bn
and accounting for planned issuance from Dubai and Bahrain and excluding Kuwait, the
rest of this year should see a further US$16.5bn in gross issuance and US$16.1bn in net
issuance. This would bring the total gross and net GCC sovereign bond issuance to
US$33.6bn and US$33.2bn this year respectively.
Seminal potential bond issuance has multi-pronged implications
If confirmed, this could be a seminal event and mark the first time for the Saudi
government to issue external bonds. It would allow for participation of foreign investors
as domestic debt is being sold to Saudi banks and funds. External issuance should
diversify funding sources, lock in still low interest rates, support SAMA's Fx reserves and
support domestic liquidity; the latter two macro variables have weakened this year.
External issuance would also imply the presence of an underlying asset that could
theoretically trigger CDS contracts, as opposed to the current situation.
Investment grade status to be retained despite likely further rating cuts
A prolonged oil price downturn is likely to continue to put downward pressure on Saudi
Arabia’s credit rating in the medium-term. On average, the GCC has benefited from
three notch rating upgrades over the period 2002-10 prior to the start of the Arab
Spring. Saudi Arabia was upgraded six times, from Baa3 to Aa3, by Moody's over the
period starting from 1999, while it was upgraded two and three notches by S&P and
Fitch over the period starting from 2003/2004 respectively. Moody’s has thus in the
past preserved Saudi Arabia’s investment grade rating at the bottom of the cycle, as
government debt to GDP stood at 103% of GDP and SAMA’s foreign assets at US$17bn
(10% of GDP) in 1999.
EMBIG Index inclusion is unlikely
EMBIG index inclusion is unlikely, in our view. Estimated 2013 (US$25,140) and threeyear
rolling GNI per capita (US$23,090) data likely suggests Saudi Arabia does not meet
EMBIG income index inclusion criteria, in our view. Saudi Arabia would however likely be
eligible for Barclays EM Hard Currency Aggregate Index, based on its IMF classification
as a non-advanced country (noting that the index provider has moved away from solely
using rating for EM country classification). This suggests that Saudi policy-makers need
to articulate a comprehensive, timely and credible medium-term fiscal policy to
facilitate wide take-up from domestic, regional and international investors, in our view.
Pricing matters
Saudi Arabia CDS premium to Qatar, relative credit metrics and likely larger planned
issuance size suggests Saudi EXD is likely to be issued at a premium to Qatar, in our
view. The closest regional peers to Saudi Arabia (A1/A-/AA-) are likely Qatar (Aa2/AA/AA)
and Abu Dhabi (Aa2/AA/AA). Qatar’s existing external debt curve makes it a potentially
34 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016
useful and relevant pricing benchmark in this regard, in our view. The Qatar 10-year
sovereign bond currently trades at yields of 3.0%. However, Saudi CDS has been trading
c65bps wider of Qatari CDS, which would suggest a 10-year Saudi bond yield of c3.65%.
Current CDS spread levels suggest potential for some notch downgrades from Saudi
Arabia’s current rating, as the market prices in issuance risk, volatile oil prices, hedging
flows relative to the USD peg and the banking sector off-balance sheet wrong-way
exposure risk.
Saudi forwards, rates and CDS remain under pressure
Domestic rates are under pressure with the 5y IRS spread over US at historically
elevated levels due to structurally tighter liquidity. Budget consolidation could help take
some of the pressure off as it would imply lower debt issuance needs. However, it would
also imply lower deposit formation in domestic banks as fiscal retrenchment will impact
private sector economic activity. Greater risk premium, issuance pressures and tighter
liquidity will also keep CDS spreads elevated until oil recovers.
Hedging against SAR devaluation risks remains strategically attractive given the riskreward
ratio. Data suggest a strained backdrop for external and domestic liquidity
reflecting the combination of private sector dollarization, possible capital outflows,
weakening deposit formation and the move higher in interbank rates. However, SAMA
has already intervened through macro-prudential tools and may do so again if needed.

Commodities: NTP adds to medium-term oil
market tightness
Francisco Blanch

francisco.blanch@baml.com
Peter Helles
MLI (UK)
peter.helles@baml.com
The Saudi National Transformation Plan (NTP) suggestion that production capacity is to
be maintained at the current level until 2020 reinforces our conviction of medium-term
oil market tightness. We continue to see a call on OPEC of 4.1mn bpd in the next five
years to “balance the market”, and see oil prices of US$55-75/bbl over 2016-2020.
Although the NTP incorporates a target of boosting domestic gas production by 50% to
18 bcf/d by 2020 which could crowd out oil demand, we expect Saudi Arabia’s ability to
switch to reduce oil burn in power generation to 2020 to be quite limited, in our view.
We see oil averaging US$55-75/bbl over 2016-2020
Real Brent prices are at one of the lowest levels in decades, and will likely encourage
very strong demand growth ahead, while we see supply falling across non-cartelized
producers. As such, we see global light sweet crude oil averaging US$55 to US$75/bbl
over the 2016-2020 period, depending on how much incremental production OPEC can
and will supply over the next five years. We think it likely that Saudi will dig into its
untested spare capacity to go for increased market share, though uncertainty over how
much Saudi can and will produce remains. We also remain concerned about output
sustainability among weaker cartel members given the rapid credit profile deterioration.

Non-OPEC production will not reach 2015 levels before 2020 at the earliest…
Non-OPEC producers have massively reduced capex spending, down US$290bn or 42%
from 2014 to 2016, in response to the low price environment. Should capex start to
increase again in 2017, the effect on non-OPEC non-shale production is unlikely to be
felt before 2020 at the earliest. Most of the decline in the short term comes from nonconventional
output in the US, as shale is very price sensitive within a 12-month
horizon. With Brent prices set to increase from US$46/bbl this year to US$80/bbl in
2020 in our base case, we believe US shale production will grow again, albeit at a slower
rate than in the past four years. Total non-OPEC supply is set to drop to 56.4mn bpd in
2017 before rebounding to 57.5 mn bpd in 2020, a similar level as in 2015.

4.1mn bpd needs to be added by OPEC by 2020, namely Saudi, Iran and Iraq
The US is the only country able to ramp up production among non-cartelized players by
2020, so OPEC has to come to the rescue to provide the required incremental supplies.
We estimated that demand will grow by 5.9mn bpd in 2015-20. With the market
oversupply of 1.8mn bpd in 2015, OPEC needs to increase production by 4.1mn bpd in
the next five years to “balance the market”. Saudi Arabia could make up for half of this
given its c2mn bpd of spare capacity, and we believe it intends to at least increase its
market share. We would expect other OPEC countries to expand their capacity in the

next five years, namely Iran and the UAE. As for Libya, the current turmoil needs to
come to an end, while the scale of any Iraqi long-term output increase remains the
biggest uncertainty.

Saudi plans to keep capacity flat add to medium term tightness
Saudi Arabia has 12.5mn bpd of crude production capacity, according to the
government, and the country suggested within the NTP that it plans to maintain
capacity at the current level to 2020. Saudi Arabia is the only material holder of spare
crude oil production capacity around the world. Spare capacity currently sits at c2mn
bpd, which is one of the lowest levels ever. Even if Saudi Arabia did start investing
today, it would take a number of years to be completed and would unlikely be ready
before 2020 in any case. Hence, as Saudi ramps up production over the medium-term by
digging into its spare capacity, the risk premium in the oil market will rise as the market
becomes increasingly less able to handle future supply disruptions.

If Saudi gas production gets off the ground, it could crowd out oil demand…
The Saudi NTP plans to grow domestic gas production by 50% to 18 bcf/d by 2020, and
to use most of this gas to meet a 30% rise in domestic power demand and moreover
boost gas’ share in power generation to 70%, up from 50% currently. This implies that
oil burned for power generation could drop by 30% or 300 thousand bpd by 2020, most
of which would likely be crude which is more valuable in the export market than the
38 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016
residual fuel oil burned. Saudi Arabia has the world’s 4 th largest gas reserves, yet
reaching the 5.8 bcf/d production growth target by 2020 is not that straight forward.
…though boosting gas production to the NTP target poses significant challenges
The new Wasit project, which is due to come online in 2016 and ramp up to 2.5 bcf/d by
2020, meets about 40% of the gas production growth target. Other than that, Saudi
Arabia is focusing on getting unconventional production off the ground to meet the
remaining 3.3 bcf/d of the production growth target. The timing, cost and commercial
feasibly of which this unconventional gas is highly uncertain. The 2.5 bcf/d from the
Wasit project is about the amount of gas that would be needed to meet incremental
power demand and displace 300 thousand bpd of crude burn, assuming gas demand
does not grow in other sectors, which is unlikely. Hence, it is likely that Saudi’s ability to
switch significantly to reduce oil burn in power generation to 2020 will be quite limited,
explaining the new openness to consider gas imports, in our view.

Equity Strategy: more clarity required, but
investible themes emerging

More clarity required, but high level benefits becoming evident
The recent National Transformation Program (NTP) document provided a much awaited
articulated roadmap through 2020 of how the government is seeking to achieve its
highly ambitious Vision. However, we believe significantly more detail is still required
before the market can make more concrete conclusions on the key winners and losers
from the program as well as quantify the impact it could have on corporate earnings
(both positive and negative).
Whilst at this juncture it is difficult to quantify the size of the NTP opportunity for
individual companies, we feel more confident in highlighting the sectors that we see
could benefit from Saudi Arabia ambitious plans. We have detailed the sectors that we
see as likely benefiting most in the table below. We also highlight the sectors which
could face the most negative impact from the roll out of the NTP.
GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 39
Table 13: Summary of key sectors likely benefiting from and impacted by the National Transformation Program
Sectors likely benefiting from NTP
Petrochemicals
Healthcare
Insurance (healthcare)
Real estate
Consumer staples
Telecom
Metals and mining
Defence
Rationale
With US$ 11bn being allocated to project development, downstream chemicals second largest focus of NTP; significant increase
in natural gas availability (indigenous and imported); expansion opportunities
Volume growth opportunities for private healthcare providers (management contracts); private health insurance growing;
participation in privatisations; significant increase in local pharmaceutical production
Private insurance coverage to increase to 31mn from 10.5mn currently; rising availability of private healthcare facilities
Higher home ownership targeted; improved access to financing/housing subsidies to both developers and buyers; volumes set to
expand as NTP targets higher real estate sector growth; increased opportunities for private sector investment
Demand growth from religious tourists; formalisation and Saudisation of retail sector; growth in locally produced poultry sales;
longer-term private sector job creation
Government spending US$2bn to enhance FTTH and Mobile networks; focus on increasing internet usage; religious tourism will
boost demand
Provision of new mining licenses; potential investment opportunities for international mining companies
Increased localization will cut imports, develop local industrial capabilities and create jobs
Sectors likely negatively impacted by NTP Rationale
Consumer discretionary Near-term squeeze on consumer disposable income and sentiment; increased competition as foreign entities given 100%
ownership entitlement; development of Saudi postal system possibly a precursor to online shopping increase
Petrochemicals
Potential reduction in feedstock subsidies; potential for increased competition from international companies
Real estate
Land tax on white land could impact cost base and prices in urban areas; higher competition from new entrants

Six key investible themes from the NTP are emerging
Using this frame work we believe a number of investible themes are emerging including:
Rising costs on reduced subsidies (particularly water and energy); higher wage costs; increased financing burden on private
sector as government partially shoulders NTP costs
1. Ambitious plans to grow religious tourism: with Hajj visitors set to increase
from 1.5mn to 2.5mn and Foreign Umrah Pilgrims from 6mn to 15mn per
annum, we see significant potential for the travel & tourism, transport sectors,
consumer discretionary and telecom services sectors to benefit.
2. Down trading as pressure mounts on the consumer: With the NTP looking
to reduce subsidies on energy (including transport fuels) and water, we see
pressure on the disposable income of Saudi consumers rising in the short- to
medium-term (although in the longer term, we expect higher employment
levels, growing home ownership and accelerating growth to offset these
factors). These issues could be further augmented by a slowdown in public
sector wage growth and growth in the proportion of residents employed by the
private sector,
In reflection, we believe that the consumer will likely become more value
conscious in the near- to medium-term as stress on consumer discretionary
spend mounts. As such, we continue to prefer the consumer staples and the
grocery retailers in this environment. We also believe the grocery retailers will
benefit from the government’s focus on formalising the sector (it is highly
fragmented currently and dominated by smaller independent stores) in an
effort to increase Saudi participation. That said, we believe consumer
discretionary companies which offer more affordable and economic goods
could benefit as they take market share.
3. Rising focus on healthcare provision: Saudi Arabia is focused on significantly
growing accessibility to healthcare for its residents. The provisions in the NTP
include a significant increase in medical centres (hospitals and clinics), wider
provision of private health insurance and an increase in the level of
40 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016
pharmaceuticals manufactured locally. We thus see potentially strong
opportunities for the private hospital operators, the health insurance providers
and local pharmaceutical manufacturers.
4. An improvement in the availability of affordable housing for Saudi
nationals: The Saudi housing shortage has been a persistent issue for the
country; with the shortfall currently standing at an estimated 1.2mn units, in
our view. Looking forward, we believe this shortfall will likely intensify given
strong demand formation. The NTP is seeking to introduce greater numbers of
affordable housing units and greater availability of financing. Indeed, the
ministry of housing is looking to invest cUS$16bn in achieving these aims by
2020. Whilst we do not believe these measures go far enough to fully resolve
the housing shortage, we nevertheless see material opportunities for Saudi real
estate developers.
5. Growth in telecom/fibre infrastructure: The NTP is seeking to greatly
enhance connectivity in the country, largely through increased usage of
internet. Reflecting that, the government has pledged approximately US$2bnn
to significantly increase the availability of high speed FTTH networks in remote
areas, increase mobile broadband coverage and density in urban centres
(3G/4G) and allocate an increased amount of bandwidth to the mobile service
providers. We thus see significant volume growth potential for the telecom
service providers (particularly with regards to mobile data, where we see scope
for price increases). Furthermore, we expect much of the capital expenditure
required to expand the FTTH and Mobile networks to be provided by the
private sector, which in our view will accelerate the case to spin off their tower
portfolios (as a method of funding capex expansions).
6. Significant growth in downstream petrochemicals capacity and metals &
mining: The NTP’s drive to diversify revenues away from the oil sector has
seen it focusing on exports of non-oil commodities. In particular, we highlight
the significant investment it has earmarked for the downstream industries
including petrochemicals and oil refining, as well as aggressively growing the
country’s metal and mining operations (likely through national champion,
Maaden). Examples include the expansion of the country’s base metals
production (e.g. bauxite and phosphates) and the construction of an oils-toolefins
project. The further development of capital intensive industries also
provides some scope for Saudi Arabia to develop service industries and
increase local content provisions, in our view. These could be facilitated
through joint-ventures with global service providers, who may consider
manufacturing plants in Saudi Arabia.

Saudi market valuation not testing
The Saudi market has been one of the poorest performing emerging markets year-todate,
underperforming the MSCI EM indices by approximately 10% (and c20% since
August 2015). A combination of weak oil prices and their inevitable impact on the Saudi
economy including slowing economic growth, rising operational risks and fiscal
consolidation (including subsidy removals) have been the key drivers. The
underperformance has left the market trading on a 12mth P/E of c.13x, an 11% discount
to its long term average and its lowest premium to GEMs since 2010 (Saudi trades on a
7% percent premium vs long run average of c. 30%). Furthermore, Saudi trades on
12mth FWD P/B ratio of 1.5x, a 20% discount to long run averages, but a 15% premium
to GEMs on 1.3x, justified by the market’s higher ROE’s (Saudi’s long term P/B premium
has been c.25%). Finally, Saudi trades on 12mth FWD EV/EBITDA multiples of 9x, a
c.11% discount to long run averages.

Weaker economic outlook largely priced in as ERR shows inflection
A further consequence of the weakening economic outlook for Saudi Arabia has been
the collapse in market expectations, with earnings estimates having posted their longest
sustained period of downgrades on record. We note however, the Saudi Earnings
Revision Ratio (ERR) has reached an inflection point, with a slowdown in the rate of
earnings downgrades. (ERR is a ratio of number of companies enjoying earnings
upgrades vs number of companies suffering downgrades. A ratio above one, therefore,
indicates more upgrades than downgrades). Consequently, we believe the relatively untesting
valuations of the Saudi market indicate that a high level of negativity is already
being priced in.

Off benchmark and out of mind? Growing confidence could drive rerating
With Saudi Arabia remaining off benchmark (it is not currently part of any major indices
such as the MSCI EM or FM), GEM funds allocation to Saudi Arabia remains relatively
low at just 0.25% (of total GEMs AUM). Whilst allocation levels are relatively high versus
history, they are still significantly below the levels implied by MSCI EM inclusion (1.4%)
or suggesting a level of apathy towards the market.

assuming that this market was a member of MSCI EM index
With the NTP looking to diversify the Saudi economy away from the oil sector (and
reduce its reliance on a higher oil prices), we believe confidence in the longer term
economic outlook could improve, ultimately driving earnings momentum and a market
rerating. Given our view that crude oil prices will likely post growing momentum in 2017,
moving substantially above US$50/bbl, even a partial success of the NTP program would
likely be sufficient to improve market confidence.
CMA reforms (likely linked to the NTP), a potential catalyst for market rerating
Furthermore, reforms being introduced by the Saudi Capital Markets Authority (CMA) to
attract greater foreign participation in the Saudi market (see below) indicate Saudi is
44 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016
seeking an expedited path to inclusion within the major Stock indices. Given the NTP is
seeking heavy involvement/investment from the private sector, we believe the measures
introduced by the CMA to attract direct capital inflows to the country are likely linked
with the larger NTP process. Growing confidence in the CMA’s market reforms and the
potential for inclusion in the major indices could prove to be a meaningful basis for the
market to rerate upwards.
Taking positive steps to accelerate MSCI inclusion
The Saudi Capital Markets Authority recently announced extensive changes to the
Qualified Financial Investor (QFI) program, which should ultimately increase the ease of
foreign access to the Saudi market. In particular:
(1) Individual foreign investors will now be allowed to own up to 10% of the equity in a
company (up from 5%). The total limit on foreign ownership remains at 49%.
(2) CMA decreased the minimum AUM of QFIs to US$1bn from US$5bn (although funds
with AUM’s below this level will be considered by the CMA).
(3) CMA introduced stock lending & covered short selling;
(4) CMA extended the settlement cycle to T+2 from T+0, effectively eliminating prefunding;
(5) CMA effectively removed the concept of a QFI client, which would have prevented
investors from using multiple fund managers to gain exposure to Saudi Arabia. This
highly restrictive clause was a significant reason why many global institutions did not
seek to gain QFI status; and
(6) CMA significantly reduced the amount of bureaucracy required to apply for and
retain QFI status.
MSCI inclusion one step closer as accessibility increases
In our view, the range of measures the CMA is looking to adopt greatly enhances the
accessibility of the Saudi Stock exchange and as such bring Saudi Arabia one step closer
to inclusion in the MSCI EM index. Whilst we continue to see inclusion most likely from
2019 (with an announcement in 2018), the new changes indicate that a 2018 inclusion
(with an announcement in 2017) is by no means out of the question. Indeed, whilst the
timing of introduction of these new measures is likely to be 1H2017, a recent release of
the draft proposals from the CMA suggested it could come as soon as 3Q16; although
we await further clarification.
A higher weighting in international indices
Saudi Arabia is currently under consideration for inclusion in the MSCI EM index,
potentially as soon as May/June 2018; although we believe 2019 is more likely. Saudi
Arabia is currently not included in any of the Major global indices and as such its
inclusion would have a profound effect on the market as it:
(1) leads to significant inflows of capital in to the market from both active and passive
funds following the MSCI EM index and;
(2) significantly increases interest in the Saudi market as it gains profile and is no longer
seen as off benchmark.
We see these factors as compatible with the NTP aim to boost capital markets.
Currently Saudi would be 1.4% of MSCI EM = US$10.9bn of inflows.
As per MSCI’s guidance, we use MSCI’s standalone Saudi market index as a template
(released May 12th 2015) for Saudi stocks to be included in the MSCI EM index. The
MSCI Saudi index currently contains 19 stocks (all listed entities on the Tadawul market)
which are likely for inclusion in the MSCI EM index (were Saudi to be included). By
taking the total market cap of these companies and multiplying them by the foreign
GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 45
inclusion limit articulated by the MSCI (currently 0.2), we are able to decipher the
relative weighting of Saudi Arabia if it were to be included the MSCI EM index.
This analysis suggests that Saudi’s potential weighting in the MSCI EM Index (were it to
be included today) would be c1.4%. Furthermore, it would likely trigger net inflows (from
other MSCI EM markets) of US$10.9bn when including all passive and benchmarkneutral
active funds tracking MSCI EM. Importantly, our analysis is based on EPFR data,
which respectively indicates US$405bn and US$354bn of active and passive funds
following the MSCI EM index.

Privatisations & ownership limits could increase weighting
However, our analysis of Saudi Arabia’s weighting could be significantly understated for
two reasons, including: (1) our analysis currently uses a foreign ownership limit (FOL) of
0.2 (as previously guided by the MSCI). This could be understating Saudi’s weighting
given the increase in foreign ownership introduced in the CMA’s announcement. Indeed,
if we increased our FOL factor to 0.4, Saudi would be 2.8% of the MSCI and could
attract US$21.3.bn of inflows; and, (2) Saudi Arabia (according to local press and the
NTP) is seeking a number of privatisations in the coming 24 months, including a
potential IPO of Aramco. Inclusions of these companies would likely increase Saudi’s
weighting in the MSCI EM index and thus attract higher inflows to the market.
Inclusion of energy assets could see Saudi accounting for 4.1% of MSCI EM
By way of example, we believe inclusion of Saudi Aramco in the Saudi market would
profoundly affect the weighting of Saudi Arabia in the MSCI EM in our view. Indeed, if
we were to replicate the analysis above using the Deputy Crown Prince hypothetical
valuation of US$2tn for Saudi Aramco and a 5% inclusion factor (given 5% or less of
Saudi Aramco would be listed according to interviews with the Deputy Crown Prince),
Saudi Arabia would account for 4.1% of the MSCI EM index and likely attract cUS$31bn
of inflows from passive and active funds. We note, our calculations are highly sensitive
to the inclusion factor that MSCI would ultimately use (we assume 5%, in line with its
estimated free float of 5%). An inclusion factor of 10% for example, would see Saudi
Arabia accounting for 6.6% of the MSCI EM index.

NTP helps increase penetration of higher margin offerings
We believe the National Transformation Plan will herald significant change for the Saudi
telecom sector over the next five years. In particular, its focus on increasing access to
high speed internet (via wireless and fibre) should underpin a material uplift in data
usage and broadband penetration levels. Given these offerings represent the highest
margin services provided by the telecom service providers, we believe the move towards
a more data intensive society should be supportive for industry margins. Furthermore,
with the NTP’s plans relying heavily on private sector investment (including STC), we
believe it could accelerate the spin out of tower portfolios from the three telecom
players in the Kingdom (as a way of raising financing).
Government investment set to exceed US$2bn
As part of the National transformation plan, the government is seeking to invest more
than US$2bn in the expansion of wireless (3G & 4G) and fibre infrastructure (FTTH)
across the kingdom. Whilst the finer details on how this expenditure will be deployed
(e.g. via grants or via direct investments?) have yet to be disclosed, details of the NTP
suggest it will be used to expand connectivity in the remote areas of Saudi Arabia (given
the telecom companies have largely avoided such expenditure in the past given low
returns), as well as increasing network density in developed and urban areas.
Spectrum increases an indication of ambitious growth
The government is also looking to significantly enhance the availability of spectrum to
the telecom industry (from 42% to 80% of total spectrum allocated), highlighting the
expected surge in data usage in the Kingdom to 2020 and beyond. Whilst data usage in
the Kingdom has been rapidly growing in recent years on the back of high speed rollouts
(3G & LTE), demand still lags global and regional averages (as indicated by data as a
percentage of total mobile revenues). Ultimately, we believe this will have a number of
effects including: (1) Saudi Arabia will further increase its focus on high speed offerings,
(LTE/LTEA and eventually 5G); (2) capex cycles will likely lengthen as telecom companies
intensify their rollout of coverage; and, (3) tower density will likely have to increase
across the key demand centres.

Private sector participation and investment will be crucial…
Whilst the government has earmarked cUS$2bn for the expansion of FTTH and wireless
infrastructure (with a view to ultimately increasing internet usage), we believe this will
likely be insufficient to meet the needs of the NTP’s ambitious targets (based on costs
of rolling out existing wireless and FTTH networks). As such, we believe the private
sector (Zain KSA, Mobily and STC) will be key contributors to the financing of the
expansion plan.
…intensifying the case for creation of a Saudi tower company
The Saudi telecom service providers have invested heavily in rolling out high speed
wireless networks and, in the case of Mobily and STC, FTTH networks (not to mention
license costs). This has seen the balance sheets of both Mobily and Zain KSA reaching
relatively high gearing levels; thereby limiting their ability to step up capital expenditure
for a sustained period. Consequently, we believe the focus on raising capital (to fund the
expansion programmes) from the spin out of their Tower portfolios will only increase.
We see Zain KSA as the key beneficiary of this given they have the most highly geared
balance sheet amongst Saudi Telco peers.
Mobile market share gains for Zain KSA and Mobily increasingly important
Whilst the Saudi government has taken steps to introduce competition in the
telecommunications industry, its moves to open the market have thus fallen short of
this objective. Specifically, government-owned STC retains more than 60% revenue
market share in Saudi Arabia, giving it a dominant position in the market, whilst Mobily
and Zain KSA have only managed to achieve c25% and 15% revenue market share
respectively.
This, in our view, has likely been driven by a number of factors including: (1) the
relatively high cost of market entry (ie licenses) for both Mobily and Zain KSA, which has
lumbered both with high operating costs; (2) high royalty costs, which amount to c16%
of revenues generated in Saudi Arabia (with some exceptions, including data), arguably
inhibiting requisite marketing and infrastructure spend. We note both Mobily and Zain
KSA remain loss making; and, (3) the relatively high mobile termination rates, which
arguably afford an advantage to STC and prevent Zain or Mobily from competing more
aggressively on price.
For the realisation of the NTP, we believe it is important that all private sector players
are realising sufficient rates of return and FCF generation to be able to finance the
requisite growth in infrastructure. We note both Mobily and Zain KSA were loss making
in 2015 and are expected to return sub 5% ROE’s in both 2016 and 2017 (according to
GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 49
Bloomberg consensus estimates) vs. STC at 17% (consensus). It is thus arguably crucial
for Zain and Mobily to be allowed to increase market share in the mobile arena. We thus
believe the regulator (CITC) regulator will have to consider further steps to afford
market share to the second and third entrants including asymmetric competition
measures (pricing, MTRs), license extensions or differentiated royalty rates.
STC the likely beneficiary of FTTH expansion
Whilst we argue that STC could lose further market share in the Mobile market as a
result of regulatory moves, we believe the negative impact will be offset by growing
revenues from FTTH, IPTV and the corporate market. Indeed, we believe STC, given its
market leading FTTH network and IPTV offering, will likely benefit most acutely from
the growth in the number of FTTH customers. Furthermore, with government grants
likely to be provided for FTTH roll out in less economical areas (as part of the NTP), we
believe returns will likely not suffer from the additional capital deployment. Mobily could
also benefit (given its well-developed FTTH infrastructure), although we expect it to lag
STC who has a first mover advantage and arguably a stronger FTTH/Triple play offering.
We note, Zain KSA will unlikely participate in the rollout of the FTTH expansion given its
constrained balance sheet and strategic focus on the wireless market. That said, the
company could benefit from the rollout of high speed internet solutions over its wireless
network (ie fixed broadband over its 4G network), particularly in areas where the
construction of FTTH networks maybe be difficult or uneconomical.
Royalty rate increases unlikely, particularly for Zain KSA and Mobily
Admittedly, an increase in royalties could be an easy way of raising much needed
revenues for the government. After all, each 1% increase could raise income by more
approximately SAR500mn (cUS$130mn). However, we would argue that this is unlikely
given the lack of sufficient competition in the market and the obstacles to increased
competition higher royalty rates would introduce. In the same vein, we also believe it
highly unlikely that the government would seek to introduce a fourth mobile operator
license given the lack of sufficient market capacity between the second and third
operators.
Religious tourism a material opportunity for telecom providers
Saudi Arabia’s ambitious growth targets for religious tourism provide a material
opportunity for the telecom providers in our view. More specifically, if the number of
religious tourists (for Hajj and Umrah) increases by an estimated 10mn per annum by
2020, we believe demand for roaming services (voice and data) and sim purchases will
increase significantly. Indeed, on our estimates, we see the 10mn visitors potentially
providing a SAR2bn-SAR4bn opportunity, representing a c4-8% uplift in total wireless
revenues for service providers. We particularly believe Zain KSA will benefit strongly
from this given they provide the most competitive Pay as you go packages currently and
have the largest spare capacity on their network.

Health: Not Tremendously Prescriptive
Vision 2030 a start but Needs Transparent Proposals
The Saudi government’s Vision 2030 document calls for an improvement in healthcare
in Saudi Arabia. The private healthcare sector has some role to play; the National
Transformation Plan (NTP) targets the private sector to be responsible for funding 35%
of healthcare spend in 2020, up from 25% today. How it intends to do this is uncertain.
We believe the incumbent private hospital operators, including listed companies (Al
Hammadi, Care, Dallah, MEAHCO and Mouwasat) should be beneficiaries of increased
private sector funding, although increased investment would be needed to meet growth
in demand longer-term.
Improve public facilities, work towards privatisation
The government wants to step back from financing and providing healthcare and adopt
an oversight and regulatory role. Firstly the government wants to improve the quality of
care offered in the public sector, with the eventual aim of working towards privatisation
of public assets and healthcare provision. This implies no privatisations short-term.
Near-term: Management contracts for public hospitals
In the near-term the government could seek to improve healthcare provision in the
public system by using private sector expertise, through, e.g. contracting management
of public facilities to the private sector. Individual such contracts are unlikely to
transform company earnings, and the small size of existing Saudi hospital groups limits
the depth of management available to capture large contracts, in our view.
Long-term: insurance coverage up to 31m from 10.5m
In the long-term a widespread adoption of private health insurance is likely to raise
volumes, spurring an increase in private healthcare capacity, either from organic
investment or participation in privatisations. In Saudi currently, 10.5m/31m people have
insurance. We assume a more universal scheme would offer lower pricing than that
today, and listed incumbents would need to make a cultural shift towards addressing
this market. Such a market could attract new competitors, domestic or foreign.
Type of insurance system and reimbursement uncertain
We believe reimbursement levels would need to be known before privatisations can
occur so bidders can budget and estimate their return on capital. It is still uncertain
whether the government would seek to introduce insurance through the incumbent
private operators (Bupa Arabia, Medgulf and Tawuniya) or set up its own insurance
company e.g. an Abu Dhabi-style Daman. Nor whether it would subsidise premiums or
simply force the private sector to employ more Saudis.
Government needs to improve private sector relations
At present the government has not paid private hospitals for the treatment of public
patients referred to them for over a year. Until the relationship improves, engaging with
the private sector could be difficult.
Healthcare implications of National Transformation Plan
The Saudi government’s Vision 2030 document calls for an improvement in healthcare
in Saudi Arabia. The private healthcare sector is likely to be a beneficiary both in the
short-term and long-term. In the short-term the National Transformation Plan (NTP)
targets the private sector to be responsible for funding 35% of healthcare spend in
2020, up from 25% today. In the longer-term, the Saudi government wants to remove
itself from directly providing and financing healthcare, instead focussing on public
health and the regulation of the healthcare sector. Raising private sector funding
thresholds to 35% appears possible if a number of measures are used, e.g. more
rigorous enforcement of requirement that Saudis working in private sector hold
insurance could increase penetration by 6% alone. The quality targets set for the public
sector do not appear unduly onerous in theory, but execution remains key.

Government currently payor and provider
The government currently directly funds public hospitals, which provide free healthcare
for citizens. The typical flaw with a unified system is that increased efficiency is not
necessarily sought or rewarded. Employer-provided healthcare insurance is mandatory
for both Saudis and expats working in the private sector, as well as their dependents.
Significant scope for increase in insurance coverage from 10.5m to 31m people
Saudi currently has a population of 31m, of which 10.5m have health insurance, a 34%
penetration rate. Bupa Arabia believes another 2.5m Saudis who work in the private
sector (including dependents) don’t have health insurance but should have. Assuming the
government increases enforcement, near-term penetration could increase to 42% of the
population even with extra reforms.
Strain in relations between government/private sector
The government has not paid private providers who have treated government patients
for a year, which is hardly going to encourage the private sector's further involvement,
particularly those companies that have seen the biggest increase in their receivables (Al
Hammadi and Dallah). However, the government can still put considerable pressure to
bear on the sector to achieve its aims if it so wishes.
Increased Saudisation could be used as a policy
The easiest way for the government to increase private financing of healthcare to 35%
from 25% would be to raise Saudisation requirements. Under Saudisation, the
government sets a minimum proportion of a company’s staff that must be Saudi
citizens, which differs by industry sector. Increased Saudi employment in the private
sector short-term would put the onus of financing healthcare onto employers. However,
such a move would likely pressure private sector margins.
Increase pressure on employers to trade down on insurance
The impact of Saudisation as a mechanism would likely be negative for pricing although
positive for volumes, assuming the hospital has the capacity to accept more patients.
Employers would likely seek to trade down in terms of the insurance schemes they offer
in a bid to reduce their involuntarily raised expenditure. Insurers would seek better deals
with hospitals as a result and could seek restricted network arrangements to curtail
GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 53
costs. Hospitals would be under pressure to be more flexible on prices to avoid any
pressure should lower-cost packages impact their volumes.
Vision implies a long process
To us, the government's vision implies a two stage process over a long time-frame:
• In the short-term: improve the quality of care offered in the public sector,
potentially with the assistance of private healthcare
• In the long-term: Only when public facilities have improved, privatise such facilities
(although one medical city is to be privatised under a public-private partnership)
• Concurrently: Prepare for a roll-out of private health insurance to finance private
provision
Abu Dhabi and Dubai are probably not parallels
In Abu Dhabi and Dubai, private healthcare was encouraged to avoid expats relying on
public facilities. The large expat population in proportion to the locals (85:15) supported
the creation of private facilities that it was then possible for the governments to fully
fund Emiratis to use. The quality of public facilities was not a cause for concern - many
Emiratis still prefer to use government facilities for more serious problems.
Expat population and quality of public system differ in Saudi
The proportion of expats (33% of the population) is not large enough to drive the
establishment of a large, high quality private hospital base sufficient to serve the entire
Saudi population. Additionally, the quality of both care and infrastructure in the public
system is seen as lacking, suggesting additional investment in facilities is required.
Degree to which private sector will benefit is uncertain
Given the lack of detail provided to date, it is hard to assess the benefits, or risks to the
incumbent private hospital operators in detail. We see two main ways the private sector
can participate in healthcare reform:
• Win contracts to run and improve public health facilities
• Benefit from volume growth any roll-out of private health insurance could spur
• Participate in privatisations
In the long-term, volumes up but pricing down, likely to benefit nonetheless
At present there is limited supply of quality private hospitals and the incumbents are in
a strong bargaining position with insurers. Greater private hospital supply, and
competition, would likely pressure pricing, and margins in the longer-term, albeit offset
by increased volumes. Assuming only basic services are offered to most citizens under
any government-driven scheme, there would still be a place for offering higher-quality
accommodation for example, to higher-income patients.
Private sector could win public hospital contracts
Private operators could be allocated management contracts for public hospitals to
improve efficiency of existing hospitals, train public sector administrators and raise
clinical standards. Presumably reimbursement under such contracts would be based on a
fixed fee, potentially with performance clauses for improved outcomes or lowering
costs. More substantive contracts, where the private operator is responsible for all
aspects of operating the hospital could be more accretive, but bring greater financial
risk.
54 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016
Table 17: Examples of management contracts
Company Contracts
Dallah Dallah has had two types of hospital contracts.
One, which just involves management expertise, was worth SAR4.5m over five years and 10% of the
hospitals income.
The other was worth SAR89m over five years but in this Dallah was responsible for all staffing and
supplies and infrastructure operation and maintenance.
Mouwasat Mouwasat managed Najd consulting hospital in Riyadh in return for management fees of c.SAR3m per
year; this was subsequently changed to receiving a share of revenues and net profits.
NMC
NMC was awarded a contract to manage a government hospital in Umm Al Quwain, UAE. The five year
contract sees it earn $5m (SAR18m) in fees per year, subject to certain performance criteria being met.
During the term of the contract NMC is to train government staff to which it will hand over administration
at expiration.
Source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, company report
Private groups may lack capacity to undertake such contracts
The private hospital groups in Saudi Arabia are small. Habib Medical Group, Mouwasat
and Middle Eastern Healthcare group are the largest, with only 8, 5 and 4 hospitals
respectively. We would question whether any company has the depth of management to
undertake management of a large number of government hospitals. Potentially the
government could seek to import foreign expertise.
Insurance roll-out likely to boost private volumes
Longer-term, the roll-out of private insurance would likely have a positive impact on
volumes available for incumbent operators to capture. This will depend though on the
available capacity of private operators at that time and level at which reimbursement is
set. The current listed operators typically target high income patients and a lot of the
growth in volumes would likely be in the low-to-middle income spectrum.
Cultural shift would be needed to target larger population at lower price point
It would require a clear cultural shift for the incumbent listed hospital operators to
switch from offering a high quality service to high income individuals to operating
facilities that served the wider population at what we presume would be a much lower
price point.
Investment is difficult until pricing and reimbursement is clarified
Until reimbursement levels are clarified, existing private operators/investors will not be
able to make decisions on investing in private healthcare facilities.
Privatisations seem unlikely in the near-term
Given the stated intention to improve the quality of hospitals prior to privatisations, it
seems unlikely there will be any near-term, although the NTP does call for privatisation
of one of the medical cities in a public-private partnership. Saudi operates a number of
medical cities, which are typically collections of hospitals that act as tertiary referral
centres. The largest of these is the King Fahad medical city in Riyadh, with 1,095 beds.
It is uncertain which city is planned for privatisation. As with further investment by
private operators in new facilities, the level of reimbursement would need to be clarified
so potential bidders can estimate their return on investment from participating.
270 public hospitals in Saudi currently
Latest available data (2014) from the Saudi Ministry of Health discloses 270 public
hospitals with 40,300 beds. Of these, 47 hospitals are in Riyadh, with 25% of the
population, and 13 hospitals are in Jeddah, which holds 14% of the population.
Presumably these assets would be the most valuable during a privatisation process, not
only because of the population sizes, but also because the provision of beds hasn’t kept
up with population growth, ensuring high demand. Both areas also host the highest
number of private hospitals in the country.

Hospital quality would be key to attracting private buyers
The government has not invested in hospital infrastructure and some hospitals may
require substantial investment by any buyer, if they are acquired at all. One Saudi
hospital operator has said that there is no way it would seek to acquire government
hospitals for that reason.
Bidders would likely want to obtain scale benefits from multiple purchases
Operating hospitals has benefits of scale in terms of centralising certain non-medical
services (e.g. purchasing, catering, laundering) and allocating central costs over a greater
revenue base. The greatest financial benefit would come from acquiring groups of
hospitals to maximise these benefits. There would likely be cases where staff, and/or
high net worth individuals chose to bid for individual assets.
Privatisation proceeds could defray some of NTP cost
Amounts raised from any privatisation would reflect the degree of competition for
individual assets as well as level of reimbursement and the profits any acquirer could
generate. In terms of pure asset values we assume the Riyadh and Jeddah hospitals (60)
would be worth more than those elsewhere (210), simply because of the greater
population currently and higher expected future growth. Government hospitals are likely
lower cost than that of private facilities given they are not competing on the quality of
accommodation offered. Arbitrarily assuming US$100m for hospitals in Jeddah and
Riyadh and US$50m elsewhere would imply proceeds of $16.5bn (SAR61bn). If every
hospital were sold then it could more than cover the SAR23bn allocated to the MoH for
the NTP. That seems unlikely however; there will be hospitals that require substantial
investment and aren’t worth the indicative figures we have used above, or are in areas
where profitability means there will be no return for the private sector at that level of
acquisition.
Reforms could attract additional competition
Incumbent private hospital operators are best placed to expand and are seen as the
natural buyers of any privatised assets. However, any substantial privatisation process,
or the potential created by widespread adoption of private health insurance in general,
could attract interest from foreign investors or operators. We note only a small number
of international hospital groups to date have experience of successfully operating in
multiple countries (IHH, Mediclinic), and we think Saudi Arabia could be too challenging
as a first step for those yet to operate outside their domestic market.
Structure of insurance market needs to be set
There are a number of ways the government could roll-out private health insurance
more widely:
• Set up its own insurance company
56 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016
• Work with existing private insurers
• Use a back-door approach and just force private employers to hire more Saudis
The government could set up a state insurance company
The government could set up a single-state insurer that is either funded through direct
contributions or through general taxation. The government would likely need to get
external help from a party knowledgeable in insurance and risk, which could be an
insurer, Saudi or otherwise. Daman, Abu Dhabi's health insurer is owned 80% by its
government and 20% by German insurance company Munich Re.
Existing private insurers may not have capacity if they were made responsible
The government could decide to execute any financing scheme through existing private
insurers, or give citizens the option of choosing either a government or private insurer.
The existing private healthcare insurers in Saudi Arabia are unlikely to have the
resources (both people and systems) in place to provide cover for an additional 20m
people immediately and will need some time to prepare. Any large scale immediate
expansion could put them at risk of substantial underwriting losses that they would
presumably seek to have back-stopped by the government in the initial stages.

Consumer: a necessary pain
Abdelrali El Jattari >>
Merrill Lynch (DIFC)
abdelrali.eljattari@baml.com
The Saudi government initiatives taken in the National Transformation Plan (NTP) will
transform the Saudi consumer landscape. We note a mixed effect on the sector:
• On the positive side, we anticipate 1) job creation for Saudi nationals in the private
sector with a big focus on Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs); 2) a strong
emphasis on education; 3) an ongoing increase of the participation of women in the
workforce; 4) an increase of the percentage of self-sufficiency in broiler production
which should ultimately support local producers; and, 5) a significant pick-up of the
religious tourism during Haj and Umrah.
• On the negative side, we anticipate 1) a rationalization of subsidies for water and
electricity; and, 2) a more competitive retail environment, more open to
international players, attracting foreign direct investment (FDI).
Prefer staples over discretionary
While slowing consumer credit and weaker private sector consumption growth amid a
young population do not support Saudi spending in both staple and discretionary items,
we expect staple-related stocks such as Al Othaim and Savola to be better positioned to
capture the marginal consumption. This is principally due to their exposure to
necessities (food items) in a very fragmented market. Having said that, we expect more
pressure on the opex of all Saudi consumer corporates, while revenue growth outlook
will remain subdued in the short-term given the weaker consumer confidence and
disposable income.
A more moderate growth outlook; Saudi female workforce drives private sector
Following a 12% 10-year CAGR fuelled by the rise in household income, we conclude
that the retail sector will continue to play an important role in the rising participation of
the Saudi workforce, women in particular (10,000 in 2010 vs 120,000 in 2014 according
to the Ministry of Labor) supporting their disposable income in the long-term. Overall,
the Saudi retail sector is one of the largest employers in Saudi Arabia with 1.5mn
workers (17% of the Saudi workforce) of which low-cost foreign workers represent 80%.
This implies that Saudis working in the retail account for 300,000 (40% are female),
doubling in 4 years.
Needed reforms: better macro at the expense of micro
While we acknowledge that the targets set by the government are paving the way for
the right reforms (development of the private sectors, a more competitive economic
landscape, attraction of FDI), we expect the Saudi retail outlook to be marked by a
slower growth in the coming years. In particular, we highlight few major challenges for
the effective implementation of the plan: 1) incentives to enrol Saudis into consumerrelated
jobs suggesting rising opex pressure for consumer stocks; and, 2) 20% public
payroll cut will put pressure on Saudi disposable income in the short-term given than
c80% of the Saudi workforce is in the public sector.
Key strategic objectives and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to watch
The National Transformation Plan (NTP) outlays several strategic objectives and related
KPIs to watch by ministry which we believe will impact the Saudi consumer universe:
• The Ministry of Economy and Planning is looking to 1) expand privatization of
governmental services; 2) increase the efficiency of government subsidy programs;
3) establish specific zones with competitive advantages to enhance investments;
58 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016
and, 4) develop tourism and entertainment sector. To do so, the ministry mainly
targets to decrease the subsidy for water and electricity by SAR200bn by 2020 and
to expand the private sector contribution to GDP from 40.5%.
• The Ministry of Commerce and Investment is looking to 1) reinforce the protection
of the Saudi consumers; and, 2) develop SMEs by incentivizing the culture of
entrepreneurship and supporting productive families. The ministry targets by 2020
to 1) more than double the number of established entities from 50k to 104k; and, 2)
increase the contribution of SME to non-oil GDP from 33% to 35%.
• The Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture is looking to 1) optimize the
use of renewable water resources for agricultural purposes; and, 2) support national
companies. The ministry targets by 2020 1) to consume more than twice less water
in the agricultural sector, which should be reflected in a lower percentage of water
used in the agricultural sector relative to the total available renewable water
resources (191% vs 416% today); and, 2) to reinforce the Saudi independence to
the broiler production by increasing the percentage of self-sufficiency in broiler
production to 60% from 42%.
• The Ministry of Haj and Umrah is looking to provide the opportunity for the largest
number of Muslims possible to perform Haj and Umrah. The Ministry targets by
2020 the number of Haj pilgrims to increase from 1.5mn to 2.5mn and the number
of Umrah Pilgrims from abroad to increase from 6mn to 15mn.
• The Ministry of Labor and Social Development is looking to 1) improve education
and enable more Saudi nationals to enter the job market; and, 2) to increase the
participation of women in the workforce. The ministry targets by 2020 to 1) create
1.2mn jobs in the private sector (men and women); 2) reduce the unemployment
rate to 9% from 11.6%; 3) reduce the cost of employment of Saudis compared to
expatriates to 280% from 400% today, which implies a higher cost of expatriates;
and, 3) to increase the proportion of female force to 28% vs 23% today.

Rationalization of subsidies for water and electricity
The sweeping energy, water and electricity administered price changes introduced in
December 2015 are a first step in the five-year fiscal consolidation and economic
transformation strategy. We expect further reviews of energy, water, and electricity
prices over the medium-term. Furthermore, the likely government review of current
levels of fees and fines, introduction of new fees, application of a VAT and introduction
of excise taxes on tobacco and soft drinks will also impact the Saudi consumer.
Subsidy cuts on energy and utilities to add up to 1.5ppt to CPI inflation only
We estimate the December natural gas price hike on petrochemical firms, domestic
crude oil price hike as well as the combined gasoline and diesel price hike introduced
could add US$2.2bn, US$2.0bn and US$3.8bn to central government revenues if fully
passed to the budget (a combined 1.2% of GDP). We estimate the direct impact of these
higher gasoline, water and electricity prices to add 1.3-1.5ppt to CPI inflation due to
their low basket weights (c.1.5%, c0.4% and 1.6% respectively). We think a 5% VAT tax
could add c2% of 2015 GDP in fiscal revenues over the medium-term.

Subsidies account for 15% of Almarai’s net income; 40% are related to poultry
Almarai continues to receive subsidies from the Saudi government, amounting to
SAR295mn in 2015. This represents 15% of the Almarai’s 2015 net income. The
government pays subsidies based on price of subsidized feed importer, which means it
may increase or decrease naturally. Regarding the breakdown by business (poultry,
dairy), it is unfixed, depending on the price of feed and ingredients. As of 2015,
subsidies for poultry accounted for 40% and dairy for 60%.
60 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016
Saudi Arabia approves 100% foreign ownership rules
• Saudi Arabia’s cabinet has approved rules governing foreign ownership of retail and
wholesale businesses in the Kingdom. The regulations, which were first discussed
last year, allow foreign investors to own 100% of retail and wholesale businesses in
the country. Earlier, the ownership ceiling for foreigners was set at 75%. This
initiative is aimed at attracting more regional and international brands to Saudi
Arabia, creating more jobs, and boosting non-oil revenue. This has raised concerns
regarding the sustainability of the business model of Saudi retailers.
• Real estate is key to entering a market: unlike its peers, Al Hokair enjoys favourable
access to prime locations in well-located shopping malls owned by its parent
shareholder, Al Hokair Group. Fashion retailers such as Inditex continue to compete
for good-quality real estate in shopping centres and on high streets.
• Jarir and Extra are more vulnerable to the entry of international retailers such as
Apple as barriers of entry are very low for consumer electronics and appliances.
Furthermore, the government emphasis on developing tourism and family
entertainments (Six Flags, Sea World) represents a potential threat to Jarir and
Extra’s business models which still play an ‘entertaining’ role in Saudi Arabia.
• Such initiatives would result in (1) reducing the number of stores; (2) a rapid
modernization of the sector; and, (3) a significant increase in labor productivity by
adopting merchandising best practices.
Rationale for liberalization
The rationale for permitting FDI in retail trading is (1) attracting investments in
production and marketing; (2) improving the availability of such goods for the consumer;
(3) encouraging increased sourcing of goods from Saudi Arabia; and, (4) enhancing
competitiveness of Saudi enterprises through access to global designs, technologies and
management practices.
Typically, global retailers follow a 100%-ownership business model, which explains their
reluctance to establish their presence in Saudi Arabia because of the restrictive policy
environment. This has been reflected in the little amount of FDI received in the Saudi
retail sector.
However, we do not believe that such decision will provide foreign investors more ability
to have control of a company as the current ownership ceiling of 75% already allows
them to pass both ordinary and special resolutions.
Key opportunities of 100% foreign ownership initiative:
We perceive several opportunities emerging from such an initiative:
1) Capital infusion: FDI is one of the major sources of investments for a
developing country like Saudi Arabia wherein it expects investments from
multinational companies to improve economic activity, create jobs, share their
expertise, back-end infrastructure and research and development in the host
country.
2) Boost competition and dampen inflation: the entry of the many multinational
corporations will promise intense competition between the different
companies offering their brands in a particular product market. This will result
in availability of many varieties, reduced prices, and convenient distribution of
the marketing offers.
3) Improvement of supply chain: Improvement of supply chain/distribution
efficiencies, coupled with capacity building and introduction of modern
technology will help arrest wastages, particularly in the food supply chain.
GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 61
4) Jobs creation: the entry of foreign companies into retailing in Saudi Arabia will
not only create job opportunities but will also ensure quality in them, improving
standards of living and life styles.
Al Hokair: Eased restrictions on foreign investors: perception vs reality
The liberalization of the Saudi retail industry raised concerns among Al Hokair investors
regarding the potential loss of the Inditex franchise, which we estimate accounts for 8%
of its total stores. We think this risk is overstated for the following reasons:
• Relationship with parent: Unlike its peers, Al Hokair enjoys favourable access to
prime locations in well-located shopping malls owned by its parent shareholder, Al
Hokair Group. The group owns and operates 13 shopping malls across Saudi Arabia
(1.2m sqm of prime real estate) through its subsidiary Arabian Centres Company.
However, we understand that rents are currently negotiated on commercial terms,
thereby limiting the risk of a conflict of interest. We do not think the situation will
change.
• Real estate is key to entering the market: Fashion retailers continue to compete
for good-quality real estate in shopping centres and on high streets. Going forward,
there is likely to be significant competition between these companies for new sites,
especially in prime shopping centres, as they all require similar locations, typically
prominent, wide-fronted premises. Zara, in particular, uses its shop windows to
advertise its products.
• Local manufacturing and distribution network would add execution risks and
costs to international retailers such as Inditex: While Saudi Arabia has not yet
provided the details and conditions of the potential eased restrictions on foreign
investors, we understand that the government is looking to attract investments,
diversify its economy and improve Saudization. This means foreign retailers could
be asked to set up local manufacturing and distribution networks within Saudi
Arabia, which we believe could discourage retailers such as Inditex from entering
the market directly.
More malls, less bargaining power with international retailers
The accelerating pace of mall developments in Saudi Arabia by regional competitors to
Al Hokair’s parent company suggests a rising risk of diminishing bargaining power for Al
Hokair with its international brand partners such as Inditex. We expect Shumoul Holding
55% owned by Mabanee, the Kuwaiti mall operator, to develop a 400k sqm mall in
Riyadh while Dubai-based Majid Al Futtaim recently announced that it is looking to
develop two malls in Riyadh of 300k and 100k sqm of GLA respectively resulting in four
times more stores (300) in the next five years. Such new entrants can then
accommodate foreign retailers (such as Inditex), which could question the sustainability
of Al Hokair’s franchise model.
Jarir: exposed to NTP innovations
What if Apple enters Saudi Arabia
Should Apple enter Saudi Arabia, it would negatively impact the Apple resellers such as
Jarir as the majority of the sales would be transferred to the Apple-branded stores. As
such, we highlight 2 key risks to Jarir that would ultimately deteriorate earnings outlook:
(1) rising competition from Apple resulting in a weaker footfall trend due to weaker
electronic sales, which are key for store traffic; and, (2) intensifying competition from
organised retail space (malls), reducing the market share of specialist retailers such as
Jarir.
Jarir’s earnings sensitive to electronics business
With c40% of revenues and c20% of gross profit derived from the electronics segment,
Jarir remains vulnerable to the threat of foreign retailers entering directly Saudi Arabia.
62 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016
We estimate that a 20% decline in electronic sales would result in a 5% direct decline in
gross profit. However, this ignores the other negative effects of other product
categories due to a weaker footfall trend.
More entertainment in KSA, less attraction for Jarir’s stores
In line with the guidance of the NTP, we expect Saudi Arabia to develop the
entertainment sector (theme parks, cinemas). This signals the emergence of new
aspirations and social changes for Saudis. While these developments will support
implementation of Saudi Vision 2030, they will pose threats to the existing business
models of Saudi retailers such as Jarir and Extra that are currently substituting for the
lack of entertainment opportunities in the country.
GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 63
Real estate: NTP positive but not enough
The Saudi residential sector is suffering an acute housing shortage which we estimate
at c1.2mn homes. Key reasons are:
• 1) Land is expensive: land constitutes as much as 50% of the cost of a housing
unit which is more than double the typical 20-25% in more affordable areas
globally.
• 2) Affordability issue: banks are reluctant to provide mortgages to workers from
the private sector.
• 3) Limited financing: the Real Estate Development Fund (REDF) which used to
provide interest-free loans to eligible Saudis for home purchase or construction, has
been unable to cope with the demand for new loans and has a backlog of about
450,000 applicants. The housing ministry is looking to issue Islamic bonds to help
fund the country’s REDF at the end of 2017.
• 4) Overrun development costs: Long delays for construction approval and permits
translate to overrun costs which create obstacles for developers to launch
economically feasible projects.
A persisting shortage of affordable residential supply
The shortage of housing is not a new phenomenon – it has been ongoing for decades.
The demand outlook from end-users is solid. Domestic household formation (marriages)
is a large component: newly married Saudi couples need an affordable place to live. With
market demand growing by 105K units pa (BofAMLe), we believe the shortage of supply
will persist for the following reasons:
• The limited scalability of residential projects – Dar Al Arkan is the largest
residential developer with only a 1% potential market share (delivery capability of
1,100 units pa).
• The capital-intensive Saudi financing model – without funding support from the
government and a virtually non-existent off-plan sales market, Saudi developers
have to secure funding to undertake larger residential projects. Dar Al Arkan is
having to lever up, as land sales, which were once the primary source of funding,
are no longer enough to enable it to scale up.
• A lack of incentives for large regional developers to enter the market – the
dearth of off-plan sales has dried up the cash flows of developers and limited their
ability to finance new projects and, in the worst cases, ongoing projects.
Furthermore, the profitability of affordable housing projects is not compelling
enough to attract developers to the Kingdom.
Fragmented Saudi residential market
Some 75% of new housing supply is from individuals and micro-home builders. This
trend highlights Saudis’ preference for building their own homes and illustrates the
immature profile of the real estate market in Saudi Arabia. Sovereign actions in
neighbouring countries, like the UAE, have boosted the sector (land granted to
developers, capital flows from international investors). We see big developers becoming
more active in the Kingdom but the effects on supply will not be immediate, in our view.
So far, they represent only 15% of the total market.
Key strategic objectives and KPIs to watch
• The Ministry of Housing is looking to: 1) improve performance of the real estate
sector and increase its contribution to the GDP; and, 2) enable citizens to obtain a
suitable residence. The ministry targets by 2020 to: 1) double the real estate sector
64 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016
contribution to GDP from 5% to 10%; 2) reduce the average time required to
approve and license new residential real estate; 3) reduce the housing unit cost
from 10x to 5x of the gross individual annual income; and, 4) increase the real
estate financing to non-oil GDP ratio from 8% to 15%.
• The Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage is looking to increase and
develop hospitality facilities and tourism services. The ministry targets by 2020 to
increase the number of hotel rooms/apartments by 39% to 621.6k.
Positive government ambitions but…
The rise of real estate finance to non-oil GDP from 8% to 15% implies an incremental
funding of US$32bn which could finance c212k additional units by 2020 or c53k
additional units p.a. This compares to an estimated annual demand of 181k units which
come on the top of the existing c1.2mn shortage of housing.
…needs to be combined with land tax and sukuk issuance initiatives
Based on the target Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) set for the Ministry of Housing,
we estimate the initiative to be supportive but not sufficient to cater to the natural
annual demand which is 3.5 times more elevated than the implied additional supply
funded by the programme. We understand this initiative has to be combined with the
land tax initiative and the potential sukuk issuance from the Ministry of Housing which
could add further liquidity to the REDF to finance more units.
Land tax - gradual revenue source
Land tax among flagship measures adopted by the Saudi government
We expand more below on our understanding of the land tax initiative which was
recently approved by the Cabinet to tackle the housing shortage and raise government
revenues. Saudi Arabia’s Cabinet announced in November 2015 that it will gradually levy
a 2.5% tax on undeveloped land plots owned by persons or private entities in urban
areas, after the country’s Shura council approved a proposal to impose taxes on the socalled
white lands. The draft law was amended to include gradual taxes in accordance
with a specific timetable to force landlords to sell land, thus increasing land supply.
The regulations adopted in mid-June define undeveloped land as all vacant land
dedicated to residential use or commercial residential use within the urban boundary
limits. Fees will be applied to in a gradual series of stages; first, to owners of
undeveloped land with areas exceeding 10,000 square metres; second, to single owners
of developed land of more than 10,000 square metres in one master development plan;
third, to single owners of developed land of more than 5,000 square metres in one
master development plan; and, last, to single owners of land of more than 10,000 square
metres in one city. The Ministry of Housing will determine the land locations where the
tax will apply. The extension of the tax in later phases to developed land, from
undeveloped ones at first, will broaden the tax base and minimize tax evasion.
Tax proceeds will be deposited in SAMA
The taxes and fines collected by the Ministry of Housing shall be deposited in the
central bank, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, and will be used to develop the
country’s infrastructure for new housing projects, according to the state-owned news
agency.
Law could be effective this month, but gradual implementation likely
Under the new system, the housing ministry has been in charge of issuing executive
procedures and rules for the new legislation within 180 days. The law will be effective
180 days after publication in the official gazette. The housing ministry is finalizing
necessary amendments to the decree by end-June 2016 and aim for implementation by
17 January 2017 (including a 1-3 year grace period).
GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 65
Tax on land: a lever to lower real estate prices in urban areas
Given that the government is giving landlords a grace period in order to either develop
or sell land to developers, we perceive the newly approved land tax as a lever to lower
real estate prices. Ultimately, this would improve household affordability, reduce social
tensions and indirectly tackling energy subsidies as it frees up potential household
income to spend on electricity and gasoline.
Land tax could generate up to US$11bn/yr from the major urban cities
We estimate that the government could potentially collect up to US$11bn per annum of
tax related to undeveloped land in the top 5 urban Saudi cities which accommodate
more than 50% of the Saudi population. While the law will not be effective until end-
2016, we do not expect the tax proceeds to be significant early on.

Metals & Mining: ambitious growth target
Faisal AlAzmeh, CFA >>
Merrill Lynch KSA Company
faisal.alazmeh@baml.com
The NTP has focused on several areas relating to domestic drivers, i.e., housing, retail,
trade and finance. However, a core part of the Saudi government’s transformation
strategy is to focus on expanding the Kingdom’s mining potential. Saudi Maaden has
historically been Saudi’s mining champion, but the mining sector currently contributes
only around 2% to the Kingdom’s GDP. The NTP has set a high target for the sector: its
contribution to GDP growing by 50% to SAR97bn by 2020 and sector employment
increasing by 40% to 90k. While the first target could be achieved given the amount of
capital that is currently being deployed in the sector, the latter part is questionable in
our view as capital intensive projects are not the best means for employment
generation.
Government focus on mining to boost jobs and growth
The focus on mining is driven by the ample and growing resources available. The
Kingdom’s largest mined products are phosphates, bauxite and gold. It supplies around
8% of global DAP production and has the largest integrated aluminium company in the
world. Ma’aden continues to discover new gold and copper sites as well. We believe the
outlook for mining is encouraging and the contribution to GDP targeted by the
government could be achieved. We believe investments in this sector faces two hurdles:
1. Diversification – the base metal cycle lags that of oil but is eventually driven by the
same global drivers (global growth). Furthermore, the NTP has currently set a low
number for its capital commitments to the industry (US$82mn), achieving the
targeted diversification and job creation at the moment seems to be highly
dependent on attracting private sector capital. This would require attractive
incentives schemes such as energy subsidies, tax exemptions or ease of issuing
work permits for expats. However, at the moment, these have not been addressed
by the Saudi authorities.
2. High capital intensity – for example, the government has spent close to US$21bn
on Saudi Maaden but the company employs only around 6,000 permanent workers,
of which Saudis account for nearly a third. While the build-up of this capacity does
create a multiplier effect of almost 10x during the construction phase, most of the
added jobs are usually low income blue-collar jobs that tend not to attract Saudis.
Domestic services sectors create more jobs than mining for dollars spent
We argue that capital spent on domestic services sectors is likely to yield more
employment for dollars spent. A key example is Saptco, the Saudi Public transport
Company, which has spent around US$450mn on assets and currently employs around
the same number of permanent employees as Maaden, of which 1,200 are Saudis. We
acknowledge that the technology and technical transfer will be different in an
investment like Maaden versus Saptco, yet we believe the economic efficiency of using
the mining sector as a means of generating employment is questionable.
NTP is already happening: Saudi Aramco has project to create 2,000 jobs
The plan to develop the mining industry is moving forward. Saudi Aramco has already
announced its plans to build a downstream industrial complex along with GE and
Cividale SpA. The complex will include the first-of-its-kind high-end forging & casting
manufacturing facility and will serve the region’s maritime and energy industries. The
project will cost around US$400mn and likely generate around 2,000 jobs.
GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 67
Exports will largely depend on market conditions
Part of the NTP relies on growing Saudi exports, including that of the mining industry.
While it is easy build a plant, the timing of when there projects come online and how it
coincides with the cycle matters. The ability to dump will largely depend on the position
on the cost curve, which seems to be fading with the recent reduction of subsidies.
The conglomerate model to continue
Saudi Arabia has historically adapted the conglomerate model to build up its industrial
sectors, such as petrochemicals (SABIC), metals & mining (Maaden) and steel (Hadeed).
We believe the government continues to focus on this model in its NTP plan and will use
a number of vehicles to expand the sectors in question: Maaden in metals & mining and
the new military company in defence.
Maaden has transformed from a pure gold producer to one of the largest conglomerates
in Saudi Arabia at the moment. Through three key Joint-Ventures (JVs), the company is a
top producer of DAP (Diammonium Phosphate) and gold and aluminium. The NTP clearly
sets the stage for Maaden to grow even further but is unclear on how this is to be
achieved and what it would mean for shareholders. Also, in our view, the all-in-one
model has delivered subpar returns globally and the trend is towards the streamlining of
operations and specialised vehicles. As an example, the largest petrochemical and
agrichem companies, Dow and Dupont, plan to merge and then split into three different
businesses, providing more specialisation. We can see the advantages of the specialised
entity model as it provides cost synergies, efficiency and a clear strategy for the
company. Also, in the conglomerate model, certain parts of the company are often
dwarfed as other revenues streams represent a larger contribution to returns. Board and
management could be more or solely focused on the sub-segment had if it is a standalone
entity they have to monitor and manage, in our view.

Oil & gas/petchems: focus on downstream
Faisal AlAzmeh, CFA >>
Merrill Lynch KSA Company

Focus on downstream expansion is a priority
An increased focus on downstream expansion is a strategic development priority in
Saudi Arabia, with the aim of exploiting competitive advantages on feedstock costs and
the strategic location. Furthermore, the government sees it as a mechanism to create
job opportunities for nationals. We see the NTP natural gas target as optimistic as it
faces many hurdles, while imports could be a better alternative which authorities now
suggest they could be open to eventually.
Downstream chemicals represents the second largest focus of the NTP
The NTP is firmly focused on the integration of chemicals/refining/mining capacity into
value-add downstream operations that would limit imports of certain products and
provide technology transfer into the Kingdom. This accompanies the government’s plans
to expand its natural gas and refining capacity by 48% and 13%, respectively.
The NTP includes a sizeable allocation to the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu,
the government body that overlooks, promotes and develops the
petrochemicals/energy-intensive/mining sectors in the Kingdom. The government plans
to spend around US$10.9bn on developing various areas including: 1) the oil-to-olefins
(OTC) complex in Yanbu; 2) colleges and institutes in Jubal Industrial area; 3) the
necessary infrastructure in the community area of Yanbu Industrial City; and 4) valueadd
transformation industries in Raas AlKhair Industrial City.

Subsidies are likely to be needed
A key obstacle to building more refining capacity and a large OTC complex is the high
capital intensity of such projects and the subsidies required to ensure an acceptable rate
of return. We see the natural gas target as optimistic with many hurdles; importation
could be a better alternative. We believe the government plans to reduce subsidies in
water and electricity, but maintain them for feedstock prices as intensive natural gas
production requires cheap gas to thrive. However, a move towards benchmarking to US
gas prices is a likely and logical step, in our view. An alternative scenario would to mark
natural gas prices in the Kingdom to the LNG netback out of Qatar. This would facilitate
an additional US$2.5bn from the sector but would also put several companies at risk of
becoming loss making (especially companies with a high content of heavy feed in their
input mix). Should such a scenario take place, we believe implementation would be
carried out over phases in order to allow companies to cope with the new pricing order.

Moving further down the value chain
Downstream operations in Saudi have historically been international Joint-Ventures (JVs)
and government-owned entities like SABIC. In July 1993, the government issued a Royal
Decree that merged all the state-owned refineries, distribution activities and marketing
operations under Saudi Aramco.
This resulted in a transfer of the government’s stake in three key refineries and
international refining and petrochemical operations to one state-owned company.
Today, Saudi Aramco is one of the largest crude oil refiners in the world and aims to
become a top-three petrochemical producer through standalone petrochemicals
facilities like Sadara, downstream integration at its many refineries, and potential
acquisitions. The recent announcement of the US split with Shell was followed by
comments that the breakup was due to different strategies by both companies with
Aramco increasing its focus on petrochemicals.
Petrochemicals - a route to diversification
Saudi Arabia is emerging as one of the largest petrochemicals producers globally. The
country initially started with integrated refining leading to petrochemical production
through its multiple JVs in Saudi and other regions, and is now building the largest
petrochemical complex globally. One of the goals is to maximise the value of the Saudi
hydrocarbon chain. Ultimately, this expansion into petrochemicals should further support
the diversification drive and thus support the stated goals for the Saudi economy.
Saudi Arabia (potentially through Saudi Aramco) aims to become a leader not only in
commodity chemicals, but also downstream petrochemical conversion. In the cities of
the Jubail and Rabigh, the Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources (along
with Saudi Aramco) is constructing value-parks next to upstream chemical facilities. The
aim is to provide integration and the infrastructure for SMEs to operate and produce
value-added products in the Kingdom. This diversification into specialty chemicals could
increase returns from the current US$500/ton level to around US$2000/ton by 2040,
according to local press citing senior Aramco officials. Saudi Arabia could also look to
grow its international refining footprint to provide further integration opportunities, as
was suggested by the recent split of the Motiva JV (Saudi is more keen to expand its
downstream operations, whilst Shell is looking to reduce them).
Two petrochemical projects are also being built. The first is the Sadara project in Jubail,
which is expected to become the world’s largest integrated chemicals complex with
3MMt of output. It will use naphtha as feedstock. The second is Petro Rabigh II, which is
the expansion project of the existing Petro Rabigh plant that will process 4MMt (93kb/d)
of naphtha feedstock, and is planned to be launched in 2016.
NTP includes the long discussed Oil-to-Olefins (OTC)
Saudi’s national transformation plan includes the development of a US$770mn
industrial cluster whereby expansion to the Aramco refinery is likely to take place,
providing the platform for the long discussed OTC, Oil-to-Olefins, project. Saudi
70 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016
authorities have highlighted in several press releases that Aramco and SABIC are looking
at potential oil-to-olefins projects. The Kingdom has a proprietary technology that
enables it to maximise the yield of olefins per ton of oil used. According to SABIC's
management, this project has been carried out on a small scale at test sites and it is
conducting feasibility studies at a larger-scale facility. Aramco has also highlighted plans
in this area. While both companies declined to comment, Bloomberg highlighted that
sources indicate they are assessing the possibility of embarking on a project together.
Such a step would be the first of its kind in Saudi Arabia, with Aramco and SABIC
working alongside each other on such a large scale.
Refining capacity target: almost there
The NTP aims to increase the refining capacity to 3.3mn bpd per day by 2020 from
2.9mn bpd today. Saudi has recently completed and launched two large refining projects
with 400kbpd installed refining capacity each: (1) SATORP in Jubail launched in June
2014; and (2) YASREF in Yanbu – first shipment made in January 2015 and inaugurated
in January 2016. In addition, it is building a new refinery, Jazan, which should process
400kb/d of Arabian heavy and medium crude oil; launch is expected in 2019.

Ambitious natural gas expansion
The NTP also focuses on expanding natural gas production. The government aims to
grow the existing production by 48%, largely through non-traditional routes. According
to the minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources, natural gas accounts for 50%
of energy production and the target is to increase this to 70% by 2020 through
expanding local production or importing if necessary. The government’s priority will be
to explore the option of local production, although imports were, for the first time, not
excluded. We consider this as an interesting development as importing LNG into Saudi
costs the same as producing it internally through non-traditional routes, in our view. The
Saudi statement acknowledges that Saudi Arabia is willing to be open to the possibility
should imports provide a more economic means for this purpose.

Utility sector: sharing the capex burden and
achieving cost reflective tariffs
Ali Dhaloomal
MLI (UK)
ali.dhaloomal@baml.com
Eight strategic objectives aimed at being self-funding
The electricity sector is mentioned in eight strategic objectives of the NTP 2020. The
two most important measures in our view are the one related to subsidies cuts and the
one on the liberalisation of the sector which should free out financial resources to fund
the future capex burden as well as the other targets under the NTP. This is even more
relevant as the NTP doesn’t provide any additional funding for the sector.
Unanswered questions as to impact on electricity sector
While we think these initiatives should be welcomed as they would reduce the financial
burden on Saudi Electricity Company (SEC) from its ambitious capacity expansion plan
(SAR240bn / US$64bn to be spent over the 2016-21, mostly in generation), some
questions remain unanswered, especially in regards to SEC’s capital structure and
financial sustainability on a standalone basis. It remains unclear if the proceeds from the
disposals of the minority stakes in the GenCos will be used to fund future capex plans or
to alleviate SEC’s commercial debt (US$16.3bn as of FYE15) and government and
government-related debt and payables (c.US$46bn as of FYE16). Also, it remains unclear
if on the back of the NTP, SEC would start paying its current payables (fuel sourced
from Aramco, electricity sourced from SWCC and fees owed to municipalities) instead of
accruing these amounts as it does now.
1. Saving SAR200bn annually by cutting the water and electricity subsidies: The
current print of the NTP doesn’t give any detail about how this target will be split
between water and electricity subsidies, but we note that the plan aims to reach full
cost reflective water tariffs by 2020 (from 30% cost coverage at the moment).
Recall that starting from January 1st, electricity prices have been increased by a
weighted average of close to 20%, with residential prices (half of the consumption)
now ranging SAR 0.05-0.30 / KWh vs SAR 0.05-0.26 previously. The highest
increases are for the commercial sector, the governmental entities and the
agricultural sector. SEC’s management recently indicated to us that they expect a
neutral impact over the long term from this decision as it mirrors an increase in
feedstock price charged by Aramco. However, over the short to medium term, SEC
cash flows are expected to benefit from the tariff decision given that the company
books all its fuel costs in payables without disbursing any amount to Aramco.
2. Increasing the percentage of power generation through strategic partners to
100% from 27% now: We believe that the aim here is to bring industrial or
financial partners in all SEC’s and Saline Water Conversion Corporation (SWCC)
generation units, in line with the electricity sector reform which expected to be
implemented by late 2016 / early 2017. According to SEC’s management, the most
likely scenario involves SEC’s generation assets to be split into four separate
regional GenCos where minority stakes would be sold to major global utilities or
sold in the public market.
3. Increasing the efficient use of “fuel” in power generation to 40% from 33%
now: We think that this objective entails increasing the share of efficient combined
cycle gas turbines (CCGT) plants. Given that SEC currently represents 73% of the
country’s installed capacity and that 19% of its electricity is generated via efficient
combined cycle gas turbines (CCGT), this means that 71% of the remaining tier
party capacity is “efficient”. We note that another 39% of SEC’s installed
generation capacity is made of less efficient open cycle gas turbines (OCGT).
GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 73
4. Increasing the reserve to peak demand to 12% from 10% now: This reserve
margin was just at 2.3% back in 2012 and SEC was assigned a target of 10% which
management expects to fulfil. In light of the recent improvements and SEC’s
ambitious capacity expansion plan (SAR240bn / (US$64bn in capex over the 2016-
21), the target looks realistic to us.
5. Reducing the outages of more than 5min to 3.0 per year from 6.4 per year now
and the average outage time to 120 minutes from 262 minutes now. This goal
will likely be achieved through the ongoing investments in expanding and improving
SEC’s transmission and distribution network (half of the overall capex incurred in
2015 went to these two segments).
6. Increasing the access to electricity to 99.5% of the population from 99% now:
It is hard to quantify the cost of this objective, but we believe that it entails
increasing the reach to the remote Eastern and Southern regions of the country
where the economics of expanding the transmission network are not relevant.
7. Reach 86 GW of installed capacity vs. 69 GW at the end of 2015 (incl. 50 GW
at SEC alone): The target is in line with SEC own current ambitious expansion plan
(22.8GW to be added over five years to reach 68.3 GW by the end of 2018) and
factors in additional capacity from SWCC and IPPs as well.
8. Generate 4% of the electricity from renewables (equiv. to 3.45 GW): we would
expect the projects to be primarily based on onshore wind and solar. It is likely that
these projects will be fully developed by IPPs under long term power purchase
agreements where SEC would be the offtaker and assume the higher cost of the
electricity from these ReIPP. While SEC has currently no renewable generation
capacity at all, it has recently invited expressions of interest for potential lead
developers for two 50MW solar photovoltaic projects, which we see as a (modest)
step towards the NTP target. Based on the KACARE study on grid impact, Saudi
Arabia’s electricity network should be able to integrate up to 14GW of renewables
capacity by 2020. Finally, we note that ACWA Power, the largest privately-owned
utility company in Saudi Arabia and one of the main IPP players in the country
(along with Engie), has developed a proven expertise in wind and solar projects
internationally. ACWA is likely to be one of the main players in the upcoming
liberalisation plans.

Defence: Vision 2030 supports defence
spending
Celine Fornaro >>
MLI (UK)
celine.fornaro@baml.com
Benjamin Heelan >>
MLI (UK)
benjamin.heelan@baml.com
Saudi Arabia is increasing its regional role as a Security and Defence nation in the
Middle East region. The 2030 Vision includes a higher local content in defence
procurement which can be achieved through new contract awards and increased
cooperation with large Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). BAE is best
positioned, in our view: it has been the in the country since 1966 with 5,000 local
employees and Saudi Arabia represents 21% of BAE’s group sales.
Saudi Arabia to build out military industrial base
Defence is one of the key industries that Saudi is pinpointing for investment as part of
its future strategy plans, and one where it is well placed to become a global leader, in
our view. Saudi Arabia has one of the largest defence budgets globally, and we expect
its focus on defence investment to remain broadly intact regardless of the price of oil.
Due to regional tensions, defence spending will likely remain high for the foreseeable
future, in our view. Saudi Vision 2030 and the associated National Transformation Plan
(NTP) will likely increase focus on use of defence to achieve their economic
diversification goals. This is likely to take place through capability deployment and
employment in partnership with long term defence partners. Saudi authorities aim to
raise the locally-sourced defence procurement from 2% today to 50% in 2030.
Much of the countries’ defence spending is for foreign imports. According to
consultancy IHS, 1 out of every 7 dollars spent on defence imports in 2015 was spent by
Saudi Arabia, which was predicted by IHS to increase its defence imports by 52%yoy to
US$9.8bn in 2015.
In our view, Saudi strategy to increase locally manufactured defence content is justified,
given their level of purchasing power with international contractors. However, this could
trigger a round of new contracts’ awards to set up new terms. The State owned Taqnia
company has been signing some contracts with international companies but this
remains very limited at this stage.
Saudi commitment to defence spending positive for European Defence
Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Finance 2016 defence budget spending remains high at
SAR213bn (cUS$57bn) which is 25% of the total budget. In 2015, the budgeted defence
spending reached SAR307bn (US$82bn). Despite the large decrease in headline defence
and security expenditure, budgetary figures suggest the allocation for the Ministry of
Interior, Ministry of National Guard, Ministry of Defence, General Intelligence
Directorate, and Saudi Royal Guard Regiment could be heavily supported from elsewhere
in the budget, if required. Figures released by the Ministry of Finance suggest that
SAR183.0bn of the state budget for 2016 - c21% of total budgeted spending - will be
allocated through a new 'Budget Support Provision' that is to be used to give more
flexibility to the budget and redirect capital and operational expenditure in line with
national priorities and to fulfil spending requirements. In our view, the commitment to
defence spending is positive for companies who have presence in the area, BAE (Buy,
600p) & Thales (Buy, €87).
BAE Systems ties to Saudi Arabia go as far back as 1966, when the company was
contracted to Lightning and Strikemaster aircraft and equipment in a programme called
the ‘Magic Carpet’. In 1985, a new government-to-government (UK/Saudi Arabia)
agreement was signed covering supply and support of Tornado, Hawk and PC-9 aircraft.
A new government-to-government agreement, known as the Saudi British Defence Cooperation
Programme, was inaugurated at the start of 2007. Salam Project, which
GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 75
provides for the acquisition of 72 Typhoon aircraft in a programme aimed at the
modernisation of the Saudi Armed Forces, was launched in September 2007. This
carries substantial packages of work and expertise transfers, aimed at developing the
Saudi industrial defence sector. BAE Systems has made a major commitment to the
training of local nationals to bring them into management, technical and other qualified
positions. Saudis constitute 21% of BAE’s group sales, 57% of the total BAE Systems'
workforce in Saudi Arabia making the Company one of the largest private sector
employers of Saudis with 5,000 employees based locally. The UK and Saudi have
discussed in the past moving the final assembly of some of the 72 Typhoons in Saudi
Arabia but it failed. Now, the two countries may be trying to have locally produced
Hawks on the back of the 22 trainer order at the end of 2015, according to local press.
Thales (10% of group sales in the Middle East, mainly in defence) has an established
presence in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with 750 employees and a diversified portfolio
of activities. The company has built a mature relationship with Saudi Arabia based on
solid, country-wide partnerships. Thales’s major commercial successes include the
Shahine and Crotale air defence contracts with logistic support. In naval defence, Thales
is the prime contractor for the Sawari II contract (three frigates), that follows on from
the successful Sawari I programme (four frigates) for which Thales now provides logistic
support. In 2007, Thales was selected by the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Defence to
supply a major electronic protection system to the Royal Saudi Air Force.
US contractors such as Lockheed Martin (supplier of F16 jets, C130J transport planes),
General Dynamics (military vehicles) and Raytheon (missiles) have some local presence
in Saudi Arabia, but BAE is by in large the largest and historical local presence.

Price objective basis & risk
Al Hammadi (XBQYF)
Our SAR64 PO for Al Hammadi is based on our DCF-derived valuation. This is equivalent
to 32x FY17E EPS. Strong earnings growth means out-year valuations appear much
more reasonable than near-term valuations (e.g. implied 13x FY20E EPS). Company
specific risks are: lower-than-expected growth resulting from delays in executing on
expansion plans, inability to raise prices to offset cost inflation, failure to manage
growth without impacting margins, pricing pressure from insurers, new competition,
sustained delays to government payments, and any potentially dilutive acquisitions.
General/macro risks are: sustained low oil prices and any resultant slow-down in the
economy, civil unrest, ongoing failure of the government to pay bills.
Al Othaim (XWPJF)
We use a combination of DCF, DDM and peer group analysis to value Al Othaim. We
have taken a weighted average of values implied by our DCF, DDM and peer group
analyses. We attribute a 50% weight to the DCF and 25% weights for both the DDM and
the P/E multiple, which points to a PO of SAR121. We attribute a greater weight to the
DCF valuation as we believe food retailers offer good visibility on cash flow generation.
In the case of Al Othaim, we think DCF better reflects the stock's growth opportunity.
We assume a perpetuity growth rate of 2% and WACC of 9.1% in our DCF.
The downside risks to our investment case are:
- Weaker-than-expected margin performance
- Cannibalisation effect in Saudi Arabia
- Competition: We expect competition to intensify among the large organized players,
such as Savola-owned Panda which have aggressive retail expansion plans growth plan
- Saudization: Most of Al Othaim's labors are low level staff working in the warehouses
and branches which depends heavily on expatriate labors. This suggests the Saudization
of the staff could put further pressure on margins.
Almarai (XALRF)
We arrive at our SAR61/share price objective using a combination of P/E multiples and
DCF valuation, taking the average yielded by the two methods. More specifically:
GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 77
On a multiples basis, we value Almarai on 21x 2017E EPS, a 15% premium to Global
(blue chip) food producer averages. We believe that at this level it is fairly valued given
it is trading at a premium to its historical trading average and the weaker consumer
outlook.
Our DCF analysis yields a valuation of SAR59/share, based on a WACC of 8% and
terminal growth rate of 3.5%.
Risks to our PO are company specific factors such as plant outages, disease outbreaks
in its biological assets, delays in the investment program and factors affecting suppliers.
Macro level risks are commodity prices, government regulation, subsidy removals and
price pressures from growing competition.
BAE SYSTEMS (BAESF / BAESY)
Our PO of 600p (US$34.26/ADR) is an average based on DCF, 2016-17E P/E and
EV/EBITA and Sum-of-Parts. We regard as BAE's peers Lockheed Martin, LLL, General
Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, QinetiQ, Cobham, Ultra Electronics.
Our DCF valuation (8.7% WACC and 1.8% long-term growth rate in line with defence
peers and 10.7% long term margin) implies a 550p share price. Our SOP suggests at
valuation range of 592-595p, using peer group EV/EBITA multiples of 12.7-13.7x and
EV/sales of 1.2x. Applying EU and US peers multiples on EV/EBITA and P/E yields a
valuation range of 671-679p.
At 600p BAE would be trading on 14.6x 2016E P/E and at 13.9x 2016E EV/EBITA. This
P/E is in the middle of the historical range of c.20x to c.6x, and the EV/EBITA is near the
high end of the historical range of c.12x to c.4x.
Upside risks are: 1) An export contract for Typhoons, in particular an order for 60+
airplanes from Saudi, 2) USD strength against the UK, 3) development of a large scale
and long term conflict.
Downside risks are: 1) significant decrease to the US or UK defence budgets, below our
current assumptions, 2) significant weakness of the US$ vs Sterling.
Dallah Healthcare (XJEFF)
We set a SAR79 price objective for Dallah, which is equivalent to 23x FY17E EPS. We
expect earnings to double between FY15A and FY20E as beds triple. The multiple
therefore falls quickly and on FY20E earnings, when some of this growth is likely to
have come through, the stock trades in-line with other hospital stocks, both EM and
Saudi.
Upside risks are: greater price increases than assumed in forecasts, faster uptake of
new capacity, accretive M&A activity.
Down side risks are: Slowdown in the economy, lower-than-expected growth resulting
from delays in executing on expansion plans, inability to raise prices to offset cost
inflation, failure to manage growth without impacting margins
Dar Al Arkan (XARKF)
Our PO of SAR7.0/share is based on sum-of-the-parts methodology. We
employ a WACC of 10.7%, derived from a COE and COD of 11.1% and 9.0%,
respectively. Our SOTP includes (1) the NPV of the current development portfolio
to 2016E, (2) the NPV of recurring cash flows from investment portfolio + the NPV
of its terminal value minus incremental capex to complete the investment
programme, (3) the NPV of land sales from the developed land bank, and (4) the
book value (valued at cost) of DAAR s remaining land bank.
Downside risks: (1) Deterioration of demand for land would increase
the perceived liquidity risk (2) Deterioration of credit environment (3) Emergence
78 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016
of sub-developers which would inflate the acq. cost of land and consequently
depreciate the residual value of land due to lower margins (4) Mismanagement of
cash flows: a mismanagement of the resources (overspending in CAPEX for land
for example) could arise liquidity concerns because of over-exposure to land
sales mkt. Upside risks: A lower-than-expected borrowing cost: We
forecast an incremental cost of debt of 9%, A improvement in the credit
environment sensitive to exogenous factors such as liquidity and the risk appetite
of the international mkt. would lower DAAR s cost of funding, We see upside
valuation risk in the value of the land bank should the company manages to
develop housing units with the support of the Ministry of Housing. debt-financed
acquisition to boost its recurring income.
Extra (XYDUF)
We derive a PO of SAR 24 using a DCF valuation model which we believe best captures
differing capital costs and growth profiles across the MENA region. Key assumptions are
an 11% WACC and a 2% perpetuity growth rate. Upside/downside risks to our PO are
better/worse returns from better/worse like-for-like sales and shorter/longer break even
times from new international markets.
Jarir (XJRIF)
We derive a PO of SAR134 using a DCF valuation model which we believe best captures
the company's plan to add c.60% new stores by 2017. Key assumptions are: - a 5-year
CAGR in sales of 11% followed by an five-year CAGR of 6% and a perpetuity growth rate
of 2%, - an average EBIT margin of 13%, - a WACC of 9.5% with a beta of 0.9x. Our
WACC is calculated using a RFR of 5.0% and an ERP of 6.0%. We used a 2% terminal
growth rate.
The risks to our PO are company-specific issues such as a failure to deliver the expected
11% top-line growth or a faster-than-expected deterioration in electronics margins. In
addition, there are risks associated with a slowdown in the economy or consumer
spending.
Saudi Arabian Fertilizer Company (XDUAF)
We apply a justified P/E multiple to derive SAFCO's PO of SAR72. The P/E is based on a
normalized RoE of 30.2%, Cost of Equity of 10.4% and payout of 93.5%.
Upside risks to our price objective are: (1) delays in global nitrogen fertilizers capacity
expansions, which would result in a tighter supply of urea and effectively higher prices,
(2) Stronger demand for fertilizers and effectively prices, (3) An increase in the marginal
producer cost that effectively leads to a higher urea price floor.
Downside risks are: (1) lower prices of urea due to weaker than expected demand, (2)
Delay in SAFCO 5 expansion project, (3) an increase in natural gas cost.
Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (XAUBF)
We apply a justified P/E multiple to derive SABIC's PO of SAR99.5. The P/E is based on a
normalised RoE of 15.8%, Cost of Equity of 11.5% and payout of 65.0%
Downside risks to our price objective are a decline in the supply of low-cost feedstock, a
lower-than-expected recovery in petrochemicals prices, delays in the ramp-up of newly
established subsidiaries, or weakness in steel demand in Saudi Arabia.
Saudi Telecom Company (STC) (XUTUF)
We derive our SAR81/share PO for STC on a sum of the parts basis, using a combination
of DCF and market valuations for its core subsidiaries and associates, adjusting for
ownership stakes. Specifically, we use DCF to value its core operations in Saudi Arabia
(9.5% WACC), Viva Kuwait (10.5% WACC), and other subsidiaries (10.1% WACC). We
GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 79
assume a terminal growth rate of 2% across all of the markets, starting from 2023. For
STC's associates, we value its holdings in Oger Telecom and Binariang using a
combination of our Research team's valuation (for Oger's stake in Turk Telecom) and
book value. We then add STC's net cash position at YE 2015 in deriving our PO.
Risks to our PO come from potential market share loss as both Mobily and Zain KSA,
plus several MVNO's are aiming to take market share from STC domestically, following
recent cut in MTR's. Additionally, we see ongoing risk from FX exposure at their
subsidiary investments, especially their indirect stake in Turk Telekom.
Savola (XSAVF)
Given the diversified nature of the Savola group, we use a sum of the parts valuation in
deriving our SAR46/share price objective for Savola. Specifically, we:
Value the food business on 12x 2016 earnings, a 30% discount to global peers on
account have having slightly slower growth and risks presented by having a significant
position in Iran (which accounts for 13% of revenues).
Value retail(Panda) at 15x 2016 earnings, a c.10% discount to global peers on account of
having slower near term growth. we believe near term growth will be impacted by
continued aggressive expansion and slowing demand trends in the Saudi market
(following the introduction of the 2016 budget).
The investments business is valued using a variety of methods. For its stake in Almarai,
we value it in line with our price objective for the shares. Savola's interests in other
listed entities (Herfy, KEC and EEC) are valued at current market valuation given we do
not have research coverage on the names. The stakes in none listed entities including
the real estate book and private equity holdings are valued at 2x book value (YE2015).
Downside risks to our PO include higher cost escalation than we forecast, further
adverse moves in commodity prices , adverse FX movements in countries outside of
Saudi Arabia where Savola does business and any disruptions to its material Iranian
business.
THALES (THLEF)
To derive our Thales price objective of €87, we use a 2017E sum of the parts valuation,
using Rockwell Collins, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Ultra, and the EU Civil Aerospace
peer group as peers for the Aerospace/defence segments, and Ansaldo STAS as a peer
for the transport business.
At €87 Thales would trade on 18.1x 2017E P/E and 12.3x EV/EBITA which we think is
appropriate given balance sheet/ portfolio optionality and building order momentum.
Upside/Downside risks to our price objective are: 1) changes in the company's free float,
2) assets swap and portfolio changes could add more value than we currently estimate
3) lower/more French defence cuts than we currently estimate.
YANSAB (XUYNF)
We apply a justified P/E multiple to derive YANSAB's PO of SAR48. The P/E is based on
a normalized RoE of 14.5%, Cost of Equity of 11% and payout of 70%
Downside risks to our price objective are: 1. Lower-than-expected demand for polyester
would adversely impact MEG prices and effectively earnings 2. Unexpected change in
feedstock prices could negatively impact earnings 3. Unexpected shutdowns that would
result in lower production.
80 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016
Zain KSA (XOCTF)
We use a DCF valuation model to derive our price objective of SAR 12.2. Key
assumptions are a discount rate of 11.0%, underpinned by a risk free rate of 5.5%, a
cost of equity of 29% and a 6.5% cost of debt. We explicitly forecast free cash flows
until 2022 and then assume perpetuity growth of 3%, as we do when valuing other Gulf
operators. Our forecasts take in to account the repayment of the deferred royalty loan
afforded to Zain in 2013 (repayments starting from 2021).
Downside risks are greater pricing pressure from MVNOs, the loss of its appeal against
a SAR620mn tax claim, an unfavourable ruling against Zain KSA in its arbitration process
with Mobily and an inability to grow market share and margins, which in turn would
threaten capital requirements.

are covered. CDS and equity preferreds are rated separately and issuer recommendations do not apply to them.
BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research credit recommendations are assigned using a three-month time horizon:
Overweight: Spreads and /or excess returns are likely to outperform the relevant and comparable market over the next three months.
Marketweight: Spreads and/or excess returns are likely to perform in-line with the relevant and comparable market over the next three months.
Underweight: Spreads and/or excess returns are likely to underperform the relevant and comparable market over the next three months.
BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research uses the following rating system with respect to Credit Default Swaps (CDS):
Buy Protection: Buy CDS, therefore going short credit risk.

'He doesn't like this sh*t': Trump 
reportedly hates his job and his staff after 
less than a month 
TRAVIS GETTYS 
10 FEB 2017 AT 08:38 ET 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030868 
Donald Trump (screen capture) 
DON'T MISS STORIES. FOLLOW RAW STORY! 
After just three weeks on the job, President Donald Trump is reportedly frustrated with the realities of trying to 
run the U.S. government the way he manages his family-owned business. 
Politico interviewed nearly two dozen people who have spent time with the former real estate developer and 
reality TV star since his inauguration — and they said Trump's mood has careened between surprise and anger 
as he's faced the predictable realities of governing, according to the report. 
The interviews paint a picture of a powder-keg of a workplace where job duties are unclear, morale among 
some is low, factionalism is rampant and exhaustion is running high, Politico reported. Two visitors to the 
White House last week said they were struck by how tired the staff looks. 
Trump would like to shake up his White House staff less than a month into the job but knows it's too soon, the 
website reported, and aides joke that the president would like to spend even more time golfing at his Mar-A-
Lago resort. 
Sources close to Trump said he's infuriated by the profusion of leaks revealing his confrontational phone calls 
with world leaders and the herky-jerky inner workings of the White House. 
The White House has launched an investigation of those leaks that appears to be focused on the National 
Security Council, based on the Politico report. 
NSC staffers have been instructed to cooperate with the inquiry, and the administration may tighten the inner 
circle of aides who have access to the calls and their transcripts, the website reported. 
A culture of fear and paranoia is developing, pitting the president and his allies against career NSC staff 
assigned from other agencies. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030869 
The Trump circle believe those career bureaucrats are out to get them, while NSC staffers are concerned the 
president isn't up to the job and resent the politicization of the agency by appointing Bannon to the council. 
Staffers fear Kushner because he's so close to the president, and they aren't really sure of his official role in the 
White House. 
For his part, Kushner is furious at reports that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has been saying he will join the 
White House as part of a second wave after the president's son-in-law got him banished from the transition 
team as retribution for prosecuting his father. 
Sources said Trump often asks simple questions about his job, and he usually changes the subject when 
discussions become too detail-oriented to make it seem as if he's in control, said one senior government official. 
Trump prefers to hand off detailed questions to his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, or to chief strategist Steve 
Bannon or House Speaker Paul Ryan, the website reported. 
Those sources also revealed that Trump has privately expressed disbelief that judges, bureaucrats and 
lawmakers are able to halt him from filling government positions or implementing policies. 
He doesn't like this sh*t, a source told Politico, referring to the difficulties Trump faced in getting one of his 
top fundraisers, Anthony Scaramucci, appointed to a job in the West Wing. 
However, sources said Trump appears to enjoy showing visitors around the Oval Office, where he spends most 
of his working hours, and keeping tabs on how his staffers look on TV news.

claims where the statute of limitations had expired. Therefore, will be able to sue 
Mr. Epstein for the sexual abuse which she experienced while she was a minor. 
was the perfect victim. 
She was born in M, a town on the coast. When was four years 
old, descended into civil war. At the age of six, her entire village was evacuated. She 
fled her hometown travelling through war zones on foot with her family, in a stream of refugees. 
Her family settled in the outskirts of . As refugees, with no money, her family 
lived together in one room, sharing a bathroom with other families. Her parents eventually 
found low paying, unskilled jobs. Their only clothing was what was provided to them by the 
Red Cross.

wanted to leave She learned about a talent search for models and persuaded her 
mother to take her. She was a huge success and began modeling at age fourteen. Though her 
parents disparaged her for marketing her appearance, they allowed her to work because she 
earned more than their combined income. 
At age sixteen, moved to New York City to model. She lived in an 
apartment for models, with one or two roommates and no adult on the premises. Her father was 
deeply ashamed of her because he disapproved of her profession and her parents distanced 
themselves. 
days were hectic with professional assignments. She worked with top tier 
clients and for DNA Modeling Agency, a well-known agency representing supermodels such as 
Linda Evangelista and Natalia Vodianova. 
was very innocent and inexperienced prior to meeting Mr. Epstein. At age 
sixteen, experienced her first kiss. The director of a perfume campaign, Fabian 
Barron, wanted a kiss at the end of the commercial as a finale to a perfume ad. She dreaded her 
parents' reaction to seeing the commercial. She was raised in the Orthodox Christian Church 
where abstinence was encouraged. 
met Jeffrey Epstein when was sixteen years old. She was introduced 
through a fellow model a few years her senior. 
Mr. Epstein seemed bigger than life. He did not drink or do drugs, which put her at ease. 
He was friends with former President Bill Clinton, the President who made it possible for ME 
and her family to immigrate to America. When she told Mr. Epstein how her family 
came to America, Mr. Epstein said he would personally thank Bill for her. Mr. Epstein touted 
other impressive connections. He made it known that he had A list celebrities on speed-dial. 
She felt very fortunate to have made the connection with Mr. Epstein. 
As s estrangement from her family increased, Mr. Epstein's role in her life 
became more and more important. He encouraged her and built her confidence. She trusted him 
completely. 
Mr. Epstein told hat he was on the board of directors at Harvard 
University. He promised that once she took her SATs and obtained the scores she needed, he 
would write a letter of recommendation for her, which he said would carry significant weight 
with regard to her admission. Her dream was to establish herself as a successful model and to 
one day graduate from Harvard. Mr. Epstein made her feel that everything she wanted was 
possible.

confided to him that she had never even had a boyfriend. He told her 
everything would fall into place, just keep doing what you are doing, work hard and stay 
focused. She told Mr. Epstein that she preferred to abstain from sex until she was married. 
The first time asked her for a massage was to help with an ache in his 
shoulder. thought it was an innocent request. He said his masseuse had failed to 
get a kink out of his shoulder. He gave her a large purple massager for her to use to take the knot 
out of his back. Mr. Epstein told her she was an excellent masseuse and she was pleased to be 
able to ease his pain. 
When the massage ended, Mr. Epstein pulled two hundred dollars from his wallet and 
handed it to her. He said, I was going to give it to the masseuse anyway, so you take it and pay 
for your car service or something. 
Mr. Epstein began calling her every day, no matter where she was in the world. He told 
her he loved her. He became a vital part of_________________Iworld as her parents remained 
distant. He invited her to stay at one of his apartments close to him on the Upper East Side. Her 
arduous work schedule, starting with 6:00 a.m. call times and shows running late into the night 
were exhausting. Epstein's daily check-up calls and pep talks gave her strength to survive her 
grinding schedule. 
When in Paris, Mr. Epstein allowed her to stay at his home with her sister and arranged 
for a night out at a concert with Naomi Campbell. It appeared to that Mr. Epstein's 
thoughts were focused on her career, future and good fortune. 
The first time the purple massage tool found its way between her legs, told 
him to stop, but Mr. Epstein pushed the head of the massager firmly against her and forced her 
legs apart. She felt ashamed and embarrassed. The massages became a ritual and were always 
accompanied with sexual abuse and a two-hundred dollar payment at the end. 
Mr. Epstein approached her as if he was her mentor and teacher, teaching her about 
sexuality, opening her eyes. She experienced immense orgasms, and then shame and fear. She 
felt claustrophobia as she stared up into Mr. Epstein's church-like ceiling of the massage parlor 
while he fondled her. She felt she couldn't escape her position, and that this was the way it had 
to be because this powerful man orchestrated it. At the end of each massage he would make 
himself ejaculate by demanding she pay vigorous attention to his nipples with her fingers and he 
would tell her what a good girl she was, that he loved her and would call her later, which made 
everything seem better. Then he would open his wallet filled with hundred dollar bills and give 
her a couple, which she accepted as pocket money, never thinking twice about it.

thought this is what it must feel like to become a woman. She was both 
thrilled and ashamed. She followed the path that Mr. Epstein set out for her because he said if 
she trusted him and did what he told her to do, everything would go according to his plan and her 
career would soar. Without him the world was a scary and unpredictable place. When she was 
with him, she felt like everything was right because of how much love and care she received 
from him. She started to think and believe that they would be together and that he would marry 
her. 
He used the purple massage vibrator on her time and time again. She closed her eyes 
feeling lost, overwhelmed and out of control. 
When he stuck his penis in her mouth, she did what she was told. She choked and 
gagged and when she tried to move her head away he forced it back into place. Mr. Epstein was 
extremely aggressive. When it was over he told her how amazing she was. She continued to 
believe in Mr. Epstein's friendship and guidance. 
Mr. Epstein took her virginity. This was the trajectory for which he groomed her. = 
first sexual experience was devoid of tenderness or affection. She was stripped down 
and made to shower. Mr. Epstein told her, If you're lying about being a virgin, or I get a 
disease from you, I'll kill you. She felt her mind separate from her body during intercourse. 
She began to feel like a shell of her former self. She was mortified and in agony. She 
felt she had become everything her parents feared she would become. She was appearing in 
beauty magazines and making hundreds of thousands of dollars, but felt dirty and worthless. Mr. 
Epstein made her feel like nothing more than a teenage prostitute. Everything came crashing 
down once she realized that this was not love. 
left Mr. Epstein's residence for the last time feeling less than human. On 
her way out, she passed a young girl who appeared to be another young model. As 
turned around to glance back, she saw the young woman entering Mr. Epstein's residence. She 
was disgusted with the realization that she was one of many called to massage Epstein.

had been victimized. It shattered her to her core. At the vulnerable age of 16, Mr. Epstein made 
himself the center of her existence and the master of her world. She realized she was a 
disposable pawn in his game. She could not talk about her years with Mr. Epstein because she 
was consumed with shame. At 16 years old, he isolated her and made himself her only 
emotional support system. Her mental torment and pain turned into depression. She was 
prescribed medication. She numbed herself and tried not to deal with what had happened. She 
tried to block the pain. 
____________was embarrassed that she had been used and abused. She withdrew and had 
no desire to model or interact with anyone in the modeling world anymore. 
stopped taking calls from modeling agencies, and eventually they stopped calling for good. She 
was afraid to go to New York where her emotions and memories would be triggered. 
The final contact between and Mr. Epstein was when he tracked her 
parent's house phone number in Kansas and tried to speak to her. mother 
grabbed the phone and told Mr. Epstein she was calling the police before hanging up on him. 
Her career dwindled to nothing. Taking a break from the modeling industry when clients 
like Italian Vogue and Victoria's Secret were requesting bookings constituted career suicide. 
In Kansas she became chronically depressed. She was suicidal before her 18th birthday. 
She called the suicide hotline many times from her home. 
While in Kansas, a friend of________________ent her an email with news that Mr. Epstein 
had been arrested for trafficking underaged girls. felt as if she had gone from 
being a supermodel to becoming an unsuspecting prostitute. Her parents' warnings of what 
would become of her in New York had come to fruition. She fell prey to a child predator, Mr. 
Epstein, and it took her a decade to understand the gravity of what Epstein had done to her as a 
vulnerable young girl. 
Mr. Epstein mas ueraded as a loving mentor, a parental substitute and friend who had 
nothing bul best interest in mind. The repercussions of the sexual and mental 
abuseendured remain with her. Her first sexual encounters are forever scarred by 
memories of Mr. Epstein forcing his purple massage device between her legs amidst her cries for 
him to stop. Debilitating nausea and stomach pain followed her separation from him. She had 
no framework with which to reference what a normal sexual experience was. She remains 
plagued with self-doubt and insecurity and finds it nearly impossible to separate memories of 
Mr. Epstein's manipulation and abuse from new relationships she tries to develop.

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031166.txt,"My own business perspective has been limited to that small hotel and restaurant in Stratford, Conn., with an
especially difficult lease and a severe recession. But my business associates and I also lived with federal, state
and local rules that were all passed with the objective of helping employees, protecting the environment, raising
tax dollars for schools, protecting our customers from fire hazards, etc. While I never doubted the worthiness of
any of these goals, the concept that most often eludes legislators is: ‘Can we make consumers pay the higher
prices for the increased operating costs that accompany public regulation and government reporting
requirements with reams of red tape.' It is a simple concern that is nonetheless often ignored by legislators
[e]. For example, the papers today are filled with stories about businesses dropping health coverage for
employees. We provided a substantial package for our staff at the Stratford Inn. However, were we operating
today, those costs would exceed $150,000 a year for health care on top of salaries and other benefits. There
would have been no reasonable way for us to absorb or pass on these costs.

Some of the escalation in the cost of health care is attributed to patients suing doctors. While one cannot assess
the merit of all these claims, I've also witnessed firsthand the explosion in blame-shifting and scapegoating for
every negative experience in life. Today, despite bankruptcy, we are still dealing with litigation from
individuals who fell in or near our restaurant. Despite these injuries, not every misstep is the fault of someone
else. Not every such incident should be viewed as a lawsuit instead of an unfortunate accident. And while the
business owner may prevail in the end, the endless exposure to frivolous claims and high legal fees is
frightening.

Our Connecticut hotel, along with many others, went bankrupt for a variety of reasons, the general economy in
the Northeast being a significant cause. But that reason masks the variety of other challenges we faced that
drive operating costs and financing charges beyond what a small business can handle. It is clear that some
businesses have products that can be priced at almost any level. The price of raw materials (e.g., steel and glass)
and life-saving drugs and medical care are not easily substituted by consumers. It is only competition or
antitrust that tempers price increases. Consumers may delay purchases, but they have little choice when faced
with higher prices. In services, however, consumers do have a choice when faced with higher prices. You may
have to stay in a hotel while on vacation, but you can stay fewer days. You can eat in restaurants fewer times
per month, or forgo a number of services from car washes to shoeshines. Every such decision eventually results
in job losses for someone. And often these are the people without the skills to help themselves--the people I've
spent a lifetime trying to help.

In short, “one-size-fits-all” rules for business ignore the reality of the market place. And setting thresholds for
regulatory guidelines at artificial levels--e.g., 50 employees or more, $500,000 in sales--takes no account of
other realities, such as profit margins, labor intensive vs. capital intensive businesses, and local market
economics. The problem we face as legislators is: Where do we set the bar so that it is not too high to
clear? I don't have the answer. I do know that we need to start raising these questions more often.

So, there you have it, one of the more remarkable epiphanies in American politics: a paean to entrepreneurship
and government restraint from one of its most progressive members. Public epiphanies like this are rare, but there
have been others. Last year, Al Gore conceded that first-generation ethanol was “not good policy” given its low energy
conversion ratios, and said he had supported ethanol out of ‘“‘a certain fondness for the farmers in the state of Iowa
because I was about to run for president” [f]. In 2008, former Fed Chair Greenspan conceded that his Ayn Rand
philosophies regarding regulations and shareholder self-interest were flawed. Perhaps the most famous epiphany was
from Robert McNamara, Secretary of Defense and one of the principal architects of the Vietnam War. In 1995, he
conceded that he was “wrong, terribly wrong” about the war. George McGovern was one of the war’s fiercest opponents,
saying on the floor of the Senate, “I'm tired of old men dreaming up wars for young men to fight”.

There may be no magic elixir of policies to speed the adjustment the US faces. Look at it this way: the US is trying the
mega-stimulus route, while the UK has accelerated its fiscal austerity program. Yet both countries are struggling with
below-trend growth and employment. Perhaps after a debt binge, there are no easy answers, other than time. What to do
next? McGovern’s article suggests that an overly interventionist public sector may be the wrong answer, given the
unintended consequences.

high IQ. Functional MRI scans show intelligent people use more neurons
when tackling a given mental task, perhaps bringing to bear greater raw
horsepower, but this is not really an explanation. It is akin to saying Usain
Bolt runs faster because he gets more power to his legs. This is obvious.
What we want to know is how.

The problem with looking at brains for a common cause is the
variation from brain to brain. We all have different genes and life
experiences. On top of this, we really only see brains post mortem and
this tends to confound comparisons of brain structure. One way to
minimize the variation is to use separated identical twins. Twins have
identical genes so their fundamental hardware is the same. We should be
able to see features of the brain that are common to smart sets of twins but
absent in less smart pairs. If a feature is not shared it can be discounted as
something accidental, caused by disease, environment, or the like.

When we examine smart twins, they appear to have greater
myelination of their neurons. Myelin is a flat protein that acts as an
insulating sheath, wrapping the nerves and the neurons in our brain.
Myelination appears to be part of the mechanism involved in laying
down long-term memory — more myelin, more memories. It may also
help sustain signals and allow them to move faster over a longer distance:
the increased insulation allowing the brain to include information from
more distant parts of the brain within a given thought. But increased
myelination may be an effect of higher intelligence rather than a cause.
The brain is responsible for a significant part of our overall energy
consumption so insulating the neurons might simply help with energy
conservation. This is an active area of research.

Evolution also gives a clue to the causes of intelligence. Humans,
nonhuman primates, and dolphins all share spindle neurons. These
spread across the brain and appear to help us coordinate complex
actions between the different parts. The high function intelligence that
characterizes these disparate species requires a great deal of cooperation
between different areas of the brain. Take playing a musical instrument.
This uses physical coordination (motor cortex), sound processing
(auditory cortex), rhythm (another part of the motor cortex), along
with emotional interpretation (amygdala). Humans have more spindle
cells than other animals so this might explain our superior ability in
performing these complex tasks.

However plausible these ideas, they are all hardware arguments. It
is like me saying my word processor is better than yours because it has
gold plated connectors. That might be true — it might allow the machine
to run a little faster without electrical errors creeping in, but we all know

http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey-epstein-200303

Here are some of the hard facts about Epstein—ones that he doesn’t mind people knowing: He
grew up middle-class in Brooklyn. His father worked for the city’s parks department. His parents
viewed education as “the way out” for him and his younger brother, Mark, now working in real
estate. Jeffrey started to play the piano—for which he maintains a passion—at five, and he went
to Brooklyn’s Lafayette High School. He was good at mathematics, and in his early 20s he got a
job teaching physics and math at Dalton, the elite Manhattan private school. While there he
began tutoring the son of Bear Stearns chairman Ace Greenberg and was friendly with a
daughter of Greenberg’s. Soon he went to Bear Stearns, where, under the mentorship of both
Greenberg and current Bear Stearns C.E.O. James Cayne, he did well enough to become a
limited partner—a rung beneath full partner. He abruptly departed in 1981 because, he has said,
he wanted to run his own business.

Thereafter the details recede into shadow. A few of the handful of current friends who have
known him since the early 1980s recall that he used to tell them he was a “bounty hunter,”
recovering lost or stolen money for the government or for very rich people. He has a license to
carry a firearm. For the last 15 years, he’s been running his business, J. Epstein & Co.

Since Leslie Wexner appeared in his life—Epstein has said this was in 1986; others say it was in
1989, at the earliest—he has gradually, in a way that has not generally made headlines, come to
be accepted by the Establishment. He’s a member of various commissions and councils: he is on
the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, the New York Academy of
Sciences, and the Institute of International Education.

His current fan club extends to Cayne, Henry Rosovsky, the former dean of Harvard’s Faculty of
Arts and Sciences, and Larry Summers, Harvard’s current president. Harvard law professor Alan
Dershowitz says, “I’m on my 20th book.... The only person outside of my immediate family that
I send drafts to is Jeffrey.” Real-estate developer and philanthropist Marshall Rose, who has
worked with Epstein on projects in New Albany, Ohio, for Wexner, says, “He digests and
decodes the information very rapidly, which is to me terrific because we have shorter meetings.”

Also on the list of admirers are former senator George Mitchell and a gaggle of distinguished
scientists, most of whom Epstein has helped fund in recent years. They include Nobel Prize
winners Gerald Edelman and Murray Gell-Mann, and mathematical biologist Martin Nowak.
When these men describe Epstein, they talk about “energy” and “curiosity,” as well as a love for
theoretical physics that they don’t ordinarily find in laymen. Gell-Mann rather sweetly mentions
that “there are always pretty ladies around” when he goes to dinner chez Epstein, and he’s under
the impression that Epstein’s clients include the Queen of England. Both Nowak and Dershowitz
were thrilled to find themselves shaking the hand of a man named “Andrew” in Epstein’s house.
“Andrew” turned out to be Prince Andrew, who subsequently arranged to sit in the back of
Dershowitz’s law class.

Epstein gets annoyed when anyone suggests that Wexner “made him.” “I had really rich clients
before,” he has said. Yet he does not deny that he and Wexner have a special relationship.
Epstein sees it as a partnership of equals. “People have said it’s like we have one brain between
two of us: each has a side.”

actions that fall into a gray area. Let me explain something: No means no. There is no
gray area.

But in many date rape situations, the alleged victim didn’t say no. Nor did she say yes. There are
grey areas.

I received countless letters, phone calls, and personal attacks denouncing me for agreeing to
represent Tyson on his appeal. Here are some excerpts from the letters:

It’s too bad that a punk like Tyson can afford to pay for the top legal representation... but
since you had the right to refuse to represent him, I fault you!

It saddens me that you yourself continue to worship at the altar of the great god of
violence and fear of women.

Mr. Tyson is a convicted rapist with obvious psychological problems who needs a
psychiatrist not an attorney who will argue excuses for his behavior! If, through your
efforts, Mike Tyson is not held accountable for his behavior, then you do a disservice to
all women and we become victims of a pandemic legal system gone awry!

Mike Tyson? He doesn’t deserve the best—it’s a shanda!! (“Shanda” is the Yiddish for
“shame.”)

When you choose to represent someone like Mike Tyson, you attach the Jewish
community to your action...I now find it hard to understand how you can mount a
passionate defense for a convicted rapist.

Shame on you, Alan Dershowitz, if you handle this appeal.

The most surprising response came from some Harvard Law School students, who should
understand that our adversary system of justice requires that all convicted defendants be accorded
a zealous appeal.

I don’t know what actually took place in Mike Tyson’s hotel room on that fateful night, but it
may well have fallen into the category of gray area. He believed that she wanted to sleep with
him. She may have been ambivalent or sending mixed signals (though I doubt it). It was a close
case and Tyson was entitled to have his defense presented vigorously, both at trial and on appeal.

Yet several of my students strongly objected to their teacher representing “a convicted rapist.” A
couple of them even threatened to file “sexual harassment” charged against me because my
representation of Tyson created a “hostile environment” for students who believed he was guilty.

The protest then broadened to the way I discussed the crime of rape in class. In my criminal law
class, I teach the law of rape as an example of a cutting-edge subject that poses a sharp conflict
between the rights of defendants and their accusers. As usual, I take a “devil’s advocate” position
on politically correct issues. For example, although I personally oppose capital punishment, I

something I find myself wondering from time to time? Is there not a similar risk
if we miss the signs of an opportunity for peace?”

His words stuck with me for the rest of my time in public life. They also had
a strong impact on me at the time. One of the benefits of my job was that I
could read the full inquiry report from the 1973 war, including the portions that
had been kept classified. Some dealt with the political situation before the war.
Golda had relied heavily on a “kitchen cabinet” of trusted ministers and a few
close advisers. The inquiry material described how Sadat had been extending
negotiating feelers before the war. And how Golda, Eli Zeira, Dado and Dayan
had responded. It was like an exercise in collective reinforcement. They agreed
the Arab countries would not simply go on living with the humiliation of their
defeat in 1967. At some stage, they would try to regain the initiative, on the
battlefield. But none appeared to think through the implications of this for our
political approach. Perhaps, like Eli Zeira in 1967, they assumed a kind of
historical inevitability of Israeli trtumph. Though we’d ending up prevailing in
1973, it was impossible not to wonder whether, as Shlomo suggested, we had
missed the signs of a possible peace beforehand.

Now, however, we were facing an escalating challenge from an enemy with
no interest in peace: the armed Palestinian groups. The Democratic Front took
over a school in northern Israel a half-year after the war. In March 1975, Fatah
had seized the Savoy. And about a year into my posting in the Airya, the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine launched an even more audacious
operation.

It became known by the name of the airport where the ordeal ended.
Entebbe. And when it began I, like Uzi Yairi, was sitting at my desk.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019754.txt,"266 | HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS

Alexander Litvinenko, I had interviewed Andrei Lugovoy. A former
KGB officer assigned to protecting the Kremlin’s top members in the
1990s, Lugovoy later opened his own security company. In 2005, he
became a business associate of Litvinenko’s in gathering informa-
tion and made regular trips to London to meet with him. Because
he had tea with Litvinenko at the Pine Bar of the Millennium Hotel
in London on November 1, 2006, the day Litvinenko was poisoned,
he became the main suspect in the British investigation. He could
not be extradited, however. After reconstructing the chronology of
the crime, I established that Litvinenko had been contaminated with
polonium at a Japanese restaurant some four hours before his tea
with Lugovoy. I therefore wrote that the crime scene might not have
been at the Pine Bar, a finding that he said he greatly appreciated.

Lugovoy was elected to the Duma in 2007 and also hosted a
twenty-four-part television series on espionage for which Putin per-
sonally decorated him. He was also now reputed to be in the inner
circle of power in Moscow. So I called him.

We arranged to meet in the bar of the Hotel National. A short

© but well-built man with a bullet-style haircut, Lugovoy showed ©
up promptly at 1:00 p.m. After discussing some of the subsequent
developments in the still-lingering polonium investigation, I asked
him if he knew Kucherena.

“T don’t know him, but I know someone who does,” he answered.
“Why are you interested in seeing Kucherena?”

I told him that I wanted to speak to him about Snowden but I had
been unable to arrange a meeting.

“That’s no problem,” he said, raising his cell phone (which never
left his hand). He hit a number on the speed dial and spoke rapidly
in Russian (which I do not understand). He cupped his hand over the
phone and asked how long I would be in Moscow. After I told him
that I was leaving that Friday, he spoke again in Russian to the per-
son on the other end. “You will have an appointment on Thursday,”
he said.

Later that afternoon, Valentina, Kucherena’s assistant, called to
say that Kucherena would be happy to see me at his office at 6:00 p.m.
on Thursday. I didn’t ask Lugovoy whom he had called. Whomever
Lugovoy called obviously had the power to arrange the meeting.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013719.txt,"Réssler’s generic chaotic system (see above) moving recurrently in a three

dimensional box can be orthogonally decomposed into three directional motions in a
moving frame, each with a signatory sign of 2. The unstable direction of expansive
stretching is characterized by some number > 0, A(+), the stable direction of
contractive folding, some number, < 0, A(-), and the neutrally stable direction of
recurrence, (0). For The “Lyapounov spectrum” of the Réssler attractor is
[A(4), A(-),4(0)] (Shaw, 1981). An n-dimensional dynamical systems has n one-
dimensional Lyapounov exponents, and it is sometimes the case in relatively noise
free, finite semi-stationary data lengths of the neurosciences, that a 2>0 can be
shown to exist for a second one, in a dynamical situation called “hyperchaos” by
(Rossler, 1979). For example, two and sometimes three 4(+) have been reported in

the flows on the EEG attractor of normal alert subjects (Gallez and Babloyantz,
1991). The presence of measurement noise, the finiteness of neurophysiological
sample lengths as well as the relatively small expansive actions in some directions

in the chaotic attractors of brain dynamics lead to the finding that most often, only
one “leading Lyapounov exponent,” 4(+), is reliably computable (Sano and

Sawada, 1885; Wolf et al, 1985; Eckmann et al, 1986).

A counter-intuitive fact about the stability of a dynamical system when a
decrease in the value of 4(+)is observed such that 2(+)—> A(0), is that this more
neutral stability augers a global bifurcation (Guckenheimer and Holmes, 1983). A
small perturbation does not change the global dynamics of an already expanding
and contracting (called “hyperbolic”) dynamical system, it will maintain the style of
its motions. However, when 4(+)—> 1(0), a velocity changing perturbation evokes a
bifurcation to a new dynamic in what is called “loss of hyperbolic stability.” The best
examples come from the observations of this kind of change in the EEG predicting
the onset of epileptic seizures in patients with focal or temporal lobe epilepsy
(lasemidis et al, 1988,1990; lasemidis and Sackellares, 1996 ).

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014076.txt,"2014] CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS 97

wanted to treat victims unfairly. Given its repeated and professed
commitment to crime victims, here too this obligation should not be
burdensome. And finally, with regard to providing notice of CVRA rights
to victims, the fact that the Department currently provides notice of VRRA
rights indicates that it should not be difficult to provide notice of CVRA
rights as well.

Indeed, it is possible that the Department’s notification letters under
the VRRA already include this information. Interestingly, in the Epstein
case, the FBI notified Jane Doe Number One and Jane Doe Number Two
that they had rights in the criminal justice process. As early as June 7,
2007—more than three months before it concluded a nonprosecution
agreement with Epstein—the U.S. Attorney’s Office sent a notice to Jane
Doe Number One stating “your case is under investigation.””’> The notice
also informed Jane Doe Number One that “as a victim and/or witness of a
federal offense, you have a number of rights.””'° Among the rights that the
U.S. Attorney’s Office told Jane Doe that she possessed was “t]he
reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the United States in the
case.”’!’ Of course, she would not have had those rights if she was not
covered by the CVRA. The FBI therefore apparently assumed that the
CVRA already applied in the Epstein case. It was only later, when the
matter went into litigation, that the Department of Justice reversed course.
This change in course underscores the problems arising out of the OLC
memorandum and the Department’s current interpretation of the CVRA.

D. STATE LAW EXTENSION OF PRE-CHARGING RIGHTS

The focus of this Article so far has been crime victims’ rights in the
federal system. But in concluding, it is instructive to note how a number of
states offer parallel nghts for crime victims, including the right to confer
with prosecutors. In fact, several states have extended such nghts prior to
formally filing of charges against defendants—without reported difficulty,
so far as we are aware. This confirms our inference that extending CVRA
rights to crime victims before the formal filing of criminal charges is both
feasible and desirable.

A general overview of state laws illustrates the broad protections
afforded to victims in state criminal justice systems. Nearly two-thirds of
states have adopted constitutional provisions to protect victims throughout

and fined $6,000 for recruiting Czech women to a prostitution ring with
promises of modeling work.

Ronald Eppinger had faced up to 10 years after pleading guilty this month to
charges of alien smuggling for prostitution, interstate travel for prostitution and
money laundering.

Eppinger worked with two Czech women to get tourist visas for the future rs
prostitutes and kept nearly half of their earnings from operations in Miami, New wv FRI Tenn

York, Texas and the Bahamas, prosecutors said. Women were brought to the United States illegally from 1997 to 1999.

As part of his plea, Eppinger forfeited a boat and limousine used to promote the call-girl service.

Eppinger learned he was under investigation in June 1999 and moved from the United States to the Czech capital of Prague.

He was arrested in Germany last December while traveling from the Czech Republic to Spain and was sent to the United
States in May.

9.2. Note Payable to KULG by KU Education, Inc.

On January 6, 2005, KU Education, Inc., a Delaware corporation and subsidiary of KUE (KUE Inc.”)
executed a promissory note in favor of KULG, an entity controlled by the Principals, in the amount of
$200.0 million, the proceeds of which were used in connection with the acquisition of KinderCare by
KLC. This note has a seven year maturity and accrues interest at the “reference rate” set by Bank of
America plus 1.25% per annum. The note may be prepaid, in whole or in part, without any premium or
penalty. As of April 1, 2006, KUE Inc. owes approximately $183.9 million under the note.

9.3. Term Loan Facility

On March 29, 2006, Knowledge Universe Education LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“KUE
LLC”), entered into a six-month $150 million term loan facility with an affiliate of Credit Suisse, one of the
Agents. The proceeds of the $150 million term loan were used to repay existing debt of KUE LLC to
entities controlled by Michael Milken.

The term loan facility is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by KUE LLC's direct and indirect parents and
the parent guaranty is several. Upon contribution of assets to KUE by KUE LLC, KUE will become a co-
borrower. It is expected that this Term Loan Facility will be repaid with the proceeds of this offering.

The term loan bears interest at either the reserve adjusted LIBOR rate plus 0.125% or the base rate
(generally the applicable prime lending rate, as announced from time to time), at KUE’s option and is

secured by cash collateral. KUE is permitted to voluntarily prepay the term loan, in whole or in part,
without premium or penalty, upon the giving of proper notice.

NYT

Europe’s Contagion

Editorial

November 16, 2011 -- Two years of gross mismanagement of the
euro-zone debt crisis have all too predictably produced a wider crisis
of market confidence that now threatens the entire 17-nation euro
zone. This week’s formation of new technocrat-led governments in
Greece and Italy has not calmed fears. Practically every euro zone
country is paying the price in higher interest costs and ebbing
economic growth.

The only country that isn’t suffering — yet — is Germany, whose
competitive export-driven economy feeds on foreign demand and an
exchange rate held down by its neighbors’ troubles. But all European
countries cannot be Germany and run net surpluses, especially if
Berlin insists on policies that keep factories shuttered and workers
unemployed.

And German leaders are wrong if they think their country will remain
unscathed as its major trading partners and neighbors unravel.
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has been talking a more pro-
European line. But she is still insisting on growth-killing austerity as
the price for European bailouts and still blocking the European
Central Bank from printing more euros and acting as a lender of last
resort.

Mrs. Merkel’s advisers insist that she is doing what the German
people want. That is not leadership. She needs to challenge her
voters’ simplistic stereotypes of southern European sloth and tell
them the truth: The real threat to Germany isn’t inflation; it is an
economic collapse across Europe. And Germany has a huge amount
to lose from a fracturing of the European Union.

Marlon Brando

I have a small apartment in New York, which my wife and I use for weekend trips to the Opera
and other Manhattan events. On this particular weekend, I lent it out to my cousin and doctor,
Harold Solomon. He called me from the apartment and said that while he was out, a message
was left on the machine from a guy who did a pretty good imitation of Marlon Brando. He told
me that the caller, spoofing the great actor, had criticized my diction on the outgoing message. I
called my machine and immediately realized that it was Marlon Brando. I called him back and he
asked me if I would help get his son Christian, who was charged with having shot and killed his
half sister’s lover, out of jail.

Christian Brando was originally charged with murder, after he shot his half sister Cheyenne’s
boyfriend. He claimed that Cheyenne had told him that the boyfriend, Dag Drollet, had physically
abused her. Christian apparently confronted Drollet. Christian claimed that they struggled over
his gun and that he never intended to kill htm. The prosecution claimed that it was a cold-
blooded, premeditated murder fueled by Christian’s drunken state.

Marlon Brando asked me to work with Robert Shapiro to get his son out of prison as soon as
possible. Brando blamed himself for his family problems and wanted to help as much as he could.
He said he heard that I “could perform miracles” and he wanted my input. I tried to disabuse him
of the notion that I could free his son immediately but promised to work as hard as I could with
Shapiro. Eventually a plea bargain was struck and Christian pleaded guilty to manslaughter. He
was released from prison after serving only five years, much to the chagrin of many in the public
and the media. The story did not, however, have a happy ending. Cheyenne committed suicide in
1995 at age 25 and Christian died of pneumonia in 2008 at age 49.

Marlon Brando, who stage and screen presence was electric, was kind of boring and predictable
when I met him. He had stereotypically “Hollywood” political views, conventional ideas and no
sense of humor. He was accustomed to “yes men” agreeing with his every idea and didn’t take
criticism or disagreement easily. He loved his children but didn’t seem to have any notion of how
to relate to them. All in all he struck me as a rather pathetic figure, totally at odds with his public
persona.

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024224.txt,"Global Utility White Paper CONFIDENTIAL

8 years tracks approximately 60 industry, commodity, and financial risk metrics and is a focus for the
Electron team. For example, consider oil price risk; although there may be no direct oil exposure in the
portfolio, there is indirect oil exposure if we were to be short Drax, a coal-fired generator that sells power
into the UK power market. In the UK, natural gas sets the marginal price of power, and in Europe, by
convention, natural gas is linked to the oil price; as such, a short position in Drax represents an effective
short position in oil. We track this risk along with numerous other factors that affect utilities, with the
purpose of minimizing risks for which we have no competitive advantage that would justify taking on the
exposure. We describe the risk model in more detail in the marketing book. In addition, we make the
Electron risk model available for all prospective investors’ due diligence.

Each position in the risk model contains a thesis write-up (to avoid thesis creep); upside, downside and
relative targets (for valuation discipline); and a time frame (to avoid collecting stocks). In addition to
tracking numerous industry, financial and macro risks, we also track alpha generation for all of our
regions, sectors, subsectors and sub-subsectors, which provides the added benefit of a granular window
on market flows. Finally, we incorporate an exponential function into the risk model that provides an
early alert and focuses our attention when something is not working. For example, we might be short
XYZ utility with 30% downside potential over 3 months, and put in a 15% loss limit. If in the first week XYZ
runs up 5%, it will trigger a “FAST” move alert in the risk model. If we cannot explain why the position is
moving against us, we will cover (i.e., when in doubt, get out). As mentioned, this is not a crowded space
(rarely do utility names appear on the Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund VIP list) and many names are low-beta,
low-volatility stocks. However, often when money is lost on the short side, it is the result of small daily
losses that would not be noticeable on any given day, but over even short periods of time can add up to
sizeable losses.

e Shorting Global Utilities

o Experience with Dividends and Investor Behavior

During the underperformance of the global utility industry over the last 4 years, Electron generated
very strong alpha on the short side. We spend almost twice as much time on the short side as we do
the long side; this is driven not only by the need for more short positions (given the asymmetry of
risk) but also because of the effect of utility dividends on investor behavior. For example, we might
be short a large cap utility with a 4% dividend yield that we believe to be a structural loser. The stock
might decline 25%, which would push the dividend yield up to 5.5%. Even though our valuation
models might tell us there is still another 10-15% valuation downside, we will tend to cover (unless
we believe the dividend is materially at risk), as the dividend yield will begin to provide support for
the stock. The precise level of the dividend yield at which we would cover is as much an art as a
science, as it is based on our experience in a variety of situations and our views on investor behavior
(particularly income funds) gained over many years of covering the sector. As such, you will find us
trading around our short positions more frequently than our long positions.

o Key to Electron’s Process to Identify Dividend Change Candidates

We also have developed a certain expertise in being early and correctly calling dividend changes — an
event that can have a dramatic impact on the performance of utilities given the make-up of the
investor base. In our long experience, utility CEO/CFOs will strongly defend the company’s dividend
(often borrowing or selling assets to fund it). As such, when they do finally cut the dividend, or talk
about the possibility, they often surprise the market.

It pays to be diligent in assessing the potential for a dividend cut, and to be early, since once
CEO/CFOs accept that their business model is deteriorating, they will quickly take action, especially if

their companies have less flexibility (particularly with respect to cutting capex and opex). Large-cap
utility managements desire strong credit ratings and are reluctant to risk an investment grade rating.

"
IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016990.txt,"mathematics, for example: Whitehead and Russell’s Principia Mathematica in 1910 was
the biggest showoff effort. There were previous attempts by Gottlob Frege and Giuseppe
Peano that were a little more modest in their presentation. Ultimately, they were wrong
in what they thought they should formalize: They thought they should formalize some
process of mathematical proof, which turns out not to be what most people care about.

With regard to a modern analog of the Turing Test, it’s an interesting question.
There’s still the conversational bot, which is Turing’s idea. That one hasn’t been solved
yet. It will be solved—the only question is, What is the application for which it is
solved? For along time I would ask, “Why should we care?”—because I thought the
principal application would be customer service, which wasn’t particularly high on my
list. But customer service, where you’ re trying to interface, 1s just where you need this
conversational language.

One big difference between Turing’s time and ours is the method of
communicating with computers. In his time, you typed something into the machine and it
typed back a response. In today’s world, it responds with a screen—as for instance, when
you want to buy a movie ticket. How is a transaction with a machine different from a
transaction with a human? The main answer ts that there’s a visual display. It asks you
something, and you press a button, and you can see the result immediately. For example,
in Wolfram|Alpha, when it’s used inside Sin, if there’s a short answer, Siri will tell you
the short answer. But what most people want is the visual display, showing the
infographic of this or that. This is a nonhuman form of communication that turns out to
be richer than the traditional spoken, or typed, human communication. In most human-
to-human communication, we’re stuck with pure language, whereas in computer-to-
human communication we have this much higher bandwidth channel—of visual
communication.

Many of the most powerful applications of the Turing Test fall away now that we
have this additional communication channel. For example, here’s one we’re pursuing
right now. It’s a bot that communicates about writing programs: You say, “I want to
write a program. I want it to do this.” The bot will say, “I’ve written this piece of
program. This is what it does. Is this what you want?” Blah-blah-blah. It’s a back-and-
forth bot. Devising such systems is an interesting problem, because they have to have a
model of a human if they’re trying to explain something to you. They have to know what
the human is confused about.

What has long been difficult for me to understand is, What’s the point of a
conventional Turing Test? What’s the motivation? As a toy, one could make a little chat
bot that people could chat with. That will be the next thing. The current round of deep
learning—particularly, recurrent neural networks—is making pretty good models of
human speech and human writing. We can type in, say, “How are you feeling today?”
and it knows most of the time what sort of response to give. But I want to figure out
whether I can automate responding to my email. I know the answer is “No.” A good
Turing Test, for me, will be when a bot can answer most of my email. That’s a tough
test. It would have to learn those answers from the humans the email is connected to. I
might be a little bit ahead of the game, because I’ve been collecting data on myself for
about twenty-five years. I have every piece of email for twenty-five years, every
keystroke for twenty. I should be able to train an avatar, an AI, that will do what I can
do—perhaps better than I could.

® In 2004, KinderCare contemplated an offering of income deposit securities. Costs here reflect the costs
incurred as a result of the contemplated offering.

® Result of the costs of operating duplicative infrastructure at KLC and KinderCare following the KinderCare
acquisition.

7 Management fee paid to affiliate entities.

Restructuring charges. Restructuring charges during the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, were
$29.4 million. Included in the $29.4 million of non-recurring integration costs were $11.0 million of
severance costs that resulted primarily from the closure of KLC’s former corporate offices at Golden, CO.
Additional restructuring costs in 2005 were the result of consulting, temporary contract-based labor and
other charges. Restructuring charges in 2004 were $5.1 million and were related to KLC’s acquisition of
AER in May 2003.

Parallel_Organization Costs. For much of 2005 KLC was burdened with the central operations and
infrastructure of both KinderCare and KLC. KLC has defined parallel organization costs as the cost of
maintaining these duplicative corporate functions during the overhead rationalization associated with the
KinderCare acquisition. KLC believes that approximately 70% of parallel organization costs are related to
salaries. Remaining parallel organization costs are related to upkeep, maintenance and utilities at
corporate facilities. During the first month of 2006 parallel organization costs had been reduced to
$174,042 (annualized run-rate of $2.1 million) compared to an estimated $23.3 million in 2005.

Parallel organization costs for the 2004 fiscal year are estimated based on an annualized run-rate based
on the costs incurred during the first month following the KinderCare acquisition. During that month
(January 2005), KLC incurred approximately $2.3 million of parallel organization costs ($28.1 million on
an annualized run-rate basis).

Interest. Interest expense in 2004 and 2005 is almost identical because both years are pro forma for the
financings associated with the Real Estate Transaction, which refinanced the indebtedness incurred to
finance the KinderCare acquisition. In 2005 pro forma interest expense of $89.9 million includes $5.1
million of non-cash interest expense. Actual interest expense during the 2005 fiscal year was $80.7
million which did not include $32.2 million related to the early extinguishment of debt.

If this is true then it is truly disgusting. That being said, after reading the comments section most of you need to
get off of your republican high horse. Many republican politricksters have also been embroiled in sex scandals,
some of them with minors, and some with underage boys. Now before the vains start popping out of your neck
causing you to respond to me in all caps calling some sort of commie democrat leftist, realize that I hate the
democrats just as much as IJ hate the republicans. In fact let’s just call them the demublicans or the republicrats,
whatever your pleasure. Most of you need to realize it’s not about the ideology of one party or the other, it’s
about the ideology of power. These politricksters, all of them more stinking rich than average Joe American, get
in the insulated world of political power and get a sense of invincibility and entitlement. They don’t care about
you or me, not a single one of them. But, as long as we keep seeing each other as the enemy rather than realize
that they are the real enemy bent on destroying this country and the world then we, our children, and our
grandchildren are doomed.

Below is a link to federal sex scandals perpetrated by republicrats and demublicans alike. Keep in mind that this
list does not include local and state level scandals.

What changed? In Waterstones one day I found myself in the Israel and Palestine section.
To this day I don't know why I actually pulled it off the shelf, but I picked up a copy of
Alan Dershowitz's The Case for Israel.

In my world view the Jews and the Americans controlled the media, so after a brief look at
the back, I scoffed thinking vile Zionist propaganda.

But I decided to buy it, eagerly awaiting the chance to deconstruct it so I could show why
Israel had no case and claim my findings as a personal victory for the Palestinian cause.
As I read Dershowitz's systematic deconstruction of the lies I had been told, I felt a real
crisis of conscience. I couldn't disprove his arguments or find facts to respond to them
with. I didn't know what to believe. I'd blindly followed for so long, yet here I was
questioning whether I had been wrong?

I decided to visit Israel to find the truth. I was confronted by synagogues, mosques and
churches, by Jews and Arabs living together, by minorities playing huge parts in all areas
of Israeli life, from the military to the judiciary. It was shocking and eye-opening. This
wasn't the evil Zionist Israel that I had been told about.

After much soul searching, I knew what I had once believed was wrong. I had to stand
with Israel, with this tiny nation, free, democratic, making huge strides in medicine,
research and development, yet the victim of the same lies and hatred that nearly consumed
me.

Not all people were so positively influenced, a woman in England asked the manager of a large
book store for a copy of Zhe Case For Israel. He responded, “there is no case for Israel.”

I have devoted much of my 7 decade to the defense of Israel (while continuing to criticize many
of its policies, especially regarding settlements.) This has earned me the title of “the Jewish
State’s lead attorney in the court of public opinion” and “America’s most public Jewish defender.”
It has also earned me the title of “Ziofascist,” “Jewish Nazi,” “tool of the Likud,” and “Israel
Firster.”

It is these latter titles that have brought about the most recent change in my life during my 8
decade. Until recently, I was always known as a liberal Democrat aligned politically with the likes
of Senator Ted Kennedy, President Bill Clinton, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Senator
Hubert Humphrey, Justices Arthur Goldberg and William Brennan, the Reverend Martin Luther
King, and Judge David Bazelon. The organization with which I have been most closely
associated has been the American Civil Liberties Union, on whose national and local boards I
have served. The causes with which I have been most often associated were freedom of speech;
opposition to the death penalty; due process for criminal suspects and defendants; the separation
of church and state; racial, gender, religious, wealth and sexual orientation equality; and political
accountability . Indeed, when I have been considered for judgeships and other government
positions requiring Senate confirmation, I was generally regarded as “too liberal” to be confirmed.

government issued a formal protest and advised Turks against travel
to Syria, a reversal of its proud open-borders policy.

Turkey also appears motivated by a desire to keep ahead of evolving
Arab opinion. It can comfortably be said, in light of recent
developments, that the countdown to the end of Syria's Assad regime
has begun, said Today's Zaman columnist Biilent Kenes, reflecting
official opinion.

With senior Saudi officials and King Abdullah of Jordan openly
backing the revolt, and the violence escalating, Erdogan and his
foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, who have long harboured
regional leadership ambitions, seem to be positioning themselves for
a post-Assad future.

In this push towards the Syrian endgame they plainly have the
enthusiastic backing of the US, for whom they are effectively acting
as a local proxy in opposition to external actors such as the pro-
regime Russia. Given Erdogan's sharp differences with Washington
over Israel-Palestine and the Iraq war, this coincidence of view is not
lacking in irony. We very much welcome the strong stance that
Turkey has taken and believe it sends a critical message to President
Assad that ... he should step down, said Ben Rhodes, Barack
Obama's deputy national security adviser.

In a series of statements, Davutoglu has insisted it is no longer
possible to trust the Syrian government. Adding provocation to
insult, he underscored Ankara's support for the protesters and
specifically for the Syrian National Council, an opposition umbrella
group based in Turkey that is seeking recognition from Ankara. We
will continue to take our place at the side of the Syrian people's
rightful struggle, Davutoglu said.

As bilateral tensions rise, suggestions that Turkey may physically
intervene in northern Syria to create a safe haven for civilians
displaced by the violence are likely to resurface. Several thousand

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016984.txt,"Over nearly four decades, Stephen Wolfram has been a pioneer in the development and
application of computational thinking and responsible for many innovations in science,
technology and business.

His 1982 paper “Cellular Automata as Simple Self-Organizing Systems,” written
at the age of twenty-three, was the first of numerous significant scientific contributions
aimed at understanding the origins of complexity in nature.

It was around this time that Stephen briefly came into my life. I had established
The Reality Club, an informal gathering of intellectuals who met in New York City to
present their work before peers in other disciplines. (Note: In 1996, The Reality Club
went online as Edge.org). Our first speaker? Stephen Wolfram, a “wunderkind” who
had arrived in Princeton at the Institute for Advanced Study. I distinctly recall his
focused manner as he sat down on a couch in my living room and spoke uninterrupted for
about an hour before the assembled group.

Since that time, Stephen has become intent making the world’s knowledge easily
computable and accessible. His program Mathematica is the definitive system for
modern technical computing. Wolfram|Alpha computes expert-level answers using AI
technology. He considers his Wolfram Language to be the first true computational
communication language for humans and AIs.

I caught up with him again four years ago, when we arranged to meet in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, for a freewheeling conversation about Al. Stephen walked
in, said hello, sat down, and, looking at the video camera set up to record the
conversation for Edge, began to talk and didn’t stop for two and a half hours.

The essay that follows is an edited version of that session, which was a Wolfram
master class of sorts and is an appropriate way to end this volume—just as Stephen’s
Reality Club talk in the ’80s was a great way to initiate the ongoing intellectual
enterprise whose result is the rich community of thinkers presenting their work to one
another and to the public in this book.

IMAGES-012-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033324.txt,"However, the ways in which sociopaths differ from psychopaths is key to
understanding their evolutionary utility. For example, psychopaths are more likely
than the general public to be violent and to end up incarcerated. Narcissistic
sociopaths, on the other hand, are usually nonviolent and happy to work within a
system of laws and norms, insofar as it suits their goals, because, while they do not
hesitate to harm others, it isn’t a specific aim. Instead, they are highly motivated
toward the accumulation of riches and influence; whereas psychopaths are often
motivated toward sadistic self-gratification and generally do not seek positions of
power and wealth per se. (There is some crossover between these phenotypes and
sociopaths who do find gratification in hurting others are labeled malignant
sociopaths.) Finally, narcissistic sociopaths always seek reproductive success
through procreation and aggressive nepotism, which is usually accompanied by
extreme in-group identification, e.g. racism, xenophobia, and nationalism, while
psychopaths show no allegiance to family, community, or country.

Therefore, the phenotype of the narcissistic sociopath is not a bizarre combination
of traits, but rather a set of highly attuned social skills and behaviors aimed at
increasing long-term biological fitness through wealth, status, power, and the future
success of progeny. In order words, sociopaths are highly adapted. The evolutionary
puzzle is not found in the phenotype itself but rather in the interaction of sociopaths
with the society in which they exist. Social groups can detect dishonest and
manipulative behaviors and act to punish the actors in order to either correct the
antisocial behavior or remove them from the group. Dozens of mammal species
have shown this very sophisticated and elastic social behavior, but humans and our
close relatives are especially apt at detecting and punishing cheaters, freeloaders,
and liars.

This sets up both a short-term conflict and long-term evolutionary battle between
manipulative narcissistic sociopaths and the rest of society, that is, those who do not
wish to be manipulated. Most individuals in a society share a vested interest in
maintaining fairness and social order. The equilibrium point is reached through a
concept called frequency-dependent selection, the essence of which is that
phenotypes can sometimes have distinct advantages precisely because they are rare.
Under this paradigm, the infrequency of sociopaths in a population is essential to
their success.

Current estimates place the prevalence of narcissistic sociopathy at 1-2% and
scholars have held that this rate appears stable across societies and over recorded
history (insofar as such a phenotype and its frequency can be inferred from
historical sources). This makes sociopathy a candidate phenotype for frequency-
dependent selection, especially given how successful they often are. The rarity of
narcissistic sociopaths in the population, along with their considerable skill in
hiding their true motivations, makes them very difficult to detect. If they were more
numerous, however, members of society would become familiar with this particular
pattern of social deviance and quickly learn to neutralize it. Furthermore, when
narcissists encounter one another, while they may be willing to cooperate with each

These documents also revealed that Stone had paid Anatoly Kucher-
ena, Snowden’s legal representative in Moscow, $1 million, sup-
posedly for the rights to his novel, Time of the Octopus. Even by
Hollywood standards, $1 million was an extraordinary sum to pay
for a yet-to-be-published work of Russian fiction, and it was espe-
cially striking because Stone was making a fact-based movie using
the actual names of the characters, and he had already bought the
rights to The Snowden Files.

“Is your script based on Kucherena’s Time of the Octopus?” I
asked.

“No,” Stone replied. “I haven’t used it.”

He said that the payment was for what he termed “total access.”
He explained that Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, the pro-
ducers of the James Bond franchise, had optioned Greenwald’s book
No Place to Hide to make into a movie about Snowden for Sony.
Stone said that the million-dollar deal with Kucherena effectively
guaranteed that any competing project would not have access to
Snowden. Sony consequently put the competing film on hold.

© Lawyers often negotiate deals on behalf of a client, but blocking a ©
competing film requires considerably more influence with the pow-
ers that be in Russia. Kucherena, though, was no ordinary lawyer.
Among other influential positions, I noted earlier, he was on the pub-
lic board of the Russian federal security bureau, which had assumed
the domestic operations of the defunct KGB in April 1995. In light
of such connections, Stone said Kucherena might be acting as an
intermediary for other parties who controlled access to Snowden in
Russia. In any case, his concern was making a movie, and Kucherena
delivered the exclusive access to Snowden.

Aside from being a skilled director, Stone is a shrewd producer
who knows how to close a deal. He assessed, correctly as it turned
out, that his project coupled with the payment to Kucherena would
effectively block Sony’s competing project. Where the money went
was far less clear.

Toward the end of our dinner, Stone told me that he did not know
I was writing a book about Snowden until a few weeks earlier. He
learned of my book from Snowden himself. He said Snowden had

to extend rights before indictment.'** Thus, if anything, the legislative
history does not support OLC’s conclusion—it contradicts it.'*°

OLC should have had no doubt as to the intent of Senator Kyl and his
cosponsors at the time of the Act’s passage. Shortly after shepherding the
CVRA through the Congress, Senator Kyl cowrote a law review article
about the Act.!*° In that article, he directly indicated that the CVRA applies
before charges are filed. Senator Kyl and his coauthors wrote:

While most of the rights guaranteed by the CVRA apply in the context of legal
proceedings following arrest and charging, other important rights are triggered by the
harm inflicted by the crime itself. For example, the right to be treated with fairness,
the right to be reasonably protected from the accused (who may qualify as the accused
before his arrest), and the right to be treated with respect for the victim’s dignity and
privacy each may arise without regard to the existence of legal proceedings. '5”

Remarkably, OLC cited Senator Kyl’s law review article (in a footnote), but
then concluded without explanation that the CVRA cosponsor’s views were
for some reason different than Congress’s.'**

OLC also appears to acknowledge that its interpretation of the CVRA
could well contradict what it describes as prosecutorial “good practice.”'*?
OLC noted that some Justice Department components (for example, the
Environmental and Natural Resources Division) had advocated that the
right to confer should apply during pre-charging plea discussions.'*? OLC
then acknowledged that limiting the right to confer until after formal
charging could “reduce the impact of a victim’s participation in subsequent
court proceedings.”'*! OLC attempted to dodge this problem by explaining:
“The question before us, though, is not whether it would be advisable as a
matter of good practice .. . for Government attorneys to confer with victims
pre-charge when appropriate... .”'*” OLC then explained that even under
its narrow interpretation of the statute, “the CVRA would still ensure that

Separately, American intelligence agencies had intercepted communications of
Russian officials, some of them within the Kremlin, discussing contacts with Trump
associates.

The story went on:

Mr. Trump has denied that his campaign had any contact with Russian officials, and
at one point he openly suggested that American spy agencies had cooked up
intelligence suggesting that the Russian government had tried to meddle in the
presidential election. Mr. Trump has accused the Obama administration of hyping
the Russia story line as a way to discredit his new administration.

And then the real point:

At the Obama White House, Mr. Trump’s statements stoked fears among some that
intelligence could be covered up or destroyed—or its sources exposed—once power
changed hands. What followed was a push to preserve the intelligence that
underscored the deep anxiety with which the White House and American
intelligence agencies had come to view the threat from Moscow.

Here was more confirmation of a central Trump thesis: The previous administration, its
own candidate defeated, was not just disregarding the democratic custom of smoothing the
way for the winner of the election; rather, in the Trump White House view, Obama’s
people had plotted with the intelligence community to put land mines in the new
administration’s way. Secret intelligence was, the story suggested, being widely
distributed across intelligence agencies so as to make it easier to leak, and at the same time
to protect the leakers. This intelligence, it was rumored, consisted of spreadsheets kept by
Susan Rice that listed the Trump team’s Russian contacts; borrowing a technique from
WikiLeaks, the documents were secreted on a dozen servers in different places. Before
this broad distribution, when the information was held tightly, it would have been easy to
identify the small pool of leakers. But the Obama administration had significantly
expanded that pool.

So this was good news, right? Wasn’t this proof, the president asked, that Obama and
his people were out to get him? The 7imes story was a leak about a plan to leak—and it
provided clear evidence of the deep state.

Hope Hicks, as always, supported Trump’s view. The crime was leaking and the culprit
was the Obama administration. The Justice Department, the president was confident, was
now going to investigate the former president and his people. Finally.

OOK Ok

Hope Hicks also brought to the president a big piece in the New Yorker. The magazine had
just published an article by three authors—Evan Osnos, David Remnick, and Joshua Yaffa

number generator really works.
There should be no way to predict
the resulting number as both
of you are affected by quantum
randomness and, provided you
wait a little before shouting stop,
any social stereotyping should
be overcome. If you want to be
scientific, remember the random
number you started with and the
length of time before your friend
shouted stop. There should be an
improvement in randomness with
the amount of time they wait.

In the absence of human

A computer does not acquire free will just through the injection of
randomness. You could simply put an intercept on the link from the lava

Dozens of women alleged that Epstein molested and raped them when they were underaged using a

sophisticated human trafficking network. A civil trial is scheduled to begin on Tuesday in Palm Beach

County that may finally let these women tell their stories in court.

Behind the scenes: While he was allegedly raping teenage girls, Epstein cultivated cozy relationships

with America's elites.

e Bill Clinton flew on Epstein's plane, nicknamed the Lolita Express, numerous times, according to

flight logs.

e And Donald Trump, ina profile with New York magazine written several years before the police

wom

caught up with Epstein, praised his friend as a terrific guy.” It is even said that he likes beautiful

women as much as I do, Trump said of Epstein, and many of them are on the younger side.
¢ Dershowitz was also friendly with Epstein before the broader public knew he was a pedophile.

Dershowitz confirmed to me that he received a massage at Epstein's Palm Beach home, adding

that the woman who provided it was of legal age.

e What happened was I, um, he lent us, this was well before any of this thing came out, he lent us
his house once. And I was there, my grandchildren were there, my daughter was there, and we all

got massages.”

e And, um, it was therapeutic. I had a therapeutic massage with an old old Russian, but I never
never ... and that was part of when we had his house for about a week during I think it was

Christmas vacation.

e Believe me, if I had known that anything improper had ever taken place in that house, I never
would have allowed my children, my grandchildren, my wife, my daughter-in-law, my son, to have
spent time there. I can tell you categorically there were no inappropriate pictures, no

inappropriate anythings. It was like any other house.

One of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Roberts, has claimed Dershowitz had sex with her when she was

underage. Dershowitz has denied the allegation and told the Miami Herald the story was 100 percent

flatly categorically made-up so she could get money.”

Of course, the fact that they were necking and holding hands doesn't preclude the possibility that
Desiree may have said no when it came to intercourse. Nor does it mean that a woman who
engages in sexual foreplay may not refuse further sex at any point. Of course she may, and if the
man then forces her to have sex without her consent, it is rape. But the testimony of these
eyewitnesses shows three important facts: the first is that Washington was lying when she denied
necking with Tyson; the second is that Tyson was telling the truth when he testified that they were
necking; and third, that just moments before the hotel door closed behind them, Washington was
involved in sexual foreplay with Tyson.

Despite the importance of this eyewitness testimony by three disinterested witnesses in an
otherwise uncorroborated she-said, he said credibility contest, the trial judge adamantly refused
to allow the jury to hear the evidence of the three eyewitnesses. She ruled that the
prosecution—which admitted that the testimony was pivotal --would have been “prejudiced” by
its late disclosure. This was absurd because the three witnesses had come forward before the
close of the prosecutor's case—after learning that Desiree Washington had denied necking with
Tyson—and well before the defense case even began. There was plenty of time for the large team
of prosecutors to prepare to cross examine them, and if they needed more time, the judge could
have briefly recessed the trial. In any event, surprise defense witnesses are common in criminal
trials, and the Bill of Rights explicitly guarantees a criminal defendant the right to call “witnesses
in his favor.” Despite this the judge denied Tyson the right to call these three pivotal witnesses.
So much for the “search for truth.”

In all my years of practice and teaching criminal law, I had never heard of a case in which a judge
had refused to allow a criminal defendant the right to call eye witnesses who could help establish
his innocence. The law, including the law of Indiana, clearly supported Tyson’s right to do so.

It should come as no surprise, however, that this particular trial judge made such a bizarre and
unprecedented ruling to exclude such relevant and exculpatory evidence. The trial judge, Patricia
Gifford, who used to be a full time professional rape prosecutor, had prosecuted more than 50
rape cases. She expressed extremely strong feeling about rape, especially what has come to be
called “date rape.” Indeed, she lectured the lawyers against even using the term date rape in her
courtroom and refused to give the traditional date rape instruction, which requires acquittal if the
jury concludes that the defendant reasonably believed the woman consented, even if she did not
intend to consent.

After reading the transcript, it became clear to me that Patricia Gifford did not see her role in rape
cases as being a neutral judge, but rather as another prosecutor, with a stake in the outcome. She
wanted to see the most famous “rapist” in Indiana history convicted and put away. Judge Gifford
made virtually every important ruling in the prosecutor’s favor, including the exclusion of those
three “pivotal” witnesses who would have won the case for Tyson. She also excluded
evidence—under the rape shield law—that, would have proved that Desiree Washington had a
strong motive to frame Mike Tyson for rape. (More on this soon.)

fighter jets. Other, much larger nations had endured months, even years, of hell
before prevailing in such circumstances: the Soviet Union, for instance, with its
huge strategic depth, or France, rescued by its American-led allies, during
World War Two.

But any pride in having prevailed was outweighed by simple relief Israel had
survived. Even that was nothing compared to the sadness felt over friends lost,
and the resentment and sense of betrayal toward the generals and political
leaders who had failed to prepare the country for the surprise attacks, or the
initial confusion and dissension in some of our commanders’ response to the
early setbacks on the ground. Dozens of meetings were held in military units
after the war to talk about what had gone wrong. I was not the only young
officer to notice that the higher up the command chain they went, the more
unedifying they became. After we’d heard one too many senior officer fine-
tuning his account with each retelling, minimizing his share for the huge losses,
a new phrase entered Israeli army slang. Sipurei kravot — “battle stories” — were
the words usually used to describe a normal debriefing process. That expression
was now amended, to shipurei kravot. Battle improvements.

I was assigned to convert my makeshift force into a regular armored training
unit: Battalion 532, and that slightly delayed my reunion with Nava and Mikhal.
But in their absence, I found us a larger apartment in the Tel Aviv suburb of
Ramat Hasharon. Nava and I agreed that at the first opportunity, I’d return to
California and we’d fly back together. I went at the end of the year. We bought
a refrigerator and a washing machine for the new flat — better models, and
cheaper, than those available in Israel — and came home. Those few December
days in Palo Alto were a jumble of emotions. Happiness, at being back together.
But also a sobering sense, now that I was outside Israel for the first time since
the war, of the enormity of the threat we’d faced and the frustration and fear
Nava must have felt as we’d fought to defeat it. The year-end news
retrospectives we watched on American TV were full of film clips from the first
hours of the war, when it looked very possible we would lose. I remember being
struck by the thought that, if we had lost, if Israel had ceased to exist,
ceremonies of memorial and mourning would have been held across America,
probably in Stanford. But that once the shock and sadness had passed, Israel’s
disappearance would not have impinged on a single NFL Sunday, or delayed a
single family shopping visit to J. C. Penny.

tion treaties with the United States. Yet, instead, he flew to Hong
Kong, which had an extradition agreement that had been enforced
throughout the past decade with Hong Kong courts ordering the
arrest of almost every fugitive charged by U.S. authorities. He could
expect that when the United States filed a criminal complaint, Hong
Kong authorities would seize him and the alleged stolen property of
the U.S. government in his possession. Even if he were released on
bail and successfully defeated extradition in a Hong Kong court, the
Hong Kong authorities would almost certainly retain all the NSA
and GCHQ files he had gone to such lengths to steal.

His reason, as he told Greenwald, was that China could provide
him with physical protection from any countermeasures by U.S.
intelligence agencies such as “American agents... breaking down
the door” of the hotel room and seizing him. China also had sway
over Hong Kong’s security activities.

Hong Kong was therefore merely a protected stopover en route to
his next destination. If he had gone directly to Moscow and provided
the same journalists with the same documents at a press conference

© in Moscow, his status as a whistle-blower might have been viewed ©
with less sympathy in the media. Even The Guardian, for example,
might have been reluctant to publish a Moscow-based story reveal-
ing British and American communications intelligence secrets.

The Third Decision

The third choice Snowden made, and the choice that most effectively
defined him to the public, was to reveal himself as the man behind
the leak in a video in Hong Kong. He not only identified himself as
the person who stole the government documents published by The
Guardian and The Washington Post but also incriminated himself
further on camera by allowing Poitras to film him actually disclosing
the NSA’s secret operations to Greenwald. By disclosing classified
data to Greenwald, an unauthorized person, he intentionally burned
his bridges.

What makes this choice intriguing is that there was no evident

physiological domain, but are often made vaguely equivalent on the basis of their

lexical similarity.

An experimentally meaningful relationship between fractal statistics (hazard),
dynamical fractals (dimension) and fractal geometries (form), has to be proven ona
case by case basis and not assumed from their common designation. Among the
informal attempts to do this have been those that involve the branching pattern of
nerves and the associated reductions in their diameter-dependent characteristic
conduction velocities yielding a multiplicity of “arrival times.” There is, however, a
more central idea common to these concatenated meanings of fractal: the
statistical, dynamical and geometric expressions of “scaling,” a word which is not
mentioned in Mandelbrot’s book titles. The cluster of theories, theorems and
methods associated with the idea of scaling (and renormalization) have led to Nobel
Prizes for Flory (1971), Wilson (1975) and de Gennes (1979) and the (equivalent
mathematical) Field’s Medal for McMullen (1994). There is speculation that the last
two awards were supported by the inspiration and interest given their research by

Mandelbrot’s intuitions and books.

Scaling laws take the place of (unknown causal) physical laws by indicating
the proportion by which observables of a system can be changed in relationship to
each other such that some statement about them, “this varies with that,” still holds.
In a cross species comparison, as the average weight of a mammalian body, called
lb, increases, the skeletal weight, called w, increases at an exponentially greater
rate: w goes like Ib'°® where Ib'° would indicate that they grew across species at
the same rate. Plotting log (Ib) on the x axis and log (w) on the y axis in a log-log
plot results in a straignt line with a slope that indicates the power law scaling
relationship between body weight and skeletal weight across mammals. The slope
of the scaling exponent of 1.08 is a little over 45 = 1. In contrast, the metabolic rate,

0.75

r, goes like (Ib)°”, r ~ (Ib)°”°. Larger animals (relative to their weight) have lower

basal metabolic rates (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1984). We don’t completely know the chain

of intervening mechanisms that relate these variables to each other but we do know

Dear Jeffrey, 
May I drop by before the New Year (perhaps on the 9th, or on the 17th or 18th?) to get your advice 
about my renewal of the Templeton campaign, and also my needs in the coming year for Poetry in 
America? Below is the letter I'm sending out to my friends and supporters, and at the bottom a 
message just for you.... 
-Lisa 
That you are receiving this letter means that you are among a special community of friends whose 
support— financial, moral, intellectual, logistical— has allowed my initiative, Poetry in America, to 
realize what seemed, a year ago, almost certainly too ambitious a vision. That vision was to 
produce the highest quality educational video on American poetry, creating a body of 
humanities content capable of reaching a broad community of learners: formal and informal, 
online and residential, young and old, American and international. And it was to 
begin— rapidly— to disseminate and distribute our work. 
Whether you donated to Poetry in America through Filmmaker's Collaborative (our 501c3 fiscal 
sponsor), through Harvard, or through WGBH; whether you appeared on camera or talked an 
elusive friend into appearing on camera to discuss a poem; whether you lent us your film crew, or 
provided overnight use of your hotel suite or apartment or of your whole skyscraper; whether you 
highlighted our work on your stage, or talked your colleagues into becoming corporate sponsors; 
whether you flew to Boston to install state-of-the-art editing and video storage equipment, or asked 
your children's school to let us film there; whether you encouraged your family foundation to take an 
interest in the project, or gave us a lesson in IP, in licensing, in the rudiments of finance, or of 
distribution; whether you praised, or gave timely, much-needed criticism— you enabled what we 
have done. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029242 
Here's what we have to report, and to show, a year later, thanks to your help. Links offer sneak 
peeks of works -in-progress across the full portfolio of Poetry in America projects. 
• The first eight-episode season of the public television series Poetry in America (a co-
production between WGBH, Emmy Award-winning filmmaker David Grubin, and my own new 
production company, Verse Video), is now fully funded and in production, with episodes featuring  
Bill Clinton, Herbie Hancock and Sonia Sanchez on Langston Hughes, Frank Gehry on Carl 
Sandburg, Katie Couric on Elizabeth Bishop, Nas on Whitman, and many more scheduled for 
nationwide launch in 2017. 
• Poetry in America's many initiatives to reach Middle and High School teachers and their 
students are taking root. Our first online course for Middle and High School Teachers, Poetry of 
the City, will launch this Spring with the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Companion 
materials to this course will be made available for free on PBS LearningMedia. This course is 
designed to meet the needs of English Language Arts and Social Studies teachers in the US and 
internationally. 
• We are eager to begin production of The Poetry of Earth, Sea, and Sky. Designed, too, for 
Middle and High School teachers, The Poetry of Earth, Sea, and Sky will draw English Language 
Arts instruction into dialogue with science, and will include extraordinary footage of the natural  
world, conversations with poets, scholars, and scientists as well as footage shot in class and in the 
field with great teachers. 
• A recent partnership with Greenwich Country Day School and the Success Academy Network 
of charter schools will provide a base for the production of a new collection of classroom-ready 
educational material on The Poetry of Art Sport, and Play. This collection will include discussions 
on poems filmed everywhere from sports fields to Broadway theaters, and will feature dancers, 
athletes, fashion designers, and more. 
• With a growing archive of footage capturing teachers and students reading American poems, 
we are eager to expand our reach and move into America's schools, disseminating, testing, 
and learning from teachers and students using our materials. We hope to be able to begin work 
evaluating the impact of poetry on literacy levels and character development and, eventually, to 
produce a full suite of materials that foster character development along with intellectual growth. 
Working closely with such partners as The Nantucket Project, Nautilus Magazine, The Aspen Ideas 
Festival, and The Big Think, and, of course, HarvardX, Harvard's provider of free open online 
courses, we are continuing to create rich educational media on poetry for adult learners and 
lifelong learners. These materials include short form videos such as this one on Robert Pinsky's  
Shirt (as featured in The New Yorker), and, this spring, the sixth module of the free seven-part 
Poetry in America MOOC, which has registrants in over 150 countries. 
Growing rapidly, and outpacing our current staff and infrastructure, Poetry in America has a 
fundraising goal this year of 2.5 million dollars to fund its expanding group of projects. We've taken 
a big step, hiring the design agency Threespot to help us develop our web presence. Our 
website— to launch early 2016— will eventually serve as an online hub for our TV show and 
educational projects. We hope you'll join us then for a virtual launch! 
Finally, Jeffrey, you have been such a wonderful supporter of my Poetry in America project. The 
Leon Black gift changed everything for me last year. It paid salaries for staff I desperately needed to 
complete projects (detail below), but first and foremost, it gave me leverage, enabling me to set 
down a solid Harvard base for my activities by giving the school something to point to: this public 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029243 
humanities project among the list of projects the Dean supports. The money did it: as soon as they 
heard about the gift, they took my project more seriously. Because of that gift, the Faculty of Arts 
and Sciences, which is space-stingy, found and rewired a studio space for me to house my video 
production operation and team. That gift woke up the Deans to the importance of Harvard's role in 
producing the highest quality humanities content for the WORLD, and not just for Harvard students. 
My main employee has half of her salary paid with these funds, and the foundation of our collection 
for PBS LeamingMedia is being made with this support. This gift represented one of the most 
consequential shifts of the last year, allowing me create content and launch projects this year that 
make future projects that much more likely. If I can keep this base sturdy at Harvard, refilling these 
coffers, I will be that much more able to keep working. 
I am also so grateful for the help you gave me in defining my project for Templeton, and, what help 
you have offered to give in bringing them around. I have, since Templeton turned me down, gotten 
funding to produce video on two of the poems I'd proposed to Templeton and to create, and test, 
that video in schools as I proposed. One of my partners in that project is Success Academy, where I 
could also expand my work with Templeton. And there are still other poems that may satisfy their 
character criteria more fully, including the third of the poems I'd originally proposed and that Joe 
Biden had agreed to discuss with me (on parenthood and humility). At this point, I'm gaining the 
platform and the name recognition to be an effective spokesperson for the foundation on building 
literacy and character in the schools. 
It really means a lot to me, all financial help aside, Jeffrey, that you are rooting for me and thinking 
about me. You push back a lot (as Larry does), and it's always annoying but I always learn. 
With abundant gratitude, 
Lisa

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024218.txt,"Global Utility White Paper CONFIDENTIAL

MSCI world utility vs MSCI world index

_———=

Source: Bloomberg

Of course, not all investors sold utilities - some were astute buyers. Warren Buffett (at the time,
thought to be a bit out of touch with the new economy) acquired $12 billion worth of utility assets
between 1999 and 2002, namely MidAmerican ($9 billion), Kern River Gas Transmission (S960 million)
and Northern Natural Gas ($1.9 billion).

Following the dotcom bust (Mar 00-Sep 01), global utilities staged a sharp catch-up rally over a 1.5-
year period, generating +33% outperformance (-5% absolute). During this period, US utilities (which
previously were the worst-performing region for utilities during the run-up) outperformed +68%
(+37% absolute). But the averages conceal some outsized moves in utility stocks as investors
returned to the sector en masse. Early investors realized enormous absolute returns on low-beta US
utility stocks (e.g. SO +114%, ETR +114%, FE +99%, AEP +91%, PEG +78%) while the S&P sank -31%.
Still, investors were discriminating as several stocks (e.g., CVA -45%, AES -34%, EIX -19%, PCG -16%,
NU -3%) suffered absolute declines.

In Europe, the UK water utility stocks (among the lowest-beta/volatility stocks in the global sector)
were wholly ignored during the dotcom rally despite their improving fundamentals. Following the
dotcom bust (Mar 00-Sep 01) they also staged a fierce outperformance rally, and early fundamental
investors realized very attractive absolute returns (e.g. Pennon +80%, Severn Trent +52% and United
Utilities +21%), and enormous outperformance of the broader market (FTSE 100 Index -33%). This is
all the more impressive when you consider that these water utility stocks have betas of
approximately .43, less than half that of the broad market.

Again, fundamental investors were discerning as several European utilities experienced absolute
declined during this same period (e.g., EDP -31%, Enel -30%, Endesa -20%, Centrica -19%).

o Japan Rallies

Japan offers insights into potential utility outperformance during periods of private sector
deleveraging similar to what developed markets have experienced since the financial crisis.

Richard Koo, Chief Economist of the Nomura Research Institute, cites two major policy errors that
extended Japan’s long balance sheet recession: increased taxes in 1997 and expenditure cuts in 2001.
Both policy errors were preceded by a long or sharp period of utility underperformance relative to

lines do not mention convicted sex offender or pedophile. Instead, Philanthrophic work, Epstein Foundation,
Promotion of Scientists. We have stopped the hacking on your wiki site, and that was a major effor. Your wiki
entry now is pretty tame, and bad stuff has been muted, bowlerized, and pused to the bottom. Careful editing
and wording has muted the effect immensely. We hacked the site to replace the mug shot and caption, and now
has an entirely different photo and caption. This was a big success.

We pushed the Edge all the way up to the front page, where it was previously buried on page 5 of google
search.

We have promoted the other jeffrey epsteins, and other pages are also filled with your material.

And, while the sites are up, and in the direction we hoped, they are still new, and subject to volitility,
especially if new original content is not added on a minimum of a weekly basis. I have been forbideen to add
new content to the philanthrophic site as well as the science site, and therefore, as a result our rating slipped
down (still on the first page, but would have liked them (and some of the articles to been able to push
Huffington off page). We also helped with you images, and the first images that come of you on a google
search are not of your mug shot, etc.

Your daily beast foe is still at it, and trying to promote her sites against you in the same way that we try to
depromote you.

As far as this site is concerned, and the continuation of this, I do not know what you wish to do. Clearly, you
have no interest in my continuing. And, I am not sure if you want to continue the project at all. If the latter, and
you stop, eventually it will just go into the way of entropy, and it will return to the old form. The major work
has been done, but it needs to be maintained. For it to get better results, it needs to have constant input and
supervision, and that means generating proper content, not just editing and grammatical fixes. Writers need to
know what to write. THe philanthrophy site is at the bottom of the page precisely because you have not
allowed us to add any content to it, and as a result it suffers.

You paid Mike $2500, which he applied for the purchasing of his replacement servers, but his fee of $7500
balance is now due if you want to continue. Please let me know what you want to do. I need to inform him, and
if you are not going to use him, he needs to take on his other clients and devote his time there.

This needs to be contrasted with what we started with, which was a search on your name, which had nine/10
very toxic prominent stories, and toxic Wiki article and headline.

Jeffrey, 
Need your advice. 
My finance minister is telling me that he has an anonymous funds manager who is willing to deposit 4 billion 
dollars in Maldives and that they are willing to lend a percentage of that in exchange for government 
promissory notes. The 4 billion would be deposited in the Central Bank. But they want us to set up a special 
purpose vehicle, a construction company fully owned by the government to receive the loan. Such a company 
can only be set up under a presidential decree. 
I am also told that the funds manager would be charging Maldives upfront a certain percentage of the amount 
lent. 
I don't feel I have enough information on this. I don't know who is this funds manager. They always want the 
finance minister to meet them in Bangkok or some place outside. Why would anyone want to deposit such a 
large amount here when we don't have a credit rating and public debt is so high. I feel very uncomfortable about 
this. 
What do you think I should do. I am very uncomfortable. In addition to the finance minister, a leading politician 
and leader of the coalition parliamentary group is behind it. He could be my leading contender for presidency. 
Does this sound all ridiculous to you. I have a strange feeling about this whole thing.

Getting the right people to head various aspects on the campaign is difficult here but we should be able to 
pull the team together shortly. 
We will need some more help from Ian and Rory because we are still weak on international 
communication. Some old negative stuff keeps coming up in the Guardian newspaper in England. But most 
of the international media is not paying much attention to Maldives right now. 
I have asked Rory to help find a full time communications guy to stay here for about a year to work with 
me. He doesn't have to be an expert, just a good graduate student would do. Some really positive stuff is 
also happening now and we need the world to know about them. 
World Energy Forum and CGI guys are here. I am meeting Clinton people in a few minutes. 
I have some funding now but will ask all friends to help raise more later when things start happening in full

Hope all is well and look forward to seeing you here in the not too distant future.

Having constructed 7x, we can then say that

Definition 8 The inferred pragmatic general intelligence (relative to v and y) of a naturalistic
agent X defined relative to an environment ys, is defined as the pragmatic general intelligence
of the model rx of X produced by the agent 6 € A with maximal inference ability relative to js
(and in the case of a tte, the first of these in the ordering defined over A). The inferred efficient
pragmatic general intelligence of X relative to ys is defined similarly.

This provides a precise characterization of the pragmatic and efficient pragmatic intelligence
of real-world systems, based on their observed behaviors. It’s a bit messy; but the real world
tends to be like that.

7.4 Intellectual Breadth: Quantifying the Generality of an Agent’s
Intelligence

We turn now to a related question: How can one quantify the degree of generality that an
intelligent agent possesses? Above we have discussed the qualitative distinction between AGI
and “Narrow AI”, and intelligence as we have formalized it above is specifically intended as
a measure of general intelligence. But quantifying intelligence is different than quantifying
generality versus narrowness.

To make the discussion simpler, we introduce the term “context” as a shorthand for “envi-
ronment/interval triple (4,9,7).” Given a context (,9,7'), and a set »' of agents, one may
construct a fuzzy set Agygr gathering those agents that are intelligent relative to the context;
and given a set of contexts, one may also define a fuzzy set Con, gathering those contexts with
respect to which a given agent 7 is intelligent. The relevant formulas are:

l Nu,9g,T(Q)V io TP
XAgu er (®) = XCong (9.7) = 7 Dd, = Q 139
Q

where N = N(y,g,T) is a normalization factor defined appropriately, e.g. via N(y,9,T) =
max Vi 9,7-

One could make similar definitions leaving out the computational cost factor Q, but we
suspect that incorporating Q is a more promising direction. We then propose

° At the event, you asked for her business card. Later, you followed her as she was leaving and asked
her if she was “of age.”

° Later, you emailed her to invite her to dinner.

° You planned to dine with her in the restaurant at the Washington D.C. hotel where you were staying.

° You told her to come up to your room first because you needed to finish some work.

To give you some idea of how Moore's Law works, the graph shows
growth in computing power over time; the y-axis is a logarithmic plot
using engineering notation. Because the growth is exponential we rapidly
end up with very large numbers. Scientists use a special notation to cope
with these large and small numbers. In scientific notation a number
is written out in a compact form. For example, three hundred can be
written as 3.0 x 10’. To expand it back to a regular number you move the
decimal point in 3.0 two spots to the right, making the number 300.0. A
similar technique is used for small numbers. To expand 3.0 x 10? move
the decimal point 2 points to the left, giving 0.03. Why use scientific
notation? Well, once the numbers get large they would no longer fit on
a page! We can shorten the representation of numbers even further by
dropping the ‘3.0 x’ part and just looking at the order of magnitude.
The number 10°, one with eighty zeroes after it, is the number of atoms
in the Earth, and 10’ the number of particles in the known Universe.

Even as recently as the early 20 Century, the influential legal commentator, John Wigmore,
proposed that women who accuse men of rape should be subjected to a psychiatric examination
because:

“Modern psychiatrists have amply studied the behavior of errant young girls and women
coming before the court in all sorts of cases. Their psychic complexes are multifarious,
distorted partly by inherent defects, partly by diseased derangements, partly by bad social
environment, partly by temporary psychological or emotional conditions. One form taken
by these complexes is that of contriving false charges of sexual offenses by men. The
unchaste (let us call it) mentality finds incidental but direct expression in the narration of
imaginary sex incidents of which the narrator is the heroine or the victim. On the surface
the narration is straightforward and convincing. The real victims, however, too often in
such cases is the innocent man...”

Even as late as the 1960s, the Supreme Court of Georgia, in rejecting Justice Goldberg’s view
that the death penalty might be unconstitutional for rape, provided the following male-centered
justification for why rapists must be executed:

“We reject this [attempt to reduce the protection of] mothers of mankind, the cornerstone
of civilized society, and the zenith of God’s creation, against a crime more horrible than
death, which is the forcible sexual invasion of her body, the temple of her soul, thereby
soiling for life her purity, the most precious attribute of all mankind [sic!].”

During the last quarter of the 20 Century, political and academic feminism began to focus
attention on the gender inequalities implicit, and often explicit, in rape laws. Within a short period
of time, thousands of years of anachronistic rules governing the prosecution of rape cases were
changed. The testimony of rape victims no longer had to be corroborated. Rape shield laws
prohibited defense attorneys from questioning alleged rape victims about their prior sexual
history. Husbands could be prosecuted for forcing their wives to have sex. The force and
resistance elements of rape were amended in most jurisdictions to require only a lack of consent.
Date rape was punished as seriously as stranger rape. Most importantly, attitudes changed, at
least among some groups which no longer treated predatory males as macho heroes and women
who dressed provocatively as automatically consenting sex partners.

Nearly all of the rules that had made it difficult to prosecute rapists were amended within the
course of little more than a decade, as the pendulum swung quite dramatically from a male-
centered view of rape to a female-centered view. As with many wide swings of a pendulum, there
was little effort to strike a carefully calibrated balance that represented our general approach to all
crimes: namely that there must be a heavy burden of proof on the prosecution and that it is better
for 10 guilty rapists to go free than for even one innocent accused rapist to be wrongly convicted.
Indeed even that salutary rule was challenged by some feminists in the context of rape.” One
influential scholar went so far as to suggest that all sexual intercourse is essentially rape” and that

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025157.txt,"THE INTERACTIVE BRAIN

(working title)

By V.S. Ramachandran

[US — Penguin Press, Audio — Penguin RH; Proposal; Delivery: 24 months from signed contract; 60,000 —
70,000 words]

A new book by neuroscientist V.S. Ramachandran, author most recently of The Tell-Tale Brain.

The Interactive Brain, writes Ramachandran, is a tour of some of the most cherished yet elusive qualities of
our minds. The book argues that recent advances in neurosciences have contributed to a revolutionary new
model of the brain, in which brain function is controlled, not by highly specialized, hierarchical modules, mainly
hard-wired, as once thought, but rather by highly interactive modules that can shift their roles in a matter of days
or even hours The implications are not merely theoretical but have practical applications in medicine, offering
solutions for everyone from stroke patients to those with obsessive compulsive disorder.

There are many neurological syndromes I'll discuss throughout the book. For example, a patient who was
otherwise smart and level-headed but kept insisting that his reflection in the mirror was the 'real David, and that
the David viewing the mirror was a clone. He wiped off a tear from his eye and asked 'Dad, if the real David
returns will you disown me?' Even the axiomatic foundation of our selfhood—the notion that I’m a single
person in one body —is called into question when we encounter patients like him.

Not only can we change our own brains, but we can change the brains of others because of the implications of
mirror neurons. The Interactive Brain incorporates case studies, such as David's, and my own research on topics
ranging through Capgras Syndrome, chronic pain, calendar synesthesia, gender incongruity, mirror visual
feedback, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, the majority of which I have not considered in detail in my
previous books.

I conclude by visiting some of the most prized but elusive aspects of our minds considered unapproachable by
science, such as math, music, and metaphor, and suggest that these quintessentially human abilities are best
elucidated by combining an evolutionary approach with old-fashioned neurology.

V.S. RAMACHANDRAN is the director of the Center for Brain and Cognition and a professor with the
Psychology Department and Neurosciences Program at the University of California, San Diego. He is author of
Phantoms in the Brain, which has been translated into fourteen languages and formed the basis of a two part
series on Channel Four TV (UK) and a 1 hour PBS special in the USA, and more recently The Tell-Tale Brain
which was a New York Times best-seller.

. If we emphasize the

component of the probability (measure, uw) or, equivalently, time spent by the orbit in

cube i, “(C,) instead of simply the number of cubes occupied by any points, M(e),

along with the different length scales of the cube as e—0 we have a generalized
dimension. A common expression for the generalized dimension includes the

fractional pre-factor in q written so as to make things come out right:

: M(e)
D, = ,__finn sel where /(qg,¢) = SLAC I. The higher the q, the greater
q-le—>0 In(e) =

the dominance of the higher probability cubes, ~(C,). To see how this q-induced

separation in emphasis might work, if the ratio for q = 2 between the probability
containing cubes 0.25 and 0.05 is 25, their ratio for q = 3 is 125. For q = 0, the
scaling exponent is the capacity dimension. This result of the actions of a changing
q has been analogized to the way changing temperature in a thermodynamic

system evokes different aspects of its behavior.

The “multifractal formalism” generally begins by determining the statistical
densities over a range of scale lengths by one means or another including wavelet
transformations across wavelength scale (Arneodo et al, 1988). These densities by
scale are then systematically raised to a range of q exponents. Since q, and
therefore Dg, can vary continuously, functions are created that shows how D, varies
with q. These are then further transformed, resulting in a single maximum parabolic
curve whose shape and size is sensitive to the conditions of the experiment (Halsey
et al, 1986). Generalized dimensions decrease as q increases. A unique
neuropsychopharmacological application of the multifractal technique to a study of
the behavioral influence of increasing amounts of cocaine on the time-dependent
patterns of spatial exploration, temporal-spatial fluctuations, in rats, demonstrated a
global splitting in the parabolic distribution suggestive of a cocaine-induced global

phase transition, not unlike the well-known, dose-dependent, amphetamine-induced

was made by Mr. Edwards and me. To the best of my recollection, | did not inform Mr Boies
of our intentions and, to my knowledge, neither he, nor his partner Ms, McCawley, nor atto
Stan Pottinger, were informed in advance of the date or contents of the filing, uy

33. In the course of those public attacks, Mr. Dershowitz made a number of statemenis
to the press that were inconsistent with information that I possessed.

34. Dershowitz said, for example, that his wife accompanied him everywhere: “I've
been married to the same woman for 28 years. She goes with me everywhere. People know that I
won't argue a case or give a speech unless my wife travels with me.” (American Lawyer, Jan.
15, 2015.) Dershowitz also denied being with Epstein in the company of young women: “I was
never alone with Jeffrey Epstein in the company of any young women, I can tell you that
unequivocally.” (Wall Street Journal, Jan. 2, 2015), He cited flight manifests: “As far as the
planes are concemed, there are flight manifests. They will prove I was never on any private
airplane with any young women.” (Hala Gorani, CNN Live, Jan. 5, 2015).

35. Contrary to these assertions, evidence I possessed showed the following things.

36. On February 9, 1998, Alan Dershowitz appears on flight #1073 to Teterboro Airport
with Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, Emmy Taylor, Claire Hazel, Joel Pashcow, one
unidentified female, Mandy and Dubins +1 (without his wife).

37. On February 5, 2004, Alan Dershowitz appears on flight #1695 to Teterboro
Airport, then boards flight #1696 lo Palm Beach with Epstein and Sarah Kellen (without

his wife).

38. On November 17, 2005, Alan Dershowitz appears on flight #1841 to Montreal,
Canada, then boards flight #1842 to Bedford, then #1843 to Teterboro with Epstein,
Adriana Mucinska (AM), and Tatianna Kovylskna (without his wite).

39. To be clear, the flight logs that I had reviewed did not show Mr. Dershowitz alone
with Ms. Giuffre. But | did not have a complete set of flight logs for the relevant time period
and, in addition, it appears that Mr. Dershowitz had access to the flight logs before they were
produced to law enforcement authorities, (See Police Detective Joe Recarey Depo. at 281, Jane
Doe No. 2 v. Epstein, No. 9:08-cv-80119-KAM (Mar. 19, 2010) (Dershowitz personally

provided the flight logs).)

information that I had that contradicted Mr. Dershowitz’s claims.

My 13-year-old daughter would like to be an astronaut when she grows up. Last year she had an
extreme challenge to deal with. The phrase from Apollo 13 “Failure is not an option” sort of became our
motto. I got the idea of contacting the commander of Apollo 13, Jim Lovell. It didn’t take much to find
him and he sent her a wonderful letter about his ordeal just to get into the Apollo program, not to
mention dealing with a crippled spacecraft. His letter made a big difference to my daughter. A couple
months later, we were able to take things a little further by getting her VIP access to a shuttle launch.

in to show reputation. Let me explain why I believe that
argument is fundamentally flawed, and that will, of course,

carry over to other illustrations, as well.

The statement to which defense counsel was referring

was a statement that Ms. Giuffre's mother made during a

deposition as a witness in this case where the only people in

the room were the court reporter and the attorneys. The fact
that when asked, What did you think of your daughter 17 years

ago? Well, I thought at the time that she was a liar, wasn't

something that goes to Ms. Giuffre's reputation because there's

no evidence anybody knew about it other than, you know, the
mother who is now being deposed in 2016.

Moreover, the question was, What did you think about

the fact that your then 17-year-old child was running away from

school? Well, I thought she was lying to me about that. That

would go, I guess, to her reputation back in, what, 1999, 2000,

2001, that time period, but of course the damages that are at

issue in this case are damages around 2016 and thereabouts when

the defamatory statement is released.

So it's hard to see even an argument for the statement

of the mom in a deposition going to reputation. I don't know,

maybe I'm missing something, maybe there's some marginal

relevance that can be distilled out of all of that. But of

course then your Honor has to weigh whatever marginal value

that has as to reputational issues against the very significant

[theory] BDSM Can Be Love Sex Too

initiative Lady Porn Day. This was the result. There's a list of relevant links at the end

BDSM Can Be Love Sex Too

I'm not a big porn consumer, but I have no problem with porn in itself. When I have a
problem with porn, it's because I have a problem with how it was made: because there are
labor issues, or questions of the actors' consent. Sometimes, I get frustrated with the
context in which porn exists or the stereotypes it expresses -- but there, the problem is
with the context and the stereotypes, not with porn in itself. I tend to think that most anti-
porn anxiety arises from irrational grossed-out reactions and stereotype-created fears, and
I try to open up conversations about the ethics of making porn whenever I can.

This isn't to say I don't get angry because many people in our society are pressured to
have sex that doesn't work for them -- but that's not the fault of porn. I certainly get
frustrated by sexual stereotypes, but I don't think porn created those stereotypes.

One stereotype I've been thinking about a lot lately -- one that I see expressed over and
over in BDSM porn -- is the idea that BDSMers don't love our partners, or that love can't
be part of a BDSM relationship. Here's a quotation from Pat Califia's Speaking Sex To
Power that touches on this (note: contains spoilers about the endings of three famous
BDSM novels -- Story of O, Return to the Chateau and Nine And A Half Weeks):

In that sense, the Trumpian and Republican future was already moving beyond this
White House. There was Bannon, working from the outside and trying to take over the
Trump movement. There was the Republican leadership in Congress, trying to stymie
Trumpism—if not slay it. There was John McCain, doing his best to embarrass it. There
was the special counsel’s office, pursuing the president and many of those around him.

The stakes were very clear to Bannon. Haley, quite an un-Trumpian figure, but by far
the closest of any of his cabinet members to him, might, with clever political wiles, entice
Trump to hand her the Trumpian revolution. Indeed, fearing Haley’s hold on the president,
Bannon’s side had—the very morning that Bannon had stood on the steps of the Breitbart
town house in the unseasonable October weather—gone into overdrive to push the CIA’s
Mike Pompeo for State after Tillerson’s departure.

This was all part of the next stage of Trumpism—to protect it from Trump.

General Kelly was conscientiously and grimly trying to purge the West Wing chaos. He
had begun by compartmentalizing the sources and nature of the chaos. The overriding
source, of course, was the president’s own eruptions, which Kelly could not control and
had resigned himself to accepting. As for the ancillary chaos, much of it had been calmed
by the elimination of Bannon, Priebus, Scaramucci, and Spicer, with the effect of making
it quite a Jarvanka-controlled West Wing.

Now, nine months in, the administration faced the additional problem that it was very
hard to hire anyone of stature to replace the senior people who had departed. And the
stature of those who remained seemed to be more diminutive by the week.

Hope Hicks, at twenty-eight, and Stephen Miller, at thirty-two, both of whom had
begun as effective interns on the campaign, were now among the seniormost figures in the
White House. Hicks had assumed command of the communications operation, and Miller
had effectively replaced Bannon as the senior political strategist.

After the Scaramucci fiasco, and the realization that the position of communications
director would be vastly harder to fill, Hicks was assigned the job as the “interim”
director. She was given the interim title partly because it seemed implausible that she was
qualified to run an already battered messaging operation, and partly because if she was
given the permanent job everyone would assume that the president was effectively calling
the daily shots. But by the middle of September, interim was quietly converted to
permanent.

In the larger media and political world, Miller—who Bannon referred to as “my
typist’ —was a figure of ever increasing incredulity. He could hardly be taken out in public
without engaging in some screwball, if not screeching, fit of denunciation and grievance.

D he Tel has run fi ickly; hedge using a Sep17 +17P/-18C collar

BofAML equity telecom analysts have reiterated their recommendation to be cautious
on Deutsche Tel as the company may face regulatory hurdles in their T-Mobile merger.
Given the stock has outperformed European telcos (SXKP} by 15.1% over the past 1
year, investors who own the stock should consider hedging downside with a long DTE
GY Sep17 17 put, short DTE GY Sep17 18 call for 0.46%, in our view. Indeed, spending
0.46% to protect gains is attractive as the price of the structure has rarely been cheaper
(only 14% of the time since Jun-08, Chart 29). Moreover, Chart 30 illustrates that this
structure enables stock owners to protect from losses greater than 2.1% while retaining
3.6% upside potential if the stock rises to 18 (near its 15-year high) by the Sep expiry.

And | use the word clientele to make a final point: innovation in the MOOC world will not just come from educators, but from
any organization that sees the value of massive online and offline courseware. As my own clientele have come to realize,
education in the 21st century is not just something you do before you become an adult but a modality of experience that
empowers you throughout your entire life. No reason for schools to own the entire market for those kinds of experiences.
But! expect the most enterprising schools — especially those with great or underused physical inventory — to partner with
organizations that now have the opportunity to rethink themselves for the education market. In the meantime, it may be time
to reassess the MOOC acronym to make the opportunities more obvious. “Massive Online Offline Communities” seems
more like it. And unlike the online communities of the past, these communities are learning communities, driven by the new
lifelong modality of transformative experience. Expect a land grab for branding and positioning. The disruption in education
is just beginning, and the players are just becoming visible.

Indian Police Arrest Suspects in Two Gang Rapes
Sean Mclain and Khushita Vasan — Wall Street Journal

Indian police Sunday were holding 10 men suspected of involvement in two highly publicized gang-rape cases—one in
urban Mumbai, the other in rural Jnarkhand state—highlighting India's struggles with sexual violence.

In Jharkhand in eastern India, police said they had detained five suspects in connection with the rape of a policewoman by a
group of men who had set up a roadblock on a highway. The attack occurred Thursday, but wasn't reported to police until
Friday, they said.

Five other men were in custody Sunday in the Mumbai case, in which a 22-year-old magazine intern taking photographs of
dilapidated buildings was assaulted Thursday in an abandoned textile mill in the city, police said.

The attacks come as the trial of five people accused in the December gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student ona
Delhi bus entered its final phase. That crime sparked nationwide demonstrations and prompted the government to
introduce harsher penalties for crimes against women.

Protesters took to the streets of Mumbai on Friday to decry the assault on the magazine intern in a city that has a reputation
as arelatively safe place for women. In 2012, the incidence of rape in the Western Indian metropolis was about half the

national rate, according to the National Crime Records Bureau.

I've always felt much safer in Mumbai compared to other Indian cities, said Sanika Prabhu, a television producer from
Mumbai. After this incident, | feel like | don't recognize this city anymore.

Mumbai police said the magazine intern was with a 21-year-old male companion when she was attacked Thursday. The
assailants tied his hands with his belt and raped the woman from 5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m., an official at N.M. Joshi police station
said. Medical tests confirmed the rape, he said.

Under Indian law, rape victims cannot be named in media accounts.

There were 24,915 reported rapes in India in 2012, according to the National Crime Records Bureau, including 233 in
Mumbai. The victims in almost half the Mumbai cases were between 14 and 18 years old.

Activists say the number of rapes is much higher, as many go unreported. India also has a poor record on convictions, with
only around a quarter of alleged rapists convicted in 2010.

In Jharkhand, police said the rape of the police constable occurred at around 1:30 a.m. on Thursday, as she and her

By agreeing to a compressed timeline, the U.S. only narrows its options
and makes a solution even more elusive.

As the United States again contemplates its Iran conundrum, it should
eschew calls for a take-it-or-leave-it deal. The history of Iran's
confrontation with the international community suggests that keeping it a
crisis situation benefits the Islamic Republic. Ironically, it is the Western
powers that have generated alarmist conditions. And then to escape the
predicament of their own making, they offer Iran more concessions and
further incentives.

To avoid a repeat of that outcome, it would be prudent to have a sense of
proportionality and appreciate that, in the end, time works best for the
United States and not the economically beleaguered theocracy.

Mazoltuv Borukhova

In February 2011, I argued the appeal of Mazoltuv Borukhova, whose murder conviction became
the basis of Janet Malcolm’s best seller, Iphigenia in Forest Hills: Anatomy of a Murder Trial.
Borukhova, a young doctor who recently immigrated from Bukhara in the former Soviet Union,
was involved in a hotly contested divorce and custody suit with her dentist husband, who had also
immigrated from Bukhara. Mazoltuv was accused of hiring a cousin from the State of Georgia to
come up to Queens and murder her husband. She was convicted and sentenced to life
imprisonment. The major issue on appeal was similar to the one that resulted in the reversal of
Sandra Murphy’s conviction, namely a hearsay statement, testified to by the murder victim’s
father, describing a statement allegedly made by the murder victim that suggested he feared being
killed by his estranged wife. The court ruled that this statement should not have been admitted
into evidence, but that the other evidence presented to the jury was so overwhelming, that the
error of admitting the hearsay was “harmless’”—that means that the jury would have convicted
Borukhova even if they had never heard this inadmissible evidence. Appellate courts are not
really in a good position to evaluate what a jury would have concluded if certain evidence had
been excluded. The case is now on habeus corpus.

with me at the White House. That privilege he reserved for his special
assistant, Sherman Adams.

When media coverage of a minor scandal in 1958 involving a rug
and a vicuna coat pressured him into letting Adams go, Ike at last revealed
a facet of his humanity to me. “By sheer force of habit,” he remarked, “I
was ready to seek out Sherman’ s advice on whether or not | should fire
him.”

It was not until 1961, after Ike’ s farewell address, that he confided
in me again, this time about a more momentous occasion. “I suppose,”
he began, “my reference to the dangers of the military-industrial complex

Hans Ulrich Obrist

Hans Ulrich Obrist is artistic director of the Serpentine Gallery, London, and the author
of Ways of Curating and Lives of the Artists, Lives of the Architects.

In the Introduction to the second edition of his book Understanding Media, Marshall
McLuhan noted the ability of art to “anticipate future social and technological
developments.” Art is “an early alarm system,” pointing us to new developments in
times ahead and allowing us “to prepare to cope with them... . Art as a radar
environment takes on the function of indispensable perceptual training. . . .”

In 1964, when McLuhan’s book was first published, the artist Nam June Paik was
just building his Robot K-456 to experiment with the technologies that subsequently
would start to influence society. He had worked with television earlier, challenging its
usual passive consumption by the viewer, and later made art with global live-satellite
broadcasts, using the new media less for entertainment than to point us to their poetic and
intercultural capacities (which are still mostly unused today). The Paiks of our time, of
course, are now working with the Internet, digital images, and artificial intelligence.
Their works and thoughts, again, are an early alarm system for the developments ahead of
us.

As a curator, my daily work is to bring together different works of art and connect
different cultures. Since the early 1990s, I have also been organizing conversations and
meetings with practitioners from different disciplines, in order to go beyond the general
reluctance to pool knowledge. Since I was interested in hearing what artists have to say
about artificial intelligence, I recently organized several conversations between artists
and engineers.

The reason to look closely at AI is that two of the most important questions of
today are “How capable will AI become?” and “What dangers may arise from it?” Its
early applications already influence our everyday lives in ways that are more or less
recognizable. There is an increasing impact on many aspects of our society, but whether
this might be, in general, beneficial or malign is still uncertain.

Many contemporary artists are following these developments closely. They are
articulating various doubts about the promises of AI and reminding us not to associate the
term “artificial intelligence” solely with positive outcomes. To the current discussions of
AI, the artists contribute their specific perspectives and notably their focus on questions
of image making, creativity, and the use of programming as artistic tools.

The deep connections between science and art had already been noted by the late
Heinz von Foerster, one of the architects of cybernetics, who worked with Norbert
Wiener from the mid-1940s and in the 1960s founded the field of second-order
cybernetics, in which the observer is understood as part of the system itself and not an
external entity. I knew von Foerster well, and in one of our many conversations, he
offered his views on the relation between art and science:

I’ve always perceived art and science as complementary fields. One shouldn’t
forget that a scientist is in some respects also an artist. He invents anew
technique and he describes it. He uses language like a poet, or the author of a
detective novel, and describes his findings. In my view, a scientist must work in

53, I have seen reports saying or implying that I had sex with former President Bill
Clinton on Little Saint James Island. Former President Bill Clinton was present on the Island at
a time when I was also present on the Island, but I have never had sexual relations with Clinton,
nor have I ever claimed to have had such relations. [I have never seen him have sexual relations
with anyone.

Intensive coverage prompted by the court filings has hinted that Clinton abruptly ceased his flying with Epstein in 2005, not terribly
long before he was arrested, “perhaps because of events related to Epstein’s sexual abuse of children.” The implication is that Clinton
may have known trouble of the worst kind was coming and decided to get out while he could. In fact, the logs show all of Clinton’s

flights came in 2002 and 2003, with not a single appearance aloft recorded in 2004 or 2005.

The closest potential link to Clinton in the period closer to Epstein’s fall, the public record suggests, comes from one of his longtime

confidants, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.

The flight logs indicate Summers flew on Epstein’s jet as far back as 1998, but also on April 15, 2004, September 14, 2005, and
December 21, 2005. The final trip came 10 days after Summers got married, and the log for the flight — from Bedford, Massachusetts,

to the Virgin Islands — shows what appears to be his new bride on board, as well as Ghislaine Maxwell, but not Epstein.

Palm Beach County Court

Epstein was a significant donor to Harvard University, of which Summers was president at the time. According to a spokesperson for

Summers, on a few occasions when Epstein was flying to where Summers was also traveling, he accepted rides on the billionaire’s jet.

Attorneys in the two cases have attempted to get the court to permit discovery from Clinton himself, but have been stymied by motions
from Epstein’s lawyers. Court records show they have also tried unsuccessfully to depose Donald Trump, former New Mexico Gov. Bill
Richardson, former Sony Music head Tommy Mottola, and magician David Copperfield. Notably, a list of 73 proposed witnesses in

Roberts’ trial does not include Clinton.

The tale of Epstein and his sexual activities is undoubtedly a fascinating, and harrowing, one. But with the star witness in one case
swearing under oath that she has no such evidence, and everyone else in a position to know keeping their mouths firmly shut, it is at
this point extremely difficult to draw even a hazy, crooked, dotted line between Epstein’s depredations, in the bedroom or aloft, and

William Jefferson Clinton.

BuzzFeed News reporters Alex Campbell, Kyle Blaine, and Megan Apper contributed to this report.

there's the lie about the tip jar theft, and then there is the

arrest warrant that was issued that plaintiff left the country

for over a decade while that arrest warrant was outstanding.

Your Honor, the fact of police contacts during this

timeframe, including this one, go directly to other issues,

including whether or not plaintiff was truly the sex slave that

she describes. She had an opportunity, because she called th

police on numbers of occasions during the relevant time

period she called them to report a theft, she called them to

help with a civil assist getting her out of her apartment, she

called them for all kinds of reasons -- and at none of those
points of time did she tell the police that she was currently
then a, quote/unquote, sex slave.

Your Honor, the Roadhouse Grill also -—- the Mail On

and confronted her aunt who was being interviewed for one of
their stories about it. The aunt was in the process of saying

what a great niece she had, and then the news asked her about

the Roadhouse Grill theft, and she said, Wow, I didn't even

know that she was working in a burger joint. So it goes to

her internet reputation.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020102.txt,"Some Trumpers, particularly those with over-the-transom access to the president,
believed that he had been tricked into some form of very-much-not-Trump submission.
Roger Stone, one of those people whose calls Kelly was now shielding the president from,
spread the dark scenario that Mattis, McMaster, and Kelly had agreed that no military
action would ever be taken unless the three were in accord—and that at least one of them
would always remain in Washington if the others were away.

After Kelly dispatched Scaramucci, his two immediate issues, now on the table in
Bedminster, were the president’s relatives and Steve Bannon. One side or the other
obviously had to go. Or perhaps both should go.

It was far from clear whether a White House chief of staff who saw his function as
establishing command process and enforcing organizational hierarchy—directing a
decision funnel to the commander in chief—could operate effectively or even exist in a
White House where the commander in chief’s children had special access and overriding
influence. As much as the president’s daughter and son-in-law were now offering slavish
regard for the new command principals, they would, surely, by habit and temperament,
override Kelly’s control of the West Wing. Not only did they have obvious special
influence with the president, but important members of the staff saw them as having this
juice, and hence believed that they were the true north of West Wing advancement and
power.

Curiously, for all their callowness, Jared and Ivanka had become quite a fearsome
presence, as feared by others as the two of them feared Bannon. What’s more, they had
become quite accomplished infighters and leakers—they had front-room and back-channel
power—although, with great woundedness, they insisted, incredibly, that they never
leaked. “If they hear someone talking about them, because they are so careful about their
image and have crafted this whole persona—it’s like anyone who tries to pierce it or say
something against it is like a big problem,” said one senior staffer. “They get very upset
and will come after you.”

On the other hand, while “the kids” might make Kelly’s job all but impossible, keeping
Bannon on board didn’t make a lot of sense, either. Whatever his gifts, he was a hopeless
plotter and malcontent, bound to do an end run around any organization. Besides, as the
Bedminster hiatus—working or otherwise—began, Bannon was once more on the
president’s shit list.

The president continued to stew about The Devil’s Bargain, the book by Joshua Green
that gave Bannon credit for the election. Then, too, while the president tended to side with
Bannon against McMaster, the campaign to defend McMaster, supported by Jared and
Ivanka, was having an effect. Murdoch, enlisted by Jared to help defend McMaster, was
personally lobbying the president for Bannon’s head. Bannonites felt they had to defend
Bannon against an impulsive move by the president: so now, not only did they brand
McMaster as weak on Israel, they persuaded Sheldon Adelson to lobby Trump—Bannon,

numerous reports of orgies on Jeffrey's island involving me and other scientists during our meetings.. Orgies 
that never happened. I am VERY skeptical of other claims on his behavior. I am defending Jeffrey for 2 
reasons: (1) Based on my knowledge and experience I am skeptical of the claims in the media and of those who 
have settled claims for money... namely I don't believe the published details just like I tend to be skeptical of 
many published details on the internet.. I don't believe Jeffrey did what has been claimed, and unless I see hard 
evidence, I will trust my own judgement here, and (2) Jeffrey went to prison, and I happen to believe that 
having served time, even those who questioned his behavior should be willing to give him the benefit of the 
doubt, again until proved otherwise, that he is working hard to live a good life and do good things. I for one am 
disgusted that people eat up the salacious nonsense they read on the web and then jump to conclusions about 
things and people they do not know.. I do not jump to condemn people, especially when it concerns their sexual 
preferences. I DO NOT CONDONE sex with young girls, or young boys for that matter.. because there are real 
victims there.. Until I know all the facts however, I do not jump to conclusions, and I am sorry, having seen the 
media frenzy around Jeffrey, and having seen the shoddy behavior of those who have attacked him, I remain 
skeptical, and I support a man whose character I believe I know.. If you want to condemn me for that, so be it.

Dear Professor Krauss, 
We met briefly after your talk in Ithaca a few months ago — I'm the girl on The Skeptics' Guide to the 
Universe podcast. I've really enjoyed your talks and books, but I was surprised to see you quoted in the 
Daily Beast recently defending Jeffrey Epstein:

Can you confirm if the following quote is accurate? 
If anything, the unfortunate period he suffered has caused him to really think about what he wants to do 
with his money and his time, and support knowledge, says Krauss. Jeffrey has surrounded himself with 
beautiful women and young women but they're not as young as the ones that were claimed. As a scientist 
I always judge things on empirical evidence and he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've 
never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were I would 
believe him over other people. Though colleagues have criticized him over his relationship with Epstein, 
Krauss insists, I don't feel tarnished in any way by my relationship with Jeffrey; I feel raised by it.

secretly briefed on in 2009. Dianne Feinstein, the chair of the Sen-
ate Select Committee, pointed out with privileged knowledge that it
saved “subway cars stuffed to the gunwales with people”; Represen-
tative Mike Rogers also spoke with privileged knowledge when he
said on June 9, 2013, referring to the 702 program, “I can tell you in
the Zazi case in New York, it’s exactly the program that was used.”
The third NSA program of interest to terrorists that Snowden
revealed was called XKeyscore. Using Internet data from PRISM, the
NSA had created the equivalent of digital fingerprints for suspected
foreign terrorists on watch lists. The “fingerprint” for each suspect
was based on his or her search pattern on the Internet. These algo-
rithms made it difficult for suspects to hide on the Internet by using
aliases. Once a suspect was “fingerprinted,” any attempt to evade
surveillance by using a different computer and another user name
would be detected by the XKeyscore algorithms. The “fingerprints”
only worked so long as XKeyscore remained secret from those on
the watch list. After Snowden exposed it, suspects could evade sur-
veillance by changing their search patterns when they changed their
© aliases, ®
Further enabling furtive Internet users to evade the surveillance
of the government, Snowden offered specific tips about the secret
sources and methods used by both the NSA and the British GCHQ.
He revealed in a public interview, for example, that the GCHQ
had deployed the first “full-take” Internet interceptor that “snarfs
everything, in a rolling buffer to allow retroactive investigation
without missing a single bit.” When asked how to circumvent it,
he replied, “You should never route through or peer with the UK
under any circumstances. Their fibers are radioactive, and even the
Queen’s selfies to the pool boy get logged.” Aside from this warning
about using Internet providers whose wiring passes through Britain,
he also warned Internet users about trusting the encryption of any
U.S.-based Internet company because of their secret relationships
with the NSA. He added that the NSA considered “telecom collabo-
rators to be the jewels in their crown of omniscience.” He also gave a
warning about the attention the NSA was paying to “jihadi forums.”
He said that to avoid being automatically “targeted” by the NSA,
one needed to avoid them.

One perfect way to encode a message is to use a one-time pad. On
a sheet of paper I write a completely random set of numbers or letters
— since we are going to translate numbers to letters it does not matter
which. I make a copy and give it to a person I later want to send a coded
message. Because I will only use these two paired sheets once it helps to
make a few of them - a pad in fact. By convention, we refer to a single
sheet or a whole book as a one-time pad code. Here is the one-time pad I
created earlier. It is just a random sequence of letters and spaces.

kaleygngaloiuebldlan dlkawoqyevbax gmlsosuebal

To code a message, I substitute numbers for letters as with the
progressive cypher earlier again using modulo arithmetic to wrap around
if I reach the letter ‘z. I have applied my one-time pad to the hello reader
message below to get ‘sfacngfvbpta.

hello reader

sfacngfvbpta

This code is unbreakable — almost! Notice there are very few clues
for anyone wanting to decode it without holding a copy of the pad. Spaces
do not necessarily indicate breaks between words, and letter patterns are
absent. It has only one flaw. The total number of characters and spaces
could have some meaning. This is a problem because if I routinely
communicated bombing targets and my message was “Bomb Bath’. You
could figure out the sender was not going to bomb Bristol if the message
were shorter than 11 letters and spaces. To avoid this problem, messages
are extended with nonsense at beginning and end to make sure no
information can be gleaned from the length. The convention is to code
messages to the full length of the pad. You must never reuse a pad. Each
time you code a message, rip off that page rather like a calendar. Destroy
it and use the next page for the next message. At the other end, the
recipient uses his copy of the pad to run the process in reverse. Decode
the message by swapping each letter according to the modulo method,
rip the page from the pad, and burn it. Because each key is only used
once you can't use any sort of statistical method to work out the message,
making the one-time pad perfectly secure. Claude Shannon proved this
in 1945 while working for Bell Corporation but, due to wartime secrecy,
his proof was not published until 1948.

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031006.txt,"Would you like to comment on the following:

1. You’ve said that the women pressing suits against Mr. Epstein have lied repeatedly, and in
no way shape or form were they victims. They were at his place freely and voluntarily. And one
of them showed Epstein a fake ID. What do you have to say now that Mr. Epstein has
admitted in his federal plea bargain that he did conspire to entice minors to engage in
prostitution? Accepting that these women came voluntarily, isn’t Mr Epstein still guilty of
statutory rape?

2. Brad Edwards, an attorney who represents three of the women, recently served a
Subpoena to Testify at a Deposition on Epstein’s former girlfriend, Ghislaine
Maxwell. The Subpoena asks that Maxwell produce “a list of all girls” that visited
Jeffrey Epstein’s homes in Palm Beach and Manhattan, or flew on his

planes. Edwards said in an interview that Maxwell was “second-in-command of
Epstein’s criminal enterprise.” He added, “She was on Epstein's plane, transporting girls
for the purpose of having sex with other people. She kept a computer database of hundreds of
girls and oversaw the schedule of girls who came to Epstein's homes.”

3. A suit filed last May by “Jane Doe 102” against Epstein alleges that, after recruiting her as a 15-
year-old girl to give Epstein massages, Maxwell and Epstein took part in “sexually assaulting,
battering, exploiting, and abusing Plaintiff.”

4. The same suit alleges that Epstein “lured” the girl “every day for next two weeks” to his
house. The suit claims that she eventually became a “sex slave” to Epstein, traveling with him
around the world. “In all of these locations, she was required to engage in sex acts with him and
other women - including other minors.”

5. Did Jane Doe 102 — who now lives in Australia — go on the 2002 trip where
President Clinton flew on Mr. Epstein’s Boeing 727?
6. “Most of these acts of abuse occurred during a time when defendant [Jane Doe 102] knew

that the plaintiff was approximately 15, 16 and 17 years old and, after years of daily sexual
exploitation continued into her adulthood ... until she fled at age 19,

7. When Maxwell and Epstein celebrated Jane Doe 102’s 16th birthday with her, Epstein joked that
he would have to “trade her in” because she was getting too old for him.
8. Not only was Jane Doe 102 required to satisfy Epstein's every sexual whim, but she also was

exploited by Epstein's adult male peers. They included “royalty, politicians, academicians,
businessmen and others in various locations around the world.”

9. The Palm Beach Post and lawyers representing Epstein’s alleged victims have called his federal
non-prosecution agreement a “secret,” backroom, sweetheart” deal, noting that none of his
alleged victims was consulted. Several critics have claimed Epstein “bought” the agreement, using
politically-connected lawyers. Would he like to comment?

human trafficking and protecting Planned Parenthood.” And Priebus wanted Donald
Trump to be another kind of Republican altogether.

As Walsh saw it, Steve Bannon was running the Steve Bannon White House, Jared
Kushner was running the Michael Bloomberg White House, and Reince Priebus was
running the Paul Ryan White House. It was a 1970s video game, the white ball pinging
back and forth in the black triangle.

Priebus—who was supposed to be the weak link, thus allowing both Bannon and
Kushner, variously, to be the effective chief of staff—was actually turning out to be quite a
barking dog, even if a small one. In the Bannon world and in the Kushner world,
Trumpism represented politics with no connection to the Republican mainstream, with
Bannon reviling that mainstream and Kushner operating as a Democrat. Priebus,
meanwhile, was the designated mainstream terrier.

Bannon and Kushner were therefore more than a little irritated to discover that the
unimposing Priebus had an agenda of his own: heeding Senate leader Mitch McConnell’s
prescription that “this president will sign whatever is put in front of him,” while also
taking advantage of the White House’s lack of political and legislative experience and
outsourcing as much policy as possible to Capitol Hill.

In the early weeks of the administration, Priebus arranged for House Speaker Paul
Ryan, however much a Trumpist béte noire for much of the campaign, to come into the
White House with a group of ranking committee chairmen. In the meeting, the president
blithely announced that he had never had much patience for committees and so was glad
someone else did. Ryan, henceforth, became another figure with unfettered access to the
president—and to whom the president, entirely uninterested in legislative strategy or
procedures, granted virtual carte blanche.

Almost nobody represented what Bannon opposed as well as Paul Ryan. The essence
of Bannonism (and Mercerism) was a radical isolationism, a protean protectionism, and a
determined Keynesianism. Bannon ascribed these principles to Trumpism, and they ran as
counter to Republicanism as it was perhaps possible to get. What’s more, Bannon found
Ryan, in theory the House’s policy whiz, to be slow-witted if not incompetent, and an easy
and constant target of Bannon’s under-his-breath ridicule. Still, if the president had
unaccountably embraced Priebus-Ryan, he also could not do without Bannon.

Bannon’s unique ability—partly through becoming more familiar with the president’s
own words than the president was himself, and partly through a cunning self-effacement
(upended by his bursts of self-promotion)—was to egg the president on by convincing him
that Bannon’s own views were entirely derived from the president’s views. Bannon didn’t
promote internal debate, provide policy rationale, or deliver Power-Point presentations;
instead, he was the equivalent of Trump’s personal talk radio. Trump could turn him on at

think, actually helps clarify the question your Honor raised
when you came out to court this morning, is an email. It's an
email from Ghislaine Maxwell to Alan Dershowitz, January 6,
2015, and it has a document attached called Four Press

Your Honor will notice that this document is not

marked confidential, it was produced by Ms. Maxwell over a year

ago, it is marked Ghislaine Maxwell 0006, and it's a

communication between herself and Alan Dershowitz, someone with

whom she does not have a joint defense agreement, and that's
why she produced this email.

Your Honor, this email, as you can tell from the date,

was sent four days after the allegedly defamatory statement at

statements from the papers that have been shown to be

completely untrue or show inconsistency in her story. Each

e Isolatedly procedural knowledge is that which is much more easily communicable
demonstratively

e Isolatedly sensory knowledge is that which is much more easily communicable depic-
tively

e Isolatedly attentive knowledge is that which is much more easily communicable indica-
tively

e Isolatedly intentional knowledge is that which is much more easily communicable in-
tentionally

This categorization of knowledge types resembles many ideas from the cognitive theory of
memory [TC05], although the distinctions drawn here are a little crisper than any classification
currently derivable from available neurological or psychological data.

Of course there may be much knowledge, of relevance to systems seeking intelligence accord-
ing to the ECP, that does not fall into any of these categories and constitutes “mixed knowledge.”
There are some very important specific subclasses of mixed knowledge. For instance, episodic
knowledge (knowledge about specific real or hypothetical sets of events) will most easily be
communicated via a combination of declarative, sensory and (in some cases) procedural com-
munication. Scientific and mathematical knowledge are generally mixed knowledge, as is most
everyday commonsense knowledge.

Some cases of mixed knowledge are reasonably well decomposable, in the sense that they
decompose into knowledge items that individually fall into some specific knowledge type. For
instance, an experimental chemistry procedure may be much more easily communicable pro-
cedurally, whereas an allied piece of knowledge from theoretical chemistry may be much more
easily communicable declaratively; but in order to fully communicate either the experimental
procedure or the abstract piece of knowledge, one may ultimately need to communicate both
aspects.

Also, even when the best way to communicate something is mixed-mode, it may be possible
to identify one mode that poses the most important part of the communication. An example
would be a chemistry experiment that is best communicated via a practical demonstration
together with a running narrative. It may be that the demonstration without the narrative
would be vastly more valuable than the narrative without the demonstration. To cover such
cases we may make less restrictive definitions such as

e Interactively declarative knowledge is that which is much more easily communicable
in a manner dominated by linguistic communication

and so forth. We call these “interactive knowledge categories,” by contrast to the “isolated
knowledge categories” introduced earlier.

9.3.0.1 Naturalness of Knowledge Categories

Next we introduce an assumption we call NKC, for Naturalness of Knowledge Categories.
The NKC assumption states that the knowledge in each of the above isolated and interac-
tive communication-modality-focused categories forms a “natural category,” in the sense that
for each of these categories, there are many different properties shared by a large percentage of
the knowledge in the category, but not by a large percentage of the knowledge in the other cat-
egories. This means that, for instance, procedural knowledge systematically (and statistically)
has different characteristics than the other kinds of knowledge.

Mr. Obama pressed his case for reform of
immigration laws and for action to slow
global warming — and, in especially
moving terms, tougher gun laws. In each
case, there may be measures he can take
through executive action, but new laws will
be needed for substantial progress.

Obama failing as commander in chief

Robert D. Blackwill

March 28, 2011 -- The Obama administration deserves credit for its
foreign policy achievements.

There has been no successful terrorist attack on U.S. soil. President
Barack Obama and his colleagues have, thus far, skillfully handled
the popular eruptions in Tunisia and Egypt — though those crises are
far from over. They strengthened sanctions against Iran regarding its
nuclear weapons program; reset U.S.-Russia relations and completed
the New START Treaty. They have begun to deal effectively with the
rise of Chinese power; continued, after a slow start, the
transformation of U.S.-India relations, and signed a bilateral trade
accord with South Korea. They also modernized the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization with summit agreements on a new strategic
concept and ballistic missile defense.

But the administration’s record of failure is equally as long. It has not
seriously tackled our deficit and debt problem, the single greatest
threat to long-term U.S. power and influence. It is now mishandling
relations with the Gulf Arab monarchs and made a mess of the
Middle East peace process. It has allowed the U.S.-Turkey
relationship to reach historic lows, just as Turkey is becoming a
formidable actor in the Greater Middle East.

By concentrating on health care for its first two years, the
administration, and the large majorities in Congress, missed a crucial
opportunity to pass climate change legislation. With the Democratic
party’s internal constituencies, there also has been almost no
movement on international trade.

Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts

next thing I knew, I was sent my victim’s letter, my notification of being a victim through
the US Attorney’s Office and that’s when I knew it was well out there enough not to have
Jeffrey’s lawyers come back on me and discredit me in the same way he had done to all
the other girls. So, I called up Joseph Bird who was the recommended lawyers on my
paperwork that they had given me and started going from there.

JS: So you contact Mr. Joseph Bergs’ office and then you were dealing with his office from
that point forward.

V: That’s correct.

JS: Tell me about the ending of your relationship with Jeffrey. That is, at what point in time
did your full time employment end and how did that happen?

V: Ok. So, it hadn’t really ended. I walked away from it all. Jeffrey sent me to Thailand
where I met my husband and escaped to Australia, never to return back to the states.
About 6-months prior to that, he came up with a proposition that I thought was really
disgustingly sick. And it really showed me for the first time in 4 years I had been with
him that nothing was going to change and I was always just going to be used by him(?)
which I did not like. He offered me a mansion and some of his money every month, I
forget what he called it, a monthly income of what he made to bear one of his children.
The proposition was that if anything ever happened between Jeffrey and I, that I would
have to sign my child over to him basically and that the child would be his and
Ghislaine’s, and I would be looking after it as long as nothing happened between Jeffrey
and I. So, I was kind of freaked out by all of that. I pushed Jeffrey more to please get me
some more training, you know, and I was getting older and not of as much interest to
Jeffrey anyways. I was 19 now, and he likes a female a lot younger. So he sent me to
Thailand, in September 2002_. I was first supposed to meet a girl there and bring her
back with me, but I never met up with her. I proceeded get a short course in Thai massage
so that was to shut me up about my training so I went there, and one of my friends from
school invited me to watch a fight, like a muay thai fight, which is like a form
kickboxing. So I went and watched it, and I saw this guy that was a really good fighter,
and a girl’s word, looked really hot, so I asked my friend who knew him to introduce me.
We got introduced and fell in love immediately, 3 days later Rob proposed and 7 days
later I was being married in a buddist temple. I called Jeffrey and told him I’m sorry, I’m
never coming back. I’ve gotten married, I’ve fallen in love. I thought he’d wish the best
for me but he was kind of rude and he just said “have a good life” and hung up the phone,
and that was the last time I'd talked to him ever until all this started again.

JS: Ok. Virginia, is there anything else that you would like to add to what you have told us
up to this point in time?

V: I'd like to know that this time around something’s going to be done about it and that
Jeffrey and a lot of his colleagues, no matter how rich they are, will know that there is

weight than the other.”

“Why?” I asked Weingarten, when Epstein briefly
steps out of the room, “do so many people keep coming
back here, everything considered.” This was before the
most recent blowup but has been an obvious question
ever since his stint in jail.

“Why we camp out here? I guess because there’s
no place like it.”

Epstein summons in the next person cooling his
heels in the ante-room. It’s a young man named Brock
Pierce, a former child actor and dotcom high flyer—a

Epstein shortly checks to see if his next
appointment is here to join us. Seconds later, Larry
Summers, the former treasury secretary and President of

focuses in on the Bitcoin investor.

prosecution as a result of Mr. Epstein's having entered into the September 24, 2007 Non
Prosecution Agreement with the USAO.

Notably, the Non Prosecution Agreement contains the following agreed condition:

Further, upon execution of this agreement and a plea agreement with the State Attorney’s Office,
the federal Grand Jury investigation will be suspended, and all pending federal Grand Jury
subpoenas will be held in abeyance unless and until the defendant violates any term of this
agreement. The defendant likewise agrees to withdraw his pending motion to intervene and to
quash certain grand jury subpoenas.

See Tab 21, September 24, 2007 Non Prosecution Agreement. It also guarantees that persons
identified in the Grand Jury subpoena such and Leslie Groff
and others will not be prosecuted. The new Grand Jury subpoena clearly violates the Non-
Prosecution Agreement. Although Mr. Epstein has exercised his rights to appeal to the
Department of Justice with the full consent and knowledge of the USAO, he has not breached the
Agreement. The re-commencing of the Grand Jury is in violation of the Agreement.

But further, the new investigation, which features a wide-ranging, fishing-expedition type
to search in New York does nothing to satisfy the very essential elements of federal statutes that
are lacking despite the intensity of an over two-year investigation in the Palm Beach area.
Absent evidence of Internet luring, inducements while using the phone, travel for the purpose,
fraud or coercion, the subject of the New York investigation is as lacking in the essential basis
for converting a state case into a federal case as is the remainder of the Florida investigation.

The reaching out to New York to fill the void emanating from the failures of the Florida
investigation compellingly demonstrates the misuse of federal resources in an overzealous, over-
personalized, selective and extraordinary attempt to expand federal law to where it is has never
gone. This last-ditch attempt by Ms. Villafana reinforces our belief that the USAO does not have
facts that, without distortion, would justify a prosecution of Mr. Epstein.

In view of the prosecution’s often-verbalized desire to punish Mr. Epstein, we believe
that the prosecution summary suffers from critical inaccuracies and aggregates the expected
testimony of witnesses so as to reach a conclusion of guilt. Our contention is reinforced by the
fact that key prosecution witnesses have provided evidence and testimony that directly
undermines the prosecution’s misleading and inaccurate summary of its case. Indeed, we now
have received statements from three of the principal accusers (through a state
criminal deposition), (through a federal FBJ-USAO sworn and transcribed
interview), and [MA (through a defense—generated sworn transcribed interview).
Each of these witnesses categorically denies each essential element that the prosecution will have
to prove in order to convert this quintessential state-law case into a federal matter.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013094.txt,"178 10 A Mind-World Correspondence Principle

10.2 What Might a General Theory of General Intelligence Look
Like?

It’s not clear, at this point, what a real general theory of general intelligence would look like
— but one tantalizing possibility is that it might confront the two questions:

e How does one design a world to foster the development of a certain sort of mind?
e How does one design a mind to match the particular challenges posed by a certain sort of
world?

One way to achieve this would be to create a theory that, given a description of an environment
and some associated goals, would output a description of the structure and dynamics that a
system should possess to be intelligent in that environment relative to those goals, using limited
computational resources.

Such a theory would serve a different purpose from the mathematical theory of universal
intelligence developed by Marcus Hutter [Hut05] and others. For all its beauty and theoreti-
cal power, that approach currently gives it useful conclusions only about general intelligences
with infinite or infeasibly massive computational resources. On the other hand, the approach
suggested here is aimed toward creation of a theory of real-world general intelligences utilizing
realistic amounts of computational power, but still possessing general intelligence comparable
to human beings or greater.

This reflects a vision of intelligence as largely concerned with adaptation to particular classes
of environments and goals. This may seem contradictory to the notion of general intelligence,
but I think it actually embodies a realistic understanding of general intelligence. Maximally
general intelligence is not pragmatically feasible; it could only be achieved using infinite com-
putational resources [ITut05]. Real-world systems are inevitably limited in the intelligence they
can display in any real situation, because real situations involve finite resources, including finite
amounts of time. One may say that, in principle, a certain system could solve any problem
given enough resources and time but, even when this is true, it’s not necessarily the most in-
teresting way to look at the system’s intelligence. It may be more important to look at what a
system can do given the resources at its disposal in reality. And this perspective leads one to
ask questions like the ones posed above: which bounded-resources systems are well-disposed to
display intelligence in which classes of situations?

As noted in Chapter 7 above, one can assess the generality of a system’s intelligence via
looking at the entropy of the class of situations across which it displays a high level of intelligence
(where “high” is measured relative to its total level of intelligence across all situations). A system
with a high generality of intelligence will tend to be roughly equally intelligent across a wide
variety of situations; whereas a system with lower generality of intelligence will tend to be much
more intelligent in a small subclass of situations, than in any other. The definitions given above
embody this notion in a formal and quantitative way.

If one wishes to create a general theory of general intelligence according to this sort of
perspective, the main question then becomes how to represent goals/environments and systems
in such a way as to render transparent the natural correspondence between the specifics of the
former and the latter, in the context of resource-bounded intelligence. This is the business of
the next section.

private practice in South Florida with personal relationships to some of the prosecutors involved.
Federal prosecutors then leaked highly sensitive information about the case to a New York
Times reporter.! The immediate result of this confluence of extraordinary circumstances is an
onslaught of civil lawsuits, all save one brought by the First Assistant’s former boutique law firm
in Miami.

The facts in this case all revolve around the classic state crime of solicitation of
prostitution.2 The State Attorney’s Office in Palm Beach County had conducted a diligent
investigation, convened a Grand Jury that returned an indictment, and made a final determination
about how to proceed. That is where, in our federal republic, this matter should rest.
Mr. Epstein faces a felony conviction in state court by virtue of his conduct, and the only reason
the State has not resolved this matter is that the federal prosecutors in Miami have continued to
insist that we, Mr. Epstein’s counsel, approach and demand from the State Attorney’s Office a
harsher charge and a more severe punishment than that Office believes are appropriate under the
circumstances. Yet despite the USAO’s refusal to allow the State to resolve this matter on the
terms the State has determined are appropriate, the USAO has not made any attempt to
coordinate its efforts with the State. In fact, the USAO mandated that any federal agreement
would be conditioned on Mr. Epstein persuading the State to seek a criminal punishment unlike
that imposed on other defendants within the jurisdiction of the State Attorney for similar
conduct.

From the inception of the USAO’s involvement in this case, which at the end of the day
is a case about solicitation of prostitution within the confines of Palm Beach County, Florida, we
have asked ourselves why the Department of Justice is involved. Regrettably, we are unable to
suggest any appropriate basis for the Department’s involvement. Mr. Epstein has no criminal
history whatsoever. Also, Mr. Epstein has never been the subject of general media interest until |
a few years ago, after it was widely perceived by the public that he was a close friend of former
President Bill Clinton.

The conduct at issue is simply not within the purview of federal jurisdiction and lies
outside the heartland of the three federal statutes that have been identified by prosecutors—18
USS.C. §§ 1591, 2422(b), and 2423(b).

1 One of the other members of Mr. Epstein’s defense team, Jay Lefkowitz, has personally reviewed the reporter’s
contemporaneous notes.

2 Although some of the women alleged to be involved were 16 and 17 years of age, several of these women
openly admitted to lying to Mr. Epstein about their age in their recent sworn statements.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019967.txt,"blank stare. It also fed one theory of why hiring in the West Wing and throughout the
executive branch was so slow—filling out the vast bureaucracy was out of his view and
thus he couldn’t care less. Likewise, visitors with appointments were befuddled by the
West Wing’s own lack of staff: after being greeted with a smart military salute by the dress
marine at the West Wing door, they discovered that the West Wing often lacked a political-
appointee receptionist, leaving guests to find their own way through the warren that was
the Western world’s pinnacle of power.

Trump, a former military academy cadet—albeit not an enthusiastic one—had touted a
return to military values and expertise. In fact, he most of all sought to preserve his
personal right to defy or ignore his own organization. This, too, made sense, since not
really having an organization was the most efficient way to sidestep the people in your
organization and to dominate them. It was just one irony of his courtship of admired
military figures like James Mattis, H. R. McMaster, and John Kelly: they found
themselves working in an administration that was in every way inimical to basic command
principles.

7 OK Ok

Almost from the beginning, the West Wing was run against the near-daily report that the
person charged with running it, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, was about to lose his job.
Or, if he was not about to lose his job, the only reason he was keeping it was that he had
not had it long enough to yet be fired from it. But no one in Trump’s inner circle doubted
that he would lose his job as soon as, practically speaking, his losing it would not
embarrass the president too much. So, they reasoned, no one need pay any attention to
him. Priebus, who, during the transition, doubted he would make it to the inauguration,
and then, once in, wondered if he could endure the torture for the minimally respectable
period of a year, shortly reduced his goal to six months.

The president himself, absent any organizational rigor, often acted as his own chief of
staff, or, in a sense, elevated the press secretary job to the primary staff job, and then
functioned as his own press secretary—treviewing press releases, dictating quotes, getting
reporters on the phone—which left the actual press secretary as a mere flunky and
whipping boy. Moreover, his relatives acted as ad hoc general managers of whatever areas
they might choose to be general managers in. Then there was Bannon, conducting
something of an alternate-universe operation, often launching far-reaching undertakings
that no one else knew about. And thus Priebus, at the center of an operation that had no
center, found it easy to think there was no reason for him to be there at all.

At the same time, the president seemed to like Priebus more and more quite for the
reason that he seemed entirely expendable. He took Trump’s verbal abuse about his height
and stature affably, or anyway stoically. He was a convenient punching bag when things
went wrong—and he didn’t punch back, to Trump’s pleasure and disgust.

• Research on each of the 13 episodes is ongoing and we are moving towards creating a short list of the top 
contributors per episode (with some contributors in multiple episodes). 
• We are aggregating the top contributors around 4 to 5 central locations, such as SF Bay Area, LA, Chicago, 
Boston, New York, Santa Fe, London, Oxford, and Cambridge for the main shoots. 
• We are creating a short list of locations for the secondary shoot - i.e. the more observational shoots on 
specific labs and research facilities, such as the Music Lab at McGill, the Sleep Lab at Harvard. 
• We are planning a recce in the autumn to assess locations and meet some of the key contributors. 
• We've brought on a production manager / line producer as we develop detailed research, contributors, 
locations, budgets. 
• Our team is working toward interviewing and hiring a top science-literate associate producer / dedicated 
research producer. We've been coordinating with colleagues at HHMI (Howard Hughes Medical Association) 
as well as National Geographic for staffing referrals, and now have a strong short list. This is a critical, long-
term position. 
• We are assessing graphics and animation companies and researching styles and graphic ideas that we might 
use to communicate some of the more complex ideas. 
• Our digital team is researching a web extension for the www.closertotruth.com website, developing ideas for 
a dedicated site neighborhood for Radical Breakthroughs. We are in discussions with several website 
design companies, including the company that designed and built our original CTT site, for ideas and bids on 
creating the expanded site. 
• By mid-October, we expect to begin to schedule the shoots.

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015912.txt,"222 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?

The eye, hand and pencil of a human mathematician was modeled
as the read-write head of a teletype. It allowed the machine to read
input from the tape and write information back so as to keeping track of
intermediate calculations or provide the final output. The operation of
the machine was straightforward. At each moment in time the machine
could read a symbol on the tape, move the tape forward or backwards,
and write or erase a symbol. That's all he needed to model a human doing
something like long multiplication. Turing argued his model was exactly
analogous to a human performing a computation.

Turing’s imaginary machine was now able to perform computations
just like a human. You could write down the rules for a given procedure
and the machine could, for example, do long multiplication. At each step
of the calculation, the computer would examine the state machine, look
up the state in the instruction book and put the machine into its new
state. If you recall Searle’s Chinese Room, this is the same process the
man in the room followed: get a symbol, look it up in a book, and reply
with the corresponding symbol.

Universal Turing Machine

We have missed one important step from our explanation of the modern
computer: the ability to run programs. Nowadays, we take for granted
you can download a program from the Internet or buy one from a shop.
In the 1930s adapting a single machine to multiple purposes was a radical
idea. Machines were built to do one thing, and one thing only, and there
was no concept of a general-purpose machine. Nowadays this is hard to
comprehend, but there is a similar revolution going on in manufacturing
today with the widespread adoption of 3D printing. Today most factories
use tools — lathes, drills and saws — to fashion objects. Each machine does
a specific job and is not ‘general purpose. But innovative new machines
can now be purchased relatively inexpensively called 3D fabricators,
which print entire objects. The same happened for electronic logic in
Turing’s time.

Before computers, logical tasks were performed by banks of relays.
How these banks work can be illustrated by the workings of an old-
fashioned elevator. If you pressed a button to call an elevator, you closed
a switch coupled to a relay in the basement sending power to the car.
Another switch was tripped automatically when the elevator reached the
desired floor. All the functioning of the elevator system was fixed. Once
you pressed a button to go up you could not change your mind and press

lawsuit to block the deal is politically motivated by President Trump's antipathy for
CNN, which Time Warner owns. AT&T says it wasn't asked to offload any assets as
part of the deal until after Trump took office.

° What they're saying: “We respect the judge’s decision and look forward to
the upcoming trial,” said Dan Petrocelli, who is leading AT&T and Time Warner's
defense in the case, in a statement.

° At a hearing on Friday, a Justice Department lawyer said that AT&T's

Fund scoop: Niv Dror, who joined AngelList through its acquisition of Product Hunt
in 2016, is raising a small early-stage fund focused on consumer products, multiple
sources tell Axios. Dror declined to comment.

° The fund will raise at least $1 million, though one source says it could go up to
$2-3 million.

° Like Product Hunt colleague Ryan Hoover’s own VC fund, Dror’s will be
managed on the back-end by AngelList.

Same old story: Yesterday, I grabbed coffee with Day One Ventures founder Masha
Drokova, and heard a familiar—and still disappointing—story: While raising her fund,
she was told by prospective investors that she should get a male co-founder.

° She initially considered the suggestion, she told me, before remembering it's
rooted in sexism.

Mubadala, are already investors.

° And it’s not the only one visiting the region’s investors—funds focused on tokens
and cryptocurrencies have also been fundraising in the area, I’m told.

legislation. The chair of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Intelligence & Security,
Andrew Hastie, named one of Australia’s most generous political donors as a “co-
conspirator” in a UN bribery investigation and linked the affair to covert interference.
“In Australia it is clear that the Chinese Communist Party is working to covertly
interfere with our media and universities and also to influence our political processes
and public debates,” Hastie told his committee, after receiving support from the deputy
chair, Anthony Byrne. “And it’s time we applied sunlight to our political system and a
person who has featured prominently in Australian politics over the past decade,.”™

The counter-interference criminal legislation and the foreign influence transparency
scheme both passed through Parliament on June 28. The Home Affairs legislation had
passed through Parliament earlier in the year, with the counter-foreign-interference
task force established in April 2018. This effectively elevated the importance of
countering foreign interference to a similar status as countering terrorism.” At the time
of writing, the legislation to ban foreign political donations has not passed through
Parliament. And Turnbull himself has been replaced as prime minister. The new prime
minister, Scott Morrison, appears to have opted for policy continuity.

The Turnbull government led the way in diagnosing the challenge, forging an internal
consensus, and setting out a bold and coherent counterstrategy. Australia became the
first country in the world to lay the foundations for a sustained and coherent counter-
interference strategy.

But if Australia is going to reset the terms of its engagement with a superpower—holding
China to its principle of noninterference and setting a precedent of sovereign equality
that others might follow—then it will have to accept strains on the bilateral relationship.
If the government is to successfully implement a transformational strategy to defend
Australia’s democratic processes and social cohesion, then it has to find politically
sustainable ways of engaging the democratic process and publicly making the case.

FINANCE AND OPERATIONS

Craig L. Slutzkin, (39), is Chief Financial Officer and manages the back office, compliance and
administrative functions for New Leaf. Craig joined Sprout as Vice President and the head of
its back office operations in August 2002 and transitioned to New Leaf at the time of the spin-
out. Prior to joining Sprout, he spent over seven years in the audit and assurance practices of
Arthur Andersen and Ernst & Young in New York, attaining the position of Senior
Manager. While at Andersen and Ernst & Young, clientele included various multi-strategy
private equity and venture capital fund firms as well as top tier investment banks. Craig
received his M.B.A. in finance from Columbia Business School and received a B.A. in
Accounting and Information Systems from Queens College. He is a certified public accountant
and a member of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.

INDUSTRY ADVISORS

The Fund Managers work closely with industry professionals who are experts in New Leaf’s
fields of interest and are willing to work closely with the Fund Managers on an as needed basis
to provide their perspectives on topics and issues that are relevant to due diligence on new
investments, on-going issues that arise in the management of existing portfolio companies, and
longer term fund strategy. New Leaf’s advisors are all prominent in their fields, and hold
senior positions within leading corporations and academic institutions. These experts provide
New Leaf and its portfolio companies with their own invaluable insights, but equally
importantly open up their networks of contacts in ways that vastly expand and strengthen New
Leaf’s own network.

Therapeutics Advisors
New Leaf works with a broad range of industry advisors to support its investment activities in

therapeutics. The Fund Managers work on an as needed basis with a large group of advisors
that includes contacts from industry and academia that each of the investment professionals
within the firm has cultivated through their own professional and academic experiences. The
Fund Managers solicit input from advisors on an as needed basis to get valuable input on
specific scientific, clinical, and commercial issues and topics relevant to diligence on new
investment opportunities, and to the management of existing portfolio companies. This
network gives New Leaf timely and valuable access to some of the world’s leading academic
scientists and experienced practitioners/executives from industry, and brings their subject
matter expertise to bear across the myriad of topics that are critical to New Leaf’s decision
making in the therapeutics sectors. Because of the breadth of topics where this type of outside
input is required, and due to the fact that the science and technology is evolving rapidly in most
of these fields, New Leaf has not created a formal advisory board for therapeutics

Information Convergence Advisory Board

The Fund Managers have assembled an additional advisory board to support activities in
Information Convergence. This group of advisors has a breadth of experience in the
development and deployment of new information technologies that are reshaping healthcare.

don’t want to learn, or is something else more complex going on?
I will summarize these five issues as follows:

ABILITY
POSSIBILITY
METHODOLOGY
CONSTRAINTS
GOAL ALIGNMENT

School is subject-based and, further, those subjects are predefined and
agreed upon by those in charge. Without giving a history of how this
state of affairs came to be,' or why it is an issue, it is first necessary to
note that it is the case. I say this because when we were students in
school, we accepted the fact that school was the way it was, and we
assumed that it was the way it was supposed to be. We may not think
each subject we learn is valuable or interesting, and perhaps we long
to learn different subjects, but never do we hear people suggest that
there shouldn't be subjects in school at all. This is a very difficult idea
to swallow. There have always been subjects. What else would there
be? What would it mean to not have subjects?

Answering this question is the aim of this book. We need to under-
stand what goes on in schools and what might be preferable. The issue
really is not schooling at all. The real issue is how learning actually
takes place in the human mind.

Ask a student how he is doing in school and he will tell you the
subjects he likes. I like English but Iam bad at math, he might say. This
is such a normal sentiment among students that we never think about
how weird a sentiment it really is. We don’t ask: How are you doing at
life? We could ask that of a teenager and she might say: I am good at
dating but bad at driving.

But, actually, you would never hear teenagers say something like
that. This is weird because, in general, dating and driving are much
more important subjects in a teenager’s world than English and math.
But they don’t talk about whether they are good at it or bad at it in
the same way.

They continue to practice and get better at those things because
they care about them. Saying, I am bad at math, means, in essence,

... and I don’t care and have stopped trying because I don’t see the point.
Saying, I am good at English, typically means, I am getting a good grade
in English. This state of affairs defines the main problem in education:

concerning ... [a] plea. !°7 But this brief mention in the rule is inferior to my specific proposal for several reasons. First, Rule
11 is the script when federal judges accept guilty pleas. Victims should be directly included here so that judges do not
inadvertently overlook victims’ rights. Second, stating only that victims may be reasonably heard regarding a plea, without
explaining how that will occur, invites litigation and uncertainty. For example, is a victim reasonably heard when allowed to be
heard only through written submission? !°° Is a victim treated fairly if the court is required to address the defendant in open
court but not to address the victim? If the court does not address the victim, when should the victim try to interrupt the
proceedings to be heard? Should the victim's views enter into the court's calculation about whether to accept the plea? All of
these questions are answered in a simple and straightforward way by my proposal - a proposal which the Advisory Committee
should adopt.

Rule 11(c)(1) - Prosecution To Consider Victims’ Views on Pleas The Proposals:

I proposed that the prosecution should be required to consider victims' views in developing any proposed plea arrangement as
follows:

(1) In General. An attorney for the government and the defendant's attorney, or the defendant when proceeding pro se, may
discuss and reach a plea agreement. The court must not participate in these discussions. The attorney for the government shall
make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider the victims’ views about, any proposed plea negotiations. If
the defendant pleads guilty or nolo contendere to either a charged offense or a lesser or related offense, [*888] the plea
agreement may specify that an attorney for the government will ... [listing various options]. !°?

The Advisory Committee did not recommend any change. °°

Discussion:

My proposed change required prosecutors to make reasonable efforts to notify victims about pleas and to consider the victims’
views regarding pleas. This requirement was taken almost verbatim from the Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and
Witness Assistance, which already directs prosecutors to make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider
victims' views about, prospective plea negotiations. !©! According to the Department of Justice, twenty-nine states [already]

require prosecutors to consult with’ or obtain the views of victims at the plea agreement stage. 1°

sentencing), and United States v. Turner, 367 F. Supp. 2d 319, 333 (E.D.N.Y. 2005) (noting in dicta that § 3771(a)(4) requires the victim to

with the DEA. Any person that manufactures, distributes, dispenses or otherwise possesses a controlled
substance in violation of the CSA is subject to civil and criminal penalties.

The CSA schedules are numbered I to V. Schedule I substances are subject to the strictest controls,
and Schedule V substances are subject to the least restrictive controls. A controlled substance is listed
on a particular schedule according to four factors:

(i) The substance’s potential for abuse.

(ii) Whether the substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United
States,

(iii) Whether the substance is accepted as safe to use under medical supervision.

(iv) The degree of physical and psychological dependence that may result from abuse of the
substance.

Upon enactment in 1970, the CSA assigned each controlled substance to a specific schedule. The
U.S. Congress may legislate a controlled substance’s addition to or removal from a CSA schedule. The
CSA also provides a regulatory framework for a substance to be added to or removed from a schedule;
such change generally involves a recommendation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (DHHS) and concurrence with that recommendation by the DEA. The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, an agency of the DHHS, is charged with making certain safety-related determinations
used in DHHS scheduling recommendations.

Schedule I controlled substances are those found by the U.S. Congress or the DEA and the DHHS
to have a high potential for abuse, to have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United
States and to have a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision. Current Schedule I sub-
stances include marijuana, THC, heroin, ecstasy, LSD and peyote. Unlike Schedule II through Sched-
ule V controlled substances, which can be prescribed by a doctor, the CSA does not allow prescriptions
to be written for Schedule I controlled substances.

Marijuana
Marijuana has been a Schedule I controlled substance since enactment of the CSA in 1970. The CSA

defines “marijuana” as

all parts of the plant Cannabis sativa L., whether growing or not; the seeds thereof: the
resin extracted from any part of such plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, deriv-
ative, mixture, or preparation of such plant, its seeds or resin. Such term does not include
the mature stalks of such plant, fiber produced from such stalks, oil or cake made from
the seeds of such plant, any other compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or
preparation of such mature stalks (except the resin extracted therefrom), fiber, oil, or cake,
or the sterilized seed of such plant which is incapable of germination.

The parts and derivatives of the cannabis plant that are excluded from the CSA definition of
marijuana have industrial uses and generally contain little or no THC. Non-marijuana cannabis
products—commonly known as hemp products—including rope, clothing, animal feed and soap,
are not subject to control under the CSA. The CSA does not restrict such non-marijuana products

Government’s confidential “list of victims.” Most of these lawsuits seek $50
million in money damages.

e Assistant U.S. Attorney David Weinstein spoke about the case in great detail to
Landon Thomas, a reporter with the New York Times, and revealed confidential
information about the Government’s allegations against Mr. Epstein. The Assistant
U.S. Attorney also revealed the substance of confidential plea negotiations.

e When counsel for Mr. Epstein complained about the media leaks, First Assistant
Sloman responded by asserting that “Mr. Thomas was given, pursuant to his
request, non-case specific information concerning specific federal statutes.” Based
on Mr. Thomas’ contemporaneous notes, that assertion appears to be false. For
example, Mr. Weinstein told Mr. Thomas that federal authorities believed that
Mr. Epstein had lured girls over the telephone and traveled in interstate commerce
for the purpose of engaging in underage sex. He recounted to Mr. Thomas the
USAO’s theory of prosecution against Mr. Epstein, replete with an analysis of the
key statutes being considered. Furthermore, after Mr. Epstein’s defense team
complained about the leak to the USAO, Mr. Weinstein, in Mr. Thomas’ own
description, then admonished him for talking to the defense, and getting him in
trouble. Mr. Weinstein further told him not to believe the “spin” of Mr. Epstein’s
“high-priced attorneys,” and then, according to Mr. Thomas, Mr. Weinstein
forcefully “reminded” Mr. Thomas that all prior conversations were merely
hypothetical.

We are constrained to conclude that the actions of federal officials in this case strike at
the heart of one of the vitally important, enduring values in this country: the honest enforcement
of federal law, free of political considerations and free of the taint of personal financial
motivations on the part of federal prosecutors that, at a minimum, raise the appearance of serious
impropriety.

We were told by U.S. Attorney Acosta that as part of the review he requested, the
Department had the authority, and his consent, to make any determination it deemed appropriate
regarding this matter, including a decision to decline federal prosecution. Yet, CEOS’s only
conclusion, based on its limited review of the investigation, is that U.S. Attorney Acosta would
not abuse his discretion by proceeding against Mr. Epstein. Thus, the decision of whether

4 — As recently as two months ago, Mr. Sloman was still listed publicly as a part of his former law firm. While we
assume this was an oversight, Mr. Sloman’s identification as part of the firm raises the appearance of
impropriety.

everything. But it has me pulled between wanting to see really cool gadgets and avoiding a Big
Brother-like society.

The latest is a new high-tech tennis shoe coming to the market that lets parents and guardians track
the movements of their family using Global Positioning Systems or GPS technology.

Called the Smart Shoe,” the miniature device is inserted in the sole of the low-top sneaker. An
antenna that runs up the back of the footwear communicates with satellites and relays a location
back to a subscription Web site service for easy viewing. Los Angeles-based GTXC, which makes
the devices and the service, said it is hoping to put Smart Shoes in stores by the end of the year.
Shoes with the technology could cost between $100 and $200. The tracking service is expected to

cost about $20 a month.
Follow That Kid

Today's technology makes it easier for parents to know where their kids are and what they're
doing.

By Joe Burris | Baltimore Sun | July 1, 2007

Michelle Smith had been reluctant to buy a cell phone for her 7-year-old daughter, Daysha. Then
one day in April, a substitute teacher placed the Radford, Va., girl on the wrong school bus.
Instead of being dropped off at her older sister's after-school program as planned, Daysha was sent
home - only to find the doors locked.

As she sat on her front porch crying, her mother drove around town, searching frantically for the
girl. No one at the school could tell her which bus the girl had been put on.
Then my next-door neighbor called, said Smith, and said, 'I have your baby.' 

The scary moment had a happy ending, but Smith didn't want to take a chance on losing her
daughter again. So she did what many other parents are doing - she bought her child a cell phone

equipped with an electronic device that could keep track of her whereabouts.

Tracking technology hits the ground running.

Al-Ahram Weekly

New paradigm in Palestine

Mahmoud Musa and Awni Sarrif

30 June - 6 July 2011 -- All roads to a meaningful settlement of the
Arab Israeli conflict are at a dead end. Nevertheless, should two
states be established in historic Palestine, bloody conflict will persist.
Putting aside disputes over natural resources, Israel will remain a
Zionist supremacist state with a clear arsenal that can turn the entire
Middle East into an inferno, and the enclaved improvised Palestinian
Arab entity cannot exist without aid from the outside world. There
will be democracy for the Jewish people of Israel, with second and
perhaps third class citizenships for all others.

The Palestinians, as the last twenty years have shown, will be ruled
under an autocratic corrupt police state. The plight of the Palestinian
refugees living outside the new Palestine will continue and their right
to return totally forgotten. The Jordanian regime may collapse to
become the alternate home leading to civil wars between the
indigenous Jordanians and the Palestinians. It is also reasonable to
assume that, in order to preserve the Jewish identity of Israel, another
Nakba will befall the Israeli Arabs who may be relocated to areas in
the West Bank.

There can only be one solution -- one state where Palestinians and
Israelis alike are equal citizens in a nation that belongs indeed to the
Middle East. Three conditions must be met for the new state to take
hold: dissolving the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah and the Hamas
Government in Gaza, the rejection of Zionism by the Israelis, and the
return of the Palestinian refugees. These can only be accomplished
under the auspices of the United Nations (UN).

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018648.txt,"Oh yes, rape culture can happen in BDSM just the same way it happens in the vanilla
mainstream. And there are certainly people in my local community who I would never
get involved with, because I do not trust them.

Being defensive about BDSM and abuse won't help; yes, BDSM is stigmatized and
stereotyped, but the abuse is still a problem. So after I started blogging, I tried to move
past my defensiveness and write more concretely -- to write about what exactly the
BDSM community does to work against abuse. One of my first posts on BDSM and
abuse was called Evidence That The BDSM Community Does Not Enable Abuse.” It
highlighted anti-abuse initiatives within the BDSM community. As I learned more about
BDSM and abuse, and my perspective got more nuanced, I wrote a more expansive post
called The Alt Sex Anti-Abuse Dream Team.” It covered all the information I'd given in
the earlier post, and also talked about how I personally would structure an anti-abuse
initiative with alt-sex people in mind.

Looking back now, those posts still strike me as defensive. I was making good points, but
I also think that I didn't fully understand where some feminists are coming from when
they react negatively to BDSM. This past year, I've learned a lot more about abusive
gender-based violence, power, and control. And I've concluded that while BDSM is
obviously not equivalent to abuse, we need better theory to describe the difference
between BDSM and abuse, and we should try to avoid defensiveness while articulating
that theory.

I've written before that one thing I think people can do is try to start from a position of
strength, and seek strength afterwards. The overall point of that maxim is that any given
BDSM activity can eventually make all parties feel more supported, more capable, more
powerful in the world. That's my ideal end goal; that is what I personally would aim for
with my BDSM practice. Perhaps I might do an intense BDSM scene that makes me
feel terrible in the moment -- or for a lot of moments... but I want to be sure it will
make me more supported, more capable, more powerful later.

That's an awfully vague maxim, though, and one that can be different for every person. I
may have found a more concrete focus in a 1984 anti-abuse concept -- the Power &
Control Wheel:

In 1984, staff at the Domestic Abuse Intervention Project (DAIP) began developing
curricula for groups for men who batter and victims of domestic violence. We wanted a
way to describe battering for victims, offenders, practitioners in the criminal justice
system and the general public. Over several months, we convened focus groups of women
who had been battered. We listened to heart-wrenching stories of violence, terror and
survival. After listening to these stories and asking questions, we documented the most
common abusive behaviors or tactics that were used against these women. The tactics
chosen for the wheel were those that were most universally experienced by battered
women.

Ina BDSM context, a lot of the behaviors listed on the Power & Control Wheel could be
part of a consensual encounter -- violence, headgames, name-calling, all kinds of things
can be BDSM. But this part, this is important:

US are betraying the trust of their customers, which I can prove.”
He even proffered evidence implicating President Barack Obama in
illegal surveillance. “There is a detailed policy framework, a kind of
martial law for cyber operations, created by the White House. It’s
called presidential policy 20,” he wrote to her. It was an eighteen-
page directive that Obama had signed four months earlier in Octo-
ber 2012. Snowden was offering to reveal to her up-to-date evidence
of a surveillance state in America presided over by the president
himself. It was what she had been searching for over the past three
years. How could she, as an activist filmmaker, resist such a sensa-
tional offer?

He further explained to her that he had placed great trust in her
discretion. “No one, not even my most trusted confidante, is aware
of my intentions, and it would not be fair for them to fall under sus-
picion for my actions,” he said.

Poitras must have found it flattering that a total stranger was
willing to disclose to her in e-mails what he would not tell even his
“most trusted confidante” about his intentions to commit an illicit

© breach of U.S. national security. It also put her under enormous ©
stress. She noted in her journal that the pressure made her feel as if
she were “underwater.” “I am battling with my nervous system. It
doesn’t let me rest or sleep. Eye twitches, clenched throat, and now
literally waiting to be raided.”

Snowden was also taking an extraordinary risk. After all, he had
no way of knowing who else she told about him. She had long been

ments could be attempting to entrap her. So Snowden could not pre-
clude the possibility that she would consult with others about the
offer he was making her. Because her current documentary project
included interviews by her with Assange, Appelbaum, and three ex-
NSA executives, intelligence services with sophisticated surveillance
capabilities might also have taken a professional interest in her com-
munications, as Poitras herself had suspected. Even if Snowden was
somehow able to use his position as a system administrator at Dell

before too long.

TB: What about Syria?

DP: Assad’s power is steadily diminishing and I cannot see how his
regime will remain long in power.

TB: Should the United States get involved there?

DP: No, Americans have no dog in this fight and nothing in the U.S.
Constitution requires us to get involved in every foreign conflict. Two
wretched forces are killing each other; just look at the ghastly videos of
the two sides torturing and executing the other. Listen also to what they
are saying. It’s a civil war involving the bad and the worse. I don’t want
the U.S. government involved. That would mean bearing some moral
responsibility for what emerges, which I expect to be very unsavory.

TB: So you are supporting the Obama position?

DP: Yes, though he reaches it with far more angst. Also, there appears to
be some serious, clandestine U.S. support for the rebel forces. The
September 11 meeting in Benghazi between the Turkish and the American
ambassadors was very curious. They are both based in Tripoli, hundreds
of miles away. What were they doing in Benghazi? Arranging for
American arms going via Turkey to Syria, 1t appears.

TB: How important has Israel been to the revival of Islam?

DP: It is a major factor in the neighboring states. But elsewhere, in
Morocco, Iran, Malaysia, it has minor importance.

TB: Since the “Arab Spring,” Israel seems increasingly beleaguered.
DP: Not really, not yet, though I agree that it will be more beleaguered
with time. Its neighbors are so consumed with their own affairs that they
hardly pay Israel attention. But once the neighbors get their houses in
order, Israel will most likely face new difficulties.

TB: You have questioned U.S. support for Islamic democracy, which
does seem naive.

graduates who leave family and friends
for the first time to attend college, on the
other hand, typically experience intense
feelings of social isolation even though
they are physically around more people
than before they left home. Caspi and
colleagues (23) found that perceived
social isolation in adolescence and
young adulthood predicted how many
cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., body
mass index, waist circumference, blood
pressure, cholesterol) were elevated in
young adulthood, and that the number of
developmental occasions (i.e.,
childhood, adolescence, young
adulthood) at which participants felt
socially isolated predicted the number of
elevated risk factors in young adulthood.

Perceived social isolation is
known more colloquially as loneliness,
which in early scientific investigations
was depicted as “a chronic distress
without redeeming features” (24, p. 15).
Loneliness may feel like a painfully
miserable, hopeless, and worthless state,
but we have found it has a specific
structure and a valuable adaptive
function.

Research on the ways in which
people describe themselves when asked
the question, “Who are you?”, reveals
three basic dimensions (25): (1) a
personal, or intimate, self, the “you” of
your individual characteristics; (2) a
social or relational self, which is who
you are in relation to the people closest
to you—your spouse, kids, friends, and
neighbors; and (3) a collective self, the
you that is the member of a certain
ethnic group, has a certain national
identity, belongs to certain professional
or other associations, and a member of
the fan club for certain sports teams.
Similar to the relational self, this part of
the self is social but what makes this self

Page |25

distinct is that these are broader social
identities, linked to larger social groups
rather than individual members of the
groups. When we examined the
dimensions underlying loneliness/social
connectedness, we found the same three
basic dimensions (26): (1) intimate
connection/isolation refers to the
perceived presence/absence of anyone in
your life who affirms you as a valued
person; (2) relational
connection/isolation refers to the
perceived presence/absence of quality
friendships or family connections; and
(3) collective connection/isolation refers
to the perceived presence/absence of a
meaningful connection with a group or
social stimulus (e.g., school, team)
beyond other individuals. When you
perceive you are part of a valued group
(collective connection), for instance, you
may be more inclined to agree with other
group members, even on beliefs that
may seem irrational, than when you are
thinking of yourself as a unique
individual.

Given that human survival and
prosperity depends on inclusion in and
participation with a social group,
especially in evolutionary time when
food was scarce and dangers were
common, there is an adaptive benefit to
having the strong and aversive response
of loneliness when an individual feels
his or her social connections might be
weakening or broken, just as there is a
benefit to having aversive signals for
other conditions critical for survival.
Hunger, thirst, and pain have evolved as
aversive signals to prompt an organism
to change their behavior in a way that
protects the individual and promotes the
likelihood their genes will make their
way into the gene pool. The social pain
of loneliness has evolved similarly — to
serve as a signal that one’s connections

many as possible of the Arab inhabitants to come under the authority of the
Palestinians, and as few as possible under our rule.” Amnon’s bottom line was that
we could not give up Israeli sovereignty over the Temple Mount, which, although
he was a non-observant Jew, he called “the cradle of Jewish history.” But equally,
we couldn’t and shouldn’t “run the Al-Aqsa mosque.” He was also in favor of
agreeing to what Clinton had asked of me: giving Arafat a base in the Muslim
Quarter of the Old City. His one caveat was that we should not do any of this
unless it was part of a genuine, final, peace agreement with the Palestinians.

Danny Yatom urged us to move beyond our emotions and look for a practical
solution. “We all know how the boundaries of Jerusalem were drawn,” he said,
referring to the post-1967 expansion of the city. “They’re not holy. It 1s important
to get down to our real red lines.” Eli Rubinstein, the attorney general, agreed.
Even though he was an observant, Orthodox Jew, and more sympathetic politically
to Likud than Labor, he concluded that we needed to include “as few Arabs as
possible” under Israeli sovereignty, and to cede the outer villages to the
Palestinians, adding: “This is a moment of truth.”

It was nearly five hours before I brought the discussion to a close. “This is as
grave a decision as when Ben-Gurion accepted the partition plan in 1947; the
declaration of the state; or the most tense moments of the Yom Kippur War,” I
said. “Or the decisions which Begin took in this same place.” Of course, Begin
hadn’t even been willing to enter into discussion on Jerusalem. But we were in a
different situation. If we were going to get a true end to our conflict, the question
of Jerusalem had to be addressed. “We can’t delay the decision. We can’t avoid it.
We will have to decide.” My own red line was the same as Amnon Lipkin’s:
“sovereignty over the site of our First and Second Temples.” Even shared
sovereignty elsewhere within the Old City seemed to me a step too far at this stage,
but I didn’t rule it out as part of a full peace. “Without disengagement from the
Palestinians, without an end of conflict,” I reminded our negotiating team, “we’re
heading toward further tragedy. We can’t pretend we don’t see the iceberg.”

I asked several members of the team, under Shlomo Ben-Ami, to draft a paper
based on our discussion. Since I knew that Clinton, and Arafat too, could do
nothing of substance until I'd resolved how far to go on Jerusalem, I went to see
the President. I told him about our session. I said that we were now crystallizing
what had been said into a formal position, and I hoped to be able to return in a few
hours with “the furthest point we can go.” Clinton said that would be a critical

arresting each others' children. Iran's nuclear programme appears to
proceed independent even of the organs of its own state.

A spoof article in the Economist last year portrayed Iran's supreme leader,
Ayatollah Khamenei, ruminating on western nations' obsessive posturing
towards his country. He mused that these were unstable, unreliable places,
dangerous though probably not all mad. But since it was hard to be sure, I
would feel a lot safer 1f we already had that bomb. Similar insecurity
drove sanctioned Cuba to accept Russian missiles in the 1960s, and
sanctioned Iraq and Libya to pretend to build weapons of mass destruction
in the 1990s.

Sanctions never stop bad things happening. Rather they entrench dictators,
build up siege economies and debilitate the urban middle class from which
opposition to dictatorship grows. As Khamenei said in a speech a year
ago, sanctions were painful ... but make us more self-reliant. Indeed, for
a regime to be sanctioned 1s to receive an elixir: witness Castro, Gaddafi,
the ayatollahs and the ruling cliques of Burma, Afghanistan and North
Korea. That sanctioned regimes sometimes come to an end is not proof
that sanctions work, rather that they take a long time and usually require
war to work.

This is a rarely researched topic because sanctions are diplomatic ideology
rather than science. A debate in 1998 in International Security magazine
saw the Chicago academic, Robert Pape, barely challenged in his view
that only around five of the 115 cases of sanctions imposed since the war
could claim any plausible efficacy. Most merely inflicted significant
human costs on the populations of target states, including on innocent
civilians who have little influence on their government's behaviour. They
are a ready invitation to war.

When I was reporting on South Africa in the 1980s I became convinced
that sanctions were aiding import substitution and benefiting the Afrikaner
economy, probably giving apartheid an extra decade of life. They likewise
prolonged Ian Smith's regime in Rhodesia. Sanctions made Libya's
Gaddafi so rich he could spoon money into the London School of

Psychologists and economists sometimes take this “norm” as given, without asking
where it comes from, and a naive reading of Trivers would lead one to think that we
should be sensitive to the magnitude of the initial favor and whether it is
manipulative.

However, according to the above model, reciprocity is the Nash equilibrium,
even if the favors are not evenly matched or manipulative, since, in equilibrium, we
are neither sensitive to such quantitative distinctions nor to whether the initial reci-
procity was manipulative, unless these facts are commonly known.

Self-Image Concerns. People sometimes play mental tricks in order to appear to
themselves as pro-social. For example, in an experiment, subjects will voluntarily take
on a boring task to save another subject from doing it, but if given the option of pri-
vately flipping a coin to determine who gets the task, they often flip—and flip, and flip
again—until the “coin” assigns the task to the other subject (Batson, Kobrynowicz,
Dinnerstein, Kampf, & Wilson, 1997). Why would we be able to fool ourselves and
not, say, recognize that we are gaming the coin flip? Why do we care what we think
of ourselves at all? Are there any constraints on how we will deceive ourselves?
Such self-image considerations can be explained by noting that our self-image can
act as a simple proxy, albeit an imperfect one, for what others think of us, and also that
we are more convincing to others when we believe something ourselves (Kurzban,
2012; Trivers, 2011). This explanation suggests that the ways we deceive ourselves
correspond to quirks described throughout this section—for example, we will absolve
ourselves of remaining strategically ignorant even when it is easy not to, or be con-
vinced that we have done good by voting, even if we cannot swing an election.

Framing Effects. Whether we contribute is highly dependent on the details of the
experiment, such as the choice set (List, 2007) and the labels for the different
choices (Ross & Ward, 1996; Roth, 1995). Such findings are often taken as evidence
that social preferences cannot be properly measured in the lab (Levitt & List, 2007).

We believe a more fruitful interpretation is simply that the frame influences
whether the laboratory experiment “turns on” our pro-social preferences, perhaps
by simulating a situation where cooperation is expected (Levitt & List, 2007).

One-Shot Anonymous Giving: We give in anonymous, one-shot settings, such as
dictator games. We also sacrifice for others in the real world when there is no chance
of reciprocation: Heroes jump on grenades to save their fellow soldiers or block the
door to a classroom with their bodies to prevent a school shooter from entering
(Rand & Epstein, 2014). This is often seen as evidence for a role of group selection
(Fehr & Fischbacher, 2003).

However, an alternate explanation is that we do not consider the likelihood of
reciprocation (Hoffman et al., 2015), as described above. To explain the laboratory
evidence, there are two more possibilities. First, subjects may believe there is some
chance their identity will be revealed and feel the costs of being revealed as selfish
are greater than the gains from the experiment (Delton, Krasnow, Cosmides, &
Tooby, 2011). Second, we again emphasize that learned or evolved preferences and
ideologies are expected to be applied even in novel settings to which they are not
optimized.

1Q17 investment thesis

Broad expectations of a pro-energy agenda from the incoming administration set a
theoretically constructive backdrop for the US oils. Along with the tailwind from
renewed OPEC support for oil prices, we view the broader energy sector as a
momentum play in the early part of 2017 where stock specific catalysts can re-emerge
to differentiate relative performance within the large cap US oils. We view Hess as the
most catalyst rich large cap US E&P for 2017 with a return to growth and
disproportionate exploration risk from a company with the highest cash margins in the
sector, second best balance sheet and significant oil leverage to our base case that is an
oil recovery in 2017. Hess remains amongst our top ideas in the US large cap oil sector
for 2017, and we retain our Buy rating, and $80 PO.

Deregulation / Gov't Legislation

While the potential for a less onerous regulatory backdrop, and greater access to Federal
lands for exploration and development, the majority of current activity remains
dominated by private lands thereby limiting any material changes arising froma
Republican administration. The exception is the potential for more receptive backdrop
for infrastructure development that can improve regional pricing through improved
access to takeaway capacity.

Tax Policy:

For the majority of the US E&P’s, changes in corporate tax rates have negligible impact
given that substantial net operating losses and deferred tax credits means that cash
taxes remain de minimis for the foreseeable future.

Catalysts:

News flow starts with an expected capex budget unchanged from 2016 at ~$2bn, the
company has stated it expects a return to drilling in the Bakken with a stated ramp up to
6 rigs from 2 currently returning the play to growth in 2017.. The first Guyana
development (Liza) expected to achieve FID by 2Q17 and which we expect to confirm
industry leading economics. Start-up of the first of two major developments — the North
Malay basin gas play in 3Q17, putting Hess back on a growth track and turning attention
to the Stampede start up in the US GoM in early 2Q18. In the background is an

the Palestinians after a transitional period. The part we had earmarked for
Palestinian control was now a bit over 85 percent of the West Bank, more than I’d
indicated to the President in our first meeting a year earlier. But while Abu Ala’a
had told Clinton he would ask for Arafat’s permission at least to negotiate, he
clearly hadn’t received it. He refused to talk about the map, or even respond to
Clinton’s suggestion that the Palestinians present a map of their own, until we did
two things: accept the principle of land swaps and reduce the size of the territory
we were suggesting for the settlement blocs. To Shlomo’s, and I’m sure even more
so to Abu Ala’a’s, astonishment, the President exploded. He told Abu Ala’a that to
refuse to provide any input or ideas was the very opposite of negotiation. It was an
“outrageous” approach. He stormed out.

It was late that evening when the first move toward the “make-or-break”
situation I had hoped for seemed to occur, though still with much more likelihood
of break than make. The President decided the only way to make progress was to
sequester a pair of negotiators from each side overnight. Their task would be to
search honesty for the outlines of a possible peace agreement. They were to update
Arafat and myself and then report to Clinton the next day. Then, we’d see where
we were. I agreed to send Shlomo and Gili Sher, my former “back-channel”
negotiators. I knew that whatever guidelines I gave them, they would probe beyond
them, just as they’d done in the back-channel talks. They were negotiators. They
were also smart, creative, badly wanted an agreement and, like me, believed it
ought to be possible. Though I would retain the final word to approve or reject
what they suggested, I knew that only in a legal sense could it be null and void. I
also recognized, however, that we had to be willing to push further, both to find
out for certain where the Palestinians stood and to convince the Americans we
genuinely wanted an agreement.

Shlomo and Gili left a little after midnight for Laurel Lodge. Marine guards
were posted at the doors, with orders that neither negotiating team was to leave
until morning without notifying the President’s staff. Mother Nature provided a
further incentive to stay inside, since it was again bucketing down with rain. The
negotiators talked not just through the night, but the next morning as well. It
wasn’t until early afternoon that Shlomo and Gili came to my cabin to report on
how they’d gone. As I'd anticipated, both of them had ventured beyond
concessions that I was ready to consider, at least at a ttme when we weren’t even
near to a final peace deal. Taking the President’s instructions to heart, they’d said

transported and consequently how and
where we worked and lived; Charles
Darwin who argued that the difference in
mind between humans and other species,
great as it is, is one of degree and not of
kind; and Albert Einstein who surmised
a relationship between energy and
matter, opening a universe of
possibilities that previously was virtually
unimaginable. As a result, the cultural
focus moved from a focus on the social
group — the family, neighborhood, or
society — toward the autonomous
individual.

Forty years ago, the dominant
metaphor for the human mind was the
digital computer, complete with inputs,
filing and memory systems, limited
processing resources, and outputs.
Evolutionary theory focused on the
selfish gene and, by extension, on the
individual whose purpose for living was
to survive long enough to reproduce.
Milton Friedman influenced economic
theory and government policies for
decades by positing that people, being
fundamentally rational, are motivated
first and foremost by self interests, and
the adage of “united we stand, divided
we fall” was supplanted by the notion
that what is best for the me is best for the
society. Moving from an economy
based on manufacturing for the masses
to one based on catering to idiosyncratic
consumer interests further fueled a focus
on the preferences of the autonomous
individual.

One can certainly find evidence
in humans and other species for the view
of life being best understood in terms of
self-interest. Sardines, for example,
swim in what appears to be synchronized
schools until approached by a predator,
at which time they dart about so
chaotically that they create what appears

Page |19

to be a large, tumultuous ball with a
mind of its own. The rule governing the
behavior of this dynamic and adaptive
collective action can be explained
entirely in terms of self-interests. Each
fish is driven to swim to the middle,
where it is less likely to be eaten by the
hungry predator. Sardines are born with
the capacity to swim, find food, and
avoid predators. If they survive long
enough to reproduce, their genes will be
part of the gene pool for future
generations. That is, if those who are
genetically predisposed to swim to the
middle are more likely to survive
predation, then the genetic
predisposition to swim to the middle will
become a characteristic of a larger
percentage of sardines in future
generations.

The sardine ball is an example of
a more general phenomenon, in which
the choices made by members of a group
endow the collective with properties that
are consistent, predictable, and
purposive enough that we can speak of
them as “behaviors” of the group, even
though the collective actions of the
group are not directed by any of the
individual members. This phenomenon
can be called “emergent,” because the
properties or behavior of the group are
not determined by any individual but
arises from the collective behaviors of
the individuals who constitute the group.
Social structures like the sardine ball
have evolved because the sardines
whose genes compelled them to swim to
the middle in the presence of predators
were more likely to survive to
reproduce, thereby contributing these
genes to this species’ gene pool.

According to the National
Science Foundation’s Tree of Life
project, there are anywhere between 5

Chapter 2: My Secular Education—Brooklyn and Yale

I loved everything about Brooklyn College. The inner city campus was green and lush. The
professors were phenomenal teachers—many of them en route to more elite universities. The
students, though mostly Jewish, seemed diverse to me because so few were Orthodox.
Intellectual and political debate filled the classrooms, the lunchrooms and the quad. No one said
“Meturneshed.” Every idea was acceptable (except, perhaps Communism, since the stench of
McCarthyism still hung in the air.)

I felt free to experiment with my thoughts and words, but not yet with my actions. I remained an
Orthodox Jew in practice and I did not try drugs or even alcohol. (I tried to try sex, but couldn’t
find any willing partners.)

My friends and I founded a “house plan” — an urban fraternity for students who lived at home
with our parents, as we all did. We called it “Knight House” and our boastful Latin slogan was
“semil equis satis’—“once a knight is enough.” Since we were all orthodox Jews, we could not
attend the usual Friday night parties, so our orthodox Jewish house plan had its parties on
Saturday or Sunday night. We were desperate to defy the stereotype of orthodox Jewish wimps,
so we worked hard on our athletic skills, ultimately winning the house-plan championship in
several sports. I still have newsclippings attesting to my athletic accomplishments: “Knight
soccer champs”—“AlI Dershowitz led the knighters to victory, scoring two large goals.”

In my senior year in college, a group of friends decided it was time to lose our collective
virginities. We heard that there was a special deal over Christmas vacation to travel to Havana,
then a wild city. We all went down to Florida in another friend’s old car and bought round trip
tickets to Havana for $59. We had the name of a house, which specialized in transitioning young
boys into men. We were scheduled to make the hour-long flight the day before the 1959 New
Year. We couldn’t wait to get to Havana, but a bearded guy named Fidel got there first and we
couldn’t make it. For years, I had been telling people that the flights were cancelled, but a couple
of summers ago I was at a party with a man (now married to a prominent public figure) who was
at Brooklyn College with me. He and several of his friends were also going to Havana for the
same reason. I had forgotten that the trip to Florida was actually sponsored by the Brooklyn
College Student Government. When I told him my story, he said, “I made it to Havana,” and I
said, “but the flights were cancelled.” He said, “No they weren’t. The State Department just
issued a warning that it was a little bit dangerous.” I guess he was more determined to lose it
than I was. His wife, who was then his college girlfriend, said that she didn’t “touch him for a
year after that.”

I took another trip with my college friends. It was to Washington D.C. On the day we arrived,
the king of Saudi Arabia was a state visitor. In his honor, green Saudi flags draped all of the
important federal buildings and monuments. When I saw the flag of that slave-owning dictator on
the Lincoln Monument, I got angry and tore it down. I was immediately taken into custody by a
park policeman. His superior was sympathetic, however, and let me go with a warning: “Next
time, make sure no one sees you when you tear down the rest of those damn flags.”

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018215.txt,"undergo serious reform. It is manifestly absurd that the West makes up 12
percent of the world’s population but takes up 60 percent of UN Security
Council permanent seats. It’s nonsensical that the head of the IMF is
always a European and the head of the World Bank is always an American
as the West’s share of global GDP diminishes every year. This
concentration of clout in the hands of a relative few has grave implications
for these institutions’ effectiveness and independence, making them
instruments of the West. No other organization, not even huge global
NGOs like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation or the Clinton
Foundation, has the scope and legitimacy that the UN currently enjoys.
For example, the United States for years has been trying to pressure China
to take a more proactive role in fighting climate change. Predictably,
China has resisted these pressures because they saw them as a clever yet
transparent American ruse to curtail Chinese economic growth. Only when
the United Nations Development Programme raised the issue with China
did the Chinese government take heed, as the UNDP is seen as a neutral
party in China. The UN and its many agencies may soon lose invaluable
credibility if the West insists on monopolizing its power over these
institutions.

Any reform of the UN should take into account three principles:
democracy, recognition of power balances and the rule of law. Institutions
of global governance can be made more democratic by ensuring that their
leadership accurately reflects the composition of world’s population. At
the same time, we must also take into account geopolitical relationships
among emerging and middle powers. Finally, the rule of law is essential to
the mediation and resolution of thorny international issues and to
governing the conduct of states on the international stage so as to prevent
escalation of conflict.

In this rapidly changing world, it’s a mistake to allow institutions of global
governance to stay as they are. The 1945 rules-based order is no longer
appropriate for 21st century circumstances. Global leaders must better
prepare us for the challenges to come and equip our international
organizations to deal with them. Leaders must find the courage to continue
advocating for stronger multilateral cooperation. It is time for our captains

others repeat such false and defamatory statements and thereby further damaged Giuffre’s
reputation.

33. | Maxwell made her statements to discredit Giuffre in close consultation with
Epstein. Maxwell made her statements knowing full well they were false.

34. | Maxwell made her statements maliciously as part of an effort to conceal sex
trafficking crimes committed around the world by Maxwell, Epstein and other powerful persons.

35. | Maxwell intended her false and defamatory statements set out above to be
broadcast around the world and to intimidate and silence Giuffre from making further efforts to
expose sex crimes committed by Maxwell, Epstein, and other powerful persons.

36. | Maxwell intended her false statements to be specific statements of fact, including
a statement that she had not recruited an underage Giuffre for Epstein’s abuse. Maxwell’s false
statements were broadcast around the world and were reasonably understood by those who heard
them to be specific factual claims by Maxwell that she had not helped Epstein recruit or sexually
abuse Giuffre and that Giuffre was a liar.

Shs On or about January 4, 2015, Maxwell continued her campaign to falsely and
maliciously discredit Giuffre. When a reporter on a Manhattan street asked Maxwell about
Giuffre’s allegations against Maxwell, she responded by saying: “I am referring to the statement
that we made.” The New York Daily News published a video of this response by Maxwell
indicating that she made her false statements on East 65 Street in Manhattan, New York, within

the Southern District of New York.

FBI: 'We still have a pending case' 
*. EPSTEIN from IB 
and Donald Trump among 
his friends. 
Highly unusual is how 
Palm Beach Police Chief Mi-
chael Reiter described State 
Attorney Barry Krischer's 
handling of the case in a 
bluntly critical letter to 
Krischer last year before 
Epstein was indicted. 
Reiter referred the mat-
`ter to the FBI to determine 
whether any federal laws had 
been violated. Epstein's allies 
countered by attacking the 
chief personally and profes-
sionally. 
Reiter's department in-
vestigated Epstein for 11 
months. Police sifted repeat-
edly through his trash and 
conducted surveillance on 
his five-bedroom, 71/2-bath, 
7,234-square-foot home on 
the Intracoastal Waterway. 
Police said Epstein paid 
women and girls as young 
as 14 to give him erotic mas-
sages at his home. Police 
thought there was probable 
cause to charge him with 
unlawful sex acts with a mi-
nor and lewd and lascivious 
molestation. 
(m Epstein responded by 
hiring a phalanx of lawyers. 
'One of them, Harvard law 
k professor and. author Alan 
Dershowitz, provided the 
I state attorney's office with 
information about alcohol 
el' and marijuana use by some 
of the girls who said they 
,K3 were with Epstein. 
4 Prosecutors then referred 
the case to the grand jury 
Teenage girls were 
recruited to visit 
Epstein for massages 
and sex, police hay. 
rather than fild charges di-
rectly against Epstein. 
Epstein's attorneys deny 
he had sex with underage 
girls. The lawyers say the 
girls' stories are not credible. 
But if the court file is any 
indicator, they've made no ef-
fort to depose the girls. 
Neither prosecutors nor 
defense attorneys have 
sought to question Robson, 
said Dutko, her attorney.,She 
recruited teenage girls to vis-
it Epstein for massages and 
sexual activity, Palm Beach 
police said, and presumably 
would be a key witness. 
Epstein's attorney Jack 
Goldberger did not return 
phone messages. 
A source close to the case 
suggested it is languishing 
pending a decision by the 
FBI on whether to refer it to 
federal prosecutors. 
We still have a pending 
case, FBI spokeswoman 
Judy Orihuela said Monday. 
State Attorney Krischer 
did not return a call for com-
ment His spokesman, Mike 
Edmondson, declined to say 
whether federal investiga-
tors are delaying the Epstein 
case. But, ,he added; if an-
other agency is looking at 
something, we wouldn't want 
to step on their toes. 
Attorneys say inertia in a 
criminal case often points to 
a pending plea deal. 
It would not surprise me 
if something has happened 
that's not reflected in the 
court file, said Dutko, such 
as an agreement that will be 
formalized later. 
Defense attorney Marc 
Shiner said defense at-
torneys sometimes put off 
overtly conducting discov-
ery — deposing witnesses, 
requesting documents and 
the like — because doing so, 
creates more work for har-
ried prosecutors who may 
become angry and not offer 
a plea deal. . 
Sometimes defense law-
yers, knowing that, will try 
and do discovery without 
taking depositions, said 
Shiner, a former prosecutor 
for 13 years. - 
Instead, they may conduct 
a below-the-radar probe such 
as having a private investiga-
tor check out leads, he said. 
Shiner and others say a 
plea deal for Epstein probably 
would result in pretrial inter-
vention, in which a defendant 
may be ordered to undergo 
a psychological evaluation, 
counseling or .other condi-
tions in return for dropping 
the charge. 
Edmondson, spokesman 
for State Attorney Krigeher, 
said there is no plea offer 
and no request for the pros-
ecution to show its cards. 
To my knowledge, it's 
never happened before on a 
filed case, he said.

UNITED STATES 
EXTRADITION TREATIES 
(January 1, 2006) 
Stewart C. Robinson 
Deputy Director 
Office of International Affairs 
United States Department of Justice 
International extradition is the formal process by which a person found in one country is 
surrendered to another country for trial or punishment. The process is regulated by treaty and 
conducted between the Federal Government of the United States and the government of a foreign 
country. It differs considerably from interstate rendition, commonly referred to as interstate 
extradition, mandated by the Constitution, Art. 4, Sec. 2. 
Below is a listing of extradition treaties signed by the United States. As indicated, not all 
of the treaties have entered into force as of the date this document was created. 
Please contact the Office of International Affairs, United States Department of Justice at (202) 
514-0000 to determine the status of a particular treaty. 
Over the last few years, the United States has focused its efforts on replacing extradition 
treaties that have become outdated and obsolete, as well negotiating treaties with first time treaty 
partners. Our most recent treaties include the dual criminalitif approach rather than a listing of 
offenses for which extradition may be sought, clarify the procedures for provisional arrest, permit 
extradition whether the extraditable offense occurred before or after the treaty enters into force, 
allow the person sought to waive extradition, and permit temporary transfer of a fugitive serving 
a sentence in one state in order to expedite prosecution in another. In our newer treaties, one of 
the priorities of the United States has been to address two extremely difficult problems: the 
extradition of nationals; and extradition where the fugitive may be subject to the death penalty in 
the Requesting state. Not all of our treaty partners have agreed to extradite under these 
circumstances, but the issue is specifically addressed. 
The treaties highlighted pending in boldface, are treaties which have not entered into 
force as of the date of this listing. The law of extradition varies from country to country and is 
subject to foreign policy considerations. The first step a prosecutor should take before 
considering any action relating to international extradition, is to contact the Office of 
International Affairs, United States Department of Justice, at (202) 514-0000.

series of events. In particular, the girls described how contact 
was made via telephone, primarily withI  
lat Epstein's 
home in Palm Beach. The girls would travel to Epstein's 
residence, usually in the company of another girl. The girls 
would enter Epstein's home via the kitchen, where they would be 
met by Epstein _________________. The girls would be escorted up to 
Epstein's bedroom where a massage table was accessible. The girls 
were told to undress - some undressed only partially and some 
undressed completely. Epstein would enter the room partially 
dressed, usually wearing only a towel. He would get onto the 
massage table face down. While lying face down, Epstein 
instructed the girl how to'massage him. After a period of time 
when! 
In addition to these sexual massages, some of the girls 
were paid additional sums to perform  more sexual activity, for  
example, engaging in sexual activity' 
'while Epstein watched. 
During the course of PBPD's investigation, a search 
warrant for Epstein's home was obtained and executed. Many of 
Epstein's belongings were removed from the home prior to the 
execution of the search warrant - for example, the computer 
processing units (CPUs) were removed from the house but the 
computer screens, keyboards, cords, etc. were left behind. The 
missing CPU's were never recovered. 
During the search, several telephone message pads were 
recovered. These message pads show messages taken from several of 
the girls who were interviewed and admitted to engaging in sexual 
massages or other sexual activity with Epstein. The messages 
contained text such as I have a female for him and has girl 
for tonight. Some of the messages from the girls were addressed 
to Epstein  and others were addressed' 
'Additional messages recovered during the search 
contained text confirming appointment times.

JEFFREY HERMAN, lawyer for parents of girl, now 17, who accuses Jeffrey Epstein of sexual assault 
Palm Beach man faces lawsuit in teen sex case 
By LARRY KELLER 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
WEST PALM BEACH — The parents of a 
teenage girl sued part-time Palm Beach resi-
dent Jeffrey Epstein for more than $50 million 
on Thursday, alleging that the wealthy money 
manager had her brought to his mansion for 
a massage, then engaged in sexual activity 
with her. 
The girl, identified only as Jane Doe, was 
14 at the time. She was the youngest of sev-
eral alleged victims of Epstein, according 
to Palm Beach police, who spent 11 months 
investigating him. 
The federal lawsuit, filed by Miami at-
* torney Jeffrey Herman, says Epstein has a 
sexual preference and obsession for under-
age minor girls. Epstein gained access to 
primarily disadvantaged minor girls in his 
home, sexually assaulted these -girls, and 
then gave them money. 
o Herman, who specializes in child sex 
abuse litigation, sued on behalf of the girl, 
her father and her stepmother on grounds 
of sexual assault, intentional infliction of 
. emotional distress and loss of parental con-
sortium. 
• . Jane Doe ... fell into Epstein 's trap and 
became one of his victims, the lawsuit says. 
We're dismayed by the filing of the law-
suit, but not surprised, said Jack Goldberger, 
qpne of Epstei4, attorneys. 'We think tWs 
shows what this case is all about: money. 
He and another Epstein attorney, Lilly Ann 
Sanchez, launched an immediate counterof-
fensive, even showing up at Herman's news 
conference outside the federal courthouse in 
West Palm Beach. They distributed copies of 
documents showing that the *ids father and

Jeffrey Epstein did not 
have sex with this woman, 
Sanchez said. 
Herman suggested that 
Epstein masturbated in front 
of the alleged victim and 
used a vibrator on her after 
she was brought to his home 
in February 2005. The girl is 
now 17. 
This was a typical 14-
year-old girl at the time she 
met Epstein, Herman said. 
What happened here was 
despicable. 
The girl told police inves-
tigators that she informed 
Epstein she was 18 when she 
met him, and she said that 
was her age on her Web page, 
Sanchez said. • 
The girl's father and step-
mother also attended the 
news conference. 
`We're very angry, the 
father said. It's not right that 
this wealthy man can fly into. 
town and destroy my daugh-
ter's innocence.' He did not 
take questions. 
Epstein, 55, is a mysteri-
ous New York money man-
ager who owns a Manhattan 
mansion, as well as homes 
in Palm Beach, New Mexico 
and the Virgin Islands. 
A Palm Beach County 
grand jury indicted him in 
July 2006 on one count ofi 
felony solicitation of prostitu-
tion stemming from alleged 
incidents between Aug. 1 and 
Oct. 31, 2005. 
Epstein is scheduled to 
enter a plea in the case on 
March 10, but 
he has post-
poned other 
court dates 
to resolve the 
case. 
'His in-
dictment 
followed an 
exhaustive 
investigation 
by the Palm Beach Police De-
partment, which concluded 
that Epstein paid underage 
girls and young women to be 
brought to his five-bedroom, 
71h-bath Intracoastal home for 
massages and sometimes sex 
play. Much of the language in 
the Jane Doe suit mirrors that 
of police.reports in the case. 
Herman's client said her 
meeting with Epstein was set 
up by Haley Robson of Loxa-
hatchee, who was a Palm 
Beach Community College 
student at the time. When 
Jane Doe arrived at Epstein's 
home, she was escorted by an 
Epstein assistant, Sarah Kel-
len, to a room with a massage 
table, police reports and the 
lawsuit say. 
Epstein walked in wear-
Epstein 
ing only a towel, removed it 
and lay naked on the mas-
sage-table, the lawsuit says. 
He demanded that Jane Doe 
remove her clothing, and she 
did, except for her under-
wear, the lawsuit alleges. The 
sexual activity followed, the 
suit says. 
Epstein paid her $300 af-
terward, and Robson got $200 
for bringing the girl to him, 
the lawsuit says. 
Robson and Kellen helped 
Epstein arrange other liai-
son5s with girls, Palm Beach 
police concluded. Neither 
was charged. 
This- is not the first time s 
Epstein has been sued. over 
purported activities with 
teenage girls. He was sued 
in New York in October by a 
woman who says she had sex 
with Epstein when she was 
16 and had sought his help in 
becoming a model. 
The lawsuit filed Thurs-
day also alleges that Epstein 
has assaulted girls on his 
private island in the Virgin 
Islands. Herman declined to 
elaborate on that assertion.

Part-time Palm Beadier 
faces another sex suit 
By LARRY KELLER 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
WEST PALM BEACH 
— For the second time in two 
weeks, part-time Palm Beach 
resident Jeffrey Epstein has 
been sued for more than 
$50 million by a woman who 
contends that he engaged 
in sexual activity with her 
when she was a minor after 
enticing her 
to give him 
a massage at 
his home.

the lawsuit alleges. She says

The two attended the same 
Palm Beach County high 
school. Jane Doe No. 2 is now

that Epstein, 55, targeted

perceived as less likely to

whose credibility would be

Both complaints are full of

one of Epstein's many attor-
neys. Jane Doe No. 2's lawsuit 
is an outrageous, defamatory 
copycat of the first 
There has been a twist in 
the first Jane Doe lawsuit. Her 
mother in Georgia contends 
that her former husband 
— Jane. Doe's father — con-
sulted with neither of them 
before filing the lawsuit She 
is asking a judge to halt the 
litigation until her daughter 
turns 18 in May and can make 
her own decisions. 
The mother asked in court 
filings to be added to the law-
suit, saying she has suffered 
and will continue to suffer 
severe mental anguish and 
pain as a result of Epstein's 
reckless conduct. 
Jane Doe just didn't'want 
the lawsuit • going forward 
with the father's involve-
ment, said Ted Leopold, 
the mother's attorney She 
wanted to pursue it on her 
own. The father essentially 
did this on his own. 
Jane Doe has • been es-
tranged from her father since 
Thanksgiving, Leopold said. 
That's why it's even stranger 
what he did, he said. 
The girl's mother is asking 
a judge in their divorce case 
to find the father in contempt 
of court for violating their 
divorce decree by not con-
ferring with her on a matter 
involving their daughter. 
The father has sole custo-
dy and has the right to make 
decisions on his daughter's 
rights, Herman said. 
Epstein is a wealthy New 
York money manager who 
has counted Bill Clinton, 
Donald Trump and Britain's 
Prince Andrew among his 
friends. He was the target of 
a lengthy investigation into 
his activities with girls by the 
Palm Beach Police Depart-
ment that resulted in his in-
dictment in July 2006 on one 
count of felony solicitation 
of prostitution. That case is 
pending. 
Epstein has been sued in 
New York by a woman who 
says he had sex with her 
when she was 16. Herman 
said he has received calls 
from others making the same 
assertions in that state. 
Herman convened a news 
conference Wednesday on 
the middle bridge connecting 
West Palm Beach and Palm 
Beach. 
This is the bridge ... these 
girls were recruited to come 
over and give a massage, he 
said. When they crossed this 
bridge, they had no idea what 
was in store for them, This is 
a bridge of tears. 
Herman has described 
both Jane Does as typical 
teenage girls Epstein robbed 
of their innocence. 
But Harvard University law 
Professor Alan Dershowitz, 
another Epstein attorney, pro-
vided the state attorney's of-
fice with information gleaned 
from the myspacekom Web 
site two years ago showing 
that some of Epstein's alleged 
victims boasted of their alco-
hol and marijuana use. 
Herman said the girls' 
backgrounds aren't relevant 
to Epstein's purported 'be-
havior They don't have the 
mental capacity to consent 
to something like this with a 
grown man, he said.

• The mother com-

father did not consult

leges sexual assault,

Epstein, 55, induced several under-

at his Intracoastal home, a Palm Beach 
Police Department investigation con-

Jane Doe's parents separated two ' 
months after she was born at Good Sa-

divorce has been contentious. Each has 
had primary custody of the girl at various 
times. 
The father pleaded guilty to. fed-
eral fraud charges in 2001 and was sen-
tenced to 21 months in federal prison, 
plus three years probation. The US.

Another suit alleges 
sex during massage 
By LARRY KELLER 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
WEST PALM BEACH 
— Another woman filed a 
federal lawsuit against Jef-
frey Epstein on Wednesday, 
• alleging that he turned a 
massage she gave him at his 
Palm Beach mansion into a 
sexual episode when she was 
16 years old. 
Identified as Jane Doe 
No. 3, she is seeking more 
than $50 million, the same 
as two other Jane Does who 
filed similar lawsuits in the 
past six weeks. All three Suits 
were filed by Miami lawyer 
Jeffrey Herman. 
Herman subsequently 
'withdrew the first Jane Doe's 
lawsuit because of squabbling 
by her parents over the litiga-
tion. The girl may refile the 
suit after she turns 18 in May 
and can make her own deci-
sions, Herman said. 
Other alleged victims also 
have contacted him, Herman 
said. I do anticipate more 
cases, he said. 
In the latest litigation, Jane 
Doe No. 3 alleges that she 
was recruited by a former col-
lege student, Haley Robson, 
to give Epstein a massage for 
money at his waterfront home 
late in 2004 or early in 2005. 
The lawsuit alleges that, 
while on the massage table, 
Epstein sexually touched 
Jane Doe No. 3, then mas-
turbated. She is suing on 
grounds of sexual assault and 
intentional infliction of emo-
tional distress. 
She felt intimidated. She 
felt scared, Herman said. 
Jane Doe No. 3 made only the 
one visit to Epstein's home, 
he said. 
It's just another copycat 
lawsuit filed by the same 
lawyer who appears less 
interested in the truth than 
in grandstanding with these 
press conferences, said Jack 
Goldberger, one of Epstein's 
attorneys. We now have 
sworn testimony that girls 
lied about their age to Jeffrey 
Epstein, and they were care-
ful in being convincing that . 
they were over the age of 18. 
Herman said Robson 
instructed Jane Doe No. 3, 
When he asks how old you 
are, tell him 18 or 19 years 
old. But he said it doesn't 
matter. They were underage 
girls, Herman said. They 
were sexually assaulted. 
In addition to the civil law-
suits, Epstein was indicted 
on a single count of felony 
solicitation of prostitution 
in July 2006 after a lengthy 
Palm Beach Police Depart-
ment investigation into his 
activities with underage girls 
dt his home. A resolution has 
been delayed continually. The 
case is on Monday's court 
docket but is expected to be 
rescheduled once again. 
One of the reasons (Jane 
Doe No. 3) came forward is 
she is tired of waiting for jus-
tice, Herman said.

Girl, sues Epstein, two others 
she says conspired in massages 
Jane Doe,' 1? sues in state court 
after dropping a federal suit. 
By LARRY KELLER 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
WEST PALM BEACH — A former Palm 
Beach Community College student who 
police say procured underage girls to give 
Jeffrey Epstein sexual massages at his Palm 
Beach mansion, and Epstein's personal assis-
tant have been sued along with Epstein over 
their alleged conduct. 
The girl behind the lawsuit was 14 years 
old when she contends he engaged in sexual 
conduct with her after she went to his water-
front home in 2005 to give him a massage. 
Her lawsuit, filed under the name Jane Doe, 
seeks unspecified damages from Epstein for 
sexual assault and intentional infliction of 
emotional distress. 
She also sued Epstein, Haley Robson of 
Loxahatchee and Sarah Kellen of New York 
City on grounds of conspiracy and civil rack-
eteering. 
We just want a full measure of justice for 
this girl, said her attorney, Ted Leopold. 
Robson, who attended Palm Beach Com-
munity College, was paid by Epstein to bring 
girls to his mansion for massages and more, 
according to Palm Beach police. I'm like a 
Heidi Fleiss, they said she told them. Her 
attorney could not be reached immediately 
for comment. 
Kellen was an Epstein personal assistant 
who arranged the encounters, even escort-
ling the girls to his massage room, police 
Epstein 
In,dexing: 
These two conspired With 
him to help with the criminal 
enterprise, Leopold said. 
Jane Doe, through her 
father and stepmother, filed 
a federal lawsuit against 
Epstein in January She dis-
missed it after her mother 
said she wasn't consulted 
about the litigation and 
sought to intervene. The 
mother is acting on her daughter's behalf in 
the latest lawsuit. 
Epstein's lawyer has denied the girl's al-
legations and said her family is simply at-
tempting to get money from a very rich man. 
Epstein, 55, is a Manhattan money manager 
who has homes there, in New Mexico and the 
Virgin Islands, in addition to his $8.5 million 
Palm. Beach mansion. 
Two other Jane Does have sued Epstein 
in federal court this year, making similar al-
legations to those of the first Jane Doe. Those 
cases remain active. 
Also pending against Epstein in state court 
is a felony charge of solicitation of prostitu-
tion arising from the same alleged incidents 
with several girls. That case is set for' trial in 
July, two years, after he was indicted. 
° Jane Doe's new lawsuit, filed in Palm Beach 
County Circuit Court, is the most explicit in 
detailing Epstein's alleged misconduct. It is 
the only suit to include Robson and Kellen 
as defendants, and the only one to make con-
spiracy and racketeering allegations. 
Jane Doe will turn 18 in May. She lives with 
other family members in Palm Beach County, 
is nearing graduation from high school and is 
working part time, Leopold said.

Palm 
Beacher 
pleads in 
sex case 
Jeffrey Epstein will 
serve 11/2 years on teen 
solicitation charges. 
By. LARRY KELLER 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
WEST PALM BEACH — He 
lives in a Palm Beach water-
front mansion and has kept 
company with the likes of 
President Clinton, Prince An-
drew and Donald Trump, but 
investment banker Jeffrey Ep-
stein will call the Palm Beach 
County Jail home for the next 
18 months. 
Epstein, 55, pleaded guilty 
Monday to felony solicitation 
of prostitution and procuring 
a person under the age of 18 
for prostitution. After serving 
18 months in jail, he will be 
under house arrest for a year. 
And he ,will have a lifelong 
obligation to register as a sex 
offender. He must submit to 
an HIV test within 48 hours, 
with the results being pro-
vided to his victims or their 
parents. 
As part of the plea deal, 
federal investigators agreed 
to drop their investigation 
of Epsteih, Which they had 
taken to a grand jury, two law 
enforcement sources said. 
. Epstein was indicted two 
years ago after an 11-month 
investigation by Palm Beach 
police: They received a 
complaint from a relative of 
a 14-year-old girl who had 
given Epstein a naked mas-
sage at his five-bedroom, 
7,234-square-foot, $8.5 million 
Intracoastal home.

'It's validation 
of what we're saying 
in the civil cases.' 
JEFFREY HERMAN 
Attorney who represents alleged 
victims, commenting on the plea 
The judge was skeptical but 
agreed to it. 
Epstein's legal woes don't 
end with Monday's plea. 
There are four pending fed-
eral civil lawsuits and one 
in state court related to his 
behavior. At least one woman 
has sued him in New York, 
where he owns a 51,000-
square-foot Manhattan man-
sion. 
It's validation of what 
we're saying in the civil 
cases, said Miami attorney 
Jeffrey Herman, who repre-
sents the alleged victims in 
the federal lawsuits. West 
Palm Beach attorney Ted 
Leopold represents one al-
leged victim in a civil suit in 
state court. He said he antici-
pates amending that lawsuit 
to add a few other clients 
as well. 
In the criminal case, po-
lice went so far as to scour 
Epstein's trash and conduct 
surveillance at Palm Beach 
International Airport, where 
they watched for his private 
jet so they would know when 
he was in town. They con-
cluded that Epstein paid girls 
$200 to $300 each after the 
massage sessions. 
I'm like a Heidi Fleiss, 
Haley Robson, now 22, told 
police about her efforts in 
recruiting girls for Epstein. 
There was probable cause 
to chaise Epstein with un-
lawful sex acts with .a minor 
and lewd and lascivious mo-
lestation, police concluded. 
The state attorney's of-
fice said questions about 
the girls' credibility led it to 
take the unprecedented step 
of presenting the evidence 
against Epstein to a grand 
jury rather than directly 
charging him. 
Palm Beach Police Chief 
Michael Reiter was furious 
with State Attorney Barry 
Krischer, saying in a May 
2006 letter that the prosecu-
tor should disqualify himself. 
I continue to find your 
office's treatment of these 
cases highly unusual, he 
wrote. He then asked for and 
got a federal investigation. 
Epstein hired a phalanx of 
high-priced lawyers — includ-
ing Harvard law professor 
and author Alan Dershowitz 
— and public relations people 
who questioned Reiter's com-
petence and the victims' 
truthfulness. 
In addition to mansions 
in Palm Beach and Manhat-
tan, Epstein owns homes in 
New Mexico and the Virgin 
Islands. He's a frequent con-
tributor to Democratic Party 
candidates. He also donated 
$30 million to Harvard in 
2003. 
Former New York Gov. 
Eliot Spitzer returned a 
$50,000 campaign contribu-
tion from Epstein after his 
indictment, then resigned 
this year during his own sex 
scandal. And the same Palm 
Beach Police Department 
that vigorously investigated 
Epstein returned his $90,000 
donation for the purchase of 
a firearms simulator.

Jeffrey Epstein. (left) appears in court Monday. Soon after he was charged two years ago, Epstein reject-
ed a deal that would have given him five years' probation and no criminal record, documents show.

Edition: Palm Beach Post 
Rich man fought the law 
and he mostly won 
Two years after a grand jury 
indicted him on a felony charge of 
solicitation of prostitution, Jeffrey 
Epstein finally admitted that he 
lured a teenage girl to his $8.5 mil-
lion, 13,000-square-foot Palm Beach 
mansion for sex. A week ago, the 
.55-year-old investment banker be-
gan serVing 18 months in jail. 
But that plea deal — guilty of 
felony solicitation of prostitution 
and procuring a person under the 
age of 18 for prostitution — does 
not account for all five of the girls, 
one as young as 14, who alleged that 
 Epstein sexually abused them. And 
why is Epstein serving his 
term in the overcrowded 
Palm Beach County Jail 
and not a state prison, 
where inmates are sent if 
their sentences are longer 
than one year? 
The slow, dissatisfy-
ing resolution of the case 
sends a message to the 
public that there's a dif-
ferent system of justice for 
the wealthy who hire high-powered 
lawyers. Epstein's legal team includ-
ed West Palm Beach defense attor-
ney Jack Goldberger, Harvard Law 
School Professor Alan Dershowitz, 
who defended 0.J. Simpson against 
murder charges, and Kenneth 
Starr, the prosecutor who pursued 
then-President Bill Clinton for lying 
about sex with young women. 
Palm Beach police spent 11 
months investigating Epstein be-
fore State Attorney Barry Krischer 
sent the case to a grand jury in-
stead of charging Epstein so the 
man who once boasted of accepting 
c;nly billionaire clients could face a 
trial. The police had taken a high 
school transcript, class schedules 
and phone messages from Epstein's 
Why is Jeffrey Epstein in 
jail, and not prison? 
home that showed he knew the girls 
were underage. Yet Mr. Krischer 
was more swayed by Epstein 's law-
yers, who attempted to impugn the 
girls' character by showing they 
had chatted on myspace.com about 
smoking marijuana and drinking. 
He should have let a jury decide 
whether the victims — and Epstein 
— were credible. 
Ultimately, one charge against 
Epstein finally reflected 
the age of one victim, and 
the plea agreement left 
Epstein labeled a sex of-
fender. With that additional 
charge, if Epstein had been 
convicted at a trial, he 
could have been sentenced 
to anything from probation 
to 15 years in prison, Assis-
tant State Attorney Lanna 
Belohlavek said, adding that the 
recommended guideline sentence 
was 21 months. 
Epstein also won't have to cer-
tify to the court that he is receiv-
ing counseling, typically required 
of sex offenders, because he has 
a private psychiatrist But without 
court supervision, who will ensure 
Epstein is in fact being treated? 
The plea deal also drops a federal 
investigation of Epstein. If a federal 
investigation was warranted, how 
does dropping it before completion 
benefit the public? 
Epstein preyed on girls and de-
nied it. For three years, his wealth 
and the influence of his lawyers 
bought him the protection the state 
attorney owed to the victims.

THREE young women suing billionaire Jeffrey Epstein for sex abuse 
at his Palm Beach mansion want a federal judge to quash the plea 
deal he made with the state of Florida to serve 18 months in jail in 
exchange for admitting he solicited a 14-year-old hooker. Their 
lawyer, Brad Edwards, has asked US District Judge Kenneth Marra 
to toss the deal - which included an agreement that Epstein's wouldn't 
face federal prosecution, which could have led to a longer jail term - 
because they weren't consulted on it. Marra has asked for more 
information before he rules. Epstein's rep, Howard Ruben stein, 
said, The lawsuit has absolutely no merit. They're just looking for 
money. These women have lied repeatedly, and in no way shape or 
form were they victims. They were at his place freely and voluntarily. 
And one of them showed Epstein a fake ID.

AS A CRIME VICTIM, YOU HAVE THE 
FOLLOWING RIGHTS under 
18 United States Code, Section 3771: 
The right to be reasonably protected from the 
accused; 
O The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of 
any public court proceeding, or any parole 
proceeding, involving the crime or of any release or 
escape of the accused; 
cp The right not to be excluded from any such public 
court proceeding, unless the court, after reviewing 
clear and convincing evidence, determines that 
testimony by the victim would be materially altered if 
the victim heard other testimony at that proceeding; 
The right to be reasonably heard at any public 
proceeding in the district court involving the release, 
plea, sentencing, or any parole proceeding; 
• The right to confer with the attorney for the 
Government in the case; 
• The right to full and timely restitution as provided in 
law; 
O The right to proceedings free from unreasonable 
delay; 
G The right to be treated with fairness and with respect 
for the victim's dignity and privacy. 
We will make our best efforts to ensure you are 
afforded the rights described. Most of these rights 
pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an 
individual for the crime, and it will be the responsibility 
of the prosecuting United States Attorney's Office to 
ensure you are afforded those rights. You may also 
seek the advice of a private attorney with respect to 
these rights. 
IF YOU ARE THREATENED OR HARASSED 
Your safety is paramount. If anyone threatens you or you feel 
that you are being harassed because of your cooperation with 
this investigation, there are available remedies. If you are 
in immediate danger, contact your local law enforcement 
agency mmediately. Also, you should contact your Victim

situation. There are penalties for harassment and other 
threats; therefore, it is important that you report any 
incident as soon as possible. 
IF YOU NEED FINANCIAL HELP OR 
SUPPORT SERVICES 
All states have crime victims compensation programs 
that help cover some expenses resulting from violent crimes. 
Your state program may pay for medical and mental health 
care costs, lost wages and support, and funeral and burial 
expenses not covered by insurance or other benefits. Your 
FBI Victim Specialist may be able to help intercede on your 
behalf with employers and creditors, when appropriate. In 
addition, your Victim Specialist can refer you to other types of 
programs and services, such as emergency housing, 
counseling, support groups, and credit counseling. If the 
offender is convicted or pleads guilty, the court may order 
payment by the offender, called restitution, which may help 
cover expenses and losses caused by your victimization. 
IF YOUR PROPERTY WAS STOLEN OR 
HELD AS EVIDENCE 
If your property was stolen, we hope 
WI 
to recover it as part of our 
investigation and return it as soon 
as possible. If your property is held 
as evidence, we will notify you, 
maintain it in good condition, 
and make every effort to see 
that it is returned to you as quickly 
as possible when it is no longer 
needed as evidence. 
Please understand that some property we receive as 
evidence has been damaged during the course of the crime. 
IF AN ARREST IS MADE 
Every effort will be made to notify you if a suspect is 
apprehended. If criminal charges are filed, you will be 
contacted by the United States Attorney's Office (USA0) 
assigned to handle your case. 
Each USA° has a Victim Witness Coordinator 
to help answer your questions and deal with 
your concerns during the prosecution of the 
case.

Introduction 
The Department of Justice and the United States 
Postal Inspection Service are committed to ensuring 
that victims of federal crime are treated fairly as their 
case moves through the criminal justice system. 
In order to provide victims with information on case 
events, the Department of Justice has developed the 
Victim Notification System (VNS). This brochure 
provides information about VNS. 
Victim Notification System (VNS) 
VNS is a cooperative effort between the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the United States 
Postal Inspection Service (USPIS), the United States 
Attorneys' Offices, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons 
(BOP). 
This free, computer-based system provides important 
information to victims. In many cases you will 
receive letters generated through VNS containing 
information about the events pertaining to your case 
and/or any defendants in the case. 
This information is also available in English and 
Spanish on the Internet and through a toll-free 
telephone number (Call Center). In cases with many 
victims, you may receive only one letter and then be 
directed to the Internet or Call Center for further 
information. 
VNS Information

using your telephone. You may write those numbers 
on the attached tear-off card to keep with you. 
If you have chosen to participate in VNS, but have 
not received these numbers, please contact either the 
FBI, the USPIS, or U.S. Attorney's Office handling 
your case.

ing with Packer naked in a sauna so he could be sure Packer did not
have a recording device (other than his notebook). Appelbaum stated
repeatedly in interviews that he was being spied upon by America.
While his claims might have sounded paranoid to his interview-
ers, as a character in Joseph Heller’s Catch-22 famously said, “Just
because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean they aren’t after you.”

Runa Sandvik, a close associate of Appelbaum’s, also worked
tirelessly to extend Tor’s cloak of anonymity in the private sector
against the surveillance of the NSA and other would-be intruders
of privacy. A Norwegian national in her mid-twenties, she wrote a
well-followed blog on Internet privacy for Forbes in 2012, in which
she identified herself as a privacy and security researcher working
at the intersection of technology, law, and policy. Appelbaum and
Sandvik both came in contact with Snowden before he went public
and while he was still working for the NSA in Hawaii.

In 2012, Snowden become involved in the effort to encourage
the use of Tor software to protect privacy. He made no secret of his
concerns about electronic interceptions. According to an anony-

© mous co-worker, he even wore a jacket to work with a parody of the ©
NSA insignia, which, instead of merely depicting the NSA eagle,
showed the eagle clutching AT&T phone lines. He had also become
a member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the digital rights
organization that was helping finance Tor. He saw Tor software as a
remedy. “Without Tor,” he later wrote, “when you walk the streets
of the Internet, you're always watched.” His efforts on behalf of Tor
were not limited to symbolic gestures. In 2012, he set up a two-
gigabyte server called “The Signal,” which he described as the larg-
est Tor relay station exit node in Honolulu. He apparently paid for
it himself.

Through his work as a system administrator for Dell, he found
documents revealing NSA efforts, not yet successful, to defeat Tor’s
ability to camouflage a user’s identity on the Internet. He found that
the NSA was attempting to build backdoor entry ways into Tor soft-
ware. One of the NSA documents that he illicitly downloaded, titled
“Tor Stinks,” described the agency’s continuing efforts to penetrate
Tor servers. In addition, he downloaded NSA documents describing
programs begun in 2012 that aimed at searching the Internet for the

Do you know what the Most Innovative Location Device is?

No it’s not a compass or an astrolabe. It’s not semaphore or a smoke signal. Not an RFID tag or a
neon sign or phosphorous flare either.

Give up?

It’s the GPS Smart Shoe™ recently mentioned in Forbes Magazine, developed by GTX Corp
(OTCBB: GTXO.OB) and licensed to Aetrex Worldwide. Yes, a shoe...well a very smart shoe as
it can tell a caregiver the precise location, bearing, history, speed and altitude of an Alzheimer’s
victim that has eloped or wandered. No small feat — pun intended — to reduce the overwhelming
stress on the millions of victim caregivers while potentially saving thousands from injuries and
death owing to exposure, accidents and criminal activity. The GPS Shoe also reduces the
manpower drain on municipal services; fire, police and welfare agencies often enlisted to locate
the mentally ill.

While a Finalist in the Most Innovative Location Device category of the Locations & Beyond
Summit and the People’s Choice Awards is a wonderful acknowledgment for the years GTXO
invested in developing the solution and the promise that Aetrex has made in bringing the Shoe to
market... the real winners are those touched by this devastating disease for which there is no cure,

but now have a new measure of hope.

victims’ rights. In their view, such statutes frequently fail to provide meaningful protection whenever they come into conflict
with bureaucratic habit, traditional indifference, [or] sheer inertia. 7° As the Justice Department reported:

Efforts to secure victims’ rights through means other than a constitutional amendment have proved less than fully adequate.
Victims’ rights advocates have sought reforms at the state level for the past twenty years, and many states have responded with
state statutes and [*868] constitutional provisions that seek to guarantee victims' rights. However, these efforts have failed to
fully safeguard victims’ rights. These significant state efforts simply are not sufficiently consistent, comprehensive, or
authoritative to safeguard victims’ rights. *?

To place victims’ rights in the constitution, victims advocates (led most prominently by the National Victims Constitutional
Amendment Network 3°) approached the President and Congress about a federal amendment. 3' In April 22, 1996, Senators
Kyl and Feinstein introduced a federal victims’ rights amendment with the backing of President Clinton. 3? The intent of the
amendment was to restore, preserve, and protect, as a matter of right for the victims of violent crimes, the practice of victim
participation in the administration of criminal justice that was the birthright of every American at the founding of our Nation.
33 A companion resolution was introduced in the House of Representatives. *4 The proposed amendment embodied seven core
principles: (1) the right to notice of proceedings, (2) the right to be present, (3) the right to be heard, (4) the right to notice of
the defendant's release or escape, (5) the right to restitution, (6) the right to a speedy trial, and (7) the right to reasonable
protection. In a later resolution, an eighth principle was added: standing. 3°

The amendment failed to pass in the 104th Congress. On January 21, 1997, the opening day of the first session of the 105th
Congress, Senators Kyl and Feinstein reintroduced the amendment. *° A series of hearings were held that year in both the
House and the Senate. *7 Responding to some of the concerns raised in these hearings, the amendment was reintroduced the
following year. 38 The Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings *° and passed the proposed amendment. * However, the
full Senate did not consider the amendment. In 1999, Senators Kyl [*869] and Feinstein again proposed the amendment. +!
On September 30, 1999, the Judiciary Committee again voted to send the amendment to the full Senate. ** But on April 27,

teachers always seemed able to answer my questions or help me find the
answers myself. I liked the school enormously. I might well have gone on to
finish my secondary education there. I probably should have. But the next year,
the kibbutz brought us back again.

One of the considerations was financial. Like many kibbutzim, Mishmar
Hasharon concluded that in order to make its school more economically
sustainable it would take in a number of “outside children” — yeldei chutz —
from towns and settlements around Israel. Yet this latest policy change was also
triggered a debate over the kind of education kibbutzim should provide. Should
a kibbutz school offer a curriculum tailored to passing the bagrut, the
matriculation exam, and going on to university? Or should it limit itself to a
fairly basic education geared to developing the talents needed for a productive
life on the kibbutz? In a series of heated debates in the dining hall, almost all of
Mishmar Hasharon supported the model of a basic, kibbutz-oriented education.

My father was the leading voice among the dissenters, and though it seemed
obvious he was fighting an uphill battle, I remember feeling a sense of pride at
watching him — and an echo in my own impulse to reach my own judgment
about issues and to act on it as | was growing older. Not only was he opposed to
the new policy. He was aghast. In the only time I can recall his speaking out at
one of the weekly kibbutz meetings, he asked how Mishmar Hasharon could
take upon itself the right to constrain an individual child’s life potential. “We
are Jews!” he said. “We are people who have left our impact on history through
our scholars, not our peasants. I can’t understand how we, who came here to
open a new chapter in the history of our people, can choose to keep our sons
and daughters from studying. We should encourage them to study!” He
accepted that the interests of the kibbutz mattered. But what kind of “model
society” would we be creating if we chose to “doom our own children to
ignorance, and cut them off from the great forward momentum of history in
Israel and the whole world?”

Especially in a kibbutz, however, the majority ruled. In this case, it was
nearly unanimous, my mother included. I could see she felt torn, whether
because she agreed with my father or because she realized how deeply he felt.
But she accepted the decision. For her, that was what was meant by being part
of the larger kibbutz family. Still, my father didn’t give up. He couldn’t change
the kibbutz’s ruling. But he tried to get me to stay at the regional high school. A
couple of years earlier, examiners had fanned out across Israel to administer its

FDA has found the drug to be a safe and effective treatment; however, most FDA-approved drugs can
be prescribed by doctors to treat other conditions (so-called “off-label” prescriptions).

Nonprescription or over-the-counter drugs can be marketed after receiving FDA approval through
the NDA process or by conforming the drug to an existing over-the-counter “monograph” (a “recipe
book” indicating acceptable ingredients, doses, formulations and labeling) established by the FDA.

Cannabinoid-Based Drugs

Several drugs containing synthetic cannabinoids or cannabinoid-like compounds have been approved
by the FDA. Marinol, a drug comprised of dronabinol (a synthetic THC) encapsulated with sesame oil
in a soft gelatin capsule, was approved by the FDA in 1985 for treatment of nausea and vomiting asso-
ciated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional
antiemetic treatments. It was later approved, in 1992, for treatment of anorexia associated with weight
loss in patients with AIDS. Syndros, a drug comprised of dronabinol in a liquid solution, was approved
by the FDA in 2016 for treatment of the same symptoms for which Marinol was approved. Cesamet,
a drug comprised of encapsulated nabilone (a synthetic cannabinoid similar to THC), was approved
by the FDA in 1985 for treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in
patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments.

Each of the drugs Marinol, Syndros and Cesamet was placed on CSA Schedule II within one to
two years after its initial FDA approval (Marinol and Syndros were rescheduled from Schedule I upon
recommendation of the DHHS, and Cesamet’s placement on Schedule II was its initial CSA classifica-
tion). Schedule II through Schedule V substances can be prescribed by a doctor, but the CSA does not
permit prescriptions for Schedule I substances, so removal of an FDA-approved drug from Schedule I
is required before the drug can be prescribed legally.

The FDA has not approved any drug derived from the cannabis plant. However, two such drugs,
Sativex and Epidiolex (both manufactured by U.K.-based GW Pharmaceuticals), have advanced
through certain stages of the FDA approval process. Sativex is a mouth spray used for treatment of
spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis; it includes THC and CBD derived from cannabis. Epidiolex
is an oral formulation of cannabis-derived CBD intended to treat severe forms of childhood epilepsy.
Human clinical trials have been conducted with both drugs, and although an NDA has not been sub-
mitted for Sativex, an NDA for Epidiolex was submitted to the FDA in October 2017. If approved by
the FDA, Epidiolex would be the first FDA-approved pharmaceutical derived from cannabis.

Foods and Dietary Supplements

Generally, the FD&C Act defines “food” as (i) any article used for food or drink for humans or animals,
(ii) chewing gum, and (iii) any article used as a component of any of the foregoing. The FD&C Act
defines a “dietary supplement” generally as either (i) a product intended to supplement the diet that
contains certain dietary ingredients (including vitamins, minerals, herbs, botanicals, amino acids, or
other substances used by humans to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake) or (ii) a
product intended for ingestion in tablet, capsule, powder, softgel, gelcap, or liquid form and labeled as

Some may argue that China is clearly adopting a more assertive policy in
East Asia — using the South China Sea, the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands
dispute, or the Air Defense Identification Zone as examples. However,
there is a difference, and this has to do with the “sphere of influence” of
China and, more specifically, with the sovereignty and integrity of
Chinese national territory (as Beijing defines it). For the CCP, the Syrian
crisis is a “pure” foreign policy issue, as the Chinese government has no
territorial claim in Syria or in the Middle East in general. On the other
hand, Beijing has always considered the South China Sea and the
Senkaku/Diaoyu islands as part of its sphere of influence and by
vigorously defending its claims on those territorial disputes, the CCP
purports to do nothing but protect its territorial integrity. It’s arguable that
this concern with territory has been the very first priority of China
throughout its history. The debate over the East China Sea ADIZ, which
China established in November, can also be related to the territorial
integrity of the Middle Kingdom. However, Western criticisms should be
balanced against the knowledge that the ADIZ is an American invention
(1950), which South Korea (1951) and Japan (1969) adopted long before
China did. At any rate, the South China Sea, the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands,
and the ADIZ issues are domestic issues for the CCP, rather than “pure”
foreign policy matters.

This article doesn’t seek to take a normative position. Rather, the point is
that in the Syrian crisis China has followed a consistent foreign policy, in
line with its principles and traditions. The outcome of this policy may not
satisfy many Western actors, but that is not enough to accuse China of
following a more assertive foreign policy toward Western powers and the
U.S. in particular. Of course, the new status of China in the international
community allows it to make its voice heard, instead of the silence that
may have prevailed before its economic arrival. But the considerations of
the CCP as it formulates its foreign policy have remained the same since
the creation of the PRC. In the future, China is likely to be more capable
of achieving its goals in its “domestic” Northeast Asian claims, but there

Syrians. Then to Geneva to see Assad, “where I felt like a wooden Indian, doing
your bidding. I will not let it happen here. I will simply not do it.”

I tried to keep my voice steady when I replied. I explained that the issues we
were addressing went to the heart of Israel’s interests, its future security, its
identity and definition as a nation. I had a responsibility to tread carefully. Then,
my voice rising too, I came back to what I felt was the real problem. Arafat and his
negotiators had been sitting and waiting for me and my team, and probably Clinton
as well, to deliver more and more concessions with no sign that they were willing
to move on anything. “I find that outrageous,” I said. I did not expect Arafat to
respond with equal concessions. After all, Israel had most of the tangible assets.
“But I did expect him at least to take a small step once we had taken ten. We have
not seen even this. This is the kind of behavior parents would not tolerate in their
own children! We don’t expect Arafat to accept this, but I do expect him to present
a counter-position.”

Clinton remained adamant he couldn’t go to Arafat with a retreat from our
earlier ideas. “My negotiating team moved beyond my red lines,” I told him. The
overnight talks were supposed to be non-binding and assumed that both sides
would make a genuine attempt to get an agreement. “I can’t see any change in
Arafat’s pattern. We take all the risks.” I said I doubted that Arafat expected to
hear that we had decided to “give him Jerusalem.” In any case, the Israeli public
hadn’t given me a mandate to do that. But I would still move in Arafat’s direction,
if and when I got any sign he was willing to do the same.

The President’s anger eased. He suggested he caucus with his negotiators and
figure out what to do next. I felt bad about what had happened: not about the list of
questions, or my insistence that we could not offer major concessions with no sign
of reciprocity. But I did regret that it had left the Americans so frustrated, and
Clinton so angry. He had invested not just huge amounts of time and brainpower,
but political capital, in the search for peace.

He phoned me at about 3:30 in the morning and asked me to come back. This
time, I went alone. We sat on the terrace of Aspen. He said again he couldn’t go to
Arafat with the list we’d drawn up. But having met with his negotiators, he
suggested they draft a more forthcoming list of their own — consistent with what
Shlomo and Gili had proposed. I agreed, as long as they kept in mind that it had to
be something I could ultimately live with, and that it be presented to Arafat as an

Omitted was the historical fact that Lee Kuan Yew was the only noncommunist
leader who in the late 1950s and early 1960s went into a CCP-backed United Front
organization and emerged the victor. That drew a red line, which provided the basis on
which Lee and his successors developed Singapore’s relations with China. Also ignored
was the fact that even though Singapore has no territorial claims on the SCS, that does
not mean it has no interest there. And, most crucial of all, although the majority of
Singaporeans are ethnic Chinese, Singapore is a multiracial country organized on the
basis of meritocracy and it does not view itself as a mono-racial state like China.

Still, many Singaporeans, only cursorily interested in international affairs, did

not realize they were being fed oversimplifications and swallowed them, or played
along for other reasons. Businessmen, academics, and others with interests in China
were given broad hints that their interests might suffer unless Singapore was more
accommodating, and they passed the messages to the Singapore government. The Belt
and Road Initiative was dangled as bait and the possibility of being excluded loomed
as a threat, even though Singapore, as a highly developed country, did not need BRI
infrastructure. Communist Party chairman Xi Jinping himself had asked Singapore
to start a BRI-related project in Chongqing. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was
pointedly not invited to the BRI Summit held in Beijing in 2017, although Singapore
was represented at a lower level. Appeals to ethnic pride were made to yet others.

The operation was effective. The pressures on the government were great. It was
difficult to explain the nuances of the SCS issue or Singapore’s relations with China to
the general public.

Then Beijing went too far. In November 2016, nine Singapore armored personnel
carriers (APCs) en route home from an overseas military exercise were seized by China
on the flimsiest of excuses.” Singaporeans immediately understood that this was naked
intimidation. Even the leader of the opposition Workers’ Party criticized China in
Parliament. Beijing, by then increasingly concerned with the Trump administration,
decided to settle. In January 2017, the APCs were released. The influence apparatus
gradually stood down and relations returned to normal. Chinese leaders went out of
their way to project friendliness. In late 2017, when news of Prime Minister Lee Hsien
Loong being invited to the White House by President Trump became public, the prime
minister was hastily invited to come to Beijing first, where he was received by Xi and
other senior Chinese leaders.

Academia

Most of the means by which the Chinese narratives were spread in 2016-17 were not
illegal. However, in August 2017, Huang Jing, an academic born in China who was

Electron Capital Partners, LLC
Global Utility White Paper
CONFIDENTIAL
1. Executive Summary
This White Paper discusses Electron Capital’s (“Electron”) views on the global utility sector and outlines why
now is a particularly advantageous time for long/short investing in the sector using Electron’s research
approach that focuses on structural change.
Electron’s 5 investment professionals, working together an average of 6 years, have generated a 7‐year track
record of long/short investing in the global utility sector. Returns have annualized 10.3% and have been
characterized by strong alpha generation (80% of returns; Jensen’s alpha calculation) in a dismally‐performing
global sector (‐0.2% absolute).
Electron will continue its approach with the Electron Global Fund, an absolute return product. (See
Appendices 1 and 2 for Electron’s process and the sector’s history.)
Electron invests in a deep universe of utility and infrastructure stocks, comprising 375 companies with a
market cap of $2.8 trillion. Our approach is truly global as 40‐60% of the portfolio’s historical gross has been
allocated outside the US. Stocks covered include the electric, gas, water and waste utilities in addition to
infrastructure companies (defined as those levered to utilities or utility‐like). For the sake of simplicity, the
rest of this White Paper will focus on the electric utilities, the largest subsector; we refer to this subsector
when we reference “utility”.
� Advantageous time to be long/short investing in the global utility sector (Section 2).
o Structural change in the sector has been accelerating after a recession‐induced slowdown.
o Long‐only investors are not positioned for such structural change in what is the world’s most
underweight sector.
o We believe hedge fund investors have already begun to make this turn as evidenced by a
significant increase in net exposure over the last 6 months.
� Structural changes will drive the largest alpha opportunities in all major regions (Section 3).
o US utilities will face the strongest headwinds, yet structural change will occur which will drive
alpha opportunities. We believe the most interesting US structural changes will have a magnified
effect internationally given commodity interlinkages.
o European and Asian utilities offer the most abundant and attractive alpha opportunities.
o Japan and Latam will be more trading markets over the near term.
� Some structural changes will have a global impact (Section 4).
o The shale gas and coal price washout (with its knock‐on effect on global power prices) is largely
over; the global utility sector has substantial optionality to any increase in power prices due to
natural gas and coal prices, which will be heavily influenced by trends in the US.
• On the supply side, US spot gas at $3.42/mmbtu is below the breakeven full‐cycle
natural gas production cost of $3.50‐4.00/mmbtu. We believe this provides downside
protection to the current gas price despite the proliferation of shale gas.
• Potential additional demand for natural gas is enormous:
� In the US power sector (37% of demand), EPA mandates will force coal plant
closures (e.g. potentially adding 10% to natural gas demand) and increase the
marginal switching cost for the most efficient plants to $4/mmbtu, providing a
runway for structurally higher gas demand/prices.
� Other large potential structural sources of demand arise from LNG exports
(also 10% of US demand), a gas‐intensive industrial renaissance (also 10%), and
substitution of LNG/CNG for oil‐based vehicle fuels.

• Leverage to higher power prices can be substantial. For example, in the US every
$1/mmbtu improvement in natural gas prices increases Exelon’s long‐term earnings by
more than 20%, whereas for pure generators such as NRG the leverage exceeds 30%.
• In Europe, where power is generated at close to cash production cost in many markets,
even a modest (e.g. 10%) combination of changes in coal, carbon and Euro prices can
have a 25‐50% earnings impact on several European utilities.
Global utility capex (ex‐US) is rebounding after a recession‐driven slowdown:
• System‐enhancing transmission capex is accelerating in Europe and Asia and is firm in
the US.
• US, European and Asian utilities are building much of the infrastructure needed to
capitalize on the global shale gas boom underway.
• In emerging markets, infrastructure spending is occurring across the entire value chain.
� Substantial alpha opportunities follow periods of underperformance (Section 5).
o Current MSCI World Utility Index underperformance against the MSCI World Index is the deepest
(‐67%) and longest (4 years) of the modern utility era, caused by a perfect storm of factors (see
page 15).
o Despite the strong rally in equity markets since the depths of the financial crisis, the global utility
sector is still down ‐11% in absolute terms and has underperformed the second‐worst sector
(telecom) over the same period by ‐23%. Previous periods of underperformance have set the
stage for substantial alpha opportunities driven by fundamental investors re‐entering the sector.
o The global utility sector does not need to outperform for Electron to generate solid performance;
80% of our 7‐year return (10.3% per annum) is from alpha (Jensen’s alpha calculation).
� Investing in the global utility sector does not mean taking undue interest rate risk (Section 6).
o The interest rate sensitivity of the sector has declined steadily since the modern utility era began
in the early 1990s. US utilities remain the most interest rate‐sensitive companies regionally.
o We track interest rate risk for all positions in our risk model, and the portfolio’s net interest rate
risk is kept within acceptable limits as we select stocks. In addition, Electron’s return correlation
to interest rates historically is slightly lower than the HFRI Equity Hedge Index’s return
correlation to interest rates.
o This process has worked well for us as Electron has posted strong returns and alpha generation in
both increasing and declining interest rate environments.
�
Investors should always have an allocation to the global utility sector.
o This is a large‐cap, dividend‐generating sector that is vitally important to national economies, and
which is subject to undercurrents of deregulation and competition. This has produced ample
long/short opportunities in the past and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.
o Moreover, an allocation to global utilities provides a diversification benefit to investor
portfolios. The risks affecting a global utility sector fund are very different from those affecting
other long/short funds and diversification enables higher returns per unit of risk. Electron’s 7‐
year track record correlation to the S&P 500 and HFRI Equity Hedge indices is .41 and .68,
respectively (.18 and .55, respectively, in down markets).

2. Structural Change – Advantageous Time for Global Utility Sector Long/Short Investing
The high level of structural change occurring around the globe makes this a particularly advantageous time
to be long/short investing in the global utility sector. The various examples for each region, the importance
of structural change to each region and the opportunities are listed in Section 3.
�
Structural Change in Electron’s Research Process
Since the original Electron was formed in 2004, Electron’s research process has focused on structural
change to determine its impact on the underlying future earnings potential of our companies (see
Appendix 1, page 22). Whenever there is structural change, distortions and inefficiencies arise. These
invariably result in both winners and losers among utility stocks, in large part because of the heavy
influence of public policy on the sector (e.g. governments and regulators). Policymakers will never want to
knowingly provide windfall profits to utilities; if a structural change is producing a winner, we look for the
loser. If a loser cannot be found, we keep looking: the loser will eventually surface.
�
Structural Change Cycle
As cycles are an important feature of life, so are cycles of structural change important in the global
industry. During the recession following the financial crisis, the activity level of structural change did
slow down around the globe. This is not surprising as governments, regulators and other stakeholders
slowed the pace of structural change (i.e. a hunkering down mentality took hold among utility
stakeholders) and companies slowed their rate of capital spending (because of uncertain economic
growth prospects). As time has passed, the outlook for global growth has stabilized, tail risks have been
managed and confidence has returned, and companies have begun spending previously‐delayed capex
needed to ensure system reliability. This collectively has prompted utility stakeholders to pick up the
pace of structural change. Given that we track structural change globally, we estimate that this inflection
point of increased structural change occurred approximately 12‐18 months ago.
�
Investors Not Positioned for Structural Change Pickup
That we are at an inflection point for a pickup in structural change is underappreciated by the market.
Moreover, it is occurring at a time when there are fewer eyes focused on global utilities. The
underappreciated pickup in structural change activity levels combined with low investor involvement
spells opportunity for the Electron Global Fund as it plays to the Electron team’s competitive advantage.
This driver was critical to the investment professionals’ decision to re‐launch the independent Electron.
o
Long‐Only Investors Substantially Underweight but Hedge Funds Turning
The global utility sector is the world’s most‐underweight sector by a large margin. Moreover, the
underweighting has dipped to a comparably extreme level only 4 times (including now) over the last
10 years. Each time this extreme has been crossed, over the next 24 months global utilities rose by
38% on an absolute basis and outperformed the global broad market by 20%, on average.

The sector has been not only a substantial long‐only underweight, but also a wholesale short for
many macro/generalist hedge funds. However, it is very interesting to note that an inflection point
appears to have occurred in the middle of 2012, with hedge funds increasing their net exposure to
the global utility sector after a long period of reducing net. The long/short ratio of utility stocks held
by hedge funds fell from 3.0x in Jan 08 to about 1.7x in Jan 12 (4 years), but has since risen by 60% to
2.7x, which is more than twice the increase for hedge funds’ overall net exposure during the same
period (source: Goldman Sachs).
Based on discussions with the Street, it appears that this short exposure has been expressed via ETFs,
regional utility indices or large bellwether index utility proxies. Individual name crowdedness has
continued to remain at a low level (e.g., utilities rarely show up Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund VIP list –
ticker GSTHHVIP). Today, utilities account for the lowest in gross assets held of the 10 global
sectors. (Source: Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund Trend Monitor analysis of 700 hedge funds with $1.3
trillion in gross assets.)
In addition, global QE programs have boosted demand for higher‐beta stocks, which has contributed
to the recent relative underperformance of and lack of interest in utilities. However (see below), the
underperformance of US utilities has diminished with each successive QE round (QE1

underperformance ‐39%, QE2 ‐12%, QE3 ‐5%), which signals exhaustion of selling pressure as the
relative value of the S&P versus utilities has stretched further. Given widespread use of QE, a similar
effect can be found in other regions.

3. Regional Structural Changes Driving Alpha Opportunity
Structural changes are occurring in all regions. Those in which Electron is currently investing or tracking closely
are as follows:
�
US Utilities
Of the global utility markets, we expect the US utilities market to face the strongest headwinds and be
the least‐attractive market for alpha generation over the next 2 years. Since the financial crisis, the US
has been the best‐performing region for utilities of all the developed markets, outperforming European
utilities by 40% over the last 4 years, and it is the region which is only slightly underweight by investors.
The US is the most defensive of all regions because of the large weighting of regulated names. Since 2008,
US utility earnings have been flat (versus a ‐45% decline in Europe), as consistent regulated earnings
growth of 3‐5% offset unregulated utility earnings declines resulting from lower power prices driven by
falling natural gas prices. Notwithstanding flat earnings growth, investors have re‐rated the US utility
sector’s PE multiple relative to the S&P as they sought more yield in a low‐yielding QE environment.
Today, US utilities are close to the sector’s pre‐crisis record valuation peak (trading at a 7% PE premium to
the S&P 500) when investors were discounting higher earnings growth from tightening power markets
(see below).

While we will continue to see solid growth from the regulated names, and a total return argument can
still be made that justifies the current premium valuation of US utilities, we do see capex growth starting
to level off. This is the opposite of what will happen in Europe and Asia, where we expect regulatory capex
to increase. Moreover, we believe US utility regulators will continue to pressure returns on equity
(ROEs) as interest rates remain low. We believe there is greater opportunity among companies with nonregulated
power generation assets, as we expect firm natural gas and thus power prices to flow through
to earnings. Note, for example, that every $1/mmbtu improvement in natural gas prices would increase
Exelon’s long‐term earnings by more than 20%, whereas for pure generators such as NRG the leverage
exceeds 30%.

European Utilities
We believe European utilities have the potential not only for the strongest outperformance but also for
the greatest alpha generation. Since the financial crisis, European utility earnings have declined
approximately ‐45% which is slightly less than European broader market earnings declines of ‐51% (Stoxx
600 or SXXP) and ‐58% (Stoxx 50 or SX5E). Prior to the crisis, European utilities used to trade at a 20%
premium to the broader market. During the recovery, European utilities suffered a ‐43% derating and
now trade at a 31% PE discount to the broader market. Most of this derating is explained by the
European utilities’ lack of participation in the European broad market PE multiple re‐rating (SX5E +115%,
SXXP +76%) since the recovery beginning in 2009. Moreover, approximately 40% of the sector is now
trading below book value.
Clearly, investors appear to believe that earnings have troughed for European companies broadly, but not
for European utilities. Concerns about political intervention along with low power and carbon prices have
prevented a re‐rating of the sector. However, we are comfortable that we are close to a bottom, and that
optionality is asymmetrically skewed to the upside for the European utilities, as many generation assets
are producing power at close to cash cost.
Relative to US utilities, European utilities have underperformed by ‐40% and the relative PE has de‐rated
by ‐11% since the crisis. The average European utility’s relative dividend yield is now 95% higher than that
of US peers before the crisis. Although some would argue that dividend cuts are coming (we agree
broadly, and see several interesting short opportunities), we do not see the entire sector’s dividends
being cut by 50%, as stock prices imply. As such, the sector today has dividend support even though some
dividend cuts will undoubtedly happen.
In addition to dividends, potentially higher power prices from both higher European coal and carbon
prices could also provide support. At present, the carbon market (EU ETS) in Europe is dysfunctional, with
carbon trading at €5/tonne, well below the cost required to spur investment in low‐carbon generating
capacity. We expect the carbon market to be restructured (already being discussed), thus raising the
price of carbon and increasing power prices. Moreover, with China’s GDP growth reaccelerating and 70%
of the resulting rise in electricity production generated from coal, we would anticipate a modest growth in
coal consumption in the Asian seaborne market, thereby supporting South African and European coal
prices. Given our view of rising US natural gas prices, we expect coal exports from the US to Europe to
fall. These are all factors that should support European coal prices even before accounting for greater
demand for coal that might come from Europe should growth return. Notwithstanding, short
opportunities will remain in several European markets due to the influence of renewables.
Moreover, if the European Central Bank were to lower its Main Refinancing Operations rate, currently 75
bps, and provide other monetary policy support, we would expect not only increased demand for
electricity (which would increase coal consumption) but also a weaker Euro would increase the Euro price
of coal (in Europe) and thus power prices. There are a number of factors at work here, and it is difficult to
predict levels with any degree of accuracy, but even small changes would have a significant impact on
the sector. For example, a combination of a +10% increase in coal prices, ‐10% decrease in the Euro/$
exchange rate, and a rise in the carbon credit price from €5 to €10/tonne would produce 25‐50% earnings
upside in many continental European utilities.

Asian Utilities
The Asian utility sector is a tale of two worlds. One enjoys a stable regulatory environment and solid
power purchase agreements, as in Hong Kong and Thailand; the other is a victim of government
intervention, as in Korea and China. The two worlds can coexist in the same country, for example in
Malaysia where independent power producers enjoy solid power purchase agreements while utility
Tenaga, which is a large employer and which faces the consumer directly, suffers from political meddling.
Capex cycles and potential regulatory changes, respectively, tend to dominate performance of the two
sides. For example, Korea Electric Power has outperformed sharply at times in the past on even small
steps toward fuel cost passthrough implementation. In India’s chaotic power markets, outperformance
could arise from even small steps toward implementation of urgently‐needed reform, e.g. any movement
to improve access to fuel supply (notably coal) for independent power producers. The dichotomy
between the two “worlds” of the Asian utility sector provides ample opportunities to generate alpha.
The vast population and developing nature of the region, and consequent issues of energy security and
environmental sustainability, create additional forces for structural change. For example, as China
increasingly promotes natural gas usage, we will see gradual pricing reform, more natural gas imports,
greater natural gas vehicle adoption and accelerating shale gas development.

Japanese Utilities
The impact of the Fukushima incident on Japanese utilities will last for years. Nuclear policy will continue
to be reviewed – notably the decision whether to restart nuclear power plants – which will affect the
utilities’ long‐term fuel mix and therefore cost base.
For example, Kansai Electric Power, which has the largest exposure to nuclear generation after Tokyo
Electric, stopped paying dividends after the nuclear shutdown. Every 1% change in its nuclear fleet
utilization rate will affect earning by almost 10% over a normalized level; nuclear policy decisions can thus
create outcomes for share prices of +/‐ 50%.
The ripples from changing nuclear policy will have a long‐lasting impact, both negative and positive, on
companies involved in the nuclear value chain (e.g., reactor manufacturers such as Mitsubishi Heavy) and
other power‐related sectors such as gas and renewable energy. Relative to other regions, Japanese
utilities will be the most affected by macro factors (e.g. the Yen, interest rates, fossil fuel prices, etc.).

In addition to region‐specific structural changes, there are structural changes that have a global impact on the
utility sector.
�
Power Prices are Skewed to the Upside
The cost of natural gas and coal sets the marginal power price in many power markets around the globe.
The rapid rise in US shale production that began in 2007 caused domestic gas prices to decline much more
rapidly than other fuels and put downward pressure on power prices both in the US and globally. For US
gas‐fired generator Calpine, lower fuel costs offset lower power prices and the company emerged a
relative winner. Virtually all other US generators employ a mix of assets fired by costlier fuels and suffered
a tremendous margin squeeze, with – in the most extreme example – coal‐fired generator Dynegy
declaring bankruptcy in 2012. We believe the downward trend in US natural gas prices has flattened for
reasons noted below, and upward optionality remains, which will affect power prices not only in the US
but also Europe and Asia given cross‐border commodity linkages.
In Europe, in an example of the regional, non‐correlated character of the global utility sector, a quite
different dynamic has taken shape, with coal‐generated power margins remaining attractive relative to
natural gas‐fired generation margins. Coal prices in Europe have declined as a result of cheaper US and
Colombian coal imports (because of US shale gas) and the knock‐on effect of softening Asian coal prices.
Carbon costs (i.e. EU ETS) embedded in power prices also have declined, from €16/tonne 2 years ago to
€5/tonne today, largely as a result of the European recession. With European natural gas prices at 3x US
prices (unlike in the US, natural gas prices in Europe are linked by convention to oil), European utilities
have been minimizing natural gas generation and maximizing coal generation. So, unlike the situation in
the US, coal generators such as Drax in the UK have enjoyed better margins on higher power output (see
below) as gas plants sit underutilized.

We believe a floor price exists for natural gas despite shale production. We fully acknowledge that the
US has large reserves of shale gas awaiting development. However, the current spot price ($3.42/mmbtu)
sits below the breakeven full‐cycle cost of most US basins ($3.50‐$4.00/mmbtu), which has led producers
to focus on liquids‐rich plays and de‐emphasize dry‐gas production. Accordingly, the gas rig count is at a
decade low and the Energy Information Administration expects gas production to be flat through 2014.
With the wide spread between oil and U.S. natural gas prices likely to continue, we expect the growth in
liquids shale production to remain much higher than gas.
On the demand side, the power sector is the largest consumer (37%) of natural gas in the US. At prices
below $5/mmbtu, coal switching begins, and at prices below $3/mmbtu, gas‐fired power generating units
become competitive against even the most efficient coal units. Importantly, the breakeven point for coalto‐gas
switching will rise materially due to EPA mandates. By 2015, these standards move the breakeven
point for the most efficient coal units from $3/mmbtu to approximately $4/mmbtu, close to where
current forward prices sit.
Large potential structural changes in demand create upside optionality. There has been much media
focus on the growth of shale gas production, so much so that we believe potential demand drivers are
underappreciated. For example, currently‐planned US coal plant retirements, if repowered with gas,
would support an additional 6 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) of gas demand, adding nearly 10% to total
US demand. In addition, we see the potential for LNG exports to exceed another 6 bcf/d (27 bcf/d of
project capacity awaits US Department of Energy approval). Cheap gas is also spurring an industrial
resurgence, with new petrochemical plants being proposed in the Gulf and traditional coal users such as
steel mills contemplating refiring their facilities with gas instead of metallurgical coal. Longer term, LNG
as a vehicle fuel substitute for long haul trucks and CNG for lighter vehicles could also add materially to
gas demand. Given the number of possible structural demand changes and the enormous potential from
each, we believe the optionality for natural gas prices is clearly to the upside.
We believe the recent trend of softer US natural gas prices leading to a deflationary impact on global
utility sector earnings is, then, largely played out. Longer‐term, we see many positive demand

fundamentals that are supportive of higher natural gas prices; while we don’t expect a return to the
commodity boom times of 2003‐2007, a turn in trend will be very supportive of higher share prices.
�
Capex (ex‐US) is Rebounding Post‐Recession
Capital spending precedes earnings, and utility capex (ex‐US) is rebounding after a recession‐driven
slowdown. In particular, transmission spending is accelerating in Europe (Germany, Spain, France) and
Asia while remaining firm in the US. Transmission capex not only enhances system reliability but also
system efficiency, by enabling the delivery of the most efficient generation to meet demand. Many
transmission grids face bottlenecks because of the inclusion of intermittent renewable generation in areas
with ample wind and solar resources but located far from customers. Companies such as Northeast
Utilities (US), National Grid (UK) and Elia (Belgium/Germany) are prime beneficiaries of this transmission
capital spending, along with equipment providers such as ABB (Switzerland).
In addition, many global utilities will be viewed as back‐door beneficiaries of the shale gas boom
globally given the substantial amount of capex required to build new or upgrade existing infra‐structure.
US utilities are building much of the infrastructure to export gas out of the shale basins (Dominion,
NiSource) and are building LNG liquefaction facilities (Dominion, Sempra) that are at the front of the
queue for US Department of Energy approval. Several European utilities, such as GDF Suez
(Belgium/France) and Gas Natural (Spain), and Asian utilities such as Kunlun Energy and ENN Energy
(China; note that China has 2x the shale gas reserves of the US) are exposed to LNG infrastructure
spending.
Finally, because of emerging markets’ growth rates and a higher intensity of energy use, emerging market
utilities will benefit from infrastructure spending across the entire utility value chain.
5. Substantial Alpha Opportunities Follow Periods of Underperformance
The global utility sector has experienced record underperformance and often this precedes substantial
alpha opportunities.
�
Record Duration and Depth of Underperformance
We have analyzed the price performance of the global utility sector since 1995, when MSCI introduced its
Global Sectors. Although the period includes only 18 years of data, this is the relevant time frame as it
effectively covers the entire period of industry deregulation (see Appendix 2, page 25).
As can be seen below, the current period of global utility underperformance is the deepest (‐67%) and
longest (4 years) of the modern utility era. Even with the strong rally in equity markets since the financial
crisis, the global utility sector is still down ‐11% on an absolute basis. It has not only been the worstperforming
MSCI global sector but has also underperformed the second‐worst global sector by ‐23%.

�
Reasons for Underperformance
Much of this recent underperformance can be explained by investors’ textbook preference, coming out of
recession, to add high‐beta stocks and shed low‐growth utilities. This was exacerbated by:
o soft power demand growth (particularly in Europe);
o generation overcapacity;
o delays in capital spending;
o lower commodity prices (particularly as a result of US shale gas production);
o central banks’ quantitative easing;
o political interference (notably in Europe);
o high debt loads;
o the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan; and
o concerns about interest rate rises from today’s very low levels.
It is hard to imagine a more perfect storm for the global utility sector than that which has played out
over the past 4 years.
�
Potential Exists for Sharp Outperformance
Globally or regionally, it is not unusual to find long and/or sharp periods of utility underperformance (as
with the current record period). During such periods, when combined with wholesale shorts and market
underweighting, the sector becomes poised for extended outperformance rallies. This results from
fundamental investors (both long/short and long‐only) rotating into the sector en masse, bidding up the
best value and growth utilities and underweighting or shorting utilities with poor business

models/prospects. This can be triggered by improving sector fundamentals, better data points, or
conversely by events that instead lower investors’ perception of economic growth prospects (e.g., policy
errors, rising European sovereign yields, higher commodity prices, etc.).
As noted above (page 5), each time the sector’s underweighting reaches 1 standard deviation below the
mean, over the next 24 months global utilities rise by 38% on an absolute basis and outperform the global
broad market by 20%, on average (see graph below).

outperformance

When these outperformance rallies occur, the potential massive alpha opportunity can be substantially
greater than the return from a fund’s net position.
As examples, we highlight the lessons from the dotcom period (second only to today’s record
underperformance) and lessons from Japan (given the deleveraging environment of today).
o
Post‐Dotcom Rallies
The last time we saw underperformance anywhere close to today’s magnitude was during the 3‐
year run‐up to the dotcom bust (see graph below) as investors grabbed for growth in the “new
economy”. During the run‐up (Jan 97‐Jan 00), tech and telecom were the best‐performing sectors,
+322% and +162%, respectively. The global utilities sector was the second‐worst‐performing global
sector, +12% and in line with the +9% worst‐performing materials sector.

Of course, not all investors sold utilities – some were astute buyers. Warren Buffett (at the time,
thought to be a bit out of touch with the new economy) acquired $12 billion worth of utility assets
between 1999 and 2002, namely MidAmerican ($9 billion), Kern River Gas Transmission ($960 million)
and Northern Natural Gas ($1.9 billion).
Following the dotcom bust (Mar 00‐Sep 01), global utilities staged a sharp catch‐up rally over a 1.5‐
year period, generating +33% outperformance (‐5% absolute). During this period, US utilities (which
previously were the worst‐performing region for utilities during the run‐up) outperformed +68%
(+37% absolute). But the averages conceal some outsized moves in utility stocks as investors
returned to the sector en masse. Early investors realized enormous absolute returns on low‐beta US
utility stocks (e.g. SO +114%, ETR +114%, FE +99%, AEP +91%, PEG +78%) while the S&P sank ‐31%.
Still, investors were discriminating as several stocks (e.g., CVA ‐45%, AES ‐34%, EIX ‐19%, PCG ‐16%,
NU ‐3%) suffered absolute declines.
In Europe, the UK water utility stocks (among the lowest‐beta/volatility stocks in the global sector)
were wholly ignored during the dotcom rally despite their improving fundamentals. Following the
dotcom bust (Mar 00‐Sep 01) they also staged a fierce outperformance rally, and early fundamental
investors realized very attractive absolute returns (e.g. Pennon +80%, Severn Trent +52% and United
Utilities +21%), and enormous outperformance of the broader market (FTSE 100 Index ‐33%). This is
all the more impressive when you consider that these water utility stocks have betas of
approximately .43, less than half that of the broad market.
Again, fundamental investors were discerning as several European utilities experienced absolute
declined during this same period (e.g., EDP ‐31%, Enel ‐30%, Endesa ‐20%, Centrica ‐19%).

Japan Rallies
Japan offers insights into potential utility outperformance during periods of private sector
deleveraging similar to what developed markets have experienced since the financial crisis.
Richard Koo, Chief Economist of the Nomura Research Institute, cites two major policy errors that
extended Japan’s long balance sheet recession: increased taxes in 1997 and expenditure cuts in 2001.
Both policy errors were preceded by a long or sharp period of utility underperformance relative to

the broader market. Following the policy errors, Japanese utilities staged exceptionally strong
outperformance rallies lasting over 1.5 years, on average, and outperforming the Topix by 30‐40%
(graph below).
Source: Nomura Research Institute, Bloomberg
During the Jan 97–Nov 98 policy error period, fundamental investors bid up the better prospects
(Tokyo Electric Power and Osaka Gas each rose 34%) while the Topix declined by ‐19. During this
same period, some Japanese utilities also posted sharp absolute declines, such as Hokkaido Gas ‐49%,
Saibu Gas ‐30% and Okinawa Electric ‐27%. During the May 01‐May 03 policy error period, Okinawa
Electric and Hokkaido Gas rallied +40% and +23%, respectively, while the Topix declined ‐44% and
Tokyo Electric Power and Osaka Gas declined ‐13% and ‐7%, respectively.
The Japanese utility experience is very interesting as several economists question whether the US is
currently committing similar policy errors while deleveraging is still occurring in the private sector
(e.g. the US just increased income and payroll taxes and is implementing austerity measures). The
Japanese experience demonstrates the potential for strong outperformance rallies during periods of
deleveraging, demonstrating the alpha opportunity arising from an influx of fundamental investors
into the sector after periods of limited interest.
o
Potential for Yield Catch‐up
Unlike other income‐oriented investments such as Treasuries, German bunds, UK gilts, investmentgrade
bonds, high‐yield bonds, emerging market bonds and MLPs, all of which have rallied strongly –
some believe as the result of a yield bubble – the global utility sector has been left behind; yet
certain parts offer a compelling investment yield opportunity today. If some fixed income cross‐over
investors become more concerned about inflation (because of economic growth), yet continue to be
squeezed by the QE programs of the Fed, BOE, BOJ, etc., then they could begin shifting into global
utilities. This seems logical, as such investors would look for the closest bond proxies in the equity
market, the utility sector, rather than bypass utilities for high‐beta broad market stocks. Given the
enormous amounts of capital controlled by fixed income cross‐over investors, even a small
reweighting could have a significant effect in bidding utility stock prices up and yields down.

6. Interest Rate Risk – A Common Misperception
We find a common misperception among investors to be the degree of interest rate risk in the global utility
sector, as interest rate sensitivity has declined steadily since the modern utility industry came into being in
the early 1990s.
There is a relatively higher degree of interest rate risk in the defensive, fully‐regulated utilities given their
bond‐like returns and the capital‐intensive nature of the industry, which demands heavy use of debt financing.
Such defensive fully‐regulated utilities can be found in all regions, however the highest concentration is found
in the US. European, Asian and Latam utilities are more levered to economic growth and therefore tend to be
no more interest rate‐sensitive than broad market equities.
Even the performance of the more interest rate‐sensitive US utilities is not fully determined by interest rates.
For example, during the market rally from fall 2002 to summer 2007, the US utility sector generated a nonbeta‐adjusted
annualized total return 5.2% higher (2.8% from better price appreciation and 2.4% from
dividend reinvestment) than the S&P 500, while the 10‐year Treasury yield rose from 3.6% to 4.9% (+130 bps)
over this period. Valuation re‐rating and earnings growth from generators, as economic growth tightened
power markets and raised commodity prices, outweighed the negative impact of rising interest rates.
We would note furthermore that yield relationships have moved to unprecedented extremes such that, for
example, the dividend yield for US regulated utilities versus the 10‐year Treasury yield currently sits at 7
standard deviations above the mean from the historical pre‐2008 environment (see graph below). An even
more dramatic relationship exists for the European utilities. This suggests that policy rates are at such levels
that there is substantial cushion against rising rates.
Source: Bloomberg
Finally, we track interest rate risk in the Electron risk model for all positions. We are not looking to make
macro calls, and the portfolio’s net interest rate risk is kept within acceptable limits as we select stocks in the
global utility sector. This process has worked well for us as over 7 years we have posted strong returns and
alpha generation in both rising and falling interest rate environments. As a result, many investors are
pleasantly surprised to learn that despite perceptions of the global utility sector’s interest rate sensitivity,
Electron’s return correlation to interest rates is slightly lower than the HFRI Equity Hedge Index’s return
correlation to interest rates.

Appendix 1: The Team and Our Process
�
Electron Focus
Electron’s universe of utility and infrastructure stocks is deep, comprising 375 companies with a market
cap of $2.8 trillion. Stocks covered include the electric, gas, water and waste utilities in addition to
infrastructure companies (defined as those levered to utilities or utility‐like). Our approach is truly global
as 40‐60% of the portfolio’s historical gross has been allocated outside the US.
�
Electron Team
Electron’s cohesive, long‐standing team consists of 8 members, including 5 investment professionals who
have worked (with Jos Shaver as Portfolio Manager) at SAC Capital and the original Electron Capital for an
average of 6 years. In addition, 4 of the 5 investment professionals have lived outside the US, a distinct
competitive advantage given our global approach. Each investment professional brings his/her own
specific expertise and diligent research to our process, working collaboratively across regions to conduct
deep‐dive research on the most compelling opportunities in the global utility sector.
The other members of Electron complement the skills and experience of the investment team. Electron’s
experienced operations/investor relations professionals are former Intrepid Capital employees who
worked with the Electron team during the first iteration of Electron (2005–2008) when the firm had a
services agreement with Intrepid Capital.
Finally, a Senior Advisory Board consisting of former C‐level utility executives from around the globe has
been with the team since the launch of the original Electron Capital in 2005, and all have rejoined for
Electron’s re‐launch.
As Portfolio Manager, Jos Shaver has covered the global utility and infrastructure sectors for the past 21
years, and his sector perspective benefits from his having lived 10 years abroad (5 years in Asia covering
the Asian utilities and 5 years in Europe covering European utilities) and 11 years in the US. In addition, as
Managing Partner, Jos controls all major decisions at Electron.
�
Track Record (7 years)
Electron’s 7‐year track record (3 years audited from the original Electron and 4 years from SAC Capital)
has annualized 10.3% since inception and has been characterized by strong alpha generation on both the
long and short side (80% of returns, based on Jensen’s alpha calculation). Electron generated this 7‐year
track record during an exceptionally challenging period for global utilities – the MSCI World Utility Index
has been the worst‐performing MSCI Global Sector ex‐financials over the track record period, down ‐0.2%.
Notwithstanding, Electron’s track record has bested the MSCI World Utility, S&P 500 and HFRI indices by
91%, 67% and 61%, respectively.
�
Process
First, given Electron’s global approach to utility research, we tend to have a clear competitive advantage
with respect to early recognition of cross‐border structural change (e.g., how a change in Asian seaborne
coal market might affect off‐peak power prices and thus earnings for a Midwest US utility). Moreover,
our global research approach allows us to gain perspective on structural change outcomes given our
knowledge of global precedents and the likely reaction from various interested parties (e.g., governments,
regulators, managements, customers, consumer groups, rating agencies, shareholders, debt holders, et
al.) We analyze other global precedents, develop a thesis and then conduct deep‐dive research to gain
conviction. Once we have developed a structural change thesis, we proceed to a full bottoms‐up analysis

of the earnings impact for the relevant companies, and assess what might be priced in by thoroughly
reviewing the Street’s numbers and commentary. It should also be noted that the same structural event
often affects not one but several companies, and the implementation of these structural changes are
typically not one‐day events. As such, depending on the situation, we may have the opportunity to
capitalize on the same structural change event several times as it develops.
Our research process is our primary idea generator. We travel extensively and, collectively, the 5
investment professionals will have between 600 and close to 1,000 meetings a year as we speak with
companies, regulators, consultants, sell‐side analysts and governments.
o
Why We Take a Global Approach ‐ The “Greatest Gift”
Electron takes a global approach (historically, 40‐60% of gross allocated outside the US) to the
utility sector: i) to spot structural change and resultant inefficiencies early, ii) to provide a wider
canvas to allocate capital around the globe to the most attractive (from a risk/reward point of view)
alpha opportunities and, most importantly, iii) to enable the Electron Global Funds to take advantage
of the global sector’s very low inter‐regional correlation (i.e., correlation of regions within the global
sector; lowest of all MSCI global sectors – see below).
One of the least
correlated sectors
Source: MSCI, 7 years’ weekly trailing correlation
We call this very low regional correlation the global utility sector’s greatest gift to long/short
investors as it provides a greater return per unit of risk if one has the ability to dynamically allocate
capital to and generate alpha in all regions. There are few long/short global utility funds today given
the global utility experience required to capture the greatest gift, as different countries have different
utility market designs and structures.
The Electron process starts with a focus on structural change and we embrace the myriad of utility
markets’ differences around the globe because this approach leads to the most attractive alpha
opportunities and the benefits of the “greatest gift”. We allocate capital dynamically to the most
attractive alpha opportunities in the global utility industry. As a result, the Electron Global Funds is
only one fund, yet the “greatest gift” provides the diversification benefit of 4 relatively uncorrelated
regions and concentration in the globe’s most attractive alpha opportunities.

o
Capitalizing on Structural Change Timing
Although some of the structural changes discussed earlier happen in days or weeks, e.g. fuel cost
passthrough adjustments, others will take years to implement, for example, new capacity payment
structures. Because of the sector’s high earnings visibility, however, we do not have to wait until a
particular structural change occurs for a thesis to play out. Utilities often have earnings visibility 2‐3
years out (including Street estimates) which is in contrast to other sectors (e.g. tech) which often
times do not have 2‐3 quarters of visibility. As such, utility stock prices (and the Street’s estimates)
will begin to discount even some of the longer dated structural changes as clarity surfaces in the early
stages. Therefore, there is a distinct competitive advantage for those who have an early
understanding of such structural changes and the resulting earnings impact on affected utilities. We
therefore focus our efforts on discerning the structural change opportunity early in an effort to come
up with a view before it becomes obvious to the broader market.
Moreover, there are often several opportunities over an extended time period to trade the same
structural change as numerous stakeholders (e.g. government, regulator, company, customers, et al.)
involved in the process distort market perceptions of the final outcome.
Although structural changes are the “home run” opportunities, Electron returns are not limited to
such changes, as we also consistently play for “singles and doubles” in the global utility sector with
earning releases, regulatory reviews, dividend increases and decreases, relative value, regulatory
arbitrage, etc.
As evidence of Electron’s ability to successfully trade both shorter‐ and longer‐term structural
changes, please note our sweet spot for generating returns over the 7‐year track record has tended
to be 45‐90 days.
�
Portfolio Construction
Typically, the portfolio has 70‐100 positions, but concentration is very important to generating returns.
Historically, the top 10 longs represent 40‐50% of the Fund’s value, and top 10 shorts represent 30‐40% of
the fund’s value. Typically we will have a 10% position in the portfolio; this is invariably a liquid, big‐cap
utility name with limited downside and a good degree of upside which is expected to be favorably
affected by a key, underappreciated structural change.
The stronger the conviction (from a risk/reward point of view) in the alpha opportunity, the higher the
gross we run. This flexibility in portfolio construction (which we successfully proved over 3 years during
the first iteration of Electron) provides a distinct advantage given the utility sector’s many low‐beta, lowvolatility
stocks. During the original Electron Capital period, gross ranged from 150% to 215% and a
median of 185% over the period. We see maintaining a similar operating range for gross for the re‐launch
for Electron.
Regarding nets, we will always have a properly hedged product as there are always opportunities on the
short side to generate alpha. Over our 7‐year track record period, the net averaged 22% net long. During
the first 3 years of Electron, our net averaged 30% long. Given our bearish view on utilities over the last 4
years, the net averaged 17% net long.
�
Risk Model and Risk Management
We view utilities as distinct bundles of risk. Just as we are staunch supporters of sum‐of‐the‐parts (SOTP)
valuation, we are also believers in SOTP risk monitoring. As such, our risk model developed over the last
For exclusive of Jeffrey Epstein
22
Electron Capital Partners, LLC

8 years tracks approximately 60 industry, commodity, and financial risk metrics and is a focus for the
Electron team. For example, consider oil price risk; although there may be no direct oil exposure in the
portfolio, there is indirect oil exposure if we were to be short Drax, a coal‐fired generator that sells power
into the UK power market. In the UK, natural gas sets the marginal price of power, and in Europe, by
convention, natural gas is linked to the oil price; as such, a short position in Drax represents an effective
short position in oil. We track this risk along with numerous other factors that affect utilities, with the
purpose of minimizing risks for which we have no competitive advantage that would justify taking on the
exposure. We describe the risk model in more detail in the marketing book. In addition, we make the
Electron risk model available for all prospective investors’ due diligence.
Each position in the risk model contains a thesis write‐up (to avoid thesis creep); upside, downside and
relative targets (for valuation discipline); and a time frame (to avoid collecting stocks). In addition to
tracking numerous industry, financial and macro risks, we also track alpha generation for all of our
regions, sectors, subsectors and sub‐subsectors, which provides the added benefit of a granular window
on market flows. Finally, we incorporate an exponential function into the risk model that provides an
early alert and focuses our attention when something is not working. For example, we might be short
XYZ utility with 30% downside potential over 3 months, and put in a 15% loss limit. If in the first week XYZ
runs up 5%, it will trigger a “FAST” move alert in the risk model. If we cannot explain why the position is
moving against us, we will cover (i.e., when in doubt, get out). As mentioned, this is not a crowded space
(rarely do utility names appear on the Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund VIP list) and many names are low‐beta,
low‐volatility stocks. However, often when money is lost on the short side, it is the result of small daily
losses that would not be noticeable on any given day, but over even short periods of time can add up to
sizeable losses.
�
Shorting Global Utilities
o
Experience with Dividends and Investor Behavior
During the underperformance of the global utility industry over the last 4 years, Electron generated
very strong alpha on the short side. We spend almost twice as much time on the short side as we do
the long side; this is driven not only by the need for more short positions (given the asymmetry of
risk) but also because of the effect of utility dividends on investor behavior. For example, we might
be short a large cap utility with a 4% dividend yield that we believe to be a structural loser. The stock
might decline 25%, which would push the dividend yield up to 5.5%. Even though our valuation
models might tell us there is still another 10‐15% valuation downside, we will tend to cover (unless
we believe the dividend is materially at risk), as the dividend yield will begin to provide support for
the stock. The precise level of the dividend yield at which we would cover is as much an art as a
science, as it is based on our experience in a variety of situations and our views on investor behavior
(particularly income funds) gained over many years of covering the sector. As such, you will find us
trading around our short positions more frequently than our long positions.
o
Key to Electron’s Process to Identify Dividend Change Candidates
We also have developed a certain expertise in being early and correctly calling dividend changes – an
event that can have a dramatic impact on the performance of utilities given the make‐up of the
investor base. In our long experience, utility CEO/CFOs will strongly defend the company’s dividend
(often borrowing or selling assets to fund it). As such, when they do finally cut the dividend, or talk
about the possibility, they often surprise the market.
It pays to be diligent in assessing the potential for a dividend cut, and to be early, since once
CEO/CFOs accept that their business model is deteriorating, they will quickly take action, especially if
their companies have less flexibility (particularly with respect to cutting capex and opex). Large‐cap
utility managements desire strong credit ratings and are reluctant to risk an investment grade rating.

They are in a capital‐intensive business and need to preserve deep, low‐cost access to both the equity
and debt capital markets. Moreover, collateral requirements for forward power price hedging
typically will spike if a utility loses its investment grade rating, which can spur concern about liquidity.
Building conviction around a dividend cut thesis requires more than screening. Our process focuses
on researching capex flexibility, cost‐cutting potential and asset divestiture potential to determine
the flexibility a company has under various scenarios. Our research process breaks capex into 3
buckets: i) committed capex (e.g. required by the regulator), ii) nondiscretionary capex (e.g. major
plant overhauls – CEOs tend to avoid delays so as not to jeopardize billion dollar‐plus assets), and iii)
discretionary capex (CEOs can delay but may jeopardize future growth).
Regarding opex, we look for cost‐cutting capability, which we estimate by breaking apart the opex
line or by global benchmarking. Finally, we estimate the potential impact from possible asset
divestitures and the resulting impact on earnings and leverage. Once we have completed the
research work on capex, opex and potential divestitures, we model various sensitivities from
structural changes or other key drivers that might cause a deterioration or improvement in a utility
company’s business model against forward‐looking credit rating agency (S&P, Moody’s, etc.) ratios.

Appendix 2: Global Utility Sector Background
�
History
To gain a deeper appreciation of why the global utility sector is attractive for long/short investing, it is
helpful to briefly survey the history of the sector and describe the utility value chain’s components.
The utility industry as we know it began in 1882 when Thomas Edison built the world’s first generating
station on Pearl Street in downtown Manhattan. In the early decades the industry evolved along multiple
lines but eventually settled into an integrated, fully‐regulated model, deemed appropriate as utilities
were considered to have monopoly power. During the era of full regulation, utility stocks were often
characterized as low‐risk “widow and orphan” stocks in the US, and large parts of the global utility
industry remained government‐owned. During these early days, long/short investing could not have
existed at scale, as the ability to find and generate short alpha would have been difficult given the sector’s
government ownership and bond‐like nature of returns.
In the 1980s, Lord David Howell (formerly UK Secretary of State for Energy in the Thatcher government)
advocated having then‐fully regulated power plants compete to sell their production into a competitive
power market (a “power pool”) where the price of electricity would be set at the intersection of supply
(power plants) and demand (industrial users and electricity supply companies selling to households). This
led to the world’s first competitive power pools being rolled out in the UK in the early 1990s. While
based in Asia, Jos Shaver led UBS’ Asian utility industry group and had the privilege of working with Lord
Howell when UBS acted as advisor to the State Power Corporation of China on the restructuring of that
country’s national power industry.
Competitive power pools have since sprung up all over the world, and regulators have pulled apart
previously fully‐integrated utilities in the name of efficiency and maximizing competition. In addition,
governments around the world have begun to privatize their state utility industries and organize bespoke
competitive market structures that best meet their needs. These changes have resulted in a hybrid
modern industry which continues to evolve.
The deregulatory impulse has brought tremendous benefits to national economies, driving down costs
and improving efficiency and system reliability, but has also produced unintended consequences, e.g., the
high‐profile bankruptcies of Enron, British Energy, Dynegy, NRG, PG&E and others. As such, although one
can still find low‐beta, low‐volatility defensive stocks, the global utility sector has not been for “widow
and orphan” investors for quite some time due to structural changes in an evolving industry that
continue to alter the investment landscape.
It is important to note that the modern utility industry is still in its infancy, having begun in the early
1990s, and its continued evolution – structural change – will provide ample long/short opportunities for
the foreseeable future. Structural change catalysts are driven by: i) a utility’s various stakeholders,
including governments, managements, consumers, et al. which seek to mold the utility to their needs and
objectives, or ii) variables outside of stakeholder control such as commodity prices and new technologies.
A specialist approach to the global utility sector is essential as each country’s market structure (and often
that of regions within countries) can be very different as a result of the varying levels of competition,
market concentration, geographic constraints, infrastructure bottlenecks, regulatory constructs, fuel
supply availability and so on.

Utility Value Chain
The electricity value chain for a modern day fully integrated utility consists of Generation + Transmission
+ Distribution + Customers (see diagram below). Each segment of the value chain is a different business,
with distinct risks and economic drivers. Competition has surfaced in each part of the value chain other
than transmission and distribution (which are fully‐regulated assets as they are deemed to be natural
monopolies). Still, regulators have learned to bring indirect competition even to monopoly‐regulated
businesses by encouraging returns based on efficiency improvements or benchmarking to comparable
companies.

start by collection of data. I recall watching your criticisms of
work that was just abstraction on abstraction, with no data at

if 1t is the prosecution who subpoenas confidential victim information. Due process is satisfied as long as the prosecution and
D257

the defense have reciprocal rights and courts apply the Rules consistently.
The objectionable feature of the Advisory Committee proposal is that the subpoena could be issued without notice to a crime
victim. A narrower issue is whether certain pleadings could be filed on this question on an ex parte basis. Such ex parte filing
might be appropriate, in the sense that once the court gives notice that it is considering whether to issue a subpoena, then the
defendant, the government, or, indeed, the victim might wish to file parts of their pleadings under seal for good cause shown.
Requests for such sealing could be handled in the ordinary course of litigation - once the victim knew that such litigation was
occurring.

Even if there is some tangential defense interest in conceding strategy, the Advisory Committee proposal addresses it in the
most haphazard way. Consider the Elizabeth Smart example mentioned earlier, in which the defense sent ex parte subpoenas to
Elizabeth's school and hospital. Under the Advisory Committee's proposal, a court could still decide to approve those
subpoenas ex parte to prevent disclosure of some secret defense strategy. But once the school and the hospital received the
subpoenas, nothing would bar them from revealing the subpoenas’ existence to the victim - and, indeed, the world. Thus, the
interest the Advisory Committee purports to protect (concealing defense trial strategy) would actually be [*908] protected
only when the third party, for whatever reason, chose not reveal the subpoena. In the Smart case, for instance, the school did
not reveal the defense strategy ?°° because it simply handed the materials over to the defense - in possible contravention of
the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. 7°? But the hospital refused to hand over Elizabeth's records and contacted the
Smart family, which ultimately led to a public outcry over the subpoenas. There is no rhyme or reason to a procedure that is
supposed to protect defense strategy but that actually turns on the happenstance of whether third parties choose to notify crime
victims or the public about subpoenas they receive.

The haphazardness of the Advisory Committee's approach becomes even clearer when one realizes that defense strategy can
be protected only where the confidential information happens to rest in the hands of a third party rather than the victim herself.
Consider, for example, a rape victim who has talked to a rape crisis counselor, who takes notes of the meeting. A defendant
might attempt to subpoena those notes from the counselor. 7° But if the counselor had previously transferred the notes back to
the rape victim, then the subpoena would have to be directed to the victim herself - and the victim could then move to quash the
subpoena. This is not some academic hypothetical, as rape counselors in Pennsylvania in the 1980s used precisely this
procedure to protect their clients against abusive defense subpoenas. 7°! Moreover, rape counselors - and, indeed, most third
parties involved in maintaining the personal and confidential information of victims - will probably have very strong incentives

257 See Wardius v. Oregon, 412 U.S. 470, 475-76 (1973); United States v. Bahamonde, 445 F.3d 1225, 1229 (9th Cir. 2006); Newman v.
Hopkins, 192 F.3d 1132, 1135 (8th Cir. 1999), vacated 529 U.S. 1084 (2000); United States ex rel. Veal v. DeRobertis, 693 F.2d 642, 646-
47 (7th Cir. 1982). Indeed, such reciprocity may not even be required if significant governmental interests support its omission. See
Wardius, 412 U.S. at 476.

258 Such as it was - apparently the only reason for the subpoenas was to try and dig up some dirt on the young kidnapping victim. See
Stephen Hunt, Defense Blasted for Obtaining Smart's School Records, Salt Lake Trib., Jan. 14, 2005, at B2.

259 20 U.S.C. § 1232g(b) (2006).

260 As will be discussed shortly in the next Section of this Article, such a subpoena would likely be inappropriate for substantive reasons as
well. See supra Part IV, § 3.

261 The Pennsylvania Supreme Court initially found that records held by rape counseling centers were subject to only limited protection from
defense subpoenas. See Jn re Pittsburgh Action Against Rape, 428 A.2d 126, 132 (Pa. 1981). The results of that unfortunate decision were
swift. Rape victims requested the return of their records from the center and, in some cases, even requested termination of the counseling
relationship. Commonwealth v. Wilson, 602 A.2d 1290, 1294 n.6 (Pa. 1992); Tera Jckowski Peterson, Comment, Distrust and Discovery: The
Impending Debacle in Discovery of Rape Victims' Counseling Records in Utah, 2007 Utah L. Rev. 695; Beth Stouder, Note, Pennsylvania
Establishes New Privilege for Communications Made to a Rape Crisis Center Counselor - In re Pittsburgh Action Against Rape, 55 Temp.
L.Q. 1124, 1146 (1982). In light of this serious problem, the Pennsylvania legislature enacted a new, absolute privilege protecting
communications to rape crisis counselors from any disclosure without the consent of the victim. See 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5945.1(b) (2000)
(upheld against constitutional attack in Wilson, 602 A.2d at 1297).

U.S. and International
Cannabis Market Estimates

= Global Market Overview

Cannabis is the most widely cultivated, produced, trafficked and consumed drug worldwide, accord-
ing to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). In 2003, the UNODC estimated
that the global illegal cannabis market was $113 billion, with 160 million consumers. The UNODC
continues to estimate the number of cannabis users worldwide and recently estimated that 183 million
people globally between the ages of 15 and 64, or more than 4% of this age group, consumed cannabis
in 2015.

In 2010, the RAND Corporation (RAND) estimated that the U.S. illegal cannabis market was
$40 billion. Adjusting this estimate solely for inflation and population growth, the U.S. illegal market
would now be approximately $48 billion.

Both the UNODC and RAND acknowledge the challenges inherent in studying an illegal con-
sumer market, and both allow significant room for error in their estimates. However approximate,
their estimates make clear that there is significant global demand for cannabis. Less clear is how quickly
illegal markets will transition to legal markets, as well as the extent to which legalization may increase
overall demand.

The Legal Cannabis Market: Key Growth Drivers

We believe that numerous factors will increase consumer penetration rates and the overall size of the
legal cannabis market. Such factors include the following.

U.S. Federal Legalization. We believe it is a question of when, not if, cannabis becomes federally
legal. We predict six developments on the path to federal legalization: (1) the FDA will begin approv-
ing individual pharmaceutical-grade drugs derived from cannabis; (2) more states will adopt medical
cannabis laws; (3) more states will adopt recreational laws; (4) the FDA will adopt routine approval
procedures for drugs with extracts of low-THC/high-CBD cannabis varieties; (5) the FDA will adopt

Carlo Allegri / Reuters 
Over roughly the past month, coverage of Bill Clinton's travels with financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have made 
their way from a thick stack of court documents into something approaching political mythology, propelled by a string of innuendo-
laced reports hinting that the former president must have been in some way complicit when he voyaged with a billionaire known for 
preying on underage girls. 
It's a story with plenty to gape at, from horrific and excruciatingly detailed allegations against Epstein to the frequent presence of a 
former president who was, after all, nearly chased from office for a (consensual) affair with an intern. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 022674 
National Enquirer 
But sometimes stories that seem too good to be true —just might be. A detailed review by a team of BuzzFeed News reporters of 
more than 2,000 pages of pleadings, depositions, affidavits, police reports, flight logs, and other documents filed in state and federal 
court found that many of the most provocative allegations about Clinton have little to no factual foundation and are exaggerated at 
best; that the documents — which appear to be the source for nearly all current reporting on this subject — themselves never suggest 
that Clinton was doing more than using his wealthy friend as a kind of global taxi service; and that many of the most lurid insinuations 
have been floated without any visible support from verifiable information. 
While it's still possible that some Rosetta stone of Clintonian depravity will surface from a pair of ongoing lawsuits involving Epstein, the 
fact that nothing even close to that has been dug up over the course of a half-dozen years of heated litigation should not be 
encouraging for Republican operatives and other Clinton critics hotly anticipating the very worst. 
One sign that the connection is a bit weak: The lawyers who have used the Clinton link to help publicize their cases have been 
markedly vague on details. 
When asked to present actual proof, Jack Scarola, the Florida attorney responsible for filing some of the most attention-grabbing 
documents that have come to light in recent weeks, warned darkly in an email of extortionate threats, power, wealth or political 
pressure. 
The time will come when all your questions will be answered, said Scarola, who represents another trial attorney suing Epstein in 
Palm Beach County Court. But that time is not now. 
Unwilling to wait, perhaps, publications on both sides of the Atlantic have gleefully dipped into those documents to publish breathless 
descriptions of Epstein's black book, which contains a host of Clinton phone numbers (along with just about every other powerful 
figure in the Western world); dissections of handwritten flight logs for the financier's private 727 aircraft that frequently capture Bubba 
at 30,000 feet; and extensive allegations from a woman, Virginia Roberts, who claims she was Epstein's sex slave as a teenager and 
whose recollection places the former commander-in-chief on Orgy Island in 2002 to participate in a sexual romp, possibly with 
women who were not yet of age.

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 022675 
Tellingly, many of those articles — which have notably increased in tempo in recent weeks following Roberts' late December accusation 
that noted attorney Alan Dershowitz was one of the men she was forced to have sex with — contain language underscoring the fact 
that none of this proves anything. It should at this stage be stressed that the Mail has no evidence to corroborate this and other 
claims made by Virginia Roberts, the Daily Mail wrote in April. Though her LinkedIn page claims a certificate in Swedish massage, 
there is no evidence that she ever actually treated Epstein to one, Gawker (in the on the 
documents to date) wrote last week. And the National Enquirerdid not appear to rely on the court record for its conclusions, instead to 
the interpretation of who noted that Bill's name is all over the legal papers, which are chock-full of sordid claims. 
Clinton's discretion on matters of sexual restraint has attained permanent notoriety, so maybe it's natural to assume that particular 
leopard doesn't change his spots. But at this point, there is simply nothing to back those sordid claims up. 
Here's what we do know: 
Jeffrey Epstein is a secretive billionaire financier and who says he never attended college but whose 
 He in New York, Florida, New Mexico, London, and Paris and also owns an island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
He has at least two private jets, including the 727. 
He has known Bill Clinton since about 1995, and his relationship with him grew stronger after he left office. There is no question they 
were friendly. Epstein's so-called black book, which is less like something out of the Heidi Fleiss affair and more what most people 
would call a phone directory, contains 21 numbers for getting in touch with Clinton, as well as emails and addresses. 
But that 92-page directory also contains exactly the range of eye-poppingly famous and powerful contacts one might expect of an 
incredibly rich, connected person who owns Manhattan's largest private residence, from Tony Blair to Elie Wiesel to Courtney Love. 
Epstein was long rumored to be a sexual libertine; It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, real estate 
personality Donald Trump of his old friend. And many of them are on the younger side.

Epstein, in his Florida sex offender photo; at right, a phone message to Epstein from a modeling agent offering Russian lessons from a 
2x8 year old girl. 
In 2006, that reputation caught up with him, when he was arrested by the Palm Beach Police on charges of sexually molesting 
numerous underage girls. Police reports in the court record show that detectives found Epstein regularly paid very young women to 
give him massages that he turned into sexual encounters. He allegedly had a preference for very young women, whom he carefully 
groomed into increasingly extreme situations, including what some, including Roberts, allege to be sexual slavery. 
In total, as possible victims of sexual abuse by Epstein, many of them teenagers at the time, including some 
younger than 14 years old. Epstein was originally charged with a variety of crimes, including sexual assault, rape, and witness 
tampering. 
He avoided most of those charges as well as federal prosecution in late 2007 by agreeing to plead guilty in Florida court, a deal that 
Dershowitz, who was one of Epstein's lawyers, helped negotiate along with an all-star legal lineup that interestingly also included 
famed Clinton-hunter Ken Starr. 
In the end, Epstein got 18 months in prison for a single count of soliciting an underage prostitute, of which he served 13 months. He is 
now a registered sex offender who lists his primary residence as the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
In a pleading late last month in federal court, attorneys for Roberts allege that Dershowitz helped negotiate an agreement with a 
provision that provided protection for himself against criminal prosecution. Dershowitz has denied these charges vigorously, calling 
them salacious and false and, possibly more importantly, completely irrelevant in a Jan. 12 filing. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 022678 
Despite what some called among the most exhaustive investigations in Palm Beach Police history — which dug up such evidence as an 
Amazon receipt for Epstein's purchase of titles including Training With Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Exotic Slaves and Their 
Owners — there is nothing in the police record suggesting any other men were involved in Epstein's predatory behavior.

The criminal case provoked numerous lawsuits from women alleging they were victims of Epstein's proclivities, followed by 
settlements with more than two dozen of them. One firm bringing some of those cases employed a young lawyer named Bradley 
Edwards, who managed some of the cases. In 2009, a founding partner at the firm, Scott Rothstein, fled the country before ultimately 
returning to built around recruiting investors to buy stakes in litigation settlements 
that turned out to be phony. 
As details of the fraud emerged, Epstein sued Rothstein and Edwards in Palm Beach County Court for racketeering, alleging, among 
other things, that they dangled Bill Clinton's association with Epstein as a lure to investors, implying that settlements would be fast and 
sizable. Epstein ultimately dropped his suit in 2012, but by that time, Edwards had countersued for malicious prosecution and abuse of 
process. 
That case, along with a claim by Virginia Roberts against the federal government over the 2007 prosecution deal in district court (which 
she filed as a Jane Doe in 2008), are still pending and are the source of most of the scant information about Clinton that has 
appeared. Scarola, who in the past 
over payments to violent leftist Colombian rebels and won over 
Morgan Stanley (that was later overturned), is the lawyer bringing the suit in county court in West Palm Beach, while Paul Cassell, a 
former federal judge known for his critical take on mandatory-minimum sentences, mans the federal case four blocks away. 
Neither Cassell nor Edwards responded to requests for comment. 
It is primarily from pleadings in those cases that the press has been getting a glimpse inside the lifestyle of Epstein, and, by extension, 
Clinton. Edwards had sound legal basis for believing former President Clinton had relevant and discoverable information, part of one 
. Roberts, in her case, to be sexually exploited by Defendant's adult male peers, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 022679 
including royalty, politicians, academicians, businessmen, and/or other professional and personal acquaintances, which, Edwards 
elsewhere claims, are categories Clinton and acquaintances of Clinton fall into. 
Police reports entered into the record go into stomach-wrenching detail about Epstein's alleged exploits with the girls and women he 
recruited and paid for massages that became sexual acts, and mention other women participating as well. Epstein's longtime friend, 
the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, is accused of taking part, while his personal assistant, Sarah Kellen, is described procuring young 
woman for him. 
But neither of those women has ever said a word about Clinton being involved. Maxwell, for her part, has never been deposed. She 
canceled a deposition in 2010, claiming she had to return to England indefinitely due to family illness, but was soon thereafter 
photographed by Us Weekly at Chelsea Clinton's wedding in Rhinebeck, New York.

For her part, Kellen, who won immunity from prosecution along with Epstein in 2007, did sit for a deposition, but repeatedly pleaded 
the Fifth, refusing to even say if she'd ever even met the former president. 
Epstein's much-discussed flight logs show fairly conclusively that she has. 
A review of the handwritten documents shows Clinton taking 13 trips in Epstein's specially outfitted Boeing 727, including a much-
discussed trip to Africa with Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker. In every single instance, the logs show, Kellen was also on the plane, as 
was Epstein. That may sound suspicious, except for the fact that Kellen has been described as Epstein's right hand, profoundly involved 
in his professional activities as well as personal ones. Indeed, Doug Band, Clinton's personal aide, was on all but one of the flights the 
former president took on Epstein's jet.

Among the other people who most frequently flew with Clinton are Maxwell and Adriana Ross (formerly Adriana Mucinska), another 
Epstein assistant and a former model. The logs also show him flying with former advisor Ira Magaziner, ex-Transportation Secretary 
Rodney Slater, and fashion model Naomi Campbell. 
The pilots' documents also leave numerous and — understandably — intriguing questions unanswered: Clinton was on four flights with 
women identified as only Janice and Jessica, who have not been identified; he once flew with a person identified only as one 
female and also, during part of the trip throughout Africa, a young woman named Chauntae Davies, who appears in Epstein's phone 
directly under the massage category and whose expertise in Swedish massage was described in Gawkels story mentioning her last 
week. And because the entries are hand-written in a very cramped log form, it's impossible to know if important names ended up 
illegible or left out altogether, nor if there are other logs that have not been revealed. 
But based on what's in the court files, there are no further clues about those flights, other than the testimony and public statements of 
Roberts, who has described the airplane as a kind of high-altitude Gomorrah. What is on the record is a deposition of Larry Visoski, one 
of Epstein's former pilots, who recalls having Clinton on his plane as many as 20 times. When asked, Do you remember him being on 
the airplane with younger girls? Visoski replies, simply, No. 
Clinton flew literally around the world with Epstein, traveling from New York to London, to Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, Morocco, 
Portugal, Russia, and throughout Africa. In almost every case, according to cross-referenced information on his speaking engagements, 
Clinton was apparently traveling for professional reasons, and, according to the logs, he never flew with his wealthy friend anywhere 
near the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
That does little to bolster statements by Roberts, who in a 2011 conversation with her lawyers (which both New York Posts Page Six 
and Radar Online described as an interview) claimed Clinton traveled to Epstein's infamous retreat on Little St. James Island in 2002. 
Earlier this month, it was reported that Roberts is writing a tell-all memoir about her experiences. In a sworn affidavit filed in court 
last week, she claimed to have had sex with Epstein, Dershowitz, England's Prince Andrew, and several other men on numerous 
occasions, and portrayed a three-year period ending in 2002 when Epstein passed her off to his friends continually. But, she added, I 
have never had sexual relations with Clinton, nor have I claimed to have had such relations. I have never seen him have sexual 
relations with anyone.

Intensive coverage prompted by the court filings has hinted that Clinton abruptly ceased his flying with Epstein in 2005, not terribly 
long before he was arrested, perhaps because of events related to Epstein's sexual abuse of children. The implication is that Clinton 
may have known trouble of the worst kind was coming and decided to get out while he could. In fact, the logs show all of Clinton's 
flights came in 2002 and 2003, with not a single appearance aloft recorded in 2004 or 2005. 
The closest potential link to Clinton in the period closer to Epstein's fall, the public record suggests, comes from one of his longtime 
confidants, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. 
The flight logs indicate Summers flew on Epstein's jet as far back as 1998, but also on April 15, 2004, September 14, 2005, and 
December 21, 2005. The final trip came 10 days after Summers got married, and the log for the flight — from Bedford, Massachusetts, 
to the Virgin Islands — shows what appears to be his new bride on board, as well as Ghislaine Maxwell, but not Epstein.

Palm Beach County Court 
Epstein was a significant donor to Harvard University, of which Summers was president at the time. According to a spokesperson for 
Summers, on a few occasions when Epstein was flying to where Summers was also traveling, he accepted rides on the billionaire's jet. 
Attorneys in the two cases have attempted to get the court to permit discovery from Clinton himself, but have been stymied by motions 
from Epstein's lawyers. Court records show they have also tried unsuccessfully to depose Donald Trump, former New Mexico Gov. Bill 
Richardson, former Sony Music head Tommy Mottola, and magician David Copperfield. Notably, a list of 73 proposed witnesses in 
Roberts' trial does not include Clinton. 
The tale of Epstein and his sexual activities is undoubtedly a fascinating, and harrowing, one. But with the star witness in one case 
swearing under oath that she has no such evidence, and everyone else in a position to know keeping their mouths firmly shut, it is at 
this point extremely difficult to draw even a hazy, crooked, dotted line between Epstein's depredations, in the bedroom or aloft, and 
William Jefferson Clinton.

only add to existing concerns about pension
funding levels.

While there is clearly no shortage of risks, the
silver lining to last year’s rout is that we begin
2017 with a much larger valuation buffer to help
absorb them. As seen in Exhibit 83, the ratio
of municipal yields to Treasury yields is above
average for both 5- and 10-year maturities. In
turn, investors can currently earn an extra 70
basis points of after-tax yield by owning five-
year municipal bonds instead of same-maturity
Treasuries—a yield pickup more than double the
post-crisis median of 31 basis points. Moreover,
this incremental after-tax yield would still be
around 50 basis points if the top individual tax on
investment income were reduced by 10 percentage
points—from 43.4% with the Affordable
Care Act (ACA) tax to 33% under new policy
recommendations. In short, municipal spreads
currently offer a potential offset to rising rates and
potential tax changes.

Also keep in mind that municipal fundamentals
remain stable. Major state and local tax revenues
have continued to increase at a moderate 3% pace,
which should be supported by the above-trend
US economic growth and rising home prices we
forecast. Meanwhile, governments have exercised
restraint on capital spending. Consider that net
issuance expectations of $30 billion for 2017 stand
well below the pre-crisis 10-year annual average
of $110 billion.'!5 This restraint has not only kept

net supply low—as new issuance has been largely
offset by maturing debt—but has also helped
municipal finances. Ratings trends have improved
as a result of both stable revenue and spending
discipline, with upgrades in the Moody’s universe
seeing a notable uptick in last year’s third quarter
(see Exhibit 84).

Of course, underfunded long-term pension
liabilities remain a source of concern. But with
aggregate funding levels holding steady at around
74%, we do not think this will be a primary focus
in 2017, particularly given last year’s increase in
stock prices. While rising equity values will do
little to remedy municipals’ inadequate funding
contributions, they will help increase the value
of pension assets. Moreover, these medium-term
concerns are not the primary driver of recent
municipal bond weakness. After all, today’s
funding levels are no worse than they were in
October of last year, a time when municipal bonds
were enjoying some of their best returns ever.

All told, we expect intermediate municipal
strategies to gain about 1% in 2017. With
this return close to that of cash but with more
downside potential, we still think it makes sense
for clients to fund various tactical tilts from their
high-quality municipal bond allocation. This
recommendation is motivated primarily by rate
risk and not credit concerns, since we expect
municipal defaults to be rare events. Outside
tilt funding, we recommend clients target their

if only one photon is traveling at a time, still no light comes out in one
direction and all the photons come out the other. The wave functions
of each photon interfere with each other constructively or destructively.
The only conclusion available is the photon must be traveling along both
paths! They are said to be in ‘superposition. If you introduce a measuring
device half way around the experiment, it will destroy the superposition
and the photons behave in the common sense way. Remove the measuring
device and, once again, the photons seem to take both paths. Richard
Feynman pointed out that you really have to imagine that the photons
take every possible path, not only the straight line paths. He received his
Nobel Prize for demonstrating how to add up these infinite paths to get
a finite answer with his ‘sum over histories method. Superposition is a
strange idea when limited to the realm of small particles but what about
larger things? — cats for example.

Erwin Schrédinger’s unfortunate cat is trotted out to demonstrate
the paradox so often that Stephen Hawking is on record for wanting to
reach for a gun every time he hears mention of it.

The thought experiment works like this. A cat is put in a box with
a radioactive substance, a Geiger counter and a vial of poison. If the
counter detects a radioactive decay it breaks the bottle and the cat dies, if
no decay is detected the cat lives.

The Strange Binary of Dominance and Submission

It's been a while since I felt simultaneously very into someone, and very sure about him.
It's a strange feeling. I've been playing with theories about how flirtation is basically an
exercise in strategic ambiguity” and insecurity is an integral part of romantic
intoxication and uncertainty is an emotional amplifier, and I do think that those ideas
are true in many ways. But I got so wrapped up in theory that I forgot how it feels to be
way into someone... and only a little bit scared.

te OK ok

I met Mica at a Saturday night party. When I left the next morning, he said he wanted to
see me again as soon as possible. Monday? he asked. Tuesday?

Monday, I said. Tomorrow.

He's a smart, creative thinker. There are layers to him, and he practically shines: so why
not name him for the mineral Mica? I would love talking to him for those reasons alone.
But there's also a kind of certainty to him; a calm presence; an extraordinary quality of
attention. Once he's focused on a partner, there's a rhythm behind everything he does.
He's so precise that when I'm kissing him, I feel like an awkward puppy.

I observed this very quickly, and something else: that the quality of his attention -- often
overtook him. Controlled him. In a sexual interaction, it's difficult to distract him from
catering to me. And since he’s excellent at reading my desires, I usually don't want to
distract him.

It made me think of what I was like, years ago, before I understood my submissive
tendencies. Mica hadn't done much explicit S&M before, and when he'd done it, he was
dominant. I didn't want to project too much, or make any assumptions about him... but I
couldn't help noticing.

The second night I was with him, I asked him to inflict light pain on me. Very light. I
didn't want to go further with him, yet. But his instincts for delivering pain and watching
my reactions were, as I suspected, beautifully calibrated.

The third night I was with him, he touched my face and kissed me. I felt my eyelashes
flutter and my body melt, and he smiled. Then he said, I'm feeling really gentle tonight. I
don't know how much I'm up for.”

He doesn't want S&M right now, I thought. Sometimes guys date me and get anxious that
I'll be disappointed when they don't want to do S&M. This is understandable, given that
I'm an S&M writer. But I hate that, because the last thing I want is for one of my partners
to feel obligated... and besides, even I don't want all-S&M_-all-the-time. I smiled directly
into Mica's eyes and told him I was fine with it.

In bed, I watched him. Watched his extraordinary attentiveness. Eventually we got to a
point where I was leaning over him, kissing him. I watched him give up his body to the
kiss. He doesn't want S&M right now, I thought... except that his main experience with
S&M, so far, is being in charge.

plan, Ms. Robson would be contacted when Epstein was planning to be at his Palm Beach residence
or soon after he had arrived there. Epstein or someone on his behalf directed Ms. Robson to bring
one or more underage girls to the residence. Ms. Robson, upon information and belief, generally
sought out economically disadvantaged underage girls from Loxahatchee and surrounding areas who
would be enticed by the money being offered - generally $200 to $300 per “massage” session - and
who were perceived as less likely to complain to authorities or have credibility if allegations of
improper conduct were made. This was an important element of Epstein’s plan.

13. Epstein’s plan and scheme reflected a particular pattern and method. Upon arrival at
Epstein’s mansion, Mr. Robson would introduce each victim to Sarah Kellen, Epstein’s assistant,
who pathered the girl’s personal information, including her name and telephone number. Ms. Kellen
would then bring the girl up a flight of stairs to a bedroom that contained a massage table in addition
to other fumishings. There were photographs of nude women lining the stairway hall and in the
bedroom. Ms. Kellen would then leave the girl alone in this room, whereupon Epstein would enter
wearing only a towel. He would then remove his towel, lay down naked on the massage table, and
direct the girl to remove her clothes. He then would perform one or more lewd, lascivious and
sexual acts, including masturbation and touching the girl’s vagina with a vibrator.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013527.txt,"down” the expansive flow back onto the road, the entire constrictive field called the
stable manifold. This influence herds points into shadowing the main road of the
dynamics, like the hair of the dog that stay close to the real body of the animal in
motion. It is in this way that just a few often slightly off the mark points nonetheless
shadow the real (called fiduciary) orbits of the attractor, outlining its global geometry
with just a little information.

The intuitive reason shadowing works Is built into these natural countervailing
tendencies of hyperbolic dynamics, which on one hand tends to spread out nearby
initial points and brings disparate others together. The latter inclination is the one
that smoothes down the escaping points onto surfaces of actions that
mathematicians call manifolds. However, the details of the orbital paths don’t look
that orderly due to the mixing of the sequence of points in hyperbolic motion. The
mixing process on manifolds has been analogized to that of the bundled pink loops
of the stretching (expanding) and folding (contracting) taffy puller at the carnival
candy stand. The process gets sequences of small particles of candy out of
sequential order while maintaining the taffy’s overall geometrically ovoid shape.
Disorder is local with the entropy being generated by the repeatedly shuffling of the
line up of the original orbital sequence. This results in the impossibility of any point-
to-point prediction for more than a few points even though the over all shape is
maintained. Exactly what minute a habitually late sleeper awakes can’t be
predicted. On the other hand, the skeletal manifold of the global structure is entirely
in evidence from almost the beginning. Late risers remain late risers even without a
precise, minute-to-minute, predictable schedule.

It is also interesting that a uniformly hyperbolic dynamical system, unlike the
fixed-point attractors of stylistic fixation, resist perturbation-induced changes in
global dynamical form. In an apparent paradox worthy of metaphysical allusion, the
dynamically hyperbolic kind of formlessness has structural stability. The global
geometric predictability of this point-to-point, completely unpredictable system can

terrible idea.

I once heard about a woman who won't allow herself to have orgasms during casual sex,
because she knows the orgasm itself will bond her to her partner. I don't experience
orgasms that way. But when a partner really puts me under with S&M, pulls me in deep,
and then he gives me aftercare while I surface? That's where I fall in love.

I've heard of polyamorous S&M relationships in which the primary relationship disallows
S&M with non-primary partners. I can certainly understand wanting to reserve that for
the primary relationship. I've also heard of polyamorous S&M relationships in which the
partners can do S&M with outside partners... but won't allow aftercare with outside
partners. I can understand that even better.

Brainwashing: Intimacy Within Abuse

In late 2010, I cross-posted an article about an intense S&M experience to the blog
Feministe. In the article, I included these words:

There it was. I felt the tears building, gasps torn from my throat, I felt myself starting to
fall apart and reform: around him, around his guidance and force and demands. Almost
unable to think. Until finally he relented and said my name, and said softly, Come
back, and ran his hand reassuringly down my hair.

There it was: the reason I want it so much.

In response, a commenter named FormerWildChild wrote:

For some of us, the idea of being hit by another person makes us want to jump up and
run out of our skin. It seriously wigs us out. It is not a moral judgment; is a true phobia
for another person. It reminds me of when we were at the un-civilized end of Grand
Canyon with our children. All that stood between my kids and certain death was inches
of loosely packed sand. When we were done sightseeing, I discreetly walked behind the
van and threw up until I could breathe again.

I had that same terrified feeling when I read about your account of your last session. I
wanted to go wrap a blanket around you, hold you in my arms and feed you tea and
cookies until I can finally breathe again.

And my fear is not because I fail to really get what you experience. It comes from an
absolute recognition of what you describe.

I have experienced what you described at the end of your BDSM session, the breaking
and reforming of yourself around someone. I have felt exactly what you are talking
about, that feeling of finally letting go, of surrendering, and the other person sensing that
you are finally there, and then stopping. I have felt the sweetness of those moments of
post-thrashing closeness when tenderness seems to hover in the room. I know the feeling
of intense closeness which can follow the next day. The air is filled with a cathartic
cleanness, the experience of inflicting pain and of receiving pain has cleared the air
better than any southern thunderstorm. I can even imagine coming to crave that feeling

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016002.txt,"312 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?

How often do you hear the phrase, “It's down to tradeoffs,” or “It’s a
matter of priorities’, or even “You can't have your cake and eat it?”

These stock statements misunderstand the infinitely complex nature
of creativity and problem solving. Let us take a concrete example: the car.

My first car was a Volkswagen Polo. It was a great little car, quite
nippy, cassette-radio, and four seats. The most recent Polo has antilock
brakes, airbags, NCAP 5-star crash resistance, smarter styling, and a low
emission engine. Shall I go on...? The doctrine of tradeoffs says I would
have to give up something to gain these new features. But, I have not.
The newer Polo is cheaper in real terms than my original, as well as being
better designed.

Problems always have at least two dimensions of freedom. We can
trade one feature for another or we can innovate to both have our cake
and eat it! We are never constrained to simple on-the-one-hand, on-the-
other-hand type decisions. Creativity is unconstrained by linear rules
and tradeoffs.

Process versus Creativity
How many times have you heard the words, “We must create a process
for this!”

In its place, process is good; It makes things consistent, repeatable
and predictable. You can follow a process by rote without error. Processes
are also easy to document and communicate because they are symbolic.
But process is limited. It is, after all, a set of prescribed rules for solving a
particular problem — and, because of this, it falls into the same trap.

A process cannot solve a problem that requires creative thought or
logic more complex than the logic limit. Logical processes are useful for
tracking lists. I am reassured when I get on an airplane and know the
pilot has been through a preflight checklist. I would not want to fly in an
airplane where the pilot announced he was taking a creative approach to
the preflight check.

Process is a perfect tool for organizing the steps around being
creative, but it won't do the creating for you.

I appreciate the opportunity to respond to your email. While I am running the risk that you will report my comments, if you do, either out 
of context, or incompletely, I am responding with an effort to be complete. It is hard to know how to respond to a list of false and/or 
distorted allegations, along with misleading statements on your part. I treat people I interact with with respect, and I work hard to 
support and mentor students, colleagues, and members of the general public. I do not sexually harass people. If the purpose of your 
reporting is to somehow argue that Universities and other institutions are lax in dealing with well known individuals like myself, then in 
fact the situation is quite the opposite. My high public profile opens me up to more scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it also 
opens me up to a host of outside complaints and allegations that other faculty do not receive, each of which the University has to 
respond to. The fact that I have remained a professor in all Universities with which I have been associated, in good standing, and also 
an officer or an invited speaker at organizations like CFI, which have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the fact that they 
trust my behavior. I was asked to be an honorary director of CFI, and invited to their last 3 meetings to speak, specifically because, as 
they have written me after the fact, the attendees universally appreciated my talks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time 
with the attendees. If the purpose of your report is to impugn my integrity or suggest I have a history of harassment, that too is 
false. As noted in one of your 'miscellaneous facts', as a scientist I try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather than 
allegations and innuendo. I also try and judge the facts in context. The fact that Universities and other organizations employ me or 
have me on their boards, or invite me to meetings is because they value my contributions and my actions. 
The items you list are false or distorted. Item 1 refers falsely and inaccurately to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 
where we mutually decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, and there were respectful 
and platonic encounters afterwards. There is nothing to comment on in item 3, which involves an anonymous 3rd party claim because I 
know nothing about it, there are no details provided, and it clearly was not taken seriously enough to result in any university 
action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying that because I decided I didn't want to go out to a bar with a group of attendees that I was 
harassing them? The second part did not happen. Re incident 5: The 'female companion' in this case is my wife, who can attest to the 
fact that the claim is false, which is what I wrote at the time in response to the blog in question, causing it to be taken down. 
It is worth responding to Item 2 and 6 in more detail, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021408 
Re item 2: the student in question was interested in science communication, and on dozens of occasions came to me or wrote to me 
with questions. When she asked about advice for after graduation I DID tell her she was different than the other students in her 
year. The rest of them were interested in going on to graduate school, but she was interested in science communication so I told her 
that she might want to take a different path. Since she was the only woman in her year, as I recall, I did ask her on one of these 
occasions if that made it difficult for her in any way. I asked, because as a faculty member I was interested in knowing what we could 
do, if necessary to encourage more women to go into physics, and also because as someone she had asked for career advice from I 
wanted to know if that made a difference to her. Re asking her for dinner.. I have gone back over emails from that period. I have 
numerous requests from her asking me to go for coffee to talk, which I usually had to turn down because I was busy, and on several 
occasions sh specifically asked me to have coffee with her off campus to talk, and I politely declined. I did let her accompany me off 
campus one time to watch me do a BBC interview because she specifically requested it. I did and do have coffee and meals with 
students on campus, and I see nothing wrong with this. I try to treat even students as respected colleagues if possible. I was shocked 
when I later learned of the complaint she was apparently asked to lodge to the University, not least because there was no inappropriate 
interaction and also because, well after the dates you listed on which she was apparently offended, she continued to email me with 
joking questions or comments. Also, at a later AAAS conference, again in 2008, for which she had asked, and for which I had written 
her a letter of recommendation to attend, my wife and I gave her a lift in our taxi well out out of our way in order to drop her off at her 
hotel, and I note in an email response to her email about the conference, agin in 2008, I expressed that I would pass her regards along 
to my wife and vice versa. When the University later informed me of the complaint I was shocked and concerned. When I spoke to 
the human resources person, including relating my concerns and providing the emails in question, I was told that no formal complaint 
of sexual harassment was deemed at that time to be called for, and that the young woman in question had agreed to that. By that time 
I learned of the complaint I had already announced my intentions to leave Case to accept an offer at ASU—a very difficult decision for 
me because of my long-standing attachment to the University, and the excellent relations I had with my colleagues there, both among 
the faculty and among the administration. Because I was already in Arizona at the time I was asked not to have any further interaction 
with the student I agreed to that request, both to respect her sensitivities and also because it was basically moot because I was not on 
campus. I was also told that because it was being handled informally, that (a) it should remain confidential, which I, at least abided by, 
and (b) if no further complaints were lodged in that case, that the University would remove the complaint from my record after 5 years, 
which makes me surprised that someone violated that written agreement with you. 
Re item 6: You report on ASU's response to item #6 , without including the fact that the University specifically stated there were never 
any allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment by me at the University, and morever the outside complaints were in fact related 
specifically to your item #6. Further you neglect to mention that this complaint was by an anonymous third party, not the individual who 
was allegedly harassed, who never lodged a complaint, and that no specific evidence was provided of the alleged transgression. I was 
surprised and dismayed that both ASU and ANU launched investigations on the basis of this but was told by both Universities that 
because of my high profile even such unsubstantiated third party complaints at private events unrelated to the University would be 
investigated. The complaint was investigated throughly by both ASU and ANU and both came to the conclusion that it was not credible 
and no university policies had been violated. . In addition ANU's investigation, which took a full month found significant inconsistencies 
in the allegation, suggesting distortion and fabrication, I will quote from the ANU report. The initial complaint, which in fact resulted in a 
temporary suspension of my position at ANU, until it was dismissed, outlined the claim you made in the words you quoted in your note 
to me, but it also stated 
It is the University's understanding that a complaint was lodged directly to the conference organisers at the time of the incident. 
After the month-long investigation, during which I was told I was not to interact with anyone on campus (again moot because I was a 
hemisphere removed) the final report absolved me of any wrongdoing, and indicated information inconsistent with the original claim and 
apparent later claims as follows in the report, from which I quote: 
The allegations were made by an observer to the incident. 
- The complaint did not identify, nor disclose the identity of the conference attendee who was allegedly touched in 
an unwelcome manner. 
- The conference attendee who took the selfie' photo did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference organisers 
at the time of the incident (November 2016). 
- The conference attendee who witnessed the incident, did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference organisers 
at the time of the incident (November 2016). 
The photo submitted as part of the complaint does not provide evidence of any physical contact. 
- The complainant alleged that a photo exists, showing your hand on the breast of the conference attendee who took 
the selfie' photo. This photo was not made available to the Australian National University, although it was requested 
in the course of the investigation. 
(And for the record I often put my hand up in front of a camera if there is a flash, as I specifically request selfies not to include flashes, 
so that I don't end up with a series bright spots in front of my eyes for the next half hour) 
What makes this particular type of allegation so repugnant is that I get asked for literally thousands of selfies, and when people come 
up to me they are vulnerable, often shaking, and sometimes overly aggressive. I am particularly proud of the way I attempt to make all 
people feel at ease, and respected, rather than humiliated. Thus, this false claim strikes at the heart of what I am about, which is to 
acknowledge fans in a way that makes them feel appreciated. As I understand you had a reporter watching me sign books and take 
selfies at the CFI conference in Las Vegas this year, that behavior is what they will have witnessed. Moreover, I am proud of the 
interactions I have had at both Case and ASU, with students, colleagues and staff of all genders and ethnicities. I have worked hard to 
support them, mentor them, and treat them with respect. I treat others as responsible adults, and I expect to be treated equally.

Subject: URGENT: BuzzFeed News inquiry re allegations of sexual harassment 
Date: December 10, 2017 at 5:12:27 PM PST 
To 
Dr. Krauss: 
As you know, I'm a reporter for BuzzFeed News who has been investigating sexual misconduct allegations 
against you. As we've already discussed by email, I'd very much like to interview you about these allegations in 
detail. 
In particular, you stated in an email sent on Nov 13 that two universities had investigated an incident (# 6 
below). You claimed that both Universities independently concluded that the report was unsubstantiated and 
fabricated with malicious intent. We are not aware that either university concluded fabrication or malicious 
intent, so if you have evidence to support this assertion, we would like to see and discuss it. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021411 
The story concerns your actions towards students while a professor of physics at Case Western Reserve 
University, as well as your conduct in non-academic settings as a prominent figure in the skeptics movement. I 
am reporting this story along with two of my colleagues on the science desk, Azeen Ghorayshi and Virginia 
Hughes. 
Our story is about several allegations of sexual misconduct dating from 2006 to 2016 (see full details below). 
Our reporting also goes into how the various institutions you have been affiliated with — Case Western, 
Arizona State University, the Australian National University, the New College of the Humanities, and the Center 
for Inquiry, for which you serve as an honorary member of the board of directors — have handled complaints 
and concerns about your behavior during this time. 
Our story is corroborated by emails, university documents, official complaints, testimony from victims and 
eyewitnesses, and interviews with more than two dozen of your current and former academic colleagues, 
students, and peers in the skeptics movement. 
I wanted to offer you the opportunity to comment and/or respond to the main facts we plan to publish. If you 
wish to comment on any of the below findings, we need to hear from you as soon as possible. We are 
planning on publishing our story Tuesday morning, Eastern US Time. 
Based on our reporting, this is what we plan to publish: 
Incident 1: 
• In November of 2006, at an event launching the new Center for Inquiry in Washington D.C., you met a 
volunteer for CFI D.C. 
• At the event, you asked for her business card. Later, you followed her as she was leaving and asked 
her if she was of age. 
• Later, you emailed her to invite her to dinner. 
• You planned to dine with her in the restaurant at the Washington D.C. hotel where you were staying. 
• You told her to come up to your room first because you needed to finish some work. 
• In your hotel room, you seemed in no rush to leave. You ordered a cheese plate, and later champagne, 
despite her suggestion that you go down to dinner. 
• You then made a comment about her eye makeup, getting very close to her face. 
• You then lifted her by her arms, and pushed her onto the bed beneath you, forcibly kissing her and 
trying to pull down the crotch of her tights. 
• She struggled to push you off her. 
• You said, When I was in college I could never get a girl that looked like you. 
• When you pulled out a condom, she got out from under you. She said I have to go, and rushed out of 
the room. 
Incident 2: 
• In an incident that occurred in fall of 2007 while you were a physics professor at Case Western Reserve 
University, a student tried to talk to you about her plans after graduation. You mentioned to her how tough it 
must be to have all the other physics majors asking her out on dates. 
• In a second incident in December of 2007, while you were still at Case Western, the same student 
visited your office to interview you for a student science journal. You closed the door behind her, and ignored 
the questions she had prepared. Then you made a casual comment about taking her out for dinner. 
• Later, in a regular column for the school paper, she described her experiences with you, without 
mentioning you by name. There was even one particular creep of a professor who once told me he thought 
differently of me compared to other students and asked me to dinner: a situation so disturbing that it left me 
upset for weeks afterward, she wrote. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021412 
• She was then approached by a dean at the university, who suspected that she was referring to you, 
based on a previously reported incident with another student. He encouraged her to make a complaint, and 
she did. 
• University investigators interviewed both you and the student. 
• On September 4, 2008, Susan Nickel-Schindewolf, the university's associate vice president for student 
affairs, wrote to the student, telling her that the investigation was complete. She wrote that you had been told: 
This type of behavior could constitute sexual harassment in violation of the university's sexual harassment 
policy. 
• The letter also stated that you were prohibited from making contact with the student as long as she 
remained at Case. 
11 
• The letter also stated that you are required to get approval from the dean or the chair of the physics 
department before setting foot on the campus again. 
• The letter also stated, Dr. Krauss expressed regret about having a negative impact on you, and also 
his willingness to use this complaint as an opportunity to reflect and improve on his future interactions with 
students. 
• By then, you had already left Case, taking up your current position at Arizona State University the 
month before. 
• The opportunities being offered at ASU are simply too great to turn down at this stage in my career, 
you told Case colleagues, in an email announcing your departure on April 16, 2008. 
Incident 3: 
• A former Case Western physics department administrator confirmed that she had reported a previous 
incident involving a student who had confided in her about your inappropriate behavior towards her. 
Incident 4: 
• You met a student from another university, an atheist activist, in March 2008 at the American Atheists 
Convention in Minneapolis. She wanted to expand the atheist group she ran at the midwestern university she 
was attending, and hoped to convince you to come and speak. You initially seemed enthusiastic. 
• During the convention, attendees including you and Richard Dawkins went for dinner with the student 
and volunteers for Dawkins' foundation. 
• Afterwards, the student invited you to join the volunteers for a drink. 
• You asked her to come get you in your hotel room. She was wary of your intentions, and so brought a 
male friend with her. Opening the door to find them both there, you informed her you had decided not to go.

• She tried to shift her body away from you, and you persisted in putting your hand on her leg. She 
crossed her legs, and you kept trying. Then she turned her entire body away. 
Incident 5: 
• This incident allegedly occurred on in May 2011 on a CFI cruise. We understand that CFI staff were 
informed that you had propositioned a female cruise-goer, who rejected an invitation to join you and your 
female companion for sex in your cabin. 
• At least two CFI staffers were sufficiently concerned about reports of your behavior that they urged 
CFI's president not to invite you on a 2014 cruise of the Galapagos Islands. You were invited on that cruise, 
however. 
Incident 6: 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021413 
• During a visit to Melbourne, Australia, in November 2016, you were accused of sexual misconduct once 
again. 
• The incident happened at a dinner held at the Melbourne Zoo as part of the Australian Skeptics  
National Convention, where you were a featured speaker. 
• With conference delegates chatting over drinks, a woman asked you for a celebrity selfie. 
• As the woman held out her phone to take the picture, you reached over her shoulder and grabbed her 
right breast. 
• She immediately reacted, bodychecking you and spinning around. Don't do that, she said. 
• BuzzFeed News has seen the complaint made by another woman to ASU, ANU, and the New College 
of the Humanities in London, including the selfie, her face obscured to conceal her identity. It shows your hand 
in motion as a blur in front of her shoulder, apparently moving toward her chest. Two other eyewitnesses have 
confirmed the complainant's account of what happened. 
• In April 2017, the complainant described the incident on her blog. After hearing more about your 
reputation for inappropriate behavior from blog readers, she decided to file a complaint about the Nov. 2016 
incident. 
• On July 16, she filed formal complaints with Arizona State University, and with the Australian National 
University in Canberra and the New College of the Humanities in London, where you have visiting 
appointments. 
• Both Arizona State and the Australian National University told her they would look into the matter. But 
neither university found against you. 
• Based on the material available to the University, we do not have sufficient evidence to substantiate 
the allegations, Kiaran Kirk, dean of the College of Science at the Australian National University, wrote to her. 
• Erin Ellison, who heads Arizona State's Office of Equity & Inclusion, wrote to her explaining that an 
inquiry did not find a violation of university policy. 
• In October, Arizona State denied a request from BuzzFeed News for documents relating to complaints 
of sexual harassment against you. However, Cynthia Jewett, the university's senior associate general counsel, 
noted that two individuals, neither affiliated with the university, had complained about you. The University did 
not find either communication to state a credible allegation, Jewett wrote. 
Miscellaneous facts: 
• In 2008, you founded the Origins Project at Arizona State University in Tempe, a multidisciplinary effort 
to understand the origins of the universe, life, and social systems. You have led that effort ever since. 
• Thanks to best-selling books like The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe From Nothing, frequent 
essays in publications including the New Yorker and the New York Times, and the documentary you made with 
biologist Richard Dawkins, called The Unbelievers, you are celebrated as one of America's leading public 
intellectuals. 
• You served on the science policy committee for Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign and are a 
vocal critic of President Donald Trump. 
• You also make regular public appearances across the world, often at gatherings of skeptics and 
atheists. 
• At CSICon in Las Vegas in October, a few dozen fans paid $500 per head to attend a VIP luncheon 
with you and Dawkins. 
• Many more lined up to get you to sign their copy of your latest book, The Greatest Story Ever Told — 
So Far. 
• Online, people can buy T-shirts emblazoned Lawrence Krauss for President. 
• In talks and interviews, you have argued that our universe arose without divine intervention, that 
religion drives xenophobia, and that our brains are hardwired to believe. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 021414 
• You have stated that science provides answers to many of life's biggest questions, and can even fix 
great societal injustices. 
• Earlier this year, at a Q&A event to promote your new book, the conversation came around to the 
dearth of women and minorities in science. Science itself overcomes misogyny and prejudice and bias, you 
said. It's built in: Questioning yourself, always questioning results, questioning others, relying on empirical 
evidence. 
• You have clashed with some skeptics over your defense of Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire financier who in 
2008 was convicted for soliciting prostitution from underage girls, and spent 13 months in a Florida jail. 
• Through his private foundation, Epstein has funded the work of several prominent scientists. He has 
provided funding for your Origins Project, supporting lectureship and scholarship programs, most recently 
pledging $100,000 in 2014. 
• In April 2011, you told the Daily Beast: As a scientist I always judge things on empirical evidence and 
he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my 
presumption is that whatever the problems were I would believe him over other people. 
• In a blog comment about the Epstein controversy, you wrote: I remain skeptical, and I support a man 
whose character I believe I know.. .If you want to condemn me for that, so be it. 
• You were made an honorary member of CFI's board of directors in December 2011. 
• A blog post published in August 2013 described incidents #1 and #4, naming you. Another post, 
published at around the same time, described incident #5. 
• The first post was edited to remove your name after you had commented that the allegations of assault 
were potentially illegal. The second post was quickly taken down. 
Again, if you wish to comment on or clarify any of these points, please get in touch with us as soon as possible. 
If I do not respond immediately it is because I am on another call, so please leave the best phone number to 
reach you.

as though checking for danger. It felt like a strange mix of physical clinging and
interpersonal distantiation. Many articles in the International University Press’s
Psychoanalytic Studies of the Child book series, described these prematurely
formed child personality types: the paranoid scouts, the detached as /f children
pretending to feel, the desperate to please obsessionals, the charismatically
seductive hysterics and the unconscionable psychopaths.

Experiments simulating trauma and neglect in young animals also
demonstrate acceleration in biobehavioral development. Possibilities, the number of
available states, ©, brain entropies as S = log Q, become casualties of traumatic
and neglected early life. Like one trick ponies, these abused and abandoned
children take up singular patterns of behavior that seem to work and stick to them.
One doesn’t anticipate seeing such narrowly fixated personality patterns until late
adolescence or adulthood. They appear at ages too young to qualify for the
character pathology coding of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV. Yet the
labels of adult personality disorder seem inescapable when one sees a four-year-
old child trapped in a compulsive hand washing ritual or a panty flashing five-year-
old girl with a seductive gait.

Four-year-old Alicia rubbed the lumps in my right hip pocket containing
caramel candies. Her blue eyes twinkled. Her long blonde hair was in bangs and
her lips in a pout. She kept a hand on her hip and tilted her pelvis as she spoke.
Listening to children’s stories, she straddled the reader's thigh and rocked. Alicia
had a history of sexual abuse in a home that was a hang out for drug dealers. There
were rumors that she talked to strange men late at night on the phone. On
admission to the Center, she was found to have genital herpes. Both of her parents
had been in and out of prison for drug-related crimes. The Center’s staff spoke of
Alicia’s seductive smiles, incessant demands, irritable complaints and tantrums.
With the back of her hand held against her forehead, she said that it was too hot to
pick up the toys she had scattered around the fenced yard. Ordered to comply,
Alicia took three steps into Florida’s summer heat and fainted. Each morning, she

spent the better part of an hour in front of the mirror, trying on all four of her dresses

opposition. This approach is common
and evident in a spate of contemporary
books that take the position that science
and religion represent competing ways
of understanding the world and that
science (or religion) is the one and only
valid way of understanding human
behavior and the world around us (3-8).
For instance, in 7he God Delusion,
Richard Dawkins places specific Judeo-
Christian theological doctrines under the
scrutiny of science only to find that none
passes scientific muster.

The vast majority of people from
all educational backgrounds continue to
harbor strong religious beliefs that affect
their daily decisions and behavior, with
both good and ill effects. These
religious belief systems most commonly
bump into scientific claims around
invisible forces. When science opens up
opportunities to improve the human
condition by providing a more complete
understanding of the causes of events,
their measurable effects, and possible
interventions— ranging from valid
science education to medical
advancements based on stem cell
research — these opportunities are often
threatened by the application of specific
religious beliefs to these endeavors.
Scientific research to understand religion
and religious belief systems may be a
more productive response than broad
denouncements by scientists of any who
hold such beliefs.

Conversely, when religion opens
up opportunities for improving the
human condition by questioning the
emphasis on short-term self-interests at
the expense of the collective, providing a
more complete understanding of the
human need to attribute meaning to
events and their effects, and identifying
possible interventions— ranging from the

Page |13

provision of tangible support to
individuals in need, to the promotion of
healthy lifestyles and ethical behavior—
scientific research to understand these
influences may again be a more
productive response than broad
denouncements by scientists that such
beliefs are irrational. Indeed, the
question of whether God exists is of
much less scientific interest, and of
much more questionable scientific merit
(how would one scientifically falsify
such a claim?), than the question of the
causes, consequences, and underlying
mechanisms for the observable human
behaviors affected by invisible forces---
whether they be physical (gravity),
social (groups), or perceived spiritual

(gods).

Contemporary science explains
many of these phenomena but also
points to the human capacities and
emergent processes that derive from
collective social structures and actions
and, underlying the emergence of these
structures, the human need for meaning-
making and connecting to something
beyond oneself. The dominant metaphor
for the scientific study of the human
mind during the latter half of the 20
century has been the computer — a
solitary device with massive information
processing capacities. Computers today
are massively interconnected devices
with capacities that extend far beyond
the resident hardware and software of a
solitary computer. The extended
capacities made possible by the internet
can be said to be emergent because they
represent a whole that is greater than the
simple sum of the actions that are
possible by the sum of the individual
(disconnected) computers that constitute
the internet. The telereceptors (e.g.,
eyes, ears) of the human brain have
provided wireless broadband

I did regret being unable to rely on the support of two key constituencies that
had helped deliver my landslide victory barely 18 months earlier: my own Labor
Party and the Arab citizens of Israel. I had no trouble understanding the reasons
many Israeli Arabs were abandoning me. The clashes in the Galilee at the start of
the new intifada had left more than a dozen of their community dead. As an official
inquiry would later conclude, there was blame on all sides. A number of Arab
members of the Knesset had played a part in inciting the violence. Yet the police
had been unprepared, and they had used excessive force. As I said publicly before
the election, I, as Prime Minister, was ultimately responsible, and I formally
apologized for what had happened. Yet the roots went deeper, to the economic and
social disadvantages still faced by many Arab citizens, and the difficulty in
resolving those problems calmly and collectively as long as Israel remained in a
state of war with its Arab neighbors.

For Labor and the political left, it was as if, despite Arafat’s repeated rejections
of ever more forthcoming terms of peace, they still couldn’t bring themselves to
believe he really meant it. By default, they were inclined to blame me for not
delivering peace. I was accused of relying too much on a close circle of aides and
negotiators I’d known from my time in the army, of not giving a negotiating role to
Labor veterans of the Oslo negotiations like Yossi Beilin, and of being
insufficiently sensitive to Arafat’s needs in the negotiating process. Typical of the
argument was a broadside by the journalist and historian Tom Segev, in Haaretz,
which accused me of an “incredible arrogance” which had “led to an historic
mistake. Rather than continue on the Oslo road, Barak put it into his head that he
could reach a final settlement and try and impose it on the Palestinian Authority
President.” I did not try to “impose” anything on Arafat. I did, quite consciously,
abandon the “Oslo road” because it was inexorably leading to a situation where,
after the final Wye redeployments, Arafat would have control over the great
majority of the West Bank without having to commit to any of the assurances that
even most on the Israeli left would define as the minimum required for peace.
Now, of course, we knew that was something the Palestinian leader was not
prepared to do.

When election day came, not that many of my critics on the left actually voted
against me. Nor did the Israeli Arabs. Yet in very large numbers, they simply
didn’t vote. In percentage terms, Arik’s victory was even more decisive than mine
over Bibi. He got more than 62 percent of the vote. I received barely 37 percent.

private practice in South Florida with personal relationships to some of the prosecutors involved.
Federal prosecutors then leaked highly sensitive information about the case to a New York
Times reporter! The immediate result of this confluence of extraordinary circumstances is an
onslaught of civil lawsuits, all save one brought by the First Assistant’s former boutique law firm
in Miami.

The facts in this case all revolve around the classic state crime of solicitation of
prostitution? The State Attorney’s Office in Palm Beach County had conducted a diligent
investigation, convened a Grand Jury that returned an indictment, and made a final determination
about how to proceed. That is where, in our federal republic, this matter should rest.
Mr. Epstein faces a felony conviction in state court by virtue of his conduct, and the only reason
the State has not resolved this matter is that the federal prosecutors in Miami have continued to
insist that we, Mr. Epstein’s counsel, approach and demand from the State Attorney’s Office a
harsher charge and a more severe punishment than that Office believes are appropriate under the
circumstances. Yet despite the USAO’s refusal to allow the State to resolve this matter on the
terms the State has determined are appropriate, the USAO has not made any attempt to
coordinate its efforts with the State. In fact, the USAO mandated that any federal agreement
would be conditioned on Mr. Epstein persuading the State to seek a criminal punishment unlike
that imposed on other defendants within the jurisdiction of the State Attorney for similar
conduct.

From the inception of the USAO’s involvement in this case, which at the end of the day
is a case about solicitation of prostitution within the confines of Palm Beach County, Florida, we
have asked ourselves why the Department of Justice is involved. Regrettably, we are unable to
suggest any appropriate basis for the Department’s involvement. Mr. Epstein has no criminal
history whatsoever. Also, Mr. Epstein has never been the subject of general media interest until |
a few years ago, after it was widely perceived by the public that he was a close friend of former
President Bill Clinton.

The conduct at issue is simply not within the purview of federal jurisdiction and lies
outside the heartland of the three federal statutes that have been identified by prosecutors-~18
U.S.C. §§ 1591, 2422(b), and 2423(b).

1 One of the other members of Mr. Epstein's defense team, Jay Lefkowitz, has personally reviewed the reporter’s
contemporaneous notes.

2 Although some of the women alleged to be involved were 16 and 17 years of age, several of these women
openly admitted to lying to Mr. Epstein about their age in their recent sworn statements.

The Marriott hotel in West Palm Beach, at 1001 Okeechobee Blvd., is where U.S.
Attorney Alexander Acosta met with Jeffrey Epstein’s attorney to work out a plea
arrangement. Emily Michot emichot@miamiherald.com

November: Epstein’s lawyers object to an addendum to the agreement. The
provision called for a special master to appoint an attorney to represent Epstein
victims’ rights to civil compensation.

December: The two sides continue to debate the addendum. Epstein attorney
Kenneth Starr asks for a review of the agreement by the U.S. Department of Justice
in Washington, further delaying its execution. Victims are told the investigation is
continuing.

2008

January: Epstein attorney, Lefkowitz, calls Acosta, telling him his client will not go
through with the agreement because it requires him to register as a sex offender.

February: With the plea negotiations and the Justice Department review still in
limbo, the FBI continues its probe, locating more witnesses and evidence.

March: Preparations are made for a new federal grand jury presentation. In court
documents, the U.S. Attorney’s Office notes that Epstein’s victims are being
harassed by his lawyers, who are not specifically named.

In 2016, the chair of the Human Rights Committee of the German Parliament was
told he would not be allowed to visit China with the rest of the committee if he did
not delete a report from his home page on Tibetan flags being hoisted at German town
halls. The committee refused to go on the trip.

Academia

More than one hundred thousand Chinese nationals live in Germany, most of them
students. Intense exchanges take place between universities, research institutes,

and think tanks, as well as between scholars in many areas, both natural and social
sciences. Similar to academics from other countries, several German researchers and
academics with a reputation of being critical toward the Chinese government have
been denied visas or access to interlocutors in China. China in general targets junior
scholars for cultivation. Contacts are initiated from China with invitations to join
research projects, apply for grants, attend conferences, and write articles with the
promise that they will be published.

A notable instance of coercion occurred when the publishing company Springer Nature
removed an estimated one thousand publications from its Internet catalog for China
because their titles might not coincide with official political positions of Beijing. So far,
Springer has yet to reverse its decision, unlike Cambridge University Press in a similar
instance.

German universities host twenty Confucius Institutes (out of approximately 160 in
all of Europe). Like their counterparts elsewhere, they invest more in gaining general
sympathy in German civil society through cultural activities than in advancing an
overtly political agenda (which does occur, although rarely). There are fifty-eight
Chinese Students and Scholars Associations in Germany that are well organized and
seemingly well funded.

Civil Society

Chinese officials regularly complain about the negative attitude toward China in the
German public, proven by polls, but do not yet tackle the problem directly. Activities
in the PRC by German nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and political
foundations are increasingly confined in their activities, not only through China’s
new NGO law but also because former Chinese partners are reluctant to cooperate.

In a letter to the interior ministries of German federal states, the Chinese embassy
requested that communities be asked not to hoist Tibetan flags on Tibet Day
(March 10). In some cases, ministries complied, but in the majority of cases they
did not. Almost none of the communities complied. The Chinese embassy in Berlin

As aresult, we stay underweight US equities and have moved risk from our
US credit longs into Europe. Our initial US equity underweight was against
Europe and EM Asia. Our recent downgrade of Q1 growth in the Euro area
and better activity data in China made us move the lion’s share of the
overweight versus the US into EM Asia (see Wednesday’s Global Market
Outlook and Strategy).

Chinese activity data continue to surprise on the upside. October data for
IP, retail sales and fixed investment each came above our expectations. This
creates upside risk, but no change yet, to our forecasts which already assume a
gentle rise in quarterly growth rates from under 7% early this year to just
above 8% in Q1. Better data reduce the need for renewed fiscal and monetary
stimulus. The 18th Party Congress started yesterday, will last a week, and will
be followed by the announcement of the next leadership. More important for
the economic outlook will be the Annual Central Economic Working
Conference that will be held in December. We expect it to support continued
moderate fiscal policy, a neutral monetary policy, and further economic
rebalancing towards domestic consumption. It may also lower the 2013
growth target to 7%. For more details, see Haibin Zhu in today’s GDW.

Fixed Income

Bonds rallied strongly, in the slipstream of the tumbling equity market.
President Obama’s re-election perhaps also diminishes expectations of a
change in course at the Fed.

The ECB and the Bank of England stood pat at their policy meetings this
week, but the latter delivered a curveball today, announcing that its net
coupon income from QE would be transferred to the UK Treasury from next
year on. The near-term effect is a slight monetary easing, as the money will
be used to reduce the amount of gilts in issue, similar to QE itself.

Beyond that, this is another small step towards perceptions that monetary
policy is no longer independent from fiscal policy, like the Bank of Japan’s
joint statement with two government ministers last month. Nobody knows the
tipping point at which these perceptions feed into much higher inflation
expectations, just that we'll know it when we see it.

Core euro bond yields are towards the low end of the range, and we expect
them to head higher. But we focus more risk on spread compression trades,
via overweights in Euro area peripherals, US MBS, and EM local bonds vs
DM.

Equities

Equity markets fell sharply post US elections, but we are not changing our
strategy.

From a month ago, we avoided directional longs in our GMOS model equity
portfolio due to elevated positions by spec investors (see Charts A10 and A12
in today’s Flows & Liquidity). We preferred to focus instead on regional and
sectoral trades. We stay with the same strategy focusing our
recommendations on EM Asia across regions, and Cyclical stocks and US
Home builders across sectors.

The rebound in the October global manufacturing PMI is what keeps us long
Cyclical vs. Defensive equity sectors. Is this a high-beta trade? Not

Teaching Kids to Walk and Talk

Failure is instructive. The person who really thinks learns quite
as much from his failures as from his successes.
—John Dewey

Teaching is a serious issue. Teachers matter. Or at least they should mat-
ter. But we have the sense that it is the job of the teacher to tell us stuff.
Students expect it and teachers do it. Often, teachers get criticized if
they do anything else. And, this is pretty much the beginning and the
end of the problem with teaching. We force teachers to teach wrong.

Iam beyond the age where I have little kids that I have to teach
how to walk and talk. But when I did, I don’t remember preparing
any lesson plans. In a cognitive process-based model of education, all
teaching looks like the teaching you do when you teach your children
to walk and talk.

Lately I have been personally interested in being taught. This is
because at the age of 55 I started to play softball in an old guys’ softball
league in Florida. I discovered I wasn’t really very good. This was a bit
surprising since I had played in the university softball leagues while I
was a professor and had stopped playing only in my 40s. I wasn’t a bad
player then. There hadn’t been that long a hiatus. And, I was playing
against people a good deal older than myself since I am rather young
as recent Florida transplants go. I used to be a good hitter and I wasn’t
now. The reason was easy enough to understand. In the university
leagues they play fast pitch. A batter has a second or so to decide about
swinging. It is all instinct. At least it was after having played for 40
some odd years.

But, in Florida, old guys play slow pitch. The pitcher throws the
ball in a high looping arc and it is a strike if it lands on the plate. Quite
a different experience from trying to hit a ball that is zinging by your
head. Should be easier, no? Not for me. It took a bit of thinking to
figure out why.

dogs are not in the area. He said he was bitten by Duke a couple of years ago. He
was talking with Dr. Lynn and the dog just reached out and bit him, tearing his
pants and breaking the skin. He said he has been friends with Dr. Lynn and
Marerit for many years but it was just unsafe for anybody and any animals in the
area.

Bobby Goodnough said he was jogging in the area and the dog lunged at him,
causing him to have to dive through a 12 foot hedge to get away from it. He said
he just thought it was a matter of time before the dog got a person or a child. Sgt.
Krauel asked if Mr. Goodnough had reported the incident to the police department
or had a time frame of occurrence. Mr. Goodnough said he had not made a police
report but it occurred about 2 years ago.

Laura Klein, 130 Seaspray Ave., said she had lived here for 12 years, having
moved from Washington, D.C. for a sense of security. She said she was now in
the process of installing surveillance cameras. She said she could no longer walk
her dog without constantly looking around, worrying if Duke had once again
escaped from the open gates. She said it is a privilege to own a dog and dog
ownership and responsibility should go hand in hand. She said Dr. Lynn was
issued a citation in August of 2002 for locking his dog in a car with the windows
rolled up. She said she mentioned this to prove his irresponsibility. She said his
voluminous file from Animal Care and Control would attest to this. She said no
one was safe while Duke is in Palm Beach.

James Merola was present on behalf of Dr. Lynn and said he was present on a
revised Notice of Code Violation and Hearing dated July 15, 2008. He said he
was not denying there were incidents with Duke. Palm Beach County had the dog
taken into custody and the hearing was held June 5, 2008. At that hearing, it was
agreed upon by the County and Dr. Lynn that the dog would be classified as
dangerous. The dog was classified as dangerous which required certain
restrictions on the dog which Dr. Lynn complied with and the dog was returned to
him. In the event Duke has another incident, pursuant to state and county law, but
some reason not Town law, the dog would be taken into custody and euthanized.
Mr. Merola said Dr. Lynn feels very badly about the situation and agreed with the
County to do what they required. Mr. Merola said Dr. Lynn then received a
letter, dated June 16, 2008 from the police department, mentioning the order of
the County and stating for the first time that the Town was declaring the dog
dangerous and giving him ten (10) days to appeal, which he did not. On June 20,
2008, 4 days after the dog was declared dangerous by the Town, the police
department sent a second letter, citing 10-45 (i), advising that since the dog
already had two incidents, they wanted it removed or euthanized. The dog had not
done anything since being declared dangerous. This letter did not mention an
appeal, but he sent a letter anyway, stating they did not agree with that. He said
the dog was declared dangerous on June 16, requirements were imposed and they
complied with those, including the filing of a $1000 bond and they did not agree
the dog should now be removed. There was a Town Council hearing on August
8 and the Council said they needed to have the dog removed or euthanized. Mr.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013255.txt,"Glossary of Specialized Terms 339

Procedure Evaluation/Execution: A general term encompassing both Schema Execu-
tion and Predicate Evaluation, both of which are similar computational processes involving
manipulation of Combo trees associated with ProcedureNodes.

Procedure Learning: Learning of procedural knowledge, based on any method, e.g. evo-
lutionary learning (e.g. MOSES), inference (e.g. PLN), reinforcement learning (e.g. Hebbian
learning).

e Procedure Node: A SchemaNode or PredicateNode

e Psi: A model of motivated action and emotion, originated by Dietrich Dorner and further
developed by Joscha Bach, who incorporated it in his proto-AGI system MicroPsi. OpenCog-
Prime’s motivated-action component, OpenPsi, is roughly based on the Psi model.
Psynese: A system enabling different OpenCog instances to communicate without using
natural language, via directly exchanging Atom subgraphs, using a special system to map
references in the speaker’s mind into matching references in the listener’s mind.

Psynet Model: An early version of the theory of mind underlying CogPrime, referred to
in some early writings on the Webmind AI Engine and Novamente Cognition Engine. The
concepts underlying the psynet model are still part of the theory underlying CogPrime, but
the name has been deprecated as it never really caught on.

e Reasoning: See inference

e Reduct: A code library, used within MOSES, applying a collection of hand-coded rewrite
rules that transform Combo programs into Elegant Normal Form.

Region Connection Calculus: A mathematical formalism describing a system of basic
operations among spatial regions. Used in CogPrime as part of spatial inference to provide
relations and rules to be referenced via PLN and potentially other subsystems.
Reinforcement Learning: Learning procedures via experience, in a manner explicitly
guided to cause the learning of procedures that will maximize the system’s expected future
reward. CogPrime does this implicitly whenever it tries to learn procedures that will maxi-
mize some Goal whose Truth Value is estimated via an expected reward calculation (where
*reward” may mean simply the Truth Value of some Atom defined as ”reward”). Goal-driven
learning is more general than reinforcement learning as thus defined; and the learning that
CogPrime does, which is only partially goal-driven, is yet more general.

RelEx: A software system used in OpenCog as part of natural language comprehension, to
map the output of the link parser into more abstract semantic relationships. These more
abstract relationships may then be entered directly into the Atomspace, or they may be
further abstracted before being entered into the Atomspace, e.g. by RelEx2Frame rules.
RelEx2Frame: A system of rules for translating RelEx output into Atoms, based on the
FrameNet ontology. The output of the RelEx2Frame rules make use of the FrameNet library
of semantic relationships. The current (2012) RelEx2Frame rule-based is problematic and
the RelEx2Frame system is deprecated as a result, in favor of Link2Atom. However, the
ideas embodied in these rules may be useful; if cleaned up the rules might profitably be
ported into the Atomspace as ImplicationLinks.

Representation Building: A stage within MOSES, wherein a candidate Combo program
tree (within a deme) is modified by replacing one or more tree nodes with alternative tree
nodes, thus obtaining a new, different candidate program within that deme. This process
currently relies on hand-coded knowledge regarding which types of tree nodes a given tree
node should be experimentally replaced with (e.g. an AND node might sensibly be replaced
with an OR node, but not so sensibly replaced with a node representing a kick” action).

unreasonable guess, since both of us were grinning throughout. Others concluded
that because each of us was trying to nudge the other to go in first, it was a sign of
underlying conflict: neither of us wanted to allow the other the privilege of
appearing to be polite. Still others, bizarrely, said that it was an ornate Middle
Eastern power play, with the aim of demonstrating that / was ultimately in control
of proceedings. In fact, it would turn out to be a singularly apt image of what
happened in the days that followed: a reluctant Arafat, an engaged and expectant
Prime Minister of Israel, a smiling and hopeful Clinton.

We did begin on a note of optimism. In my opening statement, I said: ““Now is
the time for us to make a peace of the brave, to find a way to live together side by
side with mutual respect, and to create a better future for our children.” Arafat said
he hoped that the peace Begin and Sadat had made at Camp David would prove an
auspicious example. “With the help of President Clinton, we could reach a deal
that is good for both sides.”

But it was going to take more than noble words. The details of a peace treaty, or
even a framework agreement, were going to require negotiation. Both Arafat and I
arrived fully aware of the shape of the “hard decisions” I’d referred to months
earlier when we met in Oslo. On his side, it would come down to whether he was
prepared for a comprehensive, final peace. A true “end of conflict,” with no get-out
clauses, no strings left untied, no further claims on either side. In concrete terms,
this would mean abandoning his claim for a notional hundreds of thousands of
Palestinian refugees to resettle inside the pre-1967 borders of the State of Israel.
And what were Israel’s difficult decisions? In return for the end of conflict, I
would have to deal away the maximum possible part of the West Bank, certainly

met with President Clinton. I would have to accept the idea of land swaps, if
necessary, in order to bring the overall percentage as near as possible to the
equivalent of the whole of the West Bank. I would have to be flexible on the
arrangements to ensure Israeli security oversight over the Jordan Valley. And if a

The staff delegation trips to China were welcomed and sought after by congressional staff
and congressional support agency personnel, mainly from the Congressional Research
Service of the Library of Congress, which had a growing interest in China and the issues

it posed for US policy. The trips generally came twice per year and involved meetings with
Chinese government officials and others responsible for key foreign affairs and domestic
issues of interest to the Congress. The exchanges in these meetings were generally cordial
and substantive, although the trips also included sightseeing and visits to parts of China of
interest to the Congress.

In the United States, there have been a number of counterpart groups that have facilitated
congressional exchanges. Among them are the Washington, DC-based US-Asia Institute
(USAT), which has played a leading role in managing the congressional staff delegations
side since 1985.* The National Committee on US-China Relations did a pilot congressional
staff delegation visit to China in 1976 and resumed involvement with such exchanges
again during the past decade.* In the 1980s, the Asia-Pacific Exchange Foundation (also
known as the Far East Studies Institute) also managed a number of congressional staff
delegations to China, while the US-Asia Institute has, since 1985, coordinated over

120 such delegations and exchanges to China. These visits have been done in cooperation
with the Chinese People’s Institute of Foreign Affairs (CPIFA) and the Better Hong Kong
Foundation (BHKF). But the National People’s Congress (NPC) has perhaps hosted the
most trips, taking over a thousand congressional staff members to China. In these trips,
members have traveled to nearly every corner of China, including Xinjiang and Tibet. In
their discussions, they have covered a wide range of themes important to the US-China
relationship. Staffers participating in such trips have clearly advanced their understanding
of Chinese developments.

Congress and Turmoil in US-China Relations, 1989-2001

The number of the congressional staff delegations to China slowed following the collapse
of congressional support for engagement with China after the Tiananmen crackdown in
1989. Congressional anger and the impulse to punish the Chinese government overrode
past interest in constructive engagement. As a result, Beijing began relying more heavily on
the US business community and its organizations, notably the Emergency Committee for
American Trade, to persuade Congress not to end the most-favored nation tariff treatment
for Chinese imports. The Chinese embassy and various lobbyists who were, or at least
claimed to be, supported by the Chinese government also tried to limit the damage by
seeking to convince congressional members that conditions in China were much better
there than were depicted in American media at the time.°

Based on the reputation of its past efforts, the US-Asia Institute, presumably with
the encouragement of its Chinese counterparts, strove to resume the staff dialogues
and attracted a wide range of senior staff and support personnel, including some of

would have started a small-scale war, not to mention run the very real risk of
not getting out alive.

In fact, we left the missile boat, Manno’s offshore command post, in motor
dinghies out of earshot of Beirut and cut the engines as we got closer to the
shore. All of us, including the “women”, were wrapped in ponchos to avoid
showing up on Rue Verdun soaking wet. After getting out of the dinghies, we
were carried ashore by the SEALs to make sure we stayed dry. All of us had
loose-fitting jackets. The attack teams used them to conceal Uzis, explosive
charges to blow the locks on the apartment doors if they couldn’t be forced
open, a hand grenade or two and flashlights for the dash up the stairs. One
member of each team had a large plastic bag, with orders to take away any
easily accessible documents for Mossad analysts back home. As the mother of
the brood, I also had a large purse, in which I carried our radio to communicate
with the team leaders and with Manno on the missile boat if necessary.

Our SEAL pilots steered us well away from the more built-up part of the
seafront towards the Coral Beach, one of the private clubs on the southern end
of the shoreline. Four rented station wagons were waiting, two of them for us
and two for Amnon’s squad. Amnon set off toward the DFLP target. We headed
north towards the center of town. In the Spielberg film, my speaking role
consisted of two words, my name, as I introduced myself to my driver. In fact,
we had already met: during the run-through exercises in Tel Aviv. After we got
into the cars, I asked him how his scouting of the route had gone. He said
basically OK, but that he’d noticed a couple of cops patrolling near the top of
Verdun on one of his drive-bys. I assured him it would be fine. There would be
no reason for a policeman to suspect what we were up to, or who we were. Still,
I could tell he was nervous. “What’s wrong?” I asked. He hesitated before
replying. “I’ve never been in a place where there’s live fire,” he said. I told him
not to worry. He sti// wouldn’t be. “You’re going to be parked around the
comer, until it’s over. Then, it’s just about getting home.”

When we reached the top of Verdun, it was about ten minutes after one in
the morning. Our cars pulled over. I took Mookie’s arm as we began walking
the 150 feet or so to the first of the apartment buildings. The others followed in
knots of two or three. Both Mookie and I saw a policeman approaching on the
sidewalk. “Ignore him,” I whispered. We weaved a few inches to the side to let
him pass. The buildings were as we’d expected, with their lobbies set back from
a covered terrace in front. As the other teams made their way to the second

Subject: Edge Question 2011 - An Invitation 
Importance: High 
Deliciously creative.., the variety astonishes...intellectual skyrockets of stunning brilliance. Nobody 
in the world is doing what Edge is doing. Denis Dutton, ARTS & LETTERS DAILY 
THE WORLD QUESTION CENTER 
James Flynn has defined shorthand abstractions (or sHA's) as concepts drawn from science that have 
become part of the language and make people smarter by providing widely applicable templates (market, 
placebo, random sample, naturalistic fallacy, are a few of his examples). His idea is that the 
abstraction is available as a single cognitive chunk which can be used as an element in thinking and 
debate. 
The Edge Question 2011 
WHAT SCIENTIFIC CONCEPT WOULD IMPROVE EVERYBODY'S COGNITIVE TOOLKIT? 
The term 'scientificis to be understood in a broad sense as the most reliable way of gaining knowledge 
about anything, whether it be the human spirit, the role of great people in history, or the structure of 
DNA. A scientific concept may come from philosophy, logic, economics, jurisprudence, or other analytic 
enterprises, as long as it is a rigorous conceptual tool that may be summed up succinctly (or in a 
phrase) but has broad application to understanding the world. 
[Thanks to Steven Pinker for suggesting this year's EDGE Question and to Daniel Kahneman for advice on 
its presentation.]

contributions to me. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029901 
As usual, no politics (Democrat Republican) or politicians (Obama Bush Clinton Pali n', etc.), 
editorials, opeds, opinion pieces, flippancy. No ad hominem comments. No self-promotion: referencing your 
books, papers, courses, selling from the stage, pushing your well-known agenda. No footnotes or 
hyperlink: stay on the page. No anecdotes about spouses, significant others, kids, family pets. Write a 
stand-alone piece: don't respond to the pieces of other contributors already posted. 
Go deeper than the news. Tell me something I don't know. This is not a purely scientific question: this 
is question about our culture and ourselves. The ideas we present on Edge can offer readers and the wider 
public a new set of metaphors to describe ourselves, our minds, the way we think, the world, and all of 
the things we know in it. 
Be imaginative, exciting, compelling, inspiring. Tell a great story. Make an argument that makes a 
difference. Amaze and delight. Surprise us! 
I look forward to hearing from you. Happy New Year! 
Sincerely,

Mr. Fried advised Mr. Maxey that the Code Enforcement Board’s position was to
enforce the Code and said that he had always found the Town Council members to
be very receptive, individually and as a group. Mr. Fried said it was not beyond
the Town Council’s power and authority, if persuaded, to look into an ordinance
and suggested Mr. Maxey address it with them.

B. Case # 08-2508, 227 Brazilian Ave., 2F, Hillen J. Smith
Violation of Chapter 18, Section 18-241 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of
Ordinances, building permits required to construct, install, repair or alter any
building or building system

Lead Code Enforcement Officer said Mr. Smith was found in violation, assessed
$150.00 in administrative costs and given until July 16, 2008 to come into
compliance. Compliance has not been achieved so this is the time a fine would be
assessed. Mr. Walton said the contractor was present to speak.

Steve Pappanelli said he was hired by Mr. Smith after Mr. Smith had been cited
and he was 90% complete with the job. He was just waiting on his final
inspections and he should have it by next week but the building is closed to all
construction inspections for two (2) weeks. Mr. Pappanelli said he was present on
Mr. Smith’s behalf to request a three (3) week extension. Mr. Walton said the
Town did not oppose the extension of time. Mr. Walton said the three weeks was
necessary because the building would not let inspections be done while their
maintenance man was on vacation. Mr. Walton said if compliance was not
achieved by August 7, 2008 then he would ask for a $250.00 a day fine to
commence on August 8, 2008.

Ms. Greenberg asked some questions about the type of permits and remarked that
it is unfortunate in multi-family dwellings that this type of situation would exist to
begin with because electrical and plumbing can have catastrophic effects on other
owners. She said it is unfortunate the people do not do the right thing until they
get caught. Mr. Pappanelli said he was not the contractor working without
permits.

MOTION BY MR. OCHSTEIN TO GRANT AN EXTENSION OF TIME
UNTIL AUGUST 8, 2008 TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE AND TO ASSESS
A FINE OF $250.00, RETROACTIVE TO JULY 17, 2008 IF COMPLIANCE
WAS NOT ACHIEVED

SECONDED BY MS. GREENBERG

During discussion on the motion, Ms. Duemler stated she believed the retroactive
fine was a little harsh. Mr. Ballentine said he agreed and asked what the reason for
the retroactive fine was. Mr. Ochstein said there are so many people who do work

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023952.txt,"206 Teaching Minds

A good place to start is to ask what a highly functioning adult can
do and moreover has to be able to do in order to live in this world.
When we ask this question, the phrase “21st-century skills” will not
come up. Every time that phrase comes up, somehow the answer
turns out to include algebra and calculus and science, which, the last
I heard, were 19th-century skills too.

In fact, let’s not talk about particular centuries at all. To see why,
I want to diverge for a moment into a discussion of the maritime in-
dustry, a subject with which I have become more fascinated over the
years. What did a mariner from Ancient Greece have in common with
his modern counterpart in terms of abilities?

The answer is an obsession with weather, ship maintenance, lead-
ership and organization, navigation, planning, goal prioritization,
and handling of emergencies.

Effective mariners from ancient times would have in common
with those of today is an understanding of how to operate their ships,
the basic laws of weather, tides, navigation, and other relevant issues
in the physical world, and an ability to make decisions well when
circumstances are difficult. They also would have to know how to get
along with fellow workers, how to manage the people who report to
them, as well as basic laws of commerce and defense.

In fact, the worlds they inhabit, from an educational point of view,
that is, from thinking about what to teach and how to teach it, would
be nearly identical except for one thing: how to operate and maintain
the equipment. Their ships were, of course, quite different.

So, let’s reformulate this question that seems to haunt every mod-
ern-day pundit on education (usually politicians or newspaper people).
What are 21st-century skills? Can this question be transformed (for
mariners) into what does a 21st-century mariner need to be educated
about that his Ancient Greek counterpart was not educated about?

The answer, it seems obvious to me, is 21st-century equipment
and procedures: engines, navigation devices, particular political situa-
tions, computers, and so on. But, and this is an important “but,” none
of this stuff is the real issue in the education of a mariner. The real
issue is decision making. What one has to make a decision about is
secondary to the issue of knowing how to make a decision at all.

You can learn about a piece of equipment or a procedure by ap-
prenticeship. Start as a helper and move on gradually to being an ex-
pert. But this is not what school emphasizes. School typically attempts
to intellectualize these subjects. Experts write books about the theory

prisons. First, the Department of Corrections prohibited inmates from
receiving nonprofits. PLA/sued and won. Next, the state issued a rule that
inmates couldn’ t receive publications that were paid out of their trust
accounts. PLN managed to get that rule overturned too. Then the prisons
adopted a policy of not delivering subscription-renewal notices. PLN took
that to court and succeeded in getting the policy reversed. PLN has won
similar lawsuits or settlements in Alabama, California, Michigan, Nevada

While serving five years in a California prison for growing medical
marijuana, Todd McCormick contributed a couple of stories--about his
experiences with psilocybin and ketamine--to my anthology, Magic
Mushrooms and Other Highs: From Toad Slime to Ecstasy, and when it was
published, | immediately sent him a copy. But the warden rejected it

“because on pages 259-261, it describes the process of squeezing toads
to obtain illicit substances which could be detrimental to the security,
good order and discipline of the institution.”

This was pure theater of cruelty. Federal correctional facilities do
not have a toad problem, and outside accomplices have not been

beyond, the rights created by statute and that it adopted the statutory language whenever possible. 45° Yet under the
Advisory Committee's proposed changes, victims' speedy trial rights under the CVRA are not incorporated into the Rules.

Victims should have their rights regarding scheduling reflected in the rule dealing with scheduling issues. My proposed rule
closely tracks the language of [*948] the CVRA. *°° It does add a provision that victims would be heard on a motion to
continue a proceeding. 4° This provision is consistent with the definitive legislative history. As Senator Kyl explained: This
provision [in the CVRA] should be interpreted so that any decision to schedule, reschedule, or continue criminal cases should
include victim input through the victim's assertion of the right to be free from unreasonable delay. 4°! My proposed rule also
requires that the court state its reason for granting any continuance. This requirement stems from a recommendation from the
President's Task Force on Victims of Crime. The Task Force noted the inherent human tendency to postpone matters, often for
insufficient reason, and accordingly recommended that reasons for any granted continuance ... be clearly stated on the

record. +? Several states have adopted similar provisions. 47

Rule 53 - Closed-Circuit Transmission of Proceedings for Victims The Proposals:
I proposed that closed-circuit transmission of court proceedings for victims should be authorized as follows:
Rule 53. Courtroom Photographing and Broadcasting Prohibited

(a) General Rule. Except as otherwise provided by a statute or these rules, the court must not permit the taking of photographs
in the courtroom during judicial proceedings or the broadcasting of judicial proceedings from the courtroom.

(b) Closed-Circuit Transmission for Victims. In order to permit victims of crime to watch criminal trial proceedings, the court

may authorize closed-circuit televising of the proceedings for viewing by victims or other persons the court determines have a

compelling interest in doing so. 494

The Advisory Committee proposed no change to this rule. 49°
[*949] Discussion:

I proposed to facilitate a victim's protected right to attend a trial by allowing closed-circuit broadcasting of a trial. The Advisory
Committee did not act on this proposal for reasons that are unclear, as it did not include this proposed change in the catalog of
my proposals that it was rejecting. 4°°

Perhaps the Advisory Committee felt that it had sufficiently addressed the subject in its proposed changes to Rule 60. There the
Committee simply tracked language in the CVRA and provided that if the court finds that the number of victims makes it
impracticable to accord all of the victims the rights described in subsection (a), the court must fashion a reasonable procedure

tacts with Russia while still in Hong Kong. When Lana Lam asked
Snowden on June 12, 2013, whether he had already requested asy-
lum from the Russian government, he deferred, saying, “My only
comment is that I am glad there are governments that refuse to be
intimidated by great power.” The Russian government was clearly
not intimidated by the threats of reprisals by the United States, as
the Obama administration would learn after Snowden’s arrival in
Russia on June 23. Snowden could only have known that with cer-
tainty on June 12 if he had been in contact with Russian officials
prior to his interview with Lam.

If Putin’s own description of Snowden’s interactions with the
Russians in Hong Kong is to be believed, the decision to facilitate
Snowden’s escape to Russia had been kicked all the way up the Rus-
sian chain of command to Putin. Presumably, this decision-making
process began earlier than June 21, when Snowden was said to have
gone to the consulate. But how much earlier? Because Snowden had
arrived in Hong Kong on May 20, his contacts with Russian offi-
cials could have occurred in May. Such a contact with the Russians

© would fit with Snowden’s telling Gellman on May 24 that he needed ®
his help in dealing with the diplomatic mission of a country that
Snowden did not identify.

In any case, Putin said an American “agent of the special services”
had contacted Russian diplomats because he wanted assistance. The
agent, Snowden, of course, needed assistance to escape from Hong
Kong. The decision to accept him in Russia, given the international
ramifications, would have to be made at a much higher level than the
Russian mission in Hong Kong.

Nine days before Snowden boarded Aeroflot Flight SU213 to
Moscow on June 23, the United States had filed a criminal complaint
against him. It had also officially alerted Interpol when it unsealed
the complaint on June 21. It had invalidated his U.S. passport except
to return to America (although he still had it in his possession at
the Hong Kong airport). Because by this time he was the most
famous visitor in Hong Kong, his passage through passport control
on June 23 might have reflected the acquiescence of the Hong Kong
authorities to the reported request of China to be rid of Snowden by
that date.

CHAPTER TWENTY

The NSA’s Back Door

“You have private for-profit companies doing inherently governmental work like targeted espionage, surveillance,
compromising foreign systems. And there’s very little oversight, there’s very little review.”

- Edward Snowden, explaining his access to the NSA in Moscow, 2014

Prior to Snowden’s theft of NSA documents, the single most shattering blow to the confidence
of the US intelligence community was the exposure of Aldrich Ames as a long-serving Russian
mole in the CIA in 1994. Ames, it will be recalled, had been a high-ranking CIA officer. He had
even worked at the CIA’s Counterintelligence Center Analysis Group before he was arrested by
the FBI. He had also worked as a mole for Russian intelligence. (His recruitment by the KGB will
be further discussed in Chapter twenty-seven.)

In a plea bargain to avoid the death sentence, he admitted that he had successfully burrowed
into the CIA for over nine years on behalf of the KGB. His description of his sub rosa activities as
a mole was part of the plea bargain. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. This stunning
revelation shook the CIA leadership to its core. Up until then, as mentioned earlier, CIA
executives steadfastly denied that it was possible that the KGB could sustain a mole in American
intelligence. The Ames arrest also led the NSA to reassess its own vulnerability to penetration.
Could there be an Ames inside the NSA?

The question was considered by the NSA’s National Threats Operations Center, the same unit
from which Edward Snowden later stole a huge trove of secret documents. According to a report
in 1996 entitled “Out of Control” (later released by the NSA), the danger of an Ames-type
penetration could not be excluded. Even though the “threat officer” who wrote this report was
not identified by name, his analysis proved incredibly prescient. He said that the NSA’s drive to
enhance its performance by networking its computers would result in the intelligence services,
putting “all their classified information ‘eggs’ into one very precarious basket.” The basket was
the computer networks run by technicians called: system administrators.” He pointed out that the
NSA was becoming increasingly dependent on such networked computer systems, and he
predicted that the NSA’s “Aldrich Ames.” As he put it, would be a “system
administrator’ —which was the position that Edward Snowden held nearly two decades later at
Dell when he began stealing secrets.

truthful in describing himself. He said that he had been a senior
adviser to the CIA, when he had been just a telecommunications sup-
port officer. He also said he had been a senior adviser at the Defense
Intelligence Agency, even though, according to that intelligence
service, he was never employed there. (He did speak at an inter-
agency counterintelligence course the DIA had sponsored.) He said
he had a $200,000-a-year salary from Booz Allen when, according
to Booz Allen, it was $133,000. It is understandable that he wanted
to impress these Guardian journalists in light of his young age and
boyish appearance, even to the extent of meretriciously claiming
in the video that he had been personally given the “authority” at
the NSA to intercept President Obama’s private communications,
which, according to an NSA spokeswoman, was not true. No NSA
employee, and certainly no civilian contract worker, was given the
authority to spy on the president of the United States, she insisted.
Such career enhancements reinforced the fact that Snowden altered
reality when it suited his purpose with journalists.

Snowden had greatly exaggerated or misrepresented the posi-

© tions he held with the CIA and the DIA, but no effort was made by ©
the team of journalists to verify the information. Instead, MacAskill
wrote to Janine Gibson in New York, “The Guinness is good.” It was
a prearranged code by which MacAskill certified Snowden’s cred-
ibility for The Guardian. Gibson told Greenwald to proceed with the
story. Snowden had already provided Poitras and Greenwald with
thumb drives on which he had loaded the documents he wanted
them to use.

Greenwald wrote his first story about NSA transgressions based
almost entirely on the FISA warrant involving Verizon’s coopera-
tion that Snowden had copied from the administrative file. Before
the story could be published, however, the Guardian policy required
relevant American government officials be given the opportunity to
respond. Gibson made the requisite call to the White House national
security spokesperson, Caitlin Hayden, who arranged a conference
call with the FBI’s deputy director, Sean Joyce, the NSA’s deputy
director, Chris Inglis, and Robert Litt, the legal officer for the Office of
the Director of National Intelligence. After duly taking into account

waiting to be activated for such a job, sleeper agents were instructed to build every detail of their
cover identity so as to perfectly blend in with Americans.

To build this American network of sleeper agents took the better part of a decade. In 2005,
this SVR’s “American” section in Moscow had begun methodically installing “sleeper agents” in
the US. Almost all of them were all Russian citizens who had assumed new identities to better
blend into their communities.

The CIA learned of this sleeper program through Poteyev soon after it began. The issue was
how to exploit this knowledge. When I was writing my book on international deception, Angleton
had pointed out to me that “the business of intelligence services is understanding precisely the
relationship of their opposition to them.” His view, though his opponents inside the CIA would
call it with some justification an obsession, was that an intelligence service had focus on the
moves of its rivals. To accomplish this “business” in the first decade of the 21“ century, the CIA
had to establish why its new opposition, the SVR, was laying the foundation for an espionage
operation. What were its priorities in the resumption of the intelligence war? Its inside man,
Poteyev, in the SVR, provided it with a tremendous advantage in this relationship. It knew the
links in a sleeper network that the SVR believed was safely hidden from surveillance. If they were
followed, when they were activated they could expose whatever recruits the SVR had in the
American government. The CIA duly shared this information about the sleeper ring with the FBI,
which had the responsibility for the surveillance of foreign agents in the United States, The FBI,
for its part, kept the Russian sleeper agents under tight surveillance—an operation which grew in
complexity and expense as more SVR agents arrived in the US.

Meanwhile, in Moscow, Poteyev was following the unfolding operation. Part of his SVR job
was to continue preparing these “Americans,” as they were called by the SVR, for their
assignments. Some had been sent as couples, other as singletons. One of the singletons that
Poteyev personally handled was Anna Kushchyenko. She was a strikingly beautiful Russian
student, who changed her name to Anna Chapman by briefly marrying a British citizen she met at
arave party. After taking his name, she left him. After completing her training in Russia, the
SVR sent her to New York City to establish herself as international real estate specialist. Other
“Americans” under Poteyev’s watch became travel agents, students, and financial advisers. In all,
Poteyev identified to the CIA twelve such sleeper agents. Since they had been instructed to
simply act out their role, while awaiting an intelligence assignment, they presented no real threat.
Even so, the cost of FBI surveillance over the years became sizable. Around the clock
surveillance on the movements and communications of a single individual can cost, according to a
former FBI agent, over $10,000 a day.

The situation suddenly changed when the CIA received Poteyev’s message in 2010. It warned
that Russian military intelligence had asked the SVR to activate some of its sleeper agents for a
highly-sensitive assignment. Such a move suggested that Russian intelligence had found a
possible source that could supply it with valuable information. According to a former CIA

Figure 4: Mean and Standard Deviation of Age-specific Fertility
Based on the following sets of fertility data: 1906 Taiwan [11], Standard Natural Fertility [4], 1973 Libya
and 19th century Utah [6].

3 Uncertainty about recipients

Thus far, I have assumed that the recipient is known with certainty at the time the investment
is made. No allowance has yet been made for the possibility that the benefit may eventually go
to someone other than the intended recipient. As in my previous paper on time preference, I
will incorporate uncertainty by assuming that when the benefit arrives, it will be allocated among
potential recipients (including the donor herself) so as to maximize its discounted value to the
donor. As before, I rule out the possibility of distributing the benefit among several recipients.
The development below differs from that of my previous paper in two ways. First, it allows the
interaction to affect fertility as well as survival. Second, it will incorporate diminishing marginal
returns to consumption.

3.1 Model

We begin as before, with table 1. The difference is that, under uncertainty it is not the row-sum
itself that must equal zero, but the expected value of this sum. I assume changes in fertility and
survival are caused by changes in consumption, as discussed above in section 2.2.2. In addition, I
use the model of diminishing marginal returns defined above in section 2.3. Thus, equations 6-7
and 11-12 allow equation 5 to be re-expressed as

0= An (am + BPYY) [KO
+ Ane? Bf (am) + BPA) /n (14)

where £ denotes the expectation. In taking this expectation, I define v@) = 0 when there is no
recipient at all.

Message from
the Director
I
am pleased to present the fourth annual report from the Office of
Government Information Services (OGIS) detailing our fiscal year (FY)
2013 activities. We are extremely proud of all that OGIS has accomplished
in our four years of operation. We have put Congress’s novel idea—
applying Alternative Dispute Resolution techniques to an often highly
adversarial process—into action. We have assisted thousands of Freedom
of Information Act (FOIA) requesters from across the country and around
the globe, along with dozens of agencies, in resolving disputes, some of
which would have otherwise led to costly litigation. We have worked with
agencies to better fulfill their responsibility to provide good customer
service, resolve disputes with FOIA requesters, and promote compliance
with FOIA.
Demand for OGIS’s services is high. Requests for assistance in resolving
FOIA disputes greeted me the morning the office opened four years ago. In
FY 2013, the number of incoming cases jumped 40 percent from the previous
year to more than 500 cases; at the same time, we closed nearly 500 cases—
also a 40-percent increase from the previous year—and handled hundreds of
inquiries by telephone and email.
Much work remains for our innovative program. While we have carried out
Congress’s mandate to review Federal agency FOIA policies, procedures, and
compliance in several ways, we would like to implement a more robust review
program. OGIS’s mission is broad, and like many government programs, we
2
must make difficult choices about how we carry out our mandate as demand
for our services increases.
We look forward to building on our first four years and continuing our
service of helping anyone—requester or agency—with any part of the FOIA
process and improving the administration of FOIA.
You may notice that this report is slimmer than our first three reports. Please
visit our blog, The FOIA Ombudsman: Information and Advice, where you’ll
find many of the items we included in past reports.
Sincerely,
Miriam Nisbet

Resolving
Disputes
OGIS’s mediation services to resolve Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA) disputes, as mandated by Congress, comprised the bulk
of OGIS’s work in FY 2013, as in the previous three years. Requests for
assistance awaited Director Nisbet when she opened the Office, and early
on, OGIS decided that demand for mediation services dictated that the
Office commit to assisting
anyone asking for help with
FOIA.
From the start, OGIS has
served as a confidential and
informal information resource,
communications
channel,
complaint handler, and dispute
resolver. OGIS strives to be an
advocate not for the requester or
the agency, but for an effective
FOIA process that works as
intended.
In its first three years, OGIS
handled an average of roughly
350 cases a year. The number
of requesters seeking OGIS
OGIS’s caseload soared above 500 for the
first time in FY 2013. (NARA Identifier
6443896)
4
assistance swelled in FY 2013, the Office’s fourth year. OGIS opened 508 cases, a
40-percent increase from FY 2012 when OGIS opened 361 cases. OGIS also handled
more than 230 inquiries—telephone calls and emails yielding quick responses that
did not require cases be opened—in FY 2013. OGIS closed 497 cases in FY 2013, a
40-percent increase from FY 2012 when the Office closed 354 cases.
OGIS cases involve issues that arise at various points in the FOIA process.
OGIS encourages requesters and agencies to communicate
through whatever means work best for them. (NARA Identifier
6479577)
In some cases, requesters attempt to learn
a request’s estimated date of completion as
required by FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(7)(B)
(ii), but are not able to obtain it from an
agency. In other cases, requesters disagree
with an agency’s application of FOIA
exemptions or an agency’s decision with
regard to FOIA fees. In all cases, there
is some issue that benefits from OGISfacilitated
communication between the
requester and the agency.
OGIS’s mediation services also include
providing Dispute Resolution Skills
training to agency FOIA professionals.
The goal of training is not to turn agency

several agencies and a Department of Labor–specific session in June 2013.

Measuring
Success
From OGIS’s start, the Office has faced enormous challenges in measuring
its success. While litigation typically results in judgment for one party
or the other, the success of mediation services depends on compromise by
the parties, whose participation is voluntary. Experience has taught us that
OGIS’s success may not rest in the outcome of mediation services, but in the
process of providing mediation services.
Mediation is a voluntary alternative dispute resolution process in which a
neutral third party, a mediator, assists disputing parties in reaching a mutually
agreeable resolution. Mediators do not direct outcomes or resolutions to
a dispute; the outcome of mediation depends on the extent to which the
parties choose to engage in the process and themselves agree to an outcome.
There may not necessarily be a “correct” answer; rather, the disputing parties
may choose to agree to a compromise that both parties can accept, or they
may choose to not compromise at all. As such, the outcome of mediation is
not an effective way to determine the success of OGIS’s mediation services
because OGIS does not determine the outcome. However, OGIS does control

the steps required to administer
mediation itself, and the Office’s
success in mediation services
can be more uniformly evaluated
in that regard. The challenge of
evaluating success of mediation
services is not unique to OGIS
or to the government—other
ombudsmen struggle with the
same issue.
The Government Accountability
Office (GAO), which conducted
an audit of OGIS in FY 2013,
recommended that OGIS establish
performance measures and
goals for its mediation services
that define the Office’s success
in handling mediation cases.
One challenge OGIS faces is measuring its success.
(NARA Identifier 6600378)
The GAO recommendation, coupled with OGIS’s experience providing
mediation services, will inform OGIS’s FY 2014 creation of performance
measures and goals for the work OGIS does. That multifaceted work

Agency Review
OGIS also is tasked with reviewing agencies’ FOIA operations and
compliance.
OGIS reviews agencies’ FOIA policies, procedures, and compliance in
various ways. Our review work includes
• Providing Dispute Resolution Skills training to agency FOIA professionals to help
them comply with the statutory requirement that FOIA Public Liaisons assist in
resolving disputes, 5 U.S.C. §§ 552(a)(6)(B)(ii) & 552(l)
• Highlighting Best Practices for agencies and requesters
• Reviewing and commenting on proposed agency FOIA regulations
• Reviewing FOIA websites and template letters
• Working with agencies when the Office observes policies or procedures that are
not consistent with FOIA law or policy, or that may differ from the practices
occurring at other agencies

In FY 2013, OGIS began looking at several specific issues regarding agency
policies, procedures, and compliance, including FOIA fees and fee waivers, and the
ways agencies process records related to immigration matters. OGIS also began
a “Preventing Litigation” project, working with agencies on ways to reduce their
chances of a request resulting in litigation.
GAO recommended that OGIS establish a time frame for completing and
implementing a methodology that defines, among other things, the scope,
schedule, criteria, and evaluation questions for reviewing Federal agencies’
FOIA policies, procedures, and compliance. OGIS had already begun creating
a draft assessment framework, which will form one piece of OGIS’s expanded
review methodology.
GAO’s recommendation mirrored that of the National Archives and
Records Administration’s Inspector General (IG), which conducted
a routine review of OGIS in FY 2012 to determine whether OGIS was
adequately established and meets Congress’s intent. The IG report,
completed in September 2012, found that OGIS meets the requirements set
forth in FOIA with regard to both review and dispute resolution. The IG
found that “additional resources could significantly improve OGIS’s ability
to address and meet its mission.”
In response to the GAO recommendations, NARA concurred with both
recommendations and will work to address them in FY 2014.

OGIS RECOMMENDATIONS
FOR IMPROVING FOIA
FOIA also directs OGIS to make recommendations to Congress and the
President to improve FOIA. In April 2012, OGIS released five recommendations
that the Office compiled in its first years. For example, OGIS encouraged agency
participation in FOIAonline, the Federal Government’s first multiagency FOIA
portal. As a founding partner in FOIAonline, OGIS continues to support the
portal’s improvement of services and expansion of partners.
In March 2013, OGIS issued four additional recommendations for
improving FOIA.
1. IMPLEMENTING DISPUTE
RESOLUTION FOR FOIA CONFLICTS
OGIS expanded its dispute resolution program to connect FOIA professionals,
legal counsel, and dispute resolution professionals to embed dispute resolution
firmly into an agency’s FOIA process. The goal is to identify issues that are
ripe for partnership and explore ways to work together to prevent and resolve
disputes as well as avoid litigation.
In 2013, OGIS identified several agencies, including OGIS’s parent agency,
NARA, to help to pilot a project designed to prevent and resolve disputes as
well as avoid litigation. OGIS has begun meeting with each of these agencies
to determine the types of FOIA disputes that result in litigation and to explore
ways to incorporate dispute resolution into their FOIA processes. (OGIS
also has worked with the Administrative Conference of the United States
to promote research into FOIA litigation to inform this process.) OGIS will
continue to pilot this project in FY 2014.
17
2. REITERATING THE IMPORTANCE OF FOIA
OGIS routinely encourages all Federal agencies to remind their staff
members of the importance of FOIA and that FOIA is everyone’s
responsibility. During Sunshine Week 2013, Archivist of the United
States, David Ferriero, sent such a message to NARA staff. Other agencies,
including the Departments of Energy and Transportation, sent similar
messages throughout the year. OGIS continues to encourage all agencies
to remind their staffs of the importance of FOIA and offers the Archivist’s
message as a model.
3. EXAMINATION OF FOIA FEES
OGIS continues to observe that fees and fee waivers remain a persistent point
of contention administratively and in litigation. OGIS began examining FOIA
fee issues by reviewing its own fee-related cases over the past four years and
identifying common themes. OGIS intends to continue this project in FY 2014
by working with stakeholders from both inside and outside government to
discuss fee issues.
4. IMMIGRATION RECORDS AND FOIA
Over the past four years, OGIS has observed a large increase in our cases related
to requests for immigration-related records from individuals who are not U.S.
citizens or lawful permanent residents. OGIS began communicating with agency
officials who receive these types of requests, as well as with some of the requester
organizations and representatives who file them. OGIS continues to work with
agencies to streamline the process and to identify issues related to first-party
immigration-related records requests that will inform OGIS stakeholders as well
as Congress and the President.
18
LOOKING AHEAD
In its fifth year, OGIS will continue to offer mediation services to
requesters and agencies; review agencies’ FOIA policies, procedures,
and compliance; and identify additional areas for improvement in the
FOIA process through recommendations to Congress and the President.
OGIS will also work to implement GAO’s recommendations of creating
performance measures and goals for its mediation services, as well as to
build on its review program.
SPECIAL THANKS
OGIS thanks the 113th Congress for its support of the FOIA Ombudsman’s
office: Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Senator Patrick Leahy and
Ranking Member Senator Chuck Grassley, and their personal and committee
staffs, particularly Lydia Griggsby; Representative Darrell Issa, chairman
of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Ranking
Member Representative Elijah Cummings, and Representative John Mica,
chairman of that committee’s Subcommittee on Government Operations,
and their personal and committee staffs, particularly Krista Boyd and Tegan
Millspaw; and Wendy Ginsberg of the Congressional Research Service.
We extend a special thanks to our colleagues at the National Archives,
including David S. Ferriero, Archivist of the United States; Jay Trainer,
Executive Head for Agency Services; and National Archives General Counsel
Gary M. Stern and Assistant General Counsel Jean Whyte for their support of
OGIS’s work.
We also thank Susan Ashtianie, Susan Cummings, and Mary Drak for their
guidance and help with the GAO report.

work hard to be famous superstars. They are in exactly the same game
as their Yale counterparts, so it follows that they don’t want to teach
either.

But the numbers are much bigger at Illinois. Classes are larger and
faculty have to teach more classes. So these same people, who would
readily move to an institution that didn’t treat them like this, are stuck
competing with their Yale colleagues and, at the same time, having so
many more undergraduates to deal with.

Guess who loses?

And, I haven’t even started to discuss the idea that most students
at Illinois do not go there to become professors or intellectuals, or
hobnob with the best and brightest. The faculty think they are (or
ought to be) at Yale, but the students do not. The students want to
get jobs 4 years later. Good luck with that. That is not what Yale is for.

I was told that explicitly one day, by the way. I had to give a short
talk to entering freshmen at Yale when I was the department chair.
The idea was to extol the virtues of majoring in the field represented
by the chair. Each chair gave a short speech. Mine, as usual, was the
shortest. Major in computer science—get a job. That was my speech.

I was booed.

I was booed by the freshmen, who by this time at Yale had been
there maybe 5 minutes but had already absorbed the zeitgeist of the
place. Yale was for thinkers not workers.

By the way, that was in 1982 or so. All our computer science gradu-
ates went to work at Microsoft in those years. There were lots of million-
aire alums not too long after. (Presumably, not those who were booing.)

They wouldn’t have booed at Illinois, and that is the point. Yale
is not the problem unless you realize that it sets the direction for ev-
ery other university in the country. It doesn’t do this by itself and it
doesn’t do it intentionally. Nevertheless, it ruins the chances that II-
linois graduates will receive a reasonably practical education that actu-
ally might get them jobs or teach them how to live in the real world.

So, we have created a system that values heavy intellectuals and
gives them a place to do their thing. Is this bad? How could it be bad?
It certainly isn’t bad for the intellectuals. But it is bad for the students.
Not necessarily for the students at Yale, although there are certainly
unhappy students there. It is bad for the society at large. Students
don’t need to major in subjects unless they intend to become profes-
sionals in those subjects. Actually, they need to intend to be profes-
sional researchers in those subjects, since the faculty really don’t know

approval, 3°7 but also court approval. 388 Any approval [*928] requires careful weighing of the competing concerns. The
Supreme Court has instructed that

the duty of the trial court ... [in considering whether to approve a jury trial waiver] is not to be discharged as a mere matter of
rote, but with sound and advised discretion, with an eye to avoid unreasonable or undue departures from that mode of trial or

from any of the essential elements thereof, and with a caution increasing in degree as the offenses dealt with increase in gravity.
389

This is a serious and weighty responsibility. 39°

To discharge that serious and weighty responsibility, the Advisory Committee should draft Rule 23 so that the trial court should
receive as much relevant information as possible. The victim may be well situated to provide useful information about how the
public will view a nonjury trial. The proposed rule change takes the modest step of allowing the victim to be heard before the
court approves any nonjury trial.

(New) Rules 32(e), (f), (h), and (i) - Disclosure of the Presentence Report to Victims and Opportunity for Victims to Object and
Be Heard 3°! The Proposals:

In the federal system, the presentence report is a critical part of the sentencing process. I therefore recommended that the
prosecutor should be required to disclose relevant parts of the presentence report to victims as follows:
[*929]

(ec) Disclosing the Report and Recommendation.

(1) Time to Disclose. Unless the defendant has consented in writing, the probation officer must not submit a presentence report
to the court or disclose its contents to anyone until the defendant has pleaded guilty or nolo contendere, or has been found

guilty.

(2) Minimum Required Notice. The probation officer must give the presentence report to the defendant, the defendant's
attorney, and an attorney for the government at least 35 days before sentencing unless the defendant waives this minimum
period. The attorney for the government shall, if any victim requests, communicate the relevant contents of the presentence
report to the victim.

387 Fed._R. Crim. P. 23(a)(2). See generally ABA Standards for Criminal Justice § 15-1.2, cmt. at 15.17 (2d ed. 1980) (concluding that
arguments in favor of requiring prosecutorial approval of jury trial waivers outweigh those against). But see Adam H. Kurland, Providing a
Federal Criminal Defendant with a Unilateral Right to a Bench Trial: A Renewed Call to Amend Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 23(a),
26 ULC. Davis L. Rev. 309, 316 (1993) (arguing that the requirements of prosecutorial consent and court approval should be removed from
Rule 23(a)).

388 Bed. R. Crim. P. 23(a)(3); ef. Akhil Reed Amar, The Bill of Rights as a Constitution, /00 Yale LJ. 1131, 1196-98 (1991) (suggesting that
jury trial right might not be waivable).

389 Patton v. United States, 281 U.S. 276, 312-13 (1930) (internal quotation marks omitted).

390 United States v. Saadva, 750 F.2d 1419, 1421 (9th Cir. 1985) (internal citation omitted).

391 Tn addition to the changes to Rule 32 discussed here, the Advisory Committee essentially adopted verbatim my proposals to amend Rules
32(a), 32(c)(1)(B), and 32(d)(2)(B). Compare Cassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 886, 887, 891, with Proposed Amendments,
supra note 71, R. 32(a), 32(c)(1)(B), 32(d)(2)(B), at 10-15. There is, accordingly, no need to discuss those proposed rules here.

The Advisory Committee also declined to add my proposal that the probation officer determine whether the victim wished to have any
material included in the presentence report. See Cassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 889. I will rely on my original article to
make the case for this particular change. See id. at 889-91

Lufthansa airliner the following month.

Added to Israeli public’s shock over the massacre, there was anger at having
to watch the murderers go free. In the weeks afterwards, I got occasional hints
that a sustained Israeli response was underway, though I didn’t know the details.
I was not aware that it was Ahrahle, at the direction of Golda herself, who was
co-ordinating it. Nor that a special Mossad team was at the center of the
operation. Yet from news reports of a series of attacks on suspected leaders of
Black September, I, and most Israelis, assumed we were determined to convey a
message which the Germans had not: that terror killings of the sort perpetrated
in Munich would not go unanswered.

It was not until late 1972 that I knew the full scale of the operation. We had
no formal ties with the Mossad, but our intelligence work occasionally
overlapped. In mid-December, the sayeret’s intelligence liaison was approached
with a “theoretical question” by a couple of guys from the Mossad. Did we have
the capability to attack three separate flats in a pair of apartment buildings in
Beirut. I sent back my preliminary answer a few days later. I said it was
possible. But there was no way I could say for sure without more information.
Would the people in the apartments be armed? Were there guards outside? Was
there a caretaker or concierge? Was there only one way in to the buildings, or
also rear entrances? Would we be able to get a plan of the interior of the
apartments?

In another month, they came up with most of the answers. The buildings
were fairly new, with glassed-in lobby areas and concierges. The Mossad men
also gave us a fairly detailed layout of two of the three apartments. They did not
know whether there were back entrances. They thought it was likely there were
bodyguards, or at least some security detail posted outside. As for the people
living in the apartments, all of them were likely to have at least small arms.

Over the next week or so, we raised a series of other questions. Mainly, I
wanted to know whether they were sure the people we’d be looking for would
be at home. The Mossad officers said they were working on that, but were
confident of being able to confirm this before any operation happened. Though
they didn’t identify the people they were targeting, I had now learned, through
Ahrahle and others, what had been pretty obvious since the Mossad’s initial
approach. They were Palestinian leaders with ties to Black September. “I think
it’s possible,” I finally told them. ““We’ll put a plan in place. We can finalize the
arrangements if you come back and say you want us to do it.”

ing from the bombing of Pan Am Flight
103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. The court
found it had subject matter jurisdiction
over defendant Libya, a designated state
sponsor of terror, pursuant to § 1605(a)(7)
of the FSIA. Rew, 995 F.Supp. at 329-30.
Noting that the FSIA provides for person-
al jurisdiction as long as subject matter
jurisdiction exists and proper service was
effected, the court turned to Libya’s con-
tacts with the United States. Jd. at 330
(citing Burger King, 471 US. at 472, 105
S.Ct. 2174). It found that Libya’s contacts
with the United States were sufficient be-
cause its allegedly “intentional, tortious ac-
tions [were] ... ‘expressly aimed at’ the
United States,” and included “destruction
of a United States flag aircraft ... while
en route to the United States ... with 189
United States nationals on board.” Jd.
(citing Calder, 465 U.S. at 789, 104 S.Ct.
1482). The court concluded that its exer-
cise of personal jurisdiction was appropri-
ate since “[alny foreign state would know
that the United States has substantial in-
terests in protecting its flag carriers and
its nationals from terrorist activities and
should reasonably expect that if these in-
terests were harmed, it would be subject
to a variety of potential responses, includ-
ing civil actions in the United States.” Jd.

Similarly, in Dalibertt the court found it
had subject matter jurisdiction over defen-
dant Iraq, a designated state sponsor of
terror, in a case stemming from the al-
leged torture of several United States citi-
zens who were working in Kuwait. Dal-
bertt, 97 F.Supp.2d at 46. Iraq argued
that exercising personal jurisdiction over it
would offend constitutional due process
since the FSIA “abrogates the minimum
contacts requirement.” Jd. at 52. The
court disagreed and explained that “Con-
eress expressly addressed the minimum
contacts requirement in enacting the FSIA
by providing that ‘[plersonal jurisdiction
over a foreign state shall exist as to every

349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES

claim for relief over which the district
courts have jurisdiction”” Jd. (citing 28
U.S.C. § 183000); Shapiro v. Republic of
Bolivia, 930 F.2d 1018, 1020 (2d Cir.1991)).
The court acknowledged that the foreign
state’s contacts with the United States
might be more attenuated in the context of
the state sponsor of terrorism exception
than in the FSIA’s other exceptions, but
concluded “in the context of this statute,
the purpose for which it was enacted, and
the nature of the activity toward which it
is directed, ... it is reasonable that for-
eign states be held accountable in the
courts of the United States for terrorist
actions perpetrated against U.S. citizens
anywhere.” Jd. at 54. Finally, it noted
that the “detention of these three plaintiffs
had a direct effect in the United States
and was consciously designed to affect
United States policy ... Iraq cannot now
claim surprise at the assertion of jurisdic-

Most recently, in Pugh, representatives
of passengers killed in the bombing of a
French airliner in Africa survived a motion
to dismiss by the individual defendants.
The court found it had subject matter ju-

cluding Muammar Qadhafi, pursuant to
the state sponsor of terrorism exception of
the FSIA outlined in § 1605(a)(7). Pugh,
290 F.Supp.2d at 58. In its personal juris-
diction analysis, the court concluded that
the individuals had sufficient contacts with
the United States to satisfy due process
since they had “conspired to sabotage” a
flight, which was scheduled to “stop in
several nations,” thus making it foresee-
able that “passengers of many nationalities
would be on board.” Jd. at 59. From
their actions, the defendants could have
expected to be haled into “the courts of
those nations whose citizens would die.”

This was before the baby. And I asked him -- I asked him

for like 300. I don't I couldn't

tell you how I got it

was he there when you went to get the money?
No.

Do you know was he in town or did you call him?

fp PF Pp

I don't even -

Q. Was that the only time that he gave you money

that wasn't connected either to a massage or to bringing
a girl?

A. He bought gifts for the baby shower. TI can't
remember now. Not off the top of my head, no. I never
asked him for anything because I just felt -- I'm not
like that, you know. I'm not a user and I'm not -- I
don't like that. I've never asked him for money, so --

Q. What about presents, either birthday presents?
You mentioned gifts for the baby. Any other gifts that
he gave you?

A. Yeah, he gave me a -- he had went to Brazil and
he came back with a whole bunch of bikinis and he told me
to choose one, so I chose one.

Q. Any other gifts, Christmastime or birthdays or

anything like that?

owns residences in New Mexico, St. Thomas and Palm Beach,
FL. The allegations herein concern Epstein’s conduct while at his

lavish estate in Palm Beach.” The complaint continued:

Upon information and belief, Epstein has a sexual preference
and obsession for underage minor girls. He engaged in a plan
and scheme in which he gained access to primarily economi-
cally disadvantaged minor girls in his home, sexually
assaulted these girls, and then gave them money. In or about
2004-2005, Jane Doe, then approximately 16 years old, fell
into Epstein’s trap and became one of his victims.

Upon information and belief, Jeffrey Epstein carried out
his schemes and assaulted girls in Florida, New York, and on

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012822.txt,"come back to a critical point in this chapter: areas that evolved for one function are readily recruited for
others, especially in a promiscuous brain like ours. As long as something makes us feel good, whether it
is winning, eating, social comparison, or harming another, the reward areas of the brain turn on.

Schadenfreude is one of the mind’s ambassadors, enabling us to journey from a state of inferiority
to superiority. It enables “imaginary revenge” in the words of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche.
Like envy, it is highly adaptive, focusing our attention on inequities. Like envy, it is also maladaptive,
rewarding us when the inequity is not only addressed, but results in another’s failure and misery. If failure
is associated with violence, including death, so be it. The brain is poised to inspire our desire to harm or

witness harm in order to feel good.

An appetite for violence

Billions of people, perhaps all humans, have had vivid fantasies about sex, violence, or sexual violence.
Are these fantasies like food fantasies, cravings that need to be satisfied? Or, as some theories would have
it, are sexual and violent fantasies satisfying on their own, playing a cathartic role, releasing energy and
thus, reducing the need to act out?

Seung-Hui Cho was born in South Korea and then moved to the United States with his parents.
During his first three years in college, both students and professors in his literature and theatre courses
described his writings as disturbing and disgusting, and his actions toward other students as ominous and
frightening. One professor noted that his creative pieces “seemed very angry,” while another demanded
that he be removed from the class. A classmate noted that his plays were “really morbid and grotesque...I
remember one of them very well. It was about a son who hated his stepfather. In the play, the boy threw a
chainsaw around and hammers at him. But the play ended with the boy violently suffocating the father
with a Rice Krispy treat.” Cho was advised to seek counseling. He didn’t. No one followed up. A
professor aware of his often inappropriate comments and behavior contacted members of the
administration. No response. Several women alerted the campus police after Cho stalked them. No
disciplinary action was taken despite his repeated offenses. As in the SEC’s tin ear to the alarms
surrounding Madoff’s dubious securities, so too was everyone at Cho’s university deaf to his alarming
behavior in class and out.

During his senior year, Cho wrote an essay describing his anger toward rich kids, the unfairness
of life, and his own misery. He also described a revenge fantasy, packed with images of retaliation
toward those who had what he lacked. He sent his reflections along with excessively violent photographs
and videotapes to the New York headquarters of NBC news. Under a photograph of bullets he provided
the caption “All the [shit] you've given me, right back at you with hollow points.

Penetrating the NSA and getting access to files from its stove-piped computers was a far
more difficult challenge for the SVR. Approaching CIA officers, such as Nicholson, was relatively
easy because it was part of the CIA officer’s job to meet with their adversaries. NSA officers, on
the other hand, did not engage in “dangles” or even attend diplomatic receptions. They had not
reason, other than a sinister one, to meet with a member of the Russian intelligence service.
Furthermore, unlike CIA officers who, like Nicholson, are often posted in neutral countries where
they can be approached in a social context, NSA officers worked at well-guarded regional bases
and are not part of the diplomatic life. Since a known employee of a foreign diplomatic mission
could not even approach a NSA officer without arousing suspicion, the SVR would need to use
an intermediary, called an “access agent,” whose affiliations with it were not known to the FBI.
Such an operation would require establishing a network of illegals in the America, as the SVR did
after Putin became President. Even them, the intermediary would have to find a plausible pretext
to approach the target with revealing his actual interest.

The emergence of computer networks in the 1990s greatly expanded the SVR’s recruiting
horizon. It offered an opportunity to penetrate a new layer at the NSA employees: civilian
technologists working under contract for the US government. Many of these civilians at the
NSA, especially the younger ones, had been drawn from the hacking and game-playing culture.
Some had even taken courses abroad on hacking techniques. They presented the SVR was
inviting targets for recruitment. As was previously mentioned, Russian intelligence had
considerable experience in Germany with hacktavists who tended to be anarchists. There were
also supporters of the Libertarian movement. The common denominator was often their
resentment expressed in their postings s of the United States and its allies attempting to limit the
downloading of copy-righted music, movies and software on the Internet, all of which went under
the rubric of “freedom of the Internet.” They also vocally objected to the NSA using built-in
backdoors in their software to read their encrypted messages. They were not difficult to find on
the Internet. The donors to Ron Paul’s Libertarian election campaign (including Snowden) were
a matter of public record, for example.

Even if there was no shortage of hacktavists who believed the surveillance of the Internet by
the NSA was an evil worth fighting, the SVR still had to find a plausible way of approaching
members of this counterculture without offending them. Clearly, the SVR could no longer use
out- of-date Communist and anti-capitalist ideology as a lure. Russia was far more authoritarian
than the U.S, when it came to the Internet. One viable alternative for the SVR was custom-
tailoring false flags to appeal to hacktavists.

For this purpose the Internet provided a near perfect realm for false flags. Since it is a place
where true identities cannot easily be verified, intelligence services could employ a protean kit of
disguises to assume false identities to entice potential dissidents into communicating with them.
The KGB’s earlier efforts to use hacktavist groups in Germany had produced little, if any,
intelligence because of the “stove-piping” the NSA used to isolate its computers from networks

Hi Jeffrey, 
Sorry for the phone tag. In case it's easier to respond by email, I have put my questions below. I'm at my desk and should be

Best,

-what is the square footage of your Manhattan home? 
-do you work on a laptop from your dining room, with a large white board for notes and several pairs of reading glasses close at 
hand? Is the dining room windowless? 
-do paparazzi often camp outside your home? 
-did Michael once visit on the same day as a head of state who'd had a police escort? 
-did you tell Michael about a dinner you'd hosted for six tech entrepreneurs who had a combined worth of several hundred 
billion dollars? When was this meal? 
-Do you believe that there are now more people who possess Roosevelt or Carnegie-levels of wealth, the sort that can rival 
governments in influence? That these people face unusual challenges when entering philanthropy due to the sheer size of 
their fortunes? That the rich may know the business that made them rich, but not money itself? 
-are you interested in what will happen to the $4.2 trillion possessed by the super-rich in 40-odd years once they have mostly 
died? 
-Do you believe no superrich people want to give their entire fortunes to their children for fear of how it might affect them? 
-do you advise the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on how to convince other billionaires to join their initiatives? 
-did you volunteer to invest $20 million dollars in Michael's attempt to buy New York Magazine in 2004? 
-do you believe the recent claims about Alan Dershowitz and Prince Andrew in relation to you are ludicrous ? 
-When you met Michael for lunch in the West Village, was it the first time in 10 years you'd gone to lunch at a restaurant? 
-Do you have a support staff of young women in their 20s and 30s? Have some of them worked for you for many years, through 
their own marriages and as they raise families? Have any of these employees been romantically involved with you? When 
Michael came to your home, had one of these women recently gone on an around the world honeymoon, which you 
arranged? Do they often travel with you to your other homes — in New Mexico, Paris, Palm Beach, and in the Caribbean? Do 
you maintain there is no quid-pro-quo in the relationships with these women? Do these women often socialize with the policy 
makers and businessmen with whom you often meet? 
-Is your current girlfriend a dental student you met four years ago at a dinner party in New York? 
-Did you date Eva Andersson Dubin? Have you known her for 30 years? Did you pay for her to go to medical school? 
-when you take meetings in your Manhattan dining room, do you take your guests out to a Sabrett hot dog cart? Will the 
women who work for you accompany you? 
-Did you invite Michael to sit in on a presentation by a group of quants? Are you looking for a group of quants who have 
developed promising investing algorithms, and do you plan to invest $5 million with each? 
-during U.N. Week in late September, did you host a Sunday night discussion with Bill Gates, Mort Zuckerman, and Peter Thiel? 
Was anyone else in attendance? Were you discussing a possible Gates Foundation donor advised fund? 
-Did you host Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim and several others from Qatar? Do you know if the Sheikh has a home across the street 
from you in Manhattan? Did they talk to you about bribery compromising their bid for the World Cup? When was this? Did 
they bring a gift of chocolate made with pistachios grown on the Sheikh's farm? 
-The morning after the Qataris came over, did you have a 9 AM breakfast with the attorney Reid Weingarten? Did you discuss 
his defense of CT governor John Rowland, the Qatari visit, and who controls ISIS? Did Weingarten believe Turkey was using ISIS 
as a proxy against the Kurds? 
-After this, did you meet with Brock Pierce to discuss bitcoin? Did Larry Summers join this meeting? 
-That evening, did you host Australian PM Kevin Rudd and Thorborn Jagland for a cocktail party? Did Jagland critique US 
foreign policy? Did you offer to fly him back to Europe on your jet? 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025875 
-The following morning, did Ehud Barack come over for breakfast? Did he have an omelet? Did he defend both Putin and 
Obama? 
-Was this followed by a senior White House official, whose name you don't want mentioned? 
-Did you then meet with Elisa New to discuss supporting a poetry series and other sources of funding? Did you forcefully 
critique her proposed budget? 
-After meeting with New, did you meet with the following: Hardeep Purie, Kairat Kelimbetov, Nathan Myhrvold, Martin 
Nowak, Richard Axel, Ron Baron, Josh Harris? Have you funded Nowak's program at Harvard with $30 million? 
-did Michael join a lunch at your home with Bill Richardson? 
-do you believe powerful people seek your advice because you're not affiliated with any institution, so you have no ulterior 
motives when giving them advice? 
-is your Paris home a 10,000 sq ft apartment on Avenue Foch? Does it have a stuffed baby elephant in its living room? Is it 
meant as a reminder that elephants have 23 copies of tumor suppressor genes? 
-Is the only book on your bedside table Lolita? Are you a fan of Nabokov? 
-Did you tell Michael that he should make a particular $100k investment in early September? What was it?

Nielsen could not say what specifically the unauthorized
work consists of, but said DPNR Commissioner nominee
Jean-Pierre Oriol would be available by phone today to
answer questions about the situation.

Documents on file at the Coastal Zone Management division

of DPNR show that Epstein used “Great St. Jim, LLC,” a shell

company organized by St. Thomas attorney Erika Kellerhals,

to purchase three parcels totaling 80.1 acres from the Danish
Kjaer family for $17.5 million on Jan. 18, 2016.

The remainder of the island — 12 parcels totaling 81.22 acres
— was transferred from another St. Thomas company, GSJ
Properties Corp., to Great St. Jim LLC for $5 million on Jan.
21, 2016.

While it’s long been rumored that Epstein had purchased
Great St. James, for years his name appeared nowhere on
publicly available documents listing property ownership of
the island.

The Daily News requested access to documents contained in
Coastal Zone Management permit application files for the
island on April 18, and was provided access to those records
Monday.

The documents show that in 2011, Kellerhals, another
attorney in her firm, Gregory Ferguson, and business
consultant Brett Geary organized the St. Thomas company
Poplar Inc.

A certificate of incumbency contained in the file lists Epstein
as president of Poplar Inc., his longtime lawyer Darren
Indyke is listed as vice president and secretary, and another
longtime associate, Richard Kahn, is listed as treasurer.

The Daily Beast reported in April that Kellerhals, Indyke, and
Kahn are listed as the only officers of other defunct
nonprofits run by Epstein, including the C.0.U.Q.
Foundation, J. Epstein Virgin Islands Foundation, and Epstein
Interests. They’re also listed as officers for Gratitude America
Ltd., anonprofit formed in the Virgin Islands in 2012 through
which Epstein has made financial contributions to various

organizations.

The certificate specifically states that those individuals are
authorized to act on behalf of the corporation with respect to
all transactions, “including but not limited to transactions
related to permitting matters submitted on behalf of Great
St. Jim, LLC.”

rage. Subjects also provided their personal opinions on which individual, within the pair, they liked most,
wanted to make happy or destroy, was most deserving of punishment, and most likely had a soul.

I assume that everyone reading about the design of this study has already formed an opinion
about some of the comparisons. Presumably everyone believes that a living adult is more consciously
aware than a dead person, fetus, dog, and robot. Presumably everyone believes that all animals feel more
pain than a dead human or a robot. And presumably everyone would rather make a dog happy than a
frog, and would be more likely to allocate souls to fetuses, babies, and adult humans than to robots and
frogs. But are we more conscious than God? Does a chimpanzee feel more embarrassed than a baby? Can
a person in a vegetative state feel more pleasure than a frog or robot? What dimensions, if any, cause us
to lasso some things together but not others? What things cluster together and why? As a reminder: this
study is about our intuitions, not about what scientists have discovered about the minds and emotions of
these different things.

Adding up the large set of responses produced a map or landscape defined by two dimensions:
experience and agency. Experience included properties such as hunger, fear, pain, pleasure, rage, desire,
consciousness, pride, embarrassment, and joy. Agency included self-control, morality, memory, emotion
recognition, planning, communication and thinking. Experience aligned with feelings, agency with
thinking. With these dimensions, we find God at one edge, high in agency and low in experience. On the
opposite side, huddled together on the landscape, defined by low agency and high experience, we find
fetuses, frogs, and people in a vegetative state. High in both agency and experience were adult men and
women. Robots and dead people were low on experience and in the middle for agency, whereas dogs,
chimpanzees, and human kids were high on experience and middling on agency. This landscape not only
helps us understand how people classify these different entities, but also plays a more active role in
guiding individuals’ judgments to punish, provide pleasure, and avoid harm. If you have to harm
something, pick an entity low in experience, such as dead people and robots who can’t suffer. If you have
to punish something, pick an entity high in agency, such as living adults who recognize the difference
between right and wrong and have the capacity for self-control.

What this work shows is that people have strong intuitions about which things are morally
responsible as agents and which are deserving of our moral concerns as patients. Moral patients are high
in experience, and can thus suffer as victims, innocent or not. This is why many countries have created
laws against harming nonhuman animals, including restrictions on which animals can serve in laboratory
experiments, what can be done to them, and how they should be housed. This is also why we don’t do
experiments on fetuses, newborns, adults in a vegetative state, or humans with neurological disorders that

knock out aspects of their experience and agency. Once something enters the arena of moral patients, we

to one of the terminal buildings, they were threatening to start killing them
unless we freed a list of 53 Palestinians and PLO supporters, forty of them held
in Israel and the rest in a number of European countries, and paid a ransom of
five million dollars.

Well past midnight, we started looking at our options. One which seemed —
briefly — to hold promise drew on suggestions from Ido Ambar and Mookie.
Ido’s almost rhapsodic description of the capabilities of our C-130 Hercules
transport planes convinced us we could parachute in a Sayeret Matkal team, as
well as vehicles for them to use on the ground. Mookie and I agreed that to
ensure surprise, we would disguise the commandos as Ugandan troops, in
“Ugandan” Jeeps. The final twist came with the arrival of the reserve air force
officer who had been on training duty in Entebbe. He brought a reel of 8mm
film from an official ceremony at the airport. At the start, a Ugandan army
general could be seen arriving in a black Mercedes. “That’s it!” Mookie said.
“The Mercedes. Every top Ugandan military officer has one.” We decided to
swap one of our Jeeps for a jet-black limousine.

Yet by daybreak on Wednesday, when I went up to brief Motto, we'd set
aside the option of a parachute drop. Any initial surprise would be outweighed
by the risk of exposure from the very start of the assault. We’d also gone cold
on a second option, to infiltrate sayeret teams along the shore of Lake Victoria
from across the nearby border in Kenya. I doubted we had enough time to
navigate all the operational and diplomatic obstacles before the deadline
expired. That left option three: having the SEALs, along with a core team from
the sayeret, parachute onto Lake Victoria with rubber dinghies and attack the
airport from on foot. We arranged to do a test parachute assault off the Israeli
coast in Haifa later in the day, but if that went well, it seemed the only practical
alternative.

Motta and I went met Peres around 8:30am. Shimon had no first-hand
military experience, having played a political role alongside Ben-Gurion from
Israel’s early years. So he was not really interested in the details. But he was
keen to hear our assurances that a military option did exist. He was even more
intrigued when we were joined by the head of the air force, Benny Peled.
Unaware of the airborne parachute drop we had been discussing overnight,
Peled suggested something far more ambitious. Rather than using a single
Hercules, he proposed using four of the giant transport planes to ferry in a larger
force, some 200 men in all, land them on one of the runways and take over the

¢ Earlier versions of the U.S attorney’s charges, including a sealed 53-page indictment, could have landed
Epstein in prison for 20 years.

* Victims alleged that Epstein molested underage girls from South America, Europe, and the former Soviet
republics, including three 12-year-old girls brought over from France as a birthday gift.

¢ The victims also alleged trips out of state and abroad on Epstein’s private jets, which would be evidence of
sex trafficking—a much more serious federal crime than the state charges Epstein was convicted of.

* Epstein’s attorneys investigated members of the Palm Beach Police Department, while others ordered private
investigators to follow and intimidate the victims’ families; one even posed as a police officer.

¢ Then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told The Daily Beast that he “would have instructed the Justice
Department to pursue justice without making a political mess.”

Film director Roman Polanski is not the only convicted pedophile to walk free this month and return to a life of
privilege. On Wednesday, hedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein completes his one-year house arrest in Palm
Beach, which has been even less arduous than Polanski’s time at a Swiss ski chalet.

Watch Jeffrey Epstein Storm Out of a Deposition When Asked About His Penis

During Epstein’s term of “house arrest,” he made several trips each month to his New York home and his
private Caribbean island. In the earlier stage of his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor—13
months in the Palm Beach Stockade—he was allowed out to his office each day. Meanwhile, Epstein has settled
more than a dozen lawsuits brought by the underage girls who were recruited to perform “massages” at his
Palm Beach mansion. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each
received well over $1 million—an amount that will hardly dent Epstein’s $2 billion net worth.

* The Billionaire Pedphile's Sex Den

With that, the known victims of Epstein’s sexual compulsion have been officially silenced, and the case against
him is closed unless new ones come forward. According to banking sources, he has been moving assets out of
the U.S. and may well follow Polanski into a luxurious exile.

But the question remains: Did Epstein’s wealth and social connections—former President Bill Clinton; Prince
Andrew; former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak; New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson; and former Treasury
Secretary Larry Summers were just a few of the prominent passengers on his private jets—allow him to receive
only a slap on the wrist for crimes that carry a mandatory 20-year sentence? Was he able, with his limitless
assets and heavy-hitting lawyers—Alan Dershowitz, Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black, Kenneth Starr, Guy Lewis,
and Martin Weinberger among them—to escape equal justice?

whether these were discretionary func-

actions involved an element of choice or
judgment based on considerations of public
policy. See Callahan v. United States, 329

Accordingly, to the extent that Plaintiffs

Prince Sultan’s and Prince Turki’s motions
to dismiss the certain consolidated com-

Plaintiffs have not presented any factual

the BJP and Congress, it got the most votes nationally of any party in the
election. Yet it failed to win a single constituency. By contrast the BJP not
only collected a huge tally of votes but also turned those efficiently into
seats. With 31% of the national vote-share, they captured nearly 52% of
the seats in parliament.

That suggests an important shift in Indian politics. The BJP did
extraordinarily well because it approached the election in a far more
professional, strategic and efficient way than its rivals. The methods it
employed were modern, and the skill at which Mr Modi and his fellow
leaders conducted their campaigns rivalled the sort of performances put in
by American presidential contenders (and with similar quantities of money
to spend). Rahul Gandhi of Congress, in the end, proved to be a hopeless
amateur, poorly advised without even decent media-management skills or
the ability to present a strong campaign message. Many regional figures
proved similarly out of date in their campaigning. The BJP’s roadshows
and rallies, the door-knocking by volunteers, the influence on India’s press
and television channels, the ability to set the agenda of discussion, all went
to making the election a remarkably one-sided affair. The chief minister of
Bihar, Nitish Kumar, tendered his resignation on May 17th, after his party
was flattened by the BJP in the state. (Assam’s chief minister, from
Congress, has also offered to quit.) That was not because of anti-
incumbency—voters in Bihar are happy with the work Mr Kumar has
been doing—but because the BJP’s campaign was vastly superior.

Mr Modi in his first speeches after his victory has sounded magnanimous
and made the right noises about running the country for all, bringing
everyone along. He also mentioned, only partly accurately, that the BJP’s
success transcended caste politics and religious appeals. If that were
entirely true, 1t would be another reason to call this election result historic.
In fact the BJP did make some use of caste and religion, as when Mr Modi
played up his “other backward classes” background while campaigning in
Uttar Pradesh, or when he criticized Bangladeshi (read: Muslim)
infiltrators in Assam and West Bengal. It is troubling, too, that the new
parliament will have the fewest Muslim members of any since 1952, while

Your Highness, Dubai was accused in the media that laid-off Arabs descend from a
specific nationality, what is the reality?

Rumors feed on human emotion. Verifiable facts, and even simple common sense, have little or nothing to do
with the way a rumor spreads. I would say that due to the steep global crisis effect on domains such as PR and
advertising, which employ by coincidence a large number from a particular nationality, or the construction
sector which also employs a large number of architects from one nationality, there is absolutely no focus on
laying off any Arab or non-Arab nationality.

Your Highness, your recent visit to Russia complements your strategy in visiting the
strong economic countries worldwide such as Germany and China last year. Do you
think that these visits are still useful nowadays? Are you planning to20continue this
approach and what is the objective of those visits? What was the outcome of your last
visit to Moscow?

This is a strange question. We are pretty sure that this crisis will not last forever, and that it will end. The UAE
has always had good relations with all countries around the world and especially the weighty economic
countries. Our duty is to work toward developing and enhancing those relationships. In fact, during global

result in forming a new economic and political world construct.

federal and local levels in the UAE as rumors are spreading regarding a change in
progress in the cabinet?

It is obvious that things do change. Whoever does not take up the new situation and cooperate positively with it
for the benefit of the nation and nationals would be incompetent. However, it is you who’s saying that there are
rumors that a change in the cabinet is under way.

Al Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi

Your Highness, people who are aware of the relationship between Dubai and Abu Dhabi
say that there is no need to worry about the effect of the crisis on Dubai because it relies at
the end of the day on the financial strength of Abu Dhabi, which owns the biggest
sovereign fund in the world. What would you say?

Those people know well that they can’t bracket the relationship between both Emirates into just a financial
relation. The money element is a very minimal component in a superior relationship built on family ties with a
unity soul, with “tolerance” essence and foundation concurred by both Sheikh Zayed and Sheikh Rashid on 18

How Jim Yong Kim, Obama's World Bank Pick, 
Changed Global Health Aid 
By Massoud Hayoun 
Mar 23 2012, 2:04 PM ET 
The international public health work that made Kim, now the president's nominee for World Bank head, such a 
respected figure. 
President Obama introduces Jim Yong Kim as his nominee to be the next president of the World Bank /Reuters 
President Obama announced today that he will nominate Dartmouth College President Jim Yong Kim to head 
the World Bank. Although Kim is a physician by training, officials have observed that Kim's role as a key 
player in global health and development, notably with his role in the organization Partners in Health (PIH), 
makes him a key candidate to change the attitudes of developing-world nations. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 013460 
The following excerpts from Tracy Kidder's Mountains Beyond Mountains, a biography of anthropologist and 
physician Paul Farmer, detail Kim's bold efforts to combat international HIV and tuberculosis epidemics with 
PIH: 
Some months after the official founding of PIH, [co-founder] Paul Farmer expanded the group, adding a fellow 
Harvard anthropology and medical student, a Korean American named Jim Yong Kim... Farmer offered what 
for Jim Kim was a convincing vision of the new organization. The reality was less impressive -- a charity with a 
board of advisers and no hired staff... 
They talked about issues such as political correctness, which Jim Kim defined as follows: It's a very well-
crafted tool to distract us. A very self-centered activity. Clean up your own vocabulary so you can show 
everybody you have the social capital of having been in circles where these things are talked about on a regular 
basis. (What was an example of political correctness? Some academic types would say to Jim and Paul, Why 
do you call your patients poor people? They don't call themselves poor people. Jim would reply: Okay, how 
about soon-dead people?) 
They talked about the insignificance of cultural barriers when it came to the Haitian peasant's acceptance of 
modern Western medicine: There's nothing like a cure for a disease to change people's cultural values... 
By now Peru was taxing PIH's resources severely. On average, the drugs to treat just one patient cost between 
fifteen and twenty thousand dollars. And the number of patients kept growing. Already there were about fifty 
Carabayllanos in treatment. Their average age was twenty-nine. They were students, unemployed youths, 
housewives, street vendors, bus drivers, health workers. The actual numbers seemed small, but those fifty MDR 
[a form of tuberculosis that does not respond to standard treatment] cases represented about 10 percent of all 
active cases of TB in the slum, about ten times more than might have been expected. No telling how many 
others they had been infecting as they'd traveled around Lima, coughing. No telling either how many people in 
other parts of the city already had MDR, but [there were] reports of hundreds in other neighborhoods. In 
Carabayllo itself, the Socios workers found entire families sick and dying with what turned out to be genetically 
related strains of the disease--a phenomenon common enough that the health workers gave it a name, familias 
tebeceanas, tuberculosis families. 
Kim's organization confronted Peru's MDR-form tuberculosis epidemic with what some have called unorthodox 
practices -- borrowing and cajoling its way into medicine for its patients. 
Howard Hiatt, a friend of Jim Yong Kim's and a former dean at the Harvard School of Public Health, said he 
was concerned about how PIH was getting medicine to combat the epidemic: 
Sure enough. Paul and Jim would stop at the [Harvard-affiliated] Brigham pharmacy before they left for Peru 
and fill their briefcases with drugs. They had sweet-talked various people into letting them walk away with the 
drugs. [Hiatt] was amused, all in all. That's their Robin Hood attitude. In fact, they'd only borrowed the 
drugs... 
Then one day the president of the Brigham stopped Hiatt in a corridor. Your friends Farmer and Kim are in 
trouble with me. They owe this hospital ninety-two thousand dollars. Hiatt looked into the matter. Sure 
enough. Paul and Jim would stop at the Brigham pharmacy before they left for Peru and fill their briefcases with 
drugs. They had sweet-talked various people into letting them walk away with the drugs. He was amused, all in 
all. That's their Robin Hood attitude. 
To many seasoned managers of public health projects, what Farmer and Kim were doing would have looked 
quite reckless--like a stunt, as some would later insinuate. They didn't have a guaranteed supply of drugs, only 
the determination to obtain the drugs and the charm to get away with borrowing. They were borrowing their 
laboratory services, too, from Massachusetts. They lacked proper institutional support. The weight of expert 
opinion stood against them. Their organization was small and it had other projects, in Haiti and Boston and 
elsewhere, and Peru put a strain on everyone. Jim had to travel to Carabayllo at least once a month. Farmer had 
to go there slightly more often. 
Kim's audacious 'Robin Hood attitude' won him and PIH acclaim for their role in changing global health and 
development. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 013461 
In June 2002 ... the WHO adopted new prescriptions for dealing with MDR-TB, virtually the same as PIH had 
used in Carabayllo. For Jim Kim this marked the end of a long campaign. The world changed yesterday, he 
wrote from Geneva to all of PIH. The prices of second-line antibiotics continued to decline, and the drugs now 
flowed fairly smoothly through the Green Light Committee to, among other places, Peru, where about 1,000 
chronic patients were either cured or in treatment. About 250 were receiving the drugs in Tomsk, and, largely 
because of the efforts of WHO, the Russian Ministry of Health had finally agreed to the terms of the World 
Bank's TB loan--150 million dollars to begin to fight the epidemic throughout the country. 
The twin pandemics of AIDS and tuberculosis raged on, of course, magnifying each other, in Africa and Asia, 
Eastern Europe and Latin America. Mathematical models predicted widening global catastrophe--100 million 
HIV infections in the world by the year 2010. Some prominent voices, some in the U.S. government, still 
argued that AIDS could not be treated in desperately impoverished places. But this view seemed to be fading. 
The prices of antiretrovirals were falling, even more dramatically than the prices of second-line TB drugs. 
This was thanks to a growing worldwide campaign for treating AIDS wherever it occurred. Jim Kim had often 
said that the world's response to AIDS and TB would define the moral standing of his generation. In 2003, a 
new director general took over at WHO, and he asked Jim to serve as his senior adviser. Meanwhile, the 
example of Zanmi Lasante [PIH's Haiti-based project] was growing, and Cange had become a favorite 
destination for global health policy makers and American politicians.

children? Being left out terrorizes children. Why do we allow this to
happen by creating places that foster this behavior?

Stifling of curiosity: Isn't it obvious that learning is really about
curiosity? Adults learn about things they want to learn about. Before
the age of 6, prior to school, one kid becomes a dinosaur specialist,
while another knows all about dog breeds. Outside of school, people
drive their own learning. Schools eliminate this natural behavior.

Subjects chosen for you: Why algebra, physics, economics,
and U.S. history? Because those subjects were pretty exciting to the
president of Harvard in 1892. And, if you are interested in something
else—psychology, business, medicine, computers, design? Too bad.
Those subjects weren’t taught at Harvard in 1892. Is that nuts or
what?

Classrooms: If you wanted to learn something and had the
money, wouldn’t you hire someone to be your mentor, and have
them be there for you while you tried out learning the new thing?
Isn’t that what small children have, a parent ready to teach as needed.
Classrooms make no sense as a venue for learning unless, of course,
you want to save money and have 30 (or, worse, hundreds of) students
handled by one teacher. Once you have ratios like that, you have to
teach by talking and then hoping someone was listening, so then you
have to have tests. Schools cannot work as places of learning if they
employ classrooms. And, of course, they pretty much all do.

Grades: Any professor can tell you that students are pretty much
concerned with whether what you are telling them will be on the
test and what they might do for extra credit. In other words, they
want a good grade. If you tell them that 2 + 2 = 5 and it will be on
the test, they will tell you that 2 + 2 = 5 if it means getting a good
grade. Parents do not give grades to children and employers do not
give grades to employees. They judge their work and progress for sure,
but not by assigning numbers to a report card.

Certification: We all know why people attend college. They do so

primarily to say they are college graduates so they can get a job or go
on to a professional school. Most don’t care all that much about what

o Buy a 6 month 105% call with a short 110% call that knock in if XLF trades above 115% during the life of the 
trade for 1.75% premium cost 
• Gross max payoff if knock-in is triggered: 2.8x (5.0%/1.75%) 
• Gross max payoff if knock-in is not triggered: 5.6x (9.9%/1.75%) — you have upside up to 114.9%

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 011277 
Underweight positioning, buybacks resuming, positive momentum and strong fundamentals all indicate that there is still 
further upside potential in financials (more details below). Our financials sector specialist thinks XLF could have another 
20-25% upside given the many levers to the Trump Trade: less regulation, higher interest rates, higher vol, economic 
growth, loan growth, etc. The asset sensitive regional banks are more of a pure play on a rates move but we view the 
larger cap banks as having multi-pronged upside given the aforementioned points. 
That said, given the velocity and magnitude of the recent move and uncertainty around the impact and timing of 
Trump's policies, we believe options offer better risk-reward than being outright long financials stocks here. With flat 
call skew, appearing call spreads with upside knock-ins price well. 
Buy a 1 year XLF call spread for 2.6% premium 
• Buy a 110% call 
• Sell a 117.5% call with an at-expiry knock-in at 125% (call is not active unless XLF is 125% or higher at expiry) 
o Total premium is 2.6% 
o Gross max payoff if knock-in is triggered: 2.9x (7.5%/2.6%) 
o Gross max payoff if knock-in is not triggered: 5.7x (14.9%/2.6%) — you have upside up to 124.9% 
Post Election Flow Skews - Buyers of Health Care (via ETFs) and Financials (mainly ETFs) 
• US Buyback Flows 
• Cons Disc, Technology and Financials are the largest 3 sectors for US buybacks (over 70% of execution). We 
are seeing a seasonal increase in buybacks as we come out of the low seasonal month of the year (October) and should  
see increased buyback executions until year-end, another source of upside for the Cons Disc, Technology and Financials  
sectors.

and are UW this sector in all regions. 
Future of Financials conference hosted 90 public and private companies at our Future of Financials conference. We are 
raising our price objectives across most of our names. Three primary reasons why we think there is upside remaining 
after the recent rally: 1) an improved outlook on both activity levels and interest rates, driving revenue upside; 2) 
potentially lower regulatory burden, particularly as new supervisory leadership can come with the new administration; 
and 3) relatively lighter positioning in US financials vs. other sectors. (Erika Najarian)

being stopped or ticketed by local police. Retired Police Chief Michael Reiter, in his own deposition,
acknowledged that, in addition to earlier donations to the police department (which are fairly common in well-
heeled Palm Beach), Epstein had recently given the department $100,000 for some sophisticated equipment.
The police were still researching the purchase when Epstein came under suspicion, and Reiter ordered the
money returned. (Guy Frostin, one of Epstein’s local attorneys, told police that Epstein also gave $100,000 to
the Florida Ballet for massages, because he was “very passionate” about massages being “therapeutically and
spiritually” beneficial. Yet victims told police they had no massage training.)

Perhaps most disturbing, in terms of possible sex trafficking, was Epstein’s relationship with Jean Luc Brunel,
owner of the MC2 modeling agency. According to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of Florida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, Maxwell, Brunel, Rodriguez, and Marcinkova
“deliberately engaged in a pattern of racketeering that involved luring minor children through MC2, mostly
girls under the age of 17, to engage in sexual play for money.” (Which would amount to trafficking.)

Brunel is a 50-plus French playboy who was formerly part owner of Karin, a Paris-based modeling agency. He
lives in New York and South Beach, Florida, and owns 85 percent of MC2, which has offices in New York,
Miami, and Tel Aviv. (The remaining 15 percent is owned by his partner, Jeff Fuller.) Brunel has been
observed as a house guest at Epstein’s Palm Beach home and may well have had contact with him also in New
York, where Epstein owns a lavish home, and in Paris, where Epstein keeps an apartment on elegant Ave. Foch.
CBS reporter Craig Pyes, who investigated Brunel for a 60 Minutes broadcast many years ago, is quoted in
Michael Gross’ book about the modeling industry, Model: The Ugly Business _of Beautiful Women. Pyes told
the author that Brunel “ranks among the sleaziest people in the fashion industry. We’re talking about a
conveyor belt, not a casting couch. Hundreds of girls were not only harassed but molested.” Now The Daily
Beast has learned that Epstein had made a $1 million wire transfer to Brunel’s offshore bank account in
September 2004, just as he was setting up MC2. Whether this was a gift or a loan or a backdoor investment in
the new venture is unknown. A French citizen who managed to avoid giving evidence in the Epstein
investigation, Brunel declined to comment on any of this, as does Fuller. Asked in April of Brunel’s activities,
Epstein said “I’m 100 percent convinced that he doesn’t traffic children.” (Brunel has never been charged.)
An American fashion designer who booked her girls through MC2 says they were very young and very
beautiful; many were from Eastern Europe and spoke little English. A former bookkeeper in the agency’s
Miami office, who also arranged visas for girls traveling to the U.S., confirmed that MC2 girls became
frequent guests on Epstein’s private jets.

Pilot logs obtained in the civil suits show that some of the named plaintiffs were on the flight manifests. Other
times, the pilot would just list the other passengers plus female.”

Attrition, the Egyptians had created an effective no-fly zone a dozen miles into
the Sinai. After the failed counter-attack, with the commander of the air force
warning that we were nearing our minimum “red line” number of fighter jets,
Golda contacted the Americans to propose a cease-fire in the south. But having
retaken the Suez Canal and pushed into the Sinai, President Sadat was in no
mood to call a halt to the fighting. The only way we were going to end the war
was to retake the canal and defeat the even larger Egyptian forces on the other
side.

To the extent that my part in war was different from other junior officers, it
was because of my history in Sayeret Matkal. Other Israeli sayerets were
attached to specific fighting forces. Sayeret Golan, for instance, was part of the
Golani infantry brigade in the north; Sayeret 7zanhanim, was part of the
paratroopers. But “matkal” is the Hebrew word for the general staff, since it was
the generals in military headquarters who had allowed Avraham Arnan to create
the unit. From the start, we had answered directly to the kirva, which ultimately
had to approve our operations. When I rushed back from Stanford at the start of
the war, I was still just a 31-year-old lieutenant-colonel. I had spent two years in
command of the equivalent of an infantry battalion. But I knew, and in many
cases had worked with, the men at the very top of the armed forces, including
Dado, the chief of staff. So while other young reservists were reporting to their
former units for assignment, my first port of call was the command bunker,
where Dado himself, aware that I’d done intensive tank training before taking
command of the sayeret, ensured that I would play my part in trying to turn
back the Egyptian advances. I also knew, or at least had met, many of the
generals plotting the counteroffensive in the command bunker in the south:
Shmuel Gonen, known as “Gorodish’’, who was head of the southern command;
Arik Sharon, who had left the same job for politics a few months earlier, but
was now commanding a division near the canal; and Chaim Bar-Lev, the former
chief-of-staff whom Golda had called back into emergency service. I even knew
the bunker. It was Um-Hashiba, the command and intelligence post from which
we had run Sayeret Matkal operations into Egypt after 1967.

So during the last, decisive 10 days of the war, I would witness first-hand the
tension among our top commanders in the Sinai, especially between Sharon and
Gorodish, since Arik wasted few opportunities to suggest, rightly but not always
helpfully, that his successor was woefully out of his depth. I would lead my
company back across the canal with one of the other main armored brigades in
the Sinai; take out Egyptian missile sites and help restore our jets’ command of

theories. Both agree that consumption can keep pace with output and capital over

time. Free growth theory asserts that they keep pace continuously.

Correlations tell the same story. Tables show that coefficients between r and g
run about 1, as with the free growth index, while correlations between f and g run

about zero.

I do not claim that anyone but Mill and | has actually proposed free growth theory,
nor that anyone at all has proposed thrift theory as here defined. It is my impression,
not assertion, that modern consensus fits thrift theory given Harrod’s qualifier that
attempted (ex ante) net saving (thrift) must not exceed the technological growth

rate (warranted growth path). My impression is that Solow and modern tradition
agree, but blunt Harrod’s knife edge. Free growth theory counters that the same
growth arrives costlessly when ex ante net saving/investment is held at zero. Nor do
I claim that data shown in my charts and tables prove free growth theory. Rather

they demonstrate that all growth has proved free wherever measured to date.

mid 1960s, who was caught in a sting operation by the FBI and sentenced to 18 years in a federal
prison. Ronald Pelton, an NSA analyst, was recruited after he retired from the NSA. After he
was betrayed by a KGB double agent in 1985, was sentenced to life imprisonment, Finally, there
was David Sheldon Boone, a NSA code clerk, who between 1988 and 1992, provided the KGB
with NSA documents in return for $60,000. Boone, sentenced to 24 years in prison, was the last
known KGB recruitment of the Cold War.

During the Cold War, Russian Intelligence Service officers operated mainly under the cover of
the embassies, consulates, United Nations delegations and other diplomatic missions of the Soviet
Union. As “diplomats,” they were protected from arrest by the terms of the 1961 Vienna
Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Their diplomatic cover greatly limited, however, their
universe for finding potential recruits outside of their universe of international meetings,
diplomatic receptions, UN organizations, scientific conferences and cultural exchanges. They
therefore tended to recruit their counterparts in adversary services.

In this regard, the successful entrapment of Harold Nicholson in the 1990s is highly instructive.
From his impressive record, he seemed an unlikely candidate for recruitment. He had been a super-
patriotic American who had served as a captain in Army intelligence before joining the CIA in
1980. In the CIA, he had an unblemished record as a career officer, serving as a station chief in
Eastern Europe and then the deputy chief of operation in Malaysia in 1992. Even though his
career was on the rise and he was a dedicated anti-Communist, he became a target for SVR when
he was assigned to the CIA’s elite Russian division. Since the job of this division was to recruit
Russian officials working abroad as diplomats, engineers and military officers, its operations
brought its officers in close contact with SVR officers. Nicholson therefore was required to meet
with Russian intelligence officers in Manila, Bucharest, Tokyo and Bangkok and “dangle” himself
to the SVR by pretending disloyalty to the CIA. As part of these deception operations, he
supplied the Russians with tidbits of CIA secrets, or “chickenfeed,” that had been approved by his
superiors at the CIA. What his CIA superiors did not fully take into account in this spy versus
spy game was the SVR’s ability to manipulate, compromise, and convert a “dangle” to its own
ends. As it turned out, Russian intelligence had been assembling a psychological profile on
Nicholson since the late 1980s, and found vulnerability: his resentment at the failure of his
superiors to recognize his achievements in intelligence. It played on this vulnerability to
compromise him and then converted him to becoming its mole inside the CIA. He worked for the
SVR first in Asia then at the CIA headquarters at Langley, where he was given a management
position. Among other secret documents, he provided the SVR with the identities of CIA officers
sent to the CIA’s special training school at Fort Peary, Virginia, which opened up the door for the
SVR to make other potential recruitments. Meanwhile, it paid him $300,000 before he was finally
arrested by the FBI in November 1996. (After his conviction for espionage, he was sentenced to
23 years in Federal prison.) The CIA post mortem on Nicholson, who was the highest-ranking
CIA officer ever recruited (as far as is known), made clear that even a loyal American, with no
intention of betraying the United States, could be entrapped in the spy game.

This leads Aquinas to develop his
theology of marriage as a way of
consolidating and stabilizing parental
commitment, especially paternal
commitment, to their dependent
children. *°

Although neither Aristotle nor
Aquinas presented the full
intergenerational scope of Cacioppo’s
interpretation of kin altruism and
inclusive fitness — that it must extend to
our children’s children and not just our
own — both perspectives comprehended
the interlocking nature of kin altruism
and the well-spring of care, long-term
human commitment, and hence some of
the rudimentary energies of human
morality.

Of course, Aquinas and those
who followed him supplemented these
naturalistic observations with additional
epistemological presuppositions that
may seem strange to scientists. These
included the idea that God works
through nature as well as grace, hence
God is present in the kin altruistic
inclinations of parents and grandparents.
He also assumed that in order for kin
altruism to be stable, the additional
social reinforcements of institutional
marriage and God’s strengthening grace
and forgiveness were also needed. In
addition, he held - and Christianity has
always taught - that Christian love
includes more than kin altruism and the
care of our familial offspring; it must
include the love of neighbor, stranger,
and enemy, even to the point of self-
sacrifice. For the Christian, this was
made possible by the idea that God was
the creator of all humans and hence each
person was a child of God and made in
God’s image (imago dei). For this
reason, as Kant would say on different
grounds, each individual should be

Page |37

treated “always as an end and never as a
means only.” °° In Aquinas’s view,
acting on this belief, and with the
empowering grace of God, made it
possible for Christians to build on yet
analogically generalize their kin
altruism to all children of God, even
those beyond the immediate family, their
own children, and their own kin. These
wider assumptions may be beyond the
competence of science to assess. They
entail a step toward metaphysical
speculation of the kind science would do
better to avoid. Nonetheless, in the view
of Christian love developed in Aquinas,
the seeds of a religious humanism — in
this case a Christian humanism —began
to form.

I have tried to illustrate how
insights from Aristotle and Aquinas can
join with insights from evolutionary
psychology and social neuroscience to
refine the Christian understanding of
love. In pursuing this course, I join the
work of Stephen Pope and others in
presenting this option. ”” The kind of
Christian humanism found in Aquinas
makes it possible for Christianity to be
enriched by the modern sciences of
human nature. Aquinas’s view is
strikingly different from Nygren’s
representation of Paul and Luther when
Nygren contends that Christian love does
not build on our own natural energies,
but “has come to us from heaven.”** Or
again, it is very different from Nygren’s
view when he writes that the Christian is
“merely the tube, the channel through
which God’s love flows.”” The
complete discontinuity in this statement
between the downward love of God and
the natural extension to nonkin of human
kin-altruistic impulses is stunning. And
such a view as Nygren’s precludes the
possibility of a religious humanism of
the kind I have been describing. And it

The Prince, a paedophile
and the sex slave teen

Sharon Churcher and Chelsea White, DailyTelegraph
February 28, 2011 6:00am

A MOTHER of three living in Australia has revealed she was a teenage prostitute flown all over the world
by a convicted sex offender to meet Prince Andrew.

The revelations have rocked Buckingham Palace as the woman, Virginia Roberts, 27, confessed

she was the minor identified in FBI and subsequent civil proceedings against wealthy financier

and registered sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

A photo of Epstein and the Duke of York, Prince Andrew, together last week compelled Ms
Roberts to come forward.

First employed as a 15-year-old as Epstein's masseuse, she alleges he groomed her to become a
prostitute, paying her for sex with him and his influential friends.

While Ms Roberts said there was never any sexual relationship between the Prince and herself,
she claims that as a 17-year-old she met the Prince on three occasions - at one of which she was
told to sit on his knee while he touched another woman's breast.

Pictures: Prince Andrew and Virginia Roberts
Latest from Mail on Sunday

Ms Roberts told London newspaper The Mail on Sunday she was first flown to England on a
private jet to meet the Prince in March 2001.

The 17-year-old was told to dance with the Prince and even posed for a photograph.
For her time with Epstein and the Prince on that trip, Epstein paid her $US15,000.

When she next met the Prince in the US, a 21-year-old woman who was working for Epstein
was sitting on Prince Andrew's knee. Ms Roberts said she was instructed to do the same while
the Prince touched the older woman's breast as a joke.

and his “lie-detecting” donkey. Lore has
it that the Sultan was missing a valuable
vase from his estate and suspected that
one of his servants had stolen the piece.
To identify the culprit, the Sultan
gathered his servants in front of a dark
room in which a donkey was tied, and
then asked each of his servants if they
had stolen the item. Each said “no”. The
Sultan explained that inside the room
was a magical donkey, specially trained
to detect liars, who would bray when
slapped by someone who had lied. The
servants were sent into the room, one by
one, and were instructed to close the
door, slap the donkey and return. “When
the donkey brays,” the Sultan
proclaimed, “I will have my culprit”.
The first servant was sent into the room
and returned shortly thereafter--
tremendously relieved as the donkey had
not brayed. One by one, the remaining
servants entered the room and returned.
The donkey had not brayed and all the
servants looked quite relaxed. The
Sultan was sanguine -- he knew this
donkey never brayed under any
circumstances. The Sultan asked the
servants to show him their hands. He
then pointed to one of them and declared
“we have our thief,” instructing the
guards to take him away. How had he
identified the culprit? Rather than
relying on a magical donkey, the Sultan,
who recall was a student of psychology,
took a more rational approach.
Understanding the impact of beliefs on
behavior, the Sultan had surreptitiously
infiltrated powdered charcoal into the
donkey’s hair. When the servants
slapped the donkey, the charcoal marked
their hands—with the exception of the
guilty servant who had not slapped the
donkey, out of a belief and associated
fear that the donkey could detect a liar!

Power of Beliefs

Beliefs may be potent
determinants of behavior, but can they
kill? And if so, how? How can these
invisible, intangible entities impact
health? In a now classic article published
in the American Anthropologist in 1942,
Walter Cannon, a leading Harvard
physiologist and expert on the
autonomic nervous system, proposed an
answer (1). Investigating phenomena
such as voodoo practices of the Haitians
and “bone-pointing” among Australian
aborigines, Cannon found a common
feature among the victims of such rituals
was a strong belief in the curse and an
associated morbid fear of the outcome.
That fear, he argued, could trigger a
“fight-or-flight reaction” (a phrase he
had earlier coined), characterized by
powerful and exaggerated activation of
the sympathetic nervous system. The
resulting vascular constriction
diminishes blood flow to critical tissues
(i.e., ischemia), with consequent hypoxia
(decreased oxygen) and disturbances in
normal metabolism and cellular
function. These reactions may be
exacerbated by the lack of food and
water as the victim “pines away.”
Cannon argued that these reactions could
become life-threatening—fulfilling the
gruesome legacy of the ritual—based on
a belief in the supernatural, the veracity
of which is largely irrelevant. More
relevant is the emotion triggered by the
belief, specious as it may be.

Beliefs and emotions have
consequences, both behavioral and
physiological. A recent example comes
from the contemporary medical
literature. There is now a well-
documented condition, sometimes
triggered by something as innocuous as a
spousal argument or a surprise birthday
party, which entails the hallmark clinical

Jane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts - so not a new individual. The allegations made by Victoria
Roberts against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. The original allegations are not new and have
been fully responded to and shown to be untrue.

Each time the story is re told it changes with new salacious details about public figures and
world leaders and now it is alleged by Ms Roberts that Alan Derschowitz is involved in having
sexual relations with her, which he denies.

Ms Roberts claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and not publicised as news, as
they are defamatory.

Ghislaine Maxwell's original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains the same.
Maxwell strongly denies allegations of an unsavoury nature, which have appeared in the British
press and elsewhere and reserves her right to seek redress at the repetition of such old

defamatory claims.

messages which would allow it to trace the path of messages that passed through them. Through
this technology, it could tag and follow TOR users as their communications travelled across the
Internet. It could even borrow their Internet identities. To be sure, the NSA also had such a
capability. The Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht discovered to his distress that his TOR software
did not make his computer server in Iceland invisible. According to a former top official in the
Justice Department, the NSA was able to locate it by cracking the TOR software, (Ulbricht is
currently serving a life prison sentence for his Silk Road activities.). Unlike adversary services,
however, the NSA needs a warrant to investigate US citizens who use TOR.

Even the NSA is not immune from an attack of its own computers. CIA deputy director
Morell, who served on the committee evaluating the NSA’s vulnerability in the Snowden affair
after retiring from the CIA in 2013, wrote in his 2015 book “The Great War of our Times,” that
many financial institutions have “better cyber security than the NSA.” If nothing else, the
Internet helped make the activities of US intelligence workers visible to the SVR.

Even if the SVR theoretically had opportunities, it still had to find at least one disgruntled
civilian contractor inside in the NSA who had access to the sealed-off computer networks. Did it
find its man? If so, was it before or after Snowden arrived in Hong Kong with the Level 3 NSA
files?

background, and sayeret experience. But I was still gaining brigade command
experience. And I couldn’t help feeling the role was intended as a kind of rest-
and-recovery cure because of my illness, not too different from the reason Uzi
had been given the job. Still, I did need rest and recovery. Even if fully healthy,
I’m not sure I could have convinced Motta to change his mind. In my weakened
state, I had no chance.

Skeptical though I was about the job, it opened up a new world to me. The
kirya itself was not new territory. But now, I became exposed to how how the
huge range of intelligence information we gathered was collated, evaluated,
assessed and ultimately applied. Helping with this process was my new
assignment. There were, in fact, two of us. We were both colonels and together
we provided the intelligence background for military operations. I had the post
on inside the military intelligence department. My opposite number was in the
operations department — the more senior role, in a way, because he had a more
direct link to the people actually doing the operations. He was a friend from
officers’ school: Dovik Tamari’s younger brother, Shai. Once a week, Shai and
I put together an assessment report. Then, we’d join Motta’s operations meeting
with the general staff, often attended by the man who’d followed Dayan as
defense minister, Shimon Peres.

The analysis of military intelligence included separate teams for Egypt and
Syria, Jordan and Lebanon, Iraq and other neighboring states, as well as other
countries and superpower relations. It relied on all our raw intelligence material,
from both military intelligence and Mossad, as well as academic and specialist
literature. Each desk dealt not just with military issues, but political and
economic developments. I was responsible, along with Shai and a few others,
for bringing all this together. This meant frequent meetings with members of the
analysis teams. For the first six months or so, I barely uttered a word in these
sessions. I listened, not just absorbing the information but getting to understand
the way the analysts worked and thought.

Our whole intelligence department was responsible for drafting an annual
strategic assessment for the army and the government. The final report was
written by Shlomo Gazit, who had succeeded Eli Zeira as head of military
intelligence. Before we sent it to print, he held a long meeting, inviting the
views of all the military intelligence officers. The focus in 1976, just three years
after the war, was on the risks of a new surprise attack. At the end of the
discussion, however, he said: ““We know we run a real danger for the country if

Integrity

Foreign funding can undermine the independence of American institutions, and various
types of coercive and covert activities by China (and other countries) directly contradict
core democratic values and freedoms, which must be protected by institutional vigilance
and effective governance.

e¢ Openness and freedom are fundamental elements of American democracy and
intrinsic strengths of the United States and its way of life. These values must be
protected against corrosive actions by China and other countries.

e Various institutions—but notably universities and think tanks—need to
enhance sharing and pooling of information concerning Chinese activities,
and they should promote more closely coordinated collective action to counter
China’s inappropriate activities and pressures. This report recommends that
American institutions within each of the above two sectors (and possibly others)
formulate and agree to a “Code of Conduct” to guide their exchanges with Chinese
counterparts.

e When they believe that efforts to exert influence have violated US laws or
the rights of American citizens and foreign residents in the United States, US
institutions should refer such activities to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.

e Rigorous efforts should be undertaken to inform the Chinese American community
about potentially inappropriate activities carried out by China. At the same time,
utmost efforts must be taken to protect the rights of the Chinese American
community, as well as protecting the rights of Chinese citizens living or studying in
the United States.

e Consideration should be given to establishing a federal government office that
American state and local governments and nongovernmental institutions could
approach—on a strictly voluntary basis—for advice on how best to manage Chinese
requests for engagement and partnership. This office could also provide confidential
background on the affiliations of Chinese individuals and organizations to party and
State institutions.

recession), annual revenue growth (3%) has been roughly in line with GDP growth, but
corporate income taxes have grown 2% a year. Social insurance taxes grew 5% annually and
represented 37% of USA Inc. revenue, compared with 19% in 1965. An expert might ask:

o What level of social insurance or entitlement taxes can USA Inc. support without reducing
job creation?

o Are low corporate income taxes important to global competitive advantage and stimulating
growth?

* Entitlement spending has risen 5% a year on average since 1965, well above average annual
GDP growth of 3%, and now absorbs 51% of all expenses, more than twice its share in 1965.
Defense and non-defense discretionary spending (including infrastructure, education, and law
enforcement) is up just 1-2% annually over that period. Questions for shareholders:

o Do USA Inc.’s operations run at maximum efficiency? Where are the opportunities for cost
savings?

o Should all expense categories be benchmarked against GDP growth? Should some grow
faster or slower than GDP? If so, what are the key determinants?

o Would greater investment in infrastructure, education, and global competitiveness yield
more long-term security for the elderly and disadvantaged?

With expenses outstripping revenues by a large (and growing) margin, a turnaround expert
would develop an analytical framework for readjusting USA Inc.’s business model and strategic
plans. Prudence would dictate that our expert assume below-trend GDP growth and above-trend
unemployment, plus rising interest rates — all of which would make the base case operating
scenario fairly gloomy.

This analysis can’t ignore our dependence on entitlements. Almost one-third of all
Americans have grown up in an environment of lean savings and heavy reliance on
government healthcare subsidies. It’s not just a question of numbers — it’s a question of
our responsibilities as citizens...and what kind of society we want to be.

Some 90 million Americans (out of a total population of 307 million) have grown accustomed to
support from entitlement programs; so, too, have 14 million workers in the healthcare industry
who, directly or indirectly, benefit from government subsidies via Medicare and Medicaid. Low
personal savings and high unemployment make radical change difficult. Political will can be
difficult to summon, especially during election campaigns.

designed by Enrique Zozaya in a sleek, modern-tropical style and
capture the unspoiled views on private terraces and balconies. With the
soaring Sierra Madre del Sur mountains in the distance and sleepy
fishing village of Barra de Potosi close by, the Hotel Las Palmas is a
true barefoot hideaway in a quintessentially Mexican setting.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030204.txt,"having the grand jury actually name the specific indictable crimes for which there was clear
evidence of guilt was important: “This fundamental conclusion [of criminal guilt] should not
be allowed to be lost in a recitation of facts or sources of evidence that omits the basic
judgment involved or leaves it open to public (and Congressional) speculation and debate.”

The memo also noted that the president could be named an unindicted co-conspirator in the
indictment of the other conspirators, the course ultimately chosen by Jaworski.

4. The June 21, 1974, Reply Brief for the United States in US v. Nixon. The U.S. District
Court for the District of Columbia refused Nixon’s motion to expunge his inclusion as an
unindicted co-conspirator in the Watergate indictment. Nixon asked the Supreme Court to
reverse that decision. His lawyers argued that since a sitting president could not be indicted,
neither should he be implicated as an unindicted co-conspirator.

In this filing on behalf of the United States, Jaworski rejected Nixon’s premise that a
president could not be indicted, stating that “It is an open and substantial question whether
an incumbent President is subject to indictment.” The brief argues for indictability before
concluding that it is unnecessary to decide that question in order to resolve whether to permit
his inclusion as an unindicted co-conspirator.

(Despite the filing’s origin in Jaworski’s office, it would be a mistake to argue that this filing
was not in some sense the position of the Department of Justice. Leon Jaworski and his
attorneys were officers of the Department of Justice assigned by the attorney general the
responsibility for advancing the legal positions of the United States, including in
representations to the U.S. Supreme Court.)

The Jaworski filing notes how critical it is to identify the president as one of the criminal
accused: “the identification of each co-conspirator — regardless of station — is a
prerequisite to making his declarations in furtherance of the conspiracy admissible against
the other conspirators.”

Although the brief concludes that “it is by no means clear that a President is immune from
indictment” during his term, the special prosecutor chose not to indict the sitting president
on the basis of “practical arguments.” Those arguments, however,

cannot fairly be stretched to confer immunity on the President from being identified as an
unindicted co-conspirator, when it is necessary to do so in connection with criminal
proceedings against persons unquestionably liable to indictment.

Naming the president as an unindicted co-conspirator was necessary for the grand jury to
return a “true bill,” Jaworski argued, and “required here to outline the full range of the
alleged conspiracy.” There exists, moreover, “a legitimate public purpose in reporting the
fact that serious criminal charges against a government official have been made.”

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027853.txt,"The challenge now, I told my exhausted team, was to make sure we were
prepared for this new reality. Part of the spadework was already in place. Much
as I’d hoped that Arafat and I could turn a new page in Middle East history, I
had directed our army chief-of-staff, nine months before the summit, to draw up
contingency plans for the likelihood of an unprecedentedly deadly eruption of
Palestinian violence if we were to fail.

Now, I felt we had to go even further, and to prepare a proactive alternative
to the negotiated deal we’d been unable to secure. I proposed considering a
unilateral Israeli pullout from the West Bank and Gaza. The territorial terms
would, necessarily, be less far-reaching than the proposal Arafat had rejected.
But I felt we should still withdraw from the great majority of the land we had
captured in 1967, still leaving the Palestinians an area which the outside world
would recognize as wholly sufficient for them to establish a viable, successful
state.

And crucially, this would finally give Israel, our country, a delineated, final
border with the territory captured in the Six-Day War.

Gili, clearly uneasy about accepting the idea that the chances for a negotiated
peace were definitively gone, left to try to get some sleep on the long flight
ahead. Danny and Shlomo Ben-Ami as well. Within an hour or so, the plane
was full of irregularly slumped bodies, the silence broken only by the drone of
the 707’s engines and the occasional sound of snoring.

I sat, wide awake, in one of the seats at the front.

My sleeping habits were another inheritance from Sayveret Matkal. During
those years, nearly everything of significance which I did had happened after
sundown. The commando operations were, of course, set for darkness whenever
possible. The element of surprise could mean the difference between success
and failure, indeed life and death. But all of my planning, all my thinking,
tended to happen at night as well. The quiet, and the lack of distractions, helped
to discipline my mind. I found that it helped to free my mind as well, sometimes
only to discover that it went off in unexpected directions.

It did so now. Perhaps even I was still reluctant to accept that Camp David
meant that the opportunity for a transformative deal with Arafat was finished.
Yet whatever the reason, I began thinking back to the first time that my path and
his had crossed. It was in the spring of 1968, nearly a year after Israel had
defeated the armies of our three main Arab enemies — Egypt, Syria and Jordan.
Israeli forces were advancing on a Jordanian town called Karameh, across the

If you have a character trait, say, honesty, you have had to come
to grips over the years with its upside and its downside. People ap-
preciate you for being honest, but not when they ask you if they look
good after they have spent an hour dressing (I speak from experience
here). People dislike dishonesty but not when it helps get a deal closed
because you said you loved a restaurant that you really hated. We have
mixed feelings about honesty, as we do about any personality charac-
teristic. We like friendly people but we dislike overly friendly people.
Who decides which is which is anybody’s guess. Teenagers often try
to be all things to all people, but as adults they soon realize that they
simply will have to be themselves and they will try to find work and
friends that suit the personalities that they happen to have.

Personality features are not conscious. We don’t decide which
ones to have and we may not even be aware of how others perceive
us. We do what we feel comfortable doing and we push on. And then
we meet integrity and compliance officers.

They tell us to read every detail of a contract to make sure we are
in compliance, and those who are detail-oriented and fearful of mak-
ing errors and introverted and sensitive do it without question, and
those people who are gregarious and confident and aggressive figure
they can get by without it. What is an integrity and compliance officer
to do?

Here is what not to do:

e Don’t try to tell people who naturally act one way to act
differently.

e Don’t make a movie of the idiot who did it wrong and
say, See, look how dumb that guy was and look what
trouble he got into.

e Don’t lecture on the benefits of behaving the way the
company wants you to behave.

e Don’t write a manual with correct behavior that no one
will read.

e Don’t build an e-learning course with multiple choice
answers where one of them is the right thing to do.

The mind is organized around experiences. We remember our experi-

ences and we index our remembered experiences so that we can find
them later. Individuals don’t know how they do this, but cognitive

on Tuesday. The Town recommends administrative costs in the amount of
$150.00 and a fine of $250.00 a day to start on June 19, 2008 if compliance is not
achieved by tomorrow.

Mr. Ballentine asked for clarification on the motion and was advised by Mr.
Randolph that it would be a finding of non-compliance of Chapter 10, Section 10-
6, administrative costs of $150.00 and a compliance date of July 18, 2008 with a
fine to be considered at the next meeting if compliance was not achieved.

Ms. Duemler said she believed that the dog, besides being a nuisance, is a threat to
society and she hoped that by Tuesday the dog did not break loose from Dr. Lynn
and maul some child, that she believed it is a disgrace and she supports the Town.

(applause from the audience)

MOTION BY MR. FRIED TO FIND DR. LYNN IN VIOLATION OF
CHAPTER 10, SECTION 10-6, ASSESS ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN
THE AMOUNT OF $150.00 AND REQUIRE HIM TO COME INTO
COMPLIANCE BY JULY 18, 2008

MOTION SECONDED BY MR. BALLENTINE

MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY

Mr. Randolph asked if a motion could be made to defer the consideration of
violation of Chapter 10, Section 10-45 (i) until the August 21, 2008 meeting and
Ms. Greenberg advised she would make that motion. Mr. Fried asked Mr.
Randolph if he would explain the reason for this. Mr. Randolph said the argument
had been made that 10-45 should not apply because the dog has already been
deemed dangerous by the County and pursuant to the Town’s Code. Mr.
Randolph said he believed the argument was going to be made in court on Tuesday
that it is not appropriate for the Town to move forward with regard to 10-45 (i)
because that only applies to any incident that occurs after the dog has been
declared dangerous. The argument has been made that Dr. Lynn has done
everything he is required to do. Mr. Randolph said he hesitated to explain further
if the matter was going to be deferred. Mr. Randolph said the position of Staff is
that item (i) stands on its own merits, that it is not connected to 10-45 (a) through
(h). It is also the position of Staff that it is appropriate to bring a violation of (i) to
the Code Enforcement Board even though it does not specifically state that in 10-
45 because Section 2-439, which is the citation fine schedule, sets forth all of the
sections of the Code of Ordinances which can be brought before the Code
Enforcement Board and 10-45 is listed. Code Enforcement has the right to bring a
violation directly to the Code Enforcement Board instead of issuing the fine set
forth in the fine schedule. Mr. Randolph said the Board could move forward in
considering 10-45 instead of deferring it to the next meeting.

Mr. Fried commented that based on the egregious nature of what they had been
presented with, he believed the Board should do everything they could to put

7717

Cite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)

of action for trespass under New York law
pursuant to concerted action theory.

86. Damages €757.14, 57.27

In New York, a plaintiff may establish
negligent infliction of emotional distress
under the bystander or direct duty theory.

87. Damages €°57.27

Under the bystander theory for prov-
ing negligent infliction of emotional dis-
tress under New York law, a defendant’s
conduct is negligent as creating an unrea-
sonable risk of bodily harm to a plaintiff,
and such conduct is a substantial factor in
bringing about injuries to the plaintiff in
consequence of shock or fright resulting
from his or her contemporaneous observa-
tion of serious physical injury or death
inflicted by the defendant’s conduct on a
member of the plaintiff's immediate family
in his or her presence.

88. Damages €-57.14

Under the direct duty theory for
proving negligent infliction of emotional
distress under New York law, a plaintiff
suffers emotional distress caused by defen-
dant’s breach of a duty which unreason-
ably endangered the plaintiff's own physi-
cal safety.

89. Negligence ¢=202

To establish a claim for negligence
under New York law, a plaintiff must show
that the defendant owed the plaintiff a
cognizable duty of care, that the defendant
breached that duty, and that the plaintiff
suffered damages as a proximate cause of
that breach.

90. Negligence <=210

The most basic element of a negli-
gence claim under New York law is the
existence of a duty owed to plaintiffs by
defendants.

91. Banks and Banking <-100

Under New York negligence law,
banks do not owe non-customers a duty to
protect them from the intentional torts of
their customers.

92. Damages €757.18

Negligence <=210

Survivors of victims of September 11,
2001 attacks failed to state causes of action
in complaint against alleged supporters of
terrorists for negligence and negligent in-
fliction of emotional distress, inasmuch as
they failed to allege or identify duty owed
to them by defendants.

93. War and National Emergency <=50

In light of extreme nature of charge of
terrorism, fairness required extra-careful
scrutiny of allegations by survivors of vic-
tims of September 11, 2001 attacks as to
any particular defendant, to ensure that
he, or it, had fair notice of claims, includ-
ing claims under Antiterrorism Act (ATA).
18 U.S.C.A. § 2331 et seq.

94. Banks and Banking ¢=226

Allegations in complaint by survivors
of victims of September 11, 2001 attacks,
that Saudi Arabian bank aided and abetted
terrorists by donating to charities and act-
ing as bank for charities, failed to state
cause of action under Antiterrorism Act
(ATA) against bank, in that survivors of-
fered no facts to support conclusion that
bank knew of charities’ alleged support for
terrorism, and failed to allege relationship
between Hamas, with which bank allegedly
had ties, and September 11 terrorists. 18
U.S.C.A. § 2331 et seq.

95. Conspiracy 1.1

Torts 21

Under New York law, concerted ac-
tion liability, pursuant to a conspiracy or
aiding and abetting theory, requires gener-
al knowledge of the primary actor’s con-
duct.

° In your hotel room, you seemed in no rush to leave. You ordered a cheese plate, and later champagne,
despite her suggestion that you go down to dinner.

° You then made a comment about her eye makeup, getting very close to her face.

° You then lifted her by her arms, and pushed her onto the bed beneath you, forcibly kissing her and
trying to pull down the crotch of her tights.

° She struggled to push you off her.

° You said, “When | was in college | could never get a girl that looked like you.”

° When you pulled out a condom, she got out from under you. She said “I have to go,” and rushed out of
the room.

Incident 2:

° In an incident that occurred in fall of 2007 while you were a physics professor at Case Western Reserve

University, a student tried to talk to you about her plans after graduation. You mentioned to her how tough it
must be to have all the other physics majors asking her out on dates.

° In a second incident in December of 2007, while you were still at Case Western, the same student
visited your office to interview you for a student science journal. You closed the door behind her, and ignored
the questions she had prepared. Then you made a casual comment about taking her out for dinner.

° Later, in a regular column for the school paper, she described her experiences with you, without
mentioning you by name. “There was even one particular creep of a professor who once told me he thought
differently of me compared to other students and asked me to dinner: a situation so disturbing that it left me
upset for weeks afterward,” she wrote.

° She was then approached by a dean at the university, who suspected that she was referring to you,
based on a previously reported incident with another student. He encouraged her to make a complaint, and
she did.

° University investigators interviewed both you and the student.

° On September 4, 2008, Susan Nickel-Schindewolf, the university’s associate vice president for student
affairs, wrote to the student, telling her that the investigation was complete. She wrote that you had been told:
“This type of behavior could constitute sexual harassment in violation of the university’s sexual harassment
policy.”

° The letter also stated that you were prohibited from making contact with the student as long as she
remained at Case.

° The letter also stated that you are required to get approval from the dean or the chair of the physics
department before setting foot on the campus again.

° The letter also stated, “Dr. Krauss expressed regret about having a negative impact on you, and also
his willingness to use this complaint as an opportunity to reflect and improve on his future interactions with
students.”

° By then, you had already left Case, taking up your current position at Arizona State University the
month before.

° “The opportunities being offered at ASU are simply too great to turn down at this stage in my career,”
you told Case colleagues, in an email announcing your departure on April 16, 2008.

Incident 3:

° A former Case Western physics department administrator confirmed that she had reported a previous

incident involving a student who had confided in her about your inappropriate behavior towards her.

alleged that USIS employees often “flushed,” or ended cases before completing a full
investigation, to meet corporate-imposed quotas for getting bonuses. One employee said in an
email cited in the government’s complaint “Flushed everything like a dead goldfish.” As a result,
some of information specialists entering the NSA through the back door of outside contractors
were not fully vetted. (On August 20, 2015 USIS agreed to forfeit $30 million in fees to settle
the law suit.)

USIS was also opened to sophisticated hacking attacks by outsiders. For example, in August
2014, the Department of Homeland Security’s counterintelligence unit discovered such a massive
and persistent breach in USIS that it shut down its entire exchange of data with USIS. The
intrusion into USIS records in this case was attributed to hackers in China most likely linked to
the Chinese intelligence service. Such massive intrusions dated back to 2011. USIS’ lack of
security in its website left a gaping hole through which outside parties, including Chinese and
Russian hackers, could learn both the identity and background of information specialists applying
for jobs at the NSA.

These private companies had one further security weakness. They did sufficiently protect the
personal data of their off-premise employees working at the NSA. Consider, for example, the
successful 2011 attack on the Booz Allen Hamilton servers. The previously-mentioned hackers'
group “Anonymous” took credit for it. It not only breached the security of Booz Allen servers
but cracked the algorithms it used to protect its employees. It next injected so-called Trojan-
horse viruses and other malicious codes on Booz Allen servers that allowed it to have future
entry. Presumably, if amateur hackers such as Anonymous could break into the computers of the
NSA’s largest contractor, so could the state espionage services with far more advanced hacking
tools such as those of Russia and China. From these sites, an adversary intelligence service
could obtain all the job applications and personal resumes submitted to contractors such as Booz
Allen. It could then compile a list of the candidates looking to work at the NSA.

These deficiencies in the private sector were compounded by the failure of security in the
government’s own Office of Personnel Management. It used a computer system called E-QIP in
which intelligence employees with security clearances, including outside contractors, updated
their computerized records to maintain or upgrade their security clearances. For example,
Snowden updated his clearance in 2011. To do so, these employees constantly updated their
financial and personal information. As it turned out, there was a major hole in the E-QIP system.
It was repeatedly hacked since 2010 by unknown parties. In 2015, the US government told
Congress that China was most likely responsible but Russia and other nations with sophisticated
cyber services could have also participated in the hacking. In any case, the records of over 19
million employees, including intelligence workers, became available to a hostile intelligence
service. This breach would allow hostile services a great deal of information about independent
contractors working at the NSA. They could then use this data to follow the movements of
movement of any of these intelligence workers they deemed of interest.

orientation, BDSM remains surrounded by stigma, scandal and occasional legal action.
This presentation covers the basics of BDSM (however, it's not a how-to lecture -- you
aren't going to learn how to use a whip, though you'll learn where to go to find out!). I
prefer to poll the audience to see what they want to cover on top of that -- BDSM history?
cultural landmarks? BDSM & feminism? legal issues? I've got it all! I have given this
lecture more than any other. It can be squished into an hour, but I prefer two hours.

* Sex-Positivity for Everyone! Including the Mens! What is masculinity or male
advocacy as a movement, and how is it in dialogue with contemporary feminism? Can it
be incorporated into feminism, or can the values of the sex-positive feminist community
speak to its concerns? What does positive, productive talk about masculinity sound like? I
talk about all this in a short lecturette and then facilitate small discussions on kinky male
sexuality, men in the pickup artist community, and men who buy sex. This workshop was
originally requested by the University of Chicago, and based on feedback from that
experience and others, I have been adapting it. It should take about 90 minutes.

* The Sex+++ Film Series at Jane Addams Hull-House Museum and related film
screenings. I have now overseen many many screenings of sex-positive documentaries,
and facilitated followup discussions afterwards. In the past I have done this primarily to
accomplish my own activist educational goals or to raise funds for deserving institutions,
but I'd be happy to run a screening or two upon request. Please note, however, that I don't
own the rights to all the films I've screened, and so if you want me to run a screening for
you, you may need to budget extra in order to cover the rights. I started the Sex+++ Film
Series at Chicago's Jane Addams Hull-House Museum, and as I write this in 2012, the
film series is in its fourth year. You can look at the film series calendar here:

I would certainly be willing to design a new workshop or lecture upon request -- in fact,
two of the above events were created at the request of the institutions that invited me.

Dear Jeffrey: 
Trust all is well. We are in full pre-production of our Radical Breakthroughs series/season for Closer To 
Truth. We expect to have a complete production plan, with contributors, locations and schedule, by mid/late 
November - when (coincidentally) I will be back in NY. 
My next email will add detail, including first (rough) outlines of the first two episodes. I'll be copying the 
producer/director of Closer To Truth, as I will from now on with all reports/communications related to the 
content of the series. Whenever we want to communicate privately, about the series/grant or anything else, 
please use a separate email (or respond to this one). 
I am in Santa Monica for two weeks, then Beijing for the big Party Congress. I may need to stay until after 
Trump's (supposed) visit. Attached are my two recent BBC commentaries on China (N.Korea bomb and 
Myanmar refugees). 
Always available to Skype. 
I am truly excited about the series - nothing like it, could have impact - and I deeply appreciate your 
generosity/support, confidence and trust. 
Take care and warm regards,

there are many, many measures, particularly about getting the banks on better footing,
making them address all the liquid assets they have. I think you need a real clean-up of the
banks balance sheets.

In addition, I think you really need to go back and make banks do what they do:
Commercial banks lend money, and investment banks invest in entrepreneurs and to get
away from this trading — you know, the hedge fund securitization, which they’ve all
become basically trading operations and securitizations and not put capital back and really
grow businesses and to grow the economy. So I think it’s a whole area that just — and I
will tell you, the underpinning of this populist revolt is the financial crisis of 2008. That
revolt, the way that it was dealt with, the way that the people who ran the banks and ran
the hedge funds have never really been held accountable for what they did, has fueled
much of the anger in the tea party movement in the United States.

Questioner: Thank you.

Bannon: Great question.

Questioner: Hello, Mr. Bannon. I’m Mario Fantini, a Vermonter living in Vienna,
Austria. You began describing some of the trends you're seeing worldwide, very dangerous
trends, worry trends. Another movement that I’ve been seeing grow and spread in Europe,
unfortunately, is what can only be described as tribalist or neo-nativist movement — they
call themselves Identitarians. These are mostly young, working-class, populist groups, and
they’re teaching self-defense classes, but also they are arguing against — and quite
effectively, I might add — against capitalism and global financial institutions, ete. How do
we counteract this stuff? Because they’re appealing to a lot of young people at a very
visceral level, especially with the ethnic and racial stuff.

Bannon: I didn’t hear the whole question, about the tribalist?

“One of the committees in Congress said to the Justice Department, 35 [bank] executives,
I believe, that they should have criminal indictments against — not one of those has ever
been followed up on.”

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012813.txt,"someone else’s subjective experience to guide our chosen experiences.

Orgasms and eating are two of the great pleasures in life, whether you live in Tokyo, Toronto,
Toulouse, Tehran or Timbuktu? I doubt any healthy human adult would debate this. What can be debated
is what counts as the ultimate orgasm or food experience. It can be debated both among friends and
inside our own minds, influenced by personal experience and our knowledge of what else is available, or
might be.

Consider potato chips. As a snack, potato chips generate a revenue in the United States of about
$6-7 billion dollars each year, relying on the slicing and frying of about 2 billion pounds of potatoes.
These facts make clear that most Americans love potato chips, and are motivated to consume them. Like
other salty snacks, it is hard to eat just one. The American psychologist Carey Morewedge and his
collaborators ran an experiment to find out how much people love potato chips, and whether their
anticipated fondness for this delicious crisp changes in the face of other options. Subjects sat at a table in
front of a bowl of potato chips and an alternative food that was visible, but out of reach. The alternative
was either a highly undesirable snack such as sardines, or a highly desirable one such as Godiva
chocolate. After subjects contemplated what it would be like to eat each of these foods, they then rated
how much they would enjoy them. This is like the study I described in the pleasure section where subjects
rated how much they would enjoy different vacation destinations, but without the comparison between
one clearly good and one clearly bad spot. Both focus on the anticipation of a pleasurable experience.

Subjects’ ratings of potato chip deliciousness soared when sardines were on offer, and plummeted
in the presence of chocolate. Context matters. What is clearly delicious when there is nothing else on the
table, loses or gains in deliciousness when the table fills up with other delectable or disgusting
alternatives.

What’s happening to our pleasure detector, and especially our anticipated reward system, in the
potato chip experiment? Are we incapable of understanding what makes us happy, unable to figure out
what is or is not delicious, or are we fickle? What Morewedge’s experiment reveals is that deliciousness,
like ugliness, stubbornness, and obsequiousness, is a judgment, judgments are always relative or
comparative, and as such, based on some standard that is either present in the moment, stored away in
our memories, or anticipated in the future. When Estelle Reiner uttered her famous line, she was using
Meg Ryan’s orgasmic expression of delight as a comparative metric. When we compare food items or
wine or pretty faces or sporty cars, we recruit our brain’s resources, especially the circuitry involved in
attention, emotion and memory. Whether we say that potato chips are the best snack, or better than
sardines, we have made a comparison that requires our attention, our capacity to keep at least two items in
memory, and a way of emotionally tagging each of the items. This comparison-shopping taxes our

mental resources, recruiting them away from the job of evaluating one snack, and leading to a distorted

tary, the hero of the 2016 Hollywood movie Snowden (directed by
Oliver Stone), and a consultant to the 2015 season of the televi-
sion series Homeland. He would be nominated for the Nobel Peace
Prize in 2014. He would attract over one million followers to his
tweets in 2015. “For me, in terms of personal satisfaction, the mis-
sion’s already accomplished. I already won,” he informed the Post
in his first live interview in Moscow in December 2013. It was a
mission that involved a very high-stakes enterprise: taking not only
domestic surveillance documents but America’s military and foreign
intelligence secrets abroad.

Whistle-blowers do not ordinarily steal military secrets. Nor do
they flee to the territory of America’s principal adversaries. A fugi-
tive, especially one lacking a Russian visa, does not wind up in Mos-
cow by pure accident. It’s hard to imagine that a Russian president
with the KGB background of Putin would give his personal sanction
for a high-profile exfiltration from Hong Kong without weighing
the gain that might proceed from it. Whatever else may be said of
Putin, his actions show him to be a calculating opportunist. Part of

© his calculus would be that the defector from American intelligence ©
had taken possession of a great number of potentially valuable docu-
ments from the inner sanctum of the NSA and, aside from these
documents, claimed to hold secrets of great importance in his head.
To be sure, the practical value of this stolen archive would require
a lengthy evaluation by Russia’s other intelligence services. But it
is hard to believe that a defector who put himself in the hands of
the FSB, the successor to the KGB, and other Russian intelligence
services wouldn't be expected to cooperate with them. Even if such
a defector did not carry these files with him to Moscow, intelligence
services have the means to recover digital files, even after they are
erased from a computer or if they are sent to the cloud. Moreover,
once secret documents are taken, they are compromised. Yet for
much of the American public, Snowden remained a hero.

going on at the moment in the States.

Bannon: Outside of Fox News and the Drudge Report, we’re the third-largest
conservative news site and, quite frankly, we have a bigger global reach than even Fox.
And that’s why we’re expanding so much internationally.

Look, we believe — strongly — that there is a global tea party movement. We've seen that.
We were the first group to get in and start reporting on things like UKIP and Front
National and other center right. With all the baggage that those groups bring — and trust
me, a lot of them bring a lot of baggage, both ethnically and racially — but we think that
will all be worked through with time.

The central thing that binds that all together is a center-right populist movement of really
the middle class, the working men and women in the world who are just tired of being
dictated to by what we call the party of Davos. A group of kind of — we’re not conspiracy-
theory guys, but there’s certainly — and I could see this when I worked at Goldman Sachs
— there are people in New York that feel closer to people in London and in Berlin than
they do to people in Kansas and in Colorado, and they have more of this elite mentality
that they’re going to dictate to everybody how the world’s going to be run.

I will tell you that the working men and women of Europe and Asia and the United States
and Latin America don’t believe that. They believe they know what’s best for how they will
comport their lives. They think they know best about how to raise their families and how
to educate their families. So I think you're seeing a global reaction to centralized
government, whether that government is in Beijing or that government is in Washington,

DC, or that government is in Brussels. So we are the platform for the voice of that.

“Putin’s ... very, very very intelligent. I can see this in the United States where he’s
playing very strongly to social conservatives about his message about more traditional
values, so I think it’s something that we have to be very much on guard of.”

Now, with that, we are strong capitalists. And we believe in the benefits of capitalism. And,
particularly, the harder-nosed the capitalism, the better. However, like I said, there’s two

strands of capitalism that we’re quite concerned about.

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029027
"
IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012807.txt,"that the parasitic enemy shouldn’t be exterminated. This is where scientific explanation gains
considerable interest, helping us understand how we develop anticipatory pleasures and past-oriented
regrets, struggle to change from habitual rewards, and acquire irrational desires for experiences we no
longer enjoy — a problem that appears to maintain most forms of addiction.

Humans go to restaurants and bees to flowers because both are associated with food. Within these
broad categories, there are good restaurants and flowers, as well as bad ones, where good and bad are
determined by experience. The experience can be direct, as when food 1s actually consumed, or indirect
as when humans listen to an animated friend describe a restaurant’s menu and bees watch a hive mate
dance, providing a description of the flower’s location and quality. Once the association between food
and location is established, simply seeing the restaurant or flower triggers a cascade of neural and
chemical activity in the brain linked to reward and the anticipation of pleasure. The restaurant and
flower are cues that predict food. If you walked into your favorite restaurant and found that they sold
fertilizer rather than food, you would be heartbroken. If you haven’t been to the restaurant in a long time,
but memorialized your previous experience as a gastronomic high, you will be deeply disappointed if
your first bite doesn’t live up to the standards you anticipated. This mismatch between anticipated and
experienced reward will lead to a cascade of brain activity — indicative of an error. The primary engine
driving the experience of reward, including predicting when it will occur and with what kind of intensity,
is the dopaminergic system, a network of brain areas that releases dopamine in most invertebrates and
vertebrates, including the human vertebrate.

Many natural behaviors trigger dopamine, including male songbirds singing to attract females,
rhesus monkeys seeing a red light that has been associated with a soon to be delivered shot of juice, and
humans cooperating with each other. Many unnatural behaviors and objects can also trigger dopamine.
Animals trained to press a switch for food, will often become obsessively attracted to the switch,
caressing and biting it even in the absence of food; humans with addictions to cigarettes, food and
gambling, will often obsessively fondle an empty cigarette carton, fork, and deck of cards, respectively.
But these correlations leave open the question of whether dopamine causes the anticipation or experience
of reward, or flows from these experiences.

To tackle the causality problem requires experiments, either directly changing dopamine
concentration or comparing individuals who, due to genetic differences, show differences in dopamine
levels. We know from studies of rodents and monkeys that selectively increasing dopamine with drugs
results in heightened wanting of food if there are cues to foraging, or sex if opportunity knocks. The
Israelian cognitive neuroscientist Tali Sharot pursued a similar approach with healthy humans subjects.
She first asked individuals to rate how happy they would be if they vacationed in 80 possible destinations.

Then, some subjects took a placebo while others took L-dopa, a drug that selectively increases the release

As recently as Friday, the U.S. and Antigua were still talking about settlement options, Nkenge
Harmon, a spokeswoman for the U.S. government, told me in an email. And, she wrote:

...lf Antigua does proceed with the unprecedented plan for its government to authorize the theft
of intellectual property, it would only serve to hurt Antigua's own interests. Government-
authorized piracy would undermine chances for a settlement. It also would serve as a major
impediment to foreign investment in the Antiguan economy, particularly in high-tech industries.

COLLABORATIVE INSIGHTS February 25, 2019

Epidiolex appeared to be well tolerated in the trial. 94% of patients on 20 mg/kg
Epdiolex and 84% of patients on 10 mg/kg Epidiolex had an adverse event, compared to
72% of placebo patients. 88% of 20 mg/kg patients and 89% of 10 mg/kg patients
deemed their adverse events to be mild or moderate. The most common AEs on 20
mg/kg were somnolence, decreased appetite, diarrhea, upper respiratory infection,
pyrexia, vomiting and nasopharyngitis. For L1Omg/kg the most common AEs were
somnolence, decreased appetite, upper respiratory infection, diarrhea, and status
epilepticus. None of the cases of status epilepticus on 10 mg/kg were deemed
treatment-related. Thirteen patients on 20 mg/kg Epidiolex had an SAE, of which five
were considered treatment related; and 13 patients on 10 mg/kg Epidiolex had an SAE,
of which 2 were considered treatment related, compared to 8 patients on placebo.
Elevations in ALT/AST levels were observed in 11 patients in the 20mg/kg group and 2
patients in the 1Omg/kg group; 10 of the 13 patients were also on valproic acid. Five
Epidiolex patients withdrew due to the elevations, but none of the patients met the
criteria for drug-induced liver injury. GW noted that overall 10 mg/kg seemed to be
somewhat better tolerated; 6 patients on 20 mg/kg Epidiolex and 1 patient on 10
mg/kg Epidiolex discontinued treatment due to adverse events, compared with 1
patient on placebo. There were no deaths in the trial. The results of the trial were
published in NEJM in May 2018.

Following the release of Phase III datasets from 1 Dravet and 2 LGS trials, a key area of
controversy among investors (though not physicians) had been the drug-drug
interaction between Epidiolex and clobazam, and in particular whether Epidiolex was
effective in patients who were not also taking clobazam. This was put to rest at AES
2017 when GW presented a pooled analysis of the two Phase Ill LGS trials evaluating
Epidiolex’s efficacy with and without concomitant clobazam. Even without clobazam,
Epidiolex produced solid placebo-adjusted response rates. Response was characterized
in terms of “25% responders”, “50% responders”, and “75% responders”, meaning the
proportion of patients who had a 25%, 50%, or 75% decrease in seizure frequency. For
patients randomized to Epidiolex’s 20mg/kg dose, the placebo-adjusted 50% response
rate was 22% for patients on Epidiolex without clobazam, compared to 33% for patients
on Epidiolex and clobazam. We believe that investors had been hoping for a 12-15%
placebo-adjusted 50% response rate for patients on Epidiolex without clobazam in order
to be satisfied that Epidiolex was active without clobazam, and therefore the results
cleared this bar. For patients randomized to 10 mg/kg Epidiolex, the placebo-adjusted
50% response rate was 25% for patients on Epidiolex without clobazam, compared to
27% for patients on Epidiolex with clobazam. The results for other thresholds of seizure
frequency reduction were also generally solid. For 25% responders, the placebo-
adjusted response rate was 9% for patients on 20 mg/kg Epidiolex without clobazam,
compared to 24% for patients on 20mg/kg Epidiolex with clobazam. At the 75%
responder threshold, the placebo adjusted response rate was 8% for patients on
20me/kg Epidiolex without clobazam, compared to 30% for patients on 20mg/kg
Epidiolex with clobazam. In addition to the pooled Phase III data, there were also
abstracts from the compassionate use experience of Massachusetts General Hospital
and the University of Alabama Birmingham. The analyses from these two institutions
also concluded that Epidiolex does not need to be combined with clobazam to be
effective.

transfer across domains but not that much. (Learning to buy an air-
plane ticket is somewhat related to eating in a restaurant, but not that
closely. You might use a credit card in each, for example, and might be
refused service because you are rude.)

2. Modeling: Building a conscious model of a process

We need to learn how things work. A citizen knows, presumably,
how voting works. Someone looking for venture capital should know
how fund raising works. Processes need to be learned in order to ef-
fectively participate in them and in order to propose changes in them.
Building a conscious model of a process matters a great deal if you
want to make the process work for you. If you want to get into col-
lege, you need to understand how the process works. This cannot be
learned from experience in a serious way because one may do it only
once and may not be able to experience the entire process. Having
the process explained to you may not work that well either because
this will not bring an operational understanding of it (as opposed to
a more superficial understanding of it). Designing it, modifying it,
and participating in simulations of it work much better as learning
methods.

3. Experimentation: Experimentation and replanning based on
success and failure

This is probably the most important learning process we engage
in while living our lives. We make life decisions and we need to know
when we need to change something. There are big decisions—like
getting married or how to raise a child or whether to change jobs—
and little decisions, such as changing your diet or your sleep habits.
We make our decisions on the basis of what has worked before and
what has failed to work. We tend to make life decisions without much
knowledge. We don’t know how our bodies work all that well and we
don’t really know how the world works or what it has in store for us.
Thinking about these issues and learning from failure is a pressing
need all through life. Learning to analyze what has worked out and
what has not and why is part of living a rational life. These things can
be learned by living and talking about our experiences, thus creating a
database of stories that we can rely on later. We learn by talking with

thing in a multi-family dwelling and it should be egregious.

MOTION BY MR. OCHSTEIN TO GRANT AN EXTENSION OF TIME
UNTIL AUGUST 8, 2008 TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE AND TO
ASSESS A FINE OF $250.00, RETROACTIVE TO JULY 17, 2008 IF
COMPLIANCE WAS NOT ACHIEVED

SECONDED BY MS. GREENBERG

MOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY

VIII. Fine Reduction:

A. Case # 08-2301, 167 E. Inlet Drive, The Landfall Group,
Violation of Chapter 18, Section 18-242, Subsection 104.5.1.6, medium projects,
all new or remodel construction projects 4000 sq. ft, to 8,999 sq. ft. under roof be
allowed 22 months

Lead Code Enforcement Officer Walton said in October, 2007, Ajax Equity LLC
was found in violation of going over the construction time limits. On November
15, 2008 they still were not in compliance and a daily fine of $250.00 started
running. The final inspection was obtained in March, 2008. The fine ran for 137
days prior to compliance being achieved and the accumulated fine due is $34,
250.00 and the have $150.00 hearing costs have not been paid.

Frank Lynch advised he was the attorney for both The Landfall Group and

Ajax. He said when they appeared before the Board in October, Lazslo Wagner,

the principal of The Landfall Group, who has built homes throughout the Town of
Palm Beach for 26 years acknowledged that he was unaware of this particular

Code provision. Had he been, they would have applied for an extension of time to

complete the construction. At the hearing, Mr. Koeppel made a motion to allow

them an additional sixty (60) days to complete the construction, find them in non-
compliance and assess the $150 fee. After a significant amount of discussion, that

motion went to a vote and failed 4-3. A second motion was made and Ms.

Duemler thought the $250.00 fee was significant and she believed the fine should

be $125.00 a day. Mr. Lynch gave Mr. Walton a copy of that transcript to put in

the record. As part of their request, they are asking the Board to consider what

Ms. Duemler suggested at the meeting. At the same time, Mr. Lynch said he would

like them to consider that The Landfall Group is a good corporate citizen and

Cite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)

(1) whether the foreign state created
the entity for a national purpose; (2)
whether the foreign state actively super-
vises the entity; (3) whether the foreign
state requires the hiring of public em-
ployees and pays their salaries; (4)
whether the entity holds exclusive rights
to some right in the [foreign] country;
and (5) how the entity is treated under
foreign state law.

Id. at 217 (citing Kelly v. Syria Shell
Petroleum Dev. B.V., 213 F.3d 841, 846-47
(th Cir.2000) (alteration in  original)).
The Second Circuit held that the KDIC
was an organ of Korea because it was
formed by statute and presidential decree;
it performs the governmental functions of
protecting depositors and promoting finan-
cial stability; its directors are appointed
by the Ministry of Finance and Economy;
its president is appointed by the President
of the Republic of Korea; and many of its
operations are overseen by the Ministry of
Finance and Economy. I[d.

The banks argued that once the court
determined KDIC was an organ of the
foreign state, the banks automatically be-
came instrumentalities or agencies of the
state because KDIC owned a majority of
their stock. Id. The Second Circuit reject-
ed this argument, finding such a holding
would “permit an infinite number of sub-
sidiaries to enjoy sovereign immunity, ...
would be incompatible with the purpose of
the FSIA, which is to grant governmental,
not private corporate immunity, and ...
would reflect infidelity to the Supreme
Court’s reasoning in Dole Food.” Id. at
218. Accordingly, it reiterated that “‘a
subsidiary of an instrumentality is not it-
self entitled to instrumentality status’ ...
and that ‘only direct ownership of a major-
ity of shares by the foreign state satisfies
the statutory requirement.” Jd. (quoting
Dole Food, 5388 U.S. at 473-74, 123 S.Ct.
1655).

The Second Circuit determined the
KDIC was an organ of Korea by consider-
ing whether it was created and supervised
by a foreign state and whether public em-
ployees were performing public functions.
Id. at 217. Under its reasoning, it would
appear the PIF is also an organ. It was
created by royal decree, it is supervised by
the Kingdom’s Council of Ministers and
staffed with government employees. See
PIF Charter.

Yet, under the “legal characteristics”
test, the PIF could qualify as a political
subdivision. See Hyatt, 945 F.Supp. at
680. In Hyatt, a court in this district
reasoned that a statutory requirement of
an agency or instrumentality, as opposed
to a political subdivision, is that it is a
“separate legal person ... that can func-
tion independent of the state.” Jd. at 684.
If an entity could sue and be sued, own
property, and contract in its own name, it
would be considered an agency or instru-
mentality and not a political subdivision.
Id. at 685. NCB submits the PIF sues
and is sued as, and generally holds proper-
ty on behalf of, the Ministry of Finance.
Al-Wohaibi Aff. 199, 12.

NCB argues the Court should employ
the “core functions” test outlined in Tran-
saero, Inc. v. La Fuerza Aerea Boliviana,
30 F.3d 148 (D.C.Cir.1994), to find that the
PIF is the equivalent of the Kingdom.
Under this test, if the entity’s core func-
tions are governmental, it is considered
the state itself. Jd. at 153. If its functions
are commercial in nature, it is considered
an instrumentality. /d. This Court is gov-
erned by Second Circuit precedent and
finds Filler and Hyatt to be controlling.
Even if it were to adopt Transaero, howev-
er, the Court finds on the record before it
that the PIF’s emphasis on commercial
projects precludes a finding that its core
functions are governmental in nature. See
PIF Charter 12 (noting the PIF’s primary

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 022696 
Carlo Allegri / Reuters 
Over roughly the past month, coverage of Bill Clinton's travels with financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have made 
their way from a thick stack of court documents into something approaching political mythology, propelled by a string of 
innuendo-laced reports hinting that the former president must have been in some way complicit when he voyaged with a 
billionaire known for preying on underage girls. 
It's a story with plenty to gape at, from horrific and excruciatingly detailed allegations against Epstein to the frequent presence of 
a former president who was, after all, nearly chased from office for a (consensual) affair with an intern. 
But sometimes stories that seem too good to be true —just might be. A detailed review by a team of BuzzFeed News reporters of 
more than 2,000 pages of pleadings, depositions, affidavits, police reports, flight logs, and other documents filed in state and 
federal court found that many of the most provocative allegations about Clinton have little to no factual foundation and are 
exaggerated at best; that the documents — which appear to be the source for nearly all current reporting on this subject — 
themselves never suggest that Clinton was doing more than using his wealthy friend as a kind of global taxi service; and that 
many of the most lurid insinuations have been floated without any visible support from verifiable information. 
While it's still possible that some Rosetta stone of Clintonian depravity will surface from a pair of ongoing lawsuits involving 
Epstein, the fact that nothing even close to that has been dug up over the course of a half-dozen years of heated litigation should 
not be encouraging for Republican operatives and other Clinton critics hotly anticipating the very worst. 
One sign that the connection is a bit weak: The lawyers who have used the Clinton link to help publicize their cases have been 
markedly vague on details. 
When asked to present actual proof, Jack Scarola, the Florida attorney responsible for filing some of the most attention-grabbing 
documents that have come to light in recent weeks, warned darkly in an email of extortionate threats, power, wealth or political 
pressure. 
The time will come when all your questions will be answered, said Scarola, who represents another trial attorney suing Epstein in 
Palm Beach County Court. But that time is not now. 
Unwilling to wait, perhaps, publications on both sides of the Atlantic have gleefully dipped into those documents to publish 
of Epstein's black book, which contains a host of Clinton phone numbers (along with just about every 
other powerful figure in the Western world); dissections of handwritten flight logs for the financier's private 727 aircraft that 
frequently capture Bubba at 30,000 feet; and extensive allegations from a woman, Virginia Roberts, who claims she was Epstein's 
sex slave as a teenager and whose recollection places the former commander-in-chief on Orgy Island in 2002 to participate in a 
sexual romp, possibly with women who were not yet of age. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 022697 
YORK & 'ORGY ISLAND,' SAYS TEEN SEX SLAVE 
View this image 
National Enquirer 
Tellingly, many of those articles — which have notably increased in tempo in recent weeks following Roberts' late December 
accusation that noted attorney Alan Dershowitz was one of the men she was forced to have sex with — contain language 
underscoring the fact that none of this proves anything. It should at this stage be stressed that the Mail has no evidence to 
corroborate this and other claims made by Virginia Roberts, the Daily Mailwrote in April. Though her LinkedIn page claims a 
certificate in Swedish massage, there is no evidence that she ever actually treated Epstein to one, Gawker (in the 
straightforward and clearest reporting on the documents to date) wrote last week. And the National Enquirer did not appear to 
rely on the court record for its conclusions, instead to the interpretation of an unnamed source who noted that Bill's name is all 
over the legal papers, which are chock-full of sordid claims. 
Clinton's discretion on matters of sexual restraint has attained permanent notoriety, so maybe it's natural to assume that particular 
leopard doesn't change his spots. But at this point, there is simply nothing to back those sordid claims up. 
Here's what we do know: 
Jeffrey Epstein is a secretive billionaire financier and Democratic donor who says he never attended college but whose 
background is in physics. He owns properties in New York, Florida, New Mexico, London, and Paris and also owns an island in 
the U.S. Virgin Islands. He has at least two private jets, including the 727. 
He has known Bill Clinton since about 1995, and his relationship with him grew stronger after he left office. There is no question 
they were friendly. Epstein's so-called black book, which is less like something out of the Heidi Fleiss affair and more what most 
people would call a phone directory, contains 21 numbers for getting in touch with Clinton, as well as emails and addresses. 
But that 92-page directory also contains exactly the range of eye-poppingly famous and powerful contacts one might expect of an 
incredibly rich, connected person who owns Manhattan's largest private residence, from Tony Blair to Elie Wiesel to Courtney 
Love. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 022698 
Epstein was long rumored to be a sexual libertine; It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, real estate 
personality Donald Trump once said of his old friend. And many of them are on the younger side.

Palm Beach County Court 
Epstein, in his Florida sex offender photo; at right, a phone message to Epstein from a modeling agent offering Russian lessons 
from a 2x8 year old girl. 
In 2006, that reputation caught up with him, when he was arrested by the Palm Beach Police on charges of sexually molesting 
numerous underage girls. Police reports in the court record show that detectives found Epstein regularly paid very young women 
to give him massages that he turned into sexual encounters. He allegedly had a preference for very young women, whom he 
carefully groomed into increasingly extreme situations, including what some, including Roberts, allege to be sexual slavery. 
In total, 40 women were identified as possible victims of sexual abuse by Epstein, many of them teenagers at the time, including 
some younger than 14 years old. Epstein was originally charged with a variety of crimes, including sexual assault, rape, and 
witness tampering. 
He avoided most of those charges as well as federal prosecution in late 2007 by agreeing to plead guilty in Florida court, a deal 
that Dershowitz, who was one of Epstein's lawyers, helped negotiate along with an all-star legal lineup that interestingly also 
included famed Clinton-hunter Ken Starr. 
In the end, Epstein got 18 months in prison for a single count of soliciting an underage prostitute, of which he served 13 months. 
He is now a registered sex offender who lists his primary residence as the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
In a pleading late last month in federal court, attorneys for Roberts allege that Dershowitz helped negotiate an agreement with a 
provision that provided protection for himself against criminal prosecution. Dershowitz has denied these charges vigorously, 
calling them salacious and false and, possibly more importantly, completely irrelevant in a Jan. 12 filing. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 022700 
Despite what some called among the most exhaustive investigations in Palm Beach Police history — which dug up such evidence 
as an Amazon receipt for Epstein's purchase of titles including Training With Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Exotic Slaves and 
Their Owners — there is nothing in the police record suggesting any other men were involved in Epstein's predatory behavior.

The criminal case provoked numerous lawsuits from women alleging they were victims of Epstein's proclivities, followed by 
with more than two dozen of them. One firm bringing some of those cases employed a young lawyer named Bradley 
Edwards, who managed some of the cases. In 2009, a founding partner at the firm, Scott Rothstein, fled the country before 
ultimately returning to plead guilty of running a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme built around recruiting investors to buy stakes in 
litigation settlements that turned out to be phony. 
As details of the fraud emerged, Epstein sued Rothstein and Edwards in Palm Beach County Court for racketeering, alleging, 
among other things, that they dangled Bill Clinton's association with Epstein as a lure to investors, implying that settlements would 
be fast and sizable. Epstein ultimately dropped his suit in 2012, but by that time, Edwards had countersued for malicious 
prosecution and abuse of process. 
, along with a claim by Virginia Roberts against the federal government over the 2007 prosecution deal in district court 
(which she filed as a Jane Doe in 2008), are still pending and are the source of most of the scant information about Clinton that 
has appeared. Scarola, who in the past sued Chiquit over payments to violent leftist Colombian rebels and won a $1.45 billion 
verdict over Morgan Stanley (that was later overturned), is the lawyer bringing the suit in county court in West Palm Beach, while 
Paul Cassell, a former federal judge known for his critical take on mandatory-minimum sentences, mans the federal case four 
blocks away. 
Neither Cassell nor Edwards responded to requests for comment. 
It is primarily from pleadings in those cases that the press has been getting a glimpse inside the lifestyle of Epstein, and, by 
extension, Clinton. Edwards had sound legal basis for believing former President Clinton had relevant and discoverable 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 022701 
information, part of one pleading reads. Roberts, in her case, alleges that Epstein forced her to be sexually exploited by 
Defendant's adult male peers, including royalty, politicians, academicians, businessmen, and/or other professional and personal 
acquaintances, which, Edwards elsewhere claims, are categories Clinton and acquaintances of Clinton fall into. 
Police reports entered into the record go into stomach-wrenching detail about Epstein's alleged exploits with the girls and women 
he recruited and paid for massages that became sexual acts, and mention other women participating as well. Epstein's longtime 
friend, the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, is accused of taking part, while his personal assistant, Sarah Kellen, is described procuring 
young woman for him. 
But neither of those women has ever said a word about Clinton being involved. Maxwell, for her part, has never been deposed. 
She canceled a deposition in 2010, claiming she had to return to England indefinitely due to family illness, but was soon thereafter 
photographed by Us Weekly at Chelsea Clinton's wedding in Rhinebeck, New York.

For her part, Kellen, who won immunity from prosecution along with Epstein in 2007, did sit for a deposition, but repeatedly 
pleaded the Fifth, refusing to even say if she'd ever even met the former president. 
Epstein's much-discussed flight logs show fairly conclusively that she has. 
A review of the handwritten documents shows Clinton taking 13 trips in Epstein's specially outfitted Boeing 727, including a much-
discussed trip to Africa with Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker. In every single instance, the logs show, Kellen was also on the plane, 
as was Epstein. That may sound suspicious, except for the fact that Kellen has been described as Epstein's right hand, profoundly 
involved in his professional activities as well as personal ones. Indeed, Doug Band, Clinton's personal aide, was on all but one of 
the flights the former president took on Epstein's jet.

Among the other people who most frequently flew with Clinton are Maxwell and Adriana Ross (formerly Adriana Mucinska), 
another Epstein assistant and a former model. The logs also show him flying with former advisor Ira Magaziner, ex-Transportation 
Secretary Rodney Slater, and fashion model Naomi Campbell. 
The pilots' documents also leave numerous and — understandably — intriguing questions unanswered: Clinton was on four flights 
with women identified as only Janice and Jessica, who have not been identified; he once flew with a person identified only as 
one female and also, during part of the trip throughout Africa, a young woman named Chauntae Davies, who appears in 
Epstein's phone directly under the massage category and whose expertise in Swedish massage was described in Gawkey's story 
mentioning her last week. And because the entries are hand-written in a very cramped log form, it's impossible to know if 
important names ended up illegible or left out altogether, nor if there are other logs that have not been revealed. 
But based on what's in the court files, there are no further clues about those flights, other than the testimony and public 
statements of Roberts, who has described the airplane as a kind of high-altitude Gomorrah. What is on the record is a deposition 
of Larry Visoski, one of Epstein's former pilots, who recalls having Clinton on his plane as many as 20 times. When asked, Do you 
remember him being on the airplane with younger girls? Visoski replies, simply, No. 
Clinton flew literally around the world with Epstein, traveling from New York to London, to Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, 
Morocco, Portugal, Russia, and throughout Africa. In almost every case, according to cross-referenced information on his speaking 
engagements, Clinton was apparently traveling for professional reasons, and, according to the logs, he never flew with his wealthy 
friend anywhere near the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
That does little to bolster statements by Roberts, who in a 2011 conversation with her lawyers (which both New York Posts Page 
Sixand Radar Online described as an interview) claimed Clinton traveled to Epstein's infamous retreat on Little St. James Island 
in 2002. 
Earlier this month, it was reported that Roberts is writing a tell-all memoir about her experiences. In a sworn affidavit filed in 
court last week, she claimed to have had sex with Epstein, Dershowitz, England's Prince Andrew, and several other men on 
numerous occasions, and portrayed a three-year period ending in 2002 when Epstein passed her off to his friends continually. But, 
she added, I have never had sexual relations with Clinton, nor have I claimed to have had such relations.

Intensive coverage prompted by the court filings has hinted that Clinton abruptly ceased his flying with Epstein in 2005, not 
terribly long before he was arrested, perhaps because of events related to Epstein's sexual abuse of children. The implication is 
that Clinton may have known trouble of the worst kind was coming and decided to get out while he could. In fact, the logs show 
all of Clinton's flights came in 2002 and 2003, with not a single appearance aloft recorded in 2004 or 2005. 
The closest potential link to Clinton in the period closer to Epstein's fall, the public record suggests, comes from one of his 
longtime confidants, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. 
The flight logs indicate Summers flew on Epstein's jet as far back as 1998, but also on April 15, 2004, September 14, 2005, and 
December 21, 2005. The final trip came 10 days after Summers got married, and the log for the flight — from Bedford, 
Massachusetts, to the Virgin Islands — shows what appears to be his new bride on board, as well as Ghislaine Maxwell, but not 
Epstein.

Epstein was a significant donor to Harvard University, of which Summers was president at the time. According to a spokesperson 
for Summers, on a few occasions when Epstein was flying to where Summers was also traveling, he accepted rides on the 
billionaire's jet. 
Attorneys in the two cases have attempted to get the court to permit discovery from Clinton himself, but have been stymied by 
motions from Epstein's lawyers. Court records show they have also tried unsuccessfully to depose Donald Trump, former New 
Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, former Sony Music head Tommy Mottola, and magician David Copperfield. Notably, a list of 73 
proposed witnesses in Roberts' trial does not include Clinton. 
The tale of Epstein and his sexual activities is undoubtedly a fascinating, and harrowing, one. But with the star witness in one case 
swearing under oath that she has no such evidence, and everyone else in a position to know keeping their mouths firmly shut, it is 
at this point extremely difficult to draw even a hazy, crooked, dotted line between Epstein's depredations, in the bedroom or aloft, 
and William Jefferson Clinton.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030210.txt,"The arrival of a new assistant to the president for national security affairs is an ideal opportunity to restore best practices
to the national security apparatus. To her credit, Susan Rice appears to be reaching out with this very much in mind. If
changes are made that better serve the president by forcing people to think through policy options in the context of
objectives and strategies, those changes should not reflect poorly on the stewardship of her predecessor. The president
gets precisely the national security system he mandates and deserves. He is, as JFK noted in the immediate wake of the
Bay of Pigs fiasco, the responsible officer of government.

In the end it is the president, and not the Blackberry or some other device, who will drive the direction and processes of
foreign policy and diplomacy. It is up to him to tell his national security advisor that he wants the interagency to stop
tweeting and start thinking; to tell him how he should be evaluating US national security objectives with respect to Syria
(for example) and strategy options aimed at accomplishing them. This kind of deliberative process will not require people
to wear powdered wigs and inscribe talking points on parchment with quill pens. It will not even oblige them to disconnect
electronically.

Perhaps the biggest obstacle to an orderly national security process that is deliberative is the sheer brainpower of the
people sitting atop the bureaucratic pyramid. Barack Obama and Susan Rice are among the very brightest people to
serve in the US government. They may think they can figure Syria out themselves, within a small circle of trusted political
advisers. They may think they can handle Syria without reaching beyond their own national security staff, without probing
deeply into the Departments of State, Defense, the intelligence community, and elsewhere where additional expertise
resides. They will outsmart themselves if that is the approach they choose.

Blackberry diplomacy is a choice, not a device decision and certainly not a fact of life. Even in this day and age, it is
possible to figure out what one wants and how to go about getting it: even in government work.

                    Chief Deputy Whip
                    Diana DeGette


About Diana DeGette
Chief Deputy Whip Diana DeGette is a 8th term member of Congress, representing Colorado’s 1st Congressional district. In her eight terms serving the Denver metro region, Diana has established herself as a leader for progressive change on health care, reproductive rights, food safety, consumer protection and the environment. 


DeGette is the most senior legislator in Colorado’s House delegation, and in the 111th Congress she held a large amount of power as the House Democratic chief deputy whip and the vice chair of the influential House Energy and Commerce Committee. 

With the Republicans taking control of the House in 2010, DeGette lost her vice chair position, but she is still a chief deputy whip and the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee’s subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.

In January, 2011, Rep. DeGette was elected the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.

DeGette is best known for championing increased federal funding for stem-cell research. In 2006, the congresswoman pushed President George W. Bush to issue the very first veto of his presidency when she teamed up with then-Rep. Mike Castle (R-Del.) to pass the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act through a GOP-controlled Congress.

In summer 2008, DeGette published Sex, Science, and Stem Cells: Inside the Right Assault on Reason, a book that condemns the politicization of science and argues that legislation on issues like abortion, birth control and funding for education programs should be based on science rather than religion. Too many of our elected officials are simply incapable of thinking rationally about sex, she writes.

Diana is married to attorney Lino Lipinsky. They have two daughters and a dog.


Health care
Diana believes that it is critical that all Americans have access to the health care they need. Diana has led the way for health care reform in Congress and played a central role in expanding coverage for low-income children and families. 

Diana is a leading voice on health care reform in Congress. Her efforts were critical to the passage of a health reform bill earlier this year that will expand access to health care to millions of Americans and lower costs for those that previously enjoyed coverage. In particular, she was the leader of a broad coalition of representatives that were successful in resisting efforts to limit a woman’s right to choose under the new legislation. Diana’s top health care reform initiatives include access to high quality, affordable care for all children, prevention and wellness, strengthening the health care workforce, and expanding primary care and community health center services.
Diana has led efforts to expand the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), which provides health insurance to low-income children up to age 18. In the 111th Congress, Diana was a leader in the expansion of SCHIP that was signed into law by President Obama in February of 2009.


Stem Cell Research
U.S. Rep. DeGette was the chief architect of legislation to expand stem cell research, which was passed twice with broad, bipartisan support in Congress. The measure was vetoed twice by President George W. Bush – including his very first presidential veto. In March of 2009, President Barack Obama signed an executive order reversing former President Bush’s restrictions on embryonic stem cell research. Standing next to the President as he signed the order, U.S. Rep. DeGette is working with the Obama Administration on codifying the order into law. In March 2010, Diana introduced bipartisan stem cell research legislation that would do just that. The Stem Cell Research Advancement Act would ensure a lasting ethical framework overseeing stem cell research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and will provide stability to the scientists and individuals who are on the quest for live-saving cures.



Reproductive rights
As the co-chair of the Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus, Diana has fought for common-sense family planning and reproductive rights. She is a lead sponsor of the Prevention First agenda, which is a comprehensive, bi-partisan approach to reducing unintended pregnancies and the need for abortion. Most recently, Diana led the fight against the Stupak-Pitts Amendment – a dangerous restriction on women’s reproductive rights.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011608.txt,"from the SEALs in getting ashore, only one required direct co-ordination with
us. This was an attack on a DFLP building a mile or so away in southern Beirut,
led by Amnon Lipkin, the friend whose unit had faced one of the toughest
battles at Karameh. Amnon’s paratroop force would land with us and also pile
into Mossad rental cars. Our attacks would begin at the same time, with the
maximum prospect of retaining the advantage of surprise. When and if we both
completed the operations and got away safely, we would meet up again on the
seafront.

From our first meeting, the morning after Dado gave me the go-ahead, I
realized I would have to make at least one change to the plan to rely on the core
Sabena team. There was no way, after his exclusion from the hijack rescue
mission, that I could refuse Yoni when he pressed to be included. I added him to
Mookie Betzer’s force. I put the other two attack teams under a pair of young
officers named Amitai Nachmani and Zvika Gilad. Both were self-confident,
natural leaders. Both had other qualities I also knew we’d need: focus, and
calm. I would take charge on the street outside the targeted apartments, along
with Amiram Levin. With us would be Dov Bar, a Shayetet 13 officer, and our
medic, Shmuel Katz.

In the hangar at the sayeret base, we made mock-ups of the layout of the
apartments, using bedsheets for the walls and adjusting the dimensions as
further bits of intelligence came in from Mossad. But the real work involved
simulating the whole operation, from the moment of our landing on jet-black
rubber dinghies piloted by the SEALs. We found a new building development
in north Tel Aviv with a pair of apartment blocks under construction. For two
nights, we ran through the whole thing: setting off in the dinghies from a missile
boat off the Israeli coast before midnight, meeting up with our Mossad drivers
on shore, making our way through the center of Tel Aviv to the apartment
complexes and simulating the attack. I wanted to ensure we could pull off the
whole thing without anyone raising an alarm. The one problem came during the
second run-through. A policeman drove by as we were “attacking” the
apartments. Dado managed to convince him that reporting us to his superiors
would not be an especially good idea.

In our debriefing discussions after that exercise, Dado identified a major
problem I’d overlooked. We would be entering Beirut dressed as civilians. Once
we got to the top end of Rue Verdun, we planned to approach the apartments as
if we were party-goers returning from a night on the town. “It doesn’t look
right,” Dado said. “More than a dozen party people walking, all men?” Mookie

Cannabis Investment Report | December 2017

for the issuance of separate licenses for cultivation and processing. It also contemplates that permits will
be available under Colombia’s export laws for the export of lawful cannabis products to jurisdictions
where importation is legal. Colombia issued the first processing license in 2016 and the first cultivation
license in 2017.

In 2017, Argentina enacted regulations permitting the use of cannabis oil and other derivatives
either by qualifying patients or for scientific and medical research. Under the new legislation, the gov-
ernment will oversee cultivation and production of cannabis and its derivatives for research purposes
and for patient consumption, establish a national registry of qualifying patients and make cannabis
products available to those patients, free of charge. The government expects to import cannabis sup-
plies until they can be produced domestically.

Other Latin American nations that have taken recent steps to increase medical cannabis access
include Chile, Brazil, Mexico and Peru. In 2015, Chile changed its laws to allow medical cannabis use
by patients and to authorize the sale of cannabis-based medicines through pharmacies. In 2016, Brazil
approved. a resolution authorizing the prescription and importation of cannabis products, including
THC and CBD, for use in treating certain qualifying medical conditions. In June 2017, Mexico
enacted a law directing its Ministry of Health to prepare regulations for the research, production and
medicinal use of “pharmacological derivatives” of cannabis. In November 2017, Peru adopted a bill
legalizing the production, commercialization and importation of cannabis oil to be used for medical
purposes.

In the Caribbean region, Puerto Rico, the Cayman Islands and Jamaica have taken measures to
decriminalize cannabis or increase access for medical use. In 2015, the governor of Puerto Rico signed
an executive order that legalized use of cannabis derivatives (but not cannabis flower) for medical
purposes. Jamaica passed a law in 2015 that decriminalizes possession of small amounts of cannabis,
permits an individual to cultivate no more than five cannabis plants, establishes a medical cannabis
regulatory agency and allows tourists with foreign medical cannabis prescriptions to purchase small
amounts of cannabis. A 2016 law enacted in the Cayman Islands legalized the use of cannabis extracts
for medical purposes and authorized the creation of import regulations and the sale through licensed
pharmacies.

Australia and New Zealand

Australia amended its Narcotic Drugs Act in 2016 to authorize a regulated medical cannabis industry
in the country. The amendment establishes licenses to cultivate cannabis, produce cannabis resin and
other products for medicinal purposes, manufacture medicinal cannabis products and conduct canna-
bis research. A license-holder is required to secure a permit that places conditions on the license and
identifies specific activities allowed within the scope of the license. Cannabis products for medicinal
use that are either legally manufactured in Australia or legally imported can be prescribed to qualify-
ing medical patients. The amendment defines medicinal cannabis products broadly as a product that
includes, or is produced from, any part of the cannabis plant and is intended for the purpose of “cur-
ing, or alleviating the symptoms of a disease, ailment or injury.”

| Another suit alleges
sex during massage

By LARRY KELLER
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer
| WEST PALM BEACH
— Another woman filed a
federal lawsuit against Jef-
frey Epstein on Wednesday,
‘alleging that he turned a
massage she gave him at his
Palm Beach mansion into a
sexual episode when she was
16 years old.

Identified as “Jane Doe
No. 3,” she is seeking more
than $50 million, the same
as two other “Jane Does” who
filed similar lawsuits in the
past six weeks, All three suits
were filed by Miami lawyer
Jeffrey Herman. .

Herman subsequently
“withdrew the first Jane Doe’s.
lawsuit because of squabbling
by her parents over the litiga-
tion. The girl may refile the
suit after she turns 18 in May
and can make her own deci-
sions, Herman said.

Other alleged victims also
have contacted him, Herman
, ' said. “I do anticipate more

cases,” he:said.

In the latest litigation, Jane

Doe No. 3 alleges that she

was recruited by a former col-

lege student, Haley Robson,
to give Epstein a massage for
money at his waterfront home

late in 2004 or early in 2005.

The lawsuit alleges that,
while on the massage table,

Epstein sexually touched

Jane Doe No. 3, then mas-

turbated. She is suing on

grounds of sexual assault and
intentional infliction of emo-

tional distress.

“She felt intimidated. She
felt scared,” Herman said.
Jarie Doe No. 3-made only the
one visit to Epstein’s home,
he said.

“Its just another copycat
lawsuit filed by the same
lawyer who appears less
interested in the truth than
in grandstanding with these
press conferences,” said Jack
Goldberger, one of Epstein’s
attorneys. “We now have
sworn testimony that girls
lied about their age to Jeffrey
Epstein, and they were care-

ful in being convincing that.

they were over the age of 18.”
Herman said Robson
instructed Jane Doe No. 3,
“When he asks how old you
are, tell him 18 or 19 years
old.” But he said it doesn’t
matter. “They were underage
girls,” Herman said. “They
were sexually assaulted.”

In addition to the civil law-
suits, Epstein was indicted
on a single count of felony
solicitation of prostitution
in July 2006 after a lengthy
Palm Beach Police Depart-
ment investigation into his
activities with underage girls
at his home. A resolution has
been delayed continually. The
case is on Monday's court
docket but is expected to be

_ rescheduled once again.

“One of the reasons (Jane
Doe No. 3) came forward is
she is tired of waiting for jus-
tice,” Hérman said.

from existing investments for the foreseeable future.

The Fund Managers view this alignment of critical market factors as unprecedented. Each of
these factors individually has a direct impact on the level of risk and the potential for returns in
the healthcare technology sector. However, the positive trends in all of them occurring at the
same time should create a uniquely positive environment to execute NLV-II]’s targeted strategy
within the sector.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

New Leaf’s investment strategy is differentiated in the venture capital industry in terms of its
sector focus, specific approaches within each sector, and the depth of experience and long-term
track record that supports each element of the strategy. The Fund’s primary focus will be on
investments in the Biopharmaceutical and Information Convergence sectors, with a secondary
focus on Medical Devices and Biological Research Tools & Infrastructure. Investments will
be predominantly in the U.S., but could include a small number of investments in other parts of
the world (e.g., Western Europe or Canada). The focus within each sector will be the following:

Biopharmaceuticals: As in NLV-I and NLV-II, biopharmaceutical investments will be the core
focus for NLV-III and will comprise approximately 50% - 60% of the Fund. The Fund will
typically invest in development stage and commercial stage private companies and in publicly
traded small capitalization companies where the investments will be made mostly through
structured transactions. The portfolio will emphasize companies developing targeted
therapeutics that address molecular mechanisms of disease, where validated biomarkers can be
utilized to positively bias probabilities of success and reduce time and cost of development
compared to historical averages. These companies exemplify some of the key characteristics the
Fund Managers seek across the portfolio - namely large, unmet medical needs, strong science,
well differentiated technologies and high quality pre-clinical and clinical development
programs led by experienced management teams.

The Fund Managers believe that NLV-III will have the opportunity to invest in compelling
biopharmaceutical opportunities and that these will have attractive risk-return profiles for a
number of reasons, including the following:

e For the past decade, biopharmaceutical companies have been shifting their research and
development focus towards products that target mechanisms of disease at the molecular
level. Clinical programs for these types of products are typically smaller, more capital
efficient and have higher probabilities of success. These improvements are achievable
because precise biomarker testing enables a focus on only those patients where the
specific molecular mechanism is known to play an important role in the disease process.
By including only these patients in the clinical programs for these targeted products, the
probability of detecting critical efficacy signals is significantly increased, even with
relatively small numbers of patients;

e Targeted development programs are benefiting from an improving regulatory
environment, as the FDA is demonstrating clear interest in working constructively with

companies to bring these types of high-impact therapeutics to market more quickly and
efficiently. This spirit of cooperation was covered thoughtfully in a recent New England

UNITED KINGDOM

Unlike the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, the United Kingdom has had
no significant all-encompassing debate over Chinese influence operations. When
they have occurred, the debates tend to be confined to specific areas such as the
media, academia, or the economy. But so far, no one institute has attempted to bring
to light the full gamut of Chinese United Front and influence-peddling operations. As
such, Britain’s response to China’s attempts to insinuate itself within Britain’s critical
infrastructure, universities, civil society, political system, and think tanks has been
scattershot at best.

The United Kingdom has a complex political, economic, and historical relationship
with China, which is a significant trading partner and an increasingly significant
source of investment.' Especially since the official elevation of UK-China relations to
Golden Era status in 2014 and the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum, the United
Kingdom has become more open to Chinese influence.” Areas of vulnerability

to improper interference include political and civil society actors as well as the
media. Chinese firms are involved in strategic parts of the British economy, including
telecommunications and nuclear power. Improper interference activities can be difficult
to distinguish from acceptable influence via civil society exchange, public diplomacy,
and commerce. Problem cases include not only Chinese cyberattacks on political
organizations and think tanks but also willing collaboration and reluctant complicity.
A report by GPPi and Merics characterized the most important areas for Chinese

2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *903

The amendment seeks to protect the interests of the victim without unfair prejudice to the defense. It permits the defense to
seek judicial approval of the subpoena ex parte, because requiring the defendant to make and support the request in an
adversarial setting may force premature disclosure of defense strategy to the government. The court may approve or reject the
subpoena ex parte, or it may provide notice to the victim, who may then move to quash. In exercising its discretion, the court
should consider the relevance of the subpoenaed material to the defense, whether giving notice would prejudice the defense,
and the degree to which the subpoenaed material implicates the privacy and dignity interests of the victim. 774

Having seen the Advisory Committee proposal and accompanying note, I am concerned that the limits on subpoenas found in
the United States Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Nixon 734 might be vitiated by a broad rule. To ensure courts
consistently apply Nixon's substantive and procedural standards to victim-related subpoenas, I am modifying my earlier
proposal to require a court determination of specificity, relevance, and admissibility at trial, as well as notice to the victim, as
follows (new language italicized):

Rule 17(c)(3) - Subpoena for Personal or Confidential Information About Victim. After a complaint, indictment, or information
is filed, no record or document containing personal or confidential information about a victim may be subpoenaed without a
finding by the court that the information is specifically described, relevant to and admissible at trial, and that compliance
appears to be reasonable. If the court makes such a tentative finding, notice shall then be given to the victim, through the
attorney for the government or for the victim, before the subpoena is served. On motion made promptly by the victim, the court
may quash or modify the subpoena if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive and may ask the court to revisit any
tentative findings. A subpoena shall not be used for discovery purposes or to obtain information for impeachment at trial.

Discussion:

The issues involved in the Rule 17 amendments are complicated and very important. It is useful to divide the discussion into
three parts: (1) the problem the proposals address; (2) the procedural flaws in the Advisory Committee's proposal [*904]
allowing ex parte subpoenas; and (3) the general lack of authority for subpoenas seeking crime victim information.

(1) The Problem of Subpoenaing Confidential Victim Information

The existing rules governing subpoenas are flawed because they allow the parties to subpoena personal or confidential
information about a victim from third parties without the victim knowing. This issue was highlighted recently in the notorious
Utah state criminal proceedings involving the kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart. 7° Attorneys for Elizabeth's alleged kidnapper
subpoenaed class records from her high school (class and teacher lists, report cards, and disciplinary and attendance records)
and medical records from her hospital. 75° The school turned over the requested records without notice to the Smart family,
while the hospital refused to turn over the requested records. When Elizabeth's father learned that her school records had been
turned over to defense counsel, he filed a motion to have the records returned to the school. Prosecutors in the case also
objected that they were not given an opportunity to file a motion to quash prior to the production of the records. 737 The matter
is apparently still under review in the state courts.

The problem that occurred in the Smart case under the Utah state rules could occur under the federal rules, as the attorney for
Elizabeth Smart pointed out to the Advisory Committee in a letter. 73° The federal rules currently permit an objection from the

block and was a local hero. It was a shared tragedy and Moshe’s death—combined with my
mother’s reaction to it—had a profound and lasting effect on my 9 year old psyche.

My friends and I formed a “club’”—teally just a group of kids who played ball together. We
named it “The Palmach”—after the Israeli strike force that was helping to win the war. We
memorized the Palmach Anthem “Rishonin, Tamid Anachnu Tamid, Anu, Anu Hapalmach.” (
“We are always the first, we are the Palmach”). Recently, I spoke to a Jewish group in Los
Angeles and among the guests were Vidal Sassoon (the style master) and David Steinberg (the
comedian). Steinberg mentioned to me that when Sassoon was a young man, he had volunteered
to fight for the Palmach (If you think that seems unlikely, consider that “Dr. Ruth” Westheimer
served as a sniper in the same war). I challenged Sassoon to sing the Palmach Anthem and before
you knew it, Sassoon and I were loudly belting out the Hebrew words to the amusement of the
other surprised guests.

Israel declared statehood in May of 1948, when I was nine and a half years old. Following its
bold declaration that after 2,000 years of exile, there arose a Jewish state in the Land of Israel,
(supported by the United Nations, the United States, the Soviet Union and most western nations),
the nascent state was attacked by the armies of the surrounding Arab countries. That summer I
went to a Hebrew speaking Zionist summer camp called “Massad.” During my summer at Camp
Massad (where the counselor of an adjoining bunk was a young Noam Chomsky, then a fervent
left-wing Zionist) we heard daily announcements over the loudspeaker regarding the War of
Independence. We sang Israeli songs, danced the hora and played sports using Hebrew words (a
“strike” was a “Shkeya,” a “ball” a “kadur”.) The announcement I remember most vividly was
“Hatinok Rut met hayom’”—the “babe” Ruth died today. But I also remember several
announcements regarding the death or wounding of Israelis who were related to the people in the
camp. One out of every hundred Israeli men, women and children were killed—some in cold
blood, after surrendering—while defending their new state. Many of those killed had managed to
survive the Holocaust.

We also learned of Stalin’s campaign against Jewish writers, politicians and Zionists. After the
end of the war, Stalin became the new Hitler as we read about show trials, pogroms and
executions of Jews. We hated communism almost as much as we hated fascism.

These early memories—relating to the America’s war against Nazism, Israel’s War of
Independence, and Stalin’s war against the Jews—contributed significantly to my emerging
ideology and world views.

I grew up in a home with few books, little music, no art, no secular culture and no

intellectualism. My parents were smart but had no time or patience for these luxuries. Our
home was modest--the ground floor of a two and half family house. (The finished basement was
rented to my cousin and her new husband). Our apartment had two small bedrooms, the smaller
of which I shared with my brother. We ate in the kitchen. The living room, which had the
mandatory couch covered with a plastic protector, was reserved for special guests (who were
rare). The tiny bathroom was shared by the four of us. The foyer doubled as a dining area for
Friday night and Shabbat meals. The total area was certainly under __ square feet. But we had
an outside—and what an outside it was! In the front there was a small garden and a stoop. In the

attention or do not have enough time to react with better judgment (DeScioli
et al., 2011). Relative to the example of the tennis player with the allergy
described above, it is usually hard to distinguish between a competitor who does
not notice his opponent orders the dish with the allergen versus one who notices
but does not care. In contrast, transgressions of commission must be intended
almost by definition.

4. Suppose the witness knows an omission was intentional: In the above example,
the tennis player’s opponent’s allergy is widely known, and the witness saw the
player watch his opponent order the offending dish, had time to react, thought
about it, but did not to say anything. The witness suspects that others do not
know the competitor was aware his opponent ordered the dish, but believes the
tennis player should be condemned for purposely withholding information from
his competitor. However, since the witness does not wish to be the sole con-
demner, she is unlikely to condemn. In contrast, when a witness observes a trans-
gression of commission (e.g., the player recommends the dish), the witness is
relatively confident that others present interpret the transgression as purposely
harmful, since his recommendation reveals that the player was obviously paying
attention and therefore intended to harm his opponent. So, if all other individuals
present condemn the tennis player when they observe the commission, each does
not anticipate being the sole condemner.

For the above result to hold, all that is needed is the following: (1) The more the costs
of punishment decrease, the more others punish and (2) omissions are usually unintended
(Dalkiran, Hoffman, Paturi, Ricketts, & Vattani, 2012; Hoffman et al., 2015).*

*Tn fact, even if one knows that others know that the transgression was intended, omission will still
be judged as less wrong, since the transgression still won’t create what game theorists call common
p-belief, which is required for an event to influence behavior in a game with multiple equilibria.

I don’t know whether those stories were true. But the point was that while he had

Islamic caliphate.
The concept of the state

Today’s debate within Hamas over the concept of the state is more
concrete than theoretical. The political conditions in the Palestinian
territories do not allow for dreaming about unrealistic grand theories being
promoted by some Islamist movements. Hamas is facing real-world
problems that require real-world solutions. The Palestinian state being
envisioned by Palestinian, Arab, and world politicians is based on the June
1967 borders. But does that fit Hamas’s political vision and intellectual
orientation? Generations of Islamists have been raised on the concept of
the “Islamic state,” which is synonymous with the Islamic caliphate. But
Hamas’s situation is a little different. Israel’s occupation of all Palestinian
territories is a political and concrete obstacle to the dream of an Islamic
state and it forces the consideration of more realistic options. So we have
started hearing, from Hamas, statements about establishing a Palestinian
state on the June 1967 borders. There is no doubt that this development is
an intellectual and political shift by Hamas. More than 20 years ago,
Hamas founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin proposed a long truce with Israel.
But today, such a proposal is more realistic and is attributed to Hamas’s
current leader Khaled Meshaal. Hamas in 2013 is different than Hamas in
1993. Hamas is now an influential player and its statements and stances
are taken into account by regional and international decision-making
circles.

Recognition and commitment

The shuttle diplomacy by Western officials between Gaza, where Hamas’s
domestic leadership is located, and the Arab capitals of Doha, Cairo and
Amman have only one objective: getting Hamas to agree to the conditions
that would allow it to be embraced by the international community. In
other words, they want Hamas to agree to the two-state solution. And that,
explicitly or implicitly, essentially means that Hamas has recognized
Israel’s right to exist! Those who have been following Hamas’s course
since it was founded 25 years ago notice that every once in awhile there is

Prince Andrew: 2011 
p rince Andrew also fares poorly in the wake of Epstein's 
imprisonment. 
The two men are old friends. They have been ever since 
Ghislaine Maxwell introduced the prince to her then-beau, some-
time in the 1990s. In 2000, Epstein had been invited to Windsor 
Castle to celebrate the queen's birthday. Six months later, Epstein 
flew to Sandringham, the queen's estate in Norfolk, England, for 
a party Prince Andrew threw for Ghislaine's thirty-ninth birthday. 
The prince had also visited Epstein on several occasions, in 
Palm Beach as well as in New York. And if allegations Virginia 
Roberts made in her 2015 declaration are to be believed, Epstein 
asked her to give the prince whatever he required, then report 
back with the details. 
According to the Guardian, Epstein and the prince had par-
tied together at Windsor Castle, in Saint-Tropez, and in Thailand,

where Andrew was pictured on a yacht surrounded by topless 
women. 
According to Roberts's lawsuit, Epstein had forced her into 
the prince's bed on Little Saint Jeff's. 
After Epstein's conviction, the British press were using another 
name for Little Saint Jeff's: Sex Island. The Guardian reported 
that the manager of two Virgin Islands—based corporations owned 
by Epstein happened to be the wife of the governor of the Virgin 
Islands. There were allegations involving a million-dollar dona-
tion that Epstein had made to the governor's reelection cam-
paign. And then there was Roberts's claim that she had been 
forced to have sex with the prince on the island as well as in 
New York and in London. 
Invariably, the photograph of Prince Andrew with his arm 
around the bare midriff of a very young-looking Virginia Rob-
erts ran with stories that appeared in the tabloids. 
It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form 
of sexual contact or relationship with Roberts, Buckingham 
Palace spokespersons would say. The allegations made are false 
and without any foundation. 
The prince's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, 
while on a skiing trip with the prince and their daughter Euge-
nie in Switzerland, told reporters, He is the greatest man there 
is. It was the finest moment of my life in 1986 when I married 
him. He is a great man, the best in the world.

and as a great father and a humongously good man and all the 
work he does for Britain I won't stand by and let him have his 
character defamed to this level. 
But at the same time, a certain schadenfreude attended the 
good man's fall from grace, and former associates kept coming 
out of the woodwork to dish to the press. 
I've seen him treat his staff in a shocking, appalling way, 
said a former aide to the prince. He's been incredibly rude to his 
personal protection officers, literally throwing things on the 
ground and demanding they 'fucking pick them up.' No social 
graces at all. Sure, if you're a lady with blond hair and big boobs, 
then I bet he's utterly charming. 
Despite all this, the prince had stuck by Epstein. There was even 
a photo, frequently trotted out by the tabloids, of the two of them 
strolling in Central Park. 
Some few months before it was taken, a reporter posing as a 
businessman had secretly taped Sarah Ferguson's demand for 
five hundred thousand pounds in return for access to the prince. 
If you want to meet him in your business, she'd said then, 
look after me, and he'll look after you. You'll get it back tenfold. 
Once again, she said afterward, my errors have corn-
pounded and rebounded and also impacted on the man I admire 
most in the world: the Duke.

real estate deals, sticky romances, highly embarrassing docu-
ment dumps (courtesy of Julian Assange and WikiLeaks), and

questionable ties to Tunisian oligarchs, corrupt presidents of 
former Soviet republics, and Mu'ammar Gadhafi, among other 
entanglements, many of which were explored in a Vanity Fair 
article headlined THE TROUBLE WITH ANDREW. 
The duke has a record of being loyal to his friends, a royal 
source told Vanity Fair's Edward Klein. Take his feelings for 
Sarah Ferguson. If you are a prince and you bring a woman into 
the royal life and, for whatever reasons, she's spit out, you might 
have feelings of debt toward her. The duke feels that she's been 
spattered and rejected. His close relationship with the Duchess 
of York is problematic, and there have been many problems over 
the last 5 to 10 years, all of which stem from the duchess. Some 
of the behavior of the duchess is inconsistent with being mar-
ried to, or an ex-wife of, the duke. There's no question but that 
Sarah's been a financially self-destructive element in the -duke's 
life. 
The same kind of loyalty manifested itself last December, 
when the duke visited Epstein at his home in New York, said a 
spokesperson for Buckingham Palace. Epstein was a friend of 
the duke's for the best part of 20 years. It was the first time in 
four years that he'd seen Epstein. He now recognizes that the 
meeting in December was unwise. 
Don't expect to see a photo of the two of them together, 
another royal source would say. 
But one more story about the prince's dealings with Jeffrey 
Epstein had already emerged. 
At a dinner party at Epstein's town house, the prince dished 
about the wedding of his nephew Prince William to Kate 
Middleton.

Queen wear, would his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson be invited? 
Other guests in attendance that night included Chelsea Han-
dler, George Stephanopoulos,. Charlie Rose, Katie Couric, and 
Woody Allen. 
At around the same time, Jeffrey Epstein told the New York 
Post, I'm not a sexual predator, I'm an 'offender.' It's the differ-
ence between a murderer and a person who steals a bagel. 
Was it so remarkable that Prince Andrew would have been seen 
in Epstein's company? Andrew's philandering had been tabloid 
fodder for years. Randy Andy, they called him in the UK. And in 
the circles that Jeffrey Epstein moved in, philandering wasn't 
seen as a vice. Epstein came of age just as industrywide deregu-
lation took hold on Wall Street. Junk bonds were king. Call girls 
were charging ten thousand dollars a night. And in the shadows, 
you'd see things that would have made Caligula blush. Sights 
that would make Nero himself reach for the nearest fire extin-
guisher. When the urge presented itself, the new super rich 
didn't have to swap wives. 
They could simply swap harems. 
By the same token, was it so very strange to think that a man 
like the prince would have grown so detached from reality—
insofar as reality is even a word that applies to a prince? Was it 
odd that he thought it was absolutely fine to be seen by photog-
raphers strolling through Central Park with a registered sex 
offender—when at the time large swaths of the financial, bank-
ing, and trading industries were characterized by their very 
225 
JAMES PATTERSON 
detachment from day-to-day concerns such as morality, ethics, 
and appearances? 
As for Jeffrey Epstein, one question that might be worth ask-
ing is, if he's in fact a narcissist and megalomaniac, could he 
actually believe that he's innocent? Then again, that might be the 
wrong question. Epstein did plead guilty, after all. But what if he 
simply doesn't see what he pleaded to as a crime? What if he's 
proud of his lifestyle? And if that's the case, why wouldn't Prince 
Andrew be proud to be seen in public with his dear friend Jeffrey 
Epstein? 
What if, for people like Epstein and the prince, it's just ser-
vants and masters, the way of the world? They're natural winners — 
aristocrats, after all—and if life were fair, well, how would we 
know who the real winners are?

CHAPTER 59 
Anna Salter: November 2015 
hy do powerful men do the things that Jeffrey Epstein 
and Prince Andrew have been accused of doing? 
Dr. Anna Salter studies child sex offenders profes-
sionally. Educated at Harvard, with a graduate degree in clinical 
psychology, she spoke, with the benefit of hindsight, about Jeffrey 
Epstein and others like him from her office in Madison, Wisconsin. 
Consider a car, says Dr. Salter. There's a motor, and there 
are brakes. We all have sexual impulses we don't think it would 
• be a good idea to act on. Most of us have good control over our 
behavior. We have good brakes. 
Sexual offenses and inappropriate sexual behavior are some-
times the result of a bad motor—for example, an attraction to 
prepubescent children or eleven-to-fourteen-year-old pubescent 
children as opposed to postpubescent individuals. But they are 
always the result of bad brakes.

Antisocial psychopaths don't have brakes at all. 
Dr. Salter has never met Epstein, but she's followed his case 
closely and finds him a familiar type. She's especially struck by 
the singular nature of the relationship between powerful, wealthy 
men and vulnerable, underage women. 
[The men] are more impressive to a fourteen-year-old [girl] 
than to, say, an adult young woman who is self-supporting and 
feels more sure of herself, she explains. 
They are attracted to what they call freshness—barely bud-
ding sexuality and lack of sexual experience. The difference 
between them and their victims feeds their ego. 
Great wealth and access are generally factors that make men 
feel they are entitled to whomever and whatever they want. Some 
have narcissistic personalities with inflated self-images. And of 
course, great wealth and status make such men think they can 
get away with it. Too often, they're right. 
On the other hand, Dr. Salter believes that certain condi-
tions, such as the ones exhibited by Jeffrey Epstein, might be an 
inborn character trait. 
Personality can be influenced, sometimes quite heavily, by 
genetics. 
Virtually no one believes anymore that humans are born a 
totally blank slate, she explains. 
We arrive with temperamental and personality variations 
that, of course, the environment can often, but not always, influ-
ence. We arrive with baggage. 
Is Epstein a born psychopath, then?

have a conscience. Pyschopaths are often narcissistic, but nar-
cissists are often not psychopathic. Some individuals who prer.

medicated it with thinking errors. Others are flat-out psycho-
pathic and simply don't care if it hurts the young girl or not. I 
can't say anything about Epstein, as I have not evaluated him, 
but narcissism and psychopathy are concepts an evaluator would 
look at concerning anyone who was sexually attracted to postpu-
bescent individuals but who then began to focus on younger 
teens. 
Psychopaths are often superficially charming, high-stimulus 
seekers who are bored if not doing something. They lie, con, and 
manipulate. They do not establish deep affective ties. 
They are callous and remorseless individuals who simply 
don't feel bad about harming someone. 
Rules don't apply to them because they are exceptional. 
They are sure they won't get caught.

CHAPTER 60 
Jeffrey Epstein: July 2010 
Jeffrey Epstein was done with jail, but he wasn't done settling 
suits brought by his victims. Under the conditions of his 
non-prosecution agreement, he's even paid for the victims' 
lawyers. Still, Epstein's NPA seemed to ensure that he would not 
be prosecuted again for his crimes. Double jeopardy was work-
ing in Epstein's favor. But in July of 2010, reports began to appear 
in the press: federal investigators were following other leads—
leads that could result in child-trafficking charges and a 
twenty-year sentence. 
The Florida attorney general's office refused to comment. It 
was against policy to confirm or deny the existence of an ongo-
ing investigation. One of Epstein's lawyers told the Daily Beast 
that he had no knowledge of such an investigation. Jeffrey 
Epstein has fully complied with all state and federal require-
ments that arise from the prior proceedings in Palm Beach, jack

Goldberger said. There are no pending civil lawsuits. There are 
not and should not be any pending investigations, given Mr. 
Epstein's complete fulfillment of all the terms of his non-prosecution 
agreement with the federal government. 
If there was an investigation, nothing had come of it yet. For 
the moment, Epstein was free—free to turn his attention, again, 
to intellectual pursuits. He launched a website, JeffreyEpstein-
Science.com, that featured blog posts such as Conversations 
with Jeffrey Epstein, The Value of Quantum Computation to 
Jeffrey Epstein, Why Evolutionary Biology Intrigues Jeffrey 
Epstein, and An Understanding of Theoretical Physics from 
Jeffrey Epstein. The latter post began: This is where Jeffrey 
Epstein takes you to the very cutting edge of the frontiers of 
knowledge to explore and discuss our basic understanding of 
the subtle, simple, and hidden [qualities] that lie beneath ... our 
universe. 
Jeffrey doesn't know shit about science, says Stuart Pivar, the 
art collector who has known Epstein for more than three decades. 
Does he like to act like he does? Yes. But he doesn't. But as far as 
these academic scientists—without people like him they wouldn't 
have any money. 
Other friends of Epstein's say that he truly did have a bril-
liant mind for science. And in any case, Epstein had done more 
than sponsor individual scientists. He'd also sponsored confer-
ences on Little Saint Jeff's. On his website, he announced a con-
ference called Mindshift at which Nobel laureates, such as the 
theoretical physicist Murray Gell-Mann, would mix with sur-
geons, engineers, and futurists and where professors would 
231 
JAMES PATTERSON 
discuss cognitive neuroscience, artificial intelligence, systems of 
encryption and decryption, and other topics. 
Epstein had been hosting get-togethers like this for years. 
Toward the end of Chief Reiter's investigation, in March of 2006, 
Epstein had hosted twenty top physicists—including three Nobel 
Prize winners as well as the celebrity physicist Stephen Hawking—
at a Saint Thomas symposium called Confronting Gravity, 
which was advertised as a workshop to explore fundamental 
questions in physics and cosmology. 
This is a remarkable group, one of the Nobel Prize winners 
told a reporter for the St. Thomas Source. 
There is no agenda except fun and physics, and that's fun 
with a capital F, Epstein said. 
Epstein had been especially interested in Stephen Hawking. 
Someday, Hawking had theorized, the universe would stop 
expanding and collapse, at which point time would begin to run 
backwards. Hawking believed that computer viruses were living 
things. He thought that given the size of the universe, alien life 
forms existed. He did not believe in God. But he had a vast appre-
ciation for the inner workings of the universe, and this is why 
Epstein gave Hawking a tremendous gift. He paid to have a sub-
marine modified so that it could fit Hawking and his wheelchair 
and give the scientist his first glimpse of an actual alien world—
the one that lies under the waves of the ocean. 
It was one of the most romantic, generous gestures that Jef-
frey Epstein had ever made.

CHAPTER 61 
Al Seckel: January 2012 
Epstein's partner in the Mindshift conference, a man named 
Al Seckel, was known for throwing fabulous parties that 
were said to have included the actor Dudley Moore, magi-
cian James the Amazing Randi, and future Tesla and SpaceX 
founder Elon Musk, as well as many of the scientists Jeffrey 
Epstein would court in the course of his own climb up the social 
ladder. 
In certain Los Angeles circles, Al Seckel was a very good man 
to know. But, like Jeffrey Epstein, Seckel was a sort of illusionist. 
According to Mark Oppenheimer, a journalist who knew Seckel 
and followed his career for fifteen years, Seckel made his money 
by selling rare books and papers, often through his social and 
academic connections. 
A number of these transactions resulted in accusations and 
wsuits, Oppenheimer would write. In speaking to former 
233 
JAMES PATTERSON 
Seckel acquaintances, I kept hearing variations on a scheme Mrs. 
Pearce Williams believed he perpetrated against her late hus-
band, the man Seckel said was his mentor. Seckel took books 
and promised money, or he took money and promised a book; 
but somehow, the promised party lost money. 
He was charming, erudite, humorous, one of Seckel's marks 
told the reporter. I lent him $75,000. When the time came to 
pay it back he didn't want to do it. 
Oppenheimer found several people whom Seckel had stiffed 
and uncovered dozens of lawsuits he'd been involved in. In 2007, 
Seckel settled a libel lawsuit against a man who'd edited his Wiki-
pedia page. Years later, Oppenheimer spoke with Seckel's lawyer, 
Nicholas Hornberger. 
Hornberger confirmed that he'd reached a settlement for the 
case, a favorable one, the journalist wrote. Hornberger added 
that Seckel has still not paid him for his services. 
He also interviewed Seckel's wife, Isabel Maxwell. 
Al and Isabel met on a blind date and married in Malibu in or 
around 2007 (I don't keep the dates in my head, Seckel 
explained). A few years later, they moved to the South of France, 
where Seckel continued to trade in rare books and papers. While 
living in France, he was sued by a Virgin Islands company that 
accused him and Isabel of fraudulently attempting to sell rare 
books and a seventeenth-century portrait of Isaac Newton. 
Seckel had also been trying to sell papers belonging to Isa-
bel's father. 
Isabel is Ghislaine Maxwell's sister and the daughter of Rob-
ert Maxwell.

It was an odd thing, Epstein's association with this self-professed 
PhD who, on closer inspection, turned out to be a bit of a grifter. 
But the Mindshift conference that Epstein and Seckel hosted 
in the Virgin Islands did take place, in 2010. Murray Gell-
Mann was there, along with Leonard Mlodinow, a physicist who 
coauthored books with Stephen Hawking. Gerald Sussman, an 
expert on artificial intelligence who taught at MIT and also 
attended the conference, said that he didn't remember too much 
about it. 
We had scientific discussions, talked about various things, 
he said vaguely. 
When Mark Oppenheimer asked him if he'd given money to 
Seckel, Sussman got testy with the reporter. 
I have had some dealings with him, Sussman said. I don't 
want to say what it's about, because I don't feel good about 
it, okay? 
Today, Epstein's websites— JeffreyEpsteinFoundation.com and 
JeffreyEpsteinScience.com —are down. Their domain names have 
long since expired. Several recipients of Epstein's charitable con-
tributions, including New York's Mount Sinai Hospital and Ballet 
Palm Beach, announced that they would not be accepting new 
gifts. 
The further I can keep myself from anything like that the 
better, said Ballet Palm Beach founder Colleen Smith. 
But in 2012, Epstein held one more conference on Little Saint 
Jeff's. Once again, three Nobel Prize winners were in attendance. 
Stephen Hawking was also there. All in all, Epstein had gathered 
twenty-one physicists—from Princeton, Harvard, MIT, and CERN

Jeffrey Epstein: February 2, 2011 
It's Groundhog Day, and once-reclusive Jeffrey Epstein is hit-
ting the peak of his fame in a ripped-from-the-headlines epi-
sode of Law & Order: SVU that tracks, eerily well, with his 
own legal history. 
The setup for this episode is the rape of a very young French 
girl. One who's been flown to New York on a very rich man's pri-
vate jet, then flown back—coach class— to Paris. 
On the plane, she has a freak-out. She thinks the middle-aged 
guy sitting next to her is trying to rape her. In Paris, the local 
police get involved. 
It was just a birthday party, the tearful girl tells the SVU 
cops via videoconference from France. We were his present.

Non, says the girl. Non! Jamais! Jamais! 
For Epstein, there are other embarrassments, many of which 
have to do with his royal friends. The wedding of Prince Wil-
liam and Kate Middleton is approaching, and the ongoing trou-
bles of Prince William's uncle Prince Andrew keep threatening 
to derail the festivities. On March 6, a spokesperson for Sarah 
Ferguson confirms that Epstein paid off part of the seventy-eight 
thousand pounds that the duchess borrowed from a man who 
was once her personal assistant. 
The next day, headlines appear in the Telegraph and other 
British papers: DUKE OF YORK APPEALED TO JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO HELP 
DUCHESS PAY DEBT. 
I personally, on behalf of myself, deeply regret that Jeffrey 
Epstein became involved in any way with me, Prince Andrew's 
ex-wife tells journalists. I abhor paedophilia and any sexual 
abuse of children and know that this was a gigantic error of 
judgment on my behalf. 
I am just so contrite I cannot say. Whenever I can I will 
repay the money and will have nothing ever to do with Jeffrey 
Epstein ever again. 
That week, as part of the ongoing civil lawsuits against 
Epstein, Sarah Kellen and Nadia Marcinkova are both asked 
about Prince Andrew's relations with Epstein.

CHAPTER 63 
Alan Dershowitz: September 2014 
If the ongoing lawsuits are costing Epstein millions, he has 
millions left to spare. Meanwhile, the FBI's investigation into 
whether Epstein trafficked underage women across state lines 
seems to be going nowhere. As 2014 draws to a close, it's begin-
ning to look as if Epstein is finally free and clear of the case. 
But for Epstein's friend and sometime lawyer Alan Dershow-
itz, things are about to get very unpleasant. 
At the start of 2008, Bradley Edwards, the Fort Lauderdale 
lawyer, had filed a motion in a West Palm Beach court on behalf 
of two unnamed women accusing Prince Andrew and Alan Der-
showitz of participating directly in Epstein's illegal activities. 
Prince Andrew had had no comment to make, and Dershow-
itz had objected to the accusations in the strongest • possible 
terms. 
There's absolutely no kernel of truth to this story, he'd said.

15, 2015, in a declaration

are highly disturbing. 
I don't know this woman. I've never been in the same place with 
her. She's made the whole story up out of whole cloth. 
Bradley Edwards had already become involved in lawsuits 
against Epstein. In 2007, working with a former federal judge 
and University of Utah law professor named Paul Cassell, he had 
filed a lawsuit on behalf of another unnamed woman. Six years 
later, that case is still pending, and now, Edwards and Cassell 
petition to have the two suits combined. 
All in all, four Jane Does take part in the lawsuit. 
Jane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts, the girl who says that Ghis-
laine Maxwell recruited her for Epstein at Trump's resort, 
Mar-a-Lago. 
Epstein had lent her and other young girls to prominent 
businessmen, important politicians, world leaders, and other 
powerful men in order to ingratiate himself with them for busi-
ness, personal, political, and financial gain, as well as to obtain 
blackmail information, Roberts claims. 
She says that Epstein forced her and other underage girls to 
take part in an orgy in the Virgin Islands. 
She names Prince Andrew and Alan Dershowitz as two of the 
men she'd been forced to have sex with and claims that Der-
showitz had been an eyewitness to the sexual abuse of many 
other minors by Epstein and several of Epstein's co-conspirators. 
This time, Prince Andrew does respond to the allegations. 
This relates to longstanding and ongoing civil proceedings 
in the United States, to which the Duke of York is not a party, 
Buckingham Palace says in a short statement. As such we would 
not comment on the detail. However, for the avoidance of doubt, 
any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categori-
cally untrue.

Alan Dershowitz also goes on the attack. Virginia's claims 
are part of a plot to extort him, he claims. The motion that 
Edwards and Cassell have filed is the sleaziest legal document 
he's ever seen. 
They manipulated a young, suggestible woman who was 
interested in money, Dershowitz says. This is a disbarrable 
offense, and they will be disbarred. They will rue the day they 
ever made this false charge against me. It's a vehement denial. 
But then, the allegations made by Virginia Roberts, on January 
15, 2015, in a declaration filed against the government in an 
attempt to overturn Jeffrey Epstein's non-prosecution agreement, 
are highly disturbing.

Epstein frequently. Dershowitz was so comfortable with the

in sexual activity with Epstein.

times. The first time was when I was about 16, early on in 
my servitude to Epstein, and it continued until I was 19. 
22. The first time we had sex took place in New York in 
Epstein's home. It was in Epstein's room (not the massage 
room). I was approximately sixteen years old at the time. I 
called Dershowitz Alan. I knew he was a famous professor.

Ranch in New Mexico in the massage room off of the indoor

25. We also had sex at Little Saint James Island in the 
U.S. Virgin Islands. 
26. Another sexual encounter between me and Dershow-
itz happened on Epstein's airplane. Another girl was present 
on the plane with us. 
27. I have recently seen Alan Dershowitz on television 
calling me a liar He is lying by denying that he had sex 
with me. The man I've seen on television, described as a for-
mer law professor, is the same man that I had sex with at 
least six times. Dershowitz also knows that Epstein had sex 
with other underage girls and lent me out to other people, 
but he is lying and denying that. . . . 
28. After years of abuse and being lent out, I began to 
look for a way to escape. I had first gone into Epstein's house-
hold because I wanted to be a massage therapist. Epstein had 
taken me into his clutches through promises and talk and for 
some time I believed him. But once he had me under his con-
trol, regardless of my doubts and fears, I felt trapped. 
29. I kept asking Epstein for my promised training and 
education. Epstein finally got me a plane ticket to Thailand 
to go to Chiang Mai to learn Thai massage. This sounded 
like my chance to escape. In September 2002, I packed my 
bags for good. I knew this would be my only opportunity to 
break away. 
30. On September 27, 2002, I flew from JFK in New York 
to Chiang Mai, Thailand. I arrived around September 29 for 
my training. But Epstein was going to get something out of 
245 
JAMES PATTERSON 
this trip as well. I was supposed to interview a girl and bring 
her back to the United States for Epstein. 
31. [Left blank in the original] 
32. I did the massage training in Chiang Mai. While I 
was there, I met a great and special guy and told him hon-
estly what I was being forced to do. He told me I should get 
out of it. I told him that the people I was working for were 
very powerful and that I could not walk away or disobey 
them without risking serious punishment, including my life. 
He told me he would protect me. I had confidence [in] him 
and I saw his love and help as my opportunity to escape and 
to be with someone who truly loved me and would protect 
me. I married him and flew to Australia. 
33. I called Epstein and told him I was not coming back. 
He asked why? I said I've fallen in love. Epstein basically 
said good luck and have a good life. I could tell he was not 
happy. I was afraid of what he was going to do to me. I 
thought he or one of his powerful friends might send some-
one to hurt me or have me killed. 
34. From that point onward, out of concern for my safety 
and general well-being, I stayed in Australia with my hus-
band. I was in Australia from late 2002 to October 2013. To 
be clear, I was never in the United States during these years, 
not even for a short trip to visit my mother. And my absence 
from the United States was not voluntary —I was hiding 
from Epstein out of fear of what he would do to me if I 
returned to the United States. 
35. In around 2007, after not hearing from anyone for 
years, out of the blue I was contacted by someone who identi-

with the FBI. It seemed very odd for someone doing an offi-
cial criminal investigation to just call up on the phone like 
that. I hadn't heard Epstein's name for years. I didn't know 
who this person was and what it was really about. I couldn't 
tell what was going on. 
36. This man said he was looking into Jeffrey Epstein. 
The man asked if I had been involved with Epstein. My first 
instinct was to say nothing because I wasn't sure he was 
really with the FBI or any authorities. I answered a few basic 
questions, telling him that I knew Jeffrey Epstein and had 
met him at a young age. But the conversation didn't feel right. 
This man never offered to come and meet with me in person. 
Instead, he asked me right off the bat about Epstein's sexual 
practices. I thought it would be strange for a true law enforce-
ment officer to behave that way, so I became increasingly 
uncomfortable and suspicious about who was actually call-
ing me. 
37. I told the man nothing more about Epstein. The con-
versation probably didn't even last three minutes, but it 
immediately triggered all of the fears of Epstein and his pow-
erful friends that had caused me to escape in the first place. 
If the call accomplished anything, it only put me bath in a 
state of fear and told me that I could be found quite easily 
and had nobody officially protecting me. 
38. I suspected that the man who called me was working 
for Epstein or one of Epstein's powerful friends. I believed that 
if this was really an agent who was investigating Epstein, he 
would have known who I was and how I fit into Epstein's sex-
ual crimes in many different places. He would have inter-
viewed me in a way that would have established his credentials

against him were false and 
and would have shown how he could provide potential protec-
tion from Epstein. That never happened. 
39. Getting a call from this supposed FBI agent made me 
scared all over again. I had left the old life of sexual slavery 
behind me and started a new life in a new country in hopes 
that the powerful people whose illegal activities I knew all 
about would never find me. 
40. Shortly after this purported FBI call, I was contacted 
by telephone by someone who appeared clearly to be working 
for Epstein. The caller told me about an investigation into 
Epstein and said that some of the girls being questioned were 
saying that Epstein had had sexual contact with them. After 
they made these allegations, the man said they were being 
discredited as drug addicts and prostitutes, but in my case, if 
I were to keep quiet, I would be looked after. The fact that 
this call was made shortly after the supposed FBI call rein-
for[c]ed my concern that the man I had talked to earlier was 
not really working for the FBI but for Epstein. I didn't think 
that the FBI and Epstein would both be working together and 
would both get my phone number at almost exactly the same 
time. I played along and told this person that I had gotten a 
call from the FBI but that I didn't tell him anything. The 
person on the phone was pleased to hear [that]. 
41. A short time later, one of Epstein's lawyers (not Alan 
Dershowitz) called me, and then got Epstein on the line at 
the same time. Epstein and his lawyer basically asked again 
if I was going to say anything. The clear implication was that 
I should not. The way they were talking to me, I was afraid of 
what would happen if I didn't keep quiet. My thought was

to [be the] way to keep me and my family safe. And I did 
what Epstein and his lawyer told me. I kept quiet. 
This declaration, stricken from the record by the judge in the 
victims' lawsuit against the government, also set in motion 
events that led to Dershowitz's and Roberts's lawyers becoming 
involved in spectacular lawsuits, which included a complaint by 
Dershowitz that these allegations were false and had defamed 
him, and a complaint by Edwards that Dershowitz's accusations 
against him were false and defamatory.

CHAPTER 65 
Alan Dershowitz: October 2015 
About fifteen minutes into the ripped-from-the-headlines 
episode of Law & Order: SVU that was inspired by the Jef-
frey Epstein saga, the plot takes an interesting turn: before 
officers have a chance to arrest him, Jordan, the character mod-
eled on Epstein, shows up at SVU headquarters. 
The twelve-year-old French girl raped him, Jordan says. 
Wearing a monogrammed fleece pullover like the ones favored 
by Jeffrey Epstein, he describes an evening at home. 
The party was in full swing, he explains. A friend said she 
wanted to give me a special present. Told me to wait in my mas-
sage room—

enjoy myself. But then it got rough, and that's when I opened my 
eyes. 
What did you see? 
A woman. A woman I'd never seen before. 
A woman? Dominique Moreau was twelve! 
It was dark. I just wanted her off of me. I tried to stop her. 
But the twelve-year-old overpowered you? 
No. She threatened me. She said if I didn't let her ... continue, 
she was going to scream 'Rape. 
And there was nothing that you could do? You've got forty 
years and a hundred pounds on the girl. 
The party was going on right outside the door. I knew how this 
was going to look. I was naked. She was naked. What could I do? 
It was a brilliant plot twist—one that ultimately allowed Jor-
dan to get off scot-free. 
But the plot twist that Epstein's own story ended up taking 
on the day of Alan Dershowitz's deposition at a Broward County, 
Florida, courthouse was even more surprising. 
There was a criminal extortion plot, Alan Dershowitz told Brad 
Edwards and Paul Cassell's lawyer, Jack Scarola, on October 15, 
2015. 
Your clients were involved. 
Bradley and Cassell had sued Dershowitz in Broward County 
for defamation—payback for extremely negative comments the 
law professor had made in the media. 
Dershowitz had countersued. His reputation was on the line, 
and he had come armed for battle. 
251 
JAMES PATTERSON 
I'm thrilled they sued me, he'd told reporters. In the end, 
someone will be disbarred. Either it will be me or the two 
lawyers. 
But if Dershowitz was swinging for the fences in his struggle 
to keep his hard-earned reputation afloat, he still had a bomb-
shell to drop. When deposed by Scarola, he proposed his own 
theory about why Virginia Roberts had named him, along with 
Prince Andrew, as one of the men who had sexually abused her 
at Epstein's New Mexico ranch, in New York City, and in Palm 
Beach. 
A theory that implicated the lawyers who were suing him in a 
much larger conspiracy. 
According to Dershowitz, Brad Edwards pressured Virginia 
Roberts into identifying Dershowitz as one her assailants. 
Dershowitz said that Edwards did this so that they could 
blackmail Jeffrey Epstein's patron Leslie Wexner for one billion 
dollars. 
Roberts lied about him, Dershowitz maintained, to give 
Wexner an idea of what would, happen to him if Edwards's 
demands weren't met. 
Furthermore, Dershowitz said, he had proof.

Q: In an interview with Hala Gorani on January 5 of this year, 
broadcast on CNN Live, you said, I have a superb memory. 
Do you acknowledge having made that statement? 
A: I have a superb memory, so I must have made that statement. 
My mother had an extraordinary memory, and when I was in 
college and I was on the debate team, my mother allowed me 
to debate on the Sabbath, which was Jewish rest day, only on 
the condition that I not take notes or write. And at that point 
I discovered that I have a very good memory and don't have 
to—generally didn't have to take notes. My memory, obvi-
ously, at the age of seventy-seven has slipped a bit; but do I 
have a very good memory, yes.

Which of my clients are you swearing under oath encour-
aged Virginia Roberts to include allegations of an encounter 
with you at the New Mexico ranch? 
A: Both of them—both of your clients, both Judge Cassell 
and Mr. Edwards—were both involved in encouraging 
[their] client to file a perjurious affidavit that they knew or 
should have known was perjurious recently when they 
sought to file another defamatory allegation in the federal 
proceeding. 
Was the arrangement such that what you are charging Brad-
ley Edwards and Professor Paul Cassell with doing was sub-
orning perjury? 
A: Absolutely. If you ask me the question, I am directly charging 
Judge Cassell and Bradley Edwards with suborning perjury. I 
have been advised that Virginia Roberts did not want to 
mention me, told her friends that she did not want to men-
tion me. And was, quote, pressured by her lawyers into 
including these totally false allegations against me. Yes, your 
clients are guilty of suborning perjury. 
Who told you that Bradley Edwards pressured Virginia Rob-
erts into falsely identifying you? 
A: A friend of Virginia Roberts who called me out of the blue 
and told me that she was horrified by what was happening to 
me and that she recently had meetings with Virginia Roberts 
and Virginia Roberts had told her that she never mentioned 
me previously. That the lawyers pressured her into mention

At first her husband and she called me on the phone. They 
would not give me their names. But they told me [the] story. We 
had a series of phone conversations in which I asked them, 
please, to tell me their names. And after a period of time, after 
they told me the story in great detail, she was willing to give me 
her name. She asked me to promise that I would not disclose 
her identity without her permission. I have been trying to call 
her. Called her as recently as this morning and last night. 
I want to recall—I don't think I called her this morning. 
I called her twice last night to try to get her permission to 
reveal her complete name and identity. But I have the name, 
and I will be happy to give it to you. I just don't have it off the 
top of my head.

Q: Would you tell us how many phone conversations [you had] 
with this person Rebecca? 
A: More than six. Probably between six and ten, maybe closer 
to ten. The first few [times] she called me, and after I got 
their number I called her a number of times. 
Q: What is her husband's name? 
A: Michael. Different last name from hers, but again. 
Q: Where do they live? 
A: Palm Beach. Or West Palm Beach, in the Palm Beach area. They 
have been friends of Virginia Roberts since she was a young child. 
Q: Were there any witnesses to any of these phone conversa-
tions other than Rebecca, Michael, and you? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Who? 
A: My wife. 
Q: When did the first conversation occur? 
A: I can probably get you specific information about that. But it 
was months ago. When the story was in the newspapers, she 
called and related the entire story to me and related to me 
that it was part of a massive extortion plot.

recollection. 
10:45 a.m. 
Q: 
So from the very first conversation that you had with this 
person, you had information indicating that this person was 
informing you that Bradley Edwards had engaged in unethi-
cal conduct, correct? 
A: Let me just be very clear what she said to me. She said to me 
that she had been told directly by her friend Virginia Rob-
erts, who stayed with her overnight for a period of time, that 
she never wanted to mention me in any of the pleadings. And 
that her two lawyers in the pleadings, or her lawyers who 
filed the pleadings, pressured her into including my name 
and details. 
Did Rebecca ever suggest to you that the details sworn to by 
Virginia Roberts were false? 
She certainly suggested that, yes. She mentioned to me that 
Virginia Roberts had never, ever mentioned [me to her], 
among any of the people that she had had any contact with, 
until she—until she was pressured into doing so by her law-
yers, yes. 
So from the very first conversation, the impression you had 
was that this was a witness who could provide information 
that Bradley Edwards and Paul Cassell had acted unethically 
and dishonestly, correct? 
A: I wasn't sure she could provide the information because she 
was very reluctant to come forward. She didn't want to be

Q: Was any request made by you for a meeting? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Let me back up then, if I could, please. Because what I want 
you to do, based upon your superb memory, is to tell us in as 
much detail as you possibly can recall everything that was 
said.... 
A: I'm not sure the request for the meeting came in the first call 
or the second call.... The first call was basically, I'd really 
like to talk to your wife [Rebecca] about this. I'm happy to fly 
down. I'm happy to talk to you on the phone. And we left it 
that they would think—that she would—that he would ask 
her to think about it. And that I could call back in a—in a 
few days and find out what her—what her current feelings 
were. 
Q: Where were you when you received this phone call—or 
when you made this phone call? Sorry. 
A: I think I was in New York. 
Q: Do you know whether that phone call was made on a cell 
phone or a landline? 
A: I don't remember. 
Q: Have you attempted to gather your telephone records for pur-
poses of responding to discovery requests in this case? 
259 
JAMES PATTERSON 
A: I left that to my lawyers. I know that we did produce tele-
phone records during the relevant periods of time when Vir-
ginia Roberts knew Jeffrey Epstein, and those telephone 
records established that I could not have been at the loca-
tions and at the times that Virginia Roberts claimed to have 
had—falsely claimed to have [had] sexual contact with me. 
Q: I promise you we're going to get to those. 
A: Good. 
Q: Promise you. Along with all the flight logs that you claim 
exonerate you. 
11:11 a.m. 
Q: Let's go to the very second contact that you had with either 
Michael or Rebecca. Who initiated the second contact? 
A: I think I did. I called and got Michael on the phone. 
Q: Where did you call from? 
A: I think New York. 
Q: Tell me in as much detail as your superb memory allows you 
to recall everything that was said during the course of that 
phone conversation.

which I have adopted.

260 
Q: I'm sorry—she said yes when you asked Michael if he had

A: He said yes. And that she was still reluctant to talk to me. I 
suggested to him that perhaps she could talk to me briefly 
just so that she hears what I have to say. And he could listen 
and remain on the phone, and she could stop at any time she 
wanted. And there came a time during that conversation 
when she did get on the phone, and here's what she told me. 
She said she had grown up with Virginia Roberts. That they 
were very, very close friends as young people. That Virginia 
Roberts came to stay with her for a number of days, I think it 
was over Halloween, and they had gone out and had dinner, 
just the two of them. And that she confided in her; Virginia 
Roberts confided in Rebecca that she had never wanted to 
mention me in any of the pleadings, but she was pressured 
by her lawyer into doing so. Rebecca then said that I was not 
the object of this effort. The object of the effort was a billion-
aire who lives in Columbus, Ohio, and who owns Victoria's 
Secret and Limited Too. Rebecca told me she did not know 
the name of that billionaire, but that Virginia and her law-
yers hoped to get one billion dollars, b-i-l-l-i-o-n, one billion 
dollars, or half of his net worth, from him by alleging that he 
had improperly engaged in sexual misconduct with Virginia 
Roberts. That money would be divided three ways: a third of 
it to Virginia Roberts, a third of it to a charity that she and 
her lawyers were setting up for battered women, and a third 
of it to the lawyers. 
She then told me that they were trying to get ABC News 
to interview Virginia Roberts so as to give her credibility in 
order to pressure the billionaire from Columbus, Ohio, into 
261 
Q:

paying a large sum of money. And that I was named as an 
effort to try to show the billionaire what could happen to 
somebody if they were accused of sexual misconduct. And 
that would encourage him to settle a lawsuit or pay money in 
exchange for his name not being mentioned or revealed. I 
had no idea about this. And I didn't —I didn't ask about this. 
She just stated this. And I then corroborated the fact that she 
was absolutely correct in everything she had said to me. 
You corroborated the fact that she was absolutely correct in 
everything that she had said to you? 
That's right. 
How? 
Okay. Let me answer that question. I was very—I wasn't sure, 
so I called Leslie Wexner. I got his wife on the phone, Abigail 
Wexner. Obviously I knew that the only billionaire in Colum-
bus, Ohio, who owned Limited Too and who owned Victoria's 
Secret was Leslie Wexner. I had met Leslie Wexner on two 
occasions, I think, and his wife. I called Abigail on the phone 
and I said, I think you ought to know that there is an extor-
tion plot being directed against your husband by unscrupu-
lous lawyers in—in Florida. And she said, Oh, we're aware 
of that; they've already been in contact with us, which sur-
prised me. But [her statement] was confirmation of that. 
then also—I can't give you the chronology of that. I then was 
in touch with ABC and found out she was absolutely correct 
about her efforts to try to get interviewed on ABC television. 
In fact, I learned that your client, Brad Edwards, had sent a 
communication to people in the area urging them to watch 
her interview that was scheduled to be on three television 
programs. If I'm not mistaken, it was [the] Good Day Show;

they would be putting false information on the air if they 
allowed Virginia Roberts to tell her false story. So I was able 
to corroborate that. I then also corroborated the fact that she 
had never mentioned me when her boyfriend appeared on 
television and publicly stated that she had never mentioned 
me in any of her description[s] of people who she had sexual 
contact with. So I was then completely satisfied that Rebecca 
was telling me the complete truth. And that in my view, there 
was an extortion plot directed against Leslie Wexner, a crimi-
nal extortion plot directed against Leslie Wexner, and that 
your clients were involved in that extortion plot. 
11:30 a.m. 
Q: Let's see if we can make sure that we're understanding one 
another, sir. Do you recognize that there's a distinction 
between Virginia Roberts having met you, having been sexu-
ally abused by you on multiple occasions, but not wanting to 
name you as opposed to Virginia Roberts never having met 
you and never having been sexually abused by you ... ? Are 
those two things different in your mind? 
A: Not in the context of this case. Because Virginia Roberts said 
that she was going to seek justice from everybody that had 
abused her. And if she didn't want to name me, I think the 
inference is inescapable that I was not among those people 
that she had had any sexual contact with. So that was cer-
tainly the inference I drew....

* * * 
Who are the people that Rebecca says Virginia had previ-
ously told her that Virginia was abused by? 
I never asked her that question. 
Did you ask her was Les Wexner one of the people that 
abused Virginia? 
I told you I never asked her the question. 
Are you aware that years before December of 2014, when the 
CVRA pleading was filed, that your name had come up 
repeatedly in connection with Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minors, 
correct? 
A: I am aware that never before 2014, end of December, was it 
ever, ever alleged that I had acted in any way inappropriately 
with regard to Virginia Roberts, that I ever touched her, that 
I ever met her, that I had ever been with her. I was completely 
aware of that. There had never been any allegation. She 
claims under oath that she told you that secretly in 2011, but 
you have produced no notes of any such conversation. You, 
of course, are a witness to this allegation and will be deposed 
as a witness to this allegation. I believe it is an entirely false 
allegation that she told you in 2011 that she had had any sex-
ual contact with me. I think she's lying through her teeth 
when she says that. And I doubt that your notes will reveal 
any such information. But if she did tell you that, she would 
be absolutely, categorically lying. So I am completely aware 
that never—until the lies were put in a legal pleading at the

and that was false. I was never a witness to any of Jeffrey 
Epstein's sexual abuse. And I wrote that to you, something 
that you have falsely denied. And I stand on the record. The 
record is clear that I have categorically denied I was ever a 
witness to any abuse, that I ever saw Jeffrey Epstein abusing 
anybody. And—and the very idea that I would stand and 
talk to Jeffrey Epstein while he was receiving oral sex from 
Virginia Roberts, which she swore to under oath, is so outra-
geous, so preposterous, that even David Boies [a prominent 
lawyer associated with the firm representing Virginia Rob-
erts] said he couldn't believe it was true. 
12:24 p.m. 
Q: You engaged in a mass-media campaign to convince the 
world that Bradley Edwards and Professor Paul Cassell were 
unethical lawyers who had fabricated false charges against 
you, correct? 
A: No, that's not correct. I responded to press inquiries by tell-
ing the truth. My goal was to let the world know that Vir-
ginia Roberts's allegations against me were totally false. 
These two stories appeared, as far as I can tell, in every single 
newspaper in the world and on every media, which was part 
of their plot and the plan of your clients, which is why they 
absurdly mentioned Prince Andrew, claiming in the most 
absurd way—that they mentioned him because he was try-
ing to lobby prosecutors to get a reduced sentence for Jeffrey

Epstein; they obviously put Prince Andrew in there in order 
to get massive publicity around the world. And every media 
in the world, practically, called me, from the BBC to CBS to 
ABC to CNN, and I responded to lies with the truth. 
And the truth that you attempted to convey was that Bradley 
Edwards and Professor Paul Cassell were unethical lawyers 
who fabricated false charges against you, right? 
A: The truth that I intended to convey was that the charges 
against me were false and fabricated, that I never had any 
sexual contact—
Fabricated by whom, sir? 
Please don't interrupt me.... that I never had any sexual con-
tact with Virginia Roberts. Because Professor Cassell insisted 
on conveying to the public that he was a former judge and 
that he was a professor and that he was using—improperly, 
in my view— the stationery and name of his university to 
add credibility to his claims, I felt that it was imperative for 
me to indicate that he was engaging in improper and unethi-
cal conduct. It would have been improper for me to have 
allowed his use of his credibility as a former federal judge, as 
a professor who uses, Misuses, his university imprimatur—
it was very important for me to attack the credibility of the 
messengers of the false information. And it was important 
for me to also remind the public that Bradley Edwards was a 
partner of [Scott] Rothstein, a man who is spending fifty 
years in jail for fraudulently creating a Ponzi scheme to sell 
Jeffrey Epstein cases that didn't exist.

CHAPTER 67 
Scott Rothstein: 2009 
Scott Rothstein was a flashy Fort Lauderdale ex-lawyer who 
parked his collection of cars in an air-conditioned ware-
house, kept a copy of the Torah on his desk, and hung a 
portrait of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone outside his office. One 
of his nicknames was TPOFD, short for the Prince of Fucking 
Darkness, and in private, he'd say things like: Understand that 
the repercussions of engaging me could open the gates of hell. 
Understand that I am capable of evil far beyond anything your 
imagination could ever conjure up. 
Rothstein hosted receptions for prominent politicians—John 
McCain, Bobby Jindal, Arnold Schwarzenegger— and handed 
out hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time in campaign 
contributions. He gave millions more to charitable institutions: 
the Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital; the American Heart 
267 
JAMES PATTERSON 
Association. By all outward appearances, he could afford it: sev-
enty lawyers worked in his firm, which had offices in Florida, 
New York, and Venezuela. But Rothstein's millions actually 
came from a $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme he'd been running since 
2005. 
In April of 2009, Bradley Edwards joined Rothstein's firm. 
The lawyer brought his papers along, and Rothstein showed 
those pertaining to Epstein to potential investors. In exchange 
for a lump sum up front, Rothstein said, investors would receive 
a far larger chunk of money later, which Epstein would pay in 
future settlements. 
Edwards and Rothstein both say that Edwards had no knowl-
edge whatsoever of the Ponzi scheme. (Prosecutors, and the 
Florida Bar, agree.) Edwards left as soon as he caught wind of the 
scheme, in November of 2009. But the few months he spent in 
Rothstein's company gave Dershowitz the opening he needed to 
pry open Virginia Roberts's accusations. 
It was at Edwards's insistence, Dershowitz would say, as well 
as Paul Cassell's, that Virginia Roberts added Dershowitz's name 
to the list of men she claimed had abused her. 
According to Dershowitz, he'd been pulled into a billion-dollar 
extortion plot Edwards had hatched. And for Edwards and Cas-
sell, there had been a secondary benefit: Dershowitz had helped 
to work out Epstein's confidential non-prosecution agreement 
with the government. By implicating him directly in Epstein's 
abuse of underage women, Dershowitz claimed, Edwards and 
Cassell were trying to open up that agreement. 
It might have been a Hail Mary pass on the part of Alan 
Dershowitz. 
But the argument had its own internal logic.

* * * 
The idea that Bradley. Edwards and Paul Cassell were trying to 
blackmail Leslie Wexner—blackmail him for one billion dollars, 
no less—sounds highly improbable. But we do know for a fact 
that Edwards had worked with Rothstein— a man who'd been 
running his own billion-dollar con. 
Edwards may not have known that Rothstein was taking his 
files on Jeffrey Epstein and showing them to investors. But 
Edwards's proximity to Rothstein didn't look good. It may not have 
been as damaging as Dershowitz's close friendship with Epstein, 
but it was damaging nonetheless. It gave Dershowitz the opening 
he needed to make his argument. And the genius of Dershowitz's 
argument was that it wasn't necessarily predicated on an actual 
plot to blackmail Wexner. Maybe the thing Edwards was really 
after was the idea that a lawyer who helped work out Epstein's 
non-prosecution agreement was also having sex with Virginia Rob-
erts. That would give Edwards leverage in trying to crack the 
agreement open. And in that case, was it so hard to imagine him 
pressuring Virginia Roberts to add Dershowitz's name to the list? 
Perhaps it wasn't, in this scenario. Virginia would have still 
felt reluctant to mention Dershowitz. If she was, there was the 
matter of the three hundred million dollars, and then some, that 
she would stand to gain. And the three hundred million or so 
that goes to set up a charity for battered women? If the scenario 
Dershowitz had thrown out was true, that would have been a 
genius move on Edwards's part—the sort of detail that helps the 
whole psychological picture fall into place. If Virginia felt guilty 
for lying about Dershowitz, she could think of the thousands of 
battered women she'd end up helping. 
269 
JAMES PATTERSON 
All these possibilities seemed bizarre. And yet everything 
connected with Epstein's story seemed to be bizarre. 
Bill Clinton got the use of a jet out of Epstein— a trip to 
Africa. But he and Epstein weren't bosom buddies. 
As for Prince Andrew, we already know how he feels about 
women. 
But what did Dershowitz get out of Epstein, aside from 
Epstein's wise counsel on all the books he'd written? 
One advantage Dershowitz had, as he laid out his argument, 
was that when it came to Jeffrey Epstein, all bets were off. He 
didn't have to establish his innocence. All he had to do was make 
sure that the waters stayed muddy. The more complicated things 
seemed to be, the better they were for Dershowitz. 
Thanks to Jeffrey Epstein's actions, and the endlessly compli-
cated cycle of suits and countersuits those actions inspired, 
those waters were very muddy indeed.

Scott Rothstein 
On October 27, 2009, Florida's governor, Charlie Crist, left Scott 
Rothstein a voice-mail message. 
Hey, Scott, the governor said. It's Charlie, your favorite 
Greek governor. Hope you're doing well, buddy. Just wanted to

twenty-fourth, and it is going amazingly well—unbelievable, 
brother.... Really enjoyed again seeing you and Kimmie and 
watch[ing] a little football and best to you guys from Carol and 
me. We love you. Take care. Bye-bye. 
That same day, Rothstein took a chartered Gulfstream V to 
Casablanca, Morocco. For a while, it seemed as if Rothstein was 
running. But a few days later, the same Gulfstream returned to 
Fort Lauderdale. The Ponzi king had decided to turn himself in. 
The moment he did, he started to sing like a canary in return 
for a lenient sentence. Rothstein gave up dozens of associates — 
the list included people at his law firm, law enforcement officers, 
271 
JAMES PATTERSON 
and his own wife, Kimmie, who was arrested for hiding more 
than one million dollars' worth of jewelry. 
All in all, more than thirty people involved in Rothstein's 
schemes were arrested and sentenced. 
Thanks, in part, to his cooperation with the feds, his was the 
only Ponzi scheme in history in which all the victims recovered 
their money. In return, Rothstein was put into a witness protec-
tion program and is serving his fifty-year sentence anonymously, 
in an undisclosed prison location. 
Alan Dershowitz 
On November 10, 2015, Alan Dershowitz arrived at Shriver Hall, 
on the campus of Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, to talk 
about the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
The outlines for peace are so obvious, he said. There has 
to be a two-state solution. 
Fifteen minutes into the talk, a group of women—students 
belonging to a group called Hopkins Feminists—stood up in 
protest. Dressed all in black, with duct tape over their mouths, 
they held up a sign and marched out of the hall. 
YOU ARE RAPE CULTURE, the sign read. 
Afterward, a reporter for the student paper asked Dershowitz 
about Jeffrey Epstein and Epstein's victims. Wasn't it true that Der-
showitz had implied that one of those victims was asking for it? 
I'm a defense attorney, Dershowitz replied. I have an obliga-
tion under the Constitution to provide a full and zealous defense to 
my clients. If I have failed to do all the things you had just listed, I - 
could be disbarred. I could be found incompetent as counsel.

He asked the reporter, Would any defense lawyer not look 
on the websites, look on social networks, find out what the 
woman who was accusing my client was doing? We were able to 
disprove many of the charges, just like how I was able to dis-
prove the charges against me. Falsely charging somebody with 
rape is a heinous thing to do. First of all, it creates horrors for the 
person who has been falsely accused. Second, it so hurts real 
rape victims because it makes it clear that some women lie for 
money. Our country, unlike others, requires that everybody be 
defended, and I'm going to continue to do that whether my cli-
ents are guilty or innocent. Let me tell you, most of my clients 
have been guilty. They deserve a zealous defense just as anybody 
else. I'm very proud of what I did for Jeffrey Epstein. If people 
don't like the fact that I got a 'good deal,' that's the job I do. 
The suits and countersuits Paul Cassell, Bradley Edwards, and 
Dershowitz filed against each other dragged on into the spring of 
2016 —reaching a crescendo with Dershowitz's argument about 
the plot to blackmail Les Wexner. But on April 8, all the parties 
involved agreed to settle, issuing a joint statement that read: 
Edwards and Cassell acknowledge that it was a mistake to have 
filed sexual misconduct accusations against Dershowitz; and the 
sexual misconduct accusations made in all public filings (includ-
ing all exhibits) are hereby withdrawn. Dershowitz also with-
draws his accusations that Edwards and Cassell acted 
unethically. Neither Edwards, Cassell, nor Dershowitz have any 
intention of repeating the allegations against one another. 
Dershowitz also hired former FBI director Louis J. Freeh to do 
an independent investigation. Freeh concluded that the evidence 
273 
JAMES PATTERSON 
his team reviewed refuted the accusations of sexual misconduct 
against Dershowitz. 
For Alan Dershowitz, the long nightmare he'd had to endure as a 
result of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein finally seemed to be over. 
Ghislaine Maxwell 
Trying to put her troubles with Epstein behind her, Ghislaine 
Maxwell took up a new calling. 
She's doing something to save the oceans now, a socialite says 
over the din of cocktail-party chatter at a private Palm Beach Club. 
Maxwell's nonprofit, the TerraMar Project, describes itself as 
a platform for citizenship and transformation of the high seas. 
Its focus is on cleaning up the eight million metric tons of plastic 
debris —garbage— that are dumped into the world's oceans 
each year. (Sources say that an earlier enterprise, the Seed Media 
Group, was funded by Jeffrey Epstein in 2005 to the tune of two 
million dollars.) 
Is anybody here staying awake at night because they're 
frightened about the ocean? she asks in 2014 at a TEDx talk in 
Charlottesville, Virginia. Are you scared about what could hap-
pen? Are you trying to think about what could you do that would 
help the ocean and all its myriad of troubles? 
But although her efforts on behalf of the environment are sin-
cere and articulate, Ghislaine still appears in the society pages. 
In 2010, she attends Chelsea Clinton's wedding in Rhine-
beck, New York.

International hosts Maxwell at a dinner cooked by the former 
chef for Madame Chiang Kai-shek. 
Sources say that Maxwell still maintains her warm relation-
ship with the Clintons. She was never charged with a crime. And 
Maxwell has repeatedly denied all allegations made by Virginia 
Roberts—and continues to do so today. Through her lawyer, 
Maxwell says she's had no connection to any criminal misconduct 
involving Virginia Roberts (or any other young woman) and Jef-
frey Epstein. She claims that Virginia's story about her experience 
as a sex slave has changed, significantly, over time— that with 
each telling, Virginia adds salacious details and names new public 
figures. Nevertheless, legal troubles for Maxwell recently began. 
In 2015, Virginia Roberts filed a defamation suit against the 
woman she says recruited her to work at Epstein's house on El Brillo 
Way. In January of 2016, Roberts filed additional papers, claiming 
that a defamation. suit filed against Bill Cosby, another alleged sexual 
predator, was directly relevant to her case against Maxwell. In March, 
Maxwell filed an answer in court denying all of Roberts's allegations 
and accusing Roberts of fabricating them for financial gain. 
As of this writing, the suit is ongoing. 
Prince Andrew 
In January of 2016, Sunninghill Park—the twelve-bedroom estate 
that Sarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew once shared in the 
English county of Berkshire—was bulldozed.

Prince Andrew had long since sold the home, which he and 
Sarah had received as a gift after their 1986 wedding. He got into 
hot water when it was revealed that the buyer, a Kazakh billion-
aire named Timur Kulibayev, had paid three million pounds 
more than the home's asking price. 
For her part, Sarah Ferguson announced that she was mov-
ing into a thirteen-million-pound ski chalet in Switzerland. 
It was a fitting end to the long, sometimes sordid story of the 
prince's marriage. But it was not the end of the scandals that 
seemed always to be swirling around the prince. 
On January 2, 2015, Virginia Roberts's allegations about her 
relationship with the prince—and the photo of him with his 
arm around Roberts's waist—appeared in the press. Prince 
Andrew was forced to cut short a skiing holiday to confer with 
his mother, the queen, and to issue a statement denying Rob-
erts's allegations—a step that was widely seen as being without 
precedent for a member of the royal family. 
That same month, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, 
Switzerland, the prince was again forced to reiterate and to reaf-
firm the repeated denials made by Buckingham Palace that he 
had any sort of sexual relationship with Roberts, who had 
announced in papers filed at the start of the year that Prince 
Andrew has a sexual interest in feet. 
My focus is on my work, Prince Andrew said at the time. 
Asked by a reporter, Will you be making a statement? the 
prince refused to answer. 
A few days later, Virginia Roberts signed a sworn statement in 
which she said, I did have sexual contact with him as I have 
described here—under oath. Given what he knows and has seen, 
I was hoping that he would simply voluntarily tell the truth about

under oath about the contacts and that he will tell the truth. 
According to several reports, Roberts's lawyers had written 
to .the prince, asking him to respond to her allegations in court. 
Reportedly, Buckingham Palace refused delivery of the letter. 
I knew he was a member of the British royal family, but I 
just called him 'Andy, Roberts had said in her statement. I got 
news from Maxwell that I would be meeting a prince. Later that 
day, Epstein told me I was meeting a 'major prince.' Epstein told 
me 'to exceed' everything I had been taught. He emphasized that 
whatever Prince Andrew wanted, I was to make sure he got. 
Signing her name to the document, Roberts wrote, I declare 
under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. 
That spring, Prince Andrew got a rare break: a federal judge 
in South Florida ordered that the allegations Roberts made be 
stricken from civil-court records. At this juncture in the pro-
ceedings, these lurid details are unnecessary, the judge con-
cluded. Once again, Buckingham Palace vehemently denied the 
prince's involvement in any activities, sexual or otherwise, per-
taining to Roberts. But that same year, reports leaked that the 
BBC program Panorama was working on an in-depth investiga-
tion into the prince's dealings with Epstein and Roberts. 
As of this writing, the investigation has yet to air. 
Barry Krischer 
I have no intention of being dragged into that conversation, 
Barry Krischer said in 2016 when contacted via telephone and 
asked about Jeffrey Epstein.

JAMES PATTERSON 
More than a decade had passed since Epstein's case first 
landed on the state attorney's desk. 
The New York Times has called me, said Krischer. The 
British papers. I'm not interested in being pulled into that con-
versation. I know that the police chief didn't think the case was 
handled right, but that's why he's a cop and I'm a prosecutor. 
Krischer, who left the state attorney's office in 2009, is still a 
member of the Criminal Justice Commission in Palm Beach 
County. Since his retirement, he's volunteered one morning a 
week at the office of the state attorney and two mornings a week 
at the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. 
He still remains active in child welfare issues, working with 
the Florida Department of Children and Families. 
Despite his continued involvement with local law enforce-
ment, he hasn't spoken to Michael Reiter in years. 
Bradley Edwards 
In December of 2009, Jeffrey Epstein filed suit, under Florida's 
RICO act, against Scott Rothstein, the jailed Ponzi king; Bradley 
Edwards, the lawyer who'd worked, briefly, in Rothstein's law 
firm, RRA, and represented several of Epstein's victims; and one 
of those victims, an individual referred to in the lawsuit as

dollars which, in turn, was used to fund the litigation against 
EPSTEIN for the sole purpose of continuing the massive Ponzi 
scheme. 
Moreover, the suit claimed, L.M. had testified she never had 
sex with Epstein; worked at numerous strip clubs; is an admitted 
prostitute and call girl; has a history of illegal drug use (pot, 
painkillers, Xanax, Ecstasy); and continually asserted the 5th 
Amendment during her depositions in order to avoid answering 
relevant but problem questions for her. (The suit made similar 
claims about two other victims.) According to the suit, L.M. had 
said only good things about Epstein when interviewed by the 
FBI in 2007, while being represented by another lawyer. Her 
story changed dramatically, the suit claimed, once she was in 
the hands of EDWARDS and RRA. 
In a motion for summary judgment filed by Bradley Edwards, 
Edwards denied all of these allegations, calling Epstein's claims 
frivolous for two separate reasons: On the one hand, Edwards 
claimed, Epstein was seeking damages from Edwards while 
asserting his own Fifth Amendment privilege to block the dis-
covery of relevant facts. (And, in fact, Epstein did plead the Fifth, 
dozens of times, when deposed by the lawyers of his victims.) 
On the other hand, Epstein's claims were directly contradicted 
by all of the record evidence. 
The truth in the record is entirely devoid of any evidence to 
support Epstein's claims and is completely and consistently cor-
roborative of Edwards's sworn assertion of innocence, the motion 
stated. 
279 
i 
JAMES PATTERSON 
Put simply, Epstein has made allegations that have no basis 
in fact. To the contrary, his lawsuit was merely a desperate 
measure by a serial pedophile to prevent being held account-
able for repeatedly sexually abusing minor females. Epstein's 
ulterior motives in filing, and prosecuting this lawsuit are 
blatantly obvious. Epstein's behavior is another clear demon-
stration that he feels he lives above the law and that because 
of his wealth he can manipulate the system and pay for law-
yers to do his dirty work—even to the extent of having them 
assert baseless claims against other members of the Florida 
Bar. Epstein's Complaint against Edwards and LM is nothing 
short of a far-fetched fictional fairy-tale with absolutely no 
evidence whatsoever to support his preposterous claims. It 
was his last ditch effort to escape the public disclosure 
by Edwards and his clients of the nature, extent, and sordid 
details of his life as a serial child molester. Edwards's 
Motion for Summary judgment should be granted without 
equivocation. 
Edwards filed a counterclaim for malicious prosecution. He 
sued me with knowingly made up, falsified facts,' Edwards says. 
And his sole motivation was to extort me into abandoning 
the legitimate cases I was pursuing against him on behalf of 
the victims, including the CVRA suit. He ultimately had to 
dismiss that case, literally on the morning our Summary 
Judgment was to be heard. I then sued him. We were set for 
trial. The judge granted me punitive damages in my claim.

our district ruled that my malicious prosecution claim can 
stand and the tort is not abolished in Florida. They sent it 
back to the trial court and Jeffrey Epstein appealed that to 
the State Supreme Court, and that's where that stands. 
Sarah Kellen 
She said her name was Clara something on the rental applica-
tion, says a real estate agent in Palm Beach. It wasn't until 
much later that I realized she was associated with Epstein. 
In April of 2009, that agent rented Clara a bungalow in Palm 
Beach. For Clara, that little home was a step down from Jeffrey 
Epstein's big house on El Brillo Way and from the life she'd known 
as Sarah Kellen. But not such a step down. She signed a lease to 
pay four thousand dollars a month from April 18 through July 18, 
2009, says a Palm Beach resident familiar with the local housing 
market. But she stayed a lot longer. And by the way, she went on a 
round-the-world trip for at least a month while she had the lease. 
Kellen had been a prime suspect in Chief Reiter's investigation. 
Prosecutors had considered charging her, Wendy Dobbs, and Nadia 
Marcinkova as potential coconspirators. They'd avoided those 
charges as part of the plea deal that Epstein had struck—a deal in 
the course of which it was suggested that if Epstein had to have 
pleaded to something, he could have pleaded to striking Kellen—or 
slapping her, once, on his jet. Assault, they'd have called it. 
281 
JAMES PATTERSON 
Kellen might have gone along with that. But in the end she 
didn't need to. Sources say she found another rich man as Epstein 
whiled away his hours in and out of the Palm Beach Stockade. 
She reinvented herself, and when her relationship with the 
wealthy man fell apart, she played the field until she met and 
married a race-car driver named Brian Vickers. Along the way 
she reinvented herself yet again, changing her name to Sarah 
Kensington. 
Nadia Marcinkova 
Nadia Marcinkova changed her surname to Marcinko and, after 
training at a Palm Beach flight school, became a commercial 
pilot and certified flight instructor. Calling herself Gulfstream 
Girl on Facebook, she cultivated her social media presence until 
2013, when the Gulfstream company filed a trademark infringe-
ment lawsuit against her. When the suit was settled out of court, 
in 2014, Marcinko changed Gulfstream to Global. 
As a child, she wrote for the About Me page on her web-
site, Nadia channeled her entrepreneurial spirit by selling invi-
sible pets to neighboring kids. She continued on to manage a 
successful family marketing business and soon she was disco-
vered by a modeling agency and immersed into the marketing 
and advertising world as a spokesperson and international fash-
ion model. 
There is no mention of Jeffrey Epstein. But on her YouTube 
channel, Marcinko appears in the cockpit of a Gulfstream II that 
looks very much like Epstein's Gulfstream, sitting beside a man 
who looks much like Larry Visoski, a pilot for Epstein.

One of the girls who gave Jeffrey Epstein massages moved to Los 
Angeles and became an actress, starring for a time in a soap 
opera and appearing in several films. She is now pursuing a 
career in country music. 
Several girls have been arrested for drugs, prostitution, and 
other nonviolent crimes. 
One girl is dead—murdered by her boyfriend for reasons 
that had nothing to do with Epstein. 
One of the girls who claimed to have been raped by Epstein 
is now a successful real estate broker in South Florida. 
Mary moved back in with her parents, finished high school, 
and attended college for a while. She had her ups and downs 
along the way. In 2010, she was arrested for shoplifting. But 
Mary, who was born in 1990, is still in her midtwenties —still

The Cops 
Michele Pagan is now a sergeant for the Palm Beach Police 
Department. 
In early 2012, at a reception at Mar-a-Lago, Detective Joe 
Recarey received the first Palm Beach Police Foundation Police 
Officer of the Year award—one of several honors he received in 
the course of his twenty-three-year career in Palm Beach. Two 
years later, he left the department and took a job as director of 
loss prevention for the Gold Coast Beverage company. 
I've been [at the Palm Beach Police Department] longer than 
my children have been alive, he told a reporter for the Palm 
Beach Daily News when he left. I'm going to miss a majority of 
the people I've worked with, and, obviously, I'm going to miss 
the work. This is my extended family. Like many families, you 
have disagreements with some family members. But you over-
look that, and you work together and you're a team. I'm going to 
look back and miss a lot of the people I've worked with. 
Palm Beach police chief Michael Reiter left the department in 
2008 after twenty-eight years on the job. He now runs his own 
security company in Palm Beach. 
Jean-Luc Brunel 
In January of 2015, Jean-Luc Brunel sued his old friend Jeffrey

Brunel is emotionally destroyed 
as a result of Epstein's actions and the resulting effects on his busi-
ness. He has been on medications to deal with the effects of this. 
It continues: Defendant Epstein recklessly inflicted emotional 
distress on Plaintiff Brunel by engaging in illegal conduct with 
under-aged girls, which was falsely linked to Plaintiff.... This ille-
gal conduct was extreme and outrageous by any standard. 
The suit went on to quote Bruners doctor, who said that the 
modeling scout had gone into psychotherapy due to a subjective 
sense of depression related to what he believes is a loss of business 
in his modeling agency as a result of slander published against his 
business. Brunel had gone on prescription drugs— Prozac, 
Rivotril— as a result. 
The fashion world had frozen him out, he said, after his relation-
ship with Jeffrey Epstein had become public. It had become impossi-
ble for him to find the fresh faces he needed for his agency, MC2. 
Brunel acknowledged Epstein's alleged crimes but denied his 
own involvement. Epstein's illegal activities were outrageous 
and extreme; they involved receiving massages from the under-
aged girls while the girls were nude or nearly nude; penetration 
of the girls with a finger or object; or full intercourse. 
When the Daily Beast reported the story and reached out to 
Brunel for a comment, the website's reporter was told, Jean-Luc 
is not in town; he's in South America. 
Bruners agency, MC2, is still in business.

EPILOGUE . 
When John Connolly, Tim Malloy, and I began work on 
this book, I had hoped to interview Jeffrey Epstein 
myself: to look directly into the eyes of the man we'd 
be writing about. Epstein declined to sit for an interview. Many 
of his friends and associates did speak with us on the condition 
that they not be quoted. Several of them still liked Epstein and 
made a point of telling us what a loyal friend he was—although, 
like Icarus, he seemed to have a fatal flaw. 
If Epstein had agreed to an interview, these are the questions 
I would have asked him: 
• You pleaded guilty to a single felony count of soliciting 
prostitution from a minor. Do you believe in your heart 
that you were guilty? 
• In 2011 you told the New York Post, I'm not a sexual 
predator, I'm an 'offender.' It's the difference between a 
murderer and a person who steals a bagel. Do you 
stand by that statement today?

I HAD BEEN HEARING HAIR-RAISING STORIES 
aboutJefftey Epstein for a couple qfyears. Our interests 
could not have been more different, but Palm Beach, 
where we both live, is small and tightly knit, and we 
knew some of the same people. So I had followed 
Epstein's case in the media and talked about it over 
dinners with friends. I wondered why it had taken 
so long for the Palm Beach police to catch up with 
Epstein. And, once they did, why he had served so 
little jail time. Those were the obvious questions, but 
there were others: How had Epstein made his money, 
possibly billions? No one seemed to know. 
Epstein had poweifitl friends. Were  his connec-

required a minimum of one month’s notice for foreign travel. By
making the request, he lessened the likelihood that it would arouse
undue suspicion when he departed for Hong Kong with stolen docu-
ments on May 18. This brief window left him some four weeks to
take the lists that he coveted.

Snowden carried out the heist with precision reminiscent of a
Mission: Impossible movie caper. First, he needed to get passwords to
up to twenty-four compartments at the National Threat Operations
Center that he had not been read into. Even in the “open culture”
of the NSA, this was not an easy challenge. He would be asking
one or more intelligence professionals to break strict NSA rules
that not only prohibited them from disclosing their passwords to an
unauthorized party such as himself but required them to report any
unauthorized person who asked to use their passwords. Remarkably,
he accomplished this incredible feat. He gained access to twenty-four
compartments containing the NSA’s most closely guarded secrets in
a matter of a few weeks.

Next, he had to find the lists he was seeking in a vast ocean of

© data. For this task, he used software applications called spiders to ©
crawl through the data and find the files he was after. He deployed
these robotic spiders, which presumably had been programmed in
advance, soon after he began working at the center. According to the
subsequent NSA damage assessment, Snowden’s spiders indexed
well over one million documents. Many of those that he copied and
moved were from Level 3 sensitive compartmented information,
according to the NSA analysis. The spiders also made his penetra-
tion relatively safe. As previously mentioned, the Hawaii base did
not have a real-time auditing system. So alarm bells did not go off in
the security office when he indexed documents.

Finally, Snowden had to find a way to transfer this data to a com-
puter with an opened USB port. This task was complicated by a secu-
rity precaution. Most of the computers at the center had had their
ports sealed shut to prevent unauthorized downloads. Making the
transfer even more difficult, he was working as an analyst in train-
ing in an open-plan office with closed-circuit security cameras. But it
was not impossible. System administrators sometimes used service
computers that had unsealed ports to back up data before they did

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018679.txt,"to go into therapy, but I wanted a Kink Aware therapist who wouldn't shame me for my
S&M preferences. The specific therapist I preferred was out-of-network for my health
insurance, which meant I needed help paying for it. My dad was cool with it, but he didn't
say much. My mother paused when I told her... and then she explained that S&M is part
of her sexuality, too.

I was shocked. I was also incredibly relieved. If my brilliant, independent mother was
into S&M, then suddenly I felt much more okay about being into it myself. It turned out
that she had explored S&M late in life -- and she went through the same anxiety about
feminism and S&M that I'd felt. You're not giving up your liberation,” she told me.

Mom also acknowledged the stereotype that S&M arises from abusive experiences. I
once worried that being raped made me into S&M, she said. But I remember having
S&M feelings in my childhood and early teens, long before I was raped. I was like this all
along. When she said that, I caught my breath in recognition.

This is another topic I often repeat myself about, but that's because it's important. As it
happens, the biggest and best-designed study on S&M found that there is no correlation
between abusive experiences and being into S&M. There's also plenty of anecdotal
evidence within the S&M community that a lot of S&Mers, though not all, feel our S&M
identities to be innate (sometimes described as an orientation). This is not to say that
there's anything wrong with understanding or processing abuse through consensual S&M.
The psychologist Peggy Kleinplatz once published a scholarly article called Learning
From Extraordinary Lovers: Lessons From The Edge, which discusses how therapists
can help their clients by studying alternative sexualities. Kleinplatz included a case study
of a couple whose S&M experiences helped them process their histories of abuse.
However, abusive experiences should not be seen as the usual creator of S&M desires.
(For more on this, check out my article on S&M and the psychiatric establishment.)

The stereotype that S&M comes from abuse is another reason I worried about writing
this article. Basically, this is a prettily-wrapped gift to Internet commentators who enjoy
writing posts or hate mail about how fucked up I am, or about how dysfunctional S&M

is. I guess there's no help for that.

KK Ok

I'm fascinated that you've adopted feminism so thoroughly, my mother told me once. I
never felt like I was into feminism like you are.

What? I said. Are you serious?”

Well, feminism shaped my life,” she said. I really had my consciousness raised by
some of my experiences. Not just being raped, but by other things, like seeing the anger
and resentment among my mother and her sisters. Feminism helped me understand how
women compete and put each other down because we're put in that position by men who
have power over us. Sometimes, we're like animals who have been starved into fighting
for scraps.

But, my mother continued, I've never been sure about calling myself a feminist. There
have always been a lot of feminist areas I didn't feel welcome. Your dad was a card-

focus on him as the sole perpetrator of the leak so that no one else at
the NSA would be suspected.

Poitras and Gellman were not the only journalists involved in
the news event. Poitras also asked Appelbaum to help her interview
Snowden about the NSA’s operations. She later said that she needed
someone with technical expertise in government surveillance to test
the bona fides of Citizen Four. She believed that Appelbaum, who
had participated in her anti-NSA presentations in 2012, qualified for
the position.

Snowden previously had contact with Appelbaum. Appelbaum
had communicated with Snowden under his Oahu CryptoParty alias
about an obscure piece of software just a few weeks after Snowden
had met with Runa Sandvik in Hawaii in December 2012. Appel-
baum, in fact, had worked with Sandvik as a core developer of Tor
software. Snowden allowed Appelbaum to put detailed questions to
him concerning the secret operations of the NSA before he met with
Poitras and Greenwald in Hong Kong. Indeed, Poitras joined him
in asking Snowden via encrypted e-mails such questions as “What

© are some of the big surveillance programs that are active today ®
and how do international partners aid the NSA?” “Does the NSA
partner with other nations, like Israel?” and “Do private companies
help the NSA?” Snowden answered all the questions to the satis-
faction of Appelbaum and Poitras. (The interview was published on
July 8, 2013, with Snowden’s approval on the website of Der Spie-
gel, the German weekly, which had also published the WikiLeaks
documents.)

As the days ticked away while Snowden was waiting for Green-
wald in Hong Kong, Greenwald was awaiting a green light to go
there from Janine Gibson, the editor of the Guardian website, who
was based in New York. Under Gibson’s leadership, The Guardian's
website had effectively “gone into the business of publishing gov-
ernment secrets,” as the Guardian columnist Michael Wolff pointed
out. Most of the documents had been supplied by Bradley Man-
ning via WikiLeaks. Few if any of these previous documents The
Guardian published were highly classified, and none were SCI top
secret documents. The NSA documents Greenwald had received

ASK
Due to the funding decrease UNFPA is experiencing as the US pulled all their funding under president Trump, and the European countries have re-directed their funding to deal with the migrant influx, there is a funding shortfall leading to Female Condom stock outs in countries. 

The Female Health Company is looking for donors who are willing to donate money to UNFPA, and earmark that money for purchase of the FC2 female condom only, so that they can purchase the FC2 female condom for the following countries:
Uganda : 3 million units		Ghana: 1 million units

Sierra Leone: 500,000 units		Bolivia: 500,000 units
Tanzania: 1 million units		Haiti: 500,000 units
Ethiopia: 1 million units		Congo DR: 2 million units

Why Female condoms?
The female condom is the only female initiated method that provides triple protection against STIs including HIV and Zika and against unplanned pregnancy
Introduction of male and female condoms in the same market leads to more overall protected sex acts
Cost effective, positive return on investment

                    
                    







HIV/AIDS global overview
• No. 1 cause of death globally for women age 15-44
• 80% of female cases contracted via heterosexual transmission
• Male and female condoms are the only prevention products available

                                        Worldwide, women represent >50% of new  
                                        Adult HIV/AIDS infections
                    
                    







The social case for FC2
Empowering women as a development tool by decreasing maternal mortality & fewer unwanted pregnancies and protecting from HIV-infection, and other STIs

  ▪ Worldwide 215 million women who like to plan or limit number of children have no access to contraception
  ▪ Worldwide 21.6 million unsafe abortions cause 5 million women hospitalized each year, and account for 13 % of maternal deaths
  ▪ Worldwide women and girls account for slightly more than half of all HIV infections
  ▪ In sub-Saharan Africa 23 million people live with HIV/AIDS: over 12 million are women and nearly 2.5 million are children

                    
                    







The product case for fc2
Only FDA and WHO approved Female Condom and as a result approved for bulk procurement by UNFPA and USAID
The strong preference for FC2 due to its non allergenic material nitrile and long standing reputation
FC2 is has been distributed to 144 countries. 
The backup support, materials, training provided by FHC

                    
                    







The product case for fc2 (2)
5) The FC2 female condom, as opposed to the latex male condom, is made out of Nitrile which holds many benefits: 
- Three times stronger than latex, 
- Can be used by people who are latex sensitive, or allergic
- Can hold both water and oil based lubricants (latex tears with oil)
- Can be inserted hours in advance 
- Transfers body heat ensuring a more natural sensation

6) The FC2 is hormone free, which means that it does not have the side effects of  some hormone based contraceptives.

7) Preferable alternative to a male condom, according to males
▪ Men don’t have to wear it
▪ Not tight/restricting
▪ Can be inserted in advance of sexual activity



                    
                    







Debunking myths & Misconceptions
Certain Myths and Misconceptions among decision still exist today, even though the evidence tells otherwise

It is too expensive
There is no demand
We already have male condoms and LARCs so the FC is not necessary
Men do not like the product, and without them it will never succeed
                    
                    







1) It is too Expensive: false
                    “The Business Case for Female Condoms” 
                    (Global Health Visions, 2014)

Return on investment of female condom procurement for governments through 2 ways:
Cost savings to the health system, by focussing on prevention instead of treatment
Economic productivity losses averted, as more women are able to join the workforce. 

                    
                    







The business case for female condoms (2)
	The Business case for female condoms found that for every $1,- invested in buying female condoms in Kenya a return of $1,94 is made. In Nigeria for every $1,- invested a return of $3,20 is made. See table below for health benefits. 

                    
                    







2) There is no demand: False
Uruguay Study, UNFPA Uruguay and MOH Uruguay (2017):

3) We already have other commodities: False
AIGHD Research on the Female Condom in Mozambique (2017)
                    The increase in female condom use was not accompanied by an
                    off-setting decrease in ever or current use of alternative methods.
                    If anything, current use of male condoms and other modern
                    contraceptives increased slightly in the treatment group. Female condoms thus seemed to complement the existing choice set of regular contraceptives

South Africa National Female Condom Program Evaluation (2017)
                     Of the current FC users 73,4% reported using condoms in general more often than before they started using the female condom. 



                    
                    







4) Men do not like the product: false
South Africa National Female Condom Program Evaluation (2017)


- At their one month interview 58% of men said that the FC was better or much better than the MC and at 12 months this rose to 74%
- At six months into the research 97% of women reported that their partners were supportive of using the FC

                    
                    







In summary
Female Condoms provide a return on investment
Female Condoms are in high demand with both men and women, average and key populations
Female Condoms increase the overall use of barrier methods and contraceptives, enforcing  decrease in overall number of unprotected sex acts

¢ Federal prosecutors made the unprecedented demand that Mr. Epstein pay a
minimum of $150,000 per person to an unnamed list of women.they referred to as
minors and whom they insisted required representation by a guardian ad litem, Mr.
Epstein’s counsel later established that all but one of these individuals were actually

- adults, not minors. Even then, though demanding payment to the women, the
USAO eventually asserted that it could not vouch for the veracity of any of the
claims that these women might make.

s Federal prosecutors made the highly unusual demand that Mr. Epstein pay the fees
of a civil attorney chosen by the prosecutors to represent these alleged “victims”
should they choose to bring any civil litigation against him. They also proposed
sending a notice to the alleged “victims,” stating, in an underlined sentence, that
should they choose their own attorney, Mr. Epstein would not be required to pay
their fees. The prosecutors further demanded that Mr. Epstein waive his right to
challenge any of the allegations made by these “victims.”

« The Assistant U.S. Attorney involved in this matter recommended for the civil
attorney, a highly lucrative position, an individual that we later discovered was
closely and personally connected to the Assistant U.S. Attorney’s own boyfriend.

« Federal prosecutors represented to Mr. Epstein’s counsel that they had identified
‘(and later rechecked and re-identified) several alleged “victims” of federal crimes
that qualified for payment under 18 U.S.C. § 2255, a civil remedy designed to
provide financial benefits to victims. Only through state discovery provisions did
we later learn that many of the women on the rechecked “victim list” could not
possibly qualify under § 2255. The reason is that they, themselves, testified that
they did not suffer any type of harm whatsoever, a prerequisite for the civil recovery
under § 2255. Moreover, these women stated that they did not, now or in the past,
consider themselves to be victims.

e During the last few months, Mr. Herman, First Assistant Sloman’s former law
pariner, has filed several civil lawsuits against Mr. Epstein on behalf of the alleged
“victims.” It is our understanding that each of Mr. Herman’s clients are on the

My mother was summoned to my high school so often that some of the students thought she
worked in the principal’s office. One day, after I had done something especially egregious—I
threw a “dummy” dressed like me off the roof of the building, after threatening to “jump off the
roof’ when my teacher threw me out of the class'*—the principal demanded of my mother “what
are we going to do with your son?” Without any hesitation my mother responded, “I don’t know
what you’re going to do, but as for me, I’m going to keep him.” The principal threatened to send
me to another school called “R.J.J.,” which we always said, stood for “Reformatory for Jewish
Juveniles,” because some of the tougher kids—the disciplinary “problems”—went there. (The
initials really stood for “Rabbi Jacob Joseph’). Ultimately I was suspended for a few weeks on
the ground of “lack of respect” and spent them at the local library and museum, where I learned
considerably more than I was learning in my classes.

It was not my first suspension, nor would it be my last. Nor would it be my first encounter with
my principal, Rabbi Zuroff, who in my senior year, when he was finally resigned to my remaining
in the school until graduation, called me to his office for some career advice. This is what he told
me: “You have a good mouth, but not much of a ‘Yiddisher Kup,’” which means ‘Jewish head’
or brain, as distinguished from a Goyisher (non-Jewish) Kup”—a slightly bigoted concept
suggesting that Jews are endowed with special mental qualities or capacities.’* He continued:
“You should do something where you use your mouth, not your brains.” I asked him what he
would suggest. He replied: “You should become either a lawyer, or a Conservative Rabbi.” (He
was an Orthodox Rabbi who held his Conservative colleagues in utter contempt.) To make sure
the latter part of his advice was followed, he urged Yeshiva University, which trained Orthodox
Rabbis, to reject me, which it did.

My classmates as well valued my verbal over my intellectual skills. The first draft of my high
school yearbook description said that I have “a mouth of Webster, but a head of clay.” (My
mother made them change it!)

Rabbi Zuroff’s career advice was actually better than the choices given to me by the New York
City Department of Employment, to which my mother turned in desperation. After reviewing my
high school record, and administering an aptitude test, the counselor told my mother that I could
aspire to work in an advertising firm or a “funeral parlor.” My mother asked whether I could be a
lawyer, to which the counselor replied, “Mrs. Dershowitz, I’m afraid you have to go to college to
be a lawyer, and your boy just isn’t college material.”

Many years later, following a talk I gave at a temple in Los Angeles, a man about my age came up
to me and asked whether I was “related to a guy I went to high school with named Avi
Dershowitz.” “Avi” was the Hebrew nick-name by which I was known all through high school. I
began to use my “real” name, Alan, when I started Brooklyn College, though my old friends and
family still call me Avi.

I decided to put the questioner on, so I said, “yeah, yeah, we are related.”

8 The classic Jewish joke reflecting this xenophelia is about Moishe who says to his wife, “It’s too hard to be a
Jew. I’m converting to Christianity.” He goes to church, converts and goes home to sleep. Next morning his wife
wakes up and sees Moishe wearing his Talit (Jewish prayer shawl) while davening (praying in Hebrew). “What
are you doing Moishe,” she asks, “You’re a Christian.” Moishe replies, “I forgot! Goyisher Kup.”

Karpoff’s survey, another dictate of participants’ (and the judges’) property rights
intuitions was who owned the land on which the lost item was found.

Also like animals, our sense of property rights is influenced by who created or
invested in the resource, another uncorrelated asymmetry. In locales that sometimes
grant property rights to squatters—individuals who occupy lands others have pur-
chased—a key determinant of whether the squatters are granted the land is whether
they have invested in it (Cone vs. West Virginia Pulp & Paper Co., 1947; Neuwirth,
2005). Locke also intuited that investment in land is part of what makes it ours:
In Second Treatise on Civil Government (1689), Locke wrote, “everyman has a
property in his person; this nobody has a right to but himself. The labor of his body
and the work of his hand, we may say, are properly his.”

If the Hawk—Dove model underlies our sense of property rights, we would expect
to see psychological mechanisms that motivate us to feel entitled to an object when
we possess it or have invested in it. Here are three such mechanisms, which can be
seen by reinterpreting some well-documented “biases” in the behavioral economics
literature. The first such bias is the endowment effect: We value items more if we are
in possession of them. The endowment effect has been documented in dozens of
experiments, where subjects are randomly given an item (mug, pen, etc.) and
subsequently state that they are willing to sell the mug for much more than those
who were not given the mug are willing to pay (Kahneman, Knetsch, & Thaler,
1990). In the behavioral economics literature, the endowment effect has sometimes
been explained by loss aversion, which is when we are harmed more by a loss than
we benefit from an equivalent gain. However, the source of loss aversion is not
questioned or explained. When it is, loss aversion is also readily explained by the
Hawk—Dove game (Gintis, 2007).

A second bias that also fits the Hawk—Dove model is the IKEA effect: Our valu-
ation of an object is influenced by whether we have developed or built the resource.
The IKEA effect has been documented by asking people how much they would pay
for items like Lego structures or IKEA furniture after randomly being assigned to
build them or receive them pre-built. Subjects are willing to pay more for items they
build themselves.

A third such bias that fits the Hawk—Dove model is the sunk cost fallacy (Mankiw,
2007; Thaler, 1980), which leads us to “throw good money after bad” when we
invest in ventures simply because we have already put so much effort into them,
arguably because our prior efforts lead us to value those ventures more.

Possession and past investment are not the only uncorrelated asymmetries that
can dictate rights. Rights can be dictated by a history of agreements, as happens
when one party sells another deed to a house or car, or, as in our taxicab example,
by whether a service was provided. There are also countless examples in which
rights were determined by perhaps unfair or arbitrary characteristics such as race
and sex: Black Americans were expected to give up their seat for Whites in the Jim
Crow South and women to hand over their earnings or property to their husbands
throughout the ages.

Hawk-—Dove is not just a post hoc explanation for our sense of rights; it also leads
to the following novel insight: We can formally characterize the properties that

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021254.txt,"The science of the mind is not
unique in this regard. As the historian
Daniel Boorstin (1983, /) noted:

Nothing could be more obvious
than that the earth is stable and
unmoving, and that we are the
center of the universe. Modern
Western science takes its
beginning from the denial of this
commonsense axiom...
Common sense, the foundation
of everyday life, could no longer
serve for the governance of the
world. When “scientific”
knowledge, the sophisticated
product of complicated
instruments and subtle
calculations, provided
unimpeachable truths, things
were no longer as they seemed.”

(p. 294)

And just as the observation that we roam
on stable ground led to the incorrect
inference that we are the center of the
universe, so too is the modern notion
that the human brain is a solitary,
autonomous instrument whose
connections with other brains is a matter
of deliberate choice and of no real
import.

The human brain, the organ of
the mind, is housed deep within the
cranial vault, where it is protected and
isolated from others, so it may seem
obvious that the brain is a solitary
information processing device that has
no special means of connecting with
other brains. But we are fundamentally
a social species. Faces, expressive
displays, and human speech receive
preferential processing in neonate as
well as adult brains. When a person
feels rejected by others, their brain
shows the same pattern of activation as
when they are exposed to a physically

painful stimulus. Permit a person to
cooperate with others, and their brain
shows the same pattern of activation as
when they are given a rich reward such
as delicious food or drink. We may not
be aware of it, but human evolution has
sculpted a human need for social
connection, along with neural circuits
and hormonal processes that enable and
promote communication and connection
across brains. As we shall see in the
chapters to follow, our sociality is an
important part of who we are as a
species and it plays an important though
often invisible role in the operations of
our brain and our biology. Among the
questions we examine is whether our
social brain also contributes to the
ubiquitous human quest for spirituality.

The Chicago Social Brain Network

For hundreds of years, theology
and philosophy were the hub disciplines
of scholarship, and other fields of
inquiry orbited around this dyad and
were tightly constrained by it. Over the
past three centuries, the sciences have
come into their own, displacing theology
and philosophy at the center of the
academic universe. In so doing, they
have produced extraordinary advances in
everyday life. People may reminisce
about the good old days, but thanks to
science and technology the amount of
total income spent on the necessities of
food, clothing, and shelter dropped from
80% in 1901 to 50% in 2002/2003. Yet
there remains an inchoate sense that
something is missing in our lives,
something intangible and elusive.
Science has improved our material lives,
but improvements in material life may
not be enough to optimize human well
being.

what would constitute a fair agreement. He was presenting it on a take-it-or-leave-
it basis. If either side said no, he would withdraw it, and it would not be binding on
President Bush.

He proceeded to lay out his proposal. It now envisaged the Palestinians ending
up with between 95 and 97 percent of the West Bank. Israel’s military presence in
the Jordan Valley would be for a maximum of six years, after which our soldiers
would be replaced by an international force. On refugees, the solution Clinton
proposed would “make it clear there is no specific right of return to Israeli itself”
but recognize “the aspiration of the Palestinian people to return to the area.” He
proposed a joint endorsement by Israel and the Palestinians of the right of refugees
to return to a new Palestinian state. In Jerusalem, Arafat would have sovereignty
over the entirety of the Old City except for the Jewish Quarter and, of course, the
Western Wall and the “holy space of which it is a part.” Finally, the President said,
this would be a final peace: an end of conflict and, once implemented, an end to
any further claims. He wanted replies from Israel and the Palestinians within five
days. Dennis added that, while both sides could come back with reservations, if
any of these fell outside the substantive limits of President Clinton’s parameters,
the response would be interpreted as a “no” and our search for an agreement would
be over.

Clinton’s latest proposals went beyond even what I was willing to have him
keep in his pocket at Camp David. Opposition politicians in Israel, and even a few
of our cabinet ministers, promptly objected to the formula for Jerusalem. I told the
critics — as I knew I’d have to argue to the country in a referendum, in the
vanishingly unlikely event we actually reached an agreeement — that making peace
was not like making love. It was something you did with enemies. I, too, would
have preferred to say no to Clinton’s ideas on Jerusalem. But to reject them would
have placed Israel in the position of rejecting the entire Clinton paper, something I
was not prepared to do.

I sent word to the President that we accepted his ideas. We did raise
reservations — twenty-eight in all, about how various parts of the agreement would
work on the ground. But none fell outside his parameters for a peace agreement. At
first Arafat asked the Americans for more time. Then he went to Washington to see
Clinton. There, he presented his “reservations”. They were not just outside the
Clinton parameters. They rejected two key elements. Arafat said there could be no

highly enriched uranium for medical use rather than approach the amount
needed for a bomb, leading Israeli authorities to predict that Iran wouldn't
be able to build a bomb before 2015 or 2016. Last week, Ali Akbar
Velayati, Khamenei's foreign policy advisor, publicly criticized officials
who have treated the negotiations dismissively. Presumably, he was
thinking of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has compared Iran's
nuclear program to a train without brakes.

Iran is now at the outset of what promises to be a raucous presidential
election, and may be no more capable of serious negotiations between now
and June than the United States was in 2012. But what is clear is that the
sanctions have moderated Iranian behavior and rhetoric. At the same time,
as the Times also noted, the economic pressure is not nearly great enough
to compel concessions that the regime would view as a blow to national
pride. In short, Iran might -- might -- be more willing to accept a face-
saving compromise than they were a year or two ago, but will need serious
inducements to do so.

What would that entail? Virtually all the proposals that have come from
outside experts suggest that the P5+1 begin with modest confidence-
building measures, especially in the period before the election. A recent
report by the Arms Control Association enumerates several of them.
Western diplomats, for example, could take up Ali Akbar Salehi, Iran's
foreign minister, on his proposal to limit the extent of enrichment -- 1.e.,
well below 20 percent -- in exchange for fuel rods for the research reaction
and a recognition of Iran's right to enrich, a notional concept the United
States already supports under specified conditions. Or Iran could suspend
20-percent enrichment in exchange for a suspension of new sanctions. But
Iran is unlikely to accept even such small steps unless it felt that additional
moves would win additional explicit concessions.

Beyond that, the outlines of what in Middle East peacemaking is known as
final status are clear enough: Iran agrees to verifiable inspections to
ensure that it does not enrich uranium beyond 3.5 percent and does not
pursue a nuclear weapons program, while the West accepts Iran's right to
enrich and dismantles sanctions. Of course, the outlines of a Middle East

What is Blockchain Technology?
Investment
Management
Division
Illustrative Schematic: Centralized Network versus Distributed Network
Centralized Network
Distributed Network
• Blockchain is the critical and differentiating infrastructure that underlies cryptocurrencies.
• Unlike most networks today, which rely on a centralized hub, a blockchain is a public distributed network whose
complete database can be accessed and maintained by each member of the network.
• The blockchain is a shared and continually reconciled database. As new transactions occur, data is quickly
disseminated to, verified, and incorporated across all nodes on the network.
• Because it has no single maintainer, the blockchain’s history is resistant to editing by a malicious actor.

Common Features of Cryptocurrencies
Common Features of
Cryptocurrencies
� Digital
Attributes
• Coin ownership is represented by entries on a digital
ledger, not by a physical token.
� Decentralization • No single entity controls the currency.
� Open Source • All source code is available freely online.
� Distributed
Consensus
� Pseudonymity
� Cryptography
(computerized encoding)
• Each cryptocurrency uses a method for obtaining
consensus on ownership without a central arbiter.
• Coin ownership is not linked to real-world identities
within the blockchain.
• Several cryptographic techniques are used to verify
transactions, protect identities, and limit supply.
• A cryptocurrency is a decentralized digital coin. It allows users to make transactions and store money in a secure and
pseudonymous manner.
• All cryptocurrency transactions are recorded chronologically on a blockchain, which acts as the critical infrastructure
underlying a cryptocurrency.
• The process of verifying transactions and ensuring the validity of the blockchain is called “mining.”
• Mining solves the “double-spending” problem that had plagued previous attempts to implement a digital currency.

1) Before sending any bitcoins, Bob must hold bitcoins
in his wallet from a previous transaction (or by
solving a block to earn the mining reward).
2) Bob creates a new transaction in which he pays 0.5
BTC (of his 1 BTC) to Alice.
3) Bob broadcasts this transaction to the network for
validation and inclusion in the blockchain.

1) Miner B happens to be the first to solve this block

2) If Bob’s transaction is included the block, Alice
becomes the owner of 0.5 BTC, which will register
in her wallet.
• Consensus transaction validation creates a book of record for all transactions that have ever occurred.
– Transactions may only occur if they are supported by evidence from previous transactions.
– To send bitcoins, an owner’s wallet uses its private key to prove ownership of the referenced bitcoins.
• Transaction processing typically take 10-20 minutes, but can take up to 18 hours if the network is congested.

• Miners use highly specialized computers designed to run an algorithm that attempts to solve a cryptographic puzzle in order
to add a new block on the blockchain. By design, a bitcoin block is created once every ten minutes.
• The computing power required to solve the cryptographic puzzle is high and expensive; bitcoin mining consumes an
estimated $1.3bn worth of electricity annually 1 —equivalent to Ireland’s annual electricity consumption.
• In order to incentivize mining, the first miner to complete a block is rewarded 12.5 bitcoins. The global supply of bitcoins is
capped at 21mil (currently ~16.5m) and follows a predetermined growth rate—the miners’ rewards halve every four years.
• Given ~1-1.5m mining units globally, the likelihood of any one miner solving a block is low. Many miners join “mining
pools,” which are cooperatives which share block rewards proportionate to contributed mining power.
– Mining pools are highly concentrated; the top four pools represent over 50% of total mining power.

• New blockchain-related projects are funded via an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). This process raises capital through token sales.
• In an ICO, the object offered is either a new digital coin or a yet-undeveloped concept in search of funding. ICO investors
purchase an ownership percentage of a future money supply or functionality.
• While many ICOs support legitimate use cases, Autonomous Research asserts, “unfortunately, many ICOs are fraudulent.” 1
• Rather than raising fiat currency, ICOs primarily raise capital in the form of Bitcoin and Ether, driving additional demand for
the cryptocurrencies.

• In addition to speculation, which has been the biggest driver of cryptocurrency appreciation, other drivers include:
• Perceived Scarcity: Bitcoin’s 21 million token cap is expected to be reached in 2140 (16.5 million today). Many of the
over 2,000 other cryptocurrencies, however, do not have a capped supply. Further, while unlikely, bitcoin’s token cap
could be raised if a consensus of programmers decided so.
• Desired Safe-haven: Increased global participation reflects desire for an asset independent from governments or central
banks (“digital gold”). Many governments from which investors have sought diversification, however, have recently
banned domestic crypto-exchanges.

Larry Fink on Bitcoin’s Illicit Use
Bitcoin just shows you how much demand for money
laundering there is in the world. That’s all it is. It’s an
index of money laundering.”
– BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, October 13, 2017
• Because bitcoin is pseudonymous, not anonymous, users’ real-world identities are ascertainable once the individual
converts bitcoin to fiat currency.
• Digital intelligence companies continually scan the blockchain to identify suspicious transaction activity.
• The Blockchain Intelligence Group estimates that illegal transactions in bitcoin fell from ~50% of total volume in 2015
to ~20% in 2016, and represent “significantly less than that” today.
• As law enforcement has become better able to track bitcoin ransom, cybercriminals have begun to favor currencies that
allow anonymity, such as Monero and Zcash, and even Ether.

Sovereign Currencies Meet Three Criteria

1) They are used as a medium of exchange.
– To represent a medium of exchange, an instrument must facilitate the transaction
of goods or services between parities (US$ are used to buy a barrel of oil).
2) They serve as unit of account.
– A unit of account is a measurement which allows value to be accounted and
compared (a barrel of WTI is worth ~$55).
3) They are a store of value.
– A store of value is an asset that can be saved, stored, and exchanged in the future
for a predictable stable value (with 2% annual inflation, a nominal dollar today
will be worth 82¢ in 10 years).

• Processing is slow. Transaction processing typically takes a minimum of 10-20 minutes, but can take up to 18 hours if
the network is congested (Visa and Mastercard authorize transactions in ~20 milliseconds).
• Bitcoin is not broadly accepted. A mere 9k merchants accept bitcoin, compared to the 37mil that accept Visa and
MasterCard, and the billions of merchants and people globally that accept US dollars. 1
• Further, the IRS considers all cryptocurrency gains a taxable event (including for de minimis purchases).

• Bitcoin’s annualized volatility of 95% dwarfs even the most volatile of EM currencies.
• Bitcoin’s volatility is 8x the volatility of US equities. In terms of both count and magnitude, Bitcoin, Ether and Ripple have all
experienced more severe drawdowns over their short histories than the S&P 500 has since 1945.
• Bitcoin exchanges have thin liquidity, which plays a role in driving enormous price movement—so far to the upside, but which
could cause a flash crash upon a large sell order. A ~$30 million sell order would likely move the market by 5%.
• A store of value should predictably preserve wealth. Bitcoin is unable to do so, as it neither generates income nor grows with

• Although cryptocurrencies cannot be spent without control of the corresponding private keys, care must be taken to
protect those private keys. Many bitcoin owners allow exchanges to custody their private keys, which leaves them
vulnerable:
– If hackers are able to access owners’ private keys, they can deplete owners’ digital wallets.
– As of August 2016, Reuters reported that a third of bitcoin exchanges had been hacked. 1
– Ethereum’s recent Parity hack is the first time a coding error has resulted in a loss of funds.
• Estimates vary but suggest that hackers have stolen at least several hundred million dollars of cryptocurrencies.

1. Central Bank Current State 2. Illustrative Potential State: Central Bank Cryptocurrencies
• Sovereign central banks have begun exploring cryptocurrency options.
• A retail central bank cryptocurrency would effectively give the public access to accounts at the central bank with the
ability to transfer payments peer-to-peer.
• Cryptocurrency proposals are being considered by several central banks, including Singapore’s MAS, China’s PBOC,
Russia’s Central Bank, Sweden’s Riksbank and Ecuador’s Banco Central.
• A successful central bank cryptocurrency could substantially reduce fraud and tax evasion.

“Say there’s a grant to Nigeria for health stuff—if it’s digital money, they can track that it
was paid to a certain person and when it was paid out. Then you can audit later and say,
‘Did that really happen?’ You don’t want to tell donors that three percent went astray. Now
that there’s digital traceability in a place like Nigeria, where corruption is a huge problem,
we can bring that down. A lot of the optimism we have at the foundation about disease,
education and financial services is because we’re sitting on top of a digital miracle.”

• Blockchain technology, which underlies cryptocurrencies, is revolutionary, and likely
to have many applications.
• Cryptocurrencies are currently too volatile to be a medium of exchange, unit of
account, or store of value, and have many vulnerabilities.
• The cryptocurrency ecosystem will evolve substantially over time.
• The current incarnation of cryptocurrencies is unlikely to persist, but we expect
central bank digital currencies to prevail.

Entities Providing Services. This material has been approved for issue in the United Kingdom solely for the purposes of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets
Act 2000 by Goldman Sachs International, Peterborough Court, 133 Fleet Street, London EC4A 2BB; by Goldman Sachs Canada, in connection with its distribution in

In Australia, this document, and any access to it, is intended only for a person that has first satisfied Goldman Sachs that: the person is a Sophisticated or Professional
Investor for the purposes of section 708 of the Corporations Act of Australia; and the person is a wholesale client for the purpose of section 761G of the Corporations Act of
Australia. To the extent that Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (GSCo), Goldman Sachs (Asia) L.L.C. (GSALLC), and/or Goldman Sachs International (GSI) are providing

Investment Risks. Risks vary by the type of investment. For example, investments that involve futures, equity swaps, and other derivatives, as well as non-investment
grade securities, give rise to substantial risk and are not available to or suitable for all investors. We have described some of the risks associated with certain investments
below. Additional information regarding risks may be available in the materials provided in connection with specific investments. You should not enter into a transaction or
make an investment unless you understand the terms of the transaction or investment and the nature and extent of the associated risks. You should also be satisfied that
the investment is appropriate for you in light of your circumstances and financial condition.
• Money Market Funds. Investments in money market funds are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other
government agency. Although money market funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by
investing in money market funds.
• U.S. Registered Mutual Funds / ETFs or Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs). A Prospectus and, if available, a summary prospectus for the applicable
mutual fund, ETF or ETN containing more information may be obtained from your Private Wealth Management team. Please consider a fund's
investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses, and read the summary prospectus or the Prospectus carefully before investing, as they contain
this and other information about the mutual fund.
31
Important Information
Investment
Management
Division
You may obtain documents for ETFs or ETNs for free by 1) visiting EDGAR on the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/; 2) contacting your Private Wealth Management
team; or 3) calling toll-free at 1-866-471-2526. Unlike traditional mutual funds, ETFs can trade at a discount or premium to the net asset value and are not directly
redeemable by the fund.
You should understand the risks associated with leveraged or inverse ETFs, ETNs or commodities futures-linked ETFs before investing. These types of securities may
experience greater price movements than traditional ETFs and may not be appropriate for all investors. Most leveraged and inverse ETFs or ETNs seek to deliver
multiples of the performance (or the inverse of the performance) of the underlying index or benchmark on a daily basis. Their performance over a longer period of time
can vary significantly from the stated daily performance objectives or the underlying benchmark or index due to the effects of compounding. Performance differences may
be magnified in a volatile market. Commodities futures-linked ETFs may perform differently than the spot price for the commodity itself, including due to the entering into
and liquidating of futures or swap contracts on a continuous basis to maintain exposure (i.e., “rolling”) and disparities between near term future prices and long term future
prices for the underlying commodity. You should not assume that a commodity-futures linked ETF will provide an effective hedge against other risks in your portfolio.
• Alternative Investments. Alternative investments may involve a substantial degree of risk, including the risk of total loss of an investor’s capital and the use of leverage,
and therefore may not be appropriate for all investors. Private equity, private real estate, hedge funds and other alternative investments structured as private investment
funds are subject to less regulation than other types of pooled vehicles and liquidity may be limited. Investors in private investment funds should review the Offering
Memorandum, the Subscription Agreement and any other applicable disclosures for risks and potential conflicts of interest. Terms and conditions governing private
investments are contained in the applicable offering documents, which also include information regarding the liquidity of such investments, which may be limited.
• Emerging Markets and Growth Markets. Investing in the securities of issuers in emerging markets and growth markets involves certain considerations, including:
political and economic conditions, the potential difficulty of repatriating funds or enforcing contractual or other legal rights, and the small size of the securities markets in
such countries coupled with a low volume of trading, resulting in potential lack of liquidity and in price volatility.
• Equity Investments. Equity investments are subject to market risk, which means that the value of the securities may go up or down in respect to the prospects of
individual companies, particular industry sectors and/or general economic conditions. The securities of small and mid-capitalization companies involve greater risks than
those associated with larger, more established companies and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements.
• Fixed Income. Investments in fixed income securities are subject to the risks associated with debt securities generally, including credit/default, liquidity and interest rate
risk. Any guarantee on an investment grade bond of a given country applies only if held to maturity.
• Non-US Securities. Investing in non-US securities involve the risk of loss as a result of more or less non-US government regulation, less public information, less liquidity
and greater volatility in the countries of domicile of the issuers of the securities and/or the jurisdiction in which these securities are traded. In addition, investors in
securities such as ADRs/GDRs, whose values are influenced by foreign currencies, effectively assume currency risk.
• Real Estate. Investments in real estate involve additional risks not typically associated with other asset classes, such as sensitivities to temporary or permanent
reductions in property values for the geographic region(s) represented. Real estate investments (both through public and private markets) are also subject to changes in
broader macroeconomic conditions, such as interest rates.
• Structured Investments. Structured investments are complex, involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Investors in structured investments assume the credit risk
of the issuer or guarantor. If the issuer or guarantor defaults, you may lose your entire investment, even if you hold the product to maturity. Structured investments often
perform differently from the asset(s) they reference. Credit ratings may pertain to the credit rating of the issuer and are not indicative of the market risk associated with the
structured investment or the reference asset. Each structured investment is different, and for each investment you should consider 1) the possibility that at expiration you
may be forced to own the reference asset at a depressed price; 2) limits on the ability to share in upside appreciation; 3) the potential for increased losses if the reference
asset declines; and 4) potential inability to sell given the lack of a public trading market.
32
Important Information

Options. Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. The purchase of options can result in the loss of an entire investment and the risk of uncovered options
is potentially unlimited. Please ensure that you have read and understood the current options disclosure document before entering into any standardized options
transactions. The booklet entitled Characteristic and Risk of Standardized Options can be obtained from our sales representatives or at
http://www.theocc.com/components/docs/riskstoc.pdf. Transaction costs may be significant in option strategies that require multiple purchases and sales of options, such
as spreads. Supporting documentation for any comparisons, recommendations, statistics, technical data, or other information will be supplied upon request.
• Buying Options - Investors who buy call (put) options risk loss of the entire premium paid if the underlying security finishes below (above) the strike price at
expiration.
• Selling Options - Investors who sell puts risk loss of the strike price less the premium received for selling the put.
OTC Derivatives. To understand clearly the terms and conditions of any OTC derivative transaction you may enter into, you should carefully review the Master Agreement,
including any related schedules, credit support documents, addenda and exhibits. You may be requested to post margin or collateral at levels consistent with the internal
policies of Goldman Sachs to support written OTC derivatives.
Prior to entering into an OTC derivative transaction you should be aware of the below general risks associated with OTC derivative transactions:
– Liquidity Risk: There is no public market for OTC derivative transactions and, therefore, it may be difficult or impossible to liquidate an existing position on
favorable terms.
– Risk of Inability to Assign: OTC derivative transactions entered into with one or more affiliates of Goldman Sachs cannot be assigned or otherwise transferred
without Goldman Sachs’ prior written consent and, therefore, it may be impossible for you to transfer any OTC derivative transaction to a third party.
– Counterparty Credit Risk: Because Goldman Sachs may be obligated to make substantial payments to you as a condition of an OTC derivative transaction, you
must evaluate the credit risk of doing business with Goldman Sachs. Depending on the type of transaction, your counterparty may be Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, a
registered U.S. broker-dealer, or other affiliate of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. As a broker dealer regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”), Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC is subject to net capital, financial responsibility rules, and other regulatory requirements designed to protect customer assets.
Other subsidiaries of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. may not be registered as a U.S. broker dealer and therefore are not be subject to similar SEC regulation.
– Pricing and Valuation: The price of each OTC derivative transaction is individually negotiated between Goldman Sachs and each counterparty and Goldman Sachs
does not represent or warrant that the prices for which it offers OTC derivative transactions are the best prices available. You may therefore have trouble establishing
whether the price you have been offered for a particular OTC derivative transaction is fair. OTC derivatives may trade at a value that is different from the level
inferred from interest rates, dividends and the underlyer. The difference may be due to factors including, but not limited to, expectations of future levels of interest
rates and dividends, and the volatility of the underlyer prior to maturity. The market price of the OTC derivative transaction may be influenced by many unpredictable
factors, including economic conditions, the creditworthiness of Goldman Sachs, the value of any underlyers, and certain actions taken by Goldman Sachs.
– Early Termination Payments: The provisions of an OTC derivative transaction may allow for early termination and, in such cases, either you or Goldman Sachs
may be required to make a potentially significant termination payment depending upon whether the OTC derivative transaction is in-the-money at the time of
termination.
– Indexes: Goldman Sachs does not warrant, and takes no responsibility for, the structure, method of computation or publication of any currency exchange rates,
interest rates, indexes of such rates, or credit, equity or other indexes, unless Goldman Sachs specifically advises you otherwise.

Cannabis Investment Report | December 2017

fies other PVPA requirements may apply for and receive a certificate of plant variety protection issued
by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Such a certificate establishes a breeder's right, for a
period of time and subject to certain exceptions, to exclude others from selling the variety, offering it
for sale, reproducing it, importing or exporting it, or using it in producing a hybrid or different variety.
A breeder's rights under the certificate last for 20 years (25 years in the case of a protected tree or vine)
from the certificate’s issue date.

It is not clear whether the USDA has issued any certificate of plant variety protection for a can-
nabis variety. The USDA website provides a searchable database of certificates issued since February
2013, as well as a schedule of crop categories for which certificates have been issued. A search of these
USDA materials indicated that no certificates for varieties of cannabis, marijuana or hemp have been
issued. The PVPA defines “variety” as “a plant grouping within a single botanical taxon of the lowest
known rank” with certain defining and distinguishing features. Given the disagreement among bota-
nists regarding cannabis taxonomy noted in Chapter I, Cannabis Science 101, it may be challenging
to demonstrate that a cannabis variety satisfies PVPA criteria for protection.

Trademark Act

A trademark is a word, name, symbol or device used by a person to identify and distinguish the person's
goods or services from the goods and services of others and to indicate the source of the goods or ser-
vices. Trademarks take many forms, including logos, slogans, symbols, colors and sounds. Under com-
mon law and through registration under state and federal statutes, a trademark owner can be afforded
certain legal protections against unauthorized use of the trademark by others.

Trademark protection under federal law is provided primarily by the Trademark Act, also known
as the Lanham Act, which provides for registration of trademarks with the USPTO. The holder of a
federally registered trademark receives certain rights and protections under federal law, including the
right to use the “®” symbol, evidence and nationwide notice of a claim of ownership, access to federal
courts for dispute resolution, the ability to prevent importation of foreign goods that infringe on the
trademark, and the right to recover certain statutory damages and attorneys’ fees. Generally, federal
registration is the most comprehensive trademark protection available in the United States.

Federal trademark registration requires “lawful” use of the trademark in commerce. Thus, trade-
marks used to identify, distinguish or indicate the source of cannabis or related products or services
that are illegal under federal law are not eligible for federal registration. However, federal registration is
available for trademarks used in connection with federally legal cannabis-related products or services,
such as a recipe for food intended to be infused with cannabis or a cannabis-related clothing line.

Alternatives to federal trademark registration include protections available under common law and
through registration under state trademark statutes. Common law protections vary across jurisdictions
and generally extend only to geographical regions where a trademark has first been used in commerce.
State trademark registration generally provides protection within the entire state but, like federal regis-
tration, may not be available for trademarks used in connection with unlawful subject matter.

Pardon the formality below - I want to approach your very legitimate questions / concerns in a serious 
manner. 
Attached and below the same. 
Dear Jeffrey: 
As requested, the following addresses your two questions / concerns about our proposed Closer To Truth TV 
series The Science of Sleep and Dreams: 
(i) Have there been sufficient breakthroughs in Sleep and Dreams (significantly beyond traditional 
understandings) to justify a major TV series? 
(ii) Even if 'yes' to (i), is now the proper time for such a foundational series, or are more years needed for 
corroborative studies and further research to solidify the breakthroughs? 
In preparing this response, my primary source is Professor Patrick McNamara, Department of Neurology, 
Boston University School of Medicine, with whom CTT Producer/Director Peter Getzels and I spoke with at 
length today. Patrick is one of the leading sleep and dream researchers (he himself more dreams). More 
importantly, he is perhaps the leading chronicler of the field, with many publications (including 26 entries in 
related encyclopedias). He is co-editor-in-chief of the Encyclopedia of Sleep and Dreams (2012) and 
the sole author of the forthcoming An Introduction to the Neuroscience of Sleep and Dreams (Cambridge 
University Press, 2018), which intends to present the latest science and to become a main textbook for 
graduate courses/seminars. Patrick is a CTT contributor and colleague. 
When we asked Patrick, his first response — This is the ideal time to tell the sleep-and-dreams story — and he 
cited (in essence) your two questions, in that (i) the multiple breakthroughs are now sufficiently well 
corroborated by numerous independent labs such that a substantial foundation for the new, deeper 
understanding of sleep and dreams is now for the first time (over the past few years) confirmed and 
established, and (ii) there are now interesting application and critical clinical questions to pose, explore and 
pursue, such as for the treatment of various mental-related illnesses that have known sleep-related syndromes 
(e.g., PTSD and Depression). 
To understand the significance of recent breakthroughs, a defining characteristic of sleep and dreams is that 
there are two distinct kinds of sleep — REM (rapid-eye-movement) Sleep and NREM (non-rapid-eye-
movement) Sleep. Most dreams are associated with REM sleep (though complex). The eye movement 
gives the eponymous name, but a more important designation defines the two stages in terms of brain waves 
(electroencephalograph — EEG): REM is Fast-Wave Sleep (similar to the waking state) and NREM Sleep is 
Slow-Wave Sleep (very different from the waking state). This difference between REM and NREM sleep has 
been known since 1953 (different EEGs since 1937), but its deep significance has only been discovered and 
confirmed in very recent years (as explained below). 
Following are the key areas of breakthrough in sleep and dreams (from Patrick). Patrick states that these are 
now reproducible, non-controversial, and well-accepted among experts, although still not appreciated by the 
public - hence the high value of our CTT TV series. The organizing idea is why and how are sleep and dreams 
essential for normal memory consolidation and bodily health / well-being. 
Memory Consolidation. There is a fundamental difference between REM and NREM Sleep for memory 
consolidation: REM is for emotional memories, whereas NREM is for declarative and procedural memories. 
Hence, understanding and dealing with REM emotional memories can lead to treatment for the many 
neuropsychiatric illnesses that have sleep/dream-related disorders or syndromes (Parkinson's Disease, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025106 
Anxiety, Substance Abuse, many sleep disorders such as Nightmare Disorder, etc., in addition to PTSD and 
Depression). Research shows bi-directional causality between neuropsychiatric disorders and sleep disorders. 
This is a superb example of how fundamental science breakthroughs lead to clinical breakthroughs. This fact 
that REM is associated with emotional memories is nicely consistent with the apparent psychotic nature of 
dreams, because in REM Sleep the frontal cortex is 'down-regulated' (and the frontal cortex is associated with 
rational planning, reflection, controlling impulses), while in REM Sleep the limbic system is 'up-regulated 
(and the limbic system is associated with emotions and feelings) — see Neuroimaging below. This is 
why dream states flood the ego with emotional fantasies without rational control. However, it is also true that 
the limbic system enables creative ideas, thus grounding in science the long-suspected idea that sleep and 
dreams can enhance creativity. 
As Dr. Robert Stickgold, our other advisor on the series, wrote: It would be nice if we could talk about sleep 
and memory as if there were only one type of memory and one type of sleep. But this is far from the case. 
Sleep and memory each comes in many forms, and furthermore, memories can go through multiple forms of 
post-encoding processing that must be individually addressed. 
Immunity / Immune System. Strengthening the immune system is now a proven product of NREM sleep. 
Discerning the evolutionary basis for this is a key research project (i.e., it seems counter-intuitive 
that sleeping facilitates fitness for survival in that predators lurked in the jungles and on the plains so that 
going unconscious during sleep does not, at first glance, seem especially adaptive). Studies of sleep in various 
non-human animals reveals a direct relationship between longer periods of NREM (Slow-Wave) Sleep and a 
stronger immune system, especially in fighting parasites. NREM Sleep releases molecules that 
fight inflection; NREM Sleep works for the maintenance, repair and activation of the immune system. (This 
gives scientific rationale for the need or desire to sleep during illnesses.) Related are genetic conflict studies 
with respect to REM and NREM, showing differences in heredity between material and paternal lines, and 
differences between males and females in which genes get imprinted. 
Neuroplasticity. Exciting recent research has reversed the century-long conventional wisdom that new 
neurons are never created in adult animals/humans. The development of new neurons — neuronogenesis — is a 
vital part of maintaining normal brain and mental functioning. New neurons are being created, importantly, in 
the hippocampus (brain organ where new memories are encoded) — but, remarkably, the neuronogensis in 
the hippocampus occurs only/largely during REM Sleep — a stunning finding. This is another reason why 
REM sleep is needed for emotional memory consolidation (normal functioning). 
Dream-Content. Although dreams have sparked human fascination and fantasy for thousands of years, only 
in very recent years, have large-scale surveys been conducted with rigorous design, classifications and 
statistical analysis. Literally hundreds of thousands of dreams are enabling statistically significant theories, 
including cross-cultural analyses (similarities and differences). Dream-posting sites have revolutionized size 
and structure of dream data sets. This enables, for the first time, longitudinal studies of dreams over time. 
Patterns are repeated. For example, in general, the dreams of males and females differ in fundamental ways. 
Males will engage in fighting with other males; females with both males and females. Male dreamers 
are often the initiator of fights and the fights are usually physical. Females fight verbally. Aggressiveness 
by the dreamer is almost always in REM Sleep, rarely in NREM Sleep. (Why is a continuing question.) 
Lucid Dreaming is a new area of fascinating research. Lucid Dreaming is where the dreamer knows that 
he/she is dreaming while dreaming (a talent that a small minority possesses but more can be 
trained/developed). Lucid dreamers, while sleeping, can now communicate with experimenters by altering 
their brain activity and thus becoming detectable by neuroimaging techniques (see below). 
Neuroimaging. Finally, neuroimaging technology has enabled many of these breakthroughs. As such, it is 
itself a methodological breakthrough that has enabled these other content breakthroughs. Neuroimaging now 
enables detailed location of the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of REM and NREM Sleep. In 
REM Sleep, the dorsolateral, frontal cortex is down-regulated, whereas the limbic system is up-regulated, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025107 
showing the physiological basis for the emotional, wild-fantasies of dreams (see above). (Neuroimaging will 
enable good visual images for the TV series without extra costs.) 
Patrick stresses that while these breakthroughs form, for the first time, a solid foundation for understanding 
sleep and dreams, they also open opportunities to dig deeper into the purpose of sleep and dreams, as well 
as engender a new series of questions and directions (e.g., clinical treatments of illnesses). 
Attached is Patrick's quick compiling of summaries of a few recent leading research papers (2009 — 2017, 
especially 2015-2017). 
You'd enjoy speaking with him, if you want. 
Love to do this series together with you.

We will continue to watch each development in the U.S. and E.U. closely to understand if

governor’s mansion is a populist argument against big tech.

regulatory news. By all accounts, Facebook has continued to bleed

good faith and is not intended as a general fishing expedition.
Because of this governing law, I proposed that Rule 17 should itself identify restrictions on a defendant's ability to subpoena
confidential information. My proposal incorporates specificity, relevancy, and admissibility components - conforming with,
rather than altering, existing law. My current proposal 7°° requires the information be specifically described and admissible at
trial - and it bars evidence sought for impeachment purposes only. In contrast, the Advisory Committee seemingly enlarges the
substantive rights of defendants by failing to reference even a single Nixon factor in its proposal. Thus, unless a court takes it
upon itself to ensure the relevancy, specificity, and admissibility of the subpoenas, [*912] the Advisory Committee proposal
might provide the defendant with license to conduct the very fishing expedition that Nixon forbids.

The proposed Advisory Committee Note adds to this confusion. The Note indicates that in considering whether to issue the
subpoena, the court should consider the relevance of the subpoenaed material to the defense. 78! But this is an overly broad
formulation. The court should only consider the relevance of the material to the defense at trial, since this is the only
permissible basis for a subpoena.

Current law clearly limits Rule 17 subpoenas to evidence that is admissible at trial. 2°? The reason for Nixon's limitations of
relevance, admissibility, and specificity is that subpoenas are not intended to provide a means of discovery for criminal cases
but only to expedite the trial by providing a time and place before trial for the inspection of subpoenaed materials. 78? With
regard to admissibility, Nixon explained that generally, the need for evidence to impeach witnesses is insufficient to require its
production in advance of trial. 784 In other words, documents sought for the narrow purpose of impeachment are not
evidentiary for the purposes of Rule 17. 7°° In Nixon, only because the prosecutor made a sufficient preliminary showing that
the subpoenaed tapes contained evidence admissible with respect to the offenses charged in the indictment and that the
evidence could be validly used as nonimpeachment evidence, did the Court find the evidence to be subpoenable. 78°

Courts apply Nixon's admissibility test strictly, rejecting, for example, subpoenas for hearsay evidence that would be
inadmissible at trial. 78” The cases have recognized that broad subpoenas run afoul of these limitations - including subpoenas
seeking information about crime victims. 7°* For example, in United States v. Hang, the Eighth Circuit affirmed the district

279 Id. at 699-700 (citing United States v. Iozia, 13 F.R.D. 335, 338 (S.D.N.Y. 1952)).

280 My earlier proposal specifically required that no subpoena would issue without a finding by the court that the information is relevant to
trial. Cassell, Proposed Amendments, supra note 4, at 875 (emphasis added). In view of the importance of the Nixon factors, it now seems
desirable to spell them all out, as my current proposal does.

following the vote by the Dutch parliament to support Ukraine’s Association

NATO has also shown strong support to Ukraine by providing various forms of
assistance through advice and training to strengthen its defence by building
stronger security structures. The Ukrainian defence industry may also get
permission to participate in tenders for the supply of goods and services for NATO.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029966.txt,"Those arguments seem to have made an impression, because government officials repeated many of
them at this week's hearings. The Homeland Security Committee invited representatives of three
federal agencies to testify before the committee this week. Jennifer Shasky Calvery represented the
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which enforces the nation's laws against money laundering.
Mythili Raman spoke on behalf of the Justice Department, whose enforcement activities have
included the shuttering the Bitcoin-based drug marketplace Silk Road. And Edward Lowery spoke for
the Secret Service, which (along with the Justice Department) was involved in shutting down e-Gold
and Liberty Reserve, two virtual currencies that the government alleged had become vast money-
laundering operations. Calvery also testified before the Senate Banking committee on Tuesday.
Virtual currencies have yet to overtake more traditional methods to move funds internationally for
criminal purposes, Calvery said. She pointed out that the Bitcoin network has processed only about
$8 billion worth of transactions over the last year, compared to an estimated $1.6 trillion in global
criminal proceeds in 2009. Clearly, the vast majority of those transactions are using some other
financial network.

We are attuned to the criminal use of Bitcoin, Raman said. But there are many legitimate uses.
These virtual currencies are not in and of themselves illegal.

Calvery agreed. Innovation is a very important part of our economy, she said, cautioning that
premature regulation could stifle Bitcoin innovation.

The personal touch

Regulators are busy people. They're more likely to pay attention to flesh-and-blood advocates than to
anonymous Internet commenters. Murck and Andresen's trip to Washington proved to be crucial to
building productive relationships with policymakers.

Calvery was a keynote speaker at the June conference. Murck and Calvery met in the speakers' room
at the conference and had a conversation that would later lead to the closed-door August meeting
between regulators and Bitcoin advocates. The day after the June conference, Murck was introduced
to staffers on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, beginning a conversation that culminated in
this week's hearings.

Murck says that not everyone in the Bitcoin community was happy about his engagement with
Washington. The Bitcoin community has a strong libertarian streak, and many Bitcoin devotees
wotried that conversations with federal regulators could help to legitimize and encourage regulation.
But to the surprise of many, the Bitcoin advocates’ charm offensive actually changed the minds of
many D.C. insiders. Winning over Allen was a particular coup for the Bitcoin community. Allen's
warnings against the dangers of premature regulation were particularly effective coming from a long-

time activist against child pornography.

broadly, this refers to the property via which distance in syntactic space (distance between
the syntactic structure of programs, e.g. if they’re represented as program trees) and se-
mantic space (distance between the behaviors of programs, e.g. if they’re represented as
sets of input/output pairs) are reasonably well correlated. This can often happen among
sets of programs that are not too widely dispersed in program space. The Reduct library
is used to place Combo programs in Elegant Normal Form, which increases the level of
syntax-semantics corellation between them. The programs in a single MOSES deme are
often closely enough clustered together that they have reasonably high syntax-semantics
correlation.

e System Activity Table: An OpenCog component that records information regarding
what a system did in the past.

e Temporal Inference: Reasoning that heavily involves Atoms representing temporal in-
formation, e.g. information about the duration of events, or their temporal relationship
(before, after, during, beginning, ending). As implemented in CogPrime, makes use of an
uncertain version of Allen Interval Algebra.

e Truth Value: A package of information associated with an Atom, indicating its degree
of truth. SimpleTruthValue and IndefiniteTruthValue are two common, particular kinds.
Multiple truth values associated with the same Atom from different perspectives may be
grouped into CompositeTruthValue objects.

e Universal Intelligence: A technical term introduced by Shane Legg and Marcus Hutter,
describing (roughly speaking) the average capability of a system to carry out computable
goals in computable environments, where goal/environment pairs are weighted via the length
of the shortest program for computing them.

e Urge: In OpenPsi, an Urge develops when a Demand deviates from its target range.

e Very Long Term Importance (VLTI): A bit associated with Atoms, which determines
whether, when an Atom is forgotten (removed from RAM), it is saved to disk (frozen) or
simply deleted.

e Virtual AGI Preschool: A virtual world intended for AGI teaching/training/learning,
bearing broad resemblance to the preschool environments used for young humans.

e Virtual Embodiment: Using an AGI to control an agent living in a virtual world or game
world, typically (but not necessarily) a 3D world with broad similarity to the everyday
human world.

e Webmind AI Engine: A predecessor to the Novamente Cognition Engine and OpenCog,
developed 1997-2001 — with many similar concepts (and also some different ones) but quite
different algorithms and software architecture

argued that Obamacare was basically an expansion of insurance coverage and did not

emphasize patient health enough.

In an interview with The Washington Post in November, he said his office had already

been in touch with Trump's transition team offering help.

“We're really talking about replace and repair, rather than repeal. But we haven’t seen
a full approach yet from the administration. Personally, this is me speaking. ... We’re

basically optimistic we can create a better system together,” Noseworthy said.

In a statement issued by his office shortly after the meeting began, Noseworthy said
the invitation from Trump was to share his perspective on the future of healthcare

delivery, research and excellence” and that he was pleased for the opportunity.”

Rothman is chief executive of Johns Hopkins Medicine and several years ago found
himself in the awkward position of criticizing physician Ben Carson, who at the time
was head of pediatric neurology for the institution, after he made disparaging remarks
about same-sex marriage. Carson later apologized publicly for his “poorly chosen
words.” Carson, a onetime political rival of Trump's, has been tapped to lead

the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Torchiana is chief executive of Partners HealthCare, based in Massachusetts — a state
that has long been at the forefront of health-care reform. Partners operates two of the
most well-regarded hospitals in the world, Massachusetts General and Brigham and
Women's Hospital, which are affiliated with Harvard Medical School. But in recent
months, Partners has been under fire from some policymakers because of what they
describe as a large gap between what Partners charges and what other providers

charge.

Cosgrove, a heart surgeon and Vietnam veteran who is chief executive of the Cleveland
Clinic, may be a candidate for the head of the Department of Veterans Affairs,
according to Bloomberg News. Cosgrove has met with Trump several other times. He's
on an advisory panel of 16 executives for the president-elect on jobs and the economy,
has been spotted in Trump Tower recently and was in Palm Beach meeting with

Trump last week.

°° Leading observers view this structural reform as insufficient to address the scope of the police-misconduct problems. See id. at 59-61
(describing injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. § /4/4/, noting limits on data about police misconduct, and explaining how insufficient data
limits the effectiveness of reform efforts). On the prospect of reduced federal commitment to this strategy in the Trump administration, see
U.S. Attorney Gen., supra note 24; Horwitz et al., supra note 24.

197 See Dripps, supra note 149, at 19 & n.100 (citing five federal actions under § 14141 addressing local agencies' responses to sexual assault
crimes).

198 That is, federal criminal law is effective at successful prosecutions, if not at reducing the underlying social problem targeted by criminal
law. See generally, e.g., Steven B. Duke & Albert C. Gross, America's Longest War: Rethinking Our Tragic Crusade Against Drugs (1993)
(examining and critiquing American drug policies).

199 See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 241 (2012) (criminalizing conspiracy); id. § 242 (criminalizing willful deprivation of federal rights while acting
under color of law); id. § 249 (criminalizing willful bodily injury because of victim's race, religion, sexual orientation, or gender identity).
Federal prosecutors focus on other serious direct-victim crimes as well, such as human trafficking and child pornography. See U.S. Dep't of
Justice, supra note 145 (describing prioritization of such cases). But federal involvement in that realm is presumably motivated not so much
by a need for oversight of untrustworthy state prosecutors as by the greater resources, expertise, and interstate jurisdictional advantages that
federal prosecutors bring to such cases. Criminal prosecution is only one aspect of federal policies to reduce custodial deaths and improper
uses of force by police. Other strategies include investigating abuse and corruption in local police agencies and using civil injunctive
remedies against those agencies to change patterns of wrongdoing, as well as gathering data on custodial deaths and police uses of force. See
Harmon, Policing Reform, supra note 21; Simone Weichselbaum, Policing the Police: As the Justice Department Pushes Reform, Some
Changes Don't Last, Marshall Project (May 26, 2015), https:/Avww.themarshallproject.org/2015/04/23/policing -the-police (describing the
difficulties in achieving lasting reforms in local police departments through federal consent decrees).

200 See 18 U.S.C. § 242 (liability for an official who willfully subjects any person ... to the deprivation of any [federal] rights); United
States v. Screws, 325 U.S. 91, 103 (1945) (interpreting § 242's willfulness term to require specific intent to deprive a person of a federal
right).

201 The prosecution of South Carolina police officer Michael Slager provides an example. State prosecutors charged Slager with murder;
federal prosecutors charged him with criminal violation of civil rights under 18 U.S.C. § 242. For an example of this contrast between state
and federal charges for the same offense, see Blinder, supra note 52; Michael S. Schmidt & Matt Apuzzo, Officer Is Charged with Murder of

Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment

The Rohrabacher-Farr amendment, first passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President
Obama in 2014, prohibits the DOJ from using federal funds to prevent a state from “implementing”
state laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession or cultivation of medical marijuana.

Following the amendment’s initial 2014 enactment, the DOJ indicated that it did not plan to arrest
state regulators for “implementing” a state’s medical marijuana laws but would continue to prosecute
individuals involved in state-law compliant medical marijuana activity because, in the DOJ’s view, the
amendment did not apply to prosecutions against individuals.

The DOJ’s interpretation of the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment was rejected by a Ninth Circuit
District Court in its 2015 ruling in United States v. Marin Alliance for Medical Marijuana, and again by
the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in its 2016 ruling in United States v. McIntosh. The Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals held the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment prohibits DOJ from spending funds subject
to the amendment on the prosecution of individuals who fully comply with state medical marijuana
laws. The court noted a state’s “implementation” of medical marijuana laws necessarily involves “giving
practical effect” to those laws, and that DOJ prosecution of individuals complying with those laws
prevents the state from giving the laws practical effect.

The Rohrabacher-Farr amendment generally applies only to DOJ funds made available pursu-
ant to the federal budget legislation in which the amendment is included, and therefore must be
renewed periodically with budget legislation to remain effective. The Rohrabacher-Farr amendment
was recently renewed in December 2017 as part of an emergency aid package that remains effective
until mid-January 2018. (With the retirement of Representative Samuel Farr from the U.S. Congress
in 2016, the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment is now also referred to as the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer
amendment; we use this name elsewhere in this report.)

Agricultural Act of 2014

The Agricultural Act of 2014 (Farm Bill) authorizes institutions of higher education and state depart-
ments of agriculture to cultivate industrial hemp, CSA controls notwithstanding, if (i) the industrial
hemp is cultivated for purposes of research conducted under an agricultural pilot program or other
agricultural or academic research and (ii) the cultivation is allowed under the laws of the state in which
such institution of higher education or state department of agriculture is located and such research
occurs.

The Farm Bill defines “industrial hemp” as the cannabis plant and any part of such plant, whether
growing or not, with a THC concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.
Industrial hemp, like any cannabis plant, may comprise both marijuana (as defined in the CSA) and
non-marijuana. But the Farm Bill creates an exception to CSA controls on marijuana, so cultivation in
accordance with the Farm Bill of marijuana that qualifies as industrial hemp does not violate the CSA.

The following table summarizes the legal relationship between marijuana (as defined in the CSA)
and industrial hemp (as defined in the Farm Bill).

years was reasonable). Prince Mohamed
correctly submits that his position as an
officer of DMI, IICG, and FIBS would not
be a basis for jurisdiction over him even if
the Court had personal jurisdiction over
these entities. See Keeton v. Hustler
Magazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770, 781 n. 18,
104 S.Ct. 1478, 79 L.Ed.2d 790 (984)
(“Each defendant’s contacts with the fo-
rum State must be assessed individually.”).
Finally, Prince Mohamed argues that the
conclusory allegation that he participated
in a terrorist conspiracy, without specific
facts, is insufficient to create personal ju-
risdiction over him.

[60] The Court agrees that Plaintiffs
have not presented a prima facie case of
general jurisdiction over Prince Mohamed.
In the ten years before the attacks, Prince
Mohamed’s contacts with the United
States consist of one speech and a handful
of investments in the United States
through the banks with which he is affiliat-
ed. These contacts are not sufficiently
“systematic and continuous” to maintain
general jurisdiction over a defendant in
this action.** See Helicopteros, 466 U.S. at
416, 104 S.Ct. 1868 (holding that purchas-
ing in forum, sending personnel for train-
ing in forum, and negotiating a contract in
forum were not sufficient to establish gen-
eral jurisdiction).

[61,62] Plaintiffs have alleged that
DMI and FIBS might have been involved
in the financing of terrorism. See, ¢.g.,
Ashton Complaint 19 274-75; Ashton Opp.
at 25. Even assuming that the Court has
personal jurisdiction over these entities,
“[t]he mere fact that a corporation is sub-
ject to jurisdiction ... does not mean that
individual officer may be hauled before
New York courts without any showing that
the individuals themselves maintained a

presence or conducted business in New
York.” Family Internet, 1999 WL 796177,
at *4. Plaintiffs have not alleged that
Prince Mohamed had any knowledge or
involvement in any al Qaeda accounts at
any of the banks he chaired. FIBS’ rela-
tionship with Al Shamal Islamic Bank,
which purportedly knowingly opened ac-
counts for al Qaeda operatives, including
Osama bin Laden, is too remote in time
and proximity to implicate Prince Mo-
hamed. To make a prima facie case of
personal jurisdiction, Plaintiffs must either
allege personal acts by Prince Mohamed
by which he purposefully directed his ac-
tivities at the United States by supporting
Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda, or their ter-
rorist agenda, or demonstrate that the acts
of the banks he chaired can be imputed to
him. Plaintiffs have not met their burden.
Thus, Prince Mohamed’s motions to dis-
miss the Ashton and Federal complaints as
against him for lack of personal jurisdic-
tion are granted.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026556.txt,"DURING THE RULE OF WESTERN-ORIENTED autocrat Mohammad Reza Shah
Pahlavi, Tehran was a rapidly evolving society that deceptively appeared to be crossing
into the modern age. My own family history is perhaps representative of Iran's urban
middle-class trajectory during the 20th century: My devout paternal grandmother, born in
1907, wore a chador and wasn't formally educated beyond elementary school; three of her
four daughters attended university, and all eschewed the veil. All of their daughters grew
up in a Tehran in which miniskirts were the trend, and Googoosh -- Iran's pre-
revolutionary J. Lo (but remarkably modest by today's standards) -- was their main

source of emulation.

Khomeini's opposition to the shah was fueled in part by the latter's enfranchisement of
women, which the ayatollah deliberately conflated with sexual decadence. In his 1970
book Islamic Governance(Hukumat-e Islami) -- which would later provide the ideological
and political template for post-revolutionary Iran -- Khomeini hyperventilated that
sexual vice has now reached such proportions that it is destroying entire generations,
corrupting our youth, and causing them to neglect all forms of work! They are all rushing
to enjoy the various forms of vice that have become so freely available and so

enthusiastically promoted.

Khomeini nonetheless reassured his liberal revolutionary compatriots -- just months
before the revolution, while in Paris exile -- that women [would be] free in the Islamic
Republic in the selection of their activities and their future and their clothing. Much to its
retrospective dismay, a sizable chunk of Iran's liberal intelligentsia -- both male and
female -- lined up behind Khomeini, some even referring to him as an Iranian Gandhi.
Shortly after consolidating power, however, Khomeini and his disciples swiftly moved to
crush opposing views and curtail female social and sartorial freedoms. Islam doesn't
allow for people to [wear swimsuits] in the sea, he proclaimed shortly after becoming

supreme leader. We will skin their hide!

Women who resisted the mandatory veil were met with violence and intimidation,
including lyrical taunts of Ya roosari, ya toosari! (‘Cover your head or be smacked in
the head!). As Iranian Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi recently wrote,

Although the 1979 revolution in Iran is often called an Islamic revolution, it can actually

Chinese Influence Activities in
Select Countries

This report has focused on the range of challenges the United States faces in an era

of accelerating Chinese influence activities on multiple fronts. But this issue is hardly
unique to the United States—indeed, China’s influence activities now occur all around
the world. In some instances, notably Australia, these activities appear to have proceeded
much further than they have so far in the United States. In general, they seem more
advanced in Asia and Europe, but there is also evidence of such activities in Africa and
Latin America as well.

In order to explore some of the wider patterns that have emerged, this appendix offers
brief summaries of the effects of such activities in eight countries: Australia, Canada,
France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. In each
of these settings, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has refined its efforts through
trial and error in order to exploit a critical asymmetry: China’s Communist party-state
has established barriers to external political influence at home while, at the same time,
seizing upon the openness of democratic systems overseas.

China seeks to make itself more palatable to democratic societies by using many of
the customary vehicles of soft power—such as state-funded research centers, media
outlets, university ties, and people-to-people exchange programs. These programs
mimic the work of independent civil society institutions in a democracy, cloaking

the extent to which the party-state controls these activities and genuine civil society
is tightly repressed inside China. In conjunction with the dramatic expansion of
Chinese economic interests abroad, the Chinese government has focused its influence
initiatives on obscuring its policies and suppressing, to the extent possible, voices
beyond China’s borders that are critical of the CCP.' Targeting the media, academia,
and the policy community, Beijing seeks to penetrate institutions in democratic states
that might draw attention or raise obstacles to CCP interests, creating disincentives for
any such resistance. Chinese economic activity is another important tool in this effort.
Beijing is particularly skilled at using economic leverage to advance political goals in
the realm of ideas, working through indirect channels that are not always apparent
unless one examines Chinese business activities in conjunction with Beijing’s other
influence efforts.

2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *894

defendants are treated fairly - even in the absence of an overarching statutory command to that effect - while not doing the

same for crime victims, even where the CVRA directly commands that victims be treated with fairness. !°®

In any event, the Advisory Committee's proposal is decidedly unfair. The Committee proposes a two-pronged approach:

If the government intends to rely on a victim's testimony to establish the defendant's presence at the scene of the alleged
offense and the defendant establishes a need for the victim's address and telephone number, the court may:

[*895] () order the government to provide the information in writing to the defendant or the defendant's attorney; or

(ii) fashion a reasonable procedure that allows the preparation of the defense and also protects the victim's interests. 187

Notice that the court can order disclosure of the victim's address upon a mere showing by the defendant of a need, by
proceeding under subparagraph (1) of the proposed rule; the requirement to protect the victim's interests is triggered only if the
court chooses to proceed under paragraph (ii). And the proposed rule fails to give any guidance on when the court should
proceed under paragraph (ii) as opposed to paragraph (i).

The Advisory Committee's provision for two ways in which the court can avoid the requirements of withholding a victim's
name seems unnecessary. Subsection (d) of Rule 12.1 already allows a court to grant an exception to any of the requirements of
the rule for good cause. '88 This exception has been used to justify the government's nondisclosure of its witnesses in
situations where their safety might be jeopardized. !®° There is, accordingly, no need to add wiggle room language in Rule
12.1.

More important, the Advisory Committee's approach is fundamentally flawed. It makes no sense to require that the victim's
interests be considered only half the time - i.e., only where the court proceeds under paragraph (ii) but not under paragraph (1).
More important, since the Advisory Committee appears to agree that disclosing a victim's address raises obvious safety
concerns, allowing disclosure without any consideration of the victim's interests violates the CVRA's command that the victim
must be reasonably protected from the accused. !°° A court proceeding under paragraph (i) would be under no obligation to
protect[] the victim's interests (as paragraph (11) specifically provides), since it is a standard rule of construction that expressio
unius est exclusio alterius (the expression of one thing implies the exclusion of the other). !9! At a bare minimum, the CVRA
requires redrafting the rule so that the court always considers victims' interests before 1t can order production of a victim's
address.

Also interesting are the choices that the Advisory Committee specifically lists for a judge. The options given are (i) order the
government to provide the information in writing or (ii) fashion a reasonable procedure that allows the preparation of the
defense and also protects the victim's interests. The listing of these two (and only these two) options seems to mmply that the
court does not have [*896] a third option - Le., (iii) decline to order a victim's address be turned over. It is simply not the case
that every time the defendant can establish a need for information - no matter how trivial or how remotely connected to the
case - the court should either disclose a victim's address or fashion some other procedure toward the same end.

how to make decisions, understand how to approach a problem, or
otherwise live sensibly. Teachers are never shocked to be asked to pro-
vide personal or professional advice to a student having a problem—
any problem. If one takes one’s job seriously, teaching means being
available to help. But this important advisory job is confused by lesson
plans, and class hours, and lectures, none of which matter very much.

Why do I say that these things don’t matter very much? This is the
essence of what this book is about—the move from content-based in-
struction to cognitive-based learning, assisted by good teaching. This
means we will have to define this “new” kind of learning (it’s not re-
ally new, of course, just new to schools) and the “new” kind of teach-
ing that is a natural consequence of using this new learning method.

Most teachers understand and appreciate that delivering the re-
quired material is not their real job, at least it is not the reason they
signed on in the first place. The employers of teachers, on the other
hand—administrators, governments, department heads, and so on—
expect certain material to be covered. Exciting students is not on their
worry list. This is a big problem for teachers and for students, and one
that we will address here.

But my more serious concern is our conception of learning, not
teaching. Teaching follows one’s conception of learning so getting
learning right is of prime importance. When I said earlier that outsid-
ers to the learning profession wouldn’t get the real point, I was being
ironic. There is no learning profession. Why not?

In 1989, I moved from Yale to Northwestern to establish a new
institute, funded by Andersen Consulting, devoted to issues of chang-
ing training and education by the use of new technologies. I needed a
name for the institute and came up with The Institute for the Learning
Sciences. I made up the term learning sciences. There was no such field
in academia. Most people thought I meant we were planning to work
on how people learned science. The only academic fields that “stud-
ied” learning were psychology and education. Psychology, being an
experimental field, allows faculty to work only on experiments about
learning that provide data in a controlled environment. Education
faculty study how schools work and very rarely think about learning
outside of the school context or in a way different from the paradigm
already extant in schools. I wanted to create a learning profession. In
1989, there certainly didn’t seem to be one.

“How can you throw your gifts away? For what,” he asked me. “If you leave
that school, and give up on going to university, it will be like betraying
yourself.” At one point, he walked me out to the patch of hard-packed soil
where we parked the tractors and farm machinery. “What do you want to do
with your life,” he asked. “Do you want to be a farmer?”

I thought about it before answering. “I don’t know what will happen in the
future,” I said. “But if you ask me now, I would say I want to drive one of the
kibbutz trucks.”

I could see the shock and disappointment in his eyes. But it was the truth. I
did imagine that at some point I might want to make a life outside the kibbutz.
But I’d never lived anywhere else. If I was going to remain a part of it, I could
think of no better way than to join our little corps of drivers. Though they lived
on the kibbutz, they spent most of their time delivering or picking up goods in
places like Tel Aviv, Holon or Ashkelon. As the US Marines might have put it,
I guess I figured I’d join the truck-drivers and see the world.

The deeper reason I said no to my father, as I am sure he suspected, was that
I felt a need to take control of my own life. That was simply a part of growing
up, a process which probably happened more quickly for 1950s kibbutz children
than for town or city kids. We loved and respected our parents. But we were
living with other teenagers. We weren’t just residents of the kibbutz. We were
part of the economic collective, working in the fields or orchards, the garage
and the metal shop. This bred a sense of independence. I listened to my father’s
arguments. But this was a decision about my future. I felt I had to make it for
myself. I cared about my education. But I’d reached a stage where my life
outside the classroom, and my circle of friends, mattered more. I am sure that
the same impulse drove me in my continuing freelance forays into lockpicking
and petty larceny with Ido and Moshe.

So I returned to the kibbutz school. The level of teaching was nowhere near
the regional school’s. But we did begin studying new subjects like economics
and politics. There were two other welcome surprises as well. The first was the
arrival of a new history teacher. Knowledgable, enthusiastic and eloquent, he
had a rare gift for igniting excitement in his students. We studied the French
Revolution. He brought it to life with insights into Montesquieu, Rousseau and
John Locke, Louis XVI and Mary Antoinette, Robespierre and Napoleon. He
traced the dynamics that led to the revolution, and the way its ideals descended
into the bloodshed and terror that followed. He presented history as a human

My own negotiating team, not to mention the Americans, assumed I would now
turn my attention to the Palestinians. Arafat was pressing for us to go ahead with
phase-two of the Wye redeployments. In fact, he now wanted us to add the transfer
of three Arab villages on the edge of east Jerusalem: Eizaria, El-Ram and, most
importantly, Abu Dis, since from there you could see the golden dome of the
mosque above the Western Wall in the Old City. I understood why the villages
were politically important for him. But in practical terms, I also knew I’d have to
secure the support of the cabinet and the Knesset for what the Likud, and the main
religious parties too, would interpret as a first step toward “handing back
Jerusalem.”

For me, this underscored the problem at the heart of Oslo. We were transferring
land to Arafat, yet still without any serious engagement from the Palestinians on
the “permanent-status” questions, like the furture of Jerusalem, that were critical to
the prospects for real peace. They were critical, in fact, even to reaching a
framework agreement, or a declaration of principles, as a basis for a final treaty. I
probably should have seen the crisis-ridden spring of 2000 as a harbinger of the
difficulties when we finally got to that stage. I did make a first major effort to find
compromise ground on the main issues. I sent Gilead Sher and Shlomo Ben-Ami to
begin back-channel talks with a Palestinian team led by Abu Ala’a and Hassan
Asfour, the architects of Oslo. But as I prepared to seek Knesset approval for
returning the three additional villages to the Palestinians, my main Orthodox
coalition partners, Shas and the National Religious Party, as well as Sharansky’s
Yisrael ba’Aliyah, all threatened to walk out of the government. I did manage to
keep them on board, but only by getting the Knesset vote classified as a no-
confidence motion. That meant that if we lost, the government would fall and there
would be new elections. That was something none of them wanted. They feared
that Arik and the Likud would do better this time around, and they would end up
with fewer seats.

Still, even that didn’t avert a different kind of crisis. The vote was on May 15.
For the Palestinians, this was also A/-Naqgba Day, the annual marking of the 1948
“catastrophe” of the founding of the State of Israel. Danny Yatom told me the night
before there were intelligence reports of large protests planned for the West Bank
and in Gaza. President Clinton immediately got the American consul to deliver a
message to Arafat, saying that the President expected him to intervene against any
sign of violence. But Arafat’s reply was that, while he’d do what he could, he

already well known in the late 1930’s in what W.R. Hess and later John Flynn,
following electrical stimulation of cats in the lateral hypothalamus, called
“hypothalamic rage.” In the late 1940’s and 1950’s, work by National Institutes of
Mental Health’s Paul MacLean attributed it to the actions of parts of the emotional
“limbic” brain, particularly the fear-rage-attack coloring of experience by the
temporal lobe’s amygdaloid nucleus. Modern imaging studies in man have shown
that this source of emotional coloring is activated by new information, even before
the more rational parts of the neocortical brain processes it. How we feel about
something new arises before what we think about it. These survival-oriented states
of fight or flight are known to be biologically universal and demonstrable in even
single cell organisms.

A greater contribution to my brain metaphysics followed observations that
after several seconds of stimulation of other brain stem sites, the cats became alert
but quiet, staring into space for several minutes. Then, they circled slowly and
curled up on the ground. This was followed by several minutes of grooming and
loud purring. Difficult to handle cats became transiently tame, some coming close
for petting. | found that these same sites also increased the amplitude and reduced
the threshold for the cat’s knee jerk reflex. Responsiveness increased with
calmness. Particularly interesting was the finding that electrical induction of this

hissing rage. | referred to these experiments with my friends as my

KOK ok

I've been practicing BDSM for a while, now, and it has been amazing. I've had a lot of
very intense sexual experiences and I feel incredibly confident about my sexuality. I feel
very far away from my younger self, who realized that she was into BDSM and
completely freaked out. However, I used to keep a very detailed (albeit sporadic)
personal journal, and this allows me to look into the head of 20-year-old Clarisse. Here's
something I wrote only a couple of weeks after I met Richard, my first serious BDSM
partner:

On the surface I have a hard time understanding why this has shocked me so much -- the
fact that I wanted him to hurt me, the fact that even as I was facing down my demons and
crying and incoherent I wanted him to keep biting me, scratching me, bruising me, and
God, it was bad, but even now I wish it had been far worse... on some level I want to
have been physically scarred. He stopped finally because I started saying no, and
couldn't formulate a coherent answer through my tears when he asked me if I was
serious. But, of course, although I was serious, I also didn't want him to stop. Of course.
Of course I wanted him to hear me saying no and keep going, to be protesting and
overridden. And the reason I couldn't formulate a coherent answer wasn't even that I
didn't know the answer was, Yes, keep going. It was that I knew the answer was yes,
and when I faced it I started crying so hard I couldn't speak, and he... sensitively, I
guess... decided it was time to stop.

How cliche I am. (God, I'm sounding like some naive ingenue from a random de Sade
play or something, just discovering my sexuality or whatever.) How self-conscious. And
how humiliated and ashamed. Of all the things I think I expected from myself for this, if it
ever came true that this was what I wanted -- I never really actually expected to be
ashamed.

What I think is especially interesting about those paragraphs is that I felt a certain
recognition for my BDSM identity, I felt a certain inevitability about learning what I
needed. It made sense to me. Of course, I wrote, over and over. And at the same time I
acknowledged that I had considered BDSM before -- but that I hadn't really known what
that meant, and I'd had no idea how I would feel if I found it. I knew what I was thinking,
I knew what I had been thinking, and yet at the same time I didn't know. I had no idea. I
was completely confused.

I'm not so confused anymore. These days.... There are a lot of things I don't know, but
there are an awful lot of things I do know, too. I have gotten pretty good at knowing what
I want, even when it's hard to figure it out. And I have a very good sense of my
boundaries.

But I also keep trying to figure out how to expand them. This isn't just true with BDSM.
Arguably, my urge to go to Africa and put myself through extreme culture shock was
similar to the urge I feel to expand my head with BDSM. Some of the things I want to do
with my life and my body and my self seem almost opaque; totally irrational; a little
scary -- even to me. I love experiencing and analyzing emotions; experiencing and

Quantum Morse Machine

A Simple Free Will Theorem

In the quantum Morse machine, I do transmit information faster than the
speed of light. But the information I have transmitted is useless as it is, in
effect, encrypted using a one-time pad. The only person in possession of
a copy of this one-time pad is me: the sender.

Claude Shannon proved a one-time pad is unbreakable during the
Second World War. Yet the British succeeded in breaking it. How was
this possible?

The fatal weakness in the German one-time pads was the random
numbers used to code the messages were generated by a machine, and
were therefore not truly random. The numbers followed a sequence,
and it was possible for Allied code breakers to work out the sequence
and decode the messages. It follows that if we believe no message can
propagate faster than the speed of light, my sequence of numbers must
be non-computable. There must be no algorithm or computation that
could generate it. Otherwise it would be liable to the same sort of
decryption attack that the one-time pads suffered. If sequences of random
measurements taken in the universe are non-computable it follows the
Universe as a whole must be non-computable.

There are a few holes you could pick in this argument. Would it
be sufficient if it were impossible to decrypt the message in the age of
the Universe? What if there was an algorithm, but it was practically
unknowable? But, I am talking here of principle. In principle, the
Universe must be non-decryptable.

I'm writing about the Iran deal. So far have only sent a form paragraph in response to requests. Below. 
Noam 
On Iran, as usual, I'm a gloomy contrarian. I'm glad the treaty was signed, and it's kind of fun to watch the 
Republican lunatics shrieking hysterically as they try to kill it (as they may). And Israeli hypocrisy has gone 
well beyond being comical. But in fact the whole thing is farcical, in my opinon. In the US, Iran is the 
greatest threat to world peace, intoned constantly from on high, in the media, everywhere. There is also such a 
thing as world opinion, as measured by such ultra-radicals as Gallup. It turns out that the greatest threat to 
world peace is the US, by a very wide margin, no one else even close, and Iran barely mentioned. The 
American population is protected from these unwanted facts by the Free Press: not reported. There is an 
organization called US intelligence. They brief Congress regularly on the international security situation, all 
quite public. On Iran, they point out that it has very limited military power, even by regional standards (a small 
fraction of Saudi Arabia, for example). Its strategic doctrine is defensive. If— a big If— it has plans for nuclear 
weapons, that would be part of its deterrent strategy. Now who would be opposed to Iran having a deterrent 
strategy? Answer is clear: the rogue states that rampage violently in the region and don't want any impediment: 
the US and Israel, also lesser ones like UK and France. One simple way to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons 
would be to establish a nuclear-weapons free zone in the region, as has been done elsewhere (over US 
objections). That's been advocated by the Arab states for 20 years, with very wide global support, including 
Iran. It comes up regularly at the 5-year review meetings of the Nonproliferation Treaty, at the UN, again a few 
months ago, when, again, it was blocked by the US to protect its Israeli client, which has a huge nuclear 
weapons arsenal and wants to keep it. Again, the population is protected from such facts by the Free Press 
(though in this case there are some fringe exceptions, and of course the Arms Control literature). Same with the 
rest of the litany. Reading the US and UK press is like living in some lunatic asylum. I'm wondering whether 
to write about it — again; have done so repeatedly. It's like talking to a wall. Iran has an awful government, 
though by the standards of such US allies as Saudi Arabia, it's practically heaven. 
Nevertheless, better to have the treaty than not to, given the nature of the asylum.

What you suggest is very much the model that has been current in the behavioral sciences for many years. It has a

Data illusions. 
A child doesn't grow arms and legs rather than wings, or a mammalian vs insect visual system, the way an ant searches 
for food. Rather, the path of development is sharply restricted (and evolution follows constraints too). Acquisition of 
language (and other cognitive achievements) seems very much like physical growth. 
Highly contentious in the field, but in my opinion that's a comment on the failures of the field.

news flow to support relative performance for Hess in 1Q17. Greatest risk to the

1Q investment thesis

MGM is a levered play to improving/accelerating US economic growth. The US makes up
80% of EBITDA (70% Vegas, 20% Macau, 10% US regional) and the company has 4-5x
net debt/EBITDA which is high, but coming down to under 4x by end of 2017 which
could allow for a possible upgrade to investment grade by the end of 2017 or early
2018.

MGM has high operating leverage (50%+ flow through of revenues) and should benefit
from any macroeconomic improvement as well as already healthy/strong Las Vegas
fundamentals (visitation +3% YTD, RevPAR +6% which is one of best hotel markets in
the US). MGM benefits from both consumer (80%) and business (20%) travel. There is
zero supply growth in Las Vegas the next 2-3 years and virtually no Airbnb/disruption
risk as staying at integrated casino resorts on the Strip is key to the experience.

MGM should see accelerating growth in 2017 to a very high +24% Y/Y on an organic
basis. We think this is some of the highest growth we will see in the Gaming, Lodging &
Leisure industries. MGM should also see a meaningful free cash flow inflection in 2017
as capex falls off dramatically after its 2 new property openings in Washington DC and
Cotai/Macau.

3. Ms Maxwell kept sex toys and costumes in the Palm Beach mansion and dressed IEE prior to sex
sessions with Mr Epstein. S Maxwell herself wore black vinyl during sex sessions with Mr Epstein.

4. 2s paid between US $200 and $ 5000 US sex, depending on whether it involved travel and other
men.

5, BE «was required to have sex with friends of Ms Maxwell and Mr Epstein, including Glenn Dubin, Les

8. Ms Maxwell knew age and laughed about it when she introduced her to Andrew.
9. Ms Maxwell and Mr Epstein tried to persuade [J to bear his child.

10. After sexual encounters with male friends of Mr Epstein and/or Ms Maxwell, Ms Maxwell and Mr Epstein

Korea presumably plans to defend itself, should war erupt on the
peninsula, by threatening U.S. regional allies and targets in the United
States.

North Korea's mission requires small, lightweight warheads, and missiles
that work -- and the only way to know that they work is to test them. So
far, the weapons have proved unspectacular. The country's first nuclear
test, conducted in 2006, was an embarrassment. Pyongyang had told the
Chinese that the device would generate four kilotons of explosive power,
but it ended up producing less than one. The second test in 2009 fared
slightly better, producing between one and eight kilotons, although it is
not known what size of a blast the North Koreans had sought. Moreover,
Pyongyang has much more work to do before it can boast weapons that
will actually fit on its missiles (which have been, themselves, a series of
humiliating failures).

Observers in the West who presume that North Korea's behavior must be
about signaling should remember NATO and the United States' own
experience during the Cold War. The United States understood then that
the ability to conduct nuclear operations was the very foundation of a
credible deterrence strategy. Today, a sound strategy for dealing with
North Korea should not ascribe ulterior motives to acts that the United
States once considered rational and routine.

The view that nuclear weapons are merely political instruments -- suitable
for sending signals, but not waging wars -- is now so common in
Washington, London, and Berlin that it is hard to find anyone who
disagrees. Yet those comforting assumptions are not shared by leaders
everywhere. Beyond North Korea, Russia is cutting down its arsenal,
modernizing the nuclear forces it plans to keep, and increasing its reliance
on nuclear weapons in national defense strategy. China is slowly
expanding its own arsenal, while substantially improving its weapons.
And Iran seems so committed to going nuclear that it has been ready to
endure crippling sanctions and risk foreign attack.

1Q investment thesis

Based on past precedence, our view is that the AET/HUM deal is more likely than not to
be approved by the courts (ruling likely to come in January 2017). PF 2018 earnings
should be close to $11.50 (vs $9.70 consensus), even before taking into account the
upside from tax reform (+15% to EPS} and rising interest rates (+5%). In the event that
the deal breaks, we see little downside and potential upside in 1Q17 in the form of
capital deployment (AET remains underlevered and in the absence of a deal could look to
aggressively repurchase stock}. Current estimates do not include share repurchase and
based on its history of repurchasing shares using free cash flow and its balance sheet
capacity, we expect AET to repurchase a significant amount (~10%) of its shares in
2017 post deal break, providing initial downside support and ultimately driving upside to
Street estimates.

Deregulation/Gov't Legislation: Repeal and Replace of the ACA creates some
uncertainty, but neither AET nor HUM derive a significant amount of EPS from the ACA.
Meanwhile, Republicans have historically supported Medicare Advantage (80% of HUM’s
revenue}, and we expect a stronger rate environment under this Administration than
over the past 8 years.

Tax Policy: As a domestic only company with a relatively high tax rate (est. 35% in
2017), AET would benefit from tax reform. We believe that some benefit would be lost
to minimum MLR rebates or competition, but if taxes are lowered 15%, then we assume
that they keep about 2/3 of the benefit (19% to EPS).

Catalysts: Deal resolution, capital allocation update, tax reform, rising interest rates.

Latest report: MCO rally has just begun; beneficiaries of the non-Health
Care upside from Trump

1Q risks: Risks to the downside are courts not approving the HUM acquisition, lower-
than-expected membership growth and higher than expected cost trend. CMS will issue
the rate update for 2018 for Medicare Advantage in late February, a reg which we
expect to be benign, but which could be worse than expected.

Company Description: Aetna is one of the nation's largest managed care organizations,
covering roughly 23 million members. The company focuses on three main business
segments: Health Care (health insurance, dental, behavioral health and pharmacy benefit

stake. I didn’t know whether peace was within reach. I was still deeply skeptical.
But if it was, we had to accept that Jerusalem would be key. And if the summit
failed, for whatever reason, what inevitably awaited us was “confrontation.”

Israel Hasson, the Shin Bet veteran, spoke first. He saw two choices. Either we
could retain Isrsaeli sovereignty over a “united Jerusalem” with functional, day-to-
day autonomy for the Palestinians in their neighborhoods, or we could in effect
divide the city. “Divide sovereignty.” He didn’t say which he favored, only that it
was essential that we made the decision now if we could, however difficult or
reluctant Arafat was as a negotiating partner. If we waited, we’d end up having to
deal with Islamists: Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Oded Eran, the career diplomat
whom I'd put in charge of frustrating, formal talks with the Palestinians in the
months preceding the summit , said he was convinced that we should give the
Palestinians full sovereignty over at least the “outer” Arab neighborhoods in East
Jerusalem, which had become part of the city only when we’d expanded the city
boundaries after 1967. He said that was in Israel’s own interest. We had no historic
connection to these Arab villages, and something like 130,000 Palestinian lived
there. “Why should we want to annex them,” he asked. It would be like accepting
the “right of return” through the back door.

Dan Meridor’s voice, for me, was especially important. I knew he was as
determined as I was to try to get a peace agreement with the Palestinians. But he
was also a former Likudnik, and a native Jerusalemite. “I’m against any
concessions when it comes to Israeli sovereignty,” he said. “Any attempt to divide
Jerusalem would be a serious blow, and not just for Jews in Israel.” For centuries,
Jewish communities all over the world, had looked to Jerusalem, prayed for
Jerusalem. The yearly Seder meal, on Passover, ends with the Hebrew phrase:
Shanah haba b’Yerushalaim. Next year, in Jerusalem. “What we decided here in
Camp David,” Dan said, “also affects Jews in New York. In Moscow. In
Johannesburg.” He urged us to focus instead on offering Arafat as attractive as
possible a package of concessions on all the other issues. “Then let him decide.
But even if sovereignty over Jerusalem means that the deal collapses, I’m not
willing the pay that price.”

No voices were raised. It was the rarest of political discussions. People offered
their views, and listened to others’. Amnon Lipkin pointed out that a large area of
what was now came inside the boundaries of Jerusalem was not part of the city
he’d known before 1967. Echoing Oded Eran, he said: “It’s in our interest for as

and doing all this across time frames that
stretch from the distant past to multiple
possible futures (9). Consistent with
this hypothesis, measures of sociality in
troops of baboons have been found to be
highly correlated with infant survival,
and cross-species comparisons have
shown that the evolution of large and
metabolically expensive brains is more
closely associated with social than
ecological complexity (9).

Our survival depends on our
connection with others. Born to the
most prolonged period of utter
dependency of any animal, human
infants must instantly engage their
parents in protective behavior, and the
parents must care enough about their
offspring to nurture and protect them. If
infants do not elicit nurturance and
protection from caregivers, or if
caregivers are not motivated to provide
such care over an extended period of
time, then the infants will perish along
with the genetic legacy of the parents
(J0). Our developmental dependency
mirrors our evolutionary heritage.
Hunter/gatherers did not have the benefit
of natural weaponry, armor, strength,
flight, stealth, or speed relative to many
other species. Human survival depended
on collective abilities, not on individual
might.

Selfish Genes, Social Brains

It is the gene that is obligatorily
selfish, not the human brain. Genes that
promote behaviors that increase the odds
of the genes surviving are perpetuated.
One implication of this simple insight is
that evolution can be viewed as the
competition between genes using
individuals and social structures as their
temporary vehicles. The genetic
constitution of Homo Sapiens in the long

Page |22

run derives not solely from the
reproductive success of individuals, but
also from the success of their children to
reproduce. Hunter/gatherers who did not
form social connections and who did not
feel a compulsion to return to share their
food or defense with their offspring may
have been more likely to survive to
procreate again, but given the long
period of dependency of human infants
their offspring may have been less likely
to survive to procreate. The result is
selection that strongly favors the ability
to process information that could
contribute to the formation and
maintenance of social capacities and
connections — that is, a social brain.
These social capacities evolved hand in
hand with genetic, neural, and hormonal
mechanisms to support them because the
resulting social behaviors helped humans
survive, reproduce, and care for
offspring sufficiently long that they too
survived to reproduce (//-1/3). Relative
to other animals, the striking
development of and increased
connectivity within the human cerebral
cortex, especially the frontal and
temporal regions, are among the key
evolutionary developments in this
regard. The cerebral cortex is a mantle
of between 2.6 to 16 billion neurons with
each neuron receiving 10,000 to 100,000
synapses in their dendritic trees (e.g.,
14). The expansion of the frontal
regions in the human brain contributes to
the human capacities for reasoning,
planning, performing mental
simulations, theory of mind, and
thinking about self and others. The
temporal regions of the brain, in turn, are
involved with aspects of social
perception, memory, and
communication. The means for guiding
behavior through the environment
emerged prior to neocortical expansion.

Theorem

Theorem. The paper received huge press attention and has been widely

discussed in the scientific community. Their theorem states that;
provided experimenters are free to run their experiment as they choose,
the behavior of the particles they experiment upon is not determined in
advance. Particles have free will!

If we go back to the Bell Test experiment, this proved twin particles
do not carry around a parcel of information telling them what to do.
Perhaps they get their marching orders from some outside influence.
There are two possibilities. A particle is either told what to do by its
environment or it gets its information from some data source. Can we
use the laws of physics to test these possibilities? We don't need to know
how the influence works, just that it might exist in principle.

Conway and Kochen prove there can be no external influence, and
when a particle reveals its spin, that spin was not known beforehand. It
is independent of any information in the history of the Universe up to
that point.

Conway and Kochen’s proof is elegant and involves some mental
gymnastics, but it is no harder than Archimedes’ proof of the infinity of
primes we looked at earlier. Let us start with our twin particles. We are
going to pick bosons, which have whole number spin. If you measure the
spin, you will always get a reading of -1, 0 or +1. ‘Spir’ is one of those
words physicists use to explain quantum things. It does not necessarily
denote rotation but, if your mental model is a spinning top, that’s not too

TRUST AND SUPPORT:

* Supporting her goals in life.

* Respecting her right to her own feelings, friends, activities, and opinions.

All these things ought to be present ina BDSM relationship! Some people do heavy role-
play situations where they have specific personas that they don't want to break out of...
and they still can make sure that all those elements are included. For example, they can
keep simultaneous journals about the relationship, and thereby keep up with each others’
feelings and consent without breaking out of their roles.

I also think that the list is especially useful in that it highlights places where non-
consensual control is likely to happen... and therefore, places where BDSMers
should be especially careful. For example, failing to support a partner's life goals would
be okay in the middle of an intense BDSM encounter. But afterwards, it might be good to
give extra support, just because that can be such an important genuine danger spot.

Just like vanilla people, BDSMers have a lot of unspoken elements of our relationships.
For example -- the partner I mentioned earlier, who held me in place when I gave him a
hug on the street. We didn't negotiate that particular act ahead of time. But we have an
established relationship, and we've done similar things before; I knew that if I wanted to
talk about it -- or ask him not to do it -- then he'd listen. And, even more importantly, the
rest of our relationship lines up with the Equality Wheel.

he Palm Beach County Main Detention Center is on the
west side of Lake Worth Lagoon, which separates West
3 Palm Beach from the island of Palm Beach. Epstein’s

home on El Brillo Way is five miles to the east. Mary’s high

 school is several miles to the west.
It's fitting, somehow, that this jail—which is the jail Epstein
'ends up in, after turning himself in to the local sheriff—lies in
7 between the two points.
The detention center’s inmates, their families, and their law-
ers call it the Gun Club, a reference not only to the jail’s address,
on Gun Club Road, but also to its population of hustlers, bur-
glars, drug dealers, rapists, and murderers. There’s the occa-
sional hooker as well. And, from time to time, Haitian refugees
fe lodged there.
There are three thousand inmates in all.

e Federal prosecutors made the unprecedented demand that Mr. Epstein pay a
minimum of $150,000 per person to an unnamed list of women.they referred to as
minors and whom they insisted required representation by a guardian ad litem. Mr.
Epstein’s counsel later established that all but one of these individuals were actually
adults, not minors. Even then, though demanding payment to the women, the
USAO eventually asserted that it could not vouch for the veracity of any of the
claims that these women might make.

e Federal prosecutors made the highly unusual demand that Mr. Epstein pay the fees
of a civil attorney chosen by the prosecutors to represent these alleged “victims”
should they choose to bring any civil litigation against him. They also proposed
sending a notice to the alleged “victims,” stating, in an underlined sentence, that
should they choose their own attorney, Mr. Epstein would not be required to pay
their fees. The prosecutors further demanded that Mr. Epstein waive his right to
challenge any of the allegations made by these “victims.”

e The Assistant U.S. Attorney involved in this matter recommended for the civil
attorney, a highly lucrative position, an individual that we later discovered was
closely and personally connected to the Assistant U.S. Attorney’s own boyfriend.

e Federal prosecutors represented to Mr. Epstein’s counsel that they had identified
‘(and later rechecked and re-identified) several alleged “victims” of federal crimes

provide financial benefits to victims. Only through state discovery provisions did
we later learn that many of the women on the rechecked “victim list” could not
possibly qualify under § 2255. The reason is that they, themselves, testified that
they did not suffer any type of harm whatsoever, a prerequisite for the civil recovery
under § 2255. Moreover, these women stated that they did not, now or in the past,
consider themselves to be victims.

I have told the brads and barry,- I am done. its not a negotiation, out!! - fyi given my carlyn joslin 
castrucci, admonishments,- though my involvement in those - in one instance only gave a name - in 
another only given an dictated choice btween two 250k preparers. and for castrucci, I actually sent 
emails that i take no responsiblity for his being hired. - however you felt strongly that I should be saddled 
with their outcomes .even with brad wechsler, i again said two months in, Leon, he doesnt get it. I tell you 
this so that you will understand that I will not interview, recommend or vet any new hire. 
A story - In 1993 trump and I had a friend that kept telling his pilots how to fly, and when to fly, he couldnt 
help himself from hiring morons as co pilots, and maintenance people based on cheapest rates. Donald and I 
tried and tried to talk some sense into him, to no avail. Donald and I were in aspen, sitting at little 
nells. when the friends plane crashed into the side of aspen mountain , klliing him and all on board,- Trump 
looked at me and said without a blink , I guess NOW he wishes he would have listened to us.- a metaphor for 
your office. . . had we not waited to the very last hour having had a six month window and tens of 
unasnwered text and emails re decisions needed including the 1031. you would have saved way more than 
you often feel obliged to argue about. . silly but i reallize you are stressed. 
Barry will need to sit with brad for months, to absorb all the co's , structures. cash flow, financial statments

you and brad two years.ago . accurate numbers first. and foremost. . ( last week gaming report stil 
funky). IT etc I pointed out some of the more glaring errors to barry to give him a flavor of what is to come. 
Tuesday if you like we should discuss Giacometti , and pesner . difficult to finesse him if they are 
filing documents that you won't. these ridiculous conversations with tons of people on the phone , removes 
any claim you might have to not be considered a WILLFUL NON-FILER. ( after youve been told by attnys

continued settlement construction in the
West Bank and East Jerusalem.

Israel’s military occupied those
territories, along with Gaza, in the 1967
Arab-Israeli war. Palestinians view them
as the key territorial elements of their
future state.

In a June 2009 address in Cairo, a speech
that asked for a “new beginning” with the
Islamic world, Obama said: “The United
States does not accept the legitimacy of
continued Israeli settlements.” He also
did not stop in Israel on that trip, instead
visiting Saudi Arabia, Egypt and
Germany, where he emphasized the
horror of the Holocaust and the moral
imperative of defending Israel. Romney,
among others, made the omission a
campaign issue.

But on regional security issues, Obama
and Netanyahu have deepened
cooperation amid rising U.S. military aid
to Israel. Obama has agreed with
Netanyahu that Iran must not be allowed
to use its uranium-enrichment program to
develop a nuclear weapon, an issue that
the two will discuss during Obama’s

Clinton felt we would need a draft document with broad areas of agreement before
a diplomatic ““endgame”’ could begin. I disagreed on that. I argued that 1f we tried
to produce such a document, there would never be a summit. In fact, we’d never
get a draft document worth anything. “Neither side is going to commit itself on
issues like borders, refugees, or Jerusalem,” I said, pointing out that even in our
back-channel talks, the only forum in which there had been a hint of progress,
those issues had barely been touched.

He did accept that “pre-negotiation” would never crack the main issues. But he
still said that before he could contemplate a summit, he would need Madeleine
Albright and Dennis Ross to talk in detail with us and the Palestinians. “There had
to be a firm basis to work on,” he said. Even then,m he said, he was almost sure
Arafat would resist the idea of a summit. And on that last point, he proved right. I
spoke to the President by phone after Arafat’s trip to Washington. “He thinks
you’re trying to trap him into a summit, and that when it fails, Il blame him,” he
told me.

The very next day, the stakes increased dramatically. For months, military
intelligence had been warning of the potential for violence if we couldn’t find a
long-term political resolution of the Palestinian conflict. But the report which
landed on my desk on June 16, 2000 was more specific. It said Arafat had called in
his security people and said: “My strategic understanding is that Israel is not
interested in reaching a deal. Therefore, we are preparing ourselves for a violent
and prolonged confrontation.” A few days later, we got an even more worrying
report, saying the security officers had been told to begin “intensive training.”
Arafat was quoted as saying: “The Palestinian Authority is confronted by a strong
and dangerous Israel, headed by a Prime Minister who is not interested in real
peace. The proof of that is that when he was Chief of Staff, he was the only senior
officer to oppose the Oslo Agreement.” I summoned my security team: Mofaz as
chief of staff; the heads of military intelligence, Mossad and the Shin Bet. I told
them that Arafat was wrong. My inalterable “red line” would always be Israel’s
national and security interests. But as long as those were protected, I wasn’t just
interested in reaching an agreement with the Palestinians. I was determined to do
everything possible to try to get one. But I also said that we had to make sure we
were fully prepared for responding to “Palestinian violence and, at some stage,
full-blown terror.”

The great rotation

There is an awful lot being written about the next bursting
bubble, which, according to pundits, is fixed income. The

fear is either that inflation very quickly begins to
reaccelerate because of monetary policy and central banks
will need to aggressively slam on the policy brakes, or that
investors are going to begin a Great Rotation out of fixed
income.

The Great Rotation scare being talked about argues that
individual investors will apparently all wake up one day and
collectively sell their bonds to buy stocks. For individual
investors, it’s very unlikely that we will see selling of core
bonds until investors actually lose money—and we don’t
expect that to happen soon. In our portfolios next year, we
envision owning more world equity markets, and owning
less cash and short-duration fixed income. So | agree with
the risk rotation, but a mad dash by individual investors out
of fixed income seems unnecessary and unlikely.

The balancing act for central banks is to try to stimulate
growth without provoking inflation. There is enough excess
capacity in labor markets that the greater policy concern
remains disinflationary pressure. While we are keeping a
close eye on inflation expectations, which have been
rising, our economics team continues to believe inflation
comes after growth and therefore isn’t a threat to this
cycle of easy monetary policy. We expect the Fed,
European Central Bank and Bank of Japan will continue to
promote “easy money.”

There is going to be an inflation shock that will come with
accelerating growth—we just don’t see it next year. But in
preparation for that scenario, our team has already begun to
do work on the theme of inflation protection.

Now what?

We invest with a 12-month outlook, but also take advantage
of short-term trading opportunities. But to borrow a phrase
from my daughter, patience is the key to joy. Into year-end,
markets face higher uncertainty and weaker activity. We are
going to see more headlines, unfortunately with less real
news. In the short term, both issues will extract a higher risk
premia from risk assets, which should create some
interesting opportunities.

For where we believe the macro cycle is right now, we
want to be increasing our allocation to equities as we look
into 2013. We continue to barbell those equity allocations
between the United States, which continues to lead the global
recovery, and emerging markets, where we see significant
growth potential. While we have added to our exposure in
Europe and continue to see scope for investment opportunity
ahead, we don’t feel it’s a market that is gapping away from us.

We are also doing tactical work in our hedge fund allocations.
We are looking to be more directional in our risk taking
next year, particularly looking at long/short and event-
driven strategies. In fixed income, we continue to like
credit, but need to be more selective. We are looking at
total and absolute return fixed income strategies that can be
more nimble in how they invest duration. We expect to hold
less short-duration and cash next year across portfolios.

AS a last mention, for anyone looking for a timely read, | just
finished William Silber’s book about Paul Volcker. It is great
context for how we got to where we are today and a
reminder that while the past doesn’t ever exactly repeat
itself, it does rhyme. It’s also a subtle reminder of why
strong leadership and bipartisan counsel are essential for
effectively navigating the road ahead.

| very much look forward to our ongoing investment
dialogue with you.

leged conduct is sufficiently extreme and
outrageous enough to permit recovery.
Stuto, at 827. The attacks on September
11, 2001 were undoubtedly extreme and
outrageous. The Court finds that if the
Ashton and Burnett Plaintiffs’s allegations
sufficiently allege that Defendants sup-
ported, aided and abetted, or conspired
with the September 11 terrorists, they will
have also stated a claim for intentional
infliction of emotional distress. See Bur-
nett I, 274 F.Supp.2d at 107-08 (analyzing
claims under New York law).

7. Trespass

[85] The Federal Plaintiffs bring a
claim for trespass on the theory that De-
fendants assisted and encouraged those
who intentionally entered the World Trade
Center property. New York courts de-
scribe this cause of action as “the interfer-
ence with a person’s right to possession of
real property either by an unlawful act or
a lawful act performed in an unlawful man-
ner.” N.Y. State Nat'l Org. for Women v.
Terry, 886 F.2d 1839, 1361 (2d Cir.1989)
(citing Ivancic v. Olmstead, 66 N.Y.2d 349,
352, 497 N.Y.S.2d 326, 488 N.E.2d 72
(1985)). To the extent that the Federal
Plaintiffs sufficiently plead that Defen-
dants acted in concert with the September
11 hijackers, they may proceed with this
claim. Wantanabe Realty Corp. v. City of
New York, 01 Civ. 10187(LAK), 2003 WL
22862646, at *4 (S.D.N-Y. Dec. 3., 2003)
(citing Pittman, 149 F.3d at 122-28).

8. Negligence

[86-88] In New York, a plaintiff may
establish negligent infliction of emotional
distress under the bystander or direct
duty theory. Baker v. Dorfman, 239 F.3d
415, 421 (2d Cir.2000). Under the by-
stander theory, “a defendant’s conduct is
negligent as creating an unreasonable risk
of bodily harm to a plaintiff and such

349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES

conduct is a substantial factor in bringing
about injuries to the plaintiff in conse-
quence of shock or fright resulting from
his or her contemporaneous observation of
serious physical injury or death inflicted
by the defendant’s conduct on a member of
the plaintiff's immediate family in his or
her presence.” Bovsun v. Sanper, 61
N.Y.2d 219, 223-24, 473 N.Y.S.2d 357, 461
N.E.2d 848 (1984). Under the direct duty
theory, a plaintiff suffers emotional dis-
tress caused by “defendant’s breach of a
duty which unreasonably endangered
[plaintiffs] own physical safety.” Mortise
v. United States, 102 F.8d 693, 696 (2d
Cir.1996).

[89-92] To establish a claim for negli-
gence under New York law, “a plaintiff
must show that the defendant owed the
plaintiff a cognizable duty of care, that the
defendant breached that duty, and that the
plaintiff suffered damages as a proximate
cause of that breach.” King v. Crossland
Savings Bank, 111 F.3d 251, 259 @d Cir.
1997). The most basic element of a negli-
gence claim is the existence of a duty owed
to plaintiffs by defendants. Palsgraf v.
Long Island R.R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339, 342,
162 N.E. 99 (1928); see also Burnett I, 274
F.Supp.2d at 108 (dismissing negligence
claims against Defendant Al Haramain Is-
lamic Foundation because complaint failed
to allege or identify any duty owed to
Plaintiffs). Banks do not owe non-custom-
ers a duty to protect them from the inten-
tional torts of their customers. Renner v.
Chase Manhattan Bank, No. 98 Civ.
926(CSH), 1999 WL 47239, at *13
(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 3, 1999) (citing cases);
Burnett [, 274 F.Supp.2d at 109 (“Plaintiffs
offer no support, and we have found none,
for the proposition that a bank is liable for
injuries done with money that passes
through its hands in the form of deposits,
withdrawals, check clearing services, or
any other routine banking service.”). The

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017895
"
IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031584.txt,"negotiations have been underway, with significant progress attained on the
majority of the chapters of the Cyprus problem as a result of the intensive
efforts put forward by the two sides in reaching convergences.
Furthermore, with the recent agreement on the Joint Declaration of
February 11, 2014, an important milestone in the negotiations has been
reached, which clearly provides for the broad outline of a solution and the
main principles upon which the new partnership will be established.
Hence, the announcement of the Joint Declaration triggered a very
positive atmosphere that was further fostered by the support of a wide
spectrum of actors on both sides as well as the extensive espousal received
by the international community.

The Far-Reaching Consequences of the Problem

In light of this promising political climate on the island, combined with
the existence of some external factors that are currently at play, there is an
historic opportunity that should not be missed in bringing the long-
overdue Cyprus problem to a closure. The recent developments in our
region strongly signal a pressing need in this direction. It is beyond doubt
that the Cyprus problem holds back the potential of cooperation in a
broader context. Since its conception, the relations between Turkey and
Greece have been negatively affected by it. A full-scale rapprochement
between the two countries has been held hostage to the chronic status quo
on the island. In the course of time, this has been exploited as an excuse to
oppose Turkey’s bid for EU membership through the blocking of some
chapters in her accession talks. EU-NATO strategic cooperation has also
been hampered in a similar fashion due to the non-existence of diplomatic
relations between South Cyprus and Turkey. As a NATO member, Turkey
has proven to be an indispensable strategic partner of the Transatlantic
cooperation since the inception of the Cold War. Although a NATO
Council decision in late 2002 enabled the participation of the non-EU
members of NATO in the European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP),
the Greek Cypriot side has been blocking Turkey’s involvement both in
the ESDP and her prospective membership in the European Defense
Agency (EDA). As a result, no meaningful dialogue can practically be
established between the EU and NATO, creating a situation whereby the

10 The debate in Australia has evolved considerably since 2009, when Prime Minister Kevin Rudd proposed
campaign finance reform legislation that would have rendered foreign-sourced political donations illegal,
and Turnbull (as opposition leader in parliament) declined to support the legislation. Rudd has argued that
this legislation would have mitigated some of the more problematic behaviors regarding foreign influence
that have since occurred. Others, however, maintain that the ban would not have stopped the bulk of
CCP-backed donations, which are channeled through Australian residents and citizens, and that the more
important reform was to ensure greater transparency in identifying foreign agents. For Rudd’s critique, see

CANADA

Canada has a long history of engagement with the PRC dating back to 1970.
Substantial and rapidly expanding connections with China at multiple levels include
human flows (migrants, tourists, students), trade (with a major and recurring
imbalance in China’s favor), and diplomatic interactions. There are roughly

160,000 PRC students in Canadian schools, about 70 percent of them in universities
and colleges. Per capita, this is about three times as large as in the United States and

"
IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027884.txt,"I was intrigued by the mechanical puzzle and managed to locate two slightly
rusted locks. One was a Yale, the other an Israeli-made lookalike called a
Nabob. One evening after dinner, I searched the ground around the kibbutz
garage for shards of metal that looked like they might fit into the key slot, and
spent the next half-hour or so propped against a tree, trying and failing to coax
either lock to open. I realized I would need to discover how the locks worked.
But how to get inside to see?

Saturday afternoons in Mishmar Hasharon were a quiet time, like the old
Jewish neighborhoods and shtetls back in Europe but minus the religious
trappings. The next day, I waited until mid-afternoon and walked past the
bakery towards the garage. Its roll-down, corrugated door was locked. So was
the structure next to it, where the blacksmith and metalwork shop were. But
attached to the blacksmith’s was a hut where our scrap metal was dumped. I
doubted it would be locked, and it wasn’t. Pausing to let my eyes get used to the
dark, I made my way into the metalwork area. I crossed to the cabinet where the
tools were kept. I took out a steel jigsaw used for cutting through metal and,
hiding it under my shirt, made my way out again.

Fortunately, the saw was up to the task of cutting into the softer alloy that
made up the body of the locks. Once I’d cut inside them, I saw they shared the
same basic construction. There was a series of springs and shafts which, in
response to the indentations of a key, aligned in such a way to allow the lock to
open. I sneaked back into the metalwork shop five or six times. By trial and
error, I managed to shape one of jigsaw blades into a pick tool that seemed like
it should do the job. For days, I manipulated it into each of the padlocks. I knew
I had the principle right, but I still couldn’t get it to work. Blisters formed on my
thumb and fingers. Then, finally, the Yale sprung open! With each successive
try I got better at knowing how to put the blade in, when and where to rotate it
and how much pressure to apply. After fashioning a half-dozen other tools, each
slightly different in width and shape, I reached a point where I could get the
mechanism to work on my first try. Other locks — doors, trunks, closets — were
even easier after I made picks for them as well.

I couldn’t resist sharing my newly acquired skill with a couple of the boys in
my class, and word gradually spread. There was a handful of slightly older boys
who we referred to as the “rogues”. They weren’t delinquents. They were free
spirits, bridling at the uniform expectations and rules of kibbutz life. Over the
next few years, as co-conspirators more than close friends, I found myself
drawn to two of them. Ido and Moshe were 18 months older than me. Though

There are subjects that are school subjects and there are subjects
that are life subjects and teenagers can tell the difference. They
work harder at the life subjects.

And, what is the difference between these two kinds of subjects? Goals.
It is as simple as that.

Instead of simply saying what is wrong with schools and what
teenagers are really like in school, I want to take a different tack.

Some teenagers wake up in the morning wanting to learn history
or algebra but they are a very small minority of the school population.
There is no minority, however, when it comes to dating or driving for
teenagers. They all want to do these things. So the question I want to
ask is:

Are there other things that all teenagers want to do and are those
things connected in some way with learning?

Or, to put this another way, if school had been designed around
something other than subjects, what would it have been designed
around? Driving and dating, which we know are winners in a teenager’s
world, could be seen as subjects, or they could be seen as instances
of something else, and that something else might be something
important to learn.

Students everywhere might want to learn whatever that is and they
would work hard to learn it. If we can turn the question around in that
way, maybe we can design better learning situations for everybody.

So, the question is:

What are driving and dating instances of, with respect to learning?
Or, to address this from the cognitive science point of view:

What is it that students are doing when they learn to drive

and date that they might be getting better at while doing those

things?

Can we view whatever it is they are getting better at as an example

of the kinds of things we should want to teach and that students
should want to learn? Answering these questions will allow us to

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021081.txt,"PEP / Pease (Tax Policy) - PEP is Personal
Exemption Phase-out designed to eliminate
personal income exemptions for high
earners; 3) Pease is a similar phase-out, but
instead of applying to personal exemption, it
applies to most of the itemized deductions of
a taxpayer’s claims (mortgage interest,
charitable gifts, state & local taxes paid,
etc.); Pease is named after Representative
Donald Pease (D-OH) who pushed for its
enactment in 1990.

Present Value - A single number that
expresses a flow of current and future
income (or payments) in terms of an
equivalent lump sum received (or paid)
today. The present value depends on the
rate of interest used (the discount rate). For
example, if $100 is invested on January 1 at
an annual interest rate of 5 percent, it will
grow to $105 by January 1 of the next year.
Hence, at an annual 5 percent interest rate,
the present value of $105 payable a year
from today is $100.

Patient Protection and Affordable Care
Act (PPACA) — A federal statute as the
result of the healthcare reform. Signed into
law on 3/23/10, the PPACA aims to expand
Medicaid eligibility, incentivize businesses to
provide health care benefits, prohibit denial
of coverage/claims based on pre-existing
conditions, establish health insurance
exchanges, and support for medical
research. The costs of these provisions are
offset by a variety of taxes, fees, and cost-
saving measures, such as new Medicare
taxes for high-income brackets, taxes on
indoor tanning, improved fairness in the
Medicare Advantage program relative to
traditional Medicare, and fees on medical
devices and pharmaceutical companies.

Productivity - Average real output per unit
of input. Labor productivity is average real
output per hour of labor. The growth of labor
productivity is defined as the growth of real
output that is not explained by the growth of
labor input alone. Total factor productivity is
average real output per unit of combined
labor and capital services. The growth of
total factor productivity is defined as the
growth of real output that is not explained by
the growth of labor and capital. Labor
productivity and total factor productivity differ
in that increases in capital per worker raise
labor productivity but not total factor
productivity.

Tax Expenditures - Losses to the U.S.
treasury from granting certain deductions,
exemptions, or credits to specific categories
of taxpayers. Tax breaks are one method
Congress uses to promote certain policy
objectives. For example, deductions for
mortgages encourage home ownership,
while credits for childcare expenses allow
single parents to work. Tax expenditures are
an alternative to direct government spending
on policy programs.

Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) -
A program that permits the Secretary of the

was initially set by the Emergency Economic
Stabilization Act of 2008 at $700 billion in
assets outstanding at any one time and
remains in effect until October 3, 2010. The
TARP’s activities have included the
purchase of preferred stock from financial
institutions, support to automakers and

Call Centers (per-minute and/or per-sale fees)
There are generally two classes of call centers: order takers and commissioned reps. Interview each
provider you consider to understand the options and costs involved.

The former is a good option if you give the product price in an advertisement (hard offer), are offering
free information (lead generation), or don’t need trained salespeople who can overcome objections. In
other words, your ad or website is pre-qualifying prospects.

The latter would more appropriately be called “sales centers.” Operators are commissioned and trained
“closers” whose sole goal is to convert callers to buyers. These calls are often in response to “call for
information/ trial/sample” ads that don’t feature a price (soft offers). Expect higher costs per sale.

or was not privileged. We don't take jury evidence on that,
you know, Judge Marra's ruling, and therefore, that should be
excluded. So that is item number 19.

Let me turn then to item 20, and I'm handling that.

This is essentially a hearsay exercise. We want information to

b xcluded regarding Rebecca Boylan. Why? Because Rebecca

Boylan has not been deposed and is not going to be a witness in
the case.

As we understand what the defendant is planning to do,
she's planning to call Mr. Dershowitz. Mr. Dershowitz is going

to say Ms. Boylan told him that Ms. Giuffre told him something,

and so we have the classic hearsay within a hearsay situation.

The problem, of course, is that Boylan is not here.

The defendant's pleadings say, ah-hah, but this is an

admission by Ms. Giuffre, and it would be if Ms. Boylan were on
the stand so we could ask her questions about, well, did

Ms. Giuffre really say that? And what did she mean? And

wasn't she saying that she's been abused by Ms. Maxwell? But

they want to skip over that intermediate stuff, have Dershowitz

describe what Boylan describes Ms. Giuffre said, and that's

obviously -- and then I'm assuming Dershowitz is going to put

his spin on what Ms. Boylan allegedly said to him. There are

no set of circumstances in which that hearsay within hearsay

could be admissible because Ms. Boylan has not been deposed,

and is not here, it's rank multiple hearsay.

eventually Ms. Maxwell says, you know, I'm not really sure what

he went to jail for. It had something to do with, she

thinks -- Ms. Maxwell teenage prostitution or under-age

prostitution or something like that. That certainly doesn't

give you the ability then to ram in 400 pages of uncorroborated

hearsay under the idea that somehow this is notice to somebody.
And I think there is one other factual claim that they
make about, you know, what Ms. Maxwell should have known, which

is not the standard. It is not incumbent upon an individual

defendant to go investigate things. That's not the standard.

It seems to me that they have conceded that these

documents are hearsay because they're saying, we're not

offering them for the truth of the matter asserted; we want to

offer it for this knowledge theory that we have.

So I've briefed the issue about business records,

which they are not. I've briefed the issue about government
police records, which they are police records, but essentially
the same tests for business records applies to police records,
which is, you have to be under a business duty to record the

information, and court after court after court after court,

across the country, has said, people in police reports, like

witnesses, are not under a business duty as part of the police
department. So all of those statements, the second- and

thirdhand hearsay statements, are inadmissible, either as

government records or police records or whatever you want to

about the dangers of cybernetics, in part he’s trying to compete against the kind of
portentous language that people like Oppenheimer [used]: ‘When I saw the explosion at
Trinity, I thought of the Bhagavad Gita—I am death, destroyer of worlds.’ That sense,
that physics could stand and speak to the nature of the universe and airforce policy, was
repellent and seductive. In away, you can see that over and over again in the last
decades—nanosciences, recombinant DNA, cybernetics: ‘I stand reporting to you on the
science that has the promise of salvation and the danger of annihilation—and you should
pay attention, because this could kill you.’ It’s a very seductive narrative, and it’s
repeated in artificial intelligence and robotics.”

As a twenty-four-year old, when I first encountered Wiener’s ideas and met his
colleagues at the MIT meeting I describe in the book’s Introduction, I was hardly
interested in Wiener ’s warnings or admonitions. What drove my curiosity was the stark,
radical nature of his view of life, based on the mathematical theory of communications in
which the message was nonlinear: According to Wiener, “new concepts of
communication and control involved a new interpretation of man, of man’s knowledge of
the universe, and of society.”’ And that led to my first book, which took information
theory—the mathematical theory of communications—as a model for all human
experience.

In a recent conversation, Peter told me he was beginning to write a book—about
building, crashing, and thinking—that considers the black-box nature of cybernetics and
how it represents what he thinks of as “the fundamental transformation of learning,
machine learning, cybernetics, and the self.”

Important Information Division

¢ Structured Investments. Structured investments are complex, involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Investors in structured investments assume the credit risk of the issuer or
guarantor. If the issuer or guarantor defaults, you may lose your entire investment, even if you hold the product to maturity. Structured investments often perform differently from the asset(s) they
reference. Credit ratings may pertain to the credit rating of the issuer and are not indicative of the market risk associated with the structured investment or the reference asset. Each structured
investment is different, and for each investment you should consider 1) the possibility that at expiration you may be forced to own the reference asset at a depressed price; 2) limits on the ability to
share in upside appreciation; 3) the potential for increased losses if the reference asset declines; and 4) potential inability to sell given the lack of a public trading market.

* Tactical Tilts. Tactical tilts may involve a high degree of risk. No assurance can be made that profits will be achieved or that substantial losses will not be incurred. Prior to investing, you must
determine whether a particular tactical tilt is suitable for them.

* U.S. Registered Mutual Funds / Exchange Traded Funds (“ETFs”) or Exchange Traded Notes (“ETNs”). You should consider a fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses,
and read the summary prospectus and/or the Prospectus (which may be obtained from your PWM Team) carefully before investing, as they contain this and other relevant information. You may
obtain documents for ETFs or ETNs for free by 1) visiting EDGAR on the SEC website at http:/Avww.sec.gov/; 2) contacting your PWM team; or 3) calling toll-free at 1-866-471-2526. Unlike
traditional mutual funds, ETFs can trade at a discount or premium to the net asset value and are not directly redeemable by the fund. Leveraged or inverse ETFs, ETNs, or commodities futures-
linked ETFs may experience greater price movements than traditional ETFs and may not be appropriate for all investors. Most leveraged and inverse ETFs or ETNs seek to deliver multiples of the
performance (or the inverse of the performance) of the underlying index or benchmark on a daily basis. Their performance over a longer period of time can vary significantly from the stated daily
performance objectives or the underlying benchmark or index due to the effects of compounding. Performance differences may be magnified in a volatile market. ETFs are redeemable only in
Creation Unit size aggregations and may not be individually redeemed; are redeemable only through Authorized Participants; and are redeemable on an in-kind basis. The public trading price of
a redeemable lot of the ETFs may be different from its net asset value. These ETFs can trade at a discount or premium to the net asset value. There is always a fundamental risk of declining
stock prices, which can cause losses to your investment. Commodities futures-linked ETFs may perform differently than the spot price for the commodity itself, including due to the entering into
and liquidating of futures or swap contracts on a continuous basis to maintain exposure (i.e., “rolling”) and disparities between near term future prices and long term future prices for the underlying
commodity. ETFs and ETNs linked to commodity futures do not offer direct exposure to the commodity’s spot price and may perform differently than the spot price for the commodity itself.
Performance differential can be magnified if a specific condition persists in the market for a commodity that creates a disparity between near-term future prices and long-term future prices and
may lead to unexpected performance results. Other factors, such as roll yield, transaction costs, management fees, and taxes may cause deviation in performance between the spot price of a
commodity and commodity futures. You should not assume that a commodity-futures linked ETF will provide an effective hedge against other risks in your portfolio.

to delve into the technologies involved in its production, distribution, and reception. “As
an art historian, a lot of my questions are about what kind of art we can make, what kind
of thought we can make, what kind of ideas we can make that could stretch the human
beyond our stubborn, selfish, ‘only concerned with our small group’ parameters. The
Philosophers and philosophies I’m drawn to are those that question the Western
obsession with individualism. Those are coming from so many different places, and

they re reviving so many different kinds of questions and problems that were raised in the
1960s.”

She has recently turned her attention to the history of cybernetics. Her MIT
course, “Automata, Automatism, Systems, Cybernetics,” explores the history of the
human/machine interface in terms of feedback, exploring the cultural rather than
engineering uptake of this idea. She begins with primary readings by Wiener, Shannon,
and Turing and then pivots from the scientists and engineers to the work and ideas of
artists, feminists, postmodern theorists. Her goal: to come up with a new central
paradigm of evolution that’s culture-based—“communalism and interspecies symbiosis
rather than survival of the fittest.”

As a historian, Caroline draws a distinction between what she has termed “left
cybernetics” and “right cybernetics”: “What do I mean by left cybernetics? In one
sense, it’s a pun or a joke: the cybernetics that was ‘left’ behind. On another level, it’s a
vague political grouping connoting our Left Coast: California, Esalen, the group that
Dave Kaiser calls the ‘hippie physicists.’ It’s not an adequate term, but it’s away of
recognizing that there was a group beholden to the military-industrial complex,
sometimes very unhappily, who gave us the tools to critique it.”

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028661.txt,"on a motorbike parked on the sidewalk outside the Tehran home of
Masoud Alimohammadi; the nuclear physicist was killed when it was
detonated by remote control.

In the broadcast, Fashi accurately described the Mossad campus north of
Tel Aviv. He said he had been given a laptop equipped with a second
operating system and used it to communicate through online drop boxes.
He was impressed by his handlers’ thoroughness. At one point Fashi
described studying a scale model of Alimohammadi’s street. “It was an
exact copy of the real one,” Fashi said. “The tree next it, the street curb,
the bridge.” In a later broadcast, he was seated across from
Alimohammadi’s widow, who glared at him as he bowed his head and
wept. Mossad officials were “pissed off and shocked” seeing their agent
on television, the intelligence official said.

Fashi was executed in May 2012. About the same time, Iran’s intelligence
minister announced the arrest of 14 more Iranians, eight men and six
women dubbed members of the “Terror Club” in the subsequent_prime-
time broadcast of that name. Filmed in shadow, and rich in atmospherics,
the Aug. 5 program recreated Alimohammadi’s death and four subsequent
attacks: they started with the Nov. 29, 2010 nearly simultaneous attempts
on Majid Shariari and Fereydoun Abbasi, nuclear scientists driving to
work when magnetic “sticky bombs” were attached to the side of their cars
from passing motorcycles. Abbasi managed to escape before it detonated,
saving his wife as well. Shariari was killed — a significant setback for the
Iranian nuclear program where he was the top scientist, according to a
Western intelligence official.

The confessed agents offered absorbing detail — they were aboard a Bajaj
Pulsar, wearing helmets, when the magnet bomb stuck on the right front
panel of Shariari’s car exploded. The riders scrambled into the “trail car”
assigned to follow the target and disappeared into the traffic of the Imam
Ali Autobahn. Already gone was the car assigned to cut off and slow the
car carrying the scientist. They claimed to have rehearsed on a practice
track inside Israel. None of the details could be confirmed, but an
intelligence official acknowledged: “Another network was taken.”

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013099.txt,"10.6 Conclusion 183

Correspondence Principle tells us something about what this tuning should involve — namely,
making a system possessing mind-state sequences that correspond meaningfully to world-state
sequences. CogPrime’s overall design and particular cognitive processes are reasonably well
interpreted as an attempt to achieve this for everyday human goals and environments.

One way of extending these theoretical ideas into a more rigorous theory is explored in Ap-
pendix ??. The key ideas involved there are: modeling multiple memory types as mathematical
categories (with functors mapping between them), modeling memory items as probability dis-
tributions, and measuring distance between memory items using two metrics, one based on
algorithmic information theory and one on classical information geometry. Building on these
ideas, core hypotheses are then presented:

® asyntax-semantics correlation principle, stating that in a successful AGI system, these
two metrics should be roughly correlated

e a cognitive geometrodynamics principle, stating that on the whole intelligent minds
tend to follow geodesics (shortest paths) in mindspace, according to various appropriately
defined metrics (e.g. the metric measuring the distance between two entities in terms of the
length and/or runtime of the shortest programs computing one from the other).

® acognitive synergy principle, stating that shorter paths may be found through the com-
posite mindspace formed by considering multiple memory types together, than by following
the geodesics in the mindspaces corresponding to individual memory types.

The material is relegated to an appendix because it is so speculative, and it’s not yet clear
whether it will really be useful in advancing or interpreting CogPrime or other AGI systems
(unlike the material from the present chapter, which has at least been useful in interpreting
and tweaking the CogPrime design, even though it can’t be claimed that CogPrime was derived
directly from these theoretical ideas). However, this sort of speculative exploration is, in our
view, exactly the sort of thing that’s needed as a first phase in transitioning the ideas of the
present chapter into a more powerful and directly actionable theory.

e Federal prosecutors made the unprecedented demand that Mr. Epstein pay a
minimum of $150,000 per person to an unnamed list of women.they referred to as
minors and whom they insisted required representation by a guardian ad litem. Mr.
Epstein’s counsel later established that all but one of these individuals were actually
adults, not minors. Even then, though demanding payment to the women, the
USAO eventually asserted that it could not vouch for the veracity of any of the
claims that these women might make.

e Federal prosecutors made the highly unusual demand that Mr. Epstein pay the fees
of a civil attorney chosen by the prosecutors to represent these alleged “victims”
should they choose to bring any civil litigation against him. They also proposed
sending a notice to the alleged “victims,” stating, in an underlined sentence, that
should they choose their own attorney, Mr. Epstein would not be required to pay
their fees. The prosecutors further demanded that Mr. Epstein waive his right to
challenge any of the allegations made by these “victims.”

e The Assistant U.S. Attorney involved in this matter recommended for the civil
attorney, a highly lucrative position, an individual that we later discovered was
closely and personally connected to the Assistant U.S. Attorney’s own boyfriend.

e Federal prosecutors represented to Mr. Epstein’s counsel that they had identified
‘(and later rechecked and re-identified) several alleged “victims” of federal crimes
that qualified for payment under 18 U.S.C. § 2255, a civil remedy designed to
provide financial benefits to victims. Only through state discovery provisions did
we later learn that many of the women on the rechecked “victim list” could not
possibly qualify under § 2255. The reason is that they, themselves, testified that
they did not suffer any type of harm whatsoever, a prerequisite for the civil recovery
under § 2255. Moreover, these women stated that they did not, now or in the past,
consider themselves to be victims.

e During the last few months, Mr. Herman, First Assistant Sloman’s former law

partner, has filed several civil lawsuits against Mr. Epstein on behalf of the alleged
“victims.” It is our understanding that each of Mr. Herman’s clients are on the

Dear Ms. Knowles-Carter, 
Tel: 
Fax: 
I am writing now to invite you to be a featured guest of Poetry in America 
(poetryinamerica.org). Poetry in America's first season's guests included Bill Clinton, 
Joe Biden, Cynthia Nixon, Shaquille O'Neal, Yo Yo Ma, Samantha Power, Herbie 
Hancock, John McCain, Nas, Angela Duckworth, Bono, Regina Spektor, Frank Gehry, 
Stuart Weitzman, E.O. Wilson, and many others. Seasons Two and Three will feature just 
as distinguished a line up. The series airs on public television stations everywhere, 
streams via Amazon Prime and other streaming services, and it is now also airing on a 
variety of domestic and international airlines. 
The poem we'd read and interpret together is by the contemporary poet Evie Shockley, 
and it's called you can say that again, billie. It's a brilliant and beautiful poem that 
speaks back to Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit and evokes a whole history of gender and 
race in the American South. You are the ideal reader for this poem. We would use what 
we filmed together in an upcoming season of Poetry in America. We would also use the 
content in materials that we are creating for K-12 classrooms in partnership with Harvard. 
Everything we create would be educational and non-commercial. 
Thank you for considering this request. I would be very honored to work with you.

Add the extensive FAQ to your website and continue to add answers to common questions as received.
Find local fulfillment companies in the yellow pages under “fulfillment services” or “mailing services.”
If you cannot find one there or at www.mfsanet.org, call local printers and ask them for
recommendations. Narrow the field to those (often the smallest) who will agree not to charge you setup
fees and monthly minimums. If this isn’t possible, ask for at least 50% off both and then request that the
setup fee be applied as an advance against shipping or their other fees.

Limit the candidates further to those who can respond to order status e-mail (ideal) or phone calls
from customers. The e-mail from your “customer service” folder will be provided as copy-and-paste

responses, especially those related to order status and refund requests.4

To lower or eliminate miscellaneous fees, explain that you are a start-up and that your budget is small.
Tell them you need the cash for advertising that will drive more shipments. If needed, mention the
competitive companies that you are considering and pit them against one another, using lower pricing or
concessions from one to get larger discounts and bonuses from the others.

Before making your final selection, ask for at least three client references and use the following to
elicit the negatives: “I understand they’re good, but everyone has weaknesses. If you had to point out
where you’ve had some issues and what they’re not the best at, what would you say? Can you please
describe an incident or a disagreement? I expect these with all companies, so it’s no big deal, and it’s
confidential, of course.”

Ask for “net-30 terms’—payment for services 30 days after they’re rendered—after one month of
prompt payment for their services. It is easier to negotiate all of the above points with smaller operations
that need the business. Have your contract manufacturer ship product directly to the fulfillment house
once you have decided on one and put the fulfillment house’s e-mail (you can use an e-mail address at
your domain and forward it) or phone number on the online “thank you” page for order status questions.

Phase III: >20 Units Shipped Per Week

Now you will have the cash flow to afford the setup fees and the monthly minimums that bigger, more
sophisticated outsourcers will ask for. Call the end-to-end fulfillment houses that handle it all—from
order status to returns and refunds. Interview them about costs and ask them for referrals to call centers
and credit card processors they’ve collaborated with for file transfers and problem solving. Don’t
assemble an architecture of strangers—there will be programming costs and mistakes, both of which are
expensive.

Set up an account with the credit card processor first, for which you will need your own merchant
account. This is critical, as the fulfillment house can only handle refunds and declined cards for
transactions they process themselves through an outsourced credit card processor.

Optionally, set up an account with one of the call centers your new fulfillment center recommends.
These will often have toll-free numbers you can use instead of purchasing your own. Look at the
percentage split of online to phone orders during testing and consider carefully if the extra revenue from
the latter is worth the hassle. It often isn’t. Those who call to order will generally order online if given no
other option.

Before signing on with a call center, get several 800 numbers they answer for current clients and make
test calls, asking difficult product-related questions and gauging sales abilities. Call each number at least
three times (morning, afternoon, and evening) and note the make-or-break factor: wait time. The phone
should be answered within three to four rings, and if you are put on hold, the shorter the wait the better.
More than 15 seconds will result in too many abandoned calls and waste advertising dollars.

complaint in the UK, in other words a legal action, the third

produced over a year ago.

How this document reads at the top, Drafted by

Ms. Maxwell. I have copied direct lines and quotes from

articles, and my comments are in orange after the quote. Th

relevant article that the quotes came from is listed below the

last quote. Below, I think, are some of the irrefutable

contradictions and interesting additional details that can be

used in the letter to the mail and in the following press

Thanks Darren
Good news!

I'm under the impression that checks will be exceptional (they are more cumbersome to handle), and we will
use mostly wires.

Considering the time difference, my heavy travel and my own propension to do things at night and on week-
ends | would much prefer having an internet code and be able to organize everything online when | need to.

When | use Interaudi (my US bank), they can do that, store the recurring beneficiaries, and do wires in
multiple currencies, but | am not familiar with DB.

Of course, you could also have the same access and help me when needed.
Also, your point about bookkeeping is mitigated by the fact that, in any case, | will also need to have
someone keeping track of the receipts and inventory, before shipping proofs to you. In any case there will be

need for some work on my side before final filing is done.

On the other hand, if there is a checks and balances control issue, there could be a cap to my wiring powers
(like the 10 K we discussed), that would be absolutely fine for me if this is the intent.

Please do let me know.

We can also talk about it (in Hawai now, free after 2 PM your time)

In any case, this is good and happy news. I'll review the first list of payments over the week-end.

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021095.txt,"globeandmail.com: Nature memoir is anything but a snooze file://localhost/Users/Lborth/Heinrich %20Book%20Review html

2 of 2

Bernd's chapters here are earnest and humorous, and offer a window into the making of a scientist. But it is the early chapters on Gerd's life that captivate.

Heinrich skillfully recreates his father's story, through correspondence, an unpublished memoir and remembrances, to create a nuanced portrait - at times generous, at

other times hostile.

Gerd never celebrated his son's success as a scientist - at least not outwardly. The conflict between old science and new tainted their relationship, and Gerd's struggle
for recognition in science made him resentful. On the other hand, Bernd struggled for years to see the value in his father's science and to understand his motivations.
The memoir documents this struggle and builds to an ardent defence of his father's choices and of specimen-collecting biology: There was a purpose, an ethic, even

a morality to what naturalists of his time practised; Biology is

history, and no amount of chemistry can explain how or why the different ichneumon wasps came

into being, or what role they play in different ecosystems; Naming before knowing.

Importantly, The Snoring Bird reminds us that science itself evolves, and that scientists are a product of their time and culture. Bernd Heinrich leaves us with no
doubt that in Gerd's youth, the naturalists' reputation shone brightly, and that taxonomy has provided biologists with a framework for thinking about the natural

world, upon which modern biology is built.

But he glosses over the fact that biology is in the midst of a new - some would say revolutionary - effort to catalogue Earth's biological diversity, using a short
sequence of each organism's DNA called DNA barcodes. They have verified past species divisions - those determined by taxonomists such as Gerd - and clarified
others; and, they represent another tool with which to understand and protect this bounty. In barcoding, an old science has become new again - albeit transformed.
But it is proof that to most of us, nature is still a magic show of the highest order, and that the values of naturalists such as Bernd and Gerd Heinrich live on.

Lindsay Borthwick is a science journalist living in Toronto. She first encountered Bernd Heinrich's work as an editor at the science/culture magazine, Seed.

The fact that Trump and his son-in-law had many things in common did not mean they
operated on a common playing field. Kushner, no matter how close to Trump, was yet a
member of the Trump entourage, with no more ultimate control of his father-in-law than
anybody else now in the business of trying to control Trump.

Still, the difficulty of controlling him had been part of Kushner’s self-justification or
rationalization for stepping beyond his family role and taking a senior White House job: to
exercise restraint on his father-in-law and even—a considerable stretch for the
inexperienced young man—to help lend him some gravitas.

If Bannon was going to pursue as his first signature White House statement the travel
ban, then Kushner was going to pursue as his first leadership mark a meeting with the
Mexican president, whom his father-in-law had threatened and insulted throughout the
campaign.

Kushner called up the ninety-three-year-old Kissinger for advice. This was both to
flatter the old man and to be able to drop his name, but it was also actually for real advice.
Trump had done nothing but cause problems for the Mexican president. To bring the
Mexican president to the White House would be, despite Bannon’s no-pivot policy from
the campaign’s harshness, a truly meaningful pivot for which Kushner would be able to
claim credit (although don’t call it a pivot). It was what Kushner believed he should be
doing: quietly following behind the president and with added nuance and subtlety
clarifying the president’s real intentions, if not recasting them entirely.

The negotiation to bring Mexican president Enrique Pefia Nieto to the White House
had begun during the transition period. Kushner saw the chance to convert the issue of the
wall into a bilateral agreement addressing immigration—hence a tour de force of
Trumpian politics. The negotiations surrounding the visit reached their apogee on the
Wednesday after the inaugural, with a high-level Mexican delegation—the first visit by
any foreign leader to the Trump White House—meeting with Kushner and Reince Priebus.
Kushner’s message to his father-in-law that afternoon was that Pefia Nieto had signed on
to a White House meeting and planning for the visit could go forward.

The next day Trump tweeted: “The U.S. has a 60 billion dollar trade deficit with
Mexico. It has been a one-sided deal from the beginning of NAFTA with massive numbers
...” And he continued in the next tweet ... “of jobs and companies lost. If Mexico is
unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming
meeting ...”

At which point Pefia Nieto did just that, leaving Kushner’s negotiation and statecraft as
so much scrap on the floor.

And by the way, we are going to strongly contest that

she's a tax cheat, so your Honor is going to have, I guess,

competing tax information, and jury instructions on whether

personal injury returns have to be reported on your return, all

of which is going to deflect the jury's time and attention, not
to mention the Court's and counsel's, away from the fundamental
issue of did Ms. Maxwell defame Ms. Giuffre. So that's our

response to the initial overview regarding 405, and I'm going

to turn the time over to my colleague now to dive into some

specifics.

MS. McCAWLEY: Thank you, your Honor. I'm going try
to keep this very brief and just touch on some of the
highlights quickly.

the issue of various pieces of different witnesses, whether

their information would come in, and we hit on the issue --—
they brought up the issue of Mr. Freeh, and actually gave

going to sit on the stand and validate the FOIA response.

Well, very clear from the documents they've produced
in this case, if I could hand them up, your Honor, this is the
pages that they produced with respect to Mr. Freeh. And you'll

see on the first page, he gives his conclusion and he says,

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018484.txt,"consent. Not a partner who says, Okay, I guess, in a bored tone, but doesn't actively
say no. Not a partner who is silent and non-reactive, but doesn't actively stop you when
you start having sex with them. Not a partner who seems hesitant, or anxious, or
confused. Enthusiastic consent means an enthusiastic partner: one who is responding
passionately, kissing you back, saying things like Yes or Oh my God, don't stop”... or
a partner who talks to you ahead of time about what will happen, as many BDSMers and
sex workers do, and knows how to safeword or otherwise get out of the situation if you do
something they don't like.

It's worth noting that there are critiques within feminism of the concept of enthusiastic
consent. For example, some feminist sex workers point out that when they have sex for
money, their consent is not exactly enthusiastic, but they still feel that their consent is
real consent, and that their choices must be respected. The same goes for some asexual
people. Asexuality is commonly defined as not feeling sexual attraction to others, but
some asexual people have romantic relationships with other people in which they have
sex entirely to satisfy their partner, and some of them have said that they don't feel
included by feminist discussions of enthusiastic consent.

Hey, even some of my non-asexual, non-sex worker friends have problems with the idea
that they aren't really consenting unless they're super-enthusiastic about the sexual act
at hand. A married friend once commented wryly that if she and her husband always
demanded 100% enthusiastic consent from each other, then the marriage would fall apart.
But as we continued to discuss it, she and her husband both agreed that they have zero
problem with the situation as it stands.

I don't want to sweep those critiques under the rug. I figure that as long as everyone's
communicating about the situation openly, and working to keep things relatively low-
pressure, then consent is likely to happen, even if it's not perfectly “enthusiastic.” I've had
extensive debates on the topic with other feminists, though, and I often seek more,
because honing consent theory is one of my favorite things!

All this having been said: the concept of enthusiastic consent has been very helpful for
me personally. I know that it's also been helpful for an enormous number of other people
who are trying to understand boundaries in their sexual relationships. I absolutely believe
that enthusiastic consent is an important and useful standard, and I do my best to observe
that standard as much as I can in my own relationships. So, while I think some critiques
are reasonable, I also think that the idea of enthusiastic consent is the best baseline
assumption to start these conversations... if not to end them.

7) In practice, as long as everyone involved is having consensual fun, criticism is
secondary. Practically speaking, consent is the most important thing; from a pragmatic
standpoint, the question of whether sexuality arises from biology or culture doesn't matter
nearly as much. (I find the question of whether BDSM can be categorized as a sexual
orientation to be more politically and theoretically interesting than practically important.)

Understanding sexual biology or culture may help us grasp some of the complexities of
consent. For example, people often have trouble saying no to things directly: when was
the last time you explicitly said no when you didn't want to do something? Which of
the following exchanges is more likely:

denotes a set of sequential steps we can apply to demonstrate this fact.
These steps must have meaning and obey the rules of mathematics, but
what are these rules? Are they written down in a text book?

It turns out there is no way to find this set of rules; it is a super-
infinite task. We would need to reach into our infinite bag of numbers
and pull out rule after rule, turning each into a mathematical model
that explains numbers and logic and what can be done with them to
form mathematical statements. The number of ways to do this is not just
infinity, but two to the power of infinity. This is the number of ways to
permute all possible mathematical rules.

Your mind may be rebelling at this. Surely, if I have an infinite
set of numbers I can just pluck all the numbers from my bag and then
I am certain to have the solution. Unfortunately, it turns out there is
no complete, consistent set of rules; no valid dictionary that maps all
numbers to all of mathematics. That is Gédel incompleteness theorem.

Despite a fundamental limit on mapping all numbers to all of
mathematics, there might still have been an algorithm which could
practically find solutions for a given arbitrary problem. Turing proved
this is not the case.

The Wiles Paradox
Turing showed us there can be no general purpose, mechanical procedure
capable of finding solutions to arbitrary problems. A computer program
cannot discover mathematical theorems nor write programs to do so. Yet
computers regularly solve problems and generate programs. That’s what
software compilers do. This seems to be contradiction.

The solution to this apparent contradiction is to propose a boundary:
a ‘logic limit’ above which computers may not solve problems. With a
high boundary a general-purpose machine could solve most problems
in the real world, though some esoteric mathematical puzzles would be
beyond it. But if the boundary were low, many activities in our daily life
would need some sort of alternative, creative thinking. It is crucial to
know where the logic limit lies.

The Logic Limit

Amazingly, in many branches of science it is possible to pinpoint the exact
location of the logic limit, but finding that boundary in mathematics has
taken forty years work from some of the greatest mathematicians of the
20 century.

systemic explanations. Markets are not like tectonic plates, shifting on their own. Visible hands write
laws and make deals, and in this case a combination of warped values and groupthink seems to have driven
very intelligent men (and they were mostly men) toward folly. In addition to business and government, Mr.
Ferguson aims his critique at academia, suggesting that the discipline of economics and more than a few
prominent economists were corrupted by consulting fees, seats on boards of directors and membership in
the masters of the universe club.

when he challenges some of these professors, in particular those who held positions of responsibility in
the white House or in the Federal Reserve, they are reduced to stammering obfuscation — Markets are
complicated! who could have predicted? I don’t see any conflict of interest -— and occasionally provoked
to testiness. Mr. Ferguson, for his part, cannot always contain his incredulity or rein in his sarcasm.
Occasionally his voice pipes up from off camera, saying things like, “You can’t be serious!”

But it is hard to imagine a movie more serious, and more urgent, than “Inside Job.” There are a few
avenues that might have been explored more thoroughly, in particular the effects of the crisis on
ordinary, non-wall-Street-connected workers and homeowners. The end of the film raises a disturbing
question, as Mr. Damon exhorts viewers to demand changes in the status quo so that the trends associated
with unchecked speculation of the kind that caused the last crisis -— rising inequality, neglect of
productive capacity, endless cycles of boom and bust -— might be reversed.

This call to arms makes you wonder why anger of the kind so eloquently expressed in “Inside Job” has been
so inchoate. And through no fault of its own, the film may leave you dispirited as well as enraged. Its
fate is likely to be that of other documentaries: praised in some quarters, nitpicked in others and
shrugged off by those who need its message most. which is a shame.

“Tnside Job” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some drug and sex references and pervasive
obscenity, though not the verbal kind.

remember Jaffe and all those guys moving into that
space.

Q. If you were building up that space, do you
recall when you put the surveillance in there?

A. It would have been while they were building
it out or shortly thereafter.

Q. During 2009 it seems that you hired lots of
former law enforcement people to work at the firm.
Why were they people you wanted to hire?

A. Severalfold. J had a significant amount of
illegal activity going on with various law enforcement
agencies throughout South Florida and hiring people
from former law enforcement assisted me in engendering
support and camaraderie with the law enforcement that
} was actually utilizing in illegal activities.

Q. So you are saying --

A. Secondarily, ] wanted to have a very strong
investigative team, ultimately, to do both legitimate
and illegitimate things for the law firm, and hiring
former Jaw enforcement was the best way to do that. ]
was hoping to actually ultimately create a group. Ken
Jenne and I had talked about that extensively.

Q. Why did you hire Ken Jenne?

A. Prior to Ken going to prison, he and ] were

very friendly and he was extremely friendly with
someone that was very close to me, Grant Smith.
During the time that he was down in FDC Miami, I went
down to visit him. And after speaking to him and
after speaking to Grant, ] told him, because he was
talking to me about how many people had tumed on him
and abandoned him. And ] told him that when he got
out of jail that he had no worries, that ] would give
him a job.

Q. And what --

A. And that was the primary reason -- that was
my primary reason for hiring him.

Q. What was it you were hiring him to do
exactly?

A. Ultimate the goal was to head up on
investigative arm within RRA, within the RRA entities.

Q. Well, while he was there, since that didn't
happen, what was his obligation to the firm
day-to-day?

A. He handled firm security issues and he did
handle overseeing certain investigative things. We
had an alcohol and beverage group that was forming and
he was overseeing that. He was helping me find new
people to staff it, that kind of thing.

Q. Did you have a lot of interaction --

An old friend approached us with a thick sheaf of what was

purported to be a photocopy of the autobiographical manuscript on which
former President Richard M. Nixon was still at work. Our first reaction was
skepticism. While most of the contents dealt predictably with
contemporary history as it has already been recorded, there were enough
surprises to shock even our own jaded psyche.

Just to be sure, we employed the services of a reputable private
investigative firm. Their report veritied that our source did indeed know an
individual inside the San Clemente hideaway. The next step was to hire a
professional graphologist. who determined the authenticity of Mr.
Nixon’ s handwritten notes on the typed transcript. Finally, our attorneys
assured us that there was no violation of copyright laws involved, because
it was unlikely that Nixon had submitted such unfinished material for
copyright protection.

The book, as yet untitled, is dedicated “To Patricia Ryan Nixon, who

V: In a roundabout way, yes. In so many ways, Jeffrey really really had to train me, and that
was why Ghislaine said that she and Jeffrey enjoyed me so much was because they never
really had to speak much to me to tell me what they wanted me to do. You know, I
wasn’t waiting for you know, their directions. Jeffrey would tell me to go give an erotic
massage to friends. He wouldn’t give me much detail about it, but he would say to treat
them like you treat me.

JS: Did he refer to it as an erotic massage or are those your words?

V: Erotic massage is my words. That’s exactly what it was, but he would tell me to treat
them how he wanted it, so I'd do what he wanted without having to say to me words
more. I mean, I complied with what he wanted because it was somewhat of a, I don’t
know, I don’t know how to say it, it was just very mindboggling how I let him have so
much control or power over me basically. The massages would be routine to what Jeffrey
wanted with my so called new clientele, and with their own words would ask me to
provide them with sexual pleasure after the massage.

JS: Did you ever report back to Jeffrey about what happened when you provided massages to
his friends?

JS: Did Jeffrey ever elicit details from you? “Tell me what happened, describe in detail what
went on?”

V: No, but he would have a laugh, he had a laugh with me a few times about some of their
different mannerisms, I guess you would say, like some of them, one guy had a foot
fetish and that was really weird and I mentioned it to Jeffrey, and we would have a laugh
over it. He didn’t want to know details. He wasn’t asking me “so tell me what did you
guys do exactly.” No, he just basically gave me a slap on the back and said, you know,
good job. And we had some kind of conversation about it. I can’t recall any conversation
off the top of my head. I really don’t know one. It’s been that long. But yeah, we did
talk about it briefly.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028649.txt,"The international community is unlikely to concede to either more
sanctions or the use of force until Iran's objections are taken into full
consideration. As such, a grand deal that is supposed to provoke a moment
of clarity is likely to be enmeshed in the existing, protracted arms-control
process.

Another complication is the advent of public opinion and critical
constituencies in Iran devoted to the perpetuation of the program. The
growing public sentiment is that Iran has a right to acquire a nuclear
capability. As the program matures, it is becoming a source of pride for a
citizenry accustomed to the revolution's setbacks and failures.

Also emerging is a bureaucratic and scientific establishment with its own
parochial considerations for sustaining the nuclear investment. A clerical
leadership that is dealing with a restive population and empowered
security services cannot easily dispense with its nuclear trump card.

All this suggests that the best means of addressing Iran's nuclear challenge
is to mitigate its most dangerous dimensions. The focus should remain on
Iran's high-grade enrichment and its underground nuclear facility nestled
in mountains outside Qom. Tehran seems to have conceived an ingenious
path to nuclear advancement, one that involves increasing the size and
sophistication of its civilian atomic apparatus to the point where it can
quickly surge into a bomb. While staying within the rules of the
International Atomic Energy Agency's inspection process, Iran is
essentially expanding its capabilities while shielding them under the
veneer of legality. Given the fact that much of civilian nuclear technology
can easily be misappropriated for military purposes, Iran can construct an
elaborate nuclear infrastructure while remaining within IAEA guidelines.

The diplomatic challenge is to derail this path to a nuclear weapon by
imposing significant restraints on its program. And this can still be done
through a process that proceeds incrementally and sequentially.

USS. officials would be wise to get out of the crisis mode and put some
time back on the clock. The Iran issue always seems urgent, and yet
somehow there is always time to deal with it. Washington should
acknowledge the obvious, namely, that given Iran's gradualist approach, it

R REPRINT OF THIS STORY 
Just days before a Friday deadline, the Justice Department has reassigned the Jeffrey Epstein victims' rights case to 
the U.S. Attorney's Office in Atlanta, the attorneys representing Epstein's victims' attorneys said Tuesday. 
Miami federal prosecutors, in letter to attorneys for the victims's lawyers on Monday, said they had recused 
themselves from the case, according to Brad Edwards and Jack Scarola, representing Epstein's victims. 
The reassignment means that the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, Byung J. BJay Pak, will 
oversee the case for the government. Pak, a former Georgia lawmaker, was appointed Atlanta's chief federal 
prosecutor by President Trump in October 2017. 
The Justice Department is still under a Friday deadline for prosecutors to confer with the victims' attorneys in an 
effort to settle the case. On Feb. 22, U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra in Palm Beach ruled that federal 
prosecutors, under former Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta, broke the law when they concealed a plea 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031399 
agreement from more than 30 underage girls in Palm Beach who had been sexually abused by Epstein, a 
multimillionaire New York hedge fund manager. 
Marra stopped short of voiding the agreement, which granted Epstein and an untold number of accomplices 
immunity from federal prosecution for sex trafficking crimes, provided Epstein plead guilty to minor charges in state 
court. At the time of the plea deal, federal prosecutors had gathered enough evidence against Epstein to write a 53-
page federal indictment, court records show.

An investigation by the Miami Herald, Perversion of Justice, found that after Acosta met privately with one of 
Epstein's lawyers, the government agreed to seal the plea agreement so that no one — not the victims, not even the 
state court judge who sentenced Epstein — would know the full extent of his crimes. Epstein, now 66, was allowed 
to plead guilty to prostitution charges and served 13 months in the Palm Beach County jail, where he was given 
liberal work release, and allowed to travel to New York and his private island in the Caribbean during his 
subsequent house arrest. He was released in 2009, and now divides his time between New York, Palm Beach and the 
U.S. Virgin Islands. 
The Herald interviewed four of Epstein's victims, who were as young as 13 at the time they were abused by Epstein. 
They said they felt betrayed by state and federal prosecutors, who treated them like prostitutes instead of victims. 
Two of them sued the federal government in 2008 under the Crime Victims' Rights Act, which grants crime victims 
the right to be informed about plea deals and to confer with prosecutors. 
Marra, in a 33-page opinion, said prosecutors not only intentionally violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act, but they 
misled the girls into believing that the FBI's sex trafficking case against Epstein was ongoing — when, in fact, 
prosecutors had secretly closed it after sealing the plea bargain from the public record. 
Marra, noting that he reviewed affidavits, depositions and interrogatories, said Epstein worked in concert with 
others to obtain minors not only for his own sexual gratification, but also for the sexual gratification of others. 
The victims' attorneys — Edwards, Scarola and Paul Cassell — have asked the Justice Department to throw out 
Epstein's plea agreement and reopen the criminal investigation. 
Edwards, who brought the victims' rights case against the government, said transferring the case to another 
jurisdiction is a prudent decision. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031400 
I think it's good that we're going to get fresh eyes and a fresh opinion on the way the case was handled, Edwards 
said Tuesday. We were obviously in an adversarial posture with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami because they 
handled the case to begin with. 
Miami's new U.S. Attorney, Ariana Fajardo Orshan — who was appointed by President Trump in September — did 
not respond to a request for comment.

Edwards predicted that it would take some time for Pak's office to review the case, which includes more than 500 
docket entries and thousands of documents. He said If the sides can't agree on a resolution, then Marra would likely 
have to come up with one. The case is being closely watched by crime victims' rights advocates, as it will likely set 
a precedent. 
Acosta, who was appointed by Trump as the U.S. secretary of labor in 2017, is the focus of a separate Justice 
Department investigation into whether there was any prosecutorial misconduct in the Epstein case. That probe, by 
the DOJ's Office of Professional Responsibility, was initiated in response to demands from a bipartisan group in 
Congress, led by Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of 
Florida. 
In the meantime, a court hearing will be held at 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York in another Epstein-related case. A 
federal appeals court will hear oral arguments in a motion by the Miami Herald, supported by 32 other news 
organizations, asking the court to unseal documents that could reveal details about the extent of Epstein's crimes and 
any other people who may have been involved. 
Three of Epstein's former attorneys — who helped negotiate his plea deal in 2008 — wrote a letter published in the 
New York Times on Monday, defending the plea bargain cut with Acosta as a fair deal. The letter was in response to 
a Times editorial that called on Congress and the Trump administration to hold Acosta and others involved in the 
case accountable. 
Epstein's lawyers said the editorial's conclusions were in profound conflict with the reality, noting that there was 
no evidence that Epstein committed federal sex trafficking offenses. The letter was signed by former Epstein lawyers 
Kenneth Starr, Jack Goldberger and Lilly Ann Sanchez, as well as Epstein's current attorney, Martin G. Weinberg.

this Alert with your regular Sadis &

information can be found at the end of 
the Alert. 
On December 18, 2015, President Obama signed into law a bill that significantly reforms the provisions 
of the Internal Revenue Code that were originally added 35 years ago by the Foreign Investment in 
Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (FIRPTA). The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (the 
PATH Act) also includes extensions of a number of tax relief provisions that expired at the end of 
2015. The PATH Act makes foreign capital investment in U.S. real estate, energy and infrastructure 
assets more attractive by expanding certain exemptions from FIRPTA and clarifying the application of 
certain FIRPTA provisions to REITs and their shareholders. 
I. FOREIGN PENSION FUNDS EXEMPTED FROM FIRPTA TAXATION 
One of the most significant provisions of the PATH Act is the addition of a complete exemption from 
FIRPTA for qualified foreign pension funds and entities wholly owned by such funds, effective on 
the date of enactment. A foreign pension fund is qualified if it is subject to government regulation 
and certain reporting requirements in its home jurisdiction, is established to provide retirement or 
pension benefits to participants or beneficiaries that are current or former employees, has no greater 
than 5 percent beneficiaries, and enjoys tax benefits on either contributions or investment income in 
its home jurisdiction. The new exemption applies to direct investments and investments made 
through partnerships (including private equity funds). The PATH Act provides for certain details to be 
addressed by Treasury Regulations. It appears that the entities eligible for the FIRPTA exemption 
could include a U.S. or foreign blocker corporation that is wholly owned by a qualifying foreign 
pension fund. This exemption will, for the first time, permit foreign pension funds, including some 
governmental funds, to hold control positions in REITs without losing their FIRPTA exemption. 
Note that the regular rules of the Internal Revenue Code other than FIRPTA still would apply to the 
foreign pension fund. Therefore, a foreign pension fund that invested in a partnership that was 
engaged in a U.S. business (real estate or non-real estate) would still be subject to U.S. federal income 
tax on its share of the partnership's effectively connected U.S. business income in the same manner 
as other non-U.S. persons making an investment in a U.S. business partnership. 
Here are some examples of what can be done in light of the changes made by the PATH Act: 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026830 
A. Raw Land Investment. A qualifying foreign pension fund invests in a partnership that buys raw land 
in the United States. (This could be a vacant lot, timberland, oil and gas or mineral property, or other 
property interests that qualify for treatment as real property for federal income tax purposes.) The 
investment is a capital asset, as the partnership is not engaged in business. The partnership later sells 
the property to a developer, or the pension fund sells its partnership interest. Under prior law, the 
foreign pension fund's non-business capital gain would automatically be subject to US federal income 
tax because of FIRPTA. Under the new law, the foreign pension fund's long-term or short-term capital 
gain is exempt from U.S. income tax and FIRPTA withholding because FIRPTA does not apply. 
B. Equity Kicker Mortgage Loan Investment. A foreign pension fund acquires an ownership interest 
in a mortgage loan secured by U.S. real property. The loan includes stated interest plus an equity 
kicker (e.g., additional interest equal to a share of gain realized on sale of the property). Such an 
equity kicker loan is treated as a U.S. real property interest under FIRPTA. Under prior law, gain 
realized by the foreign pension fund upon sale of the loan would automatically be subject to U.S. 
income tax under FIRPTA. Under new law, the gain realized on the sale of the mortgage loan would 
be exempt from U.S. income tax. (This conclusion is based on the assumption that the foreign pension 
fund is a mere investor and not engaged in an active lending business in the U.S.) 
C. U.S. Blocker Corp. Investment. A foreign pension fund wants to make an equity investment in a 
U.S. real estate business that is organized as a partnership. The foreign pension fund forms a U.S. 
corporation to acquire the partnership interest and the corporation is capitalized with a mix of equity 
and debt held by the shareholder. The corporation is subject to U.S. income tax on its net income, but 
gets to deduct interest paid or accrued on the debt held by the shareholder. The foreign corporation 
later sells the stock of the corporation. Under prior law, the gain on sale of the stock would be subject 
to U.S. income tax because the corporation was a U.S. real property holding corporation under 
FIRPTA. Under new law, FIRPTA does not apply to the foreign pension fund, so the capital gain on sale 
of the stock is exempt from U.S. income tax. Note that the U.S.-source interest paid to the foreign 
shareholder could be subject to U.S. withholding tax under the regular rules of the Code, but if the 
pension fund is organized in a jurisdiction that has a tax treaty with the U.S. (e.g., UK, Germany, 
France, China, Japan, etc.), these interest payments could be exempt from U.S. withholding under such 
tax treaty. 
2. FIRPTA EXEMPTION FOR INVESTMENTS IN PUBLICLY TRADED REIT STOCK INCREASED FROM 5 
PERCENT to 10 PERCENT 
For publicly traded REITs, the PATH Act opens the door to increased investment by expanding the 
current statutory exemption from FIRPTA for small portfolio investments by non-U.S. persons. The Act 
provides all foreign investors (not just pension funds) can now own up to 10 percent of the stock of a 
publicly traded REIT without triggering FIRPTA tax. Under prior law, FIRPTA tax would apply upon the 
foreign investor's sale of stock of the publicly traded REIT or the receipt of certain distributions from 
such REIT if the foreign investor holds more than 5 percent of the REIT's stock. 
3. CLARIFICATION OF THE EXEMPTION FOR INVESTMENTS IN DOMESTICALLY CONTROLLED REITS 
The PATH Act includes important clarifying presumptions that will allow publicly traded REITs and their 
shareholders to rely with greater confidence on the current law FIRPTA exemption for gains realized 
on sales of stock in domestically controlled REITS. In determining whether a REIT is domestically 
controlled, the REIT is now permitted to presume that any owner of less than 5 percent of any publicly 
traded shares of the REIT is a U.S. person, unless the REIT has actual knowledge to the contrary. 
4. REVENUE RAISING PROVISIONS RELATING TO FIRPTA AND REITs 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026831 
The PATH Act includes certain revenue raising provisions to offset, in part, the tax revenue loss 
anticipated to result of the above-described tax reform provisions of the Act. Such revenue raisers 
include (among other technical changes) the following provisions: 
A. Increase in FIRPTA Withholding Rate. The purchaser of a U.S. real property interest from a non-
U.S. person was previously required to withhold 10 percent of the purchase price under FIRPTA. The 
PATH Act increases this rate to 15 percent for dispositions occurring after the 60th day following 
enactment, but maintains the 10 percent rate for sales of residential property for between $300,000 
and $1,000,000. This provision is not a tax increase but is designed to ensure that FIRPTA withholding 
collects a sufficient portion of the taxes owed. 
B. Restriction on REIT Spin-offs. In recent years, it has become increasingly common for large 
corporate taxpayers to reduce their tax bills by contributing real estate used in their businesses to a 
subsidiary, spinning off the subsidiary in a tax free transaction under Code section 355, and then 
having the spun-out corporation making a REIT election. The PATH Act curtails such activity by (i) 
providing that neither the distributing corporation nor the spun-out corporation can make a REIT 
election for ten years after that corporation was involved in a Section 355 transaction and (ii) denying 
tax-free treatment to spin-offs in which the distributing corporation or spun-out corporation (but not 
both) is a REIT. 
5. CONCLUSION 
The revisions to the FIRPTA and REIT rules discussed above represent a potentially large expansion of 
the incentives for foreign investment in U.S. real property interests, especially for foreign pension 
funds. Sponsors of U.S. real property investment funds and foreign investors with interests in U.S. real 
estate assets should review the new provisions to determine whether such persons could benefit from 
such U.S. tax law changes.

Topics: On lessons learned running the Stratford Inn

In short, “one-size-fits-all” rules for business ignore the reality of the market place. And setting thresholds for
regulatory guidelines at artificial levels--e.g., 50 employees or more, $500,000 in sales--takes no account of other
realities, such as profit margins, labor intensive vs. capital intensive businesses, and local market economics.

The problem we face as legislators is: Where do we set the bar so that it is not too high to clear? I don't have
the answer. I do know that we need to start raising these questions more often.

So, there you have it, one of the more remarkable epiphanies in American politics: a paean to entrepreneurship and
government restraint from one of its most progressive members. Public epiphanies like this are rare, but there have been
others. Last year, Al Gore conceded that first-generation ethanol was “not good policy” given its low energy conversion ratios,
and said he had supported ethanol out of “a certain fondness for the farmers in the state of lowa because I was about to run for
president.* In 2008, former Fed Chair Greenspan conceded that his Ayn Rand philosophies regarding regulations and
shareholder self-interest were flawed. Perhaps the most famous epiphany was from Robert McNamara, Secretary of Defense
and one of the principal architects of the Vietnam War. In 1995, he conceded that he was “wrong, terribly wrong” about the
war. George McGovern was one of the war’s fiercest opponents, saying on the floor of the Senate, “I'm tired of old men
dreaming up wars for young men to fight”.

There may be no magic elixir of policies to speed the adjustment the US faces. Look at it this way: the US is trying the mega-
stimulus route, while the UK has accelerated its fiscal austerity program. Yet both countries are struggling with below-trend
growth and employment. Perhaps after a debt binge, there are no easy answers, other than time. What to do next? McGovern’s
article suggests that an overly interventionist public sector may be the wrong answer, given the unintended consequences.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026783.txt,"One of the major tax raising provisions in the Tax Act is a one-time tax imposed on the accumulated
earnings held in foreign subsidiaries of US companies. This provision is broader that it may first
appear. Under the Tax Act, any 10% US shareholder of a foreign corporation (determined on December
31, 2017) will be required to include in income, for the taxable year 2017, its proportionate share of the
foreign corporation's undistributed earnings, if the foreign corporation is either a controlled foreign
corporation (CFC) or has at least one 10% US shareholder that is a corporation.

This law change could generate significant phantom income with respect to 10%-or-greater owned
foreign portfolio companies both (i) for US taxable investors (including the general partner and its
owners) in partnership funds organized in the United States and/or for US sponsors of non-US
funds. The Tax Act provides for reduced tax rates on such income for corporate investors of 8% (for
earnings invested in tangible business assets) and 15.5% (for cash and cash equivalents), and 9.05% and
17.54% for investors taxed as individuals.

5. Tax-Free Section 1031 Like Kind Exchanges Eliminated Except for Real Property Transactions

The Tax Act eliminates the ability to qualify for tax-free exchange treatment under Code section 1031 if
the property being exchanged is personal property. Consequently, for transactions occurring after
December 31, 2017, exchanges of artwork, equipment, vehicles or other personal property held for
investment or for use in a business, including Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, for like kind property
will not eligible for Section 1031 tax treatment. Exchanges of real property continue to be eligible for
Section 1031 exchange treatment.

6. Certain Tax Accounting Rules Have Been Revised

Under prior law, net operating losses (NOLs) could be carried back two years and carried forward for
twenty years. Under the Tax Act, NOLs arising in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 generally
cannot be carried back, but can be carried forward indefinitely. However, only 80% of a company's
taxable income is permitted to be offset by NOLs. The remainder of the unused NOLs will carry forward.

The Tax Act also expands the category of corporations and partnerships that are eligible to use the cash
method of accounting. Certain businesses may derive a tax benefit by switching from the accrual
method to the cash method of accounting.

7. Deferred Compensation

The Tax Act generally leaves the current tax rules for deferred compensation intact. However, the Act
also includes a new deferral provision for certain types of broad-based employee equity, which may
apply to certain private companies.

8. Estate and Gift Tax Changes

In 2017, an individual could give or transfer at death up to $5,490,000 without paying gift or estate taxes.
The Tax Act doubles the federal estate and gift tax unified exemption amount for estates of decedents
dying and gifts made after December 31, 2017, and inflation adjustments will continue to
apply. Therefore, in 2018, an individual has approximately an $11.2 million exemption, and a married
couple has approximately $22.4 million of available shelter from federal gift and estate taxation. Note
that the large exemption which applies to gifts may be useful in federal income tax planning. For
example, large lifetime gifts of appreciated securities, artwork and other personal property (including
possibly, a carried interest) to relatives who are in lower income tax brackets, or who reside in states
with lower, or no state income taxes could save the family substantial federal income and/or state
income taxes when such property is sold by the recipient of the gift.

End of Mideast Wholesale

Thomas L. Friedman



May 7, 2011 -- If you look into the different “shop” windows across the Middle East, it is increasingly apparent that the Arab uprisings are bringing to a close the era of “Middle East Wholesale” and ushering in the era of “Middle East Retail.” Everyone is going to have to pay more for their stability. Let’s start with Israel. For the last 30 years, Israel enjoyed peace with Egypt wholesale — by having peace with just one man, Hosni Mubarak. That sale is over. Today, post-Mubarak, to sustain the peace treaty with Egypt in any kind of stable manner, Israel is going to have to pay retail. It is going to have to make peace with 85 million Egyptians. The days in which one phone call by Israel to Mubarak could shut down any crisis in relations are over. 

Amr Moussa, the outgoing head of the Arab League and the front-runner in polls to succeed Mubarak as president when Egypt holds elections in November, just made that clear in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. Regarding Israel, Moussa said: “Mubarak had a certain policy. It was his own policy, and I don’t think we have to follow this. We want to be a friend of Israel, but it has to have two parties. It is not on Egypt to be a friend. Israel has to be a friend, too.” 

Moussa owes a great deal of his popularity in Egypt to his tough approach to Israel. I hope he has a broader vision. It is noteworthy that in the decade he led the Arab League, he spent a great deal of time jousting with Israel and did virtually nothing to either highlight or deal with the conclusions of the 2002 U.N. Arab Human Development Report — produced by a group of Arab scholars led by an Egyptian — that said the Arab people are suffering from three huge deficits: a deficit of freedom, a deficit of knowledge and deficit of women’s empowerment. 

The current Israeli government, however, shows little sign of being prepared for peace retail. I can’t say with any certainty that Israel has a Palestinian partner for a secure peace so that Israel can end its occupation of the West Bank. But I can say with 100 percent certainty that Israel has a huge interest in going out of its way to test that possibility. The Arab world is going through a tumultuous transition to a still uncertain destination. Israel needs to do all it can to get out of their story, because it is going to be a wild ride. 

Alas, though, the main strategy of Iran, Syria, Hezbollah and Hamas will be to drag Israel into the Arab story — as a way of deflecting attention away from how these anti-democratic regimes are repressing their own people and to further delegitimize Israel, by making sure it remains a permanent occupier of Palestinians in the West Bank. 

Have no illusions: The main goal of the rejectionists today is to lock Israel into the West Bank — so the world would denounce it as some kind of Jewish apartheid state, with a Jewish minority permanently ruling a Palestinian majority, when you combine Israel’s Arabs and the West Bank Arabs. With a more democratic Arab world, where everyone can vote, that would be a disaster for Israel. It may be unavoidable, but it would be insane for Israel to make it so by failing to aggressively pursue a secure withdrawal option. 

The second group that will have to pay retail for stability is the Arab monarchies — Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Jordan, Morocco. These governments have for decades bought stability with reform wholesale — by offering faux reforms, like reshuffling cabinets, that never amounted to real power sharing — and by distracting their people with shiny objects. But these monarchies totally underestimate the depth of what has erupted in their region: a profound quest for personal dignity, justice and freedom that is not going away. They will have to share more power. 

The third group I hope will have to pay retail is Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood. Under Mubarak, in an odd way, the Brotherhood had it easy. Mubarak made sure that no authentic, legitimate, progressive, modern Egyptian party could emerge between himself and the Muslim Brotherhood. That way, Mubarak could come to Washington once a year and tell the president: “Look, it’s either me or the Muslim Brotherhood. We have no independent, secular moderates.” 

Therefore, to get its votes, all the Muslim Brotherhood had to say was that “Mubarak is a Zionist” and “Islam is the answer.” It didn’t have to think hard about jobs, economics or globalization. It got its support wholesale — by simply being the only authentic vehicle for protest against the regime. Now the Muslim Brotherhood is going to have to get its votes retail — I hope. 

This is the key question: Will a united, legitimate, authentic, progressive, modern, nationalist alternative to the Muslim Brotherhood get its act together and challenge the Islamists in the Egyptian elections, and then rule effectively? Woody Allen famously pointed out that 80 percent of life is showing up. Wrong. Eighty percent of life is getting stuff done. The Egyptian centrists from Tahrir Square now need to show that they can form parties to get good stuff done. Nobody pays wholesale anymore.

Is This the End of the Assad Dynasty?

Patrick Seale

  

2011-05-06 -- The disturbances started in mid-March in Daraa, a southern city on the border with Jordan, when a dozen children were manhandled, arrested and carried off to Damascus for scribbling hostile graffiti on a wall. Distraught parents came down into the street to vent their anger at such heavy-handed brutality. They were soon joined by others. The uprising had begun and soon spread across the country. No doubt it was inspired, in part at least, by the display of people power which has leapt with contagious speed from one country to another, shaking the foundations of Arab autocracy and giving a great jolt to the immobile political order in the Middle East.

In Syria, the authorities then made what may prove to be a fatal mistake. In a move that looked like panic, the security forces used live fire against the protesters -- and have continued to do so. By the end of April, over 550 people had been killed in different locations around the country, while many more were wounded and possibly two thousand arrested. With little reliable information coming out of Syria it is impossible to be certain of the figures. The state used particular violence against Daraa, a poor city in an agricultural region which has suffered from government neglect and crippling drought in recent years. As if to punish it for initiating the troubles, tank fire was used to quell the protests and something like a siege put in place. Electricity and water were cut off and food became scarce.

The deaths in Daraa and elsewhere -- and the emotional funeral processions that followed -- have clearly aroused great rage in the population and a thirst for revenge. President Bashar al-Assad’s legitimacy has been eroded. A strident call is ringing out increasingly for the fall of the regime. The president is now fighting for his political life and for that of the regime put in place in 1970 by his father, the late President Hafez al-Assad.

Forty-one years in power

The rule of the Assads, father and son, has now lasted 41 years, a score comparable to that of other long-lasting Arab autocrats, each apparently determined to be a président-à-vie. In no other part of the world have so many rulers clung so assiduously to power. Bashar appears genuinely to have believed that the Arab nationalist ideology he inherited, his opposition to Israel and his support for resistance movements such as Hizbullah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, gave him immunity from popular discontent. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal on 31 January, he claimed that Syria could not be compared to Egypt. “Why is Syria stable,” he asked, “although we have more difficult conditions? Egypt has been supported financially by the United States, while we are under embargo by most countries of the world. We have growth although we do not have many of the basic needs for the people. Despite all that, the people do not go into an uprising. So it is not only about needs and not only about reform. It is about the ideology, the beliefs and the cause that you have. There is a difference between having a cause and having a vacuum.”

Unfortunately for Bashar, this analysis has proved wrong. As if caught unawares, his first public speech on 30 March was a public relations disaster. It was delivered to an obedient parliament, which interrupted him repeatedly with acclamation and crass plaudits. In an aside, he seemed to concede that external crises had distracted him from making the reforms he had intended when he first took office. In a second speech on 16 April to his newly appointed cabinet, he announced the lifting of the hated state of emergency, in force since the Ba’ath Party seized power in 1963, and the abolishing of the dreaded Special State Security Court. But even these moves came to seem half-hearted when it emerged that demonstrations could only be held with prior permission from the interior ministry.

The difficult and perilous task Bashar now faces is nothing less than the profound restructuring -- under great popular pressure -- of a fossilised system of governance inherited from his father, but which is no longer appropriate to the modern age, and no longer tolerated by the bulk of the population. Like other Arabs, Syrians want real political freedoms, the release of political prisoners, an independent judiciary, the punishment of corrupt bigwigs, a free press, a new law on political parties allowing for genuine pluralism (and the cancellation of article 8 of the constitution which enshrines the Ba’ath Party as “the leader of state and society”), and an end, once and for all, to arbitrary arrest, police brutality and torture.

Can Bashar meet these demands? Does he have the will and ability to do so? Can he hope to prevail over the entrenched interests of his extended family, of his intelligence and army chiefs, of powerful figures in his Alawite community, of rich Sunni merchants of Damascus traditionally allied to the Assad family, and of the small but powerful “new bourgeoisie,” made rich by the transition from a state-controlled to a market-oriented economy, over which he has himself presided in the past decade? All these disparate forces want no change in a system which has brought them privilege and wealth. Above all, can Bashar change the brutal methods of his police and security forces? Could anyone in just a few weeks hope to change habits of repression ingrained over half a century, and indeed far longer? (For autocracy is not an Assad invention.)

The Bashar years

Until the outbreak of the crisis, Bashar al-Assad had little or nothing of the menacing pose of a traditional Arab dictator. His manner was modest and, at 45, he looked astonishingly young. His tall willowy frame has none of the robustness of a fighter, while his gaze, questioning and often perplexed, has none of the certainties of a man born to power. He was a young doctor studying ophthalmology in London when the accidental death in 1994 of his elder brother, Basil, an altogether tougher character who was being groomed for the succession, propelled him somewhat reluctantly onto the political scene.

The country he came to rule in 2000 seemed backward in an increasingly globalised and technologically advanced world. His first reforms were therefore financial and commercial. Mobile phones and the internet were introduced. Private schools and universities proliferated. In 2004 private banks and insurance companies were allowed to operate for the first time, and a stock exchange was opened in March 2009. A political and economic alliance was forged with Turkey (and visas abolished), which allowed trade to grow along that border, benefiting Aleppo. The Old City of Damascus was revitalised, ancient courtyard houses restored and hotels and restaurants opened to cater for the growing number of tourists. Before the crisis erupted, Syria was negotiating to join the World Trade Organisation and conclude an association agreement with the European Union.

But Bashar’s years in power seem to have hardened him. He developed a taste for control -- control over the media, over the university, over the economy (through cronies such as his exorbitantly rich cousin Rami Makhlouf), control over society at large. Free expression is not allowed. Political decision-making is restricted to a tight circle around the president and security services. Like his father, Bashar clearly does not like to be pushed around or to seem to yield to pressure. Even so, many Syrians still support him in the belief that, as an educated, modern and secular ruler, he is better placed than most to bring about necessary change.

At the time of writing, Bashar still seems to have a chance, if a slim one, of stabilising the situation and perhaps earning a further spell in power -- but only if he calls a halt to the killing of protesters and takes the lead of the reform movement, and in effect carries out a silent coup against the hardliners.

But it may well be too late for that. Indeed, Bashar may already have lost authority to men like his brother, Maher al-Assad, commander of the regime’s Republican Guard, who seems to advocate crushing the protests by force. If the army and the security services remain loyal, it will be difficult for the opposition to unseat the regime. But there have been ominous rumours of army defections as well as reports that some members of the Ba’ath Party have resigned.

It needs to be recognised that the Assad regime does have determined enemies, at home and abroad, who conspire against it in the neighbouring countries -- Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and also Israel -- and among Syrian exiles in London, Paris and the US. These enemies have smelled blood. Riding on the turbulent wave of popular dissent, they will not easily give up. According to US diplomatic cables, released by WikiLeaks and published in mid-April in The Washington Post, the State Department secretly financed a London-based network of Bashar’s opponents to the tune of $12m between 2005 and 2010.

A continuous whole

It is probably fair to view Bashar al-Assad’s term of office and that of his father as a single continuous whole. Not only did Hafez al-Assad decide that Bashar should succeed him, but he also bequeathed to him an autocratic system based on an all-powerful centralising presidency, and a set of principles and external allies and opponents which together determine Syria’s foreign policy. Bashar’s whole career -- like that of his father before him -- has been shaped by Syria’s contest with Israel. Syria has had to live, fight and survive in a hostile Middle East environment shaped by Israel’s overwhelming victory over the Arabs in the 1967 war, its seizure of extensive Arab territories including Syria’s Golan Heights and its subsequent close alliance with the United States, which put in place a sort of dual US-Israeli regional hegemony from which Syria and its allies have sought to free themselves ever since. The 1973 war waged by Egypt and Syria to recover lost territories and force Israel to negotiate a global peace had some initial success but failed to realise its objectives. Instead, Egypt made a separate peace with Israel in 1979 and was removed from the Arab line up. The rest of the region was then exposed to the full force of Israeli power.

Looking to its defences, Syria established a partnership in 1979 with the newborn Islamic Republic of Iran. And once Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 in a bid to expel Syrian influence, destroy the PLO and bring Lebanon into its orbit, Syria found local allies among the Shia resistance movements of South Lebanon -- of which Hizbullah became the most prominent. Waging a guerrilla war, and benefiting from logistical support and weapons from Iran and Syria, Hizbullah managed to force Israel out of South Lebanon in 2000, after an 18-year occupation. From this was born the Tehran-Damascus-Hizbullah axis, which over the years grew into the principal regional challenger of the United States and Israel.

Both the United States and Israel have done their utmost to disrupt this axis and prevent it acquiring any effective deterrent capability: Iran has faced constant demonisation, sanctions and threat of military attack because of its nuclear programme, while Israel has made repeated attempts to destroy Hizbullah, including its war on Lebanon in 2006. Syria, in turn, has faced intimidation, isolation, US sanctions and an Israeli attack in 2007 on its alleged nuclear facility.

Bashar has had to wrestle with his own crises. He survived George W. Bush’s “global war on terror” after 9/11, then faced the greater ordeal of the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq and the long occupation that followed. Had the United States been successful in Iraq, Syria would have been the next target, as pro-Israel neocons, the main architects of the Iraq war, had intended. Syria was then confronted by the 2005 Lebanese crisis, triggered by the assassination of former prime minister Rafik Hariri. Syrian forces were ousted from Lebanon and the Assad regime threatened with extinction by the combined pressures of the United States and France.

There is also a much older memory that still hangs like a dark cloud -- that of the massacres at Hama in central Syria in 1982. It was then that Hafez al-Assad put down, with great violence, an armed insurrection by the Muslim Brothers. Beginning in 1977, this Islamic group had launched a series of terrorist attacks against the regime, murdering several of the president’s close associates and eventually seizing control of Hama, where they killed Ba’ath Party and government officials. The regime regained control of the town, but only after a bloodbath in which between 10,000 and 20,000 people lost their lives.

Thirty years later, some Islamists still dream of revenge, while minorities such as the Alawites fear that if the regime were to fall, they would be massacred in turn. Emerging from underground, the Muslim Brothers have now called on the people to join the protests. The cry for freedom risks being drowned by sectarian strife.

Such has been Bashar al-Assad’s harsh apprenticeship. He has had to surmount a series of regime-threatening crises much like those his father confronted in his time. Both Assads felt some satisfaction at managing to survive them and thus provide Syria with a measure of stability and security, especially compared with Iraq and Lebanon. There was, however, a price to pay. Having to live and survive in a hostile environment inevitably conferred great powers on the security services, guardians of the regime -- to the increasing resentment of ordinary Syrians. A dialogue of the deaf ensued. The Assads’ intense preoccupation with external crises led them to neglect the internal scene. Who would need political freedoms, they no doubt thought, if given the benefits of security and stability? As the regime’s official daily newspaper Tishrin wrote on 25 April: “The most sublime form of freedom is the security of the nation.”

The recent explosion of popular anger has evidently taken Bashar by surprise, as it did other Arab autocrats. He has had to wrench his attention away from the perils and excitements of foreign policy to urgent challenges at home. To devise and implement far-reaching domestic reforms, as the present situation urgently demands, will require a radical change of focus. It will not be easy, and a favourable outcome is far from certain. Bashar now faces an internal threat to his regime at least as dangerous as any of the external threats he and his father confronted so successfully.

                    THE AGE OF DECEPTION

                    Nuclear Diplomacy in Treacherous Times

                    By Mohamed ElBaradei

                    340 pp. Metropolitan Books/Henry Holt & Company. $27.



May 6, 2011 -- The Nobel laureate Mohamed ElBaradei has stated his intention to “nominate myself” to be president of Egypt, but this memoir will not improve his election prospects. In personal terms, it’s hard to imagine anything less thrilling to Egypt’s street revolutionaries than ElBaradei’s accounts of his meals (“The food was very basic, with few choices: noodles, meat and kimchi; no fruit or salad”) and accommodations (“a worn, drab-colored suite consisting of a bedroom and a salon”) in places like North Korea. Nor will his fellow Egyptians be much intrigued by the details of his battles against nuclear proliferators. At the moment, the protestors have other priorities. 

On the other hand, foreign policy leaders and wonks everywhere will find plenty in this memoir to stir debates about the most vital task for global survival — the need to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, especially to rogue states and terrorists. 

That quest is ElBaradei’s story. For decades he was an intimate participant in dramatic nuclear proliferation confrontations that dominated headlines. He served as a senior official at the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear watchdog and inspection arm, for 13 years (1984-97) before rising to its director-generalship in 1997. He resigned in 2009 after completing his third term and announced his interest in running against President Hosni Mubarak in the election scheduled for this year. In 2005, he and the agency were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their nonproliferation endeavors. Doubtless the Norwegian selectors, always ready to needle American hawks, also sought to reward his bold critique of the American-led war against Iraq, especially since they drew ill-tempered ripostes from top officials in the Bush administration, particularly “Dick Cheney and his faction.” 

In many ways, this David-Goliath confrontation over Iraq both drove ElBaradei in his years atop the I.A.E.A. and also inspired this memoir. The Iraq story is well known. The Bush team insisted that Saddam Hussein — who had cheated on nukes and chemical weapons once before and been caught — had or was on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons, and they demanded I.A.E.A. inspections of Iraq to confirm it. The agency conducted 247 inspections at 147 sites in Iraq from November 2002 until March 2003 and found no violations and no nuclear weapons. Nonetheless, the United States insisted on its own “evidence” and went to war. There can be no exaggerating the negative effects of this experience on world opinion toward the United States and upon ElBaradei himself as I.A.E.A. chief. 

ElBaradei’s self-proclaimed mission became preventing another Iraq-type war. To this end, he significantly upgraded the agency’s inspection capabilities, building on the work of his predecessor, Hans Blix. At the same time, ElBaradei decried American counterproliferation efforts as warmongering. These campaigns provided the three themes of his memoir: the need to strengthen the mandate and standing of the I.A.E.A., to restrain sword-waving by the great powers (read the United States), and to emphasize diplomacy and collective security instead. 

First, and not surprisingly, ElBaradei is well aware of the atomic energy agency’s handicaps. For one, its inspections are generally restricted to Non-Proliferation Treaty members and only to those sites declared by those members. Extending this limited mandate to other sites requires a strong push from the United Nations Security Council. The agency has only some 2,300 employees, a very tight budget of about $450 million and limited intelligence-gathering resources. Of course, ElBaradei wants to buttress inspection authority and capabilities. He wants more intelligence-sharing from the big powers. He is particularly angry at Washington for not disclosing its intelligence that Syria was building a nuclear facility, and then for doing nothing to stop Israel from bombing that facility in 2007. He also pushes for tougher safeguards for nuclear material and for moving control of the developmental stages of the “fuel cycle” from national to international hands. 

This is all sensible but probably not attainable. While the United Nations does a number of things quite well, it is not very adept or courageous when it comes to sensitive political matters and national prerogatives. Take, for example, the curious fact that the members of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights elected Libya to its chairmanship in 2003, despite its appalling record, because it was “Africa’s turn.” If this is how business is done, it is unlikely that the I.A.E.A.’s board of governors and the Security Council will ever endow the agency with the common-sense powers and capabilities ElBaradei wants. 

Beyond this, ElBaradei insistently describes the United States and other great powers as more the problem than the solution. In a “new era, one characterized by clandestine activity and the willingness of some countries to blatantly deceive,” the Iraq experience showed “that this deliberate deception was not limited to small countries ruled by ruthless dictators.” ElBaradei goes on to fault the United States for offering direct dialogue with North Korea while refusing talks with Iran “without preconditions.” 

He goes on to say that Washington does not seem to understand the actual causes of proliferation, which he writes “were rooted much deeper, in the extreme economic and social inequalities that prevailed between North and South . . . and the conflicts and tensions that continued to fester in specific regions.” Those tensions certainly lead to proliferation, but “economic and social inequalities” have no detectable bearing on why Libya, North Korea, Pakistan, India, Iran, Syria and Israel have pursued nuclear programs. 

ElBaradei passionately advocates making diplomacy the main recourse in counterproliferation — and he’s right to do so. But when he argues that “the increasing distrust between different cultures” form the barrier to “an enduring and collective security” he’s on shaky ground. 

His credo is diplomacy above all else, for however long it takes and whatever the risk that nuclear weapons will be built in the meantime. He exhibits more sympathy for non-Western proliferators and their needs than for the major powers and their security and political concerns. At times, his narrative comes close to condoning the motives of states that seek nuclear weapons. “Iran’s goal is not to become another North Korea — a nuclear weapons possessor but a pariah in the international community — but rather Brazil or Japan, a technological powerhouse with the capacity to develop nuclear weapons if the political winds were to shift, while remaining a nonnuclear weapons state,” he writes. As for Iran’s concealing its nuclear program at Natanz, he says Iran “was not intending to ‘hide’ it per se.” 

And he adds his voice to those who contend that the fight against proliferation can’t succeed unless the established nuclear powers (above all, America and Russia) reduce their stockpiles and move toward nuclear disarmament. It will be many moons and unerringly effective inspections before leaders in Washington and Moscow contemplate such a course. Surely ElBaradei knows this. 

Nonetheless, “The Age of Deception” provides the grist for serious debate even as it helpfully chronicles the International Atomic Energy Agency’s journey and tribulations as it evolved from a relatively obscure group of technicians into an organization with growing international clout. But if those following in ElBaradei’s path think they can combat proliferation without the major powers — particularly the United States — assuming a central role, they are wrong. Checking proliferation will require more innovative and tighter cooperation between the agency ElBaradei loves and the United States, of which he no longer seems especially fond.

Hillary Clinton - Woman of the World

Jonathan Alter



June 2011 -- It was four a.m. when Hillary Clinton’s plane touched down at Andrews Air Force Base, and by midmorning she was in the Oval Office conferring with President Obama. The night before, as her plane was en route from Tunis, they had agreed that the vote of the United Nations Security Council to impose a no-fly zone on Libya meant that it was now decision time on launching a third American war in the Middle East, though no one in the U.S. government dared call it that. Muammar Qaddafi was ramping up his genocidal threats, pledging to show “no mercy” toward his own people (whom he described as “rats”) in the eastern city of Benghazi. Inside the White House, the president quickly settled on an American bombing campaign, but he and the secretary of state thought strongly that Great Britain and France should be seen as taking the lead. They agreed that there was no choice but for Hillary to sit down in person with both British prime minister David Cameron and French president Nicolas Sarkozy. “I’m sorry, Hillary, but you’re going to fly over the Atlantic again,” said Obama, who was about to leave on his own foreign trip, to Brazil. So only hours after landing from Tunis, she was headed back to Paris.

By then it was clear that the “Arab Spring” of 2011 was creating tumult not just in the Middle East but inside the Obama administration. Not since the fall of Communism, in the late 80s, has a U.S. administration faced a chain reaction of foreign crises that seemed so much out of its control.

At first, Hillary looked clairvoyant: in January, when the street protests were still small in Tunisia, she lectured decrepit dictatorial regimes at a conference in Qatar that “the region’s foundations are sinking into the sand.” Within days, demonstrators filled Cairo’s Tahrir Square, a vibrant plea for greater freedom that swiftly spread to Jordan, Yemen, Bahrain, Oman, Libya, and eventually even Syria. But if Madam Secretary could be ahead of the curve, she was also sometimes behind it, caught in a dizzying series of upheavals that left her both exhilarated and exhausted. In early February, Hillary said the regime of Hosni Mubarak was “stable”; he was gone 17 days later. When she felt White House officials were pushing too hard in public statements for Mubarak to resign, Hillary complained to President Obama, who was unmoved. Yet on the big picture, especially the need to isolate the menacing regime in Tehran, the president and his secretary of state fully agreed. They understood immediately that, for all the facile accusations of inconsistency and hypocrisy, a one-size-fits-all foreign policy wouldn’t work. Doctrines, they felt, were for the doctrinaire.

Hillary had been one of the first in the administration to privately raise the issue of a no-fly zone. But she retreated when her main ally in the Cabinet, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, loudly and publicly said a no-fly zone would mean attacking ground positions, and it was a bad idea to get involved in Libya. The White House was searching for a way to arm the rebels—a strategy Hillary found problematic—but also resisted a no-fly zone. “Lots of people throw around phrases like no-fly zone. They talk about it as though it’s just a video game,” White House chief of staff Bill Daley said dismissively.

Hillary decided to push her case on March 12, after the Arab League voted to request action from the U.N. Security Council—an extraordinary decision to break Arab ranks and ask the nations they had for so long denounced as colonialists to help. “Their statement moved her,” said a close aide, adding that two meanings of “moved” applied.

A myth quickly arose that the women in the administration—Clinton, U.N. ambassador Susan Rice, and national-security aide Samantha Power, whose Pulitzer Prize–winning book on genocide was influential in Obama’s thinking—drove the debate. “The idea that the girls pushed the boys into war is ludicrous,” says Anne-Marie Slaughter, who until recently served as director of policy planning at State. “We were dismissed for months as soft liberals concerned about ‘peripheral’ development issues like women and girls, and now we’re Amazonian Valkyrie warmongers. Please.” In truth, the president, as usual, was not persuaded by anyone to change his mind. He was always a reluctant warrior and decided to intervene only when imminent atrocities in Benghazi made sitting on his hands even riskier.

What the women policymakers did do was help mobilize the alliance. Rice worked hard for the broadest possible language in U.N. Resolution 1973, to allow maximum allied flexibility, while Hillary made sure that China and Russia abstained instead of vetoing the resolution.

Hillary already spends much of her life on her plane, but for six crucial days in March she might just as well have used her seat belt as a fashion accessory, flying nearly 20,000 miles on the Washington-Paris-Cairo-Tunis-Washington-Paris-Washington route. On March 14 and 15, she met with Nicolas Sarkozy. The French president was gung-ho to attack Qaddafi, who by then was reversing rebel advances and regaining the offensive. After taking the measure of Mahmoud Jibril, recognized as one of the leaders of Libya’s transitional government, Hillary agreed to U.S. intervention if the U.N. backed it. Viewing television images of the dictator’s brutality from her quarters at the U.S. ambassador’s residence strengthened her resolve. She took to seconding her husband’s much-repeated line that the biggest mistake of his presidency was doing nothing to prevent genocide in Rwanda.

Hillary’s personal connection to Sarkozy helped cement the coalition. In 2010, Sarkozy had gallantly steadied her after a shoe had come off her foot as she climbed the stone steps of the Élysée Palace. (“I may not be Cinderella but you’re certainly my Prince Charming!” Hillary inscribed a photo, which sits in his office.) Now, over mixed fruit and chocolate, the French president took the normal diplomatic flattery a step further in their “bilat” (diplo-speak for bilateral talks). “Hillary, I always like being with you,” he told her. “You are tough. You are smart. You are a good person.”

From Paris, on the 15th, she went with some trepidation to Cairo, where many young protesters still angry about her support for Mubarak refused to meet with her. Others vented to her face in a Four Seasons conference room before the mood changed and they talked about democracy building. Her 10 to 15 minutes in Tahrir Square the next day (where she was greeted cordially) and drop-by in Tunisia on March 17 left her small security detail jittery; the local authorities, her guards felt, had no clue what they were doing. She arrived back in Washington early on March 18 before heading across the Atlantic again. She arrived in Paris at six a.m. on March 19 and set to work rounding up support from other allies.

The rollout of the “kinetic military action” (the ridiculous euphemism used to avoid the word “war”) was botched and misleading. Hillary had little warning before Sarkozy announced that French planes were in the skies over Libya. At her Paris press conference she made it seem, with her frequent references to “they” and “them”—with the U.S. providing “assistance”—that someone else was leading the intervention. Hillary was safely on her plane en route back to Washington on the evening of March 19 when the world would learn that the core of the attack—112 cruise missiles directed at Libyan targets—was largely American. It would be another 10 days before she would go to London to arrange for the military campaign to be handled by nato. Whatever the burden-sharing logistics, the United States was in deep now, on a course that no one could predict.

Madam Secretary

For Barack Obama, the Arab Spring and its aftermath will shape just one critical piece of his record. But, for Hillary Clinton, the swirling challenges of the region are likely to determine her legacy. Many diplomats remain anxious; the world they knew has been upended. Yet they also understand that the months ahead will be Hillary’s moment to help turn those ripples into a permanent tide of reform and renewal.

But Hillary’s intense diplomatic efforts to forge a coalition to go to war in Libya came at the exact worst time, only two months after WikiLeaks, the whistle-blowing Web site run by Julian Assange, began posting thousands of classified State Department cables online. Candid descriptions of foreign leaders (e.g., Putin is the “alpha dog” of a “virtual mafia state”) were published around the world and have already led to the departure of U.S. ambassadors in Mexico and Ecuador, with more fallout on the way. Hillary told staff that she could not fathom how an army private, Bradley Manning, with psychological problems and a drag-queen boyfriend could single-handedly cause the United States unprecedented embarrassment just by labeling massive downloads as Lady Gaga songs.

Several allies needed little comfort. “Don’t worry about it,” one leader told Hillary. “You should see what we say about you.” Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi wasn’t so forgiving. In 2008 the loutish media baron and billionaire had described Barack Obama as “young, handsome and bronzato (bronzed),” but after WikiLeaks he chose to play the victim. It wasn’t clear whether he was genuinely upset about a cable describing him as “physically and politically weak” or merely projecting his anger over allegations in the Italian press about his relationship with a teenage Moroccan belly dancer suspected of prostitution. Either way, he unloaded on Hillary during an awkward one-on-one in Astana, Kazakhstan.

According to a firsthand account I heard an hour afterward in a hallway near the conference room, Berlusconi told Hillary, “The press is all over me. They think the U.S. is saying that I’m vain and stay out all night. I’m tired, Hillary, very tired. I had such a good relationship with ‘Beel,’ ‘George,’ and ‘Barack’—how can they say this about me?” Hillary explained that, as Berlusconi knew perfectly well, the cables were written by mostly lower-level people. “Look, Silvio, you and I have been friends for 15 years. I’ve been there. Nobody has had more things alleged—true or untrue—than me.” Mostly she let him vent. Her background as a politician and long history with Berlusconi and others wounded by the cables helped ease the tensions.

Even as she navigates these choppy waters, Hillary’s own vessel is solid and surprisingly leakproof. One of the least-noticed changes in American public life is how she has been transformed from a subject of constant gossip and calumny into a figure of consequence and little controversy. There are structural reasons: secretaries of state always exist in a zone slightly above grubby politics, which is meant—in theory, at least—to stop at the water’s edge. The right-wing attack machine can apparently concentrate only on one or two villains at a time, and since 2008 it has been Obama’s and Nancy Pelosi’s turn in the barrel, not Hillary’s. I tried for months to find people willing to lace into her. None would, not even politicians and TV blowhards who had once catalogued her distortions and dined out on despising her.

Hillary Clinton is now in her ninth straight year as the Gallup poll’s “America’s Most Admired Woman,” but being a great secretary of state requires more than energy, brains, and celebrity. Dean Acheson helped rebuild Europe after World War II. Henry Kissinger, who acted like the secretary of state for Richard Nixon even before he got the job, engineered the opening to China. But does anyone think Colin Powell left State with a better reputation than he had before becoming secretary? Madeleine Albright and Condoleezza Rice broke the gender barrier and were competent enough, but left no historic imprint. The State Department isn’t called “Foggy Bottom” for nothing.

For any secretary of state, the prerequisite for success is a strong relationship with the president. “He’s hard for her to connect with,” admits one of her top people. “It’s hard for her to break through to the more-than-polite level.” That isn’t meant to suggest chilliness or dysfunction. “Is it Bush-Baker?” the aide continues, referring to the relationship between the first President Bush and James Baker, who was so tight with his boss that he felt obliged to resign as secretary of state to run Bush’s ill-fated re-election campaign in 1992. “No. But there’s a lot of mutual respect, and she feels like she’s always got a shot with him.” Imagine how it feels to be a supplicant, looking for her “shot” at impressing the president. It was only four years ago that Hillary said her main opponent in the Democratic primaries was “irresponsible and frankly naïve” when he promised to meet with the leaders of Iran, North Korea, and other rogue regimes without preconditions during his first year in office. She hasn’t forgotten who turned out to be right on that one.

One day I asked Hillary point-blank how she gets along with Obama, with whom she meets a few times a week when neither is on the road. She gave me a predictable answer, that her relationship is “not only very good professionally but very warm personally.” Of course, “warm” is just another term of art in Washington, where the advice to anyone looking for a friend has long been to get a dog. When I ask for examples, she has to pause before recalling a very public moment: a spring day in 2009 when the weather was so good that the president suggested they go outside, where they were photographed chatting at a picnic table on the South Lawn. “It was exactly what I could have hoped for. It was spontaneous and heartfelt, and we had a good time,” she says. Her second example is a full hug she and the president shared in the Situation Room after the health-care bill finally passed.

She accepted the post, in November of 2008, only after President-Elect Obama—in an inspired move over the objections of many on his campaign staff—twisted not just her arm, she informed friends, but her fingers, toes, and every other bone in her body. The president, for his part, is proud of himself for choosing her. He knows that she represents the United States better than anyone but him and is—to the surprise of many Obama veterans—refreshingly low-maintenance. When budget season arrived this year and the departments all faced drastic cuts, Hillary used a Cabinet meeting to offer tips on how to avoid making cuts that would affect vulnerable people—children, the elderly—and look bad politically. (She recalled that Newt Gingrich’s effort to slash the school-lunch program, which put Gingrich on the defensive, was the real turning point in the 1995 budget debate.) Several second-tier Cabinet members thought it one of the most useful White House meetings they had ever attended.

I’ve interviewed Hillary numerous times since she was First Lady of Arkansas, and it’s usually frustrating. She’s terrific off the record: blunt, ironic, and incisive about people, including her husband. When she cuts to the nub of something and laughs infectiously, you can see why her friends consider her such good company. On the record is tougher, especially when she’s in a job where a single misplaced word can turn into an international incident. It’s not that she doesn’t trust at least some reporters; otherwise she wouldn’t risk private candor. But the distrust for the news media as a species—the sense of being burned and burned again—long ago made her wary and sometimes defensive.

Up, Up, and Away

As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton has flown more than half a million miles to 80 countries in her two and a half years on the job. Her plane looks like Air Force One on the outside, but isn’t as grand on the inside. It’s one of four Boeing 757s that the military fitted with 15 ordinary coach seats for reporters in the rear, a business-class staff workspace with tables in the middle that seats about 25, and Clinton’s quarters up front near an area jammed with communications gear. She spends most of her time in a small private room with a desk, a modest pullout sofa bed, and a flat-screen for secure videoconferencing. The intimacy of the quarters intensified an already awkward trip at the end of February when Samantha Power, who had been forced to resign from the Obama campaign in 2008 after calling Hillary a “monster,” traveled with the secretary of state to a U.N. Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva. Some months before he died, Richard Holbrooke, the legendary special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, had brokered peace between them, but now no one knew what would happen en route. “It was uncomfortable, but everyone was extremely professional,” said one official aboard.

For most of her thousands of hours in the air, Hillary changes out of her trademark pantsuit (yellow is her favorite color for clothes and in the décor of her homes) into a fleece top and sweats. Meals consist largely of fruit and vegetables (she has a special taste for hot peppers) and maybe a scotch or Bloody Mary. “Don’t bring me the dessert!” she loudly tells the flight attendants only moments before sauntering into the staff cabin, brownie already in hand: “I know—I’ve been bad.” Occasional cupcakes with candles are also exempt because Hillary is religious about observing staff birthdays. She resists movies (despite a weakness for anything with Meryl Streep, especially Out of Africa), reads yet more briefing papers than she’s already consumed in Washington, scans news on an iPad, and sometimes manages a few pages of a mystery, but mostly she sleeps, without any pills, often right through landing. “If she couldn’t sleep most of the way,” says Philippe Reines, her longtime press secretary, “she wouldn’t be able to function.”

Some of her best road stories involve Holbrooke, her close friend, a maestro of diplomacy for more than four decades. (Holbrooke was meeting with Hillary in her office last December when he collapsed and was rushed to the hospital, where he later died from a ruptured aorta.) At his Kennedy Center memorial service, which played more like a roast, she recalled that Holbrooke was once, in Pakistan, so insistent on making a point that he followed her all the way into the ladies’ room. On boarding her plane, he would test every seat to see which was the most comfortable, then hound whichever official was assigned to it to trade with him. Hillary especially enjoyed when he would disappear into the airplane restroom and emerge like an oversize Easter bunny in his bright-yellow sleeping suit. “On hearing Winston Churchill’s motto, ‘Never, never, never, never give up,’ [Richard] called Churchill halfhearted,” she said. Hillary thinks this also perfectly captures her own theory of persistence.

Aloft, the secretary of state can often be found with a black binder clip in her hair instead of fastened onto classified documents. It helps. Her stylist, Isabelle Goetz, does her hair in Washington, but on the road—unless the ambassador’s wife can recommend someone good—she takes care of herself. For years she’s routinely done her own makeup, which is easier because she has good skin. And her genes seem unusually strong. Dorothy Rodham, Hillary’s mother, is 92 but looks more like 80. Hillary is 63 but seems a bit younger. She is one of those lucky people who look better—or at least not worse—with age.

All of this is relevant politically because it means that in 2016, when she’s 68, she is unlikely to be written off as too old to run for president. Since the beginning of the year, Hillary has said repeatedly that she will leave office no later than early 2013 and retire from public life. In Bahrain, just before the Middle East upheaval, I heard her be more direct than ever before on the subject: “I’ve had a fascinating and rewarding public career .... I think I will serve as secretary of state as my last public position and then I’ll probably go back to advocacy work, particularly on behalf of women and children, and probably around the world.”

Hillary isn’t as calculating as her public image. The 2000 Senate race, for instance, was practically serendipitous. But it’s hard to believe “Clinton” and “ambition” have been fully sundered. In 2016, the Democrats are unlikely to have anyone better or more acceptable to different parts of the party. The nearer-term options are far-fetched. When Bob Woodward said on CNN last fall that Hillary’s switching jobs with Joe Biden was “on the table,” the reaction inside both the White House and State Department was to scoff. Neither has an incentive to switch. With the Iraq portfolio already in his pocket, Biden gets plenty of foreign-policy action. His bigger concern is staying on good terms with Hillary. In late 2009, he worried that their long and friendly relationship was in jeopardy over Af-Pak policy. He wanted few troops and heavy reliance on Predator drones; she wanted an open-ended, hugely expensive counter-insurgency commitment. The president ended up sending many more troops than Biden wanted—a total commitment of 100,000—but with withdrawal deadlines beginning this year that Clinton, siding with the Pentagon, opposed. To ease the tensions, Biden and Hillary stepped up their breakfasts and lunches where they call each other “dear.”

Uncommon Ground

Hillary has often said that this is the hardest job she’s ever had. It’s not just the constant travel but also the speed and range of the issues she must master. She finds being secretary of state even more taxing than the 2008 campaign, where she could go on autopilot and give the same speech six times in a day, and had heard all the questions before. “With each month there’s more wear and tear,” says Jake Sullivan, a young lawyer and former Rhodes scholar, who has emerged as one of her closest advisers. “But she also gets more energized and comfortable.” A half-dozen of her friends agree that they have never seen her more in her element. “She seems engaged, happy, focused, determined, and very tired from all the travel,” observes Tom Vilsack, an early supporter from his days as governor of Iowa, who is now the secretary of agriculture. “I can’t remember her ever working this much,” says Dr. Irwin Redlener, who has advised her for many years on children’s issues.

Despite running against each other, the president and secretary of state have a lot in common in the way their minds work—more, arguably, than either has in common with Bill Clinton. Staffers have noticed that both Obama and Hillary are methodical, secure, and human-scale when you talk to them; they’re deductive thinkers who drill down into a problem. The former president, by contrast, is discursive, needy, and larger-than-life; he’s an inductive thinker with a connective mind.

Of course, the sense of order and discipline that Obama and Hillary share belies significant differences that may yet re-emerge. Hillary long ago instructed staffers not to look back to the bitter 2008 primaries or criticize Obama, and for the most part they don’t. But late at night, when they’re safely distant from “the seventh floor” (the mahogany-lined part of the State Department where Hillary and the other power players work), aides complain that Hillary’s creative ideas are often stymied by an inexperienced White House that doesn’t understand the role of drama and stagecraft in diplomacy. They say that Hillary is the daring, decisive risktaker, while the president is hampered by slow reflexes and an overly cautious and unimaginative approach. Not surprisingly, Obama hands insist this is wrong. The only significant policy difference between the two principals, they note, was over Afghanistan, where the president’s policy hardly lacked boldness. On Egypt, it was Hillary who early on recommended caution and Obama who insisted that U.S. policy should be to push for an immediate transition. And they offer a domestic example for good measure: had Hillary been president, she would likely have sided with Rahm Emanuel and compromised much earlier on health-care reform, which would have meant a less ambitious bill.

Where the risktaking point might apply is in critical personnel decisions. Hillary likes the challenge of handling big, talented, difficult individuals; it’s what attracted her not just to Bill but also to advisers like Richard Holbrooke. Obama (through then national-security adviser Jim Jones) almost fired Holbrooke. Although Hillary told the White House about her own exasperation with Holbrooke (a position she didn’t advertise after his death), Obama’s treatment of the envoy rankled both Clintons. “I never could understand people who didn’t appreciate him,” Bill Clinton said in his eulogy at Holbrooke’s Kennedy Center memorial service. This was a not-so-veiled shot at people like Obama, who was sitting onstage nearby—the president’s no-drama impatience with certain protean characters extends to his strained relationship with the former president. Hillary is caught in the middle, but doesn’t appear to be making efforts to bring the two most important men in her life closer.

Even so, she works hard to keep the hatchet with Obama buried. This requires staying on good terms with his White House. Hillary has known Tom Donilon, the national-security adviser, since 1978, when he was a 23-year-old political operative. They have lunch once a week, where sometimes—as on the details of Af-Pak escalation—they cordially disagree but know the president will decide anyway. Donilon believes you have to go back to George H. W. Bush’s era to find such “alignment” among national-security principals. “She’s a great team player,” he says.

The biggest problem between State and the White House used to be that Cheryl Mills, Hillary’s chief of staff, clashed with Denis McDonough, the deputy national-security adviser, who is close personally to the president. Now the two remind staffers of an old married couple that quarrel harmlessly. A more significant source of tension is that Hillary has long wanted the president to do more outreach to heads of state. If she had her way, the White House would have held three times as many state dinners and bilateral meetings with foreign leaders in the last two years. That might have helped with all the fence-mending and coalition-building to come.

Smart Power

Being secretary of state isn’t as much fun as it sounds. Imagine having to spend your days saying things like “We must also renew our efforts toward a settlement in Nagorno-Karabakh based on basic principles elaborated under the auspices of the Minsk Group.” That’s Hillary’s life.

Once she accepted the post, she consulted all the living secretaries of state and lots of experts on what she could get done at Foggy Bottom. I ask her what they advised, hoping to get a little closer to how she defines success. “They told me, ‘You can either concentrate on a few big issues that will really make your mark, like China policy, or you can try to better manage the State Department and USAID’”—the United States Agency for International Development, the department’s famously dysfunctional development arm that administers civilian foreign aid—“‘so that everything that’s done is more in line with what you’re trying to achieve over time,’” she recalls. “And I said, ‘I don’t know how you do one without the other.’”

Hillary has already had some successes, most conspicuously her use of American diplomatic leverage in the U.N. Security Council to get China and especially Russia to help isolate Iran and North Korea. She and the president have convinced the Russians that proffering military hardware to Iran isn’t in their national-security interest—a tough sell. And ever since Obama bollixed up his relations with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in 2010, Hillary has worked overtime to soothe Bibi. “She’s indispensable—the only one trusted on all sides [of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict],” says Sandy Berger, who served as Bill Clinton’s National Security Council adviser.

Most conspicuously, Hillary has championed what has come to be known as “civil society.” In practice that means moving beyond the usual contacts between the United States and foreign governments to forge ties with the non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are essential to stability and development. Like her husband, she’s deployed her international stature for “convening power,” bringing together governments and NGOs on a dizzying array of significant projects that would otherwise lack support.

Always a generalist, Hillary thinks concentrating too much on one area is hazardous. “We’ve got a big world out there, and [if] you ignore some part of it, it comes back to bite you,” she tells me. So she has tried to strike a balance between hot spots and the more mundane management decisions that she thinks are necessary to elevate diplomacy and development to the level of defense. That way, the United States would have a more sophisticated, “3-D” foreign policy, looking short-term and long-term, top-down and people-up. Hillary herself shies away from the Cineplex imagery in favor of the notion of “smart power.”

“‘Smart power’ is the use of American power in ways that would help prevent and resolve conflict—not just send our military in,” she says. “‘Smart power’ is closer cooperation between our development experts, our diplomats, our military leaders.” Hillary offers an example: in Afghanistan, the Pentagon has a fund that allows a young American officer to take $100,000 in discretionary funds and rebuild a school on his own authority. By contrast, a diplomat or development expert trying to rebuild a school would spend months filling out forms, Hillary says, and probably still wouldn’t get the money out of Congress. “We need a more agile civilian power,” she concludes.

Hillary draws a distinction between focusing on relations with governments (the locus of diplomacy for hundreds of years) and stimulating change in societies, where the results are less controllable but ultimately more profound. She clearly wants to try both at once, but that intention can break down under the stress of a crisis. In the debate over the bombing of Libya, the “society” policymakers were the hawks. Their argument was caricatured by critics as purely humanitarian but was in fact strategic. The thinking here was that the U.S. must “get on the right side of history” and connect to the aspirations of young people in the region. By contrast, the Old Guard focused on nervous allies like Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Jordan. Seeing the upheaval through the lens of stability, they were doves on the question of bombing Libya, which they thought might detract from the larger aim of containing Iran. Their mantra was “Beware unintended consequences.”

While the Pentagon was clearly opposed beforehand, the other power centers in the government were more conflicted. It wasn’t State versus White House, much less women versus men or old versus young. And this is true moving forward. Some men in the White House are on the “society” side; some women in the State Department are on the “government to government” side. And many officials switch sides (and can switch back again) amid the long hours of debate. The most common sentiment among foreign-policy veterans reflects another familiar Bill Clinton line: “It sure was simpler during the Cold War.”

For Hillary, the crisis mentality must eventually give way to the more mundane realities of running the department. She is midway through a five-year plan to increase the size of the State Department’s foreign-service staff by 25 percent and double USAID. And she’s taken a leaf from the Pentagon playbook and launched a “Q.D.D.R.”—Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. The idea is to ask all the agencies housed at Foggy Bottom the larger questions—like whether they are even focused on the right things. It’s a huge structural project.

Hillary prides herself on sweating the small stuff, too. She’s big on feedback—an intranet “Secretary’s Sounding Board” is bringing the suggestion box into the modern age. She gets high marks from the high-tech community for “21st-century statecraft” like using texting to raise money for Haiti-earthquake victims and an Internet freedom agenda she is pushing aggressively. She’s popular with State Department employees for practical changes like providing full benefits for same-sex partners (“Fix it!” she scolded bureaucrats who were dragging their feet) and building showers to accommodate people who cycle or run to work. In the past, meetings with foreign ministers featured nothing more than bottled water. Hillary was incredulous: “You can get coffee, tea, nuts all over the world, and in Washington you get a bottle of water?” She was told, “That’s the way we do it here.” Her chilly retort: “Not anymore.”

The secretary runs a brisk, no-nonsense meeting. “We present and she interrogates, in the best sense of the word,” says Patrick Kennedy, the undersecretary for management. Received wisdom gets eviscerated. “Jeff, you’ve got to do better than that,” she told Jeffrey Feltman, the assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs, one day when he presented a shopworn idea. With USAID undergoing an overhaul, she listens to every reform report, down to the details of how chlorine tablets for clean drinking water can be transported by truck in Honduras. “She’s looking at the guts of how we work,” says Dr. Raj Shah, who runs USAID.

According to old State hands, Hillary represents some of the better qualities of her predecessors. She has Baker’s obsession with preparation, reaches out like Colin Powell (who advised her to resist the efforts of bureaucrats to strip her of her BlackBerry), and offers continuity with Condi Rice’s policy on aids and Africa. But she might most resemble Ronald Reagan’s second secretary of state, George Shultz, a canny pragmatist who made significant progress in several areas without being associated with a single momentous event. Shultz was known for valuing the “career people” (foreign-service officers) and casting a wide net for advice. Hillary does that, too, though she’s still surrounded by a Praetorian Guard of loyalists from her Senate office who are too political for the taste of some diplomats in the building. (They preferred the military veterans around Powell or academics around Rice.) Her great weakness over the years was too often choosing subordinates based more on loyalty than competence. She has been better about this since moving to State, but still slow to extend her trust.

When she travels, Hillary manages to be simultaneously remote from the media (joint press conferences with foreign ministers are limited to two questions for each) and accessible to the public. Unless a crisis obliterates her schedule, she routinely subjects herself to what Reines infelicitously calls “townterviews,” a combination of university town meeting and television interview featuring a group of effusive local journalists, students, and faculty. The format allows her to promote civil society and human rights without getting in the face of the country’s leaders. Often a questioner will refer to her in fractured English as “President Clinton.” In Asia, this can be especially mortifying for the shy audience. She’ll cheerfully reply “I wish!” or “Almost!” to disarm the situation, before going on to explain how her serving in the government of the man who defeated her is a sign of democracy’s strength. Almost every trip includes meeting with leading women from local NGOs, many of whom line up to tell Hillary with what little English they can muster how inspirational she has been to their efforts. “She has almost singular recall from years back,” says Kurt Campbell, assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific affairs, who recounts being amazed at what she remembered about a group of Chinese women from a path-breaking trip in 1995. “Not just names, but obscure details about people she’s met only once and hadn’t been briefed on.”

State of the Union

No one abroad seems interested in a subject that continues to fascinate Americans—the state of the Clintons’ marriage. The truth, at present, is hardly momentous. “They’ve been in good shape as a couple for way longer than people realize,” says one friend in a position to know. “When things are not good, they’re not good at hiding it.” Wherever Bill’s behavior took the relationship, the friend continues, there remains “a profound level of forgiveness and attachment between them.” Despite heart problems, Bill is in good health, but his weight loss—thanks to a vegetarian diet—has left him looking shrunken in person. The rumors of straying have subsided.

Aides to both claim, implausibly, that the Clintons talk on the phone every day. The former president doesn’t use e-mail (Hillary, by contrast, is a BlackBerry fiend), which makes it hard to be in constant touch.

Chappaqua remains a place for them to spend time together. On weekends, when both are off the road, she often takes the shuttle up from Washington—no government plane—on Friday night and returns to her house on Whitehaven Street in Northwest Washington on Sunday night. They’ll take long walks with their dog Seamus, a chocolate Labrador and the great-nephew of their White House dog, Buddy, who was struck by a car and killed in Chappaqua in 2002. Sometimes they go house-hunting in suburban New York for fun, which leads to unfounded rumors they are about to move. Frequent guests include close staff and old friends like Terry McAuliffe and investors Alan Patricof and Marc Lasry and their families.

Only a few staffers were invited to Chelsea’s wedding, last July in Rhinebeck, New York, including the tiny village of women around Hillary who helped raise her: Maggie Williams, Melanne Verveer, Cheryl Mills, Capricia Marshall (now head of protocol for the government), and Huma Abedin, Hillary’s indispensable “body woman” and surrogate daughter, whose marriage to New York congressman Anthony Weiner the same month as Chelsea’s nuptials made Hillary feel as if she had two weddings in the family at the same time. “Her best friends are work and Chelsea, and now Marc,” a close family associate says, referring to Marc Mezvinsky, Chelsea’s new husband. Shortly before the wedding ceremony began, Bill, Hillary, Chelsea, and Marc went into a room together at the Astor Courts estate for a few minutes with no one else, not even Mezvinsky’s (divorced) parents. “They were three and now they’re four,” one friend says. (Contrary to rumors, Hillary’s aides say that Chelsea’s marriage is going well.)

Never, Never, Never, Never Give Up

When a young man at a town-hall meeting in Kyrgyzstan asks Hillary which designers she wears, she answers immediately: “Would you ever ask a man that question?” The crowd of young people laughed and applauded. Hillary and Bill like to vacation at Oscar de la Renta’s Punta Cana resort, in the Dominican Republic, but she wasn’t about to mention that, or venture that Vera Wang designed Chelsea’s wedding dress. Like Albright and Rice, Hillary wants women’s issues to be substantive. “All the young men on our staff don’t seem to think they’re important,” Hillary remarked archly one day in 2009, an early sign of the schisms to come. To reinforce the message she named Verveer, her former chief of staff in the White House, to be the first ambassador-at-large for global women’s issues. Even amid the Sturm und Drang of the Middle East and North Africa, she’s liable to leave her imprint in the same areas that brought her into public life in the first place—helping women and children and strengthening civil society. It’s a straight line from the Children’s Defense Fund, where she worked as a young law-school graduate, to Foggy Bottom. From micro-credit to food assistance to education, Hillary knows that women in underdeveloped villages usually spend aid money on their families, while men more often spend it on themselves, which is a polite way of saying on liquor and prostitutes.

Seemingly minor changes can yield huge benefits. “As we meet … as many as three billion people are gathering around open fires or old and inefficient stoves in small kitchens in poorly ventilated houses,” Hillary tells a New York philanthropic audience. “As the women cook, smoke fills their lungs and toxins begin poisoning them and their children,” she explains before noting that the World Health Organization estimates that nearly two million people a year—half of them children—die from pneumonia and other ailments that are likely connected to this problem, more than twice the number of deaths from malaria. She has been involved in this cause for years, but now has a much bigger platform to push the idea of new cookstoves that cost as little as $25 each. “This could be as transformative as bed nets or even vaccines,” she says, the excitement in her voice palpable. “We are excited because we think this is actually a problem we can solve.”

That’s rare. Development challenges and global conflicts often seem intractable, and that has to be a little discouraging at three in the morning in the skies over Kabul or Cairo. “You can’t just look at these conflicts and issues and say, ‘O.K., that’s been solved,’” Hillary says to me at the end of an interview, starting to chuckle. “Because most of these problems are never solved.” Now she’s back in dutiful, dogged mode, which happens to be the mode that best fits today’s Hillary—the one almost everyone seems to like. “You know,” she says, “you just keep working at them and working at them and working at them.” Who can argue with that?

possible for a person to be kind and generous with his friends but still a criminal paying for sex with
underage girls in his private life.

Dear Professor Krauss,

We met briefly after your talk in Ithaca a few months ago — I'm the girl on The Skeptics’ Guide to the
Universe podcast. I've really enjoyed your talks and books, but I was surprised to see you quoted in the
Daily Beast recently defending Jeffrey Epstein:
http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2011-04-01/bill-clinton-katie-couric-woody-allen-jeffrey-

epsteins-society-friends-close-ranks/2/

Can you confirm if the following quote is accurate?

If anything, the unfortunate period he suffered has caused him to really think about what he wants to do
with his money and his time, and support knowledge,” says Krauss. Jeffrey has surrounded himself with
beautiful women and young women but they're not as young as the ones that were claimed. As a scientist I
always judge things on empirical evidence and he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've
never seen anything else, so as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were I would
believe him over other people. Though colleagues have criticized him over his relationship with Epstein,
Krauss insists, I don't feel tarnished in any way by my relationship with Jeffrey; I feel raised by it.”

Thanks,

been captured as part of an “incidental collection” of authorized wiretaps. That is, a
wiretap had presumably been authorized on the Russian ambassador by the secret Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Court and, incidentally, picked up Flynn.

The FISA court had achieved a moment of notoriety after the Edward Snowden
revelations briefly made it a béte noire for liberals who were angry about privacy
incursions. Now it was achieving another moment, but this time as the friend of liberals,
who hoped to use these “incidental” wiretaps as a way to tie the Trump camp to a wide-
ranging conspiracy with Russia.

In short order, McGahn, Priebus, and Bannon, each with prior doubts about Flynn’s
reliability and judgment—“a fuck-up,” according to Bannon—conferred about the Yates
message. Flynn was asked again about his call with Kislyak; he was also told that a
recording might exist. Again he scoffed at any suggestion that this was a meaningful
conversation about anything.

In one White House view, Yates’s tattling was little more than “like she found out her
gitlfriend’s husband flirted with somebody else and, standing on principle, had to tell on
him.”

Of more alarm to the White House was how, in an incidental collection wherein the
names of American citizens are supposedly “masked”—with complicated procedures
required to “unmask” them—had Yates so handily and conveniently picked up Flynn? Her
report would also seem to confirm that the leak to the Post about these recordings came
from the FBI, DOJ, or Obama White House sources—part of the growing river of leaks,
with the Zimes and the Post the leakers’ favored destinations.

The White House in its assessment of the Yates message ended up seeing this as less a
problem with an always hard-to-handle Flynn than as a problem with Yates, even as a
threat from her: the Justice Department, with its vast staff of career and Obama-inclined
prosecutors, had ears on the Trump team.

“It’s unfair,” said Kellyanne Conway, sitting in her yet undecorated second-floor office
while representing the president’s hurt feelings. “It’s obviously unfair. It’s very unfair.
They lost. They didn’t win. This is so unfair. So POTUS just doesn’t want to talk about
it.”

There was nobody in the White House who wanted to talk about—or even anyone who
had been officially delegated to talk about—Russia, the story that, evident to most, even
before they entered the White House, was certain to overwhelm the first year of the Trump
administration at the very least. Nobody was prepared to deal with it.
