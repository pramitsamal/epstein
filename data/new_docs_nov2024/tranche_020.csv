Restructuring the University

It is a miracle that curiosity survives formal education.
—Albert Einstein

When I moved from Stanford to Yale, it was entirely because of the
efforts of Bob Abelson, a psychology professor who became my good
friend and wonderful colleague during the 15 years I was at Yale. Bob
had been instrumental in helping to create the Computer Science
Department at Yale, which is the department that wound up recruit-
ing me( Bob had hoped I would be outside the department structure
since I didn’t really fit in anywhere very well, but he couldn’t win that
argument.)

Bob told me a story about the creation of the Computer Science
Department at Yale, which involved his having to argue with another
faculty member on a university committee about why a department
should be created around a machine. He said that one member of the
committee actually asked him whether there should be a department
of lathe science as well.

We both found this to be pretty funny at the time. Now, however,
I have to admit that the guy had a point.

I have been a professor in quite a few academic departments in
my university career: linguistics, computer science, psychology, edu-
cation, and electrical engineering. These departments all have some
something in common: They have no real reason to exist. One would
assume that departments represent academic disciplines that are co-
herent in some way, but it simply isn’t so. The people in a computer
science department, for example, have in common that they all think
about computer-related issues, but so do people in other disciplines.
Some parts of computer science have more in common with math-
ematics than they do with other parts of computer science. There were
many people in the departments that I was in who worked on things
that I didn’t understand or care about. All our interchanges were about

The House Of The Nobleman

Old Masters are hung in the company of some of the most notorious contemporary artists on the block in a show
opposite Frieze Art Fair

Text by John-Paul Pryor

For what is a man profited, if he gains the whole world and loses his own soul? Perhaps this is one question that
could be asked of any billionaire art collector. In The House of The Nobleman, artist Wolfe von Lenkiewicz
examines our relationship to art and the role of the supposedly worldly or noble collector from a non-
judgemental critical distance, and exhibits art both old and new (from Manet and Cézanne to The Chapmans and
Damien Hirst) in a show that promises to prove contentious. Here, Lenkiewicz’s own “resequenced” Picassos will
be exhibited against their original counterparts, effectively folding art history in upon itself to create an entirely
new kind of dialogue. Dazed Digital went down to his studio to talk nobility, history and the reasons why a lost
battle is a battle one thinks one has lost.

Dazed Digital: What is the concept that informs The House Of The Nobleman?

Wolfe von Lenkiewicz: When | started to plan the exhibition with the co-curator Victoria Golembiovskaya (by
whom | was fascinated because she was instrumental in manoeuvring a submarine in the grand canal in Venice), |
began to think about the notion of quality in the 21st century as opposed to the set of values pursued by Marsilio
Ficino. The dislocation and decertification of a stable position in the world, which was formally the aristocrat, the
king... the noble man. The artist, being perceived at the centre, was seen as a God, and within Ptolemaic
concentric rings one moved from dog, to angel, to God. This is a hierarchical linear model, which has been
attractive for five centuries in one form or another. The idea of this show is to explore a post-humanist form of
compassion — the world is dynamically changing, and no matter how flexible our map may be to quantify it, we
will be in an eternal struggle with meaning.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018293.txt,"waiting for his flight in front of a TV in the crapped-out lobby of an old hotel on the
road out of town, watching Mubarak’s promised speech. The President projected
total confidence on screen. This was the Mubarak Wisner had known in the 1980s.
There had always been a barreling self-assurance about the man; it was alive in him
now, facing the unthinkable. Ruggedly handsome and perfectly controlled. You could
almost believe, as Wisner did for a moment, “This was a great man who had led a
country through difficult times. He will endure.” Six assassination attempts. Mubarak
had always been a survivor.

Yet as he watched, Wisner knew the challenge the great man faced. Did Mubarak, he
wondered? Did he even understand what was happening around him? That he was
giving the speech on television, in the face of this strange revolutionary movement
that was unfolding on the smart phones of Cairo as much as on its streets, was a
subtle admission: Old power struggles to handle new rules. Wisner had seen tapes
of the earlier speeches, the ones intended to calm the crowds which had in fact
inflamed them further. He knew just how fine the edge Mubarak now paced.
Mubarak needed to address the protestors on their own level. He needed to show he
understood. There was only one thing he must not do, Wisner thought as he
watched. He must not address the protesters paternalistically, as a father might
speak to a child. On the screen in front of him, Mubarak continued in his steady,
slightly strident voice. “I am speaking to you all from the heart,” he said. “A speech
from a father to his sons and daughters.”

Two weeks later, Mubarak was gone.
2.

Imagine, for a moment, you are Mubarak - or really any successful early 215' century
autocrat. You’ve managed several decades of control in your Middle Eastern, North
African or Asian country. Perhaps you've inherited your position from your father or
an uncle. They’ve taught you about power. Keep it tightly controlled. Replace key
officials regularly. Execute your enemies from time to time. You’ve learned the
virtues of the hard crackdown. You've sent your security officers to the best military
schools in the US and Europe, and taught them to temper their firm grip with (a bit
of) humanity. In short, you’ve mastered the use of a strong hand and the
establishment of a certain national logic that suggested your name — Qadafi or
Mubarak or el-Abidine ben Ali - as a synonym for stability, for prosperity and even
pride. This seems to you like the most stable possible order. You know that someday
it might have to change, but that day seems a long way off. You delay reform. You
prepare your son to take over. Meanwhile, your citizens begin to acquire the
Internet and cell phones. And one day in 2008, following a financial crisis far away
from your own shores, you begin to notice an unnerving trend.

On the streets of Iceland and then Spain and then Chile and then Israel and Ukraine
and Turkey and Mexico and then New York City, thousands or hundreds of

thousands of citizens gather. There is no one leader of any of these protests. Instead
these movements breathe and grow like an organic whole. The discontent is diffuse

yields one well result every 6-8 weeks as a catalyst to rerate Hess over time.

Liza area moving towards 2bn boe

Operator Exxon recently confirmed the latest exploration test in Guyana ‘Snoek’ as the
latest discovery in the Liza development area, with ~82ft of net pay and in line with pre
drill expectations we are led to believe is in the 200-300mm boe range. Recall from our
discussions with management, Snoek was characterized as a smaller but distinct target,
updip of Liza, but lower risk.

The well was drilled in 26 days to a depth of ~17,000ft in 5,128ft of water 5 miles south
west of Liza #1, as shown in the graphic below; the Stena Carron drill ship has now
relocated to the next well test, the ‘Liza #4’ appraisal, where we anticipate results by
end April but with the possibility of a drill stem test in a success case that may push the
well result into mid-May.

Critically, ‘Snoek’ reinforces management's prior characterization of the Stabroek block
as moving towards a 'DHI play’ meaning the risk profile of incremental exploration
improves - a critical factor for the next well in queue, the Payara #2 appraisal that will
also target a deeper test (Pacuma)} scaled with a pre drill target of ~1bn boe. The next
prospect, Liza lookalike named ‘Turbot will likely be spud around mid-year.

From our discussions with Hess and the operator we summarize our understanding as
follows:

¢ Operator XOM had previously framed the discovered potential in the Liza /
Payara at 1.5bn — 2.0bn boe, subject to completion of two planned additional
appraisal wells. Quoting EVP Mark Albers and CEO Darren Woods

‘The success at Payara combined with the additional oil pay discovered with Liza-3
brings the total discovered resource on the block to somewhere between 1.4 billion oil
equivalent barrels and 2 billion oil equivalent barrels.’

“to clarify, what we have found - not potential upside, but what we have found is 1.4
billion to 2 billion BOE. The upside is mutti-billion barrel unrisked potential’

Zamir said Kucherena rarely saw journalists he that he had a contact in his office. He further told
me Kucherena required that any journalist seeking an interview with Snowden to submit his
questions to him two weeks in advance and, if approved, sign a document stating I would not
deviate from the questions. Next, my questions had to be translated from English to Russian
(even though Snowden does not speak Russian) and then vetted by Kucherena’s staff. Zamir
also suggested I stay at the National hotel in Red Square because Snowden has gone there for
previous meetings with Bamford. So I sent Kucherena, via Zamir, ten questions that might
interest Snowden (if they ever reached him.)

adequate spiritual preparation, ayahuasca could generate transcendent states that
allowed access to ones inner being and the beings of other worlds that could serve
as sources of mystical knowledge and healing. The Shams dervish of the 13
Century, wandering the Turkish portion of the Silk Road, used the word sohbet to
describe the inner land of mystical conversations about mystical subjects that their
turning meditation, whirling, and the shaman’s entheogenic compounds such as
DMT give entrance.

The question was whether our finding of DMT and its human brain enzyme
had been an artifact, an accidental laboratory fluke. Members of my neurochemical
research teams at the University of California Medical Schools in Irvine and La
Jolla, notably Dr. Lee Poth, now a professor of pediatric endocrinology at the
Uniform Services Medical School in Washington D.C., demonstrated that the DMT
synthesizing enzyme existed in the brains of recent accident victims that as far as
we were able to learn from their family and social histories, had been completely
psychologically normal. More than a little bit startled by this finding and worried
about making a sensational scientific mistake, we repeated the experiments with a
variety of controls with the same findings. Though our original estimates of the
human brain enzyme concentration were on the high side, we confirmed the general
finding and published them in Science in 1969 and Nature in 1970. Our carboline
work was published in the Journal of Neurochemistry in 1975. A year or so after our
Nature paper was published, the Nobel Prize winning neuropharmacologist at the
National Institutes of Mental Health, Julius Axelrod, confirmed the presence of the
DMT biosynthetic enzyme that converted the tryptophan product, tryptamine, to
DMT in mammalian brain tissue. We were both delighted and relieved.

We speculate, perhaps too grandly, that this finding, along with the beta
carboline human brain synthesizing capacity, supplies one of many possible
neurobiological and neurochemical mechanisms for the claims of the cross-cultural
universality of mystical experience. We all had human brains with these enzymes.
The idea that the phenomena accompanying primary religious experience were

common to all cultures was a major theme of the life’s work of the philosopher-

(And for the record I often put my hand up in front of a camera if there is a flash, as I specifically request selfies
not to include flashes, so that I don’t end up with a series bright spots in front of my eyes for the next half hour)

What makes this particular type of allegation so repugnant is that I get asked for literally thousands of selfies,
and when people come up to me they are vulnerable, often shaking, and sometimes overly aggressive. I am
particularly proud of the way I attempt to make all people feel at ease, and respected, rather than humiliated.
Thus, this false claim strikes at the heart of what I am about, which is to acknowledge fans in a way that makes
them feel appreciated. As I understand you had a reporter watching me sign books and take selfies at the CFI
conference in Las Vegas this year, that behavior is what they will have witnessed. Moreover, I am proud of the
interactions I have had at both Case and ASU, with students, colleagues and staff. I have had numerous female
graduate students, postdocs, employees, and colleagues, and as ASU attested to you, none of these have ever
complained of harassment. Quite the contrary in fact, as I have worked hard to support them, mentor them, and
treat them with respect. I treat others as responsible adults, and I expect to be treated equally.

As you know, I’m a reporter for BuzzFeed News who has been investigating sexual misconduct allegations

detail.

In particular, you stated in an email sent on Nov 13 that two universities had investigated an incident (# 6
below). You claimed that “both Universities independently concluded that the report was unsubstantiated and
fabricated with malicious intent.” We are not aware that either university concluded fabrication or malicious
intent, so if you have evidence to support this assertion, we would like to see and discuss it.

Mr. DERSHOWITZ. It seems to me you have an interest but no right...I can
understand how you would be offended by that. But one of the prices of living in
a complex society, with freedom, is for you to have to simply tolerate the fact that
you know that certain people are engaging in conduct that you don’t approve of.
That was precisely the argument made by the State of Connecticut in the birth
control [clinic] case.*° They said that people of the State of Connecticut are
offended by knowing that this kind of immoral conduct is being engaged in by
people, married people, all over the State. And the Supreme Court did say that
this is something that members of the society must tolerate in a pluralistic society.
There are a great many things which offend me, to know that they’re going on in
peoples’ homes—I have an interest in that, but I don’t think I have a protected
constitutional right [to be] disturbed about what’s going on.

Judge Julian asked whether “that interest [should] be legally protected?”

Mr. DERSHOWITZ. Now, there may be ways of protecting it, perhaps through zoning
regulations...

But if the issue is total banning on the one hand as against your interests being protected
against knowing people are doing this kind of thing, I would submit that the Constitution
has a clear answer to that. It must permit the film to be shown in a way to minimize your
exposure to it and to permit you both fully to see and to avoid being exposed to the
contents of the film.

So I do submit that your Honor does have an interest and I can understand it. But I think
you will realize that on balance this interest could be used to upset almost every kind of
freedom that Americans ought to be at liberty to engage in.”

Judge Aldrich seemed intrigued by our argument, while continuing to press me hard on its
implications. At one point Judge Aldrich asked me what I would do if the Supreme Court ruled
against my theory. “Will that be the end of the road...?”

I responded: “Well, I, as an attorney, will continue to urge the Court to accept this principle
because I think it’s the correct approach to the regulation of obscenity.”

Following three days of intensive argument and questioning, the three judges issued a decision
written by Judge Aldrich. He bought my argument totally. He began by accepting my assumption
about the nature of the film:

For purposes of this case we assume that the film is obscene by standards currently applied
by the Massachusetts courts.

He then went on to discuss the implications of the Stanley decision, which the prosecutor had
argued was “irrelevant” to this case and which, at the beginning of my argument, thought was not
relevant to movie theaters:

Defendant.

MOTION TO QUASH OR FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER REGARDING
SUBPOENA SERVED ON NON-PARTY JANE DOE NO. 3

Non-party Jane Doe 3, by and through undersigned counsel and pursuant to Florida Rules
of Civil Procedure 1.410(c)(1)', hereby moves for an order quashing the subpoena duces tecum
served on her by Defendant, or alternatively, pursuant to Florida Rules of Civil Procedure 1.280(c)

for issuance of a protective order sharply limiting the scope of the subpoena.
INTRODUCTION

This Court should quash the subpoena issued to non-party Jane Doe No. 3 as it is
unreasonable and oppressive. The Defendant is abusing the subpoena power in an effort to
intimidate, harass and cause undue burden to a non-party. Indeed, Defendant - just days ago -
publicly admitted that his goal of deposing Jane Doe No. 3 has nothing to do with this Florida
Defamation Action; rather, he is trying to find a way to send this victim of sexual trafficking to

“Jail.” “She was hiding in Colorado...but we found her and she will have to be deposed. The end

* For the limited purpose of the Motion to Quash or for Protective Order and resolving the scope of the
subpoena and any enforcement issues, Jane Doe No. 3 voluntarily submits herself to this Court’s
jurisdiction.

crisis of the underpinnings of capitalism, and on top of that we’re now, I believe, at the

beginning stages of a global war against Islamic fascism.

“With all the baggage that those [right-wing]
groups bring — and trust me, a lot of them
bring a lot of baggage, both ethnically and

racially— but we think that will all be worked
through with time.”

Benjamin Harnwell, Human Dignity Institute: Thank you, Steve. That was a
fascinating, fascinating overview. I am particularly struck by your argument, then, that in
fact, capitalism would spread around the world based on the Judeo-Christian foundation
is, in fact, something that can create peace through peoples rather than antagonism,
which is often a point not sufficiently appreciated. Before I turn behind me to take a
question —

Bannon: One thing I want to make sure of, if you look at the leaders of capitalism at that
time, when capitalism was I believe at its highest flower and spreading its benefits to most
of mankind, almost all of those capitalists were strong believers in the Judeo-Christian
West. They were either active participants in the Jewish faith, they were active
participants in the Christians’ faith, and they took their beliefs, and the underpinnings of
their beliefs was manifested in the work they did. And I think that’s incredibly important
and something that would really become unmoored. I can see this on Wall Street today —
I can see this with the securitization of everything is that, everything is looked at as a
securitization opportunity. People are looked at as commodities. I don’t believe that our
forefathers had that same belief.

Harnwell: Over the course of this conference we’ve heard from various points of view
regarding alleviation of poverty. We’ve heard from the center-left perspective, we’ve

heard from the socialist perspective, we’ve heard from the Christian democrat, if you will,

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012867.txt,"When clinicians diagnose individuals with a mental disorder, they are making a statement about
deviance, about what falls within and outside the range of normal mental states. Unfortunately, there are
no clear categories, no bright lines separating normal from abnormal or uncommon. As the distinguished
American psychologist William James noted, however, studying “the abnormal is the best way to
understand the normal.” Let’s follow this logic.

Consider the developmental disorder of autism. This disorder, typified by difficulties
understanding what others believe and feel, ranges from individuals who appear locked out of the world,
rocking back and forth to their own internal rhythm, to high functioning individuals such as Professor
Temple Grandin, who not only teaches college-level courses, but has done wonders as a spokesperson for
autism and for the animal welfare movement. This range already tells us that autism is represented by a
spectrum, once identified by purely behavioral measures, but joined today by genetic and neurobiological
markers. The genetic evidence is particularly helpful for explaining the observed variation. For example,
the MAOA gene, located on the X chromosome, is involved in the regulation of social behavior and has
different forms that map to differences in brain activity and stress physiology. The different forms
correspond to the number of copies of the genetic material. This copy number is, in turn, partially
responsible for the spectrum of autism observed, especially the degree of social dysfunction, including
stress and aggression. Once we admit to a spectrum, and begin to pinpoint the factors that push
individuals to stand on one end or the other, we must admit to admitting virtually everyone onto this
spectrum. All of us, at some point in our life, have lacked sensitivity to the feelings and beliefs of others.
All of us have been self-absorbed and locked out from the rest of the world. All of us have failed to
express empathy and compassion to others. All of us have been a bit abnormal in this sense. All of us
fall, on occasion, within the spectrum of autism as well as other disorders of the mind such as
psychopathy.

Like autism, psychopathy is not one neat and tidy disorder, but a spectrum. Diagnostically,
psychopaths are impulsive, narcissistic, and lacking in social emotions such as empathy, remorse, and
guilt. These behaviorally defined characteristics are complimented by genetic and neurobiological
markers, some pointing to risks in the pre-school years, and linked to the same MAOA gene noted above.
The spectrum that defines psychopaths ranges from hyper-smart, calculating, and powerful politicians to
low IQ, downtrodden, serial murderers. Everyone of us occasionally shows our psychopathic face: self-
absorbed, impatient, manipulative, and uncaring. What is abnormal, then, is living with these
characteristics, all the time. Clinically diagnosed psychopaths, like clinically diagnosed individuals with
autism, have the characteristic traits as stable components of their personality. An honest clinician will
tell you, however, that stability is difficult to define, and so too are the essential traits. An honest brain

scientist will also tell you that, despite the observation that psychopaths have hyperactive dopamine brain

conversation occurred when Mr. Epstein was aboard his privately owned civilian

aircraft in Miami in the Southern District of Florida. His pilot had filed a flight

plan showing the parties were about to return to Teterboro, NJ. After the

conversation with Ms. Groff, Mr. Epstein became concerned that the FBI would

try to serve his traveling companion, Nadia Marcinkova, with a similar grand jury

subpoena. In fact, the agents were preparing to serve Ms. Marcinkova with a

target letter when the flight landed in Teterboro. Mr. Epstein then redirected his

airplane, making the pilot file a new flight plan to travel to the US Virgin Islands

instead of the New York City area, thereby keeping the Special Agents from
serving the target letter on Nadia Marcinkova. During the flight, the defendant
verbally harassed Ms. Marcinkova, harassing and pressuring her not to cooperate

with the grand jury's investigation, thereby hindering and dissuading her from

reporting the commission of a violation of federal law to a law enforcement

officer, namely, Special Agents of the FBI. Epstein also threatened and harassed

Sarah Kellen against cooperating against him as well.

21. | Edwards learned that the Palm Beach police department investigation ultimately
led to the execution of a search warrant at Epstein’s mansion in October 2005. See Police
Incident Report, Exhibit “A”.

22. Edwards learned that at around the same time, the Palm Beach Police Department
also began investigating Epstein’s sexual abuse of minor girls. They also collected evidence of
Epstein’s involvement with minor girls and his obsession with training sex slaves, including
pulling information from Epstein’s trash. Their investigation showed that Epstein ordered from
Amazon.com on about September 4, 2005, such books as: SM101: A Realistic Introduction, by
Jay Wiseman; SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for Erotic Servitude - Principles, Skills, and Tools, by Guy
Baldwin; and Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and Their Owners,
by Christina Abernathy. See Receipt for Sex Slave Books (Exhibit “I’).

witnesses that participated in Epstein’s child molestation criminal enterprise and also provided

When faced with a build-up of Iraqi
forces along its border, Kuwait decided
not to mobilize its military out of fear
that the move would provoke Saddam
Hussein. The incentives for Gulf states to
make similar strategic calculations in the
future will be greater when Iran has an
inventory of nuclear weapons to match its
growing ballistic missile capabilities.

The Gulf states, moreover, will likely
reason that the U.S. capability to threaten
or use force against a nuclear Iran will be
significantly diminished. Even without
nuclear weapons, Gulf states have seen,
in their view, a long history of American
reluctance to threaten or use force against
Iran. For example, the United States took
no direct military action against Iran after
it aided and abetted Hezbollah bombings
against Americans in Lebanon in the
1980s, after Iran supported the bombing
of Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia in
1996, or even after Iran supported the
deadly campaign of improvised explosive
devices (IEDs) against U.S. troops in
Iraq. Gulf states will no doubt judge that
if the United States was unable and
unwilling to attack Tehran under these
circumstances, then it is certainly not
going to attack Iran in the future, when it
will be able to retaliate with nuclear
weapons.

is Sincere in wanting to do the right things, but it is not by nature
revolutionary.”

To their credit, the Egyptian generals moved swiftly to put in place a
pathway to democracy: elections for a new Parliament were set for
September; this Parliament will then oversee the writing of a new
Constitution, and then a new civilian president will be elected.
Sounds great on paper, and it was endorsed by a referendum, but
there’s one big problem: The Tahrir Square revolution was a largely
spontaneous, bottom-up affair. It was not led by any particular party
or leader. Parties are just now being formed. If elections for the
Parliament are held in September, the only group in Egypt with a real
party network ready to roll is the one that has been living
underground and is now suddenly legal: the Islamist Muslim
Brotherhood.

“Liberal people are feeling some concerns that they made the
revolution and the Muslim Brotherhood can now take it. This is not
true,” Esam el-Erian, one of the party’s leaders, insisted to me.

But that is exactly what the urban, secular moderates, who actually
did spearhead the Tahrir revolt, fear. They are only now forming
parties and trying to build networks that can reach the millions of
traditional Egyptians living in the countryside and persuade them to
vote for a reform agenda and not just: “Islam is the answer.”

“The liberal parties need more time to organize,” said Naguib
Sawiris, an Egyptian billionaire who’s heading the best organized of
the liberal parties, and is urging all the liberal groups to run under a
single banner and not divide their vote.

If elections happen in September and the Muslim Brotherhood wins a
plurality it could have an inordinate impact on writing Egypt’s first
truly free Constitution and could inject restrictions on women,
alcohol, dress, and the relations between mosque and state. “You will

Machanaimi, was someone I knew well. When the cabinet convened, he pointed
out to the ministers that the London terrorists were from a fringe Palestinian
group led by Abu Nidal. Far from being an ally of Arafat, he had been
sentenced to death by Fatah. According to Gideon, Begin wasn’t interested in
the distinction. Even less so were the two leading military figures in attendance:
Arik and Raful. They said all Palestinian terror was the responsibility of Arafat,
and that now was the time to hit back hard. The cabinet was informed that our
initial response would be limited: aerial and artillery bombardment of PLO
targets throughout Lebanon. Yet Raful told the cabinet that the Palestinians
would almost certainly respond with shell and rocket fire into Israel. Then, he
said, we could strike more forcefully. In other words, the invasion would begin.

It did. Dubbed “Operation Peace for Galilee” to convey the aim of protecting
northern Israel from shell and rocket fire, it got underway at around 11 a.m. on
Sunday June 6. The publicly declared aim was Little Pines: the establishment of
our 40-kilometer security zone. Both Israelis and the Americans were led to
believe it would be a relatively short operation aimed at destroying the PLO’s
military capacity in the border area. We also said that we wouldn’t attack Syrian
forces as long as they didn’t attack us.

That last public pledge had particular relevance to my role on the ground. I
was deputy commander of the largest of Israel’s three invasion forces, under
Yanoush Ben-Gal, head of the northern command until shortly before the war.
We had 30,000 troops and 600 tanks and were responsible for the “eastern
sector’ — from the edge of the Golan Heights, north through the Bekaa Valley
along Lebanon’s border with Syria. At first, we deliberately stopped short of
Syrian forces. We deployed our main reserve division just 10 kilometers across
the border, below the first Syrian positions at the bottom of the Bekaa. But
despite the public assurances we were in Lebanon to establish our security zone,
we had no orders to halt at the 40-kilometer line. From day one, our part of the
invasion force began a pincer movement around the area of eastern Lebanon
where large numbers of Syrian soldiers were based. My former Sinai division,
the 252™, came down from the Golan and started making its way up alongside
the Syrian border. Our other units, further inland, also began pushing
northward.

For the first couple of days, we did avoid a confrontation with the Syrians.
Yet on June 8, day three of the war, the morphing of Little Pines into Big Pines
began.

a hostile Middle East environment shaped by Israel’s overwhelming
victory over the Arabs in the 1967 war, its seizure of extensive Arab
territories including Syria’s Golan Heights and its subsequent close
alliance with the United States, which put in place a sort of dual US-
Israeli regional hegemony from which Syria and its allies have sought
to free themselves ever since. The 1973 war waged by Egypt and
Syria to recover lost territories and force Israel to negotiate a global
peace had some initial success but failed to realise its objectives.
Instead, Egypt made a separate peace with Israel in 1979 and was
removed from the Arab line up. The rest of the region was then
exposed to the full force of Israeli power.

Looking to its defences, Syria established a partnership in 1979 with
the newborn Islamic Republic of Iran. And once Israel invaded
Lebanon in 1982 in a bid to expel Syrian influence, destroy the PLO
and bring Lebanon into its orbit, Syria found local allies among the
Shia resistance movements of South Lebanon -- of which Hizbullah
became the most prominent. Waging a guerrilla war, and benefiting
from logistical support and weapons from Iran and Syria, Hizbullah
managed to force Israel out of South Lebanon in 2000, after an 18-
year occupation. From this was born the Tehran-Damascus-Hizbullah
axis, which over the years grew into the principal regional challenger
of the United States and Israel.

Both the United States and Israel have done their utmost to disrupt
this axis and prevent it acquiring any effective deterrent capability:
Iran has faced constant demonisation, sanctions and threat of military
attack because of its nuclear programme, while Israel has made
repeated attempts to destroy Hizbullah, including its war on Lebanon
in 2006. Syria, in turn, has faced intimidation, isolation, US sanctions
and an Israeli attack in 2007 on its alleged nuclear facility.

Bashar has had to wrestle with his own crises. He survived George
W. Bush’s “global war on terror” after 9/11, then faced the greater

The Department opposes the statutory language in subsection 1 10(a)(1)(B) that
specifically mentions the U.S. Government sponsored hotlines for reporting instances of-
trafficking in persons. Statutorily providing for the names of the hotlincs would interfcre with
the President’s policy-making authority to change the hotline structure at a later date.
Furthermore, the Act, as written, misnames the hotlines.

10. Section 201

In section 201, the Department objects to the new subsection “(bb).” To the extent that
such a subsection is necessary, a question that we defer to the Department of Homeland Security
(DHS), the decision regarding cooperation should include the Attomey General in addition to the
Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, as it does in Section 201(b).

DOJ defers to DHS in regard to subsection (a)(1)(E), although we would note that by
removing the “unusual and severe harm” standard, victims will be eligible for a T-visa upon a
lower showing of “extreme hardship.”

The Department also defers to DHS in regard to subsection (a)(2), which would extend
T-visas to parents and siblings of trafficking victims. As a factual matter, however, the provision
should be amended to strike any reference to “as a result of the alien’s cooperation with law
enforcement.” Traffickers threaten victims to intimidate them into compliance with traffickers’
demands and to retaliate for victims’ escape, not because of law enforcement cooperation. It is
counter-factual to describe the pattern of threats and retaliation as linked to law enforcement
cooperation, and disregards the fact that threats often only subside when law enforcement takes
measures to secure the family or punish the traffickers and their associates who threaten victims’
families, Furthermore, it is unclear whether the reference to siblings encompasses both minor
and adult siblings, and whether spouses and children of adult siblings would be eligible for a T-
visa, :

In subsection (b), DOJ opposes the new subsection (8)(B), which grants sole authority to
the Secretary of DHS to consider whether “extreme hardship” exists. The new section, however,
also requires consultation with “prosecutors,” which presumably refers to prosecutors at DOJ,
since DOJ is the lead prosecutorial agency for cases involving human trafficking. Since these
prosecutors are under the Attomey General’s authority, the consultation requirement should
include consultation with the Attorncy General.

Subsection (c)(1), which creates the new subsection (3)(A)(i) in section 107(c) of the
Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), should limit applications for continued presence to
those being made by “Federal” law enforcement officials, Limiting the applications to those
submitted by Federal law enforcement assists in the victim identification process. The
Department has established a memorandum of understanding with DHS that ensures that the
Department’s prosecutors are informed when investigators apply for continued presence.
Furthermore, limiting the applications to those submitted by Federal law enforcement ensures the
uniformity of standards in making the determination as to whether an individual is a victim of a

States for offering direct dialogue with North Korea while refusing
talks with Iran “without preconditions.”

He goes on to say that Washington does not seem to understand the
actual causes of proliferation, which he writes “were rooted much
deeper, in the extreme economic and social inequalities that prevailed
between North and South . . . and the conflicts and tensions that
continued to fester in specific regions.” Those tensions certainly lead
to proliferation, but “economic and social inequalities” have no
detectable bearing on why Libya, North Korea, Pakistan, India, Iran,
Syria and Israel have pursued nuclear programs.

ElBaradei passionately advocates making diplomacy the main
recourse in counterproliferation — and he’s right to do so. But when
he argues that “the increasing distrust between different cultures”
form the barrier to “an enduring and collective security” he’s on
shaky ground.

His credo is diplomacy above all else, for however long it takes and
whatever the risk that nuclear weapons will be built in the meantime.
He exhibits more sympathy for non-Western proliferators and their
needs than for the major powers and their security and political
concerns. At times, his narrative comes close to condoning the
motives of states that seek nuclear weapons. “Iran’s goal is not to
become another North Korea — a nuclear weapons possessor but a
pariah in the international community — but rather Brazil or Japan, a
technological powerhouse with the capacity to develop nuclear
weapons if the political winds were to shift, while remaining a
nonnuclear weapons state,” he writes. As for Iran’s concealing its
nuclear program at Natanz, he says Iran “was not intending to ‘hide’
it per se.”

And he adds his voice to those who contend that the fight against
proliferation can’t succeed unless the established nuclear powers
(above all, America and Russia) reduce their stockpiles and move

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024088.txt,"stock annually on a “mark-to-market” basis so that the Fund may treat any resulting gain or
loss as ordinary income or loss to avoid the PFIC tax.

As noted above, the PFIC rules (including the rules pertaining to QEF elections) generally
should not affect tax-exempt U.S. Partners.

The Fund cannot predict with any certainty at this time whether any non-U.S. portfolio
company in which the Fund invests may be subject to the PFIC regime, whether a timely QEF
election can or will be made, or the effect or availability of any applicable elections made by the
Fund. The rules applicable to PFICs are complex, and the foregoing summary of U.S. federal
income taxation of U.S. Partners indirectly owning an interest in a PFIC is general in nature. It
is possible that U.S. Partners may be subject to tax currently under the PFIC regime on their
proportionate shares of certain earnings of a non-U.S. corporation in which the Fund holds an
interest and/or may incur nondeductible interest-like charges on tax liability deferred under the
PFIC regime without receiving from the Fund distributions sufficient to satisfy any such
obligations.

In addition to the PFIC rules discussed above, a U.S. person that is a shareholder of a PFIC may
be required to file an annual information report and/or applicable tax forms with the IRS.

Controlled Foreign Corporations - Under Sections 951 through 957 of the Code, special rules
apply to U.S. persons who own, directly or indirectly and applying certain attribution rules,
10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of a non-U.S. corporation
(each, a “United States Shareholder”) that is a “controlled foreign corporation” (“CFC”). For
this purpose, the Fund will be treated as a United States Shareholder of any foreign corporation
in which the Fund’s share ownership reaches this 10% threshold. A non-U.S. corporation
generally will be a CFC for a taxable year if United States Shareholders collectively own more
than 50% of the total combined voting power or total value of the corporation’s stock on any
day during such taxable year. United States Shareholders of a CFC generally must include in
their gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes their pro rata shares of certain earnings
and profits of the CFC. Further, under Section 1248 of the Code, if a U.S. person sells or
exchanges stock of a non-U.S. corporation and that person is or was a United States Shareholder
at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of such sale or exchange during
which that non-U.S. corporation was a CFC, that U.S. person generally will be required to treat
a portion of the gain recognized upon such sale or exchange as a dividend to the extent of the
earnings and profits of the CFC attributable to such stock. Under U.S. federal income tax rules,
the Fund itself is a U.S. person and, if the Fund becomes a United States Shareholder of a CFC,
taxable U.S. Partners (i) will be required to report and pay tax currently on their shares of the
CFC’s earnings and profits attributable to the Fund that are taxable to its United States
Shareholders under the CFC rules, and (ii) will be subject to the Section 1248 recharacterization
rule described above. In addition, if the Fund is a United States Shareholder of a CFC and a
U.S. Partner disposes of its Limited Partner Interest, that Partner generally will recognize
income under Section 751 of the Code equal to its distributive share of the Section 1248 income
that would have been triggered if the Fund had sold its interest in the CFC at fair market value.
The maximum rate of tax imposed on certain dividend income and certain long-term capital
gains attributable to dispositions of securities generally is 20%, so that a recharacterization of
gain under Section 1248 might not increase that U.S. Partner’s U.S. federal income tax liability.
In addition, income of a CFC subject to income tax in a country other than the U.S. at an

New and noteworthy is a term that gets tossed around a lot in the travel world, but we're taking it seriously to heart this week at Jetsetter. The new is the Dream Downtown NYC, a hip, reinvented space at the crossroads of Chelsea and the Meatpacking District (MePa, if you really must). The noteworthy is a little thing called skydiving at Mount Everest. Whether it's lounging poolside in New York or jumping out of a plane in full view of the world's highest mountain, there's a lot going on this week. Read on for all the details, including properties in Paris, San Francisco, Vegas, Miami and more. (Image: Skydive Mount Everest - on sale Sat, Aug 6.)

	The new Dream Downtown has the best of both worlds. Housed in a 1960s building designed by Albert C. Ledner, it's situated at the crux of Manhattan's art, design and nightlife scenes between Chelsea and the Meatpacking District. With a hot rooftop bar, a Miami-meets-Ibiza pool (with lounge chairs set in real sand) and modern rooms with classic Downtown views, you can have your party and a good night's sleep, too.

	Just a short walk from the Arc de Triomphe, Mon Hotel sits on a quiet street off the bustling boulevards. Designer Aurélia Santoni fashioned this intimate boutique property with eccentricity and flair; lampshades from Dutch design firm Moooi hang above Utrecht armchairs in the lobby. Above all, the style of the guestrooms and the service stress comfort; Mon feels like your personal Paris pied-à-terre.

	Just outside Heraklion, Crete's capital city, the Candia Maris is a sprawling beachside resort spanning nearly 10 acres. Although the property lacks the charm of smaller hotels, it more than compensates with its amenities, which include tennis courts and seven pools. The highlight is the vast thalassotherapy spa, which underwent a multimillion-dollar renovation in 2008.

	In the mountainous north of the country, just over an hour from Porto, the recently opened Vidago Palace has, in one fell swoop, raised the bar for luxury getaways in Portugal. As far removed from the sun and sand of the touristy Algarve as you can get, this is a destination for the discerning traveler and the lover of fine things, whether they be cigars, hand-painted silk wallpaper, the country's best spa or a championship golf course.

	Leisure and business travelers feel like locals at this historic boutique hotel set among the embassies and grand residences of Budapest's tree-lined Andrassy Avenue. Built in 1937 and completely renovated three years ago, the hotel is home to a hip-again Bauhaus style in the comfortable rooms and gourmet dining at on-site Baraka Restaurant. For exploring, you can't beat the location: It's a short walk to restaurants, parks, museums and the city's famed thermal baths.

	The Cervo may have a Swiss address, but there's nothing neutral about this boutique hotel's atmosphere and hospitality. In Zermatt, a legendary ski village where the Matterhorn (Horu to locals) dominates the landscape (and the activities, yearround) the hotel has the requisite majestic views. But modern interiors and quirky accents like antlers and cheerful checkerboard patterns make the Cervo a study in Swiss chic.

	In a beautifully renovated redbrick-and-stone former bank building, the Omni San Francisco has an elegant ambiance and draws inspiration from Renaissance Florence. The spacious rooms have carved-mahogany furniture and nine-foot-high crown molded ceilings, while sparkling crystal chandeliers, mahogany paneling and an iron-and-marble staircase define the lobby. Best of all, it's within walking distance from some of the city's top attractions like Union Square, North Beach and Chinatown.

	These hilltop retreats are some of Phuket's most romantic crash pads thanks to sublime panoramic Andaman Sea views and the island's most discreet staff. All villas include swimmable pools and roomy decks for sun and shade. The 360 bar attracts the island's best dressed inhabitants who flock here at sundown for the calm view then stay sipping colorful cocktails late into the warm night.

	Looking more like some millionaire's Miami crib than a traditional Cancún resort, the all white, Zen-minimalist La Amada Hotel exudes a down-to-earth sexiness and an understated elegance - all creamy sofas, gauzy curtains and personal Jacuzzis. Just 20 minutes north of central Cancún in Playa Mujeres, La Amada is on a long, pristine and very secluded beach.

	Named for James Madison, the fourth president and father of the Constitution, this stately hotel has traditional style and refined service - plus, a location that puts many of Washington's must-see museums and monuments along the Mall within walking distance. Opened in 1963, the 353-room hotel has hosted the Dalai Lama, the occasional celebrity and every U.S. president since John F. Kennedy except Barack Obama. But don't worry - you can stop by the White House, which is just five blocks away.

	The Raleigh is different from most properties in South Beach, with a vibe that's more Deco cool than decked out to the nines. A stay here feels a bit like a trip to the 1940s - dressed in whites one minute, casual the next. It's all about lounging in style by the pool, which has hosted everything from Esther Williams swimming routines to Chanel's cruise collection show. The Raleigh itself is a lot like that pool: cool, pretty and a place to be seen.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017822.txt,"Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-16 Filed 04/16/19 Page 5 of6

Dershowitz, in interviews with the Herald, and in recent public statements, said he has never
met Ransome. He also said she initially tried to interest the New York Post in her story, but a
reporter whom he said he spoke with told him Ransome was not credible. He said he has a trove
of emails between Ransome and the reporter that prove she is a “lunatic.”

“There are hundreds of emails in which she claimed to have sex with everybody in the world and
also claimed she has video of Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and others having sex
with underage girls — but she never ever accused me in these emails,” Dershowitz said.

The emails are under seal, he said, and therefore cannot be made public. Dershowitz said he has
asked the court to unseal them but his efforts thus far have been unsuccessful.

In the recent court transcript, however, it is Maxwell’s attorney, Laura Menninger — not
Ransome or her attorneys — who named Dershowitz.

“[Ransome] has alleged not only that my client [Maxwell] ran a sex trafficking organization but
she claims also that she was directed by my client and the Epstein defendants to have sex with
third parties, including Alan Dershowitz, for example,” Menninger said. “And so to the extent
my client or Mr. Dershowitz or anyone else is going to be asked about their private sexual
activity, I believe that would implicate their privacy rights...”

Roberts, who now lives in Australia, said that Epstein ordered her to have sex with Dershowitz
six times, according to a 2015 affidavit, which was filed in connection with an unrelated Epstein
federal lawsuit.

At that time, Dershowitz launched a media blitz on TV asserting that Roberts made up the story.
He also called for Roberts’ lawyers — Edwards and University of Utah law professor Paul Cassell
— to be disbarred. The lawyers sued Dershowitz for defamation, and the case was settled last
year.

Dershowitz publicly declared he was vindicated after a federal judge ordered Roberts’ affidavit
stricken from the court record. But the judge did not address the veracity of her sexual
misconduct claims; he instead ruled that the affidavit was misplaced in a case not involving
Dershowitz.

Boies, whose firm represented Roberts pro bono, addressed Dershowitz’s longstanding
contention that he had been exonerated.

“Anytime in a lawsuit where you were the defendant and you paid the plaintiff $900,000 to
settle it — that’s a strange kind of vindication,” Boies said, asserting that Dershowitz paid that
amount as part of the defamation settlement with Edwards and Cassell.

In 2016, Dershowitz released a statement following what he said was “an independent
investigation” that had been conducted by former FBI Director Louis Freeh, who is now a
private consultant.

“Our investigation found no evidence to support the accusations of sexual misconduct against
Professor Dershowitz. In fact, in several instances, the evidence directly contradicted the
accusations made against him,” Freeh wrote.

Most of the court records in the Roberts case are sealed. In February, the Miami Herald filed a
motion in the Southern District of New York, seeking access to documents. The motion, which

was not opposed by Roberts, could shed more light on the full scope of Epstein’s crimes and
who was involved.

fF confided to him that she had never even had a boyfriend. He told her
everything would fall into place, “just keep doing what you are doing, work hard and stay
focused.” She told Mr. Epstein that she preferred to abstain from sex until she was married.

The first time HE asked her for a massage was to help with an ache in his
shoulder. I thought it was an innocent request. He said his masseuse had failed to
get a kink out of his shoulder. He gave her a large purple massager for her to use to take the knot
out of his back. Mr. Epstein told her she was an excellent masseuse and she was pleased to be
able to ease his pain.

When the massage ended, Mr. Epstein pulled two hundred dollars from his wallet and
handed it to her. He said, “I was going to give it to the masseuse anyway, so you take it and pay
for your car service or something.”

Mr. Epstein began calling her every day, no matter where she was in the world. He told
her he loved her. He became a vital part of a as her parents remained
distant. He invited her to stay at one of his apartments close to him on the Upper East Side. Her
arduous work schedule, starting with 6:00 a.m. call times and shows running late into the night
were exhausting. Epstein’s daily check-up calls and pep talks gave her strength to survive her
grinding schedule.

When in Paris, Mr. Epstein allowed her to stay at his home with her sister and arranged
for a night out at a concert with Naomi Campbell. It appeared to a ih: Mr. Epstein’s
thoughts were focused on her career, future and good fortune.

The first time the purple massage tool found its way between her legs, a 01d
him to stop, but Mr. Epstein pushed the head of the massager firmly against her and forced her
legs apart. She felt ashamed and embarrassed. The massages became a ritual and were always
accompanied with sexual abuse and a two-hundred dollar payment at the end.

Mr. Epstein approached her as if he was her mentor and teacher, teaching her about
sexuality, opening her eyes. She experienced immense orgasms, and then shame and fear. She
felt claustrophobia as she stared up into Mr. Epstein’s church-like ceiling of the massage parlor
while he fondled her. She felt she couldn’t escape her position, and that this was the way it had
to be because this powerful man orchestrated it. At the end of each massage he would make
himself ejaculate by demanding she pay vigorous attention to his nipples with her fingers and he
would tell her what a good girl she was, that he loved her and would call her later, which made
everything seem better. Then he would open his wallet filled with hundred dollar bills and give
her a couple, which she accepted as pocket money, never thinking twice about it.

But if Washington remains committed to
ever-tougher sanctions — and without
promising Iran that sanctions will be
lifted as part of a deal — then negotiations
are unlikely to succeed. Vali Nasr,
another former Obama administration
official with expertise on Iran, suggested
recently that there's not much more the
world can do to sanction Iran, and that
such penalties could drive Tehran to take
radical action. The regime of sanctions
against Iran over its nuclear activity
really has reached its end, Nasr, dean of
the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced
International Studies at Johns Hopkins
University, said during the World
Economic Forum in Davos. And he
warned that unless there is a diplomatic
breakthrough — or, alternatively, an
attack on Iran — you really are looking
at a scenario where Iran is going to rush
very quickly towards nuclear power,
because they also think, like North
Korea, that (then) you have much more
leverage to get rid of these sanctions.”

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029735
"
IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030264.txt,"impeachment is an unconstitutional trampling on the separation of
powers.

As the President, by nature and design, tries to claim aggressive new
powers, the Mueller team, almost in equal proportion, is trying to limit
the theory of Presidential power and, even, to criminalize an expansive
exercise of those powers.

People who know and have worked with Mueller find it, at best,
unexpected that this traditional by the book G-man would be pursuing
such far-reaching legal theories. But one possible explanation, shared by
many in the White House, is that Mueller is overly reliant on his staff—
in face, is being led by his number two, Andrew Weissmann.

Weismann has a longstanding reputation for aggression: he was
the prosecutor whose pursuit of the accounting firm Arthur Anderson in
the Enron debacle ended in its conviction—a judgment reversed well
after the firm's bankruptcy and dissolution. One White House advisor
likened him to Victor Hugo's obsessed policeman Inspector Javert—a
prosecutor consumed with taking down the President. Indeed,
Weissmann, who has in the past contributed to Democratic candidates,
is a particular bet noir and favorite whipping boy for the White House
his central role in the Mueller investigation taken there as evidence of a
deep bias against Donald Trump.

But in another view it is precisely because Mueller, a former
Marine, is so by the book and Semper Fi that he finds Trump's behavior
to be personally offensive, and, on its face, corrupt. Bob Mueller is all
about limits and rules. Donald Trump has none and acknowledges
none, said one lawyer who has worked with Mueller in the past.

It may yet be even a more profound clash then that, the executive
branch at war with itself—the Justice Department against the White
House. In this, the President's almost daily tirades against the DOJ, the
Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, the Deputy Attorney General,
Rosenstein, the former head of the FBI, Comey, and his deputy, Andrew
McCabe, are part of an effort to obstruct justice and save himself.

The Mueller strategy (or Weissmann strategy) is a war strategy, in
the view of some legal observers. An indictment of the President would

cleaned up you are for the conference.

[Laughter]

Questioner: Hello, my name is Deborah Lubov. I’m a Vatican correspondent for Zenit
news agency, for their English edition. I have some experience working in New York — I
was working for PricewaterhouseCoopers auditing investment banks, one of which was
Goldman Sachs. And considering this conference is on poverty, I’m curious — from your
point of view especially, your experience in the investment banking world — what
concrete measures do you think they should be doing to combat, prevent this
phenomenon? We know that various sums of money are used in all sorts of ways and they
do have different initiatives, but in order to concretely counter this epidemic now, what

are your thoughts?

“For Christians, and particularly for those who believe in the underpinnings of the
Judeo-Christian West, I don’t believe that we should have a [financial] bailout.”

Bannon: That’s a great question. The 2008 crisis, I think the financial crisis — which, by
the way, I don’t think we’ve come through — is really driven I believe by the greed, much
of it driven by the greed of the investment banks. My old firm, Goldman Sachs —
traditionally the best banks are leveraged 8:1. When we had the financial crisis in 2008,
the investment banks were leveraged 35:1. Those rules had specifically been changed by a
guy named Hank Paulson. He was secretary of Treasury. As chairman of Goldman Sachs,
he had gone to Washington years before and asked for those changes. That made the
banks not really investment banks, but made them hedge funds — and highly susceptible
to changes in liquidity. And so the crisis of 2008 was, quite frankly, really never recovered
from in the United States. It’s one of the reasons last quarter you saw 2.9% negative
growth in a quarter. So the United States economy is in very, very tough shape.

And one of the reasons is that we’ve never really gone and dug down and sorted through
the problems of 2008. Particularly the fact — think about it — not one criminal charge has
ever been brought to any bank executive associated with 2008 crisis. And in fact, it gets

worse. No bonuses and none of their equity was taken. So part of the prime drivers of the

who acted unfairly to them — personal revenge — or punish someone who acted unfairly to someone
else — impersonal punishment. For each subject, Strobel also collected information on a gene called
COMT Met. This gene has three different forms, linked to differences in activity level in the frontal lobe
of the brain, which are linked to differences in the levels of dopamine, which are linked to differences in
the experience of reward. Given the different forms of COMT Met, at least part of what we experience as
the feeling of reward or gratification was determined by our parents, and our parent’s parents, and their
parent’s parents, all the way back to our ape-like cousins who evolved this gene.

When Strobel looked at the brain scans of his subjects, he found that the same circuitry was
engaged for personal revenge and impersonal punishment, with significant activity in the striatum — a
reward area — as well as in the insula — an area involved in the feeling of disgust. When we detect an
injustice, we feel disgusted, a feeling that may motivate our desire for retribution. The striatum finishes
off the process, rewarding us for our punitive response, and wiping out the negative feeling of disgust.
Importantly, individuals with the high expressing form of COMT Met, and thus, higher levels of
dopamine, showed stronger activation in the striatum, and were more likely to punish those who act
unfairly. Strobel suggests that those with the high expressing form punished more because they
anticipated a higher level of reward. If this explanation is right, it has profound consequences for how we
think about individual participation in the policing of norms and the honey hits associated with
aggression. Some people will have a natural bias to shy away from punishment, not because they fail to
see the importance of ratting out cheaters, but because they don’t anticipate feeling good about it. Others
will be prone to punish even the most minor infractions because they feel empowered and good about it.
Those who are empowered to punish because it feels good have forged a stronger association between
aggression and reward. Unbeknownst to these individuals, they started life with a bias, one that colored
their willingness to harm others. This bias is joined by many others that I discuss in the next few sections.

The take home message is that if you are born male, endowed with certain genetic variants such
as the low activity form of MAOA, and experience physical and psychological abuse by your parents, the
odds of delinquency are frighteningly high. That’s the bad news. The good news is that if you are born
male, have the high activity variant of the MAOA gene, and experience physical and psychological abuse
by your parents, you are vaccinated by nature against the harms of your unfortunate nurture. The
problem, of course, is that you have no say over which endowment you get, nor over the kinds of parents
you receive.

One of the reasons I have worked through this case study of genetic constraints and
environmental sculpting is to provide an antidote to the often polarized views that have dominated much

of the historical and psychological literature on evil. Many of the earliest, and most famous psychological

Interviewer: It's the Icarus story—someone who flies 
too close to the sun. 
Jeffrey Epstein: Did Icarus like massages? 
—New York City, 2007 
AUTHOR'S NOTE 
Late one afternoon, while taking a leisurely stroll on the Upper 
East Side of Manhattan, Tim Malloy, a friend of mine and a col-
laborator on this book, nearly ran into a trim, silver-haired 
neighbor of ours from Palm Beach. 
The man was walking down Madison Avenue, and several 
things about him were striking. For one thing, he was wearing 
slippers. Expensive, embroidered, monogrammed slippers. But 
slippers all the same. 
For another, he was accompanied by two attractive women. 
Even in Manhattan, an island that attracts beautiful women from 
all over the world, these women stood out. 
As the man half shuffled, half walked down the avenue, the 
women walked slightly behind him, as if they were attendants or 
staff. 
Tim followed, keeping a respectable distance, as the three-
some made a right onto 71st Street and headed toward an enor-
mous town house— a house that was almost a fortress—right 
vii 
AUTHOR'S NOTE 
in the middle of the block. The imposing residence had a stone 
facade and a fifteen-foot-high front door that wouldn't have 
looked out of place protecting a castle. And, like our neighbor's 
slippers, the house had a monogram: raised brass letters that 
spelled out JE. 
The house and, quite possibly, the two women belonged to 
Jeffrey Epstein, a rich and powerful man who was also a regis-
tered sex offender with a strong taste for underage women. 
Not just sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds. But younger girls 
as well. 
Epstein was alleged to have abused dozens of young women, 
or, more accurately, girls. He'd settled potential lawsuits with 
some of them. He'd done a bit of prison time for his crimes. A bit 
of time. And now here he was, out in the world again. 
Accompanied by two beautiful young women. 
I had been hearing hair-raising stories about Jeffrey Epstein for a 
couple of years. Our interests could not have been more differ-
ent, but Palm Beach, where we both live, is small and tightly 
knit, and we knew some of the same people. 
Epstein's arrest had made headlines in papers all over the 
world. But in Palm Beach, it caused a scandal that continues to 
set off aftershocks and leave a bad smell. 
So I had followed Epstein's case in the media and talked 
about it over dinners with friends. I wondered why it had taken 
so long for the Palm Beach police to catch up with Epstein. And, 
once they did, why he had served so little jail time. 
Those were the obvious questions, but there were others:

seemed to know. And while the news media had some details 
about the underage girls, reporters seemed only to know what 
had happened at the moment of his arrest. 
Epstein definitely liked his massages. He got them from two, 
even three, young women a day, right in his mansion on the 
island. He'd been operating on an almost industrial scale. But 
who were these girls? Where had they come from? How did they 
find their way to his home on a secluded street in Palm Beach? 
Epstein had powerful friends. He'd flown Bill Clinton around 
in his private jet and rubbed shoulders with heads of state, Nobel 
Prize winners, any number of billionaires. Prince Andrew, the 
man sixth in line to the British throne, had been a close friend. 
Were any of these connections the reason that Epstein was 
now a free man? 
I wanted to know. After all, our homes were a half mile apart, 
and Epstein's actions had had an undeniable impact on the town 
where I lived. Stirred by that sighting of Epstein up in New York, 
Tim Malloy and I began to investigate. 
We partnered with John Connolly, a tough, no-nonsense 
journalist who had once been a cop with the NYPD and had been 
following the Epstein story for close to ten years. 
Working together, we interviewed Epstein's friends, going all 
the way back to his childhood; we met with Epstein's acquain-
tances, employees, neighbors, and business associates, and finally 
with the families of his victims. We interviewed law enforce-
ment officers who'd worked on the investigation in Palm Beach 
and lawyers on all sides of the resulting court cases, some of 
which are still working their way through the court system. 
Combining our interview material with evidence obtained 
from court filings and other investigations, such as the one 
ix 
AUTHOR'S NOTE 
conducted by Connolly's Vanity Fair colleague Vicky Ward, we 
began to put the pieces together. 
In a few instances, we have re-created brief scenes and 
snatches of dialogue. These are based on interviews, police 
investigation documents, and court filings. We changed the 
names and identities of the girls, hoping to protect them from 
more embarrassment and harm. 
There never was any doubt that Jeffrey Epstein was guilty. He 
admitted as much in the non-prosecution agreement he agreed 
to sign in 2007. The question is, what exactly was he guilty of? 
This book attempts to answer that question and many others 
about this strange and mysterious man. These days people all 
around the world are angry about and suspicious of the super 
rich and powerful. The story of Jeffrey Epstein is an object lesson 
about why we ought to be. To put it simply, some people think 
they can operate outside the law. And that's what they do.

PART I 
The Crime 
CHAPTER I 
Mary: February 2005 
/t's a typically slow South Florida Sunday, and Mary's staring 
into the mirror, trying to wipe the morning cobwebs away 
from her dark, sleepy eyes. 
She's a pretty girl, tiny—just five feet three inches tall—but 
tanned and athletic, with curly black henna-streaked hair.* Her 
bedroom's a playland of pinks and pastels, stuffed animals, and 
boy-band posters. But Mary's a teenager now. Fourteen years old. 
She even has a boyfriend. He's cute and popular. Joe' is the heart-
throb of her school, and Mary's feelings for him are new to her, 
powerful, hard to untangle. She's thinking of Joe as she presses 
the Play button on her iPod. 
The MP3 player's on shuffle. There's no telling what song will

come up, and Mary's head drops dramatically in anticipation. 
Then a loud, sexy throb spills out of the earbuds: Britney Spears. 
The bass line takes over, and she starts to dance, moving her 
hips as she lip-synchs the lyrics: 
With a taste of a poison paradise . . . 
Mary's swept away by the song. She's twirling around and 
around, flinging her arms out to grab the clothes hanging up in 
her closet—it's like embracing ten thousand fans! Then she stops 
and pulls out the earbuds. Suddenly she's become fourteen again. 
Just a girl, jittery, nervous. 
What she's thinking about now is what she will wear to the 
big fancy house. 
Mary desperately wants to make an impression. This will be her 
first trip to the house. She does not want to look like a child on 
this outing. 
She picks out a pair of skinny white jeans, puts on a freshly 
washed halter top that leaves her flat stomach bare. The cross 
that Joe gave her last Christmas hangs from her neck. 
Think of the money, she thinks. 
For Mary, it's incredible money. Several weeks' wages at 
Mickey D's. And just for giving some old man a massage? She 
twists the earbuds back in, dives into the closet, sings along with 
Britney Spears: 
Don't you know that you're toxic? 
The tight white jeans fit Mary perfectly. She turns to check 
herself out in the mirror, cropping the scene with her fingers to

in big, high-ceilinged bedrooms have American Girl dolls. Dolls 
with natural smiles, perfectly vacant moon faces. American Girl 
dolls are beautiful. They're expensive. But you have to have one 
if Mom and Dad are willing to pay. Over on the Coast, most 
mothers and fathers are. But out in the sticks, where Mary lives, 
you get Barbies —passed down from mother to daughter, from 
sister to sister. They're rail-thin, missile-breasted. There's a touch 
of knowingness to the curl of their otherwise innocent mouths. 
American Girl dolls are girlie, but Barbie's like Britney Spears. 
Barbie's dangling her long legs over the line that separates girls 
from women. 
Be like Barbie, Mary thinks. 
She can't be nervous. Not now. Not today. 
What she tells herself, over and over again, is: It's not that big 
a deal. 
But, of course, it is a big deal. Before long, Mary's visit to the 
big fancy house will become part of a months-long Palm Beach 
police investigation—an affidavit for probable cause, filed by 
the Palm Beach PD — and, finally, the arrest and conviction of 
the home's owner, Jeffrey Epstein.

CHAPTER 2 
Jeffrey Epstein: February 2005 
Jeffrey's morning routine is precise and unvarying. First he 
spends twenty-five minutes in silence, visualizing the day 
ahead as he digests the guava, banana, and Mileslix that his 
chef prepares for him— the same way every day—at six in the 
morning. Then Jeffrey walks a third of a mile up to South County 
Road, pausing once in a while to take deep, restorative breaths. 
It's a slight slope that leads toward the ocean. Jeffrey's home 
on the Intracoastal Waterway is behind him now. The morning's 
not windy. The Atlantic is calm and glittery, and fishing trawlers 
bob gently on distant waves. 
Jeffrey's partial to monogrammed sweatpants, monogrammed 
fleece pullovers, and hoodies. Casual attire offset by embroi-
dered Stubbs & Wootton slippers— the kind that sell for hun-
dreds of dollars a pair. His hair, which is thick, has turned silver.

paunch. For a fifty-two-year-old 
man, he's extremely fit. Six feet tall, 180 pounds, brown eyes, a 
strong jawline. 
He's never been a drinker. He doesn't smoke or take drugs, 
and he takes care good care of his body as well as his mind. 
It's a magnificent mind. His gift is for numbers: complex calcu-
lations, abstract formulas. Even as a child, Jeffrey could untangle 
math problems that would stump most smart adults. Numbers just 
fall into place for him, forming in ranks he can bend, twist, 
manipulate—and multiply. He could have been a scientist or a 
mathematician. As a young man, he taught calculus and physics. 
Then he became an investor—a very rich man. Then he became a 
philanthropist, like Bill Gates. His love for science has inspired him 
to give millions to academics and institutions committed to study-
ing mysteries of the brain and the arcana of physics. He's given mil-
lions to Harvard. And he's given money to politicians: Governor 
Eliot Spitzer, of New York, and Governor Bill Richardson, of New 
Mexico, where Epstein owns the largest home in the state. 
Epstein's flown Bill Clinton to Africa on a private jet—not 
the Gulfstream he owns but his Boeing 727, customized with its 
own trading floor —so that the former president could promote 
his various and worthy causes. 
Just for fun, Chris Tucker, the comedian, and Clinton's pal 
Kevin Spacey had tagged along for the ride. 
Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed 
philanthropist with a keen sense of global markets and an 
in-depth knowledge of twenty-first-century science, Clinton 
would say through a spokesperson. I especially appreciated his 
insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work 
on democratization, empowering the poor, citizen service, and 
combating HIV/AIDS.

But is Jeffrey thinking about that trip now? 
His first guest is due that morning at nine, and that leaves 
him enough time for a shower, a lunch, and a few phone calls 
before the second girl arrives. 
Sarah has scheduled that girl for one. 
For Jeffrey, it's just part of the daily routine. 
But on this day, there's a delicious twist. 
One of the girls is a first-timer.

She's here. Your friend with the truck. 
Mary runs down the stairs. It's game day, and Dad's already 
got the TV on. Her stepmom's out running errands. Mary's twin 
sister has gone out, too, Rollerblading with a few of her friends. 
Going *shopping, she yells, and she pops a piece of Dubble 
Bubble into her mouth.

Mary's already halfway out the door. Her father calls out 
again, but on Sundays there's no getting him out of his chair. 
Besides, Mary knows he'll be happy when he sees the money

JAMES PATTERSON 
making.* And it's not like she's running off to do something 
crazy. After all, Wendy's assured her already that there's nothing 
to worry about. 
Mary's father is Cuban—an immigrant—a self-made man who 
runs a contracting business. He's wise to the ways of the world 
and highly protective of his two daughters. They're good girls, he 
knows. Almost angels. As far as he knows, they don't drink. 
They've never tried drugs. They love clothes and, especially, 
music —Britney Spears, Nelly Furtado, Maroon 5, the boy band 
with that dreamy lead singer. Mary loves California, which she's 
never seen but daydreams about. She just knows she'll live there 
someday—a plan that's okay with her father as long as Mary 
keeps up with her homework and chores. 
What he worries about, in the meantime, is the crowd that 
Mary runs with. 
Joe is a fine boy. More responsible than most American boys 
his age. But Joe's cousin, Wendy, is another story. Mary's father 
doesn't like Wendy at all and would have liked her even less had 
he known about Wendy's intentions. 
In just one hour, Wendy's told Mary, she can make more 
money than her father makes in a day: This guy in Palm Beach. 
He's rich. Very rich. He has an airplane. He owns an island, you 
know? 
Like a lot of kids who live inland, away from the Florida 
coast, Mary's dreams reach way beyond the dull, scrubby flat-

lands and strip malls she's grown up around. There's so much 
that she wants to do and see. But for her the Gold Coast, twenty 
miles away, might as well be another country. 
Yes, she had said, without even thinking about it. 
Then there was Joe to contend with. 
Who is this guy? Joe had said, shaking his head. You don't 
know a thing about him. 
Hundreds of dollars, Mary had whispered. She couldn't 
quite look at Joe, but she was firm: I can make that in one hour 
Joe seemed to think they were actually talking about it. A 
conversation—some back-and-forth. But the thought of not going 
hadn't even crossed Mary's mind. If anything, she hoped that it 
would become a regular thing. 
To rub his feet? Are you kidding? If you're not worried about 
it, why haven't you told your dad? 
It's your cousin, Joe! Some girls go three times a week. 
The guy's feet must be killing him. 
Shut up! 
Tell your father. 
You know how Dad is. You don't tell your parents 
everything. 
I'm not going to some freak's mansion to rub his feet. 
That's right. I am. 
And if I told your father? Or mine? 
You'd never see me again. 
Mary felt bad as she said it. She felt bad for lying. 
She knew that it would be more than a foot rub. 
Wendy had told her that much, at least.

CHAPTER 4 
Jeffrey Epstein: February 2005 
John Kluge, the media magnate, has bought up several lots 
around here, torn down the mansions, and built a grand, 
sprawling estate. But Epstein's neighbors have blocked his 
own efforts to buy more land and increase his holdings. 
Epstein's address in Palm Beach is 358 El Brillo Way. Built in 
the fifties by a totally run-of-the-mill architect, the house has 
none of the elegance of his neighbors' homes. It's big, with a big 
swimming pool—that's the most you can say for it. It's totally 
bland. But it's the last house on a dead-end block, the last block 
of the street, and this makes it very secluded. 
Tonight, one of Epstein's black Escalades will whisk him 
away, taking him to the private terminal at Palm Beach Interna-
tional Airport. Then a short flight down to Little Saint James — 
or, as he likes to call it, Little Saint Jeff's—the seventy-eight-acre

are still things to attend to in Florida. Business and pleasure — 
although, in Epstein's experience, the two have always fit together 
nicely. 
He strolls through the gate, past the guard, up to the side 
door that leads to the kitchen. Inside, he ignores the maid doing 
dishes and climbs a wide, winding staircase to the second floor. 
He walks down a hallway, one that's lined with photographs of 
naked women. Then, in his bedroom, he opens a closet. Inside, 
there are many more photographs. Erotic photos, tacked to the 
wall, of girls who have come to the house. 
Familiar faces, familiar bodies. That's what makes the 
first-timers so special. 
Epstein checks his watch before closing the door. 
The Virgin Islands can wait.

CHAPTER 5 
Mary: February 2005 
The Dubble Bubble's lost all its flavor, but Mary's still chew-
ing the gum as she shifts, nervously, in the backseat of 
Wendy's big pickup truck. The girl sitting up front next 
to Wendy is a stranger to Mary. She's chain-smoking menthols. 
The music is blaring; the seat is filthy and gross. Worried that 
her white jeans will get grody, Mary sits on her hands. Then, 
through the window, she sees a gigantic resort called the Break-
ers. It is resplendent, sun-drenched, not quite real—like some-
thing you'd see in the movies. 
It makes for an interesting contrast. 
We'll wait for her, Wendy says to the girl in the passenger 
seat. Then we can all go to the mall. 
Which one? 
The Gardens. 
It's like she's not there. Mary wants to say something about it,

wants to say something about it, 
14 
but she doesn't know if the other girls would even respond. Wen-
dy's always seemed so much cooler than kids Mary's age. This 
other girl's just a mystery. And when Wendy does turn around to 
speak to Mary, her stare seems to slice right through the younger 
girl. 
Remember, Wendy says, according to a probable cause affi-
davit filed by the Palm Beach police. When he asks how old you 
are, say eighteen. 
The light changes, and Wendy turns back around but keeps 
looking at Mary in the rearview mirror. 
Got it? 
Mary nods. 
I mean it, says Wendy. 
Who would believe her? Anyone can see that Mary is younger 
than that. 
Okay, she says. I got it. Eighteen. 
Mary takes out her flip phone and sends Joe a text: Your 
cousin is a BAMF. 
A badass motherfucker. 
There's no reply. 
Or maybe she's just a bitch, Mary texts. 
Still no reply. 
Joe must still be in church, Mary thinks. 
They pass El Bravo Way and turn onto El Brillo Way. 
Wendy's driving slowly now, right at the speed limit. Once 
more, she says: When the man asks your age, say eighteen. 
Mary nods again and smiles, slightly. She wants Wendy to 
see her smiling. To know that she's got it all under control. But 
Wendy's eyes are on the front gate now. It opens, she parks, and 
they walk past a guard. 
15 
JAMES PATTERSON 
We're here to see Jeff, says Wendy. 
The guard nods—of course you are—and leads them to the 
side door. 
They're in the kitchen now. Mary, Wendy, some middle-aged 
man. The man has a long face, bushy eyebrows, and thick silver 
hair—and he's fit. As fit as the jocks that Mary goes to school 
with. Not attractive, exactly. He's way too old for that. But confi-
dent, in a way that makes an impression. 
Standing behind the man there's a woman. She's blond, very 
pretty, much taller than Wendy. 
What a strange scene, Mary thinks. She can't shake the feeling 
that the man is studying her. Then he nods, and he and Wendy 
walk out of the kitchen. A little while later, they're back. 
Sarah, the man says to the tall woman. You can take Mary 
upstairs. 
Sarah takes Mary up a wide winding staircase carpeted in pink. 
Together they walk down a hall that's got photographs on the 
wall—naked women. Long curtains cover windows and don't 
let in much light. In the air, there's a strong lavender fragrance. 
Then they come to a room containing a green-and-pink sofa. 
There's a large bathroom off to one side and doors on either side 
of the sofa. There's a wooden armoire with sex toys on it. There's 
a massage table, too, and a mural of a naked woman. 
Wait here, says Sarah. Jeff will be up in a moment. 
Mary's too freaked out to do anything else. Fidgeting with 
her belt loops, she sits on the sofa, jumps up again.

Then she sees the picture. 
All the girls in the photos are young. But the girl in this one's 
just a baby. 
Much younger than Mary herself. 
The girl's smiling, but the smile's mixed with something 
else—some sort of anxiety that's out of place on such a small 
face. And what she's doing is shocking: pulling her underwear 
off to the side. Flashing one of her tiny apple-round butt cheeks 
toward the camera. 
Mary gasps. She turns around. And there's Epstein standing 
in front of her, wearing nothing but a towel.

CHAPTER 6 
Michael Reiter: March 2005 
Chief Reiter looks more like a bank president than a cop. 
He's well built, with an air of formality and discretion. But 
he's got twenty-four years on the job. Decades earlier, he 
was a campus police officer in Pittsburgh. Then he rose, steadily, 
through the ranks in Palm Beach, moving up from patrol officer 
to detective, working vice, narcotics, and organized crime, then 
becoming a sergeant, captain, major, and assistant chief—a job 
he held for three years—before becoming chief of police. Reiter 
is what you'd call seasoned, although chief of police in Palm 
Beach is a job that calls upon his political skills as much as his 
street smarts. 
Then again, from time to time, things do happen. 
Once in a blue moon there are murders— though these are 
so rare that they tend to be remembered for decades. 
Sometimes there are hurricanes to contend with, and, when the

sea calms, human cargo washes up on the shore. Sometimes traf-
fickers aim the bows of their boats at the glow of the Breakers resort, 
order their passengers to go overboard, then tell them to swim. 
Most of the passengers are Haitian—men, women, and children 
who stake all they have on a chance at a life in America. From time 
to time, Palm Beach cops have to retrieve their bodies from the surf. 
Things get busier during the wintertime, or, as the locals call 
it, the season. It's when the very rich come to town, throw par-
ties and balls, shop, and tangle traffic at the intersections around 
Worth Avenue. The population booms, and the men and women 
who work under Chief Reiter deal with fender benders, shoplift-
ers, and snotty skateboarding teenagers. There are DUIs. Domes-
tic disturbances. Choking victims and heart attacks. It's routine 
stuff, but there's always lots of it. Enough to keep the men and 
women who work for Reiter busy. 
Chief Reiter's proud of the team he has built. And, the team 
knows, they're lucky to have him. Reiter's extremely well qualified 
for the job. If anything, he's overqualified, with a certificate from 
the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and anti-
terrorist training at Quantico, courtesy of the FBI. It's not brought 
up often at cocktail parties in Palm Beach, but several of the 9/11 
hijackers lived in Palm Beach County. They took flight lessons at 
local airstrips. A few, including the mastermind, Mohamed Atta, 
had been regulars at 251 Sunrise, a chic nightclub in Palm Beach. 
There they had regaled any woman who would listen with 
made-up stories about their adventures as pilots. 
But 251 Sunrise is shuttered now. The joint was shut down in 
2004, after an avalanche of noise complaints. For the moment, Palm 
Beach is as quiet and calm as any place Reiter has dreamed about. 
For the moment.

CHAPTER 7 
Mary: March 2005 
J
f there's no traffic, Mary's hometown is less than thirty min-
utes away from the island of Palm Beach. But in economic 
terms it's a world away. Her high school is run by the county. 
Most of Mary's classmates are black. Thirty percent are Hispanic, 
as she is. The rest are white. The school has a C rating, and lots 
of students receive free or discounted lunches. Mary is one of 
those students. But inch by inch, she's working her way out of 
the crab barrel. A good kid, her teachers think. A kid with a 
future in front of her. 
Weeks have gone by since her meeting with Epstein. She 
hasn't told anyone about the visit. Still, other kids at the high 
school have noticed a change. 
Yo, Mary, a friend says. What's up with you anyway? 
This is a kid who veers from nice to mean, depending on 
who else is around. 
Still, a friend. 
Nothing, says Mary.

There have been rumors going around, she knows that. 
Rumors started by a girl who has eyes for Joe. 
Whore, her rival shouts in the hallway one day. 
You're the whore, Mary shouts back. 
Mary rushes the girl, who shoves back, grabbing at Mary's hair, 
twisting and tugging. Someone yells, Catfight! By the time the 
bell rings for next period, Mary's sitting in the principal's office. 
She shakes her head in reply to the questions, stays silent, 
feeling humiliated. 
Then, in her wallet, they find the three hundred dollars. 
Mary's too young and too small to be stripping. Besides, the bills 
are all twenties, not singles or fives. When they call Mary's par-
ents, her teachers suggest a more obvious explanation: Does 
Mary do drugs or deal them? 
Mary's father knows better than that. No, he insists. A psy-
chologist is called in. And then, Mary does start talking. 
Once she does, she can't stop. 
It's a wild story. Highly disturbing. A mansion in Palm Beach. 
A powerful man. This is all far from the principal's wheelhouse. 
It's definitely a matter for the police. In the meantime, the school's 
recommending a transfer, purely temporarily, to a facility for 
troubled kids—ones with issues. 
Mary's a good girl, it's true. But further confrontations at the 
high school will not be tolerated.

Michele Pagan: March 2005 
0n March 15, Palm Beach police officer Michele Pagan 
takes the first call from Mary's stepmother. 
Ma'am, she says, I'm going to have to ask you to 
come down to the station. 
I don't want to say anything more until I speak with my 
husband. 
Ma'am, I appreciate that. But I'd urge you to come in. Let us 
find out what happened. Please. 
I'll get back to you. 
Please, ma'am. I'm here for the rest of the day. We're on 
South County Road. 
At the station, Mary's father does most of the talking. 
There was an incident, he says. At school. A fight between 
Mary and another girl. But please understand, our Mary's not

used to the Gold Coast. She was educated in New York City, and, 
to her, the less affluent towns further in from the Coast might as 
well be somewhere in Georgia. Then again, she knows enough to 
know that in the back of the station, detectives are already 
whispering. 
What's a guy with that kind of money need with some girl from

Extortion? 
The kid's fourteen. What would she know from extortion? 
Have you seen the shows these kids watch? They know about

No, Pagan thinks. This is her case. 
She's the one who's going to work it.

CHAPTER 9

ary's father and stepmother believe their girl. Officer 
Pagan believes Mary's parents. Ergo, Mary must be tell-
ing the truth. The girl's got a sweet, high, halting voice. 
Pagan interviews her twice, and both times, she speaks with her 
chin buried deep in her chest. 
Tell me, honey, says Pagan. What happened? 
In her notepad, Michele Pagan writes: While speaking to me, 
Mary became upset and started to cry. 
This white-haired guy came into the room, Mary says. 
Wearing only a towel around his waist. He took off the towel. 
And then he was all naked, and he lay down on a massage table. 
He was a really built guy. But his wee-wee was very tiny. 
Mary tells Pagan that Epstein spoke only to give her instruc-
tions, which he did in a stern voice. She tells Pagan that she was 
alone and didn't know what to do.

10. 
24 
She removed her pants, leaving her thong panties on, Pagan 
writes in her incident report. 
She straddled his back, whereby her exposed buttocks were 
touching Epstein's exposed buttocks. 
Epstein then turned to his side and started to rub his penis in an 
up-and-down motion. Epstein pulled out a purple vibrator and began 
to massage Mary's vaginal area. 
Mary's sure that Epstein ejaculated. He used a towel to wipe 
himself down as he got off the table, she says. 
That week, Pagan's assigned to the case, along with six detec-
tives. Five men, two women. A predator case, one of them will 
say. This is different from someone who is stealing. This preda-
tor is a smart person, and that's his desire. He can't stop. 
Within days, another victim comes into the station. She's got 
a similar story. 
It's a tricky case, according to a source closely involved with the 
investigation, because the girls involved are far too young to use 
as bait in an attempt to catch Epstein committing another crime — 
even if they were willing to play along. Still, there are other 
strings that Chief Reiter's team can start pulling. 
Two weeks later, on March 31, Officer Pagan has Mary make 
a controlled call to Wendy Dobbs. 
The first attempt goes straight to voice mail. 
The next time Mary calls, Wendy picks up. 
On the recordings made by Officer Pagan, Mary's voice is 
tiny and tentative, while Wendy sounds mature, gruff, fully 
grown, like the femme fatale in some old black-and-white movie. 
Hey, what's up? she says impatiently. 
25 
JAMES PATTERSON 
Nothing, says Mary. 
I talked to Jeffrey, and I'm going to his house tomorrow 
morning, says Wendy. I'm going to set something up for you. 
Cool. Like, what do you think? 
I don't know. I'm going to talk to him tomorrow morning 
when I go to his house about it. 
Urn, how much would I get paid? 
Talk to him. I'll talk to him tomorrow, and then I'll bring 
you in the next day. You can talk to him about it. 
So far, so good, thinks Officer Pagan. But she needs more. She 
looks at Mary expectantly, but not too expectantly, she hopes. She 
can imagine how hard it must be for the girl. Or maybe she can't 
imagine it at all. But either way, Mary seems to have gotten the 
message. Straightening up in her chair, she begins to press Wendy. 
I don't know, Wendy says in response. I don't know. You're 
going to have to talk to him about it. I mean, I don't really work for 
him like that. I just bring girls to him and they work for him.. .. You 
can ask him, like, 'What can I do to make more money? 
Mary keeps pressing. 
The more you do, the more you get paid, Wendy says finally. 
Want me to bring my sister for you? So that we can get paid 
more or something? 
Well, yeah. That's what I'm saying. I'm working tomorrow, 
and me and him are going to put a schedule together for you and 
your sister. So I'll call you tomorrow when I leave Jeffrey with a 
schedule. 
Okay, well, I don't have a phone. So if you guys call me, I'd 
have to know what time so I could get the phone. 
Okay. I'll leave you a message. That's fine. I'll leave you a

CHAPTER JO 
Noel St. Pierre: March 2005 
Noel St. Pierre* thinks of the kids he grew up with in 
Haiti. His old neighborhood was pressed up against the 
jungle border that Haiti shares with the Dominican 
Republic, and some of the kids he knew would slip over. Those 
kids would stay in the DR for a few days, sometimes weeks. Some 
of them never returned. But the ones who did come back wouldn't 
say too much about it. 
Most of them didn't talk much at all. 
By the time he was ten, Noel had learned the truth about 
those kids. He'd learned that they'd ended up working as 
prostitutes. 
This was how Noel St. Pierre had learned about evil. There 
really were devils out in the world. Flesh-and-blood devils, and 
* Noel St. Pierre is a composite character. 
27 
JAMES PATTERSON 
they were nothing like the demons he'd heard about in church. 
Noel had never forgotten the way those kids looked. The way 
they'd turned into old men and old women. They were like zom-
bies trapped in children's bodies. And now, in America, Noel's 
been given a chance to help other kids. 
That's what the police have told him, at least. 
Noel is a sanitation worker. Still strong at fifty, and lucky 
enough to have found his way to Palm Beach, he gets in to work 
before anyone else and keeps his white compactor truck clean, 
almost glistening. His pickup route runs hot and cold with the 
seasons. But even in the summer, with much less to do, he's on 
the job early, braced for a six-hour shift that would break a lesser 
man's back. In the winter, the job gets even harder. The Estate 
Section gets especially busy. Some of the parties have hundreds 
of guests. They leave behind mountains of refuse. That garbage 
gets picked up daily, or twice a day when requested. It's carried 
by workers who slip, silently, under the porte cocheres. Then it 
gets whisked twenty miles away to a landfill that the garbage-
men call Mount Trashmore. 
Noel's stretch of the Estate Section runs from the Everglades 
Club to the southernmost tip of the island. It encompasses Ban-
yan Road, Jungle Road, El Bravo Way, and El Brill° Way. His per-
formance record is spotless. As far as the Palm Beach PD is 
concerned, he's the perfect man for the job. 
Chief Reiter's authorized a trash pull —a legal way to collect 
discarded evidence. In this case, evidence culled from Jeffrey 
Epstein's garbage. But when the police call him, Noel St. Pierre 
simply assumes that another refugee boat has run aground on

the beach. A sad thing, but something that does happen from 
time to time. His homeland, Haiti, is desperately poor. Run by 
despots who line their pockets while everyday people suffer. 
Many of the refugees are illiterate. 
Most of them speak only Creole. 
Eske ou ha ede nou, souple, they ask. 
Can you help us, please? 
The cops always need a translator, and Noel's been asked to 
help out before. But this time the police officer's voice is raspy, 
impatient. 
This time is different, the officer says. Something very 
special. You don't have to accept. But if you do, you'll have to 
keep things to yourself, completely. 
When he hears what the story is, Noel accepts. 
I'll do it, he says immediately. 
The address he's been given is 358 El Brillo Way. On his first 
morning, St. Pierre moves swiftly, sneaking a glance through the 
kitchen window at the four silhouettes standing inside. Three 
women, one of them quite short, with pigtails. 
The fourth silhouette is that of a tall man. 
The police have given him clear instructions. The work is 
unsavory, but so is the work Noel does every day. What the 
detectives want from him now are slips of paper with phone 
numbers, along with toothbrushes, condoms, discarded under-
wear. Anything that could provide DNA. He's been told to use a 
special truck on the El Brillo run. Whatever he finds he's to put 
aside in small trash bags he'll deliver directly to the station at the 
end of every shift. 
29 
JAMES PATTERSON 
Jeffrey Epstein's garbage will never arrive at Mount Trashmore. 
As he drives to the police station, St. Pierre thinks about 
Epstein and what he's been told. It's a wonder to him that Ameri-
can kids would do what the police say these kids have done. 
American kids are rich, after all. Some of them just don't know it, 
he guesses. 
Americans always want more than they have. 
Then again, children do stupid things. They don't know any 
better. And St. Pierre's trips to the house make one thing clear. 
These girls are young. Really young. 
I hope you can stop this man, St. Pierre tells the cop. 
The detective shoots him a sharp look, and St. Pierre nods. 
Please, he says, more softly this time. 
Can we count on seeing you here tomorrow? 
The detective looks antsy, impatient again. In his hand he's 
holding a scrap of paper that Noel St. Pierre has pulled from 
Epstein's trash. Wendy Dobbs's name is on it. Mary's name is on 
it as well. 
The detective can't wait to get it to Chief Reiter's office. 
As long as it takes, sir, St. Pierre tells him. Tomorrow, the 
next day. Whenever you need me.

CHAPTER II 
Michael Reiter: September 2005 
There's a sense in which the Palm Beach PD functions as a 
foundation. From time to time, one of the town's wealthy 
residents will walk in with a check followed by an inquiry. 
How much more would the police force need to make this 
remarkably safe community feel even safer? 
A tax write-off? Sure. But why not? Coming from most, it's a 
genuine gesture. One of appreciation for all they have and for all 
the department's efforts to guard it. Donations are accepted gra-
ciously, gratefully. In 2004, the department had taken one from 
Jeffrey Epstein—the second donation he'd made to the Palm 
Beach PD—for ninety thousand dollars. Generous, even by the 
generous standards of Palm Beach. The donation, which Epstein 
delivered personally, was earmarked for a firearms training sim-
ulator. But that day Michael Reiter had thought something seemed 
off about Epstein. 
31 
JAMES PATTERSON 
Something an old cop would notice. 
Reiter's officers had told him about complaints they'd gotten 
a few months earlier—young women hanging around at the end 
of the block or coming and going at all hours from Epstein's 
house. There was some follow-up to that, Reiter said in a depo-
sition for B.B. vs. Epstein, a civil suit, brought by a victim, that 
Jeffrey eventually settled. I think we may have encountered one 
or two of them. [We] may have done a little bit of surveillance or 
talked to neighbors as to whether or not they had seen that. I 
think we were of the general understanding that, yes, there were 
very attractive young women coming and going from Mr. 
Epstein's residence. 
We did some level of further inquiry, and we were of the 
belief that they were all adults. And [we] were also of the belief 
that there was a possibility that there could be prostitution. But I 
mean that's just not something that we heavily pursued—
prostitution in private residences; it's common everywhere in 
America. We didn't believe that they were underage at that point, 
and so we had no further interest in it. 
Reiter had recalled those complaints on the day Epstein had 
shown up with his $90,000 donation. And when Reiter had 
walked Epstein downstairs, he couldn't help but notice the tall, 
beautiful woman whom Epstein had brought with him to the 
station. 
It struck him as strange that she was standing so stiffly, eyes 
cast downward, as though she were afraid to speak. Not a kid. 
But not a woman, either. Epstein did not introduce or even 
acknowledge her. To Reiter, this, too, seemed odd. 
Indeed, the statuesque woman was Nadia Marcinkova, a

,man was Nadia Marcinkova, a 
32 
nineteen-year-old beauty who lived at Epstein's home and was 
described, by another girl, in a recorded interview with Detec-
tive Recarey, as one of Epstein's like, slaves. 
In September, several months into the investigation, Epstein 
calls Reiter directly and asks: Has Palm Beach bought the fire-
arms simulator yet? 
Cautiously, Reiter tells him that they're still doing research. 
If the department needs more funds, Epstein says, he'll be 
happy to provide them. 
Reiter thanks him graciously and hangs up. But he's certain 
now that Epstein knows about the investigation. Thinking about 
Epstein's crimes in Palm Beach makes him shudder. And, Reiter 
knows, if the charges are true, things are going to get ugly and 
public. 
Cops like Reiter are family men, fathers. Some see so much 
that they're no longer surprised by the ways of the world. Still, it 
helps to hold on to a natural capacity for outrage. Thefts are easy 
to understand: you see something you need, so you take it. Even 
murders make a kind of sense once you understand the motiva-
tion. There's great satisfaction in catching a murderer. But what 
Epstein's been up to is hard to explain. 
Who is this guy? 
Reiter's detectives will have to get into Epstein's head. To nail 
him, they'll have to know him. And to do that, they'll have to get 
to know the people around him. The police already know about 
Wendy. That's one procurer, but out of how many? 
What kind of person would bring children to a child molester? 
33 
JAMES PATTERSON 
And—Reiter can't shake the idea—other victims had to be 
out there. That lined up with what Epstein's neighbor reported: 
there were many girls. He needed to find them as quickly as pos-
sible. It was a race against time. 
As long as Epstein was free in Palm Beach, more girls were 
sure to arrive at the side of the house on El Brillo Way.

It might start with the Palm Beach Daily News, which usually 
covers charity balls, equestrian events, and gallery openings. 
Reporters there would kill to sink their teeth into something 
so juicy. On top of that, Chief Reiter knows, Palm Beach is full of 
freelance paparazzi and seasoned semiretired journalists. 
They'd kill for the story, too. For them, it'd be a real-life Body 
Heat. 
Over at WPTV, the local NBC affiliate, the phone rings 
one day. 
It's a tip from a kid, sounding nervous. Something about girls 
from a local high school. 
There's a prostitution ring out in Palm Beach, says the boy. 
The tip gets brought up in a midmorning meeting at which 
the producers divvy up ideas among the various reporters and 
newscasts.

Where, exactly? a producer asks. 
He didn't say, exactly, an intern replies. He said that a very 
rich man was involved. 
Who? 
Didn't say. 
Did he leave a call-back number? 
No. The kid sounded really young. Fourteen, fifteen years 
old. 
The producer thinks for a moment, makes a few scratches in 
his dog-eared notepad. 
Okay, he says. I'm not sure what we can do with that for 
the moment. 
At some point, some enterprising journalist will put enough 
pieces together to get a sense of the picture. Sooner or later, 
someone will talk. Maybe a parent. Maybe a cop's girlfriend gets 
giddy at lunch. The girlfriend's girlfriend mentions it to her hus-
band, who says something to a golfing buddy in turn. Maybe the 
golfing buddy knows a reporter. 
Or maybe some lawyer goes off the rez, blitzed off those mar-
tinis they serve at the Palm Beach Grill. 
Sooner or later, there's always talk. At that point, Chief Reit-
er's job will get much, much harder —with Epstein on one side, 
the press on the other, and the chief taking flak from all sides. 
But right now, two months into Reiter's investigation, the press 
is still speaking in whispers. 
Right now, Reiter wants to keep it that way. 
And, in the meantime, new pieces of the puzzle keep falling 
into place.

pieces of the puzzle keep falling 
36 
On September 11, a young woman named Alison gets pulled 
over by the police.* She's carrying a small amount of marijuana. 
The patrol officer handcuffs her and puts her in the back of his 
vehicle. But Alison's been in the back of a police car before, and 
she's cocky and canny enough to pivot the conversation away 
from the dime bag she's been busted with. She tells the officer a 
remarkable story about an older man engaging in sexual activi-
ties with high school girls. Alison knows about it firsthand, she 
says. She's been going to the house on El Brillo Way since she 
was sixteen. 
At first the cop's skeptical. He hasn't heard about the investi-
gation into Jeffrey Epstein's affairs. And, after all, Alison is a 
burnout. But back at the station, he finds out that Alison has not 
been bullshitting him. 
The investigation is real. 
Alison's name and cell phone number match up with messages 
that have been pulled from Epstein's trash. Instead of copping to 
a misdemeanor, she becomes another Jane Doe in the case that 
Chief Reiter's colleague, Detective Joe Recarey, is building against 
Jeffrey Epstein. 
The story Alison ends up telling is extremely disturbing. 
Like Mary, she says, she was recruited in high school. She 
tells cops that Epstein would call her his number one girl — 
although, she suspects, there were many others. 
Recarey takes her statement. In the excerpts that follow 
(transcribed from a tape recording made by the Palm Beach 
police), D stands for Detective Recarey, and V stands for 
victim. 
* Alison's name, some identifying details, and dialogue have been changed.

Well, ah, start from, like, how you met him, and then I'll — 
I'll take you through. 
Okay. Um, we [Alison and a female friend] worked at Hollister 
together in the Wellington Green mall, and I was mentioning 
to her how I wanted extra money to go to Maine ...I wanted to 
go camping for the summer, and I couldn't afford a plane 
ticket. And—she goes, Oh, well, you can get a plane ticket in 
two hours. I said, What are you talking about? Like, what 
are you—that didn't make any sense to me, a plane ticket in 
two hours; what are you talking about? And she goes, Oh, we 
can go give this guy a massage, and, um, he'll pay two hundred 
dollars for, like, forty-five minutes or an hour. And that's all 
she told me—no details, no nothing. 
She said that he wanted cute girls, so I looked cute, did my 
best. I didn't—I didn't think that it was what it was. I wasn't 
naive enough to think that he was gonna pay me two hun-
dred dollars just for nothing—I, I don't know, like, I don't 
know what was going through my head. I absolutely don't 
know. And I— the back of my mind was thinking, oh, well, 
it could be legitimate, but I was also thinking, you know, at 
the same time, is she fucking crazy? Like, this guy's not 
gonna pay you money for not doing anything, not letting him 
cop a feel or nothing. You know? So I didn't know what to 
think, I was like, Oh ... if he does something that I have a 
problem with, then I'll leave. 
D: Who were you introduced to? 
V: One of his girlfriends. One of his, like, slaves that he has live 
with him. And when I say slaves, like, one of the girls that

Sarah. Urn, that's his assistant, I think. I think they have sex, 
but I don't know. Um, I was introduced to his assistant Sarah, 
and she's the one who told me that he would be ready in a 
second. And from there I met various other girls. I don't 
really—I didn't pay attention to who they were, though.... 
So ... we were waiting on the couch in the bathroom, and, 
urn, Jeffrey comes up, and he's like, Hey, I'm—I'm Jeffrey. 
He just introduced himself, and he hands—I remember this 
'cause I was pissed off that she got paid to bring me. Like, I 
was pissed off. He hands her a wad of hundred-dollar bills 
and says, Thank you, and she says, I'll wait for you down-
stairs, and I was like, All right, I'll see you in a little while. 
And that's how I was brought to Jeffrey. 
Urn. Hold on—I'm remembering. I'm, like, picturing in my 
head. I wore a skirt. I remember specifically what I wore: I 
wore a skirt and just a regular T-shirt. And I was massaging 
his legs, and he asked me to take off my skirt. And I said—I 
think I said no at first. And he's like, Come on, you're not 
showing —he talked me into it, basically. He's like, Oh, 
you're not showing anything, or [he] did something; I don't 
even know. So I ended up taking off my skirt, and then he 
goes—well, I think he just started touching, you know, the 
top of me. So—and then he asked me. 
When you're saying the top of you, you mean your 
breasts? 
Yeah. And then he asked me to take off my shirt. So I took off 
my shirt, but I kept my underwear on. And I wouldn't take 
39 
JAMES PATTERSON 
my underwear off: I told him no. And he still paid me the 
same amount. And that was that. I went home. 
D: So, in other words, he — 
V: Finished with himself and that was it. Yeah, he ejaculated. 
Specifically. 
D: That was the first time you went there? 
V: Mm-hmm. 
D: And—I know, take a deep breath, I know, I can see it in your 
eyes already. From then on, you went there multiple times? 
V: I had problems with it. [With] what happened the first time. 
But three hundred dollars for forty minutes—that was a lot 
for a sixteen-year-old girl making six bucks an hour. 
D: So you're saying you're sure you were sixteen now? 
V: Urn, I don't want to say I'm sure of my age. I was under seven-
teen, one hundred percent. 
D: Okay. Urn, when you—the first time you went, when he 
masturbated, did you see? 
V: [giggles] 
D: His member? 
V: Oh, I thought you were going to ask me if I saw, like, his come. 
D: No. 
V: I saw all of the above. 
D: You saw him naked, fully naked? Fully naked? 
V: Yeah, a hundred percent naked. He had a towel on for some 
of it, but that doesn't mean anything. Like, he was naked. 
D: He took off the towel?

I mean, I'm sorry, he is circumcised, my bad. He's circum-
cised, a hundred and ten percent sure. A matter of fact, he 
has some sort of birth defect. On his thing. I don't know what 
it is [giggles]; I've never really looked at it, because I've never 
done anything where I had to touch it. I've never touched 
it— out of the whole time I worked for him, I never touched 
his penis. Like, he—I'm pretty sure he rubbed it against me, 
but I've never ever been, like, Okay, I'm letting you do this 
or I'm gonna do this to you. Um, it's really weirdly shaped. 
I don't know— do you want me to, like, tell you this? 
I'm just really embarrassed. Urn, it's like a teardrop, like a 
drop of water. It's really fat at the bottom and skinny at the 
top, where it's attached. And he never gets fully hard, ever. 
Like, I just could tell by looking at it—like, by looking you 
can obviously tell if you're hard or not, and I could tell that 
he wasn't. 
D: The next time you went, or as you continued to go, did it 
escalate more? 
V. Mm-hmm. I actually—I don't remember how long it took for 
me to start working for him regularly, from the first time I 
went there. But I started working every day. Every single day 
he was in the country I would be there ... And, urn, I told 
him that I wouldn't let him put anything inside of me; that 
was my rule. Nothing inside of me—no fingers, no, no noth-
ing, absolutely nothing inside of me. He increased my pay to 
three or four hundred dollars as long as he could touch me. 
Um, I still never—I, I swear I never touched him, the whole 
t, entire time I never, ever touched him. Urn, but he, he-

JAMES PATTERSON 
D: How many times would you say you went? 
V: Hundreds. Hundreds. I was—he used to tell me I was his 
favorite. He bought me a car. He bought me — 
D: This Jeep that you're driving? 
V: No. I had a brand-new Dodge Neon. I got a plane—I got a 
plane ticket to New York; I got spending money whenever I 
wanted. Like, I was in there deep. I was—he asked my par-
ents to emancipate me so I could live with him. Or he didn't 
ask my parents, he asked me to ask my parents, I'm sorry. He 
actually wanted me to come live with him. 
D: As, like, a girlfriend? 
V: Sex slave, whatever you want to call it. Yeah. Urn, but it 
escalated—he, he just increased my pay, as long as he could 
touch me. I wouldn't let him put anything inside of me. And 
then one day he just did, one day he just put his hand, like, 
his fingers—and, urn... 
D: How long, would you say, from the very first time you went? 
V: Months. Honestly, I never kept track, like, of, of what happened 
when. I just can tell you in which order things progressed. 
It was—it was, like, towards the middle and end of my 
school year. But I remember that for the last, like, six or eight 
weeks of high school, I didn't have a car 'cause I gave it back 
to him. Because he—he asked me to have sex with him and, 
like, like suck him and stuff [giggles], and I was just like, no. 
Definitely not. I was like, I'll let you touch me, but I'm not 
gonna do that. 
Yeah, the car was a Dodge Neon 2005. He got it for me before 
the New Year, because I remember I got it—it was an edition

got a 2005 Neon in 2004. Seven miles on it when I got it. The 
car was awesome [giggles]. 
I gave it back before I graduated. It got too—it got too sticky 
for me. He wanted more than I was willing to give. I didn't 
wanna — I didn't want to, um, suck his dick. I didn't want to 
have sex with him. I never did that, and I wanted to be able 
to walk away from this saying that I—saying that I never did 
that. And I'm glad that I did. 
But I lied to him when I gave it back. I didn't want to burn my 
bridges, because he was a spectacular connection to have. 
Spectacular. Even if I didn't—even when I didn't work for 
him. Until this day, he is so aw— he is so—I haven't talked 
to him in, like, a couple months, but if I called him today he 
would give me as much money as I asked him for. He doesn't 
know that I hate him the way I do. I kept that connection. I 
figured he used me, I'd be able to use him. Urn, I hate to say 
that, but I figured if I wanted to use him I could. 
D: Okay. Let me bring you back a little bit. 
V: Sure. 
D: When did things start to escalate as far as things happening 
when the massages were given? 
V: They escalated whenever he wanted. I don't clearly under-
stand the question. 
D: Okay. The first time you went, you were naked — 
V: Are you asking for a date? 
D: Oh, no, no, no-
43 
JAMES PATTERSON 
V: ... and the little steps that things progressed? 
D: Right. 
V: Well, I went and I wouldn't take off my panties at first. And 
then he got me to get naked. Then he got me to let him rub me. 
Then he got me to let him stick his fingers in me. Then he got 
me to let him go down on me. Then, um—that was pretty 
much the gist of it, except this one time, where he bent me over 
the table and put himself in me. Without my permission. And I 
flipped out. I'm sorry, I didn't ask you, but I don't count that as 
me having sex with him.... 'Cause I just told you that I never 
had sex with him. I never did. Even though, I don't know what 
you'd consider that. But he then—I go, What are you doing? 
He goes, Oh, I just wanted [redacted] to see this. 
D: Okay. Let me back you up. When you were completely naked, 
the same things happened? You went in, you massaged him? 
V: Sometimes I didn't even do that. Sometimes he just asked me 
to take off my clothes and—he'd have to do work, he'd be 
sitting at his desk or something, and I'd just be naked there, 
watching television or reading a book, but I'd be naked. Or, 
um, sometimes he wanted to just watch TV or read, and he'd 
lay in his bed and ask me to take my clothes off and lay with 
him. And that's it. Not touch him or anything.... Sometimes 
he'd just invite me over for breakfast, for dinner, or just to 
use the swimming pool, and I'd get paid for that, too. I'd get 
paid just to hang out with him. That's it. And if the money 
wasn't there, I wouldn't have ever been in that house. 
D: Okay. When he started to touch you — 
V: I have a question. Before I say anything else. Urn, is there a 
possibility that I'm gonna have to go to court or anything? 
Like, that's a possibility, right?

he did to you is a crime. I'm not gonna lie to you. 
V: Would you consider it rape? Like, would you consider that to 
be rape, what he did? 
I/ If he put himself inside you, without permission — 
V: I didn't say that, or anything. I was standing up and the table 
is about, like, my hip length—he just put me down — 
D: That, that is a crime. That is a crime. 
V: I don't want my family to find out about this. My family 
doesn't know any of this. My mom thinks I was his secretary,

thinks I made phone calls for him and that's how I was mak-

before? 
V: Well, I've heard him make threats to people on the telephone, 
yeah. Of course.

V: All the above! But that's not the point. 
D: Who's he talking to?

V: I don't know. I don't know, I heard those conversations, I 
mean, I've been in the room when he was on the phone and 
[unintelligible] threatened. Like, I witnessed lots of things. I 
just don't know what, specifically you all [want to know]. 
D: Everything. 
V: I used to go there every day, like I w —I don't, I don't know 
how many other girls he was saying, You're my favorite, and 
I want you to live with me to, but I was in about as deep as 
you can get. 
D: He had quite a few girls he would say that to. 
D: Do you have any formal massage training? 
V: [Giggles.] Hell, no. 
D: All right, I was just asking. 
V: He would kiss me and stuff, too. I remember that. And when 
he kissed me, if he was jerking off he would, like, rub him-
self on my breasts. And I ... I was extremely uncomfortable. I 
would maneuver myself away from that activity. I'd get up 
and I'd move somewhere else, or I'd—I don't even remember. 
I would stop whatever was going on without saying, Can 
you get the fuck off me? I would stop it without saying stuff 
like that. 
D: Okay. 
V: I wouldn't let him put anything in me until one day he did 
just out of nowhere. And I said, Wait a second: my boyfriend, 
you know, we had this thing, you can't do that. You know, 
I'm —I'm allowed to work here as long as you don't do that. 
And he said okay. Well, a couple months later I guess he

assumed me and my boyfriend had broken up, and he just did 
it one day; he just did it without asking or anything. And then 
I said, What are you doing? I said, You know that's not 
cool, and he goes, Oh, I thought we did that last time. And 
I said, No, we did not do that last time. And then he goes—
uh, and then he just offered me more money. He's like, Well, 
why don't I just give you something extra, and we can try this 
out? Arid I was like [sigh], All right. Very hard guy to say 
no to. I don't know if. any of you guys ever talked to him.... 
Oh, yeah. Well, if you talk to him, I mean, he straight up 
tries to control the situation. Every—every word that comes 
out of your mouth, it seems like, he knows what you are 
going to say. Like, that's his job; that's how he made his 
money is knowing what people are gonna say and what peo-
ple are gonna do. 
What did he tell you he does for a living? 
Well, there's a couple of things. Things that I found for 
myself, things I looked up on the Internet. What he specifi-
cally told me when I asked him the first time was, Oh, I'm a 
brain scientist. And I said, What the fuck is a brain scien-
tist? I was like, That's not a real job—tell me the truth. 
But anyway ... his explanation was, It's my job to know how 
people's brains work. And I said, Whatever the fuck that 
means. Whatever. You're like some old guy who [unintelligi-

held on so long is, he promised me that I would get into NYU. 
That I would get into NYU and he would pay for it. And I 
waited, and I waited, and I scored great on my SATs, I would 
get 4.0—like, I did great in school. I filled out my application

and he told me that it wasn't good enough. So I filled it out 
again, and it was like three times. So I'm pretty sure he wasn't 
checking into it, he was just telling me that he was. But I

Inch by inch, they move their case toward the goalpost. But 
in October, Detective Recarey and his coworkers catch a break 
that moves the ball several yards down the field. 
On the first Monday of that month, they pick Wendy up at her 
house and, down at the police station, she starts to sing—like a bird. 
The detectives can hardly believe it or get it all down fast 
enough. Later on, in a probable-cause affidavit, Detective Recarey 
will write:

ched by a friend named Molly at

the Canopy Beach Resort in Riviera Beach. [Dobbs] was 
asked if she wanted to make money. She was told she would 
have to provide a massage and should make $200. [Dobbs] 
thought about the offer and agreed to meet with Jeffrey. 
Molly (Unknown last name) and Tony (Unknown last 
name) picked [Dobbs] up and she was taken to Epstein's 
house. Upon her arrival to the house she was introduced to 
Epstein in the kitchen of the house. She was also intro-
duced to a white female known to her as Sarah. She was led 
upstairs to the main bedroom known to her as Jeff Epstein's 
bedroom. 
Sarah arranged the massage table and covered the table 
with a sheet. She brought out the massage oils and laid them 
next to the massage bed. Sarah then left the room and 
informed [Dobbs] Jeff would be in, in a minute. Jeff entered 
the bedroom wearing only a towel. 
He removed the towel and laid nude on the massage 
table. He laid on the table onto his stomach and picked a 
massage oil for [Dobbs] to rub on him. 
He tried to touch me, and I stopped him, says Dobbs. 
I asked how he tried to touch her. [Dobbs] stated that Epstein 
grabbed her buttocks and she felt uncomfortable. 
I'll massage you, Dobbs had told Epstein. But I don't want 
to be touched. 
[Dobbs] stated she performed the massage naked. At the con-
clusion of the massage, Epstein paid [Dobbs] $200. 
53 
JAMES PATTERSON 
After the massage Epstein stated to [Dobbs] that he 
understood she was not comfortable, but he would pay her if 
she brought over some girls. He told her the younger the bet-
ter. (Dobbs] stated she once tried to bring a 23-year-old 
female and Epstein stated that the female was too old. 
(Dobbs] stated that in total she only remembers six girls that 
she brought to see Epstein. Each time she was paid $200. 
[Dobbs] said at the time she brought these girls to Epstein's 
house they were all 14 through 16 [years] of age. 
Wendy Dobbs keeps talking. What she says about Mary's 
visit lines up neatly with what Mary's already told the police. 
Wendy's own experience with Epstein syncs up, too. But Wen-
dy's not a victim, as Mary is. After all, she's been playing on 
Epstein's team. Team predator. 
A police sergeant enters the room. What he wants to know is, 
does Wendy realize that she's implicated herself in Epstein's 
crimes? 
Beads of sweat form on Wendy's forehead, and now the police 
know they've really got her. She gives them phone numbers to go 
with the young girls she's named. She provides addresses. But 
no, Wendy doesn't quite get it. On the way home, in a police car, 
she brags in the backseat: 
I'm like a Heidi Fleiss, she tells the escorting officers.

I do want to talk you about Jeff Epstein, and the whole...

RECAREY: It's up to you. If you wanted one, you can have one. 
I can't tell you yes or no on that. That's totally [up] to you, I'm 
only — 
DOBBS: I'm not gonna get in trouble for anything I say, right? 
RECAREY: Right now, you're just a witness. I'm talking to you as 
a witness.... That's totally up to you. You wanna talk to me? 
DOBBS: I have no problem telling you everything I know. I'm a 
very cooperative person. 
RECAREY: Okay. How did you first meet, um.—
DOBBS: I first met Jeffrey—I was at a beach resort on Singer 
Island, and I was approached by this girl I went to school 
with. Her name was [redacted]. And she was asking me, you 
know, Oh, you need extra money, I know this guy.... I 
thought about it and I finally gave her a call, and her and her 
friend [redacted] met up with me. I actually picked them up 
and we drove down to Jeffrey's house. She introduced me, 
whatever. 
RECAREY: Okay. Now, what [do] you mean by making money, 
how do you make money with Jeffrey? 
DOBBS: Um, there's two ways. There's two ways you can make 
money. He'll, all right — 
RECAREY: That's all right. Talk to me. Talk to me like, like 
nothin'. 
DOBBS: How do I say— this is going to sound really sleazy, but 
RECAREY: No. Go ahead. Talk to me. 
DOBBS: Every girl that meets Jeffrey starts off with giving him a 
massage. The more you do with him, the more you make. 
Basically, if you take off your clothes, you're gonna make more. 
If you let him do things to you, you're gonna make more. 
RECAREY: Like do things you mean, touch you?

56 
FILTHY RICH 
DOBBS: Yeah. Touch you in inappropriate places. 
RECAREY: Okay. Does he use his hand? Does he — 
DOBBS: He uses his hands and, I really wouldn't call it a vibrator — 
I guess it's like a massager? But urn—I was one of the girls 
that refused to do that. I did it basically my—I did it naked, 
but I wouldn't let him touch me or anything like that. So after 
that he's like, You know what? He's like, Listen, I'll pay 
you $200 for every girl that you bring to me. He's like, I 
don't want you to massage me anymore, you know, just bring 
girls to me.... So that's the other way you can make money. 
For every girl that you bring to the table—so, for every girl 
that I brought to Jeffrey—I would make $200. Flat. Just right 
there. 
RECAREY: Just to bring a girl. 
DOBBS: Yeah. Just to bring a girl. 
RECAREY: Okay. And the girl that was going knew that she 
would have to massage him. 
DOBBS: She knew everything. She knew everything. That was 
one of Jeffrey's rules. He had a problem with girls coming to 
the house that didn't know what they were getting into. He 
would tell me, you know, Make sure these girls know what I 
expect, make sure they know what they want, because when 
I get in that room I don't want them to—you know—they 
need to know. And, as far as [redacteas case, she knew 
everything she was getting herself into. It was all volunteer. 
RECAREY: Okay. What did you tell her that she was gonna do? 
DOBBS: I told her the same thing. I told her, you know, this guy 
Jeffrey—she came to me saying she needed money, da da da. 
I basically told her about it. She was like, urn, you know, 
What do you have to do? I told her. I was like, The more

you're gonna have to go up there. You're gonna take your 
clothes off. But the more you do, is the more you make. She 
walked out of there with $300. So she obviously and evi-
dently let him do a little more. Plus, on our way home, she 
kinda told me what she did. 
RECAREY: Which was? Give the massage.... 
DOBBS: She gave the massage, and she basically let him, like, 
touch her, down there. Basically. 
RECAREY: Did he touch her with his hands? 
DOBBS: All with his hands. And then he brought out the mas-
sager. From what she told me. 
RECAREY: How old were you when you were approached to see 
Jeffrey? 
DOBBS: Um, I think I was seventeen? 
RECAREY: Seventeen. 
DOBBS: Sixteen or seventeen. 
RECAREY: Okay. When was the last time you talked to him? 
DOBBS: It's been a while. I can honestly say it's probably been 
about close to a year. About a year. I actually stopped work-
ing for him. 
RECAREY: Who was the last girl you brought over?

DOBBS: The more she'd make. 
RECAREY: The more she got paid. 
DOBBS: Yeah. 
RECAREY: So, she had intercourse with him. 
DOBBS: Urn, I don't know about the intercourse. I heard differ-
ent stories on that. I've never asked him Oh, you know ... 
But when I was first introduced to him, my friend [redacted] 
who introduced me to him, told me that she knew a girl who 
slept with him and made $1,000. But from what his intern—
or secretary—told me, is that he doesn't do that. He just 
plays around with them. So I heard two different stories. 
RECAREY: So, when you went and you massaged him, nothing 
happened between you two. 
DOBBS: Nothing. I wouldn't let him. 
RECAREY: Okay. Did he become forceful? Did he get upset? 
DOBBS: I wouldn't say he became upset. I think he was a little disap-
pointed. But I'm not—I didn't care. I knew I was getting paid. I 
let him—I let him look, but I never let him touch. It was out of 
the question for him. And I think that's pretty much why he just, 
kind of down-promoted me? He was just kind of like, You can 
bring girls. But as far as working, you know—
RECAREY: Okay. How many girls have you brought to him, 
aside from [redacted]? 
DOBBS: Oh. Urn. A lot. 
RECAREY: A lot? 
DOBBS: Um, let's see, there's [several redacted names].... 
RECAREY: And all these girls knew what they had to do? 
DOBBS: Every one of them.

RECAREY: How long have you been working for him? 
DOBBS: Um ...I probably worked for him for a year. 
RECAREY: Okay. And out of all these girls... 
DOBBS: Those were all the girls I brought. But you have to 
remember, those girls brought other girls, too. 
RECAREY: Oh, okay. 
DOBBS: So it's like—it's like a train. It's like, I introduced him to 
all my friends, and then ... it goes on and on, like that 
RECAREY: Okay.... [Redacted] being fourteen or fifteen at the

DOBBS: Underage, what do you mean? 
RECAREY: Under eighteen. 
DOBBS: Under eighteen? All of 'ern 
RECAREY: All of them? 
DOBBS: All of them.... 
RECAREY: Okay. Did Jeff know anybody's real true age? Or he 
didn't care. 
DOBBS: I don't think he cared. He told me the younger the better. 
RECAREY: The younger the better. All right. 
DOBBS: Pretty much. That's how it worked. He didn't—let me 
just put it this way: I tried to bring him a woman who was 
twenty-three, and he didn't really like it. 
RECAREY: Didn't go for it. 
DOBBS: It's not that he didn't go for it. He just didn't care for it. 
And he likes the girls that [are] between the ages of, like, 
eighteen and twenty.... But some of them, I think, lie about 
their age. I know that when 1 started off young, I think he

DOBBS: Okay. 
RECAREY: [Mary] at the time was dating your cousin, right? 
DOBBS: Mm-hmm. 
RECAREY: Okay. She told you she needed to make money. Did 
she know you worked for Jeffrey? 
DOBBS: I told her. 
RECAREY: You had told her you worked for Jeffrey. 
DOBBS: Mm-hmm. 
RECAREY: Did you tell her what it entailed? So she knew that? 
DOBBS: She knew everything before she even agreed to it. 
RECAREY: Okay. So she knew that there was going to have to be 
some kind of—
DOBBS: Contact. Pretty much. Yeah. I told her. I told her exactly 
what his expectations were. I told her what goes on with the 
girls that go up there. I told her—it was like, It's your call. 
I was like, If you want to do this, fine. If not, fine. But when 
you go in that room, I don't want to hear you say, 'Oh, I didn't 
know he was going to do all that.' Because I'm telling you 
right now, he's expecting it. 
RECAREY: Basically, this is touching—
DOBBS: Fondling—
RECAREY: Fondling — 
DOBBS: Or whatever. And I told her when she went on her own. 
Just like, Just remember, the more you do, the more you 
make. But that's—that's up to you. And she asked me, and I 
brought up, told her I wouldn't do more. 
61 
JAMES PATTERSON 
RECAREY: Okay. You made that clear, you wouldn't do more. 
DOBBS: No. Screw that! 
RECAREY: But as far as Mary] is concerned. What did she tell 
you that happened in that room? 
DOBBS: Exact words? If I can recall, when she came downstairs 
from—when she came downstairs, me and her and [redacted 
we all walked out. We got into the car. And I was like, How 
much did you make? She's like, Three hundred dollars. And I 
looked at [Mary] and I just knew right then she did more. 
RECAREY: Than just a massage, right? 
DOBBS: Yeah. And I asked her. I was like, Well, what'd you do? 
She's like, Well, I started giving a massage, and then my 
clothes came off and, you know, he put his fingers inside me. 
And then he brought out the massager. And that's basically 
what she said. 
RECAREY: It's all right. You can talk to me. It's all right. 
DOBBS: It's kind of incredible talking about it, now that I—I 
can't believe I worked for him. 
RECAREY: But it's okay. You know what, we all go through 
things in life, you know what I mean? It's an experience. And 
you can put this experience behind you. 
Do girls that—people that you brought over—how did you 
approach them? That they were going to have to do this... 
Like, if they wanted to work, how did you approach them? 
Say, Listen, I got this guy in Palm Beach? 
DOBBS: Urn. .. Two of them were my friends. The others were, 
like, my acquaintances. It was a little more easier talking to 
them about it, 'cause, like, I knew them.

RECAREY: Take a deep breath. Take a deep breath. 'Cause I can 
see you're working up again. You're working up the tears, I 
can see it, and I don't want to get you like that. 
DOBBS: I, urn, pretty much I just would ask them — 
RECAREY: Straight up? 
DOBBS: If you're looking for extra money, let me know; this guy 
down in Palm Beach, he's really, really, really wealthy. You 
have to give him a massage. That's all I would tell them. 
Then, if they were interested or told me, Yes, I want to do it, 
I'd go into detail with them before they'd actually agree. If 
they told me, Yeah, that sounds good, I'm interested, then 
I'd tell them, Okay, well I'm gonna let you know, this is what 
you have to do, this is what's gonna go on. 
RECAREY: Did you tell them that you were going to make money 
from bringing them over? Or.—. 
DOBBS: Most part? I believe they knew.... Most of the girls, we 
were open about that. We didn't—they pretty much knew I 
was making money under the table. So...

Gimme two seconds. 
All right, I talked to my boss a little bit — 
FRICK: —Which is why I'm here. 
DOBBS: Okay. 
FRICK: Obviously I was listening to what you were saying. And 
at this point you clearly implicated yourself on a crime, okay? 
You've taken girls to somebody's house for the purpose of 
prostitution. More importantly, more significantly, one of 
those girls was fourteen at the time, okay? Now that's a pretty 
significant second-degree felony, okay? I'm not going to kid

JAMES PATTERSON 
you, that is— it's a significant thing, okay? Now, you came 
in, you cooperated with us. The question we have for you 
now is, do you want to continue cooperating with us and try 
and help us make a case against Jeff? 
DOBBS: I don't think that's really going to help me in the long 
run, though. I've already admitted to a second-degree felony, 
right? 
FRICK: Yeah, you have. 
DOBBS: Okay, so there you go. What's going to keep me out of 
trouble? It's not going to keep me out of trouble. I've already 
admitted committing a crime. 
FRICK: I'm not going to argue with that.... 
DOBBS: So basically I just fucked myself. I can go two ways. I 
can agree not to cooperate, which is going to put me at — 
well—now you can use the second-degree felony against me. 
Or you can help and work with it and maybe get myself some 
slack.... 
FRICK: We're still talkin' here. What would the odds be of you 
contacting Jeff at this point? Have you had any contact with 
him at all? 
DOBBS: I have not had any contact — 
FRICK: How about with — 
DOBBS: No, none of 'em. None of 'em.... I had a phone call about 
four or five months ago, and I told my parents. Look, I swear 
to you I'm not anywhere—like, no connection with him at 
all. That's why I pretty much got my number changed. I have 
not made any communication with him. It stopped.

to Jeff? Or can we just kinda show up and, you know, have 
you make a call as we're standing outside and say: Hey, you

FRICK: Well, you're—And here's the other thing: If you cooper-
ate and if we can—If you cooperate, whether we pull it off or 
not— that's not up to you, that's up to us, okay? So what we 
would do is if we ended up charging you with like a misde-
meanor, we'd give you a call, we'd say: Hey, you gotta come 
in, you know. 
RECAREY: You sign it.... 
FRICK: That's our preference. You come in, you've been very

we can drop you off at the end of the block if you'd like. Or 
we can cushion the blow beyond what—but again, you're 
helping us at this point. We've been pretty forthright with 
you on what is going on, our options for your future. And 
what we'd like you to do obviously is make a couple of calls 
with us this evening to talk to a couple of your, you know,

CHAPTER IS 
Michael Reiter: October 3, 2005 
Chief Reiter sifts through the evidence: information about 
underage girls—six of them—whom Wendy Dobbs pro-
cured for Epstein. Phone numbers pulled from the trash 
on El Brillo. An arrest report for Alison, the girl who'd been 
caught with a dime bag of weed. 
She'd told Detective Recarey about an encounter that sounded 
very much like a rape. 
Soon Reiter will ask a judge for a warrant. But not yet. There's 
more footwork to do, and Reiter calls Detective Joe Recarey into 
his office. 
Later that day, Detective Recarey and Sergeant George Frick 
arrive at the home of a girl named Jenny.* An older woman greets

them at the front door and invites them inside. She introduces 
them to her husband and daughter. Jenny is sixteen years old. 
Sitting down at the dining room table, they see that she's ner-
vous. In between biting her lip and fidgeting, she tells them that 
yes, she's been to Jeffrey Epstein's house. 
Wendy took her there once. But nothing much happened. 
She met Epstein's chef and spent some time in the kitchen is all. 
Then she left. 
I get what you're asking, she says. But really, I just want to 
put the whole thing behind me. 
Okay, the officers tell her. You have our numbers. But 
Jenny, if you remember anything else, you'll find that we're very 
good listeners. 
One down. Five to go. 
Detective Recarey and Detective Michael Dawson have better 
luck the next day with Francine, a girl who tells them that a year 
earlier, Wendy Dobbs—someone she knew from high school—
drove her to the house on El Brillo Way. 
Francine would have been seventeen at the time. 
Now she's willing to make a sworn statement. The officers 
noted: 
She was told she could make money working for Jeff. She was 
told she would have to provide a massage for Jeff. . She was 
brought to the kitchen area by (Dobbs]. They met with the 
house chef who was already in the Kitchen area. Francine 
stated [Wendy] would wait for her in the kitchen.

Just as she did with Mary, a woman named Sarah had taken 
Francine upstairs and into a bedroom. Then Epstein had entered 
the room, wearing only a towel. 
She kept her clothes on during the massage. She advised 
sometime during the massage, Epstein grabbed her buttocks 
and pulled her close to him. Francine said she was [made] 
uncomfortable by the incident involving Jeff. At the conclu-
sion of the massage she was paid $200.00 for the massage. 
Do you have any formal training in massages? the offi-
cers ask. 
No, says Francine. 
But she does have one more thing to tell them. 
Sarah's been calling Francine's cell phone. 
It could mean any number of things. The police know already 
that Epstein's caught wind of their investigation. Now it appears 
he's doing something about it, or at least he's delegating the 
responsibility. This troubles the cops. But then, on that same 
day, they get one more break: Jenny calls and says that without 
her parents around she's willing to make a sworn statement. 
It turns out that Jenny's visited with Epstein several times. 
And, it turns out, she'd done much more than sit in the 
kitchen. Without her parents around, she's much more willing to 
talk about it. 
The first time she'd gone to the house on El Brill° Way, she 
says, Epstein had tried to take off her shirt. She'd become upset, 
69 
JAMES PATTERSON 
and this had led to a fight— a verbal disagreement —with 
Epstein. • 
She'd left without getting paid. Gone down to the kitchen 
and told Wendy, Let's go! 
If you're uncomfortable, Wendy had told her, tell him to 
stop, and he will. 
On the other hand, Wendy had also told her, The more you 
do, the more you get paid. 
A few weeks later, she agreed to return to the house on El 
Brillo. 
Once again Sarah had taken Jenny upstairs and into the mas-
ter bedroom. Sarah had set up the massage table, laid out the oils 
that Jenny would use. 
Then Epstein had entered the room wearing only a towel. 
Jenny had been wearing tight jeans. She had a tight belt on. 
She kept the jeans on, though Epstein still made a grab for her 
buttocks. Then he rolled onto his back and grabbed for her 
breasts. Jenny became upset yet again. But this time, she was 
paid two hundred dollars before leaving. She never did go back 
to the house. But, like Francine, she has one more thing to tell 
the detectives. 
Another girl from her high school had been there on the day 
of her second visit with Epstein. Kristina. And later, Kristina 
told Jenny that she also had a problem with Epstein. 
Girls seemed to be turning up all the time. And the detec-
tives were just getting started. 
One girl leads Chief Reiter's team to another. And every time, 
they hear the same story. The girls are approached by Wendy

the kitchen—maybe some milk and cereal, if they feel hungry—
they're walked upstairs. Epstein's there, waiting, wearing his 
towel. Sometimes with a vibrator. Sometimes the girls recom-
mend their friends, and for this they receive a commission. 
None of the girls comes from money. And none of them has 
been trained as a masseuse. Then again, how could they be? To

Cynthia: October 6, 2005 
Three days after meeting with Francine, the police drive to 
Boca Raton. They're there to see Cynthia Selleck, who's 
eighteen years old.* But according to the probable-cause 
affidavit that the Palm Beach PD is preparing in order to obtain 
an arrest warrant for Epstein, Cynthia was sixteen when Wendy 
Dobbs first took her to meet him. 
During a sworn taped statement, she tells the police that 
she'd met Wendy at her high school. She says that Wendy had 
recruited her and prepped her for her first visit to Epstein's 
house. And she says she'd ended up going to the house a lot of 
times to provide massages over the past two years. The affidavit

Alison: October ii, 2005 
After speaking with Cynthia, Detectives Recarey and Daw-
son meet up, once again, with Alison. It's been exactly one 
month since her arrest, and once again, she's willing to talk. 
They have no trouble obtaining her sworn taped statement. 
Alison is eighteen, but she's been going to Epstein's house 
since 2002. Things got off to a slow start, she says. She received 
two hundred dollars for her first session, during which she had 
her bra off but her underwear on. Still, at the end of the session, 
Epstein had asked for her number. 
Then the sessions got heavier. Much heavier, as Detective Recarey 
already knew. [Alison] stated that during her many visits a routine was 
established between her and Epstein, he wrote in his report. 
She would enter the house and get naked in the bedroom. She 
would then start with a back massage. Epstein would roll on

stated Epstein would then begin to masturbate himself and at 
the same time would insert his fingers in her vagina and 
masturbate her with his fingers. 
[Alison] explained Epstein would continue this process 
until he ejaculated. He would then utilize a vibrator/mas-
sager on her vagina until [Alison] climaxed. [Alison] advised 
that during her frequent visits, Epstein asked for her real 
age, [and Alison] stated she was sixteen. Epstein advised her 
not to tell anyone her real age. [Alison] advised that things 
escalated within the home as Epstein would instruct and pay 
[Alison] to have intercourse with his female friend, Nada 
Marcinkova [sic]. [Alison] explained the intercourse included 
using strap on dildos, large rubber penisIsic] and other 
devices that Epstein had at his disposal. Epstein would watch 
them have intercourse and masturbate himself. Occasion-
ally, Epstein would then join in during the female on female 
intercourse and provide oral sex to both [Alison] and Mar-
cinkova. This occurred during the time [Alison] was sixteen 
years of age. 
[Alison] advised this continued to escalate during two 
years. The routine became familiar to [Alison]. Epstein's 
assistant Sarah would telephone her every time Epstein was 
in the Town of Palm Beach and would place appointments 
for her to visit and work for Epstein. Each time something 
new was introduced, additional monies were produced and 
offered for [Alison] to allow the acts to happen. [Alison] con-
sented to perform all these acts but was adamant that there 
was an understanding with Epstein that no vaginal penetra-
tion would occur with his penis. [Alison] explained that 
75 
JAMES PATTERSON 
Epstein's penis was deformed. [She] explained that his penis 
was oval shaped. [She] claimed when Epstein's penis was 
erect, it was thick toward the bottom but was thin and small 
toward the head portion. [She] called Epstein's penis 
egg-shaped. [She] stated Epstein would photograph Mar-
cinkova and her naked and having sex and proudly display 
the photographs within the home. [Alison] stated during one 
visit to Epstein's house in which she provided a massage to 
Epstein, his female friend, Nada [sic] Marcinkova, was also 
present. [Alison] provided the massage in which Marcinkova 
and her would fondle each other's breasts and kiss for Epstein 
to enjoy. Towards the end of this massage, Epstein grabbed 
[Alison] and turned her over onto her stomach on the mas-
sage table and forcibly inserted his penis into her vagina: 
[Alison] stated Epstein began to pump his penis in her 
vagina. [She] became upset over this. She said her head was 
being held against the table forcibly, as he continued to pump 
inside her. She screamed No! and Epstein stopped. She told 
him that she did not want to have his penis inside of her. 
Epstein did not ejaculate inside of her and apologized for his 
actions and subsequently paid her a thousand dollars for 
that visit. [Alison] stated she knows he still displays her pho-
tographs through out the house. 
What happened to Mary had been bad enough. But what hap-
pened to Alison was on a whole other level. She'd been caught 
with some pot, sure. But that was hardly a felony offense. It didn't 
make her a liar. And, in important respects, Alison's statement 
had aligned with Mary's and with statements they'd been given

Probably not. Almost certainly not. But again, what she said was

Detective Recarey and his team had done exceptional work 
on the investigation that Officer Pagan had started. 
It was enough, Reiter decided, to cause a judge to issue a 
search warrant. 
77 
CHAPTER 18 
Michael Reiter: October 2005 
0 n October 20, Palm Beach police officers execute a search 
warrant, signed by Judge Laura Johnson, at Jeffrey Epstein's 
home on El Brillo Way. Inside the house, an employee is 
on the phone with Epstein. They ask him, politely, to hang up. 
Then, guns drawn, they walk up the winding stairs to the home's 
second story. 
Detective Recarey remains outside and reads the warrant, out 
loud, to Epstein's houseman while another officer videotapes them. 
This is your copy, Recarey says as he hands over the war-
rant. When we are concluded, I will leave a list of what items 
we've taken, okay? I would ask that you don't answer your tele-
phone. I know that the gentleman was having a conversation 
with Mr. Epstein at the time. So I'm sure he's trying to call and 
find out what's going on. He will be told what was going on as 
soon as we're done. Okay?

Inside the house, detectives see the pink-and-green couch 
that Mary and other girls had described. They see photos of 
naked young girls—in some cases, girls they've spoken to about 
Epstein. They also find message pads on which are written first 
names, dates, and numbers for the girls. 
Sometimes there are notes to go with the names and num-
bers: I have girls for him. Or I have 2 girls for him. 
These notes are signed by one Sarah Kellen. 
Epstein's house has a strangely antiseptic quality. Some of 
the bedrooms look almost like doctors' offices. In the bathroom 
off Epstein's bedroom, there's a massage table as well as stands 
holding strange machines, which looked like something you'd 
find in a dermatologist's office. 
In a wood-colored armoire beside Epstein's bed, they see a 
bottle of peach-flavored Joy Jelly. In the bathroom, there are 
soaps shaped like penises and vaginas, bottles of Mango Mist, 
more Joy Jelly, and boxes of tampons. 
The officers find stacks of UFC videos and DVDs of Rock Star 
and other B-list movies. 
They also find receipts for books bought on Amazon, such as 
SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for Erotic Servitude. 
On the first floor, detectives are drawn to two secret cameras 
hidden in clocks. On the computer hard drive, they see several 
photographs of Wendy and other girls. These images appear to 
come from the camera inside the clock behind Epstein's desk. 
The officers know where the cameras are because they helped 
install them—in 2004, when Epstein complained that someone 
had stolen a gun and $2,700 from him. Detective Recarey had 
investigated that case. But before he could arrest Epstein's handy-
man, Juan Alessi, for the theft, Epstein contacted a captain in the 
79 
JAMES PATTERSON 
Palm Beach PD and prevailed upon him to have the investigation 
called off. 
Epstein had met Alessi at a luncheonette, he explained, and 
Alessi had agreed to pay back the money. At the time, it made no 
sense to prosecute: Epstein was a busy man. He was going to get 
his money. But he did invite the police into his home to install 
the cameras. This was a service that the Palm Beach PD provided 
(though Epstein would be the only one with access to the foot-
age). But while they were there, the police had noticed a group of 
attractive young women who seemed to be camped out at the 
house. 
The group included Sarah Kellen and Nadia Marcinkova. 
None of the girls was a relative of Epstein— that fact had 
caught the cops' attention. 
And now, as the search continues, the cops see photographs 
of the very same girls. 
On Epstein's desk, the officers find Alison's high school 
transcript. 
The thing is, the detectives can't shake the feeling that the 
Epstein house has been tidied up for their arrival. Shelves look 
as though they've been emptied, and several photographs appear 
to have been removed from the walls. 
[Judging] by the condition of the place to be searched, 
Chief Reiter will say in his deposition for B.B. vs. Epstein, some-
one probably had cleaned it up a bit. 
Maybe there's nothing too surprising about this. After all, 
Reiter's team knows that Epstein's gotten wind of their investiga-
tion. What is surprising is that for a house that's been scrubbed, 
there's so much left lying around. 
In fact, the oddest thing about the search is that someone,*

about the search is that someone 
80 
appears to have gone through the house, gotten rid of incrimi-
nating materials, but left many clues behind. 
It was as if the things the police were seeing didn't even reg-
ister as wrong. 
There's another feeling the cops can't shake: the nagging sense 
that they themselves are being investigated and tailed. 
First Reiter hears through the grapevine that Epstein's law-
yers have hired private investigators to perform background 
checks. 
A public-records demand has been filed in an effort to obtain 
Reiter's own records. 
Detective Recarey tells Reiter that he, too, is being surveilled 
and that his trash has been picked through. 
In his entire career as a police officer, this is the first time 
that Reiter's seen or heard of such a thing: a suspect investigat-
ing his investigators. But for the moment, he puts it aside. Recar-
ey's doing great work on the investigation. He's deeply invested, 
and for good reason: the detective's got four kids of his own. 
Right now, more victims are coming out of the woodwork. And 
now that the warrant's been executed, there's no downside to 
interviewing Epstein's servants.

Detective Recarey, Probable-Cause Affidavit: 
May 2006 
On November 21, 2005 I interviewed Jose [sic] Alessi, a for-
mer houseman for Jeffrey Epstein. Alessi stated he was 
employed for eleven years with Mr. Epstein, from approxi-
mately 1993 through 2004. Alessi stated he was the house 
manager, driver and house maintenance person. It was his 
responsibility to prepare the house for Epstein's arrival. 
When asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they 
traveled with Epstein on his private plane. I asked Mr. Alessi 
about the massages that have occurred at. Epstein's home. 
Alessi stated Epstein receives three massages a day. Each 
masseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated 
that towards the end of his employment, the masseuses were 
younger and younger. When asked how young, Mr. Alessi

at the most. The massages would occur in Epstein's bedroom 
or bathroom. He knew this because he often set up the mas-
sage tables. I asked if there were things going on other than a 
massage. Alessi stated that there were times towards the end 
of his employment that he would have to wash off a mas-
sager/vibrator and a long rubber penis, which were in the 
sink after the massage. Additionally, he stated the bed would 
almost always have to be made after the massage. 
On January 4, 2006 I interviewed another former house-
man, Mr. Alfredo Rodriguez. During a sworn taped state-
ment, Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed by Jeffrey 
Epstein for approximately six months, from November 2004 
through May of 2005. His responsibilities as house manager 
included being the butler, chauffeur, chef, houseman [and to] 
run errands for Epstein and provide for Epstein's guests. I 
asked Rodriguez about masseuses corning to the house. 
Rodriguez stated Epstein would have two massages a day. 
Epstein would have one massage in the morning and one 
massage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence. 
Rodriguez stated he would be informed to expect someone 
and make them comfortable until either Sarah Kellen- or 
Epstein would meet with them. Rodriguez stated once the 
masseuses would arrive, he would allow them entry into the 
kitchen area and offer them something to drink or eat. They 
would then be encountered by either Sarah Kellen or Epstein. 
They would be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked 
Rodriguez if any of the masseuses appeared young in age. 
Rodriguez stated the girls that would come appeared to be 
too young to be masseuses. He stated one time under Epstein's 
direction, he delivered a dozen roses to [Mary's high school] 
83 
JAMES PATTERSON 
for one of the girls that came to provide a massage. He knew 
the girls were still in high school and were of high school age. 
I asked Rodriguez about the massages. He felt there was a lot 
more going on than just massages. 
He would often clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the 
alleged massages and would discover massagers/vibrators 
and sex toys scattered on the floor. He also said he would 
wipe down the vibrators and sex toys and put them away in 
an armoire. He described the armoire as a small wood 
armoire which was on the wall close to Epstein's bed. On one 
occasion Epstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollar rent a 
car and rent a car for the same girl he brought the roses to, so 
that she could drive her self to Epstein's house without inci-
dent. Rodriguez said the girl always needed rides to and 
from the house. 
Rodriguez produced a green folder which contained doc-
uments, and a note with Mr. Epstein's stationery with direc-
tion to deliver a bucket of roses to (Mary's] High School after 
fa] high school drama performance. . . . 
During the course of the investigation, subpoenas were 
obtained for cell phone and home phone records from several 
victims and witnesses along with the cell phone records of 
Sarah Kellen. An analysis of these records was conducted 
which found numerous telephone calls were made between 
Sarah Kellen and the victims. These records indicate the 
dates the calls were made are consistent with the dates and 
times the victims/witnesses stated they were contacted. Spe-
cifically, the phone records showed Kellen called [Wendy 
Dobbs] during the exact times and dates when [name

Pursuant to a lawful subpoena I obtained Epstein's pri-

records show arrival and departure of Epstein's plane at 
Palm Beach International airport. These records were com-
pared to the cell phone records of Sarah Kellen. This compar-
ison found that all the phone calls Kellen made to [Dobbs] 
and the victims were made in the days just prior to their 
arrival or during the time Epstein was in Palm Beach. 
Therefore, as Jeffrey Epstein, who at the time of these 
incidents was fifty one years of age, did have vaginal inter-
course either with his penis or digitally with [names

is sufficient probable cause to charge Jeffrey Epstein with

ony. As Epstein, who at the time of the incident was fifty two 
years of age, did use a vibrator on the external vaginal area 
of [name redacted], a fourteen year old minor, there is suffi-
cient probable cause to charge him with Lewd and Lascivi-
ous Molestation, in violation of Florida State Statute 800.04

Hi 
I'm a reporter at CNN, and my colleague Blake Ellis and I have read that Bill Clinton and Donald 
Trump have both visited Epstein's private island. We are trying to determine whether there is any 
truth to the allegations that either or both of these men may have had sexual relations with minors 
while there. We know that you have been Epstein's pilot, so we're wondering if you would be willing 
to speak with us completely off the record. We are not focusing on the allegations against Epstein --
we are solely focusing on Trump and Clinton given the current allegations being levied in the press.

3) Sentiment on growth: Also bullish

• Gross max payoff if knock-in is triggered: 2.8x (5.0%/1.75%) 
• Gross max payoff if knock-in is not triggered: 5.6x (9.9%/1.75%) — you have upside up to 114.9%

Subject: Financials: buy XLF call spreads 
Underweight positioning, buybacks resuming, positive momentum and strong fundamentals all indicate that there is 
still further upside potential in financials (more details below). Our financials sector specialist thinks XLF could have 
another 20-25% upside given the many levers to the Trump Trade: less regulation, higher interest rates, higher vol, 
economic growth, loan growth, etc. The asset sensitive regional banks are more of a pure play on a rates move but we 
view the larger cap banks as having multi-pronged upside given the aforementioned points. 
That said, given the velocity and magnitude of the recent move and uncertainty around the impact and timing of 
Trump's policies, we believe options offer better risk-reward than being outright long financials stocks here. With flat 
call skew, appearing call spreads with upside knock-ins price well. 
Buy a 1 year XLF call spread for 2.6% premium 
• Buy a 110% call 
• Sell a 117.5% call with an at-expiry knock-in at 125% (call is not active unless XLF is 125% or higher at expiry) 
o Total premium is 2.6% 
o Gross max payoff if knock-in is triggered: 2.9x (7.5%/2.6%) 
o Gross max payoff if knock-in is not triggered: 5.7x (14.9%/2.6%) — you have upside up to 124.9% 
Post Election Flow Skews - Buyers of Health Care (via ETFs) and Financials (mainly ETFs) 
• US Buyback Flows 
• Cons Disc, Technology and Financials are the largest 3 sectors for US buybacks (over 70% of execution). We 
are seeing a seasonal increase in buybacks as we come out of the low seasonal month of the year (October) and should 
see increased buyback executions until year-end, another source of upside for the Cons Disc, Technology and Financials  
sectors.

sector and are UW this sector in all regions. 
Future of Financials conference hosted 90 public and private companies at our Future of Financials conference. We are 
raising our price objectives across most of our names. Three primary reasons why we think there is upside remaining 
after the recent rally: 1) an improved outlook on both activity levels and interest rates, driving revenue upside; 2) 
potentially lower regulatory burden, particularly as new supervisory leadership can come with the new administration; 
and 3) relatively lighter positioning in US financials vs. other sectors. (Erika Najarian)

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023081.txt,"This policy would effectively result in the tax authorities recognizing all sales that take
place in the US (regardless of where they are produced) and all the domestic costs
incurred to produce goods and services for customers (regardless of where the sale
takes place). As a result, net importers (such as many retailers) would suffer, as they
would have to pay taxes on their domestic sales without being able to deduct a
significant portion of their costs of production. Conversely, net exporters (companies
with much of their production in the US but sales outside of the US) would stand to
benefit from not having to pay taxes on their foreign sales while being able to deduct a
significant proportion of production costs (Exhibit 3). Purely domestic companies would
be unaffected.

Even if border adjustments are enacted, there is significant uncertainty around
implementation details. For this analysis, we focus on the first order impact of border
adjustments, but we recognize there would be significant second order impacts on the
pricing of products, pricing within the supply chain, foreign exchange rates as well as
foreign policy reactions. (We discuss many of these second order impacts later in this
report.) For the current exercise, we also ignored the cost of services as the
implementation of these rules would be more complicated. See the Methodology
section for more details.

We estimate that at a 20% tax rate, border adjustments would detract $5-6 from 2018
EPS, with nearly 80% of the drag coming from the Consumer Discretionary and
Consumer Staples sectors (roughly evenly split). This impact includes a 50% haircut to
account for offsets from alternate sourcing, currency rates and pricing power. On one
hand, we may be drastically underestimating the impact because we have not included
the second order impacts on the supply chain. For example, many retailers source the
bulk of their goods from domestic suppliers, who source their goods from overseas
suppliers. So while the original retailer may not feel the direct tax hit from importing
goods, the supplier that took the tax hit would likely pass along a significant portion of
this via a higher cost. On the other hand, the supplier or the retailer could look for
alternate domestic sources for those products, but it would largely depend on whether
the cost differential of production between the US and overseas exceeded the border
adjustment tax. Some key components in determining the cost differential are the
foreign exchange rates (more on this below) and labor costs. In the end, the net impact
of the border adjustment taxes will be driven by a complex interplay between corporate
tax rates, pricing power, foreign exchange moves, foreign versus domestic availability
and cost differentials.

of study? What secret had he penetrated? What sort of education had he finally
received at the end of his humiliations and breakthroughs? He had mastered the
energy of his age - and the exact right sensibility to use it. Might we, Nan seemed to
be asking, do the same?

7.

Faced with the mad unsettling of his world during the Industrial Revolution of the
mid 19 century, the German philosopher Friederich Nietzsche once mused that
survival and greatness would depend on having what he called a “Sixth Sense”, by
which he meant a feeling for history. Surely, he felt, an instinct for ancient balances
and truths would provide a guide rail of sorts as the world lurched into a new age,
along an uncharted road.? If you could say “This has happened before” or “This is
how we got to where we are,” Nietzsche believed, it was the first step towards
knowing where to go next. Nan and Kissinger knew the need for something else for
our age as well, for a different instinct. It wasn’t just about knowing your history or
feeling the real possibility of human progress or tragedy. Rather it was about feeling
out the roots of the present in a certain way. All of our ideas - from how we love to
what we think of politics - are taken from the feedback and experience of our lives,
from what we've seen and done and felt and learned. We are the sum total of our
experiences, in this sense. But what to do if changes happen at some deeper,
insensible level where the old ideas and instincts, where the tools of sight and smell,
of feel and taste and hearing don’t fully answer? What to do when we are confronted
with what we've never experienced before? Never even dreamed of, perhaps?

This book is the story of a completely fresh way of feeling our world. By this I mean
a sensation that is as newborn as the lively sense of connection, of freedom, of
electric uncertainty and hope that come with the knowledge that we are unboxing a
new age. If Nietzsche’s era demanded a feeling for history, our own age insists ona

3 Surely, he felt: Nietzche describes the “Sixth Sense” in Beyond Good and Evil in the
following way: “The historical sense (or the capacity for divining quickly the order
of rank of the evaluations according to which a people, a society, a human being has
lived, the ‘divinatory instinct’ for the relationships of these evaluations, for the
relation of the authority of values to the authority of effective forces): this historical
sense, to which we Europeans lay claim as our specialty, has come to us in the wake
of the mad and fascinating semi-barbarism into which Europe has been plunged
through the democratic mingling of classes and races—only the nineteenth century
knows this sense, as its sixth sense. The past of every form and mode of life, of
cultures that formerly lay close beside or on top of one another, streams into us
“modern souls” thanks to this mingling, our instincts now run back in all directions,
we ourselves are a kind of chaos. In the end, as I said before, ‘the spirit’ perceives its
advantage in all this.” See Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche and Rolf Horstmann. Beyond
Good and Evil Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future, (Cambridge: Cambridge
University Press, 2002), 224.

lately become —despite, perhaps even because of, the frequency and promiscuousness of its
invocation — little more than a caricature of logical argumentation. From the beginning of my
career as a First Amendment lawyer, I have taken aim at this analogy, both in my writings and in
my cases. In my view, it is one of the least persuasive, though most influential, arguments for
censorship that ever came from anyone’s pen!

The case that gave rise to the “Fire!’”’-in-a-crowded-theater analogy— Schenck v. United States—
involved the prosecution of Charles Schenck, who was the general secretary of the Socialist Party
in Philadelphia. In 1917 a jury found Schenck guilty of attempting to cause insubordination
among soldiers who had been drafted to fight in the First World War. He had circulated leaflets
urging draftees not to “submit to intimidation” by fighting in a war being conducted on behalf of
“Wall Street’s chosen few.” Schenck admitted that the intent of the pamphlet’s “impassioned
language” was to “influence” draftees to resist the draft. Nothing in the pamphlet suggested that
the draftees should use unlawful or violent means to oppose conscription. As Justice Holmes
found: “In form at least [the pamphlet] confined itself to peaceful measures, such as a petition for
the repeal of the act” and an exhortation to exercise “your right to assert your opposition to the
draft.” Many of the pamphlet’s words were quoted directly from the Constitution. It would hard
to . Aclear case of petitioning one’s government for a redress of grievances, which is
explicitly protected by the worlds of the First Amendment.

Holmes also acknowledged that “in many places and in ordinary times the defendants, in saying all
that was said in the circular, would have been within their constitutional rights.” “But,” he added,
“the character of every act depends upon the circumstances in which it is

done.” And to illustrate that truism he went on to say, “The most stringent protection of free
speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theater, and causing a panic.”

Justice Holmes upheld the convictions, finding that the pamphlet created “a clear and present
danger” of hindering the war effort while our soldiers were fighting for their lives and our liberty.

The example of shouting “Fire!” obviously bore little relationship to the facts of the Schenck case.
The Schenck pamphlet contained a political message—a series of ideas and arguments. It urged
its draftee readers to think about the message and then — if they so chose — to act on it ina
lawful and nonviolent way. The man who shouts “Fire!” in a theater is neither sending a political
message nor inviting his listener to think about what he has said and decide what to do in a
rational, calculated manner. On the contrary, the message is designed to force action without
contemplation. The shout of “Fire!” is directed not to the mind and the conscience of the listener
but, rather, to his adrenaline and his feet. It is a stimulus to immediate action, not thoughtful
reflection.

> The core analogy is the nonverbal alarm, and the derivative example is the verbal shout. By cleverly substituting
the derivative shout for the core alarm, Holmes made it possible to analogize one set of words to another—as he

V: In a roundabout way, yes. In so many ways, Jeffrey really really had to train me, and that
was why Ghislaine said that she and Jeffrey enjoyed me so much was because they never
really had to speak much to me to tell me what they wanted me to do. You know, I
wasn’t waiting for you know, their directions. Jeffrey would tell me to go give an erotic
massage to friends. He wouldn’t give me much detail about it, but he would say to treat
them like you treat me.

JS: Did he refer to it as an erotic massage or are those your words?

V: Erotic massage is my words. That’s exactly what it was, but he would tell me to treat
them how he wanted it, so I'd do what he wanted without having to say to me words
more. I mean, I complied with what he wanted because it was somewhat of a, I don’t
know, I don’t know how to say it, it was just very mindboggling how I let him have so
much control or power over me basically. The massages would be routine to what Jeffrey
wanted with my so called new clientele, and with their own words would ask me to
provide them with sexual pleasure after the massage.

JS: Did you ever report back to Jeffrey about what happened when you provided massages to
his friends?

V: Of course, of course, and I knew that his friends were reporting back to him as well
because there were times where he would instigate conversation by saying you know, so
and so had a great time, you did wonderful, you know so and so gave me a call and told
J.E how it went_...

JS: Did Jeffrey ever elicit details from you? “Tell me what happened, describe in detail what
went on?”

V: No, but he would have a laugh, he had a laugh with me a few times about some of their
different mannerisms, I guess you would say, like some of them, one guy had a foot
fetish and that was really weird and I mentioned it to Jeffrey, and we would have a laugh
over it. He didn’t want to know details. He wasn’t asking me “so tell me what did you
guys do exactly.” No, he just basically gave me a slap on the back and said, you know,
good job. And we had some kind of conversation about it. I can’t recall any conversation
off the top of my head. I really don’t know one. It’s been that long. But yeah, we did
talk about it briefly.

handling of the economy.

The share of Americans who believe the stimulus package will restore the economy slipped to 52 percent in late June, down from 59
percent two months earlier, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll.

Vice President Joe Biden said the administration had misread how bad the economy was when it took office but that the stimulus
package would help the economy recovery and create jobs.

Senate Republican Leader Mich McConnell Friday called the stimulus plan a failure.

Obama said it takes time for the plan's money to get out the door to pay for roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects that will
create jobs because we are committed to spending it in a way that is effective and transparent.

But both Olmert and Tzipi soon fell prey to the same self-defeating temptation
that had worried me during the meandering war against Hizbollah. Our ground
incursion began a few days into the operation. The intention was to stay for a few
more days and then, responding to inevitable international appeals, call a halt to a
campaign that had already achieved nearly all of its targets. Perhaps wanting to
balance the failures in Lebanon there with “success” in Gaza, Olmert wanted us to
continue, and expand our attacks deeper into Gaza. I reminded him that we’d
agreed the aims beforehand. The longer we stayed, the less clear any gains would
be. Yes, our ground forces had so far faced virtually no resistance or casualties.
“But that’s because we’re outside the main populated areas,” I said. “The deeper
we get in, the better it will be for Hamas. They gain simply by surviving, like
Hizbollah.” Yet Olmert kept insisting that we’d succeeded so far, so let’s not stop.

It wasn’t until January 17, three weeks after the operation began, that we
announced a cease-fire. Militarily, the operation was a success. While Hamas
launched nearly 3,000 rockets into Israel in the year before our attack, there were
only 300 in the year that followed. But politically and diplomatically, the extra
week reduced, rather than helped, the chances of reaching an understanding for a
longer-term reduction of the attacks. To the extent there was any political gain, it
was to burnish Tzipi Livni’s credentials as a tough potential Prime Minister ahead
of the election. That was not her intent. Of all the politicians I’ve known, she is
among the least interested in such games, especially with lives at stake. But it was
one of the effects.

She won the election, in a photo finish, with opinion polls suggesting she’d
been effective in shaping the campaign as a choice “between Tzipi and Bibi.”
Kadima got 28 Knesset seats, to 27 for Bibi and the Likud, which gave her the first
crack at forming a government. There’s no way of disguising the fact that Labor’s
result in my first election back in charge was a disappointment. We went down six
seats, to 13. The big gainer was a far-right, stridently anti-Arab party called Yisrael
Beitenu, led by a former Likudnik named Avigdor Lieberman. Tzipi’s attempt to
form a coalition became less a political process than a contest between rival stalls
in a Middle Eastern bazaar. Bibi was holding parallel talks with the Orthodox
parties critical to assembling a parliamentary majority. He was matching and
raising every assurance of a ministerial seat or budgetary concession that Tzipi was
prepared to offer. In the end, she threw up her hands, saying she refused to draw
out a process which was not so much a negotiation as organized extortion. I am

quickly uncovering his true identity. He was listed by his true name
on the roster of the U.S. mission to the UN. By consulting personnel
records, one would further discover that he did not actually work for
the State Department. Because it was no secret that the U.S. mission
in Geneva housed the CIA station for all of Switzerland, any out-
sider would think it probable that this brittle gambler who played
the options market worked for the CIA.

Even though it cannot be precluded that Snowden was spotted
in Geneva by another intelligence service, there is no evidence, at
least that I know of, to suggest that he was approached by one. Nor
is there reason to believe that if he had been contacted by a for-
eign service in 2008, he would have responded positively. Despite
his indiscreet posting about his outside activities, he apparently still
respected the boundaries of secrecy that had been clearly defined in
the oath he had taken at the CIA. For example, after The New York
Times published an article revealing secret American intelligence
activities in Iran on January 11, 2009, Snowden railed against the
newspaper on the Internet under his TrueHooHa alias. He wrote,

© “This shit is classified for a reason.... It’s because this shit won't ®
work if Iran knows what we are doing.” He clearly recognized that
revealing intelligence sources was extremely damaging. As for the
Times, he said, “Hopefully they’Il finally go bankrupt this year.”
When another Internet user asked him if it was unethical to release
national security secrets, he answered, “ YEEEEEEEEEES.”

As with every CIA officer, Snowden had to undergo a two-year
evaluation and take a routine polygraph test. It was then, in Decem-
ber 2008, that his superior at the CIA placed a “derog” in his file, the
CIA’s shorthand for a derogatory comment, in an unfavorable evalu-
ation. The reason remains somewhat murky. According to a New
York Times story by the veteran intelligence reporter Eric Schmitt,
Snowden’s superior had suspected that Snowden “was trying to
break into classified computer files to which he was not authorized
to have access.” Schmitt evidently had well-placed sources in the
CIA. He said that he interviewed two senior American officials who
were familiar with the case. According to what they told Schmitt, the
CIA superior had decided to “send Snowden home.” Officially, how-

clothes. In shock, fear and trepidation, Jane complied, removing her clothes except for her
underwear. Epstein then sexually assaulted Jane,

15. After Epstein had completed the assault, he left the room. Jane was then able to get
dressed, leave the room and go back down the stairs. She then met Ms. Robson again who brought
Janehome. Jane was paid $300 by Epstein. Ms. Robson was paid $200 by Epstein for bringing Jane

It began with an accident. On Tuesday, December 8, 1987, an Israeli tank
transporter crashed into a minibus carrying Palestinians from the Jabalya
refugee camp near the main crossing from Gaza into Israel. Four passengers
were killed.

By the time of the funerals the next day, a rumor had spread, no less
incendiary for being absurd, that the crash had been deliberate — retaliation for
the fatal stabbing of an Israeli man a few days earlier. Crowds of Palestinians
leaving the burials began shouting “Death to Israel!” They hurled rocks and
bottles at Israeli security patrols, and blocked streets with burning tires. By the
next day, the violence started spreading to the West Bank, and then to parts of
east Jerusalem. The headline-writers moved from the word “disturbances” to
“unrest” and finally to the Palesitnians’ own name for the most serious outbreak
of violence since 1967: the “intifada”. The uprising.

At least for the first week or two, we assumed its ferocity and scale would
subside. Our immediate aim was to contain it, and limit the human cost on both
sides. Yet when Dan and I began visiting units on the front line of this new
conflict, we realized that if it kept escalating, we’d have to find new tools and
strategies to bring it under control. We were in charge of an army trained to
equip and fight enemy soldiers. Now, we were asking teenage recruits to
operate as riot police against stone-throwing mobs. Before long, it wasn’t just
stones, or even bottles. In one incident in Gaza, a young soldier was surrounded
by a crowd of Palestinians and stabbed. He opened fire, wounding two of the
attackers. Yitzhik Mordechai, now the head of the southern command, told
reporters that his troops were under “strict orders to open fire only if their lives
are under threat.” That was true. But I couldn’t help wondering how long the
other part of his statement would hold: that we remained “in control of the
situation.”

We did fee/ in control for the first few days. Defense Minister Rabin was
away in Washington on an official visit. When his office asked us whether he
should fly back, we said there was no need. But on his return, we quickly agreed
that, as a first priority, we needed to find an alternative to live ammunition in
quelling the attacks. Otherwise, we’d be left with two equally bad options:
either simply stand aside, in order to avoid killing or injuring demonstrators; or
intervene with the inevitable casualties. But one of our most important early
discussions was about the broader aspects of the violence. The meeting, held

Chapter 6

Flacks and Friends

Did the Russian government attempt to surrepti-
tiously influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election
in Donald Trump's favor? The answer to that question
may never be definitively known. There is, neverthe-
less, a critical mass of evidence that Kremlin-allied
forces were responsible for hacking into the Dem-
ocratic National Committee's computers, stealing
millions of files, and turning the information over to
WikiLeaks, which in turn circulated it to the media.
Some may find the evidence unsatisfactory. But given
Russia's well-established record of cyberwarfare,
previously directed at neighboring states like Estonia
and Ukraine, and the Russian regime's dislike for the
Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, there is ample
reason to treat charges of Russian culpability as
strongly credible.

Another body of evidence can be found in Russia's
record of involvement in the internal politics of a
number of countries in Europe, including European
Union (EU) member states. In fact, under Vladimir
Putin, Russia has repeatedly interfered in the affairs of
European states in ways that the Kremlin would regard
as intolerable if Russia were the target.

Russian involvement is usually camouflaged so as

to ensure a degree of deniability, but the disguise is
sometimes rather thin. In late 2014, France's far-right
National Front party, led by Marine Le Pen, secured a
€9 million loan from a Russian bank with indirect ties
to the government in what many interpreted as a bet
by Putin on the future of French politics. Le Pen has
subsequently spoken favorably of Putin and criticized
the sanctions imposed on Russia by the EU.' She has
even called for a strategic alliance with Russia and
proposed a pan-European grouping that would include
Russia while leaving out the United States. By 2016, the
National Front was seeking more funding that would
enable it to participate on an equal footing with main-
stream parties in the 2017 presidential contest.

The 2014 loan came just months after the National
Front helped provide a veneer of legitimacy to Russia's
illegal annexation of Crimea. Aymeric Chauprade, a Le
Pen adviser who once called Russia “the hope of the
world against new totalitarianism,” participated in an
observer mission to monitor the Crimean referendum
on secession from Ukraine and union with Russia. The

“As an operator, but not as a human
being, | would say Putin. The way he
played the whole Syria thing. Bril-
liant.”

—Nigel Farage, on the world leader he most admires

“| admire his cool head. Because
there is a cold war being waged
against him by the EU at the behest
of the United States... | admire that

he has managed to restore pride and
contentment to a great nation that
had been humiliated and persecuted

Edwards was to fly to NY to take Maxwell’s deposition, her attorney informed Edwards that
Maxwell’s mother was deathly ill and Maxwell was consequently flying to England with no
intention of returning to the United States. Despite that assertion, Ghislaine Maxwell was in fact

schema are implicitly variables — they vary from one instance of schema execution to the next
— and may be treated as such for supercompilation purposes.

The metaprogram executes a program without assuming specific values for its input variables,
creating a tree as it goes along. Each time it reaches a statement that can have different results
depending on the values of one or more variables, it creates a new node in the tree. This part
of the supercompilation algorithm is called driving — a process which, on its own, would create
a very large tree, corresponding to a rapidly-executable but unacceptably humongous version
of the original program. In essence, driving transforms a program into a huge “decision tree”,
wherein each input to the program corresponds to a single path through the tree, from the root
to one of the leaves. As a program input travels through the tree, it is acted on by the atomic
program step living at each node. When one of the leaves is reached, the pertinent leaf node
computes the output value of the program.

The other part of supercompilation, configuration analysis, is focused on dynamically reduc-
ing the size of the tree created by driving, by recognizing patterns among the nodes of the tree
and taking steps like merging nodes together, or deleting redundant subtrees. Configuration
analysis transforms the decision tree created by driving into a decision graph, in which the
paths taken by different inputs may in some cases begin separately and then merge together.

Finally, the graph that the metaprogram creates is translated back into a program, embody-
ing the constraints implicit in the nodes of the graph. This program is not likely to look anything
like the original program that the metaprogram started with, but it is guaranteed to carry out
the same function [NOTE: Give a graphical representation of the decision graph corresponding
to the supercompiled binary search program for L=4, described above.].

18.3.2 Supercompilation for Goal-Directed Program Modification

Supercompilation, as conventionally envisioned, is about making programs run faster; and as
noted above, it will almost certainly be useful for this purpose within CogPrime.

But the process of program modeling embedded in the supercompilation process, is poten-
tially of great value beyond the quest for faster software. The decision graph representation of a
program, produced in the course of supercompilation, may be exported directly into CogPrime
as a set of logical relationships.

Essentially, each node of the supercompiler’s internal decision graph looks like:

Input: List L

PITAL Cannabis Investment Report | December 2017

routine approval procedures for drugs with extracts of high-THC cannabis varieties; and (6) canna-
bis parts and derivatives will be removed from the CSA schedules (either incrementally, starting with
CBD, or all at once) and will be fully legal for medical and recreational purposes. (We expand on these
predicted developments in Chapter IV, U.S. Legal Landscape.) We believe that federal legalization will
trigger rapid growth in the U.S. market, propelled by interstate commerce, access to the federal bank-
ing system and acceleration of the cannabis-derived pharmaceuticals market. A change in the federal
status of cannabis in the United States will not only drive U.S. market growth, but should provide a
significant catalyst to the market worldwide.

Increasing Awareness of the Medical Efficacy of Cannabis. In aggregate, across all U.S. state laws,
cannabis is legally recognized as a form of therapy or medicine for more than 50 medical conditions.
In addition, at least 20 countries have medical laws that facilitate patient access to cannabis or concen-
trates for treating specified medical conditions. We believe that countries and U.S. states will continue
to adopt and enhance legal frameworks for the medicinal use of cannabis products. In addition, we
believe that many more cannabis consumers will emerge as research on cannabis increasingly demon-
strates its medical efficacy and as more therapeutic products are developed and brought to market.

Increasing Recreational Legalization. Most laws facilitating access to cannabis, both in U.S. states
and abroad, are medical laws. However, Uruguay and eight U.S. states have enacted recreational laws
permitting the commercial production and sale of cannabis to adults for recreational and other uses
(and Canada is widely expected to do so in mid-2018). In the handful of jurisdictions that started
with medical laws and later adopted recreational laws—particularly in Colorado, Washington and
Oregon—adoption of recreational laws has led to significant growth in overall market size and a rapid
increase in the percentage of the market represented by recreational consumers. We expect 2018 will be
a watershed year for the recreational market, with the implementation of California’s new recreational
law and the expected approval and implementation of Canada’s recreational law. If these laws stimulate
demand, as expected, and are otherwise viewed as successful, we expect more U.S. states and additional
countries to follow suit with similar laws.

Broadening Range of Cannabis Consumer Products. Product innovation and advancements in can-
nabis varieties, concentrates, infused products, vaporizing technology and cannabis-derived pharma-
ceutical products will drive consumer adoption and spending. Cannabis consumer product companies
will seek to differentiate their products through marketing, distribution, packaging, selection, quality
and pricing. We believe that product differentiation and availability will be more prevalent in legal
cannabis markets and will drive consumer transition from illegal to legal markets.

Declining Prices in U.S. State-Legal Cannabis Markets. The supply of cannabis has increased con-
siderably with expanded state legalization in the United States. This increase has started to dampen
retail and wholesale prices in various markets. As prices decline, we are starting to see closer price par-
ity between state-legal and illegal markets (in the United States, cannabis is generally priced lower in
illegal markets than in state-legal markets). Lower retail prices in state-legal markets should accelerate
consumer transition from illegal to state-legal markets and drive increased overall penetration rates.
However, state and local taxes will continue to impact pricing for cannabis products in state-legal can-
nabis markets.

The UN's Mavi Marmara report and

Turkish foreign policy
Cenap Cakmak

07 September 2011 -- The long-awaited UN report on the Mavi
Marmara incident has been finally published. The report, the release
of which was postponed for a while at Israel's request, was published
by The New York Times before an official statement was made by the
relevant UN authorities. Israel is allegedly responsible for the leak of
the report.

Sources also say that shortly before the official deadline, US
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asked Turkey to agree to the
postponement of the announcement of the report to late September.
But the report was leaked, likely because it became evident that the
report supports Israel's standpoint on the incident.

The report is significant for two reasons: First, the report now serves
as a legal justification for Israel's Gaza policy, including the naval
blockade as well as the raid Israeli forces carried out against the Mavi
Marmara in May 2010. Secondly, Turkey viewed the report as a
potential major asset, fortifying its case in the international arena as it
pursues a cooling foreign policy towards Israel in connection with the
Mavi Marmara incident. Apparently, however, it is no longer useful
for Turkey to prove it has been doing the right thing. After the
publication of the report, Turkey will have to expend greater effort to
justify its stance and make its position acceptable to the world.

What does the report say? Briefly, the report confirms and supports
everything Israel has already said about the Mavi Marmara incident.

[*70]
A. THE CVRA'S PURPOSES

An analysis of the CVRA's application before prosecutors have filed charges must begin by assessing the CVRA's purposes
because any interpretation of the CVRA that is divorced from the statute's purposes would run the risk of defeating the statute's
aims. It is axiomatic that courts should give faithful meaning to the language Congress adopted in the light of the evident
legislative purpose in enacting the law in question. 4°

As discussed above, >°

one important goal of the CVRA was to keep crime victims informed about any developments in the
criminal justice process. But the need to be informed does not begin with the filing of a formal criminal charge. A crime victim
needs to know what is happening before formal charging - during a criminal investigation, for example - just as much as she
needs to know what is happening in court. Indeed, she may have a greater need to know, as she may be concerned that the

criminal who harmed her is still on the loose, posing a danger to her.

Similarly, concerning the second purpose - facilitating victim participation >!

- without a right to pre-charging involvement,
victims may be effectively shut out of the process entirely. The Epstein case provides a useful illustration of why the CVRA
must be understood to extend rights to victims prior to indictment. The prosecutors handling the investigation reached an
agreement with Epstein that barred federal prosecution of sex offenses committed against dozens of victims, including Jane
Doe Number One and Jane Doe Number Two. If CVRA rights did not extend to the negotiations surrounding the agreement,

then the victims never would have had any ability to participate in the resolution of the case. **

A construction of the CVRA that extends rights to victims before charges are filed would be entirely consistent with the
CVRA's participatory purpose. If victims have the ability to participate in a pre-charging plea bargaining process, for example,
victims can help ensure that prosecutors do not overlook anything that should be covered in the plea deal. For example, victims
might be able to obtain agreement to a no contact order or valuable restitution - points that the prosecutor might fail [*71] to
consider in crafting a plea. Similarly, allowing victims to participate early in the process avoids retraumatizing victims. Again,
as the Epstein case usefully illustrates, it may be extremely difficult for victims to discover after the fact that potential criminal
charges against a criminal who has abused them have been secretly bargained away. Jane Doe Number One and Jane Doe
Number Two, for example, were outraged when they discovered prosecutors had entered into an agreement blocking any
prosecution of sex offenses Epstein committed against them - and all without telling them. >?

In short, the purposes animating the CVRA all suggest that the Act was meant to, and should, extend rights to crime victims
before formal charges are filed.

B. THE CVRA'S PLAIN LANGUAGE

While the general purposes of the CVRA support a broad interpretation of the Act, it is important to examine whether those
purposes have been expressed in the Act's language. Without a linkage to the Act's text, the general purpose might not provide

5! See supra notes 28-29.

*2 Even the Justice Department seems to recognize this point. As a matter of policy, the Department extends to victims the right to confer
with prosecutors in situations where plea discussions occur before charges have been brought. U.S. Dep't of Justice, Office for Victims of
Crime, Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance 41-42 (2011 ed., rev. May 2012) [hereinafter Attorney General
Guidelines].

3 Without disclosing confidential attorney-client communications, this fact is readily apparent from victims’ filings in the Epstein case. See,
e.g., Jane Doe Motion, supra note 40, at 17 (stating that the victims relied on the U.S. Attorney's Office representatives to their detriment[,]
that if they knew the true facts, they would have taken steps to object to the plea agreement, and that they believed criminal prosecution to
be extremely important).

Medicare Trust Funds’ Balances + Interest Income in Fiscal Analysis

Trust funds can be useful mechanisms for monitoring the balance between
earmarked receipts and a program's spending, but they are basically an
accounting device, and their balances, even if invested in Treasury securities,
provide no resources to the government for meeting future funding commitments.
When those payments come due, the government must finance them in the
same way that it finances other commitments -- through taxes or borrowing from
the public. Thus, assessing the state of the federal government's future finances
requires measuring such commitments independently of their trust fund status or

Entitlement Spending: Funding Patterns of Some

Entitlement Programs Work Better than Others

Have Worked Relatively Well Financially:
Social Security — Has operated at close to break-even - so far - thanks to sufficient payroll
tax income from a relatively large working-age population. In fact, Social Security has
worked so well, that its surplus net income has been used to finance other government
activities such as Medicaid.
Unemployment Insurance — Has operated at close to break-even thanks to accumulated
net incomes during ‘good years’ (though expenses spiked to $123 billion / $160 billion in
2009 / 2010 from $45 billion in 2008 owing to recession).

Have Worked Relatively Poorly Financially:
Medicaid — Has operated at an average annual loss of $160 billion with, in effect, an
average net margin of -100% over past 15 years; the annual dollar loss has risen from $108
billion to $273 billion because of rising healthcare costs and expanded enrollment.

Medicare — Has operated at an average annual loss of $123 billion with, in effect, an
average net margin of -83% over past 15 years; the margin has fallen from -66% to -154%
(or -$64 billion in annual loss to -$272 billion) because of rising healthcare costs +
expanding coverage (added Part D prescription drug benefits through legislation in 2003,
rolled out in 2006).

through minority investment, by acquisition or otherwise. Examples of the emergence of such strategic
investors include Constellation Brands, Inc.’s (NYSE: STZ) approximately $190 million investment
in Canopy Growth Corporation (TSX: WEED) and the more than $400 million spent by The Scotts
Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE: SMG) to acquire soil, fertilizer, hydroponic equipment and lighting
companies that are supplying the cannabis industry. These types of transactions help support the valu-
ation levels in the industry and, to an extent, validate investors’ enthusiasm for the industry.

The stock price performance and valuations of cannabis-related companies continue to be robust,
irrespective of the aforementioned funding gap. In general, we believe that valuations in both the
public and private markets are being driven more by investors’ expectations for the future growth of
the cannabis industry than by individual company fundamentals. Similarly, especially in the over-the-
counter stock market in the United States—where most of the public cannabis-related companies are
traded—stock price fluctuations and valuations tend to be heavily influenced by the illiquidity in most
stocks and the trading strategies of those involved. Overall, we believe that the capital markets for the
cannabis industry will become more efficient and rational over time as we expect increased participa-
tion from institutional and strategic investors.

= Public Capital Markets

More than 300 cannabis-related companies are traded on one or more stock markets in the United
States, Canada and other international locations. Although these companies are publicly traded, most
are in early stages of development, have de minimis revenue and are not profitable. We use the term
“cannabis-related” to include companies that participate solely in the cannabis industry and those that
participate in the cannabis industry in addition to other industries or markets.

The ability of companies to access capital markets is dependent largely on the legal landscape
for cannabis in a particular country. For example, the capital markets in countries such as Canada,
Australia, Germany and Israel (countries that have a more permissive legal framework for cannabis)
have been receptive to cannabis-related companies, while the reception by capital markets in the United
States has been more varied.

In evaluating publicly traded companies, an investor should be cognizant of where the company is
traded, as there are significant differences across the various exchanges and markets with respect to list-
ing requirements, liquidity, independent research and types of investors. Many cannabis-related com-
panies are traded on more than one market in order to attract additional investors and facilitate trading
in multiple jurisdictions. However, we believe that it is instructive to evaluate a company based on the
primary market on which it trades (We determine a company’s primary market based on a number of
factors, including stock price history, trading volume and availability of estimates.)

In the United States, a limited number of cannabis-related companies are traded on the Nasdaq
Stock Market (Nasdaq), the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NYSE American (NYSE
American), the NYSE’s market for small to mid-size capitalization companies. In addition, more than
200 cannabis-related companies are traded on the over-the-counter stock market (OTC). Nasdaq and

recognized with respect to such securities. While the General Partner will take these factors into
consideration in making investment decisions for the Fund and intends to manage the Fund ina
manner to minimize exposure to the foregoing risks, there can be no assurance that the General
Partner will be able to evaluate the risks accurately or that adverse developments with respect
to such risks will not adversely affect the value or realization of investments that are held by the
Fund in certain countries.

Reserves

As is customary in the industry, the General Partner may establish reserves for follow-on
investments by the Fund in portfolio companies, operating expenses (including the
Management Fee), Fund liabilities, and other matters. Estimating the appropriate amount of
such reserves is difficult, especially for follow-on investment opportunities, which are directly
tied to the success and capital needs of portfolio companies. Inadequate or excessive reserves
could impair the investment returns to the Limited Partners. If reserves are inadequate, the
Fund may be unable to take advantage of attractive follow-on or other investment opportunities
or to protect its existing investments from dilutive or other punitive terms associated with “pay-
to-play” or similar provisions. If reserves are excessive, the Fund may decline attractive
investment opportunities or hold unnecessary amounts of capital in money market or similar
low-yield accounts.

Diverse Investors

The Limited Partners may have conflicting investment, tax, and other interests with respect to
their investments in the Fund. The conflicting interests of individual Limited Partners may
relate to or arise from, among other things, the nature of investments made by the Fund, the
structuring or the acquisition of investments and the timing of disposition of investments. As a
consequence, conflicts of interest may arise in connection with decisions made by the Fund
Managers, including with respect to the nature or structuring of investments that may be more
beneficial for some Limited Partners than for others, particularly with respect to investors’
individual tax situations. In selecting and structuring investments appropriate for the Fund, the
General Partner will consider the investment and tax objective of the Fund and the Partners as a
whole, not the investment, tax or other objective of any Limited Partner individually.

Failure of Limited Partners to Fulfill Their Commitment Obligations

The Fund’s investments in portfolio companies will require capital calls on Limited Partners
over an extended period of time. Failure by a Limited Partner to meet a capital call could result
in the failure of the Fund to make desired investments, which could have adverse consequences
for the Fund and thus all of the Limited Partners. The failure by the Fund to receive a
significant portion of capital contributions due from Limited Partners in respect of their
Commitments could materially impair the Fund’s ability to realize its financial objectives. In
the event that a Limited Partner defaults, such Limited Partner may be subject to various
penalties, including forfeiture of all or a portion of its interest in the Fund, as provided in the
Partnership Agreement.

Risk of Dilution
Limited Partners subscribing for interests at subsequent closings will participate in existing

investments of the Fund, diluting the interest of existing Limited Partners therein. Although
such Limited Partners will contribute their pro rata share of prior capital contributions

104 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 59, *59

Introduction

In recent years, federal and state enactments have given crime victims extensive rights to participate in criminal cases. Many of
these rights apply only after the filing of criminal charges, such as the victim's right to be heard during court proceedings. A
crime victim's right to deliver an impact statement at sentencing, for instance, can only be exercised after a prosecutor has filed
charges against a defendant and obtained a conviction. Other rights, however, can apply even before the formal filing of
charges. As one example, the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) ! extends to federal crime victims the right to confer with
prosecutors. But can victims exercise this right before charges have been filed?

This question has tremendous practical importance. In many cases, prosecutors negotiate pleas well before any charges are ever
drafted. If crime victims’ rights enactments do not extend rights to victims until the formal filing of charges, then crime victims
can be effectively excluded from the plea bargaining process. Yet the exclusion of victims in early stages of a criminal case
affects more than just the content of a plea deal. Crime victims will also lose other important rights in the process if the formal
filing of charges is the necessary trigger for those rights. If, for example, prosecutors work out a nonprosecution agreement
with an offender, they need not notify his victims of what they are doing or of the fact that potential charges will never be filed.

The issue of pre-charging rights has most prominently surfaced in connection with federal cases. In 2010, the Department of
Justice's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) weighed in on the issue and released a legal opinion arguing that victims of federal
crimes have no CVRA rights during a federal criminal investigation. ? The Justice Department took the position that rights
under the CVRA do not apply until prosecutors formally initiate criminal proceedings by filing a complaint, information, or
indictment. The Department claims to find support for that limiting interpretation of the statute in its plain language and
legislative history.

Shortly after the Department released its opinion, one of the CVRA's congressional sponsors, then-Senator Jon Kyl, sent a letter
to Attorney General Eric Holder strenuously objecting to the Department's conclusions. Senator Kyl directly stated his view
that when Congress enacted the [*62] CVRA, it intended to protect crime victims throughout the criminal justice process -
from the investigative phases to the final conclusion of a case. ? Senator Kyl contested the Department's analysis of the statute
and, in particular, its use of statements from him during Congress's consideration of the CVRA.

This Article sides with the CVRA's cosponsor and concludes that crime victims’ CVRA rights attach before formal charging.
Both the CVRA's plain language and its legislative history lead inexorably to this conclusion, as every court that has considered
this issue has concluded. This Article also contends that, as a matter of sound public policy, crime victims should have rights
before the formal filing of criminal charges.

This Article proceeds in four parts. Part I frames the issues under discussion by defending the importance of extending rights to
crime victims during criminal investigations. Part I also provides background on victims' rights and gives a concrete illustration
of a case in which the question of pre-charging rights for crime victims has arisen - specifically, the Jeffrey Epstein sex abuse
case before a federal court in Florida. In that case, girls victimized by Epstein have argued that they should have been consulted
about a federal nonprosecution agreement; Department attorneys have responded that because prosecutors never filed charges,
government officials had no formal obligations to inform the girls.

just Eli Zeira’s failure to activate the sayeret’s listening devices in Eygpt,
deeply damaging though that was. It was judgement. Inside Aman, a kind of
groupthink had taken hold. It was rooted in a confident, costly misconception
which went unchallenged: that Egypt would never risk another war without an
air force capable of breaching our defences and striking towns and cities deep
inside Israel. No one pressed the alternative scenario: that Sadat might strike
with more limited territorial objectives and, under cover of his SAM batteries
on the other side of the Suez Canal, advance into the Sinai.

In the Lebanon war, the inquiry suggested, Yehoshua Saguy did try to warn
the generals, and the government, about major risks. But individual ministers
testified that they hadn’t heard, hadn’t been there, or hadn’t understood, leading
the inquiry to stress the responsibility of a Rosh Aman to ensure not just that his
message was conveyed, but that it was received as well.

I set out to address both problems. Inside the department, I insisted on
making all our preconceptions open to challenge. I set up a unit whose sole
function was to play devil’s advocate when a consensus was reached. It began
with the opposite conclusion and, through a competing analysis of the data, and
logical argument, tried to prove it. I also wanted to be challenged on my
preconceptions. I assigned a bright young major as my personal intelligence-
and-analysis aide. He read everything that crossed my desk and could access
any material in the department. “You have no responsibility to agree with any of
the analysts, or with me,” I said. “Part of your job is to disagree.”

In the Lebanon war, Saguy had faced an additional problem. He was
excluded from some government meetings at which crucial decisions were
made. That was out of his control. I didn’t want it to be out mine. I raised the
issue with Begin in our first meeting. “If you want to get the maximum value
from your head of intelligence,” I said, “you should make sure he’s there not
just after, but when decisions are made.” Yet he was now only months from
leaving office, exhausted by the war and its aftermath. He waved his hand
weakly in response, as if to say none of it mattered. His successor, in October
1983, was Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir. Ideologically, he was cut from the
same cloth: an advocate from the 1940s of securing a Jewish state in all of
Palestine, by whatever force necessary. He’d broken with Begin’s pre-state
Irgun militia to set up a group called Lehi, which went further and carried out
political assassinations: the 1944 killing of Lord Moyne, Britain’s Minister for

Sharing worst practices

During the 1990s there was much discussion in the
major democracies regarding the export of “best prac-
tices,” meaning the institutions, policies, and ways

f doing things that had strengthened democratic
governance in some of the more successful post-au-
thoritarian societies, especially in Central Europe.

ore recently, modern authoritarian regimes have
turned this concept on its head by sharing their own
experiences with laws and tactics that have the effect
f retarding democratic development.

e}

o}

Laws restricting the autonomy and funding of NGOs
have been widely copied around the world. Many of
the affected countries tolerated civil society activism
in the period after the Cold War, only to move ina
more repressive direction after the most prominent
color revolutions alerted incumbent leaders to poten-
tial threat posed by civic activism. Once Russia had
demonstrated a willingness to adopt legislation and
then enforce it, other countries followed suit, first in
Eurasia but subsequently in Africa, Asia, the Middle
East, and Latin America.

Governments that adopt such laws seldom if ever
shut down the civil society sector entirely. Instead,
they deal with NGOs selectively, tolerating those that
present no threat to the status quo, monitoring oth-
ers, and repressing those that the leadership regards
as a potential focus of opposition activity. Even some
democracies, such as India, Indonesia, and Kenya,
have enacted laws to strengthen state control over
NGOs. But the most serious restrictions have been
imposed by authoritarian regimes.

According to a 2013 report, 12 countries had prohib-
ited foreign funding for NGOs outright while another
49 placed restrictions on foreign donations. For
authoritarian leaders, the imposition of foreign fund-
ing restrictions is a convenient tactic in that it makes
it difficult for the organization to function effectively
but falls short of an outright ban, which could attract
sharper criticism. Furthermore, governments can jus-
tify their action on grounds of protecting sovereignty
against foreign interference—a potent argument in
an era when nationalist ideas have garnered greater
public support. Thus in rejecting an appeal to govern-
ment policies that restrict NGO work, the Venezuelan
Supreme Court spoke of foreign assistance as “a
typical manifestation of the interventionist policies of
a foreign power to influence the internal affairs of the
Venezuelan state.!”

China piles on

In early 2016, joining its authoritarian colleagues,
China acopted its first formal law meant to regulate
the country’s rapidly expanding NGO sector. Previous-
ly, foreign NGOs registered as commercial enterprises
and conducted their advocacy work “off the books.”
Under the new law, foreign NGOs are subject to a se-
ries of additional bureaucratic hurdles, some of which
could seriously impinge on their work.

For example, foreign NGOs are now required to join in
partnership with a Chinese organization. In practice,
this could make it difficult for NGOs that work on sen-
sitive issues like the rule of law to function, as Chinese
organizations would be hesitant to join a foreign entity
in pursuing such a politically explosive mission.

Moreover, foreign NGOs will be compelled to register
with the police rather than the Ministry of Civil Affairs,
as had been the case.'® The law gives the police
sweeping powers to detain staff, restrict activities or
events, or regulate an NGO's ability to open an office.'®
An NGOs registration can be revoked under a vague
clause that forbids spreading rumors, engaging in
defamation, or publishing “other harmful information
that endangers state security or damages the national
interest.”°

The new law was passed in the context of intensified
repression, an economic slowdown, and a drive by
the Xi Jinping leadership to suppress discussion of
“Western ideas” in the media and at universities. Even
as the country’s leadership boasted of China's role as
a world power, the country’s education minister, Yuan
Guiren, felt compelled in 2015 to warn against the use
of “textbooks promoting Western values” in Chinese
classrooms.

Indeed, the authorities had carried out a series of
arrests, focusing on precisely the sort of indepen-
dent-minded activists with whom reform-oriented
international NGOs would expect to collaborate: hu-
man rights lawyers, advocates for minority rights and
religious freedom, and women's rights campaigners.”
Around the time of the law's adoption, the govern-
ment took the unusual step of showcasing a televised
confession by a Swedish citizen who had worked with
legal reform groups in China. Xinhua claimed that

the activist, Peter Dahlin, had served a human rights
organization that “hired and trained others to gather,
fabricate, and distort information about China.22

ish figure that attracts girls.” He approached a model agency called
Model Mayhem, which recommended a photographer. He had some
concern about that photographer because he, as Snowden wrote in
a post, “shoots mostly guys.” Snowden said he was “a little worried
he might, you know, try to pull my pants off and choke me to death
with them, but he turned out to be legit and is a pretty damn good
model photographer.” He posted the photographs on the Internet.
The lack of any paid job offers dashed Snowden’s hopes for a model-
ing career.

Around this time, he began dating Lindsay Mills, an extremely
attractive nineteen-year-old art student at the Maryland Institute
College of Art. Jonathan Mills, Lindsay’s father, was an applications
developer at the Oracle Corporation. According to him, Snowden
met his daughter on an Internet dating site. Snowden and Mills had
much in common. They both had divorced parents who gave them a
great deal of latitude in conducting their personal lives. Both of them
were keenly interested in perfecting their bodies through exercise

© and diet regimes. Mills’s only paid employment over the next eight ©
years would be as a fitness and yoga instructor in Maryland. When
they first met, they both had ambitions to be models, and neither of
them had inhibitions about posing provocatively for photographers.
They both also had a desire to travel to exotic places, including cities
in Asia. Mills had spent four month in Guilin, China, before meeting
Snowden.

As bleak as his prospects as a high-school dropout might have
seemed, Snowden had an unexpected stroke of good fortune in the
spring of 2006. The CIA offered him a $66,o00-a-year job as a CIA
communications officer. “I don’t have a degree of ANY type. In fact,
I don’t even have a high school diploma,” Snowden boasted in May
2006 on the website Ars Technica under his alias. He added, with
only a slight exaggeration, “I make 70K.”

How did Snowden get the job? The CIA’s minimum requirements
in 2006 for a job in its clandestine division included a bachelor’s or
master’s degree and a strong academic record, with a preferred GPA
of 3.0 or better.

The CIA needed technical workers in 2006. But even if Snowden

Jay,

Please accept my apologies for not getting back to you sooner but I was a little under the weather
yesterday. I hope that you enjoyed your Thanksgiving.

Regarding the issue of due diligence concerning Judge Davis’ selection, I’d like to make a few
observations. First, Guy Lewis has known for some time that Judge Davis was making
reasonable efforts to secure Aaron Podhurst and Bob Josephsberg for this assignment. In fact,
when I told you of Judge Davis’s selection during our meeting last Wednesday, November 21°,
you and Professor Dershowitz seemed very comfortable, and certainly not surprised, with the
selection. Podhurst and Josephsberg are no strangers to nearly the entire Epstein defense team
including Guy Lewis, Lili Ann Sanchez, Roy Black, and, apparently, Professor Dershowitz who
said he knew Mr. Josephsberg from law school. Second, Podhurst and Josephsberg have
long-standing stellar reputations for their legal acumen and ethics. It’s hard for me to imagine
how much more vetting needs to be done.

The United States has a statutory obligation (Justice for All Act of 2004) to notify the victims of
the anticipated upcoming events and their tights associated with the agreement entered into by
the United States and Mr. Epstein in a timely fashion. Tomorrow will make one full week since
you were formally notified of the selection. I must insist that the vetting process come to an end,
Therefore, unless you provide me with a good faith objection to Judge Davis’s selection by COB
tomorrow, November 28, 2007, I will authorize the notification of the victims. Should you give
me the go-ahead on Podhurst and Josephsberg selection by COB tomorrow, I will simultaneously
send you a draft of the letter. I intend to notify the victims by letter after COB Thursday,

November 29. Thanks,

Jeff

Confessions of a Pickup Artist Chaser. / was still processing a lot of stuff I'd learned
about pickup artist tactics and pickup artist attitudes, and that's reflected in this piece.
But there's a lot more to it, from working out some stuff about polyamory to my feelings
about marriage. A lot of these thoughts are developed further in Confessions.

KK ok

Chemistry
It's a long story and a short one, but I guess all of them are.

I'm 27. It's about that age: A lot of my compatriots are getting married lately -- most
monogamously, some to a primary polyamorous partner. I myself have a stack of
relationships in my past. Some were monogamous, some polyamorous. Some have been
on-and-off, some short-term, some long-term (5 or 6 years was the longest). Lately I've
been processing some tough questions about polyamory, but I'd like to stick with it.

And I've been thinking a lot about what I want in a primary polyamorous partner. The
kind of guy I could marry. I wonder if I'll ever get to that point. I wonder if I'd know him
if I saw him.

te OK ok

I met Mr. Ambition at one of the aforementioned weddings. Several people
recommended that I talk to him, and we liked each other right away. Mutual friends used
words like zealot to describe him; let's just say he's got an intense history of dedicated
activism. Charisma, integrity, and pure energy pour off him. His words are almost always
articulate and challenging. He can socially dominate a room without thinking. He works a
challenging job ten hours per day; exercises two hours; socializes several hours; sleeps
and eats when he can. He gives hugs easily, laughs easily, hands out compliments like
candy.

Mr. Ambition is most definitely not a neutral personality. Of course, neither am I.

At the time, I was just coming out of the worst stage of my research on pickup artists -- a
subculture of men who trade tips on how to seduce women. Also, I'd just had one of those
breakups where I was too busy feeling stupid to properly understand how hurt I was.
(Don't you hate those?) You can read all about those Dramatic Events in my upcoming
book Confessions of a Pickup Artist Chaser. In the meantime, suffice to say that I felt...
flattened.

Arguably, I should have had a sign taped to my forehead that read: Emotionally
Unavailable.

I went to dinner with Mr. Ambition later that week. At the end of the meal, he sat back
and looked at me. You're so authentic, he said.

I haven't felt very authentic lately, I said frankly, but his words felt good. Like a balm.
Like I was healing.

In which the Seventh Sense reveals a fundamental insight: Connection changes the
nature of an object.

1.

Several hundred years ago the forces of the Enlightenment and the Industrial
Revolution, like twin hammers, began working away at the roots of an ancient order.
The powerful ideas of liberty, freedom of thought, science, democracy and
capitalism - these all layered one upon the other. They washed, like irresistible
tides, across the institutions and kingdoms and beliefs of Europe and in a process of
revolution, of invention, of destruction and creation, they put a period at the end of
one era, and began the very first lines of anew human story. These forces produced
what we know today as the modern world: Trains knit new markets, science tripled
life spans, democracy liberated politics. Confronted with this really irresistible
pressure, a gulf opened. The world started to cleave. On one side were the nations
and peoples that our modern economists would come to know and label as a
“Convergence Club.” ? This group mastered and refined and then used the tools of
their era to become industrial, democratic, scientific and rich.1° They left the age of
kings and feudal lords, of alchemists and all-knowing priests behind. At the same
time, a “Divergence Club” appeared. These nations missed the essential turn. They
were trapped. Old ideas, useless habits of power, inescapable history - varied
shackles held them back from the punctuated shift to a new, more advanced
equilibrium. Russia, China, much of Latin America and Africa - for them, the leap to
being honestly modern was fatally elusive. Even today, they struggle to catch up.

Weare now in the earliest stages of a shift that promises to be still more
consequential than the one that enlightened and industrialized our world over
several centuries after the Dark Ages. The essence of this shift is best captured by
the prodigious explosion of different types of connection emerging around us now -
financial, trade, information, transport, biological - and the innovative combinations
that follow these and other fast, fresh links. Modern, highly-connected systems are
different than those with less connection. And, as we'll come to see, they are
particularly different from those with slower connection. We experience power
through networks now, as once we experienced it through brick-bound institutions
like universities or military headquarters or telephone company switches. You can
no more understand the operations of Hizb’allah or China’s central bank or the most
valuable Internet companies today without at least this frank admission: Their

When I began teaching, Harvard Law School had been admitting women for only about a decade,
and some of the professors still didn’t believe that women could make really good lawyers. I
encountered this prejudice at the end of my first year of teaching.

The star student in my first year class was a woman from New York who eventually became a
distinguished judge. She received an A grade on the final exam. Three of her other first year
teachers also gave her A grades, but her contracts teacher gave her a D. She came to me upset
about her D grade and asked me to read her exam. I read it and it was clearly of A quality. I was
sure that her contracts professor had simply made a transcription error and so I went to his office
to discuss it. He glanced at the exam and said, “Oh yes, I remember her. She doesn’t think like a
lawyer. That’s why I gave her a D.” I later learned that this professor has been opposed to
admitting women to Harvard Law School because he believed that women don’t think like
lawyers.

This episode persuaded me that something had to be done about the lingering prejudices of some
of the faculty. Accordingly, I proposed “blind grading” of all exams, so that professors could not
find out the gender of the student until after the grades were submitted.

Several years later, my wife and I, and my son Elon, had dinner with then President Clinton and
the First Lady. We had invited them to our synagogue on Martha’s Vineyard for Rosh Hashanah
services and they asked us to join them for dinner after the services. (More on this later) During
dinner, I asked Hillary why she had chosen Yale Law School over Harvard. She laughed and
said, “Harvard didn’t want me.” I said I was sorry that Harvard had turned her down, but she
replied “no, I received letters of acceptance from both schools.” She explained that a then
boyfriend had invited her to The Harvard Law School Christmas dance, at which several Harvard
Law School professors were in attendance. She was introduced to one of them and asked him for
advice about which law school to attend. The professor looked at her and said, “We have about
as many women as we need here. You should go to Yale. The teaching there is more suited to
women.” I asked her who the professor was and she told me she couldn’t remember his name but
that she thought it started with a “B.” A few days later, we met the Clintons at a party. I came
prepared with yearbook photos of all the professors from that year whose name began with “B.”
She immediately identified the culprit. He was the same professor who had give my A student a
D, became she didn’t think like a lawyer. It turned out, of course, that it was this professor—and
not the two brilliant women he was prejudiced against—who didn’t think like a lawyer. Lawyers
are supposed to act on the evidence, rather than on their prejudgments. The sexist professor
ultimately became a judge on the Internal Court of Justice—a perfect fit! (More on this later.)

Nor was Professor “B” alone in his negative views of women as lawyers. One teacher refused to
call on women, except on one day of the year, which he called “ladies day.” On that day, he
picked on them and verbally abused them to the point that some deliberately stayed away. The
dean of the law school, Erwin Griswold, a great defender of civil liberties and civil rights, was a
blatant misogynistic. Near the beginning of my teaching career, he invited the new assistant
professor—me—and all the women students—a small number—to his home for dinner. He
warned the women that if they came to law school to find husbands, they would be disappointed:
“Harvard Law School men don’t date Harvard Law School girls. They date girls from Lesley” (a
neighboring women’s college). He then went around the table asking all the women students why

Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts

V: Yes, he did. He did all the time. The worst one that I heard from his own mouth was this
pretty 12 year old girls he had flown in for his birthday. It was a surprise birthday gift
from one of his friends and they were from France. I did see them, I did meet them.
Jeffrey bragged afterwards after he met them that they were 12 year olds and flown over
from France because they’re really poor over there, and their parents needed the money
or whatever the case is and they were absolutely free to stay and flew out. Those were
the worst ones. He was constantly bragging about girls’ ages or where he got them from
or their past and how terrible their past was and good he is making it for them.

JS: Where were the 12 year old girls flown to from France? Where did they come to?
V: Palm Beach.

JS: | And were they flown in on Jeff's private plane or did they get transported?

V: No. They were transported by somebody else.

JS: | Ok. Was the sexual activity that went on on the airplane conducted in such a way so that
any of the crew was aware of what was going on?

V: They were told to knock if they had to come out, if the crew had to come out. They were
told, you know, to come out as little as possible, so they weren’t out there hanging out
watching everything, no, but it doesn’t take an idiot to put two and two together to say
well there’s a whole bunch of half dressed teenagers on board with this old man who is
constantly being massaged by them and he wants me to keep the door shut for what
reason? I mean, only they could put that together, but yeah, they knew.

JS: | Did Mr. Epstein ever talk to you about people of power and influence owing him favors?

V: He would laugh about it, you know, I never really knew what to take serious from Jeffrey
because he was such a funny character at times. You never knew if what he was saying
was true or not. Yeah, lots of people owed him favors from what he told me. He’s got
everybody in his pocket, and he would laugh about he helps people for the sole purpose
in the end they owe him something. That’s why I believe he does so many favors in the
first place.

JS: | When and how did you first become aware that Mr. Epstein was in trouble with the law?

V: I was first informed by, I think someone from the FBI called me first and started to ask
me questions, and J started to answer the questions but then fear took over, and I just said
look, I don’t know what’s going on, I’ve got a young family that I don’t want to risk, you
know, please don’t bother me about this again, and it was real short simple conversation,
and within a week or 2, I had gotten a call from Jeffrey’s attorney, and then a week later,
Jeffrey himself.

determined to focus on the end goal: initially, at least, a framework agreement, and
over time a final political resolution of our conflict. Ever since the outbreak of the
Palestinians’ first intifada, I believed this was as much in Israel’s own interest as
theirs. Yet when I entered office, we had no way of knowing whether Arafat
wanted two states living side-by-side in peace. I felt it was my duty to find out,
and, if the answer was yes, to put a peace agreement in place. I felt the same about
way about Syria and Hafez al-Assad.

When I left office, I believed I had achieved the most important goals of my
premiership. We were out of Lebanon. Though we couldn’t achieve the peace
agreements I had hoped for, it was not for lack of trying. Along the way, Israel had
demonstrated to the world that it was able and willing to consider painful
compromises, and that it was the Arab leaders who, at least for now, were unequal
to the challenge of making peace. If I'd been able to retain the backing of the
voters who made me Prime Minister in 1999, we might even have moved ahead on
unilateral disengagement from the Palestinians, dramatically altering the trajectory
of our relationship. Yet even without that, Camp David did delineate the terms of
any future peace arrangement. When and if conditions allowed a resumption of
serious negotiating efforts, the shape, and indeed most of the details, of a final
peace between our peoples were now clear.

I was on holiday in the summer of 2001 when Clinton phoned me. 7he New
Times had run a piece on how and why the summit, and the subsequent
negotiations through the end of the year, ended in failure. When I later read the
article, by the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Deborah Sontag, I found it a
meandering mix of opinions garnered from an assortment of Americans,
Europeans, Israelis and Palestinians, including Arafat himself, with the overall
conclusion that Clinton and I had not offered as generous a deal as was assumed
and that it was somehow unfair to suggest the Palestinians deserved blame for
rejecting it. There had been several other articles in various publications along the
same lines. I didn’t see much point at this stage in setting the record straight. To
the extent the content of the Times piece bothered me, it was a simple, but
important, error of fact. Quoting Arafat himself, Sontag wrote that during the back-
patio discussion I had with him at the dinner in Kochav Yair shortly before the new
intifada, he’d “implored me to block Mr Sharon’s plans” to visit the Temple
Mount. Arafat didn’t raise the issue at all, and presumably knew that we had
consulted his West Bank security chief to ensure it happened quickly, avoided the

messages. When I finally ran into Richard, I asked why he'd been ignoring me, and he
laughed. I knew you'd accuse me of ignoring you, he said. I felt like I'd walked into a
trap.

I was hurt, obviously. I was surprised by how hurt I was. The problem with my youthful
water metaphor is that water is basically invulnerable, but I am not... and when I was
younger and more open, I had much more trouble setting important boundaries.

On the other hand, I had to admit that it was funny, too. I mean, it wasn't like I didn't see
this coming. I mean, my coming-out story includes a portrait of Richard at his most
difficult. One of the friends I share with Richard made a comment about leopards and
spots. Maybe my life is a soap opera, but it could also be a sitcom with the most amazing
characterization ever.

I enlisted a cold, brilliant, evil-hearted friend to help draft my final letter to Richard. The
letter was very short. Arguably, it was brutal. It read:

Economists recognize that the most robust relationships are formed through a plethora
of implicit agreements. Apparently, these agreements are not present, and probably won't
be. Cheers.

Economics arguments in the comments are encouraged. More importantly, readers may
feel free to steal that letter for use on whoever is trying to pull their chain.

I received a couple texts from Mr. Ambition, a few days after he gave me the fan. He said
there had been a death in his family. But I don't want to talk about that, actually,” he
wrote. I just want to check in and see how you're doing.”

I thought about how he laughed when he was hurt. I thought about how he'd once told me
that he wanted drama. I thought about his confusing reactions to S&M. I thought about
how he outsourced his emotional labor to his friends. I thought about all the emotion I'd
felt in him, coiled and caught and turned in on itself like a caged dragon.

I wondered if he wanted me to push him to talk.

I'm so sorry, I texted back. But I understand if you don't want to talk about it. I'm
doing fine.”

He invited me to a social event a week later, but I declined. I didn't reach out to him for a
while after that, and he didn't reach out to me. I heard later that Mr. Ambition asked one
of my friends whether they thought he owed me anything.

My friend told him, quite accurately: No, you don't owe her anything.

If anything, I owe him. I'm not sure what I owe him, but I'm sure I owe him something.

Obama nominee Penny Pritzker's $80 million mistake 
President Obama's billionaire nominee to head the Commerce Department, Penny Prizker, understated her 
income by $80 million. 
Emily Heil 
Hey, these things happen: Penny Pritzker, President Obama's nominee to lead the Commerce Department, 
understated her income by some $80 million and had to file a correction to her government-filed 
disclosures, Bloomberg is reporting. 
That might sound like a lot of money, but it's all relative. Pritzker, whose family founded the Hyatt 
hotel chain, is worth about $1.5 billion. So it's easy to see how a few million — or 80 — could go 
missing. 
Maybe she left it in the other purse? 
A spokeswoman told Bloomberg that the $80 million was a substantial amount and that Pritzker's advisers 
corrected the error as soon as they realized it. 
Per Bloomberg: Documents released last week show Pritzker received $32.2 million for a decade's worth of 
consulting on the restructuring of domestic trusts, but new filings indicated she made at least $80 
million more than that.

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018278.txt,"programmer’s line, runs on a very fast clock in a world of constant innovation, and it
applies to nations and ideologies, your habits and mine. Think of General Liu again
for amoment: “A major state can lose many battles.” Those five lost American wars
over the last 50 years weren’t fatal. They wore only a bit on our national pride and
our position because they weren't strategic losses. But our next errors, which may
come without the firing of a single shot, could be far more costly because of the slick,
strategic slope on which we are now moving. “It is one thing to struggle heroically to
get out of danger,” Liu wrote in another manifesto. “But it’s better to see the danger
before it even begins to sprout.”5¢

Six paradoxes trace the immensity of the gaps we now face.

First: We find ourselves confronted, almost daily, with an unnerving mismatch
between our interests and our means. The most powerful nation in human history
finds itself unable to achieve even simple military and diplomatic goals.

Second: A global crisis of faith in our institutions is now under way. No significant
institution, from the US congress to the Euro to your local newspaper, is more
trusted than it was a decade ago. Many of our most essential institutions seem
destined to be victims to the logic of “forced obsolescence” that makes our phones,
our cars and our televisions of ten years ago feel like antiques.

Third: The connected age lets us see and measure, with historic precision, the
problems we face - yet we can do almost nothing about them. Global warming,
wealth inequality, species destruction, nuclear accidents, terror killings - we can see
all of these in rattlingly sharp detail, instantly, miraculously. Watch the Fukishima
reactor meltdown! See BP oil leak into the Gulf of Mexico in HD! The rise and fall of
markets, the moves of distant wars, rivers of refugees appear almost as if we were
tuning into a football game. But we can only watch. “Hey, do something!” we want to
shout as we see financial or ideological or religious chaos spill towards us. But
nothing seems to move; and what does move makes the problems worse. This
impotence of being “just spectators”, works like a nutcracker on the credibility of
the people and institutions we expect to fix these problems.

Fourth: Many new challenges exhibit a worrying non-linearity. Small forces produce
massive effects. One radical teenager, a single mis-placed commodity order, or a few
bad lines of computer code can paralyze an entire system. The scale of this
whiplashing grows every day, because the network itself grows, it turns pindrop
noises into global avalanches. Dangers, accidents, crises were once local. A drought
in California was, largely, a drought in California. A slowdown in China hit Shenzhen
or Shanghai, not South America. Now, as networks overlap and influence each other,
crises cascade at a new, stunning and comprehensive scale. And while we know

Yet especially with my main points of contact in the administration — first Bob
Gates and then his successor, Leon Panetta, as Secretary of Defense —our broadly
shared views, mutual respect, and the strength of the US-Israeli alliance
outweighed any of that. Neither they, nor indeed President Obama, wavered from
their commitment to the principle that Israel needed to retain our “qualitative
military advantage” over any combination of threats we might face, nor to the $3
billion package of annual US aid that underpinned it. We were even able to agree
on additional US backing for our increasingly effective range of anti-missile
systems: the Arrow, against long-range ballistic missiles, developed in
coordination with the US defense contractor Raytheon; “David’s Sling,” to target
enemy forces’ mid-range missiles, cruise missiles and aircraft; and our new Iron
Dome system, integrating sophisticated Israeli radar and guidance technology and
designed to deal with the missile threat from Hizbollah on our northern border and
Hamas in Gaza. It had not yet been used in battle. But from test firings, we were
confident it could destroy incoming rockets with nearly 90-per-cent success.

By late 2011, the issue of Iran had taken on much greater urgency. There was
still no sign the American-led diplomatic efforts were succeeding in removing the
nuclear threat. As for an American military strike, though the President
intermittently declared that “all options” remained on the table, I knew from senior
administration members that it was extremely unlikely to happen. Iran, meanwhile,
had been acquiring thousands more centrifuges, more uranium, and heavier
protection around its key sites. And the “window of vulnerability” was now only
about a year away.

Operationally and politically, at least now a majority of the key players in Israel
agreed that we had to be prepared to take military action if there was no alternative
way to rein in the Iranians. Ashkenazi’s successor as chief-of-staff, Benny Gantz,
had signed off on the attack plan. While the Iranians were getting ever closer to
nuclear-weapons capability, the strike force that we were assembling was also
better equipped, trained and prepared to mount a complex, yet almost certainly
successful, operation. The damage to Iran’s nuclear ambitions would be
considerably less than if we had acted earlier. But our intelligence analysts still
estimated we could set back the Iranians’ program by about two years.

The immediate problem turned out to be timing. A major joint military exercise
with the Americans, agreed on two years earlier, was due to take place in Israel in
April 2012. It would include Patriot missile batteries, naval vessels, and thousands

slammed down phone receiver. Leaving only an echo of the dial tone to
answer back too. I was to paralyzed from the shocking response. “What
have I just done?” was the first thing that entered my thoughts.
Overwhelmed with guilt I felt like I was falling down a deep and dark
hole and then the tears began to flood in. Here I was standing at the dawn
of a new happy life for myself and I couldn’t see past how bad I had let
Jeffrey down not yet seeing the hold he had on me.

Like my knight on a white horse, in came my hero to soothe my
somberness. He rushed over to the bed where I was beating myself up
mentally and wiped the falling tears from my cheeks. “I take it that it
didn’t go so well...huh?” Sniffling through my sobs I managed to tell
him that “It doesn’t matter anymore all I care about is you and leaving all
of that life behind me!” I wrapped my arms around him and he asked me
in a half joking voice “Then why are you crying?” He got me almost
laughing now too “I guess it’s just so scary taking such a huge plunge
away from what I’m used too and taking such a big move to another
country. It’s just all so different and I’m just trying to comprehend
everything that is happening in such a short time.” Always out to lift my
spirits his next comments made me gush in laughter “You think that was
a hard phone call wait until I call my Sicilian mother! Watch this, I know
exactly what she’ll say. First it’ll be a saga about how I’m killing her with
my selfish actions then it’ll be about how she’s going to kill herself for
doing such a terrible job raising normal children. Don’t worry though,
she’ll love every second of it. Wogs thrive off of the drama in their lives
and off everybody else’s for that matter!!” He was pretty much on the dot
when he told me how she’d react to the news. In the end after relentlessly
trying to change his mind, she sighed, “If it was going to be anybody to
do something as crazy as this, Robbie, it would be you!” It wasn’t a
blessing as such but at least she wasn’t threatening suicide any longer.

Calling the closest of our families the night before our wedding to share
with them our announcement wasn’t celebrated by any members of either
sides but that didn’t discern us one bit. My parents took it well,
considering their only daughter was marrying a foreign man that they
didn’t know from the next guy on the street and too top it off I was
moving to Australia, permanently. When I asked my Dad many years
later why they hadn’t put up a fight, he just simply replied that nobody
expected it too last very long. Fair enough, | thought. I don’t think
anyone did at first...even us at our toughest times. We were a rare
attribute these days in the numb era we have all been accustomed to
living in, turning nothing into something, which I had also come to
realize, was the most precious gift in life... Love.

Falling asleep was easy to do in his arms that night. I laid my head on
top of his chest listening to the drum of his beating heart. I had never felt
like I was more at home than ever before in my life. He pulled me gently
in closer to him, letting me know that he was there for me even when the
lights went out and the thoughts would usually creep in. Amazing how he
knew what I needed without even asking for it. Wishing for something
like this my whole life I thought I was being such a fool in so many ways,
but I was so wrong. The way his pretty eyes looked at me with such an
understanding and compassionate sincerity made me want to trust his
words and believe the love that he was offering me was indeed real.

The next morning, Robbie was up and out of bed early to pick up our
tailored wedding suits and dresses for our big day at Doi Cept Temple.
His best friend from high school days that was travelling with him from
Australia met him in the hotel lobby at seven o’clock. He was going to be
joining us for the wedding as Robbie’s best man. He still hadn’t been able
to find black shoes to go with the suit, so after he dropped off my dress
back to me he was off again to try and find himself a pair of decent
looking ones. Overjoyed with excitement I was thrilled from the second I
kissed Robbie good-bye for the last time before we were officially
married. Looking in the same mirror only a week ago I was now a
different person, I felt like I was plunging into a bottomless abyss. Here I
go, | thought to myself as | plunged out the door letting the butterflies in
my stomach carry me all the way to my nearly husband.

I had to go to the beauticians that morning for my pre- wedding makeup
and dressing. The ladies who were doing my hair and face at the salon did
a great job making me feel so beautiful for my special occasion that every
girl dreams about their whole entire life. Requesting simplicity at best,
not wanting to go overboard with all of the wedding apparel! they tied my
long hair up into a knot wrapping around it a veil of flowers made up of
baby’s breath and small yellow and purple budding flowers. I couldn't
have dreamt it up better myself and when | met-my husband to be at the
bottom of the mountain he stood before me speechless “You look so...
beautiful!” were his first words that his mouth formed almost whispering
them. He took my hand and we walked into the sky lift together. Behind
us followed an interpreter that Robbie hired to translate the Buddhist
Monks ceremony speech for us English only speakers and then his best
friend, who only moments before gave him the best mans speech about
being the last chance to walk away from this and not get married to a girl
he hardly knew, but my Robbie wouldn’t hear a word of it. He already
made up his mind the instant he proposed and I said yes, “I was born to
be with this girl,” he told his best mate. “Alright then lets go do this
then!” Once he knew Robbie was sure in his decision he was more than
ecstatic for him. We were slowly lifted up the tremendous mountainside,

103 Minn. L. Rev. 844, *890

But that distinction has an upside: private prosecution and judicial review do not work in cases in which there is no direct
victim - or in which private parties do not realize they have been victimized, as in some cases of large-scale corporate or
government fraud, or in some cases of child pornography. !47 Federal prosecutors, however, take on just such cases as a core
part of their enforcement agenda. '48 On the other hand, federal oversight is limited in other important respects: federal
criminal enforcement authority is not fully coextensive with state criminal law; notably, for example, it provides effectively no

enforcement redundancy for ordinary domestic violence, rape, and other sexual assault offenses. '4°

[*891]
B. Three Kinds of Offenses: Corruption, Police Violence, Sexual Assault

Consider the efficacy for these oversight options with respect three types of offenses: local fraud or corruption, excessive use
of force and other wrongdoing by local law enforcement officers, and sexual assaults. These three classes of offenses have in
common that they have proven to be especially vulnerable to underenforcement. At the same time, the differences in how U.S.
criminal justice institutions have responded to underenforcement in each area highlight the efficacy and limits of the
federalism-based enforcement redundancy compared to the alternatives - both those U.S. jurisdictions reject (private
prosecution and judicial review) and a fourth, unique strategy they embrace: politically accountable prosecutors.

1. Public Corruption

Corrupt conduct by government officials is a category of wrongdoing especially likely to suffer from underenforcement, for
obvious reasons: we depend on one set of public officials, prosecutors and investigative agents, to stop wrongdoing by other
public officials - as well as by colleagues within their own ranks. Professional and even personal relationships often exist
between these groups of public officials. Even when the boundaries between lawful and unlawful conduct are clear and law

[1995] (QB) 1 Crim. App. 136 (Eng.)); R (Guest) v. DPP [2009] EWHC (Admin.) 594, [2009] 2 Crim. App. 26, at P 34 (Eng. and Wales); R
v. General Council of the Bar [1990] 3 All ER 137 (QB), at 137-38 (Eng. and Wales). For an overview, see Ashworth & Redmayne, supra
note 111; Christopher Hilson, Discretion to Prosecute and Judicial Review, Crim. L. Rev. 739 (1993) (examining case law regarding
prosecution decisions and subsequent judicial review); Appeals: Judicial Review of Prosecutorial Decisions, CPS,
https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/appeals -judicial-review-prosecutorial-decisions (last updated May 21, 2009). The European
Convention on Human Rights may impose affirmative obligations on member states that certain instances require prosecutions, or that more
generally require a state to maintain a criminal justice system that provides sufficient protection to citizens. English courts found that their
established standards of review of noncharging decisions, based in domestic law, have been held sufficient to meet any such obligation. See R
(FB) v. DPP [2009] EWHC (Admin.) 106,[2009] Crim. App. 38, at P 64 (Eng. and Wales) (discussing state obligations under Articles 2 and
3); see also R v. Killick [2011] EWCA (Crim.) 1608, [2012] 1 Crim. App. 10 at [48] (confirming victims' right to review). Judges may
require disclosure of internal prosecution documents, but they assess the lawfulness of nonprosecution without examining the underlying
evidence. See R (Da Silva) v. DPP [2006] EWHC (Admin) 3204 [24] (Eng. and Wales) (noting use of redacted investigative report and case
notes from CPS but disavowing evaluation of evidence).

113 See R v. DPP [2001] QB 330 at 337 (Eng. and Wales); R v. Metro. Police Commr. [1958] 2 QB 118, at 123-25 (Eng. and Wales);
Ashworth & Redmayne, supra note 111, at 221-22. Decisions by U.S. courts give no special solicitude to instances of nonprosecution in the
wake of injuries or deaths caused by prison guards or other law enforcement officials. See, e.g., Leeke v. Timmerman, 454 U.S. 84, 85-87
(1981) (rejecting state prison inmates! federal civil claim alleging bad faith by state officials to block issuance of arrest warrants against
guards on allegations of unnecessary beatings during prison uprising); Jnmates of Attica Corr. Facility v. Rockefeller, 477 F.2d 375, 382-83
(2d Cir. 1973) (rejecting request, on behalf of inmates injured or killed by state prison guards in the wake of a prison riot, that federal courts
compel state and federal prosecutors to charge guards, reaffirming that prosecutorial discretion is immune to judicial review). To facilitate
review, English prosecutors in some circumstances must provide public reasons for choosing not to file charges. See Jordan v. United
Kingdom (No. 2) [2003] 37 Eur. Ct. H.R. 52 PP 82-86, 122-23, 142-45 (holding that under article 2 of the European Convention on Human
Rights prosecutors should give reasons explaining a decision not to bring criminal charges after an investigation into a death caused by police
shootings); see also R v. DPP [2001] QB 330, at 347 (Lord Bingham, CJ) (Eng. and Wales) (In the absence of compelling grounds for not
giving reasons, we would expect the Director to give reasons in such a case [of non-prosecution]: to meet the reasonable expectation of
interested parties that either a prosecution will follow or a reasonable explanation for not prosecuting be given ... .); EU Council Directive
2012/29, supra note 100, art. 6, at 67 (requiring explanations to victims that can be subjected to review). Irish victim rights laws that took
effect in 2015 now require prosecutors to provide reasons to victims for declining to prosecute. See Mark Hilliard, New Laws on Rights of

ditions in which there is an equilibrium where player 2 chooses to
interact with player 1 only if player 1 cooperates without looking
(CWOL) and player 1 chooses to CWOL. We show that this equi-
librium is robust to both high degrees of rationality, as modeled by
subgame perfection and learning or evolutionary dynamics, as mod-
eled by the replicator dynamic. Using computer simulations, we
also show that it emerges with high frequency, even in the presence
of other equilibria. Additionally, we show that the ability for player
1 to avoid looking, and the ability for player 2 to detect looking
increases cooperation. We propose this model as a possible expla-
nation for a number of interesting phenomena, and thereby derive
novel predictions about these phenomena, including why we dislike
“flip-flopping” politicians and respect principled people more gen-
erally, why people cooperate intuitively, and why people feel disgust

when considering taboo trade-offs, and why people fall in love.

Cooperation occurs when we take on costs to help others. A key mechanism by which
cooperation is sustained is reciprocity: individuals condition their behavior on others’
past actions [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. In reality, we not only condition
on others’ past actions, but also on the decision-making process that lead to cooperation:
we place more trust in cooperators who do not take time to carefully weigh the costs of
cooperation and who do not try to collect data on such costs before deciding whether to
cooperate. For example, we are impressed by colleagues who agree to proofread a paper
without thinking twice, and view with suspicion those who ask, “how long will it take?”

species will likely be those that recognize, implicitly or explicitly, life’s interdependency. If
humans are to succeed as a species, our collective shame over destroying other life-forms should
grow in proportion to our understanding of their various ecological roles. Maybe the same
attention to one another that promoted our own evolutionary success will keep us from failing

Chapter 2

Propaganda at Home and Abroad

The following propositions have all appeared in the
Russian media over the past few years:

¢ The United States hired Islamic State terrorists
to sabotage the Russian commercial airliner that
was destroyed after takeoff in the Sinai in 2015.

¢ A three-year-old boy was crucified by the U.S.-
backed Ukrainian army in Slovyansk in 2014.

¢ The United States is planning a major war in Eu-
rope to enable Washington to cancel its national
debt.

¢ The downing of the Malaysian airliner over
eastern Ukraine in 2014 was in fact the central
ingredient in an elaborate, American-driven plot
to place blame on Russia.

e American policies will lead to a global “homosex-
ual sodomite tsunami.

This is just a small sample of similar claims or conjec-
tures that have made their way into Russian news cov-
erage, especially in the wake of Moscow's occupation
of Crimea and invasion of eastern Ukraine. They stand
as areminder that under Vladimir Putin, the Russian
media environment has been transformed from one
marked by vibrancy and diverse opinions (if not high
professional standards) to one dominated by blatant
propaganda on the most sensitive international topics
of the day.

The basic regime narrative of U.S.-led conspiracy is
applied to a broad set of themes: depression in oil
prices, downgrading of Russia's credit ratings, political
change in Ukraine, Russia's Olympics doping scandal.
Every problem, Russians are told, is due to American
plots and maneuvers.

Press freedom and democracy

A free press ranks among the most critical institutions
of liberal democracy. Among the reforms introduced
by Mikhail Gorbachev in his campaign to modernize
the Soviet system, glasnost, or openness, played the
most important role in challenging the decades-old
system of Soviet totalitarianism. Something similar
can be said of press freedom initiatives in other new
democracies during the latter part of the 20th century,

“If the 20th century was defined by
the battle for freedom of information
and against censorship, the 21st
century will be defined by malevo-
lent actors, states or corporations,
abusing the right to freedom of
information for quite other ends.”

—Vasily Gatov, media analyst

“Information wars have already
become standard practice and the
main type of warfare. The bombers
are now sent in after the information
campaign.”

—Dmitry Kiselyov, chief Russian propaganda strategist

particularly in postcommunist societies where strict
press censorship had prevailed for years. Even if the
professionalism and ethical standards of journalism
in those countries were not always up to the highest
levels, the fact that the press spoke with different
voices, different opinions, and even different biases
was a huge step toward a world in which democracy
was the norm.

Authoritarians push back

lt is precisely because of press freedom’s central
importance to democracy that the new generation of
authoritarian leaders has made its annihilation a top
priority. However, modern authoritarians recognize
that the methods of the print and analog broadcast
era—prepublication censorship and stilted, formula-
ic propaganda—were no longer viable in the age of
digital media and globalization.

At a minimum, governments that sought involvement
in the world economy found it advisable to tolerate a
measure of openness about budgets, economic data,
and those aspects of social life that are critical for
international business. Authoritarian leaders thus face
the dilemma of retaining domination over the political
story while permitting a degree of accurate informa-
tion about economic affairs.

the beginning summed up the feeling of most of the country at the end: “If you
don’t win, you lose... Hizbollah survived. It won the war.”

Without the botched handling of the war, I might well have remained a mere
member of the Labor Party and a private citizen. But when the commission of
inquiry released its report in April 2007, three people were singled out: Olmert,
Amir Peretz and Halutz. Olmert was portrayed as a military novice who’d gone
into battle without understanding the wartime role and responsibilities of a Prime
Minister. Halutz’s “excess of charisma” was held responsible for keeping
ministers, and military officers as well, from questioning his judgement or pressing
him for alternatives. Amir Peretz was found to be the wrong man in the wrong
cabinet post at the wrong time. Of the three, only Halutz seemed ready to take
personal responsibility. Even before the report came out, he resigned. Olmert and
Peretz were determined to stay put, despite calls to quit not just from the
opposition but from Tzipi Livni. Inside Labor as well, the war produced a clamor
for change. When a vote for party chairman was held in June 2007, I was chosen to
return in Peretz’s place.

Within days, I replaced him as Defense Minister as well. Yet the main item in
my in-box would no longer be Lebanon. I had been briefed a few weeks earlier by
Olmert on a threat hundreds of miles further away: a construction site in northeast
Syria, along the Euphrates River, where Mossad had uncovered evidence that the
Syrians, with technical help from North Korea and funding from Iran, were
building a nuclear reactor.

I had got to know Olmert fairly well over the years, initially when I was in the
kirya and both he and another rising Likud politician to whom I became closer,
Dan Meridor, were members of the Knesset’s defense committee. But from the day
I returned to the Israeli government in June 2007, there was growing tension
between us over dealing with the Syrian nuclear threat. It was not about whether
we should take military action to destroy the reactor, before the fuel rods arrived
on site and it could begin producing bomb-ready material. Just as under Menachem

any business involvement that could present a conflict of interest now that I had
left. Frankly, I saw nothing wrong with earning money through honest endeavor,
and using the proceeds to provide economic security for myself and my family,
and to give our grandchildren a better start in life than Nava’s or my own parents
had been able to do.

In the end, we didn’t move to Kfar Shmaryahu. But that was because of an even
more profound change in my life: I separated from Nava, after more than 30 years
together. When we had begun plans to move, I laughed off a warning from a
psychologist friend of mine that decisions like building a new house could lead to a
deeper reassessment of your life. But that is at least in part what happened. There
were also other changes that caused me to stop and take stock. I was no longer
Prime Minister. My father had passed away soon after I left office. Professionally,
I was exploring new areas and developing new interests. Nava and I had been
happily married since our twenties. We had three wonderful daughters, and a first
grandchild. Yet the more I thought about where we were in our lives, the more I
felt our future paths were pulling us in different directions. For both of us, the
separation was difficult, though it was made a bit less painful because Nava knew
that it had nothing to do with another woman, or another relationship. I did
imagine that I might one day meet someone else. But I was equally prepared for it
not happening. I certainly didn’t expect it any time soon.

When it did, it began by accident. A few weeks after our separation, I was
visiting the Knesset for a discussion about fixing Israel’s broken electoral system.
In the audience was a member of one of the civic associations pressing for reform:
Nili Priell, my first, and only, serious girlfriend before I met Nava. We spoke for a
few minutes afterwards. We agreed to meet again, and catch up with each other’s
lives, a week or so later. Both of us now had grown children. We were both on our
own. There is, I assume for everyone, something impossible to replicate about a
first love. Nili and I were given an unlikely second chance. That seemed to me an
extraordinary gift. It still does.

Yet if my personal life seemed full of new promise, the same could not be said
of the country I’d served for my whole adult life, or of the political party I'd led
into government. The continuing construction of the security fence along the West
Bank finally did begin to reduce the sheer number of Palestinian attacks: from
nearly 50 in 2002, to about half that number in 2003. But the suicide bombers who
did get through — from Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Fatah’s “Al-Aqsa Martyrs’

[*880]
4. Oversight of Declination Decisions in State Justice Systems

State justice systems do not go as far as the federal system does, much less provide the kind of oversight or victim recourse
that European systems now offer. And this is so despite the fact that all states have adopted substantial victims' bills of rights,
nearly all of which include rights for victims to consult with prosecutors. Most make clear that the consultation right attaches
only after the prosecutor decides to file charges. !*° Rights of administrative review are rare. !*! One reason for that is surely
structural. The U.S. Department of Justice is a hierarchically organized agency within which all federal prosecutors operate, a
structure that enables supervisory and quasi-independent review within the agency. But few states follow that model. Instead,
prosecutors in most states are locally elected and operate [*881] autonomously from state justice departments or attorneys
general, which generally exercise little, if any, oversight. !?? Administrative review of state prosecutors! charging decisions is
simply not feasible without major reorganization of state justice systems.

That structural barrier probably explains why state prosecutors’ decisions are functionally immune to administrative oversight,
but the lack of judicial oversight has a different origin. In accord with common law tradition, state and federal courts have
never meaningfully reviewed public prosecutors’ noncharging decisions. !73 In particular, they have unambiguously rejected
victims' claims of standing to challenge those decisions. '24 A few [*882] limited exceptions prove the rule. In cases of
private criminal complaints filed by alleged victims, Colorado, Michigan, Nebraska, and Pennsylvania authorize judges to
review public prosecutors' decisions not to charge. !?> Even when statutes grant courts the power to review (or even mandate
review) of charging and dismissal decisions, state judges consistently have refused to scrutinize the merits of prosecutors'
judgments. Many states have replaced the common law rule that gave prosecutors complete discretion to nolle prosequi (or
dismiss) any criminal charge with statutes that require judges to confirm that non-prosecution is in the interest of justice. 17°
Yet courts uniformly refuse to engage in meaningful review, inferring instead that those statutes require deference to

prosecutors. 12)

84 See Erikson v. Pawnee Cty. Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs, 263 F.3d 1151, 1154 (10th Cir. 2001) (finding no due process violation because private
attorney assisting prosecution did not control[] critical prosecutorial decisions). The first states to prohibit privately funded prosecutors
even under supervision of public prosecutors were Massachusetts, Michigan, and Wisconsin. See Commonwealth v. Gibbs, 70 Mass. (4 Gray)
146, 147-48 (1855); Meister v. People, 31 Mich. 99, 104-06 (1875); Biemel v. State, 37 N.W.244, 248-49 (Wis. 1888). See also Ireland,
supra note 83, at 49 (listing fifteen states that still approved privately funded prosecutors in 1900). Other states abolished this practice more
recently. See State ex rel. Wild v. Otis, 257 N.W.2d 361, 365 (Minn. 1977) (holding that party has no right of private prosecution); State v.
Harrington, 534 SW.2d 44, 48 (Mo. 1976) (holding that a right of private prosecution should not be permitted); People v. Calderone, 573
N.Y.S.2d 1005, 1007 (N.Y. City Crim. Ct. 1991) (concluding that under New York law private prosecutions by interested parties or their
attorneys present inherent conflicts of interest which violate defendants' due process rights); State v. Best, 186 S.E.2d 1, 4 (N.C. 1972) (noting
that a public prosecutor must be in charge of all prosecutions).

8 See, e.g., N.J. Ct. R. 3:23-9 (permitting private prosecutor with approval of the public prosecutor and court); N.J. Ct. R. 7:8-7(b)
(permitting private prosecutor for cross-complaints with court approval); State v. Harton, 296 S.E.2d 112, 113 (Ga. 1982) (private party not
allowed to prosecute without state approval); State v. Moose, 313 S.E.2d 507, 512-13 (N.C. 1984) (stating that private attorneys may assist
public solicitors where public solicitors retain control and management of prosecution); Cantrell, 329 S.E.2d at 25 (stating that private
attorneys may assist commonwealth attorneys with the permission of the prosecutor and the court); 63C Am. Jur. 2d Prosecuting Attorneys §
J2 (2018) (citing authority in some states that private attorneys may assist public prosecutors). For a state statute that apparently gives the
prosecuting witness a right to pay a private attorney to assist the public prosecutor without the latter's consent, see Kan. Stat. Ann. § 19-717
(2017); see also John D. Bessler, The Public Interest and the Unconstitutionality of Private Prosecutors, 47 Ark. IL. Rev. 51], 529, nn.71-72
(1994) (citing cases in majority of states allowing private prosecutors to assist in public prosecutions). Bessler identifies three states that
allow private prosecutors to participate without the consent or supervision of the district attorney, but in all three states, the public
prosecutor initiated and litigated the criminal charge, while the private prosecutor assisted in the litigation as counsel to a victim. Jd. at 529

a district attorney has neglected or refuseed to prosecute a properly grounded charge. See 16 Pa. Stat. and Cons. Stat. Ann. § 1409 (West

Comparison of Canadian Stock Markets

Similar to stock markets in the United States, Canadian stock markets vary significantly in terms
of their financial, liquidity and corporate governance requirements. Most Canadian publicly traded
cannabis-related companies trade on the CSE due to its less stringent requirements, as compared to the
TSX and TSXV. More than 10% of the companies traded on the CSE are cannabis-related companies.
The following chart provides a comparison of the TSX, TSXV and CSE.

News, yet chose to ignore our client's position contained therein. You also deliberately
embellished upon the story in The New York Daily News: nowhere in that article does it state
either that claimed that she had sex with our client, or that she did have sex
with him. In fact, quite the opposite, it states as follows: Nowhere in the court case or the
transcript does Ransome or anyone else allege that had sex with Dershowitz — or that she
was directed to.

It is staggering that a news organisation as well-resourced and with such a good reputation
as yours has conducted itself in this way.

Serious harm

Given the gravity of the Allegations — which include imputations of seriously improper
and/or unlawful behaviour — as well as the nature and extent of publication, there is no
question that serious harm has been, and will continue to be, caused to our client's
reputation.

The serious harm you have caused to our client's reputation is not only causing him (and his
family) great anguish, it is likely to cause significant damage to his ability to earn in the future.
He will hold you fully liable for this.

Immediate action required

In view of the above, our client requires you to immediately do the following:

I. Remove the Article from your website.

2. Publish an apology, the terms of which to be agreed.

3 Remove any associated links to the Article within your website.

4. Undertake not to repeat the Allegations.

2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *866

The Crime Victims' Rights Movement was also able to prod the federal system to recognize victims’ rights. In 1982, Congress
passed the first federal victims’ rights legislation, the Victim and Witness Protection Act, which gave victims the right to make
an impact statement at sentencing and provided expanded restitution. !4 Since then, Congress has passed several acts that
further protected victims’ rights, including the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, '> the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of
1990, 1° the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, !7 the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act
of 1996, '® and the Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997. !° Other federal statutes have been passed to deal with
specialized victim situations, such as child victims and witnesses. 7°

Among these, the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 is worth briefly highlighting. This act purported to create a
comprehensive list of victim's rights in the federal criminal justice process. The act commanded that [a] crime victim has the

n 21

following rights and then listed various rights in the process. Among the [*867] rights were the right to be treated with

fairness and with respect for the victims’ dignity and privacy, 7? to be notified of court proceedings, 7 to confer with [the]

attorney for the Government in the case, 7+

and to attend court proceedings, even if called as a witness, unless the victim's
testimony would be materially affected by hearing other testimony at trial. 75 The statute also directed the Justice
Department to make its best efforts to ensure that victims received their rights. 7° Yet this act never successfully integrated
victims into the federal criminal justice process and was generally regarded as something of a dead letter. Because Congress

passed the CVRA in 2004 to remedy the problems with this law, it is worth briefly reviewing why it was largely unsuccessful.

Curiously, the Victims’ Rights Act was codified in Title 42 of the United States Code - the title dealing with Public Health and
Welfare. As a result, the statute was generally unknown to federal judges and criminal law practitioners. Federal practitioners
reflexively consult Title 18 for guidance on criminal law issues. More prosaically, federal criminal enactments are bound
together in a single West publication - the Federal Criminal Code and Rules. This single publication is carried to court by
prosecutors and defense attorneys and is on the desk of most federal judges. Because West Publishing never included the
Victims’ Rights Act in this book, the statute was essentially unknown even to the most experienced judges and attorneys. The
prime illustration of the ineffectiveness of the Victims’ Rights Act comes from the Oklahoma City bombing case, where victims
were denied rights protected by statute in large part because the rights were not listed in the criminal rules. 77

Because of such problems with the statutory protection of victims' rights, victims advocates decided in 1995 the time was right
to press for a federal constitutional amendment. They argued that the statutory protections could not sufficiently guarantee

“best choice” fish increased an average of 29 percent per week, sales of yellow-tagged “proceed
with caution” seafood declined an average of 27 percent per week, but the sales of the red-tagged
“worst choice” seafood—i.e., the heavily overfished species—remained the same.’ Between
1980 and 2008, sales of pesticides increased 36 percent in the state of California, the birthing
ground of the organic food eco-label.* Despite sporadic instances of such measures as car-
pooling and use of cloth grocery bags in lieu of plastic-or-paper, the demand for oil in the U.S.
has grown 30 percent overall and 5 percent per capita since 1990.’ The positive effect of
idealistic consumers does exist, but it is masked by the growing demand and numbers of other
consumers.

Guilt is a valuable emotion, but it is felt by individuals and therefore motivates only
individuals. Another drawback is that guilt is triggered by an existing value within an individual.
If the value does not exist, there is no guilt and hence no action (e.g., sales for red “worst choice”
seafood remained the same). What if the aim were to promote a value felt by the group but not
necessarily by every individual in the group? Many problems, like most concerning the
environment, are group problems. Perhaps to solve these problems we need a group emotion.
Maybe we need shame.

Shaming, as noted, is unwelcome in regulating personal conduct that does not harm
others. But what about shaming conduct that does harm others? The U.S. National Sex Offender
Registry provides an online database with the names, photographs, and addresses of sex

offenders in every state. In March 2010, Nebraska lawmakers approved a bill that allows the

million barrels per day in 2010.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013576.txt,"Leaving the framework of physical thermodynamic entropies entirely, the
entropy of information was introduced in the context of communication engineering
in electrical and electronic devices. The metaphorical machine for the current age of
entropy, analogous to the role of heat and steam engines in_ classical
thermodynamics, is the computer. Energy in this context is a relatively trivial
property. Ammeters and other monitors of load are unable to discriminate between
a computer actively engaged in encoding and computation or one simply
maintaining its dynamic memory while resting in computational readiness. This
situation is very analogous to the results of early work discussed previously on the
metabolic rates and sources of the whole brain’s energy, oxygen and glucose
metabolism, by National Institutes of Mental Heath’s Seymore Kety and Louis
Sokoloff and the State of Illinois Thudicum Laboratory’s Harold Himwich. Using
whole head arterial-venous, energy-in, energy-out, differences, they could not
demonstrate differences in rates of whole brain metabolism between states in which
the human subjects were engaged in solving mathematical problems or deeply
sleep. In today’s brain imaging research, using a variety of physical reflections of
the brain’s metabolic activity, it is the differences in regional distributions of
metabolic activity that are relatable to subjective and behavioral states, not
differences in total amount of energy expended. In _ graphically coded
representations of the regional metabolism of the brain in action, one or another or
many areas “light up” and others “grow dark” in correlation with changes in thinking,
feeling and action.

The entropy first developed by Claude Shannon was formalized for use in
1948 in what was then called communication theory and now information theory. It
represented a measure of the ambiguity and uncertainty that had the potential for
being resolved by new knowledge. In this context, entropy and information were
obviously complementary descriptors. A message that informs us about which of
ten possibilities should be chosen contains less information than one that informs us
about the proper choice to be made from among a thousand possibilities. The
entropy of communication theory is a measure that is computed on uncertainty. The

information reception capacity of a system is dependent upon the amount of

open. Keep trying. These things build up.”

You don't understand,” I snapped. You don't know him! Maybe he really cares, but
even if he does, it doesn't matter! Things always end up the same. If I mention emotions,
or if I act warm to him, he'll ignore me for a while... and then he'll be cold to me again.
I'm telling you, I've been here before, with Richard. It's a trap.”

Mr. Ambition didn't waver. If you're strong enough, he said simply, then you can walk
into a trap.”

His words made my heart crack, my breath catch. Made me feel like I've forgotten
everything I knew about love.

When I was younger, I thought of my emotional strength like water: an embrace that
could make someone I loved feel lighter. Water is a slow, eroding force that pulls beauty
from the unexpected. Water makes wood into twisted driftwood sculptures; sharp glass
into opaque dim jewels; rocks into soft sand. Water will eventually reveal the heart of
everything it touches. If you let it.

I hadn't thought of myself that way in a long time. I felt like Mr. Ambition was calling
me out, reminding me of who I wanted to be. Maybe I protect myself better, these days.
But vulnerability is not always a bad thing.

I definitely could fall in love with this man, I realized.
You're really amazing, I said, and threw myself on his chest.
He put his arms around me. So are you, he said.

TK OK ok

As a storyteller, I often look back on my relationships and pick out foreshadowing: the
omens. And by now, I recognize the omens even as they're happening... and sometimes I
change my behavior, but usually I don't. Perhaps this state is what they call maturity.

One night while we were out, Mr. Ambition sighed in an offhand way. He seemed tired,
out of sorts. I just want someone to take me on an emotional journey,” he remarked to
me. Then he added, ... No offense.”

I mentioned this to a friend, later: Mr. Ambition says he wants me to take him on an
emotional journey,” I said.

An 'emotional journey’? That shit gets old, though, said my friend. I laughed, and
agreed with him.

Another night, Mr. Ambition mentioned something about enjoying drama. I was with my
best girlfriend at the time; she and I looked at each other. Careful what you wish for, I
said.

My friend said, Yeah, I'm pretty sure Clarisse knows how to create arbitrary amounts of
drama at any time.”

substantial. Consequently, legal counsel and technical

Summary
The Offering
Cushman & Wakefield, Inc., as exclusive advisor, is pleased to offer for sale a remarkable 38.5-
acre development site on the world famous Las Vegas Strip. Situated directly across from the
Mandalay Bay Resort, an investor could obtain permits within approximately nine months to
develop a visionary themed large-scale resort and gaming destination with up to 10,000 hotel
rooms. An approved height allowance of up to 505 feet will make any future development on
the Site the most highly visible on the Strip to the more than 42 million annual visitors travelling
through McCarron International Airport. In addition private aircraft “high roller” terminals
adjacent to the Site create a very unique opportunity to provide exclusive direct jet access points.
Las Vegas gaming revenues, levels of new development, visitor volumes and visitor spending
are all approaching record levels making the timing associated with the development of the Site
extremely compelling.
Las Vegas possesses a unique international appeal that draws an incredible 3.5 million visitors
each and every month. The growth in tourism is only expected to accelerate with McCarran
International Airport anticipated to be the fifth fastest growing airport in the country over the next
10 years with passenger volume projected to reach 55 million. Las Vegas’ growth is expected to
be bolstered by a mix of additional seats by domestic and international carriers through more
flights and larger aircraft and new service from international carriers including nonstop flights
from China within three years. Over 4 million square feet of new convention space and more than
$6 billion of new resort, retail and entertainment developments continue to elevate the overall
“Las Vegas experience”.

The Site
The Site is comprised of 12 parcels totaling approximately 38.475 net acres located at the southeast corner of Las Vegas Boulevard
South and East Mandalay Bay Road on the world famous Las Vegas Strip.

Vegas Boulevard South and a one-story commercial building at 3953 Las Vegas Boulevard South. The former Skyvue development
planned for the northwest portion of the Property received FAA height approvals and was planned for the world’s tallest ferris

and the private jet terminal of the Las Vegas Sands Corp; to the west of the Site are Mandalay Bay Resort Casino and Convention
Center, the Four Seasons Resort and Luxor Resort Casino; to the north of the Site are MGM’s music festival property “The Lot”

Zoning
The Site is zoned H-1. This zoning
provides for full service casino resorts and
is the Strips primary gaming enterprise
designation. Permitted uses include casino
hotels, resort hotels, inns and motels,
apartment rentals and condominiums,
timeshares, public and institutional
buildings, bars, restaurants, retail shops,
and similar uses.
The Site is located within a Mixed-Use
Overlay District. The Clark County Board of
Commissioners approved an ordinance to
the Clark County Code, Title 30 as Chapter
30.48 that established four different
designations for Mixed-Use. The Board
also established a number of Mixed Use
Overlay Districts, with the majority being
along or in close proximity to The Las Vegas
Strip. The Site is within the designation of
MUD-1, the most intense density zoning
primarily located along the Las Vegas Strip
resort corridor. The establishment of the
Mixed Overlay District and the granting of
the land use of MUD-1 make it easier for
properties to receive approvals for mixeduse,
high rise projects.

FAA Approved Height Allowance Up To 505 Feet On The Site
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has provided determination letters for the Site approving a height allowance of 505 feet fronting
Las Vegas Boulevard and decreasing to 354 feet on the eastern portion of the Site. It should be noted that in March 2011 the Clark County
has a Board of County Commissioners unanimously approved the development of the 500 foot observation wheel and retail/convention
space on 10.0 net acres of the Site.

Overview
The Las Vegas Experience
Developed as an entertainment destination, Las
Vegas is driven by a consumer services economy
where “the experience” is its primary commodity.
Las Vegas is one of the most visited tourist
destinations in the United States and it possesses a
unique international appeal that draws a remarkable
3.4 million visitors each month. Identified as the
global capital of entertainment and gaming, it is
the iconic three-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard
known as “the Strip” that draws visitors to Las
Vegas. With 115,000 hotel rooms located on the
Strip, the concentration of tourists is more than
any other metropolitan statistical area in the world.
The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Association
reported 41.1 million visitors in 2014 and project the
total number of visitors to reach a new market high
of 42 million in 2015.
25
Unparalleled Hotel and Resort Inventory
Las Vegas has a larger supply of hotel rooms than any other metropolitan statistical area in the world and in return drives extraordinary
spending demographics. The vast majority of Las Vegas’ lodging supply is located on the Strip, and approximately 76% of all visitors (31
million) to Las Vegas stay in hotels on the Strip each year. Luxurious mega-resorts as well as more moderately priced accommodations are
concentrated on the Strip and in the immediate surrounding area to meet the needs of all segments of the visitor market. A comparable
resort district cannot be found anywhere else.
As summarized in the exhibit below, 17 of the 30 largest resorts in the world are located on the Las Vegas Strip:

4 Million Square Feet of
Convention Space in Development
The $2.5 billion convention center expansion will generate an
increase in demand of 500,000 visitors per year
Indicative of the strong growth in convention demand, in
February 2015 the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority
(LVCVA) acquired the former Riviera hotel located on 23-acres
for $182.5 million. A planned $40 million demolition during
2015-2016 of the former hotel will lay the foundation for a $2.5
billion expansion of the Las Vegas Convention Center, increasing
convention capacity to 5.8 million square feet. The expansion
will transform the current convention center, rebranded as the
Las Vegas Global Business District, and support the demand
growth projected to be an additional 500,000 visitors per year.
Phase One is currently underway and includes developing
750,000 square-feet of new exhibit space and 187,500 squarefeet
of supporting meeting space, renovating and upgrading
the existing facility, incorporating touch screens, faster Internet
speeds, new restaurants and an updated façade. Phase II
includes the expansion onto the former Riviera site from a
current total footprint of 3.2 million square-feet to 5.7 million
square-feet of space, with new street infrastructure and new
centralized transportation hub for the entire city. Additionally,
the expansion project will include development of a new office
park in the neighborhood surrounding the center.
In addition to the LVCVA space, 350,000 square feet of convention
space at Mandalay Bay and 1,000,000 square feet of convention
space at Genting Group’s Resorts World are under construction.

Development on the Strip
With approximately $21 billion in high-profile developments completed since 2008, the Strip has attracted significant investment capital
from both ownership entities that already possess a significant stake in the future success of the Strip and new capital sources seeking to
benefit from Las Vegas’ exceptional long-term fundamentals. Resort and casino ownership is largely consolidated among operators that
are devoted to continuing to increase visitation levels by upgrading the Las Vegas experience.

Gaming Supply and Demand Analysis
Las Vegas is recognized worldwide as a premier gaming destination.
From traditional card and dice games, to slot machines and race and
sports book betting, the casino industry has flourished and evolved
into an international phenomenon. A significant portion of the visitor
revenue generated in the city is attributed to the gaming industry,
which posted $9.6 billion in revenue in 2014.
The initial step in analyzing supply and demand trends within a given
gaming market is to quantify the existing level of gaming inventory.
To quantify gaming supply levels, a review of all competitive gaming
facilities is performed. Once the market’s supply level is known, an
analysis of the demand for gaming facilities is performed.
Unlike traditional economic models of supply and demand, the price variable associated with gaming is largely determined by the consumer.
Gaming is an intangible product: the consumer is purchasing the “experience” and “excitement” casino gaming offers. The price that the
consumer is willing to pay for this experience is known as the “win,” and is quantified on a per-unit basis known as the “win per unit per
day” (WPUPD). Research indicates that the WPUPD, or the price a market can bear for gaming activity, is highly correlated to the level
of available gaming inventory. The actual WPUPD attained by a market, say $100 per gaming position, and provides an indication of the
marketwide demand for gaming. As will be further discussed, these demand levels within a market can be estimated through an analysis of
the actual WPUPD attained by the market. Historical fluctuations in the marketwide WPUPD at various levels of supply can provide insight
into the future demand for gaming. Further impacting the demand for gaming facilities in the market are current and projected trends in
economic and demographic factors such as population base, employment, disposable income levels, and visitation statistics. In addition,
seasonal fluctuations must be taken into consideration when analyzing demand trends.
Once the various demand trends have been identified, a variety of analytical methodologies may be employed to forecast gaming revenue
for an overall market or an individual property.

Gaming Demand Analysis
The win per unit per day (WPUPD) statistic provides the basis for the analysis and projection of table game and gaming device revenues.
WPUPD is calculated by dividing total gaming revenues generated by a particular type of gaming unit by the number of gaming units
available. Overall, the market for gaming devices exhibited high levels of demand and absorption as evidenced by increasing WPUPD and
overall win levels during periods of increasing inventory.
The following exhibit summarizes the strong performance of the Strip gaming market within the industry standard “Casinos earning $72M
and Over”.

Gaming Demand Analysis
Demand for gaming can be classified into four primary sources: the leisure segment, local residents, tour and travel groups and convention
demand.
LEISURE DEMAND
Leisure visitation to Las Vegas is enormous with visitors taking advantage of the year-round favorable climate and multitude of attractions.
The leisure segment utilizes both table games and gaming devices and has a higher propensity to play table games than other segments.
According to the Las Vegas Convention Authority Visitors Profile Study, in 2014 approximately 47% of all visitors mentioned vacation or
pleasure, up significantly from 41% in 2013. Of those polled, 71% of all visitors said they gambled while in Las Vegas with an average
gambling budget of $530.
LOCAL DEMAND
Local demand plays a part in gaming revenue contribution to the Las Vegas market. However, the local segment’s impact on the Las Vegas
Strip is moderate. According to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, 13% of locals gamble on the Strip with 45% gambling at
least once per week and 75% gambling at least once per month.
TOUR AND TRAVEL DEMAND
Las Vegas welcomed a record 41.1 million visitors in 2014, an all time record. Las Vegas tourism generates more than $45 billion in economic
impact for the local economy and supports 376,000 local jobs. Las Vegas is recognized worldwide as a premier gaming destination. From
traditional card and dice games, to slot machines and race and sports book betting, the casino industry has flourished and evolved into
an international phenomenon. A significant portion of the visitor revenue generated in the city is attributed to the gaming industry, which
posted $9.6 billion in revenue in 2014.
CONVENTION DEMAND
Convention demand within the Las Vegas market is significant. Las Vegas was the most popular trade destination (with a 25% market
share of the Trade Show Week 200 Shows in terms of net square footage) and third most popular convention destination in the nation. In
1990, approximately 1.7 million persons attended trade shows and conventions in Las Vegas; In 2014, convention attendance was up to 5.2
million, an increase of 8% annually over the last 25 years. Future convention expansion in demand is anticipated to see these rates of growth
continue for the foreseeable future.
46
Multifamily Housing and Condominium Overview
With an increase in demand for luxury living accommodations in Las Vegas and a 100% sell out of the existing supply of recently delivered
residential units, condominium prices have increased dramatically. The depth of demand far exceeds the amount of new supply forecasted
over the next five years. In addition, the economies of scale associated with new residential, retail, hotel and office development on the Las
Vegas Strip will only elevate the overall appeal of Strip living - and in turn push condominium values higher.

Las Vegas Retail Market
Overview
The Las Vegas Strip has historically outperformed competitive U.S. retail markets and continues to experience very strong absorption of
new construction, low vacancy rates, and an abundance of retail tenants seeking to access high-traffic pedestrian locations. These factors
together with controlled levels of new development will cause significant long-term rent increases across the submarket.
Increasing Levels of Visitor Spending – More than half of the 41 million visitors to Las Vegas each year spend time shopping along the Las
Vegas Strip. Average per capita visitor spending on shopping, dining and entertainment during 2014 was $815. As demonstrated in the
exhibit below, consumers are allocating a larger percentage of their total spending on shopping and entertainment.

Under Construction Entertainment Destinations Drive Retail Demand – In addition to mega projects completed in the past few years such as
City Center and Crystals, new projects under construction surrounding the Site will significantly increase pedestrian traffic in the immediate
area. Situated within two block of the Site, MGM’s The Lot, AEG’s The Arena, and Mandalay Bay’s Convention Center expansion will draw
hundreds of thousands of pedestrian foot traffic to the immediate area. Additionally, there are over 450,000 square feet of new lifestyle retail
in planning at Tropicana and Las Vegas Boulevard with the Shops at Tropicana and Excalibur.
Expanding Pedestrian Synergies Between New Retail – The Crystals at CityCenter to the north and the Town Square Las Vegas to the south
have expanded the retail inventory within three blocks of the Site. Each of the retail projects is a Strip-accessible development, encouraging
greater levels of pedestrian traffic along Las Vegas Boulevard. Retailers located within these two projects include: Apple, H&M, Prada,
Gucci, Versace, Tom Ford, Mikimoto, Balenciaga, Wolfgang Puck (2 locations), Katana, Louis Vuitton, Zegna, Rolex and Tiffany & Co.
Strong Residential Demand on the Strip Resort Corridor – The Resort Corridor contains the largest concentration of recent vertical high-rise
developments in the nation with approximately 10,000 new residences within one mile of the Site. The amenity base on Las Vegas Boulevard
has established the Strip as a preferred location for residents.

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026396.txt,"I found Noam's hypothesis very compelling in the past. I still think that the idea that language is somehow a
cultural or social invention of our species is wrong. But I think that there is a chance (we don't know that, but
it seems to most promising hypothesis IMHO) that the difference between humans and apes is not a very
intricate special circuit, but genetically simple developmental switches. The bootstrapping of cognition works
layer by layer during the first 20 years of our life. Each layer takes between a few months and a few years to
train in humans. While a layer is learned, there is not much going on in the higher layers yet, and after the low
level learning is finished, it does not change very much. This leads to the characteristic bursts in child
development, that have famously been described by Piaget.

The first few layers are simple perceptual stuff, the last ones learn social structure and self-in-society. The
switching works with something like a genetic clock, very slowly in humans, but much more quickly in other
apes, and very fast in small mammals. As a result, human children take nine months before their brains are
mature enough to crawl, and more than a year before they can walk. Many African populations are quite a bit
faster. In the US, black children outperform white children in motor development, even in very poor and
socially disadvantaged households, but they lag behind (and never catch up) in cognitive development even
after controlling for family income.

Gorillas can crawl after 2 months, and build their own nests after 2.5 years. They leave their mothers at 3-4
years. Human children are pretty much useless during the first 10-12 years, but during each phase, their brains
have the opportunity to encounter many times as much training data as a gorilla brain. Humans are literally
smarter on every level, and because the abilities of the higher levels depend on those of the lower levels, they
can perform abstractions that mature gorillas will never learn, no matter how much we try to train them.

The second set of mechanisms is in the motivational system. Motivation tells the brain what to pay attention
to, by giving reward and punishment. If a brain does not get much reward for solving puzzles, the individual
will find mathematics very boring and won't learn much of it. Ifa brain gets lots of rewards for discovering
other people's intentions, it will learn a lot of social cognition.

Language might be the result of three things that are different in humans:

- extended training periods per layer (after the respective layer is done, it is difficult to learn a new set of
phonemes or the first language)

- more layers

- different internal rewards. Perhaps the reward for learning grammatical structure is the same that makes us
like music. Our brains may enjoy learning compositional regular structure, and they enjoy making themselves
understood, and everything else is something the universal cortical learning figures out on its own.

This is a hypothesis that is shared by a growing number of people these days. In humans, it is reflected for
instance by the fact that races with faster motor development have lower IQ. (In individuals of the same
group, slower development often indicates defects, of course.)

Another support comes from machine learning: we find that the same learning functions can learn visual and
auditory pattern recognition, and even end-to-end-learning. Google has built automatic image recognition into
their current photo app:
http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/07/01/google-mistakenly-tags-black-people-as-gorillas-showing-limits-of-

algorithms/

The state of the art in research can do better than that: it can begin to Imagine things. I.e. when the
experimenter asks the system to dream what a certain object looks like, the system can produce a somewhat
compelling image, which indicates that it is indeed learning visual structure. This stuff is something nobody
could do a few months ago:

“Alessi Depo. Tr.”) Alessi testified that he saw “many celebrities” at the house... [including] a
very famous lawyer[] that I’m sure you know, Alan Dershowitz, who spend [sic] at the house a
couple times.” (Alessi Depo. Tr. 70, 71.) However, Alessi made no allegations of improprieties
against any of these individuals. Jane Doe #3 asks the Court to infer that because Prof.
Dershowitz was at his client’s home, he must have participated in nefarious activities. In fact,
Prof. Dershowitz’s friendship with Epstein consisted of the exchange of academic and
intellectual ideas. At most, Alessi testified that Prof. Dershowitz visited Epstein’s home and
received a massage from an adult massage therapist, which “was a treat for everybody” at the
Epstein home. (Id. at 74) (“Q. Did [Dershowitz] have massages sometimes when he was there?
A. Yes. A massage was like a treat for everybody. If they want it, we call the massage and they
have a massage.”) Alessi explains that he was referring to massages performed by adult
massage therapists. (Id. at 184) (“Q. All right. And if I understood your testimony is, the ones
the — that is, of the massage therapists as you’ve just described [a hundred, 200 different massage
therapists], you saw some men? A. Yes. Q. You saw more women? A. Yes. Q. And all of the
women, at least from your viewpoint, were 18, 19 or older? A. Yes.”)’

Messrs. Alessi and Rodriguez did not allege that Prof. Dershowitz received a massage
from any underage females, had any physical contact whatsoever with any underage females, or
witnessed anyone engaging in any inappropriate behavior with any underage females.
Additionally, despite their allegations to the contrary, it is clear that previous testimony from
Rodriguez and Alessi does not corroborate Jane Doe #3’s baseless and utterly false affidavit.

(DE 291-1.)

’TIn fact, the only massage Prof. Dershowitz ever received at any of Epstein’s homes was from a
professional massage therapist who was in her 30’s or 40s.

exported concept of the nation-state.

Following World War II, as European colonialism waned, the US
assumed a more significant role in the Middle East. US foreign policy
was driven primarily by oil interests, the protection of Israel and
resistance to Soviet aggression. To prevent the region from dissolving
in sectarian conflict, the US established a series of autocracies. The
campaign included restoring the Shah of Iran to the throne after the
democratically elected Mosaddegh regime nationalized oil fields, and
supporting for the Baathist overthrow of the Qasim government in
Iraq, which gave rise to Saddam Hussein.

Following the end of the Cold War, America’s foreign policy gravitated
toward nation building, and the widespread promotion of democracy
and human rights abroad. However, an iron fisted policies the
strongmen imposed to remain in power conflicted with the moral
endeavor to curate democracy afar. Hence, America’s crusade
undermined its original goals by threatening the same autocratic
regimes the US had helped establish.

As the leaders the West once championed are toppled one by one, the
boot-prints of Western Power are clearly visible. Regimes once
supported by the US have fallen, marking the failure of embrace and
abandon. In Egypt, Mubarak was in, then deserted. In Iraq, Hussein
was in, then deposed. In Libya, Gaddafi was in, then overthrown with
US support. In Syria with Assad, it was the same scenario. The
instability created by contradictory Western interests has invited far
worse atrocities by the new regimes than the crimes perpetrated by the
previous order. The massacres in Syria and Iraq are obvious, bitter
examples.

Filling the void are a multitude of warring sectarian groups from ISIS
to Syrian rebels. The factions each generally fight under their own flag
of political Islam. The rise of Islamic factions battling for territory is a

Moshe Hoffman , Erez Yoeli , and Carlos David Navarrete
Introduction
Consider the following puzzling aspects of our morality:
1. Many of us share the view that one should not use people, even if it benefits them
to be used, as Kant intoned in his second formulation of the categorical imperative:
“Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or
in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the
same time as an end” (Kant, 1997 ). Consider dwarf tossing, where dwarfs wearing
protective padding are thrown for amusement, usually at a party or pub. It is
viewed as a violation of dwarfs’ basic dignity to use them as a means for amusement,
even though dwarves willingly engage in the activity for economic gain.
Many jurisdictions ban dwarf tossing on the grounds that the activity violates
dwarfs’ basic human rights, and these laws have withstood lawsuits raised by
dwarfs suing over the loss of employment (!).
2. Charitable giving is considered virtuous, but little attention is paid to how just
the cause or efficient the charity. For example, Jewish and Christian traditions
advocate giving 10 % of one’s income to charity, but make no mention of the
importance of evaluating the cause or avoiding wasteful charities. The intuition
that giving to charity is a moral good regardless of efficacy results in the persistence
of numerous inefficient and corrupt charities. For example, the Wishing
Well Foundation has, for nearly a decade, ranked as one of CharityNavigator.

com’s most inefficient charities. Yet its mission of fulfilling wishes by children
with terminal illnesses is identical to that of the more efficient Make-A-Wish
Foundation. Worse yet, scams masquerading as charities persist. One man operating
as The US Navy Veteran’s Association collected over 100 million dollars—
over 7 years!—before anyone bothered to investigate the charity.
3. In every culture and age, injunctions against murder have existed. If there is one
thing much of humanity seems to agree on, it’s that ending the life of another
without just cause which is among the worst of moral violations. Yet cultures
don’t consider the loss of useful life years in their definition, even though it is
relevant to the measure of harm done by the murder. Why is our morality so
much more sensitive to whether a life was lost than to how much life was lost?
There are numerous other examples of how our moral intuitions appear to be rife
with logical inconsistencies. In this chapter, we use game theory to provide insight
on a range of moral puzzles similar to the puzzles described above.
What Is Game Theory and Why Is It Relevant?
In this section , we review the defi nition of a game , and of a Nash equilibrium , then
discuss how evolution and learning processes would yield moral intuitions consistent
with Nash equilibria .
Game theory is a tool for the analysis of social interactions. In a game, the payoff
to each player depends on their actions, as well as the actions of others. Consider
the Prisoner’s Dilemma (Chammah & Rapoport, 1965 ; see Fig. 1 ), a model that
captures the paradox of cooperation. Each of two players chooses whether to cooperate
or to defect. Cooperating reduces a player’s payoff by c > 0 while increasing
the other’s payoffs by b> c. Players could be vampire bats with the option of
sharing blood, or firms with the option of letting each other use their databases, or
premed students deciding whether to take the time to help one another to study. The
payoffs, b and c , may represent likelihood of surviving and leaving offspring, profits,
or chance of getting into a good medical school.
Solutions to such games are analyzed using the concept of a Nash equilibrium 1 —
a specification of each player’s action such that no player can increase his payoff by
deviating unilaterally. In the Prisoner’s Dilemma, the only Nash equilibrium is for
neither player to cooperate, since regardless of what the other player does, cooperation
reduces one’s own payoff.
1
Note that we focus on the concept of Nash equilibrium in this chapter and not evolutionary stable
strategy (ESS), a refinement of Nash that might be more familiar to an evolutionary audience. ESS
are the Nash equilibria that are most relevant in evolutionary contexts. However, ESS is not well
defined in many of our games, so we will focus on the insights garnered from Nash and directly
discuss evolutionary dynamics when appropriate.
Morality Games
291
Fig. 1 The Prisoner’s
Dilemma. Player 1’s available
strategies (C and D, which
stand for cooperate and
defect, respectively) are
represented as rows . Player
2’s available strategies (also
C and D) are represented as
columns . Player 1’s payoffs
are represented at the
intersection of each row and
column. For example, if
player 1 plays D and player 2
plays C, player 1’s payoff is
b. The Nash equilibrium of
the game is (D, D). It is
indicated with a circle
Game theory has traditionally been applied in situations where players are rational
decision makers who deliberately maximize their payoffs, such as pricing
decisions of firms (Tirole, 1988 ) or bidding in auctions (Milgrom & Weber, 1982 ).
In these contexts, behavior is expected to be consistent with a Nash equilibrium,
otherwise one of the agents—who are actively deliberating about what to do—
would realize she could benefit from deviating from the prescribed strategy.
However, game theory also applies to evolutionary and learning processes, where
agents do not deliberately choose their behavior in the game, but play according to
strategies with which they are born, imitate, or otherwise learn. Agents play a game
and then “reproduce” based on their payoffs, where reproduction represents offspring,
imitation, or learning. The new generation then play the game, and so on. In
such settings, if a mutant does better (mutation can be genetic or can happen when
agents experiment), then she is more likely to reproduce or her behavior imitated or
reinforced, causing the behavior to spread. This intuition is formalized using models
of evolutionary dynamics (e.g., Nowak, 2006 ).
The key result for evolutionary dynamic models is that, except under extreme
conditions, behavior converges to Nash equilibria. This result rests on one simple,
noncontroversial assumption shared by all evolutionary dynamics: Behaviors that
are relatively successful will increase in frequency. Based on this logic, game theory
models have been fruitfully applied in biological contexts to explain phenomena
such as animal sex ratios (Fisher, 1958 ), territoriality (Smith & Price, 1973 ), cooperation
(Trivers, 1971 ), sexual displays (Zahavi, 1975 ), and parent–offspring conflict
(Trivers, 1974 ). More recently, evolutionary dynamic models have been applied
in human contexts where conscious deliberation is believed to not play an important
role, such as in the adoption of religious rituals (Sosis & Alcorta, 2003 ), in the
expression and experience of emotion (Frank, 1988 ; Winter, 2014 ), and in the use
of indirect speech (Pinker, Nowak, & Lee, 2008 ).
292
M. Hoffman et al.
Crucially for this chapter, because our behaviors are mediated by moral intuitions
and ideologies, if our moral behaviors converge to Nash, so must the intuitions and
ideologies that motivate them. The resulting intuitions and ideologies will bear
the signature of their game theoretic origins, and this signature will lend clarity on
the puzzling, counterintuitive, and otherwise hard-to-explain features of our moral
intuitions, as exemplified by our motivating examples.
In order for game theory to be relevant to understanding our moral intuitions and
ideologies, we need only the following simple assumption: Moral intuitions and
ideologies that lead to higher payoffs become more frequent . This assumption can
be met if moral intuitions that yield higher payoffs are held more tenaciously, are
more likely to be imitated, or are genetically encoded. For example, if every time
you transgress by commission you are punished, but every time you transgress by
omission you are not, you will start to intuit that commission is worse than
omission.
Rights and the Hawk–Dove Game
In this section we will argue that just as the Hawk –Dove model explains animal territoriality
(Maynard Smith & Price, 1973 , to be reviewed shortly ), the Hawk –Dove
model sheds light onto our sense of rights (Descioli & Karpoff, 2014 ; Gintis, 2007 ;
Myerson, 2004 ).
Let us begin by asking the following question (Myerson, 2004 ): “Why [does] a
passenger pay a taxi driver after getting out of the cab in a city where she is visiting
for one day, not expecting to return?” If the cabby complains to the authorities, the
passenger could plausibly claim that she had paid in cash. The answer, of course, is
that the cabby would feel that the money the passenger withheld was his—that he
had a right to be paid for his service—and get angry, perhaps making a scene or
even starting a fight. Likewise, if the passenger did in fact pay, but the cabby
demanded money a second time, the passenger would similarly be infuriated. This
example illustrates that people have powerful intuitions regarding rightful ownership.
In this section, we explore what the Hawk – Dove game can teach us about our
sense of property rights.
The reader is likely familiar with the Hawk – Dove game, a model of disputes
over contested resources. In the Hawk – Dove game, each player decides whether to
fight over a resource or to acquiesce (i.e. play Hawk or Dove). If one fights and the
other does not, the fighter gets the resource, worth v . If both fight, each pays a cost
c and split the resource. That is, each gets v/2- c. If neither fights, they split the
resource and get v /2. As long as v/2 < c, then in any stable Nash equilibrium, one
player fights and the other acquiesces. That is, if one player expects the other to
fight, she is better off acquiescing, and vice versa (see Fig. 2 ).
Crucially, it is not just a Nash equilibrium for one player to always play Hawk
and the other to always play Dove. It is also an equilibrium for both players to condition
whether they play Hawk on an uncorrelated asymmetry —a cue or event that
Morality Games
293
Fig. 2 The Hawk–Dove
game. The Nash equilibria of
the game are circled
does not necessarily affect the payoffs, but does distinguish between the players,
such as who arrived at the territory first or who built the object. If one conditions on
the event (say, plays Hawk when she arrives first), then it is optimal for the other to
condition on the event (to play Dove when the other arrives first).
As our reader is likely aware, this was the logic provided by Maynard Smith to
explain animal territoriality—why animals behave aggressively to defend territory
that they have arrived at first, even if incumbency does not provide a defensive
advantage and even when facing a more formidable intruder. Over the years, evidence
has amassed to support Maynard Smith’s explanation, such as experimental
manipulation of which animal arrives first (Davies, 1978 ; Sigg & Falett, 1985 ).
Like other animals, we condition how aggressively we defend a resource on
whether we arrive first. Because our behaviors are motivated by beliefs, we are also
more likely to believe that the resource is “ours” when we arrive first. Studies have
shown these effects with children’s judgments of ownership, in ethnographies of
prelegal societies, and in computer games. In one such illustration, DeScioli and
Wilson ( 2011 ) had research subjects play a computer game in which they contested
a berry patch. Subjects who ended up keeping control of the patch usually arrived
first, and this determined the outcome more often than differences in fighting ability
in the game.
This sense of ownership is codified in our legal systems, as illustrated by the quip
“possession is 9/10ths of the law,” and in a study involving famous legal property
cases conducted by Descioli and Karpoff ( 2014 ). In a survey, these researchers
asked participants to identify the rightful owner of a lost item, after reading vignettes
based on famous property rights legal cases. Participants consistently identified the
possessor of the found item as its rightful owner (as the judges had at the time of the
case). This sense of ownership is also codified in our philosophical tradition, e.g., in
Locke ( 1988 ), who found property rights in initial possession. Note that, as has also
been found in animals, possession extends to objects on one’s land: In DeScioli and
294
M. Hoffman et al.
Karpoff’s survey, another dictate of participants’ (and the judges’) property rights
intuitions was who owned the land on which the lost item was found.
Also like animals, our sense of property rights is influenced by who created or
invested in the resource, another uncorrelated asymmetry. In locales that sometimes
grant property rights to squatters—individuals who occupy lands others have purchased—a
key determinant of whether the squatters are granted the land is whether
they have invested in it (Cone vs. West Virginia Pulp & Paper Co., 1947 ; Neuwirth,
2005 ). Locke also intuited that investment in land is part of what makes it ours:
In Second Treatise on Civil Government (1689), Locke wrote, “everyman has a
property in his person; this nobody has a right to but himself. The labor of his body
and the work of his hand, we may say, are properly his.”
If the Hawk – Dove model underlies our sense of property rights, we would expect
to see psychological mechanisms that motivate us to feel entitled to an object when
we possess it or have invested in it. Here are three such mechanisms, which can be
seen by reinterpreting some well-documented “biases” in the behavioral economics
literature. The first such bias is the endowment effect : We value items more if we are
in possession of them. The endowment effect has been documented in dozens of
experiments, where subjects are randomly given an item (mug, pen, etc.) and
subsequently state that they are willing to sell the mug for much more than those
who were not given the mug are willing to pay (Kahneman, Knetsch, & Thaler,
1990 ). In the behavioral economics literature, the endowment effect has sometimes
been explained by loss aversion, which is when we are harmed more by a loss than
we benefit from an equivalent gain. However, the source of loss aversion is not
questioned or explained. When it is, loss aversion is also readily explained by the
Hawk – Dove game (Gintis, 2007 ).
A second bias that also fits the Hawk – Dove model is the IKEA effect : Our valuation
of an object is influenced by whether we have developed or built the resource.
The IKEA effect has been documented by asking people how much they would pay
for items like Lego structures or IKEA furniture after randomly being assigned to
build them or receive them pre-built. Subjects are willing to pay more for items they
build themselves.
A third such bias that fits the Hawk – Dove model is the sunk cost fallacy (Mankiw,
2007 ; Thaler, 1980 ), which leads us to “throw good money after bad” when we
invest in ventures simply because we have already put so much effort into them,
arguably because our prior efforts lead us to value those ventures more.
Possession and past investment are not the only uncorrelated asymmetries that
can dictate rights. Rights can be dictated by a history of agreements, as happens
when one party sells another deed to a house or car, or, as in our taxicab example,
by whether a service was provided. There are also countless examples in which
rights were determined by perhaps unfair or arbitrary characteristics such as race
and sex: Black Americans were expected to give up their seat for Whites in the Jim
Crow South and women to hand over their earnings or property to their husbands
throughout the ages.
Hawk – Dove is not just a post hoc explanation for our sense of rights; it also leads
to the following novel insight: We can formally characterize the properties that
Morality Games
295
uncorrelated asymmetries must have. This requires a bit more game theory to illustrate;
the logic is detailed in the section on categorical distinctions but the implications
are straightforward: Uncorrelated asymmetries must be discrete (as in who
arrived first or whether someone has African ancestry) and cannot be continuous
(who is stronger, whether someone has darker skin). Indeed, we challenge the reader
to identify a case where our sense of rights depends on surpassing a threshold in a
continuous variable (stronger than? darker than?). More generally, an asymmetry
must have the characteristic that, when it occurs, every observer believes it occurred
with a sufficiently high probability, where the exact level of confidence is determined
by the payoffs of the game. This is true of public, explicit speech and handshakes,
but not innuendos or rumors. (Formally, explicit speech and handshakes
induce what game theorists term common p-beliefs.)
The Hawk – Dove explanation of our sense of rights also gives useful clarity on
when there will be conflict. Conflict will arise if both players receive opposing signals
regarding the uncorrelated asymmetry, such as two individuals each believing
they arrived first, or when there are two uncorrelated asymmetries that point in
conflicting directions, such as when one person invested more and the other arrived
first. The former source of conflict appears to be the case in the Israeli–Palestinian
conflict. Indeed, both sides pour great resources into demonstrating their early
possession, especially Israel, through investments in and public displays of archeology
and history. The latter source of conflict appears to be the case in many of the
contested legal disputes in the study by DeScioli and Karpoff ( 2014 ) mentioned
above. An example is one person finds an object on another’s land. Indeed, this turns
out to be a source of many legal conflicts over property rights, and a rich legal tradition
has developed to assign precedence to one uncorrelated asymmetry over another
(Descioli & Karpoff, 2014 ). As usual, we see similar behavior in animals in studies
that provide empirical support for Maynard Smith’s model for animal territoriality:
When two animals are each given the impression they arrived first by, for example,
clever use of mirrors, a fight ensues (Davies, 1978 ).
Authentic Altruism, Motives, and the Envelope Game
In this section , we present a simple extension of the Repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma
to explain why morality depends not just on what people do but also what they think
or consider .
In the Repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma and other models of cooperation, players
judge others by their actions—whether they cooperate or defect. However, we not
only care about whether others cooperate but also about their decision-making process:
We place more trust in cooperators who never even considered defecting. To
quote Kant, “In law a man is guilty when he violates the rights of others. In ethics
he is guilty if he only thinks of doing so.”
The Envelope Game (Fig. 3 ) models why we care about thoughts and considerations
and not just actions (Hoffman, Yoeli, & Nowak, 2015 ). The Envelope Game
296
M. Hoffman et al.
Fig. 3 A single stage of the Envelope Game
is a repeated game with two players. In each round, player 1 receives a sealed envelope,
which contains a card stating the costs of cooperation (high temptation to
defect vs. low temptation to defect). The temptation is assigned randomly and is
usually low. Player 1 can choose to look inside the envelope and thus find out the
magnitude of the temptation or choose not to look. Then player 1 decides to cooperate
or to defect. Subsequently, player 2 can either continue to the next round or end
the game. As in the Repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma, the interaction repeats with a
given likelihood, and if it does, an envelope is stuffed with a new card and presented
to player 1, etc.
In this model, as long as temptations are rare, large, and harmful to player 2, it is
a Nash equilibrium for player 1 to “cooperate without looking” in the envelope and
for player 2 to continue if and only if player 1 has cooperated and not looked. We
refer to this as the cooperate without looking (CWOL) equilibrium. 2 This equilibrium
emerges in agent-based simulations of evolution and learning processes. 3 Notice
that if player 1 could not avoid looking inside the envelope, or player 2 could not
observe whether player 1 looked, there would not be a cooperative equilibrium
since player 1 would benefit by deviating to defection in the face of large temptations.
Not looking permits cooperative equilibria in the face of large temptations.
The Envelope Game is meant to capture the essential features of many interesting
aspects of our morality, as described next.
Authentic Altruism . Many have asked whether “[doing good is] always and exclusively
motivated by the prospect of some benefit for ourselves, however subtle”
(Batson, 2014 ), for example, the conscious anticipation of feeling good (Andreoni,
2
Technically, the conditions under which we expect players to avoid looking and attend to looking
are ch > a /(1 − w ) > c lp + ch (1 − p ) and bp + d (1 − p ) < 0), where ch and cl are the magnitudes of the
high and low temptations, respectively; p is the likelihood of the low temptation; a /(1 − w ) is the
value of a repeated, cooperative interaction to player 1; and bp + d (1 − p ) is the expected payoff to
player 2 if player 1 only cooperates when the temptation is low.
3
The simulations employ numerical estimation of the replicator dynamics for a limited strategy
space: cooperate without looking, cooperate with looking, look and cooperate only when the temptation
is low, and always defect for player 1, and end if player 1 looks, end if player 1 defects, and
always end for player 2.
Morality Games
297
1990 ), avoidance of guilt (Cain, Dana, & Newman, 2014 ; Dana, Cain, & Dawes,
2006 ; DellaVigna, List, & Malmendier, 2012 ), anticipation of reputational benefits
or reciprocity (as Plato’s Glaucon suggests, when he proffers that even a pious man
would do evil if given a ring that makes him invisible; Trivers, 1971 ). At the extreme,
this amounts to asking if saintly individuals such as Gandhi or Mother Teresa were
motivated thus, or if they were “authentic” altruists who did good without anticipating
any reward and would be altruistic even in the absence of such rewards.
Certainly, religions advocate doing good for the “right” reasons. In the Gospel of
Matthew, Chapter 6, Jesus advocates, “Be careful not to practice your righteousness
in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your
Father in heaven,” after which he adds, “But when you give to the needy, do not let
your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in
secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.”
The Envelope Game suggests authentic altruism is indeed possible: By focusing
entirely on the benefits to others and ignoring the benefits to themselves, authentic
altruists are trusted more, and the benefits from this trust outweigh the risk of, for
example, dying a martyr’s death. Moreover, this model helps explain why we think
so highly of authentic altruists, as compared to others who do good, but with an
ulterior motive (consider, as an example, the mockery Sean Penn has faced for
showing up at disaster sites such as Haiti and Katrina with a photographer in tow).
Principles . Why do we like people who are “principled” and not those who are
“strategic”? For example, we trust candidates for political office whose policies are
the result of their convictions and are consistent over time and distrust those whose
policies are carefully constructed in consultation with their pollsters and who “flipflop”
in response to public opinion (as caricatured by the infamous 2004 Republican
presidential campaign television ad showing John Kerry windsurfing and tacking
from one direction to another). CWOL offers the following potential explanation.
Someone who is strategic considers the costs and benefits to themselves of every
decision and will defect when faced with a large temptation, whereas someone who
is guided by principles is less sensitive to the costs and benefits are to themselves
and thus less likely to defect. Imagine our flip-flopping politician was once against
gay marriage but supports it now that it is popular. This indicates the politician is
unlikely to fight for the cause if it later becomes unpopular with constituents or risks
losing a big donor. Moreover, this model may help explain why ideologues that are
wholly devoted to a cause (e.g., Hitler, Martin Luther King, and Gandhi) are able to
attract so many followers.
Don ’t Use People . Recall Kant’s second formulation of the categorical imperative:
“Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or
in the person of any other, never simply as a means but always at the same time as
an end.” In thinking this through, let’s again consider dwarf tossing. Many see it as
a violation of dwarfs’ basic dignity to use them as a means for amusement, even
though they willingly engage in the activity for economic gain. Our aversion to
using people may explain many important aspects of our moral intuitions, such as
298
M. Hoffman et al.
why we judge torture as worse than imprisonment or punishment (torture is harming
someone as a means to obtaining information) and perhaps one of the (many) reasons
we oppose prostitution (prostitution is having sex with someone as a means to
obtaining money). The Envelope Game clarifies the function of adhering to this
maxim. Whereas those who treat someone well as means to an end would also
mistreat them if expedient, those who treat someone well as an end can be trusted
not to mistreat them when expedient.
Attention to Motives . The previous two applications are examples of a more general
phenomenon: that we judge the moral worth of an action based on the motivation
of the actor, as argued by deontological ethicists, but contested by
consequentialists. The deontological argument is famously invoked by Kant:
“Action from duty has its moral worth not in the purpose to be attained by it but in
the maxim in accordance with which it is decided upon, and therefore does not
depend upon the realization of the object of the action but merely upon the principle
of volition in accordance with which the action is done without regard for any object
of the faculty of desire” (Kant, 1997 ). These applications illustrate that we attend to
motives because they provide valuable information on whether the actor can be
trusted to treat others well even when it is not in her interest.
Altruism Without Prospect of Reciprocation . CWOL also helps explain why people
cooperate in contexts where there is no possibility of reciprocation, such as in
one-shot anonymous laboratory experiments like the dictator game (Fehr &
Fischbacher, 2003 ), as well as when performing heroic and dangerous acts. Consider
soldiers who throw themselves on a grenade to save their compatriots or stories like
that of Liviu Librescu, a professor at the University of Virginia and a Holocaust survivor,
who saved his students during a school shooting. When he heard the shooter
coming toward his classroom, Librescu stood behind the door to his classroom,
expecting that when the shooter tried to shoot through the door, it would kill him and
his dead body would block the door. Mr. Librescu, clearly, did not expect this act to
be reciprocated. Such examples have been used as evidence for group selection
(Wilson, 2006 ), but can be explained by individuals “not looking” at the chance of
future reciprocation. Consistent with this interpretation, cooperation during extreme
acts of altruism is more likely to be intuitive than deliberative (Rand & Epstein,
2014 ), and those who cooperate without considering the prospect of reciprocation
are more trusted (Critcher, Inbar, & Pizarro, 2013 ). We also predict that people are
more likely to cooperate intuitively when they know they are being observed.
The Omission–Commission Distinction
and Higher-Order Beliefs
We explain the omission –commission distinction and the means–by-product distinction
by arguing that these moral intuitions evolved in contexts where punishment is
coordinated. Then , even when intentions are clear to one witness for omissions and
by-products , a witness will think intentions are less clear to the other witnesses .
Morality Games
299
Why don’t we consider it murder to let someone die that we could have easily
saved? For example, we sometimes treat ourselves to a nice meal at a fancy restaurant
rather than donating the cost of that meal to a charity that fights deadly diseases.
This extreme example illustrates a general phenomenon: that people have a tendency
to assess harmful commissions (actions such as killing someone) as worse, or
more morally reprehensible, than equally harmful omissions (inactions such as letting
someone die). Examples of this distinction abound, in ethics (we assess withholding
the truth as less wrong than lying (Spranca, Minsk, & Baron, 1991 )), in law
(it is legal to turn off a patient’s life support and let the patient die, as long as one
has the consent of the patient’s family; however, it is illegal to assist the patient in
committing suicide even with the family’s consent), and in international relations.
For example, consider the Struma, a boat carrying Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi
persecution in 1942. En route to Palestine, the ship’s engine failed, and it was towed
to a nearby port in Turkey. At the behest of the British authorities then in control of
Palestine, passengers were denied permission to disembark and find their way to
Palestine by land. For weeks, the ship sat at port. Passengers were brought only
minimal supplies, and their requests for safe haven were repeatedly denied by the
British and others. Finally, the ship was towed to known hostile waters in the Black
Sea, where it was torpedoed by a Russian submarine almost immediately, killing
791 of 792 passengers. Crucially, though, the British did not torpedo the ship themselves
or otherwise execute passengers—an act of commission that they and their
superiors would undoubtedly have found morally reprehensible.
Why do we distinguish between transgressions of omission and commission? To
address this question, we present a simple game theory model based on the insight
by DeScioli, Bruening, and Kurzban ( 2011 ). The intuition can be summarized in
four steps:
1. We note that moral condemnation motivates us to punish transgressors. Such
punishment is potentially costly, e.g., due to the risk of retaliation. We expect
people to learn or evolve to morally condemn only when such costs are worth
paying.
2. Moral condemnation can be less costly when others also condemn, perhaps
because the risk of retaliation is diffused, because some sanctions do not work
unless universally enforced or, worse, because others may sanction individuals
they believe wrongly sanctioned. This can be modeled using any game with
multiple Nash equilibria, including the Repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma and the
Side- Taking Game. The Coordination Game is the simplest game with multiple
equilibria, so we present this game to convey the basic intuition. In the
Coordination Game, there are two players who each simultaneously choose
between two actions, say punish and don’t punish. The key assumption is that
each player prefers to do what she expects the other to do, which can be captured
by assuming each receives a if they both punish, d if neither punish, b < d if one
punishes and the other does not, and c < a if one does not punish while the other
does (Fig. 4 ).
3. Transgressions of omission that are intended are difficult to distinguish from
unintended transgression, as is the case when perpetrators are simply not paying
300
M. Hoffman et al.
Fig. 4 The Coordination
Game. In our applications, A
stands for punish, and B
stands for don’t punish
attention or do not have enough time to react with better judgment (DeScioli
et al., 2011 ). Relative to the example of the tennis player with the allergy
described above, it is usually hard to distinguish between a competitor who does
not notice his opponent orders the dish with the allergen versus one who notices
but does not care. In contrast, transgressions of commission must be intended
almost by definition.
4. Suppose the witness knows an omission was intentional: In the above example,
the tennis player’s opponent’s allergy is widely known, and the witness saw the
player watch his opponent order the offending dish, had time to react, thought
about it, but did not to say anything. The witness suspects that others do not
know the competitor was aware his opponent ordered the dish, but believes the
tennis player should be condemned for purposely withholding information from
his competitor. However, since the witness does not wish to be the sole condemner,
she is unlikely to condemn. In contrast, when a witness observes a transgression
of commission (e.g., the player recommends the dish), the witness is
relatively confident that others present interpret the transgression as purposely
harmful, since his recommendation reveals that the player was obviously paying
attention and therefore intended to harm his opponent. So, if all other individuals
present condemn the tennis player when they observe the commission, each does
not anticipate being the sole condemner.
For the above result to hold, all that is needed is the following: (1) The more the costs
of punishment decrease, the more others punish and (2) omissions are usually unintended
(Dalkiran, Hoffman, Paturi, Ricketts, & Vattani, 2012 ; Hoffman et al., 2015 ). 4
4
In fact, even if one knows that others know that the transgression was intended, omission will still
be judged as less wrong, since the transgression still won’t create what game theorists call common
p-belief, which is required for an event to influence behavior in a game with multiple equilibria.
Morality Games
301
This explanation for the omission–commission distinction leads to two novel
predictions: First, for judgments and emotions not evolved to motivate witnesses to
punishment but to, say, motivate witnesses to avoid dangerous partners (such as the
emotion of fear; in contrast to anger or moral disgust), the omission–commission
distinction is expected to be weaker or disappear altogether. Second, for transgressions
of omission that, without any private information, can be presumed intentional
(such as a mother who allows her child to go hungry or a person who does not give
to a charity after being explicitly asked), we would not expect much of an omission–commission
distinction in moral condemnation.
As with the all models discussed in this chapter, the game theoretic explanation
for the omission–commission distinction does not rest on rational, conscious, strategic
calculation. In fact, in this particular case, all reasonable evolutionary dynamic
models lead away from punishing omissions. The fact that the above results do not
rest on rational, strategic thinking is particularly important in this setting since there
is evidence that the distinction between omissions and commissions is not determined
deliberately but rather intuitively (Cushman, Young, & Hauser, 2006 ) and
appears to be evolved (DeScioli et al., 2011 ) and that consciously considering what
others believe is an onerous process (Camerer, 2003 ; Epley, Keysar, Van Boven, &
Gilovich, 2004 ; Hedden & Zhang, 2002 ).
This same model can explain several other puzzling aspects of our morality. The
first is the means –by-product distinction. This distinction has been documented in
studies that ask respondents to judge the following variants of the classic “trolley”
problem. In the standard trolley “switch” case (Foot, 1967), a runaway trolley is
hurtling toward a group of five people. To prevent their deaths, the trolley must be
switched onto a side track where it will kill an innocent bystander. In studies using
this case, the vast majority of subjects choose the utilitarian option, judging it permissible
to cause the death of one to save five (e.g., Cushman et al., 2006 ; Mikhail,
2007). In the “footbridge” variant (Thomson, 1976 ), the trolley is hurtling toward
the group of five people, but the switch to divert it is inoperable. The only way to
save the five is to push a man who is wearing a heavy backpack off a bridge onto the
track, thereby slowing the trolley enough so the five can escape, but killing the man.
In contrast to the standard switch version, where causing the death of one person is
but a by-product of the action necessary to save five, most subjects in the footbridge
case find it morally impermissible to force the man with the backpack onto the
tracks (Cushman et al., 2006 ; DeScioli, Gilbert, & Kurzban, 2012 )—that is, when
the man is used as a means to saving the five—even though the consequences are the
same, and the decision to act was made knowingly and deliberately in both cases.
Such effects are found in less contrived situations, as well. Consider the real-life
distinction between terrorism, in which civilian casualties are used a means to a
political goal, and anticipated collateral damage, which is a by-product of war, even
when the same number of civilians are knowingly killed and the same political ends
are desired (say increased bargaining power in a subsequent negotiation).
The explanation again uses “higher-order beliefs” and is based on the key insight
in DeScioli et al. ( 2011 ) and formalized in Dalkiran et al. ( 2012 ) and Hoffman et al.
( 2015 ): When the harm is done as a by-product, the harm is not usually anticipated.
302
M. Hoffman et al.
So even when a witness knows that the perpetrator anticipated the harm, the witness
believes other witnesses will not be aware of this and will presume the harm was not
anticipated by the perpetrators. For instance, suppose we observe Israel killing civilians
as a by-product of a strategic raid on Hamas militants. Even if we knew Israel
had intelligence that confirmed the presence of civilians, we might not be sure others
were privy to this information. On the other hand, when the harm is done as a
means, the harm must be anticipated, since otherwise the perpetrator would have no
motive to commit the act. Why would Hamas fire rockets at civilian towns with no
military presence if Hamas does not anticipate a chance of civilian casualties?
Consequently, it is Nash equilibrium to punish harm done as a means but not harm
done as a by-product.
Similar arguments can be made for why we find direct physical transgressions
worse than indirect ones, a moral distinction relevant to, for instance, the United
States’ current drone policy. Cushman et al. ( 2006 ) found that subjects condemn
pushing a man off a bridge (to stop a train heading toward five others) more harshly
than flipping a switch that leads the man to fall through a trap door. Pushing the
victim with a stick is viewed as intermediate in terms of moral wrongness. Such
moral wrongness judgments are consistent with considerations of higher-order
beliefs: When a man is physically pushed, any witness knows the pushing was
intended, but when a man is pushed with a stick some might not realize this, and
even those who realize it might suspect others will not. Even more so when a button
is pressed that releases a trap door.
It is worth noting that the above argument does not depend on a specific model
of punishment, as in DeScioli and Kurzban’s ( 2009 ) Side-Taking Game. The above
model also makes the two novel predictions enumerated above, but nevertheless
captures the same basic insight. It is also worth noting the contrast between the
above argument and that of Cushman et al. ( 2006 ) and Greene et al. ( 2009 ), whose
models rest on ease of learning or ease of mentally simulating a situation. It is not
obvious to us how those models would explain that the omission–commission and
means–by-product distinctions seem to depend on priors or be unique to settings of
coordinated punishment.
Why Morality Depends on Categorical Distinctions
We explain why our moral intuitions depends so much more strongly on whether a
transgression occurred than on how much damage was caused. Our argument again
uses coordinated punishment and higher-order beliefs : When a categorical distinction
is violated, you know others know it was violated , but this is not always true for
continuous variables .
Consider the longstanding norm against the use of chemical weapons. This norm
recently made headlines when Bashar al-Assad was alleged to have used chemical
weapons to kill about a thousand Syrian civilians, outraging world leaders who had
Morality Games
303
been silent over his use of conventional weapons to kill over 100,000 Syrian
civilians. A Reuters/Ipsos poll at the time found that only 9 % of Americans favored
intervention in Syria, but 25 % supported intervention if the Syrian government
forces used chemical weapons against civilians (Wroughton, 2013 ). In the past, the
United States has abided by the norm against the use of chemical weapons even at
the expense of American lives: In WWII, Franklin D. Roosevelt chose to eschew
chemical weapons in Iwo Jima even though, as his advisors argued at the time, their
use would have saved thousands of American lives. It might even have been more
humane than the flame-throwers that were ultimately used against the Japanese
(“History of Chemical Weapons,” 2013). We say that the norm against chemical
weapons is a categorical norm because those who abide by it consider whether a
transgression was committed (did Assad use chemical weapons?), rather than focusing
entirely on how much harm was done (how many civilians did Assad kill?).
Other norms are similarly categorical. For instance, in the introduction to this chapter,
we noted that across cultures and throughout history, the norm against murder
has always been categorical: We consider whether a life was terminated, not the loss
of useful life years. Likewise, discrimination (e.g., during Jim Crow) is typically
based on categorical definitions of race (the “one drop rule”) and not, say, the darkness
of skin tone. Human rights are also categorical. A human rights violation
occurs if someone is tortured or imprisoned without trial, regardless of whether it
was done once or many times and regardless of whether the violation was helpful in,
say, gaining crucial information about a dangerous enemy or an upcoming terror
attack. We even assign rights in a categorical way to all Homo sapiens and not based
on intelligence, sentience, ability to feel pain, etc.
Why is it that we attend to such categorical distinctions instead of paying more
attention to the underlying continuous variable? We use game theory to explain this
phenomenon as follows: Suppose that two players (say, the United States and
France) are playing a Coordination Game in which they decide whether to punish
Syria, and each wants to sanction only if the other sanctions. We assume the United
States does not want to levy sanctions unless it is confident France will as well,
which corresponds to an assumption on the payoffs of the game (if we reverse this
assumption, it changes one line in the proof, but not the result).
We model the underlying measure of harm as a continuous variable (in our
example, it is the number of civilians killed). For simplicity, we assume this variable
is uniformly distributed, which means Assad is equally likely to kill any number of
people. This assumption is, again, not crucial, and we will point out the line in the
proof that it affects. Importantly, we assume that players do not directly observe the
continuous variable, but instead receive some imperfect signal (e.g., the United
States observes the body count by its surveyors).
Imagine a norm that dictates that witnesses punish if their estimate of the harm
from a transgression is above some threshold (e.g., levy sanctions against Syria if
the number of civilians killed is estimated to be greater than 100,000). As it turns
out, this is not a Nash equilibrium. To see why, consider what happens when the
United States gets a signal right at the threshold. The United States thinks there is a
304
M. Hoffman et al.
50 % chance that France’s estimates are lower than its own 5 and, thus, that there is
a 50 % chance that France’s estimates are lower than the threshold. This further
implies that the United States assesses only a 50 % chance that France levies sanctions,
so the United States is not sufficiently confident that France will sanction, to
make it in the United States’s interest to sanction.
What we have shown so far is that for a threshold of 100,000, it is in the interest
of the United States to deviate from the strategy dictated by the threshold norm
when it gets a signal at the threshold. This means that 100,000 is not a viable threshold,
and (since 100,000 was chosen arbitrarily) there is no Nash equilibrium in
which witnesses punish if their estimate of the harm from a transgression is above
some arbitrary threshold.
It should be noted that this result only requires that there are sufficiently many
possibilities, not that there is in fact a continuum. Neither does it require that the
distribution is uniform nor that the Coordination Game is not affected by the behavior
of Assad. The only crucial assumptions are that the distribution is not too skewed
and that the payoffs are not too dependent on the behavior of Assad (for details, see
Dalkiran et al., 2012 ; Hoffman, Yoeli, & Dalkiran, 2015 ).
What happens if such norms are learned or evolved and subject to selection?
Suppose there is a norm to attack whenever more than 100,000 civilians are killed.
Players will soon realize that they should not attack unless, say, 100,100 civilians
are killed. Then, players will learn not to attack when they estimate 100,200 civilians
are killed and so on , indefinitely. Thus, every threshold will eventually
“unravel,” and no one will ever attack. 6
Now let’s consider a categorical norm, for example, the use of chemical weapons.
We again model this as a random variable, though this time, the random variable
can only take on two values (0 and 1), each with some probability. Again,
players do not know with certainty whether the transgression occurred, but instead
get a noisy signal. In our example, the signal represents France or the United States’s
assessment of whether Assad used chemical weapons, and there is some likelihood
the assessors make mistakes: They might not detect chemical weapons when they
had been used or might think they have detected chemical weapons when none had
been used.
Unlike with the threshold norm, provided the likelihood of a mistaken signal is
not too high, there is a Nash equilibrium where both players punish when they
receive a signal that the transgression occurred. That is, the United States and France
each levy sanctions if their assessors detect chemical weapons. This is because
when the United States detects chemical weapons, the United States believes France
5
This is where the assumption of a uniform distribution comes in. Had we instead assumed, for
instance, that the continuous variable is normally distributed, then it would not be exactly 50–50
but would deviate slightly depending on the standard deviation and the location of the threshold.
Nevertheless, the upcoming logic will still go through for most Coordination Games, i.e. any
Coordination Game with risk dominance not too close to .5.
6
As with omission, this follows from iterative elimination of strictly dominated strategies (see
Hoffman et al., 2015 , for details).
Morality Games
305
likely detected them and will likely levy sanctions. So the United States’s best
response is to levy sanctions. Similarly, if the United States does not detect chemical
weapons, it expects France did not and will not levy sanctions, so the United
States is better off not levying them.
This result is useful for evaluating whether it is worthwhile to uphold a norm.
The Obama administration was harshly criticized for threatening to go to war after
the Assad regime used chemical weapons but not earlier, although the regime had
already killed tens of thousands of civilians. The model clarifies that Obama’s position
was not as inconsistent as his critics had charged: The norm against chemical
weapons may be worth enforcing since it is sustainable, whereas norms against
civilian casualties are harder to sustain and hence might not be worthwhile to
enforce.
Let’s return to some more of our motivating examples. Our model can explain
why we define murder categorically: It is not possible to punish differently for different
amount of quality life years taken, but it is possible to punish differentially for
a life taken. As with omission–commission, however, we do expect sadness or grief
to depend greatly on life years lost, even if the punishment or moralistic outrage will
be less sensitive. This is a prediction of the model that, as far as we know, has yet to
be tested.
Similarly, the “one-drop” rule is a categorical norm, so it can be socially enforced
in an apartheid society. In contrast, consider a rule that advocates giving up one’s
seat for someone with lighter skin. Since this is based on a threshold in a continuous
variable, while it might be enforceable by a unilateral authority, it cannot be enforced
by “mob rule.” Other forms of discrimination, such as discriminating against the
less attractive, or the less tall, or the elderly, all being continuous variables, cannot
be socially enforced via coordinated punishment, and hence, we expect such discrimination
to be of a different form. In particular, it will not be based not on punishing
violators. For example, male CEOs might still prefer young attractive female
secretaries, and taller men are more likely to be hired as CEOs, not because of
coordinated rewards or punishment but because those who hire the CEOs or secretaries
are likely to be satisfying their own preferences or doing what they expect will
lead to higher profits.
Likewise, the number of victims tortured by a regime or the number of lives
saved by torturing is continuous. Thus, a regime cannot be punished by a coordinated
attack by other countries or by a coordinated rebellion by its citizens based on
the number of people tortured or the paucity of reasons for such torture. But, a
regime can be attacked or overthrown depending on whether a physical harm was
inflicted on a citizen by the state. Hence, human rights are treated as inalienable,
even in the absence of an a priori justification for this nonutilitarian norm. And why
are human rights ascribed to all living Homo sapiens ? Perhaps not because of a
good logical a priori argument, but simply because violations of human rights are
enforceable by coordinated punishment, but no regime can be punished for harming
any “person” of less than a certain degree of consciousness.
Finally, here is one last application. The model might also explain why revolutions
are often caused by categorical events, such as a new tea tax or a single, widely
306
M. Hoffman et al.
publicized self-immolation, and not a breach of a threshold in, say, the quality of life
of citizens or the level of corruption. This explanation requires simply that we recognize
revolutions as a coordination problem (as argued in Morris & Shin, 2002 ;
Chwe, 2013 ), where each revolutionary chooses whether to revolt, and each is better
off revolting only if sufficiently many others revolt.
Quirks of Altruism and the Repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma
with Incomplete Information
The Repeated Prisoner ’s Dilemma has famously been used as an explanation for
the evolution of cooperation among non-kin (Axelrod & Hamilton, 1981 ; Dawkins,
2006 ; Pinker, 2003 ; Trivers, 1971 ). In this section , we show how the same basic
model can be used to explain many of the quirky features of our pro-social preferences
and ideologies .
Recall that in the Prisoner’s Dilemma, each of two players simultaneously
chooses whether to cooperate. Cooperation reduces a player’s own payoffs by c > 0
while increasing the other’s payoffs by b > c . The only Nash equilibrium is for neither
player to cooperate. In the Repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma, the players play a
string of Prisoner’s Dilemmas. That is, after the players play a Prisoner’s Dilemma,
they learn what their opponent did and play another Prisoner’s Dilemma against the
same opponent with probability δ (and the game ends with probability 1 − δ ). As is
well known in the evolutionary literature, there are equilibria in which players end
up cooperating, provided δ > c /b . In all such equilibria, cooperation is sustained
because any defection by one player causes the other player to defect. This is called
reciprocity. As the reader is surely familiar, there is ample evidence for the Repeated
Prisoner’s Dilemma as a basis for cooperation from computer simulations (e.g.,
Axelrod, 1984 ) and animal behavior (e.g., Wilkinson, 1984 ). The model can be
extended to explain contributions to public goods if, after deciding whether to contribute
to a public good, players play a Repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma (see, e.g.,
Panchanathan & Boyd, 2004 ) (Fig. 5 ).
The key to understanding these quirks is that players often have incomplete
information. For example:
1. Players do not always observe contributions. It is intuitive that, for cooperation
to occur in equilibrium, contributions need to be observed with sufficiently high
probability.
2. Others cannot always tell whether a player had an opportunity to contribute. For
defection to be penalized, it must be the case that others can tell that a player had
the opportunity to cooperate and did not (i.e. the player should not be able to hide
the fact that there was an opportunity to cooperate).
3. Sometimes, there are two ways to cooperate, and one has a higher benefit, b .
Then, the only way this more effective type of cooperation can be sustained in
equilibrium is if others know which cooperative act is more effective.
Morality Games
307
Fig. 5 The Repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma. Two players play a Prisoner’s Dilemma. They each
observe the other’s action, then, with probability δ , play another Prisoner’s Dilemma against the
same opponent, etc.
Technically, for the second and third point, what is needed is common knowledge
that a player had an opportunity to cooperate or of the more effective means of
cooperation. If observers were to know one purposely chose to defect or chose the
less cooperative act, but they do not know that others know this, then observers
think others will think punishment is not warranted, and observers will not punish.
The argument is analogous to the discussion of higher-order beliefs in the omission–commission
subsection and formalized in Dalkiran et al. ( 2012 ) and Hoffman
et al. ( 2015 ).
Interpreting the Quirks of Altruism
Below we discuss some of the quirky features of altruism identified by economists
and psychologists. In each case, we will argue that these features might be puzzling,
but not when viewed through the lens of the above model:
Insensitivity to Effectiveness . We are surprisingly insensitive to the impact of our
charitable contributions. We vote because we “want to be a part of the democratic system,”
or we “want to make a difference,” despite the fact that our likelihood of swinging
an election (even in a swing state) is smaller than our likelihood of being struck by
lightning (Gelman, Silver, & Edlin, 2012 ). Why is our desire to “make a difference” or
“be a part of the system” immune to the actual difference we are making? Our charitable
contributions or volunteer efforts suffer from the same insensitivity. Why does
anyone give money or volunteer time to Habitat for Humanity? The agency flies high
earners who have never held a hammer halfway across the world to build houses that
would be substantially more cheaply built by local experts funded by the high earners.
Experimental evidence demonstrates our insensitivity: Experimental subjects are willing
to pay the same amount to save 2000, 20,000, or 200,000 birds (Desvousges et al.,
2010 ). Likewise, when donors are told their donations will be matched, tripled, or
quadrupled, they donated identical amounts (Karlan & List, 2006 ). Why do we give so
much, but do not ensure our gifts have a large impact?
The explanation follows directly from the above model: It is often the case that
observers do not know which acts are effective and which are not and, certainly, this
308
M. Hoffman et al.
usually is not commonly known. Thus, they will not reward or punish based on
effectiveness, and we ourselves will not attend to effectiveness in equilibrium. This
explanation suggests that if we want to increase efficacy of giving, we ought to
focus on making sure donors’ friends and colleagues are aware of the efficacy of
different options. In fact, this is perhaps more important than informing the donor
of efficacy, since the donor will be motivated to uncover efficacy herself.
Magnitude of the Problem . We are surprisingly unaware of and unaffected by the
magnitudes of the problems we contribute to solving. How many of those who participated
in the recent ALS Ice Bucket Challenge have even the vaguest sense of the
number of ALS victims? (Answer: about 1/100th the victims of heart disease.) How
much happier would these individuals have been if the number of ALS victims were
cut in half? Multiplied by 100? The same questions could be asked about AIDS or
cleft lips. If we were actually motivated by our desire to rid the world of such afflictions
as we often proclaim, then we would be happier if there were fewer afflicted
individuals and less happy if there were more. But we are not even aware of these
numbers, let alone affected by them. This suggests an alternative motivation than
the one we proclaim.
On the other hand, if we give in order to gain social rewards, it does not matter
whether the problem is large or small, provided others recognize it as a problem and
the social norm is to give. If our learned or evolved preferences were drastically
impacted by the magnitude of the crises, we would be sensitive to whether the problem
was solved, perhaps motivating us to ensure that others solve it, which we
would not get credit for, or perhaps motivating us to devote too much of our
resources to solving it, beyond what we would actually get rewarded for.
Observability . There is overwhelming evidence that people give more when their
gifts are observed. Much of this evidence comes from the lab, where it has been
demonstrated a myriad of ways (e.g., Andreoni & Petrie, 2004 ; Bolton, Katok, &
Ockenfels, 2005 ; List, Berrens, Bohara, & Kerkvliet, 2004 ). For instance, when
participants play a public goods game in the laboratory for money, their contributions
are higher when they are warned that one subject will have to announce to the
room of other participants how much they contributed (List et al., 2004 ). However,
evidence also comes from real-world settings, which find large effects in settings as
diverse as blood donation (Lacetera & Macis, 2010 ), blackout prevention (Yoeli,
Hoffman, Rand, & Nowak, 2013 ), and support for national parks (Alpizar, Carlsson,
& Johansson-Stenman, 2008 ). In Switzerland, voting rates fell in small communities
when voters were given the option to vote by mail (Funk, 2006 ), which makes
it harder to tell who did not vote, even though it also makes it easier to vote. In fact,
our willingness to give more when observed extends to subtle, subconscious cues of
being observed: People give twice as much in dictator games when there are markings
on the computer screen that vaguely represent eyes (Haley & Fessler, 2005 ),
and they are more likely to pay for bagels in their office when the payment box has
a picture of eyes above it (Bateson, Nettle, & Roberts, 2006 ).
These results should not surprise anyone who believes our pro-social tendencies are
influenced by reputational concerns (though the magnitudes are surprisingly large).

The effectiveness of subconscious cues of observability points to a primary role for
reputations in our learned or evolved proclivities toward pro-social behavior. The
large impact of subtle cues of observability, however, calls into question alternative
explanations not based on reputations.
Explicit Requests . When we are asked directly for donations, we give more than if
we are not asked, even though no new information is conveyed by the request. In a
study of supermarket shoppers around Christmas time, researchers found that passersby
were more likely to give to the Salvation Army if volunteers not only rang
their bell but explicitly asked for a donation (Andreoni, Rao, & Trachtman, 2011 ).
If our motive is to actually do good, or perhaps proximally to feel good by the act of
giving, we should not be impacted by an explicit request.
However, if we evolved or learned to give in order to gain rewards or avoid punishment
as described above, then we ought to be more likely to give when, if we did
not give, it would be common knowledge that we had the option to give and chose
not to. The explicit request makes the denial common knowledge.
It is worth emphasizing that our evolved intuition to respond to explicit asks may
be (mis)applied to individual settings that lack social rewards. Imagine you are
approached by a Salvation Army volunteer in front of a store in a city where you are
visiting for one day only. A literal reading of the model would suggest that you
should be no more likely to respond to an explicit request. But it is more realistic to
expect that if your pro-social preferences were learned or evolved in repeated interactions
then applied to this new setting, you would respond in a way that is not
optimal for this particular setting and nonetheless give more when explicitly asked
(just as our preferences for sweet and fatty foods, which evolved in an environment
where food was scarce, lead us to overeat now that food is abundant).
Avoiding Situations in Which We Are Expected to Give . In the same supermarket
study, researchers discovered that shoppers were going out of their way to exit the
store through a side door, to avoid being asked for a contribution by the Salvation
Army volunteers. In another field experiment, those who were warned in advance
that a solicitor would come to the door asking for charitable donations were more
likely to not be home. The researchers estimated that among those who gave, 50 %
would have avoided being home if warned in advance of the solicitor’s time of
arrival (DellaVigna et al., 2012 ). In a laboratory analog, subjects who would have
otherwise given money in a $10 dictator game were willing to pay a dollar to keep
the remaining nine dollars and prevent the recipient from knowing that a dictator
game could have been played (Dana et al. 2006 ). If our motive were to have an
impact, we would not pay to avoid putting ourselves in a situation where we could
have such an impact. Likewise, if our motive were to feel good by giving, we would
not pay to avoid this feeling.
In contrast, if we evolved or learned to give in order to gain rewards or avoid
punishment, then we would pay to avoid situations where we are expected to give.
Again, this would be true even if, in this particular setting, we were unlikely to actually
be punished.

Norms . People are typically conditionally cooperative , meaning that they are willing
to cooperate more when they believe others contribute more. For example, students
asked to donate to a university charity gave 2.3 percentage points more when
told that others had given at a rate of 64 % than when they were told giving rates
were 46 % (Frey & Meier, 2004 ). Hotel patrons were 26 % more likely to reuse their
towels when informed most others had done the same (Goldstein, Cialdini, &
Griskevicius, 2008 ). Households have been shown to meaningfully reduce electricity
consumption when told neighbors are consuming less, both in the United States
(Ayres, Raseman, & Shih, 2012 ) and in India (Sudarshan, 2014 ).
Such conditional cooperation is easily explained by the game theory model:
When others give, one can infer that one is expected to give and may be socially
sanctioned if one does not.
Strategic Ignorance . Those at high risk of contracting a sexually transmitted disease
(STD) often go untested, presumably because if they knew they had the STD,
they would feel morally obliged to refrain from otherwise desirable activity that
risks spreading the STD. Why is it more reproachable to knowingly put a sexual
partner at risk when one knows one has the STD than to knowingly put a sexual
partner at risk by not getting tested? There is evidence that we sometimes pursue
strategic ignorance and avoid information about the negative consequences of our
decisions to others. When subjects are shown two options, one that is better for
themselves but worse for their partners and one that is worse for themselves but better
for their partners, many choose the option that is better for their partners. But,
when subjects must first press a button (at no cost) to reveal which option is better
for their partners, they choose to remain ignorant and simply select the option that
is best for themselves (Dana, Weber, & Kuang, 2007 ).
This quirk of our moral system is again easy to explain with the above model.
Typically, information about how one’s actions affect others is hard to obtain, so
people cannot be blamed for not having such information. When one can get such
information easily, others may not know that it is easy to obtain and will not punish
anyone who does not have the information. For example, although it is trivially easy
to look up charities’ financial ratings on websites like charitynavigator.org, few
people know this and could negatively judge those that donate without first checking
such websites. And even when others know that one can get this information
easily, they might suspect that others do not know this, and so avoid punishing,
since others won’t expect punishment. To summarize, strategic ignorance prevents
common knowledge of a violation and so is likely to go unpunished. We again
emphasize that we will be lenient of strategic ignorance, even when punishment is
not literally an option.
Norm of Reciprocity . We feel compelled to reciprocate favors, even if we know
that the favors were done merely to elicit reciprocation and even if the favor asked
in return is larger than the initial one granted (Cialdini 2001). For instance, members
of Hare Krishna successfully collect donations by handing out flowers to disembarking
passengers at airports, even though passengers want nothing to do with
the flowers: They walk just a few feet before discarding them in the nearest bin.
Morality Games
311
Psychologists and economists sometimes take this “norm” as given, without asking
where it comes from, and a naive reading of Trivers would lead one to think that we
should be sensitive to the magnitude of the initial favor and whether it is
manipulative.
However, according to the above model, reciprocity is the Nash equilibrium,
even if the favors are not evenly matched or manipulative, since, in equilibrium, we
are neither sensitive to such quantitative distinctions nor to whether the initial reciprocity
was manipulative, unless these facts are commonly known.
Self-Image Concerns . People sometimes play mental tricks in order to appear to
themselves as pro-social. For example, in an experiment, subjects will voluntarily take
on a boring task to save another subject from doing it, but if given the option of privately
flipping a coin to determine who gets the task, they often flip—and flip, and flip
again—until the “coin” assigns the task to the other subject (Batson, Kobrynowicz,
Dinnerstein, Kampf, & Wilson, 1997 ). Why would we be able to fool ourselves and
not, say, recognize that we are gaming the coin flip? Why do we care what we think
of ourselves at all? Are there any constraints on how we will deceive ourselves?
Such self-image considerations can be explained by noting that our self-image can
act as a simple proxy, albeit an imperfect one, for what others think of us, and also that
we are more convincing to others when we believe something ourselves (Kurzban,
2012 ; Trivers, 2011 ). This explanation suggests that the ways we deceive ourselves
correspond to quirks described throughout this section—for example, we will absolve
ourselves of remaining strategically ignorant even when it is easy not to, or be convinced
that we have done good by voting, even if we cannot swing an election.
Framing Effects . Whether we contribute is highly dependent on the details of the
experiment, such as the choice set (List, 2007 ) and the labels for the different
choices (Ross & Ward, 1996 ; Roth, 1995 ). Such findings are often taken as evidence
that social preferences cannot be properly measured in the lab (Levitt & List, 2007 ).
We believe a more fruitful interpretation is simply that the frame influences
whether the laboratory experiment “turns on” our pro-social preferences, perhaps
by simulating a situation where cooperation is expected (Levitt & List, 2007 ).
One-Shot Anonymous Giving : We give in anonymous, one-shot settings, such as
dictator games. We also sacrifice for others in the real world when there is no chance
of reciprocation: Heroes jump on grenades to save their fellow soldiers or block the
door to a classroom with their bodies to prevent a school shooter from entering
(Rand & Epstein, 2014 ). This is often seen as evidence for a role of group selection
(Fehr & Fischbacher, 2003 ).
However, an alternate explanation is that we do not consider the likelihood of
reciprocation (Hoffman et al., 2015 ), as described above. To explain the laboratory
evidence, there are two more possibilities. First, subjects may believe there is some
chance their identity will be revealed and feel the costs of being revealed as selfish
are greater than the gains from the experiment (Delton, Krasnow, Cosmides, &
Tooby, 2011 ). Second, we again emphasize that learned or evolved preferences and
ideologies are expected to be applied even in novel settings to which they are not
optimized.

M. Hoffman et al.
Conclusion
In this chapter we have showed that a single approach–game theory , with the help
of evolution and learning –can explain many of our moral intuitions and ideologies.
We now discuss two implications .
Group Selection . Our chapter relates to the debate on group selection, whereby
group level competition and reproduction is supposed to occasionally cause individuals
to evolve to sacrifice their own payoffs to benefit the group (e.g., Wilson,
2006 ). One of the primary pieces of evidence cited in support of group selection is
the existence of human cooperation and morality (Fehr & Fischbacher, 2003 ; Fehr,
Fischbacher, & Gächter, 2002 ; Gintis, Bowles, Boyd, & Fehr, 2003 ; Haidt, 2012 ;
Wilson, 2010 , 2012 ), in particular: giving in one-shot anonymous laboratory experiments,
intuitively sacrificing one’s life for the group (jumping on the grenade), and
contributions to public goods or charity. However, we have reviewed an alternative
explanation for these phenomena that does not rest on group selection. It also yields
predictions about these phenomena that group selection does not, such as that people
are more likely to cooperate when they are being observed and there is variance
in the cost of cooperation. The approach described here also explains other phenomena,
such as categorical norms and ineffective altruism. These lead to social welfare
losses, which is suboptimal from the group’s perspective. The categorical norm
against murder, for example, leads to enormous waste when keeping alive, sometimes
for years, those who have virtually no chance of a future productive life.
Admittedly, despite their inefficiencies, these moral intuitions do not rule out
group selection, since group selection can be weak relative to individual selection.
But it does provide a powerful argument that group selection is unnecessary for
explaining many interesting aspects of human morality. It also suggests that group
selection is, indeed, at most, weak. One example that makes this especially clear is
discrete norms. Recall that we argued that continuous norms are not sustainable
because individuals benefit by deviating around the threshold. Notice that this benefit
is small, since the likelihood that signals are right around the threshold is low.
Group selection could easily overwhelm the benefit one would get from deviating
from this Nash equilibrium, suggesting group selection is weak (i.e. there are few
group- level reproductive events, high migration rates, high rates of “mutation” in
the form of experimentation among individuals, etc.).
Logical Justification of Moral Intuitions . In each of the applications above, we
explained moral intuitions without referring to existing a priori logical justifications
by philosophers or others. Our explanation for our sense of rights does not rely on
Locke’s “state of nature.” No argument we gave rests on God as an orderly designer,
on Platonic ideals, on Kant’s concepts of autonomy and humanity, etc. What does
this mean for these a priori justifications? It suggests that they are not the source of
our morality and are, instead, post hoc justifications of our intuitions (Haidt, 2012 ).
To see what we mean, consider the following analogy. One might wonder why
we find paintings and sculptures of voluptuous women beautiful. Before the
Morality Games
313
development of sexual selection theory, one might have argued that perfect spheres
are some kind of Platonic solid, and inherently desirable, or that curvy hips yield
golden ratios. But with our current understanding of sexual selection, we recognize
that our sense of beauty has evolved and that there is no platonic sense of beauty
outside of that shaped by sexual selection. Any argument about perfect spheres is
unparsimonious and likely flawed. Without the help of evolution and game theory,
did philosophers conjure the moral equivalents of perfect spheres and golden ratios?
The state of nature, the orderly designer, Platonic ideals, autonomy, and humanity,
etc.—perhaps these arguments are also unfounded and unnecessary.

whether we actually would, or should, target Saddam. I asked Misha, and then
Yitzhak, only whether such an operation might seriously be considered by the
government. If not, I said, we’d drop it. Both replied that we should go ahead

with the planning and preparation. The November 1992 exercise was intended
as a final test of its viability — before deciding whether actually to do it.

A few weeks earlier, Rabin and I had talked through the arguments for and
against. The arguments against it were obvious. Yes, in the past we had
abducted, or even killed, leaders of groups involved in terror attacks. But we’d
never contemplated targeting a head of state. Crossing that line risked being
seen not just as attacking a dictator with a record of ruthlessness and murder at
home, and aggression towards Israel, but long-accepted norms of international
relations. The arguments in favour began with the fact that Saddam was a
meglomaniacally ambitious dictator. He had also fired missiles on our towns
and cities. He retained the capability to arm them with chemical warheads,
possibly biological agents, and conceivably a nuclear warhead in the future.
Both Rabin and I agreed there were two key tests of whether an attack would be
justified: was it was the only realistic way of confronting the threat from Iraq,
and would killing him end, or at least exponentially reduce, that threat.

Though there was no final decision at our meeting, Rabin was clearly
inclined to go ahead. An Israeli TV program two decades later unearthed a
summary of the discussion, written by his military aide. “The Prime Minister
approves the target... This is an operation we should go for when the probability
of success is very high,” it said. “Thus, we have to build the operational
capability in the best possible way, and continue preparations.” In another part
of the record, Rabin is quoted as having defined the elimination of Saddam as a
“meaningful objective” with implications for “the very security of Israel.” He
added: “I do not see anyone similar to him in the Arab world.”

I, too, was on balance persuaded we should do it. In the years since, I’ve
sometime reflected on what happened with Saddam still in place: the 2003
invasion of Iraq, led by the younger President Bush, the tens of thousands of
lives lost, the trillions of dollars spent on a war without any clear end, and the
near-disintegration of Iraq. But with the complexities of Iraq then and now,
there can be no simple answer to how the situation would have changed if we’d
killed Saddam. Our view, based on detailed intelligence analyses, was that the
likely result would have been a fairly rapid takeover by a few top security and
Baath Party figures and that, while the new Iraqi leadership might try to retaliate

Her reputation for truthfulness does not go to any bad
acts she may have committed 20 years ago. And your Honor, even

criminal convictions are generally not admissible 10 years

after the fact. So presentation of this type of evidence is

simply nothing more than a smear campaign, which is prescribed

by multiple Federal Rules of Evidence.

And finally, any marginal probative value of these bad

acts as a child is vastly outweighed by the undue prejudice it
would cause Ms. Giuffre before a jury.

Your Honor, now I'm turning to point number 12. We've

asked the Court to exclud vidence relating to the tax

compliance of Ms. Giuffre's not-for-profit Victims Refuse

Silence. Rule 401 is the first rule under which this should be

excluded. The alleged tax compliance of her not-for-profit

does not go to whether or not defendant defamed Ms. Giuffre and

does not go to whether or not defendant abused Ms. Giuffre.

It should also b xcluded under 403. It is highly

prejudicial. It would give the wrong impression to the jury
that Ms. Giuffre's organization is not tax compliant, which, in
fact, it is a fact that defendant does not acknowledge in her
briefing.

Proving whether or not Ms. Giuffre's not-for-profit is

tax compliant would also be a mini trial and, frankly, a

sideshow to this case.

—INGVAR KAMPRAD, founder of IKEA, world’s largest furniture brand

Ten of thousands of people, most of them less capable than you, leave their jobs every day. It’s

neither uncommon nor fatal. Here are a few exercises to help you realize just how natural job changes
are and how simple the transition can be.

1. ‘First, a familiar reality check: Are you more likely to find what you want in your current job or
somewhere else?

If you were fired from your job today, what would you do to get things under financial control?

3. Take a sick day and post your resume on the major job sites. Even if you have no immediate plans
to leave your job, post your resume on sites such as www.monster.com and www.career-
builder.com, using a pseudonym if you prefer. This will show you that there are options besides
your current place of work. Call headhunters if your level makes such a step appropriate, and send
a brief e-mail such as the one below to friends and non-work contacts.

Dear All,

I am considering making a career move and am interested in all opportunities that might come to
mind. Nothing is too outrageous or out of left field. [If you know what you want or don’t want on
some level, feel free to add, “I am particularly interested in ...” or “I would like to avoid ...”’]

Please let me know if anything comes to mind!

Tim

Call in sick or take a vacation day to complete all of these exercises during a normal 9-5 workday.
This will simulate unemployment and lessen the fear factor of non-office limbo.

In the world of action and negotiation, there is one principle that governs all others: The person
who has more options has more power. Don’t wait until you need options to search for them. Take
a sneak peek at the future now and it will make both action and being assertive easier.

4. If you run or own a company, imagine that you have just been sued and must declare bankruptcy.
The company is now insolvent and you must close up shop. This is something you must legally do,
and there are no finances to entertain other options. How would you survive?

enemies of the people, being crowned during the current
revolutionary period with infamy and dishonour. This applies to the
former regime in Iraq, the regime in Syria and the Mubarak regime in
Egypt.

The case of Hizbullah reflects this revolutionary predicament with
respect to the Palestinian cause and the struggle against Israel. It
suffices to recall which side this group came down upon when it had
to chose between the Syrian people, who are presently fighting for
their future and for the future of their children, and a regime that has
thrived off a conflict in which it has never fired a single shot to
liberate the Golan Heights from Israeli occupation, regardless of its
political posturing.

All this leads to the question of whether Netanyahu's new position is
based on some type of analysis of the ongoing Arab revolutions.
Does he believe that they will turn out to be like their predecessors
and feed off the Palestinian cause, for example, and has this led him
to want to deal firmly with them from the outset? Egypt received a
message to the effect that Al-Qaeda was in control of the Sinai and
that Israel therefore felt itself free to act as it wishes.

Alternatively, could Netanyahu's thinking be headed in another
direction, such that the current Arab revolutions are seeking to rectify
the fatal habit of previous revolutions of focussing on external affairs
at the expense of domestic needs and that they will therefore seek to
avert wars, conflicts and attendant tribulations?

Surely it is no coincidence that a leading Nasserist Arab nationalist
and presidential candidate, Hamdeen Sabahi, has stated several times
that he has no intention of opening hostilities against Israel and every
intention instead of waging war on poverty and fighting for
educational and healthcare reforms and other such urgent domestic
causes.

"
IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028080.txt,"By mid-December 1990, war was virtually certain. Misha and I had been to
Washington in September and agreed with the Americans that, unless we were
attacked by Saddam, we would stay out of it. To do otherwise was clearly not
just against the US-led coalition’s interests. Given the importance of our
alliance with Washington, it was against our inrerests as well. Yet with
hostilities obviously getting closer, Misha phoned Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney a few days later to remind him of the guid pro quo: we would be kept
fully in the loop about the details and timing of the initial American air strikes.
At around five o’clock on the afternoon on January 16, 1991, Misha got a call
from Cheney. He said “h-hour” would be at seven that evening Washington
time. Three a.m. in Israel.

Though we hoped to stay out, I’d now spent months coordinating and
overseeing preparations to ensure we could attack Saddam’s Scuds if necessary.
By far most of the missiles were mounted on mobile launching vehicles, and
Saddam was almost certainly going to be firing them from the vastness of Iraq’s
western desert. That meant an Israeli air strike alone wouldn’t work. We
decided on a joint air and ground operation, built around a newly created air-
mobile division and other special units. A force of 500 to 600 soldiers would
take control of key areas and road junctions in western Iraq and start hunting
and destroying, or at least impeding, the Scud launchers.

We also engaged in secret diplomacy in the hopes of reducing one of the
obvious risks in such an attack: a conflict with Jordan, which we’d have to
overfly to reach Iraq. The Mossad had a unit called 7evel, a kind of shadow
foreign ministry for states with which we had no formal relations but with
which, in both side’s interests, we had a channel of backdoor communications.
It was headed by Ephraim Halevy, a London-born Israeli who had come to
Palestine in 1948 as a teenager. He had built up a personal relationship with
King Hussein, and now arranged for us to meet him at a country residence
which the king had in Britain.

A few weeks before the war, I boarded a private jet to London along with
Halevy and Prime Minister Shamir. Shamir had never met the king before and
nor, of course, had I. But we didn’t talk about the forthcoming meeting on the
five-hour flight. Instead, Shamir opened up in a way I’d never seen: about his
childhood as part of a relatively well-off family in Poland; his love of literature,
and of the Bible. In a way, it reminded me of how my father had spoken to me
when I was growing up — minus the “well-off family” part.

I” pleased to present the fourth annual report from the Office of

Government Information Services (OGIS) detailing our fiscal year (FY)

2013 activities. We are extremely proud of all that OGIS has accomplished
in our four years of operation. We have put Congress’s novel idea—

applying Alternative Dispute Resolution techniques to an often highly
adversarial process—into action. We have assisted thousands of Freedom

of Information Act (FOIA) requesters from across the country and around >
the globe, along with dozens of agencies, in resolving disputes, some of

which would have otherwise led to costly litigation. We have worked with

agencies to better fulfill their responsibility to provide good customer

service, resolve disputes with FOIA requesters, and promote compliance

with FOIA.

Demand for OGIS’s services is high. Requests for assistance in resolving
FOIA disputes greeted me the morning the office opened four years ago. In
FY 2013, the number of incoming cases jumped 40 percent from the previous
year to more than 500 cases; at the same time, we closed nearly 500 cases—
also a 40-percent increase from the previous year—and handled hundreds of
inquiries by telephone and email.

Much work remains for our innovative program. While we have carried out
Congress’s mandate to review Federal agency FOIA policies, procedures, and
compliance in several ways, we would like to implement a more robust review

program. OGIS’s mission is broad, and like many government programs, we

could, and because he never dreamed he would get caught, they say. Mr. Epstein’s
defenders counter that he has been unjustly persecuted because of his wealth and lofty
connections.

Sitting on his patio on “Little St. Jeff’s” in the Virgin Islands several months ago, as his
legal troubles deepened, Mr. Epstein gazed at the azure sea and the lush hills of St.
Thomas in the distance, poked at a lunch of crab and rare steak prepared by his personal
chef, and tried explain how his life had taken such a turn. He likened himself to Gulliver
shipwrecked among the diminutive denizens of Lilliput.

“Gulliver’s playfulness had unintended consequences,” Mr. Epstein said. ““That is what
happens with wealth. There are unexpected burdens as well as benefits.”

Those benefits are on full display on his island where, despite his time in jail, Mr. Epstein
has commissioned a new estate. The villa will occupy the island’s promontory, which
offers views of the Atlantic on one side and the Caribbean on the other. It will have a
separate library to house Mr. Epstein’s 90,000 volumes, a Japanese bathhouse and what
he calls a “Ziegfeld” movie theater.

For now, however, those visions of a private paradise have been replaced by the cold
reality of a jail cell.

The legal drama began in 2005, when a young woman who gave Mr. Epstein massages at
his Palm Beach mansion told the local police about the encounter. She was 14 at the time,
and was paid $200.

The police submitted the results of their investigation to the state attorney, asking that
Mr. Epstein be charged with sexual relations with minors. His lawyers say Mr. Epstein
never knew the young women were under age, and point to depositions in which the
masseuses — several of whom have filed civil suits — admitted to lying about their age.

In July 2005, a Florida grand jury charged Mr. Epstein with a lesser offense, soliciting
prostitution. Mr. Epstein’s legal team, which would eventually include the former
prosecutor Kenneth W. Starr and the Harvard law professor Alan M. Dershowitz, was
elated: Mr. Epstein would avoid prison.

But then the United States attorney’s office in Miami became involved. Last summer, Mr.
Epstein got an ultimatum: plead guilty to a charge that would require him to register as a
sex offender, or the government would charge him with sexual tourism, according to
people who were briefed on the discussions.

David Weinstein, an attorney in the government’s Miami office, declined to discuss the
specifics of the case. But he did address the subject of Mr. Epstein’s means and
prominent legal team, and dismissed a proposal by Mr. Epstein’s lawyers — who
opposed the application of federal statutes in the case — that he be confined to his house
in Palm Beach for a probationary period.

nominal growth of the economy (see Exhibit 4). Second, the recent backup in interest rates was
driven primarily by improving real growth expectations, not higher inflation. This distinction is critical,
because higher rates in response to improving real growth tend to benefit earnings sufficiently to
overcome the downward pressure they place on valuation multiples. Finally, it will take a number of
years before higher rates meaningfully impact aggregate S&P 500 interest expense, considering 91%
of S&P 500 debt is fixed-rate and only 13% matures over the next two years.

Low Probability of Recession

We continue to maintain a low, 10%, probability of recession driven by:
e The positive trend of leading economic indicators
e Low levels of inflation

e The continued slow but steady pace of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. We believe that
Federal Reserve Chairman Powell’s recent commentary indicates that the FOMC will continue
to be driven by data and financial market conditions. Their stated goal is to extend this
expansion “indefinitely.”' While the Federal Reserve dots point towards four more interest rate
hikes by the end of 2019, we do not think that such hikes materially increase the odds of a
recession in an economy that continues to grow at levels that are generally regarded as above
trend growth in the US.

Are Qadhafi and other deposed leaders deluded in thinking all is
well in their kingdom or their country?

Deluded isn't quite the word, because if you're surrounded by a group
of sycophants who tell you what you want to hear, not what you need
to hear, you can be in touch with reality by psychological tests but
quite out of touch with reality politically. With Saddam Hussein, this
was particularly true—where to provide criticism of him was either to
lose your job or lose your life. Everyone was constantly praising him
and his brilliance, and he was spared wise council.

In addition to these circles of sycophants, is narcissism a common
trait among autocrats?

That is a wonderful question. I'm just putting the finishing touches on
my capstone book, which will be called Dreams of Glory: Narcissism
and Politics. | see narcissism as being a very powerful explanatory
factor for many of these leaders, who display a number of traits of
narcissism. One is they have a really exalted self-concept on the
surface, and are very sensitive to slight or any information to the
contrary. So they can get very angry if someone questions them.
Secondly, when there is something that shatters that image—and this
will be interesting to see what happens with Qadhafi—there can be
what's called a narcissistic rage. So, for example, with Saddam
Hussein as he was exiting Kuwait, lighting the oil wells on fire—that
was probably an example of that. Their interpersonal relationships
are very disturbed, and they surround themselves with people who
make them feel good. So that it is really a great hazard to in any way
criticize the leader. Qadhafi did a great deal to hollow out the

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016902.txt,"When it comes to real robots helping real people, the standard definition of AI
fails us, for two fundamental reasons: First, optimizing the robot’s reward function in
isolation is different from optimizing it when the robot acts around people, because
people take actions too. We make decisions in service of our own interests, and these
decisions dictate what actions we execute. Moreover, we reason about the robot—that is,
we respond to what we think it’s doing or will do and what we think its capabilities are.
Whatever actions the robot decides on need to mesh well with ours. This is the
coordination problem.

Second, it is ultimately a human who determines what the robot’s reward function
should be in the first place. And they are meant to incentivize robot behavior that
matches what the end-user wants, what the designer wants, or what society as a whole
wants. I believe that capable robots that go beyond very narrowly defined tasks will need
to understand this to achieve compatibility with humans. This is the va/ue-alignment
problem.

The Coordination Problem: People are more than objects in the environment.

When we design robots for a particular task, it’s tempting to abstract people away. A
robotic personal assistant, for example, needs to know how to move to pick up objects, so
we define that problem in isolation from the people for whom the robot is picking these
objects up. Still, as the robot moves around, we don’t want it bumping into anything, and
that includes people, so we might include the physical location of the person in the
definition of the robot’s state. Same for cars: We don’t want them colliding with other
cars, so we enable them to track the positions of those other cars and assume that they’ ll
be moving consistently in the same direction in the future. A human being, in this sense,
is no different to a robot from a ball rolling on a flat surface. The ball will behave in the
next few seconds the same way it behaved in the past few; it keeps rolling in the same
direction at roughly the same speed. This is of course nothing like real human behavior,
but such simplification enables many robots to succeed in their tasks and, for the most
part, stay out of people’s way. A robot in your house, for example, might see you
coming down the hall, move aside to let you pass, and resume its task once you’ve gone
by.

As robots have become more capable, though, treating people as consistently
moving obstacles is starting to fall short. A human driver switching lanes won’t continue
in the same direction but will move straight ahead once they’ ve made the lane change.
When you reach for something, you often reach around other objects and stop when you
get to the one you want. When you walk down a hallway, you have a destination in
mind: You might take a right into the bedroom or a left into the living room. Relying on
the assumption that we’re no different from a rolling ball leads to inefficiency when the
robot stays out of the way if it doesn’t need to, and it can imperil the robot when the
person’s behavior changes. Even just to stay out of the way, robots have to be somewhat
accurate at anticipating human actions. And, unlike the rolling ball, what people will do
depends on what they decide to do. So to anticipate human actions, robots need to start
understanding human decision making. And that doesn’t mean assuming that human
behavior is perfectly optimal; that might be enough for a chess- or Go-playing robot, but
in the real world, people’s decisions are less predictable than the optimal move in a board
game.

For their part, American universities and US scholars have also engaged in China during
this period, although in far fewer—but not insignificant—numbers. (For example, in
2015-2016, 11,688 American students and scholars were studying in China.)° For those
in the field of Chinese studies, it is de rigueur to study and do research in Chinese
universities. Professional collaboration among faculty—mainly in the sciences and
medicine—has also flourished. Some US universities—notably Johns Hopkins School
of Advanced International Studies (Hopkins-Nanjing Center), New York University
(NYU-Shanghai), and Duke University (Duke-Kunshan)—have gone so far as to
establish campuses in China, while others have opened centers (e.g., Stanford, Virginia,
Chicago, Yale, Harvard, Columbia). Many more American universities have forged
collaborative exchange programs with Chinese counterparts.

While US-China exchanges in higher education have primarily been a success

story, as in many other dimensions of the Sino-American relationship, clouds have
appeared on the horizon.’ American students have become less keen than in the past
to study in China due to concerns about pollution, lack of open internet access, and
expanding political controls. American scholars trying to conduct research in China
have run into an increasing number of restrictions and impediments since 2010, due
to a broad campaign against “foreign hostile forces” and an increasingly draconian
political atmosphere that has cast a shadow across Chinese society, especially over
higher education. Whole subject areas and regions of the country are now off-limits
to American and other foreign scholars for fieldwork; previously normal interactions
with Chinese scholars are now often heavily circumscribed; many Chinese scholars
have become reluctant to meet with American counterparts; a growing number of
libraries are off-limits; central-level archives have been closed, and provincial; municipal
archives are increasingly restricted; interviews with government officials (at all levels)
are more difficult to arrange; public opinion surveys must be carried out with Chinese
partners, if they can be conducted at all; simple eyewitness social research in rural and,
even some urban areas, is considerably more limited than previously. In short, normal
scholarly research practices permitted elsewhere in the world are regularly proscribed
in China. These restrictions also include the inability to hold open and uncensored
public scholarly discussions, conferences, and other kinds of events. Meanwhile,
Chinese students and scholars enjoy unimpeded access to all of these activities in the
United States, resulting in a severe asymmetry in Sino-American scholarly exchange.
This contravenes the spirit of the bilateral US-China educational exchange accords.

At the same time, storm clouds are also gathering on American campuses with respect
to another aspect of this important relationship, namely, growing concerns about
unfair Chinese “influence-seeking activities” in the United States.

into total capital growth or into exhaust. Thus it is the contribution to those two
desiderata explained from outside, rather than by the individual’s behavior. Net gift
deducts that negative component (gift received) from the positive one to leave the
part which the individual’s behavior explains. Thus individual output, as the sum of
growth and net gift, is the sum of desiderata realized by behavior. That makes it the
unique behavioral maximand as a flow. Division by the individual’s total capital,
which is her whole means of behavior, gives total capital rate of return as the rate

maximand.

This can be summarized in a slightly different way. Cash flow measures the means of
taste satisfaction now. Total capital growth measures gain in means of expected
satisfactions, discounted according to our taste for impatience (time preference)
tempered by our taste for risk aversion. Output is their sum. Behavior reveals and
maximizes the taste satisfaction including provision for future satisfaction.
Therefore risk-adjusted output is the flow maximand. Capital of both factors, at
present value, is defined as the whole means of that satisfaction, and implicitly of
behavior. Therefore risk-adjusted return, the ratio of the flow maximand to its

means, is the rate maximand.

What Turgot said in 1766, in his Reflections, was

“...as soon as the profits of one employment of money... increase or
diminish, capitals turn in that direction... or withdraw and turn to other
employments... Whatever the manner in which money is employed, its
product cannot increase or diminish without all the other employments

experiencing a proportionate increase or diminution.”

Turgot did not allow for risk in this quick summary, but otherwise explained the

mechanics that tend to equalize return.

In August 2007, in a clear attempt to coerce a state settlement, Ms. Villafana threatened
to broaden the investigation to include a money laundering violation (18 U.S.C. § 1956),
though all the funds expended were simply Mr. Epstein’s, and a violation for operating an
unlicensed money-transmitting business (18 U.S.C. § 1960), though Mr. Epstein never
had such a business. See Tab 22, August 31, 2007 Letter from M. Villafana to Ross
(reciting, in a target letter to one of Epstein’s employees, that the investigation concerns
“suspected violations of federal law, including but not limited to, possible violations of
Title 18, United States Code, Sections ... 1591, ... 1956, 1960... .’) (emphasis
added).

On the very same day that the grand jury issued subpoenas to the records-custodian and
employees of Epstein’s businesses for all financial transactions from 2003 forward, Ms.
Villafana (who we were told was not authorized to act in this regard without supervisory
approval) promised to close the money-laundering investigation “if the sex offense case
is resolved.” See Tab 23, August 16, 2007 Letter from M. Villafana to G. Lefcourt (“In
other words, if the sex offense case is resolved, the Office would close its investigation
into other areas as well. The matter has not been, and it does not appear that it will be,
resolved so the money laundering investigation continues, and Request Number 6
[seeking records of every financial transaction conducted by Epstein and his six
businesses from “January 1, 2003 to the present”] will not be withdrawn.”).

Two weeks later, when Mr. Epstein continued to oppose federal prosecution during
negotiations and Mr. Epstein’s counsel sought a meeting with the United States Attorney,
AUSA Villafana then classified all of Mr. Epstein’s assistants as targets (sending a target
letter to one of them and promising the attorney of the other two that additional target
letters would be served on them as well), dispatched FBI agents to the homes of two of
his secretaries, and personally telephoned Mr. Epstein’s largest business client to advise
him of the nature of the investigation. See Tab 22, August 31, 2007 Letter from M.

FAUSA Sloman Forces Mr. Epstein’s Lawyers to Convince the State Prosecutors To

Impose a More Severe Sentence Than They Believe Is Appropriate

Throughout the plea negotiations with the USAO, Mr. Sloman and Ms. Villafana
continually insisted that the only way they would agree not to bring a federal indictment
was if Epstein’s lawyers, not the state prosecutors as required under the Petite Policy,
convinced the state prosecutors to impose a more severe punishment than the state
believed was appropriate under the circumstances.

FAUSA Sloman’s version of the history with respect to the sentence he required Mr.
Epstein’s lawyers to seek from the State contradicts his later assertion, which is patently
false—that “the SDFL indicated a willingness to defer to the State the length of
incarceration” and “considered a plea to federal charges that limited Epstein’s
sentencing exposure...” See Tab 1, May 19, 2008 Letter from J. Sloman. In fact, by a

implementation. Frequent changes in governments, plans, and
priorities have all contributed to the failure of the reform process in
Jordan over the past decade. In view of the recent uprisings in the
Arab world, the political elite must recognize that the only way they
can retain power is by sharing it, and governments will have to
acknowledge that substituting serious implementation with reform
rhetoric fools no one. Given that Jordan enjoys a rather distinctive
position-its monarchy enjoys widespread legitimacy and plays a role
in stability that is acknowledged by all sectors of society, including
the opposition-the king is in a unique position to lead a serious
reform process. The choice in Jordan seems to be similar to that of
other countries around it: either lead a reform process from above in a
gradual, orderly, and serious way, or watch it take place in the streets
below with uncontrolled consequences.

“This is not unlike any other industry that

can produce a toxic product like the opioid

industry or the tobacco industry.
There is a powerful interest involved.”

“The whole thing has to do with corralling desperate people in China, who believe

that Americans wouldn't lie to them out right,” Litowitz said.

And while the program was designed to create jobs in rural and distressed regions
known as “targeted employment areas,” communities like Palm Beach — a top
destination for wealthy retirees with a median household income of more than

$110,000 — somehow met the same criteria.

Florida's Department of Economic Opportunity approved the Palm House project for
such a designation in 2012 because Palm Beach had an unemployment rate of 18.5
percent, above “the qualifying rate of 13.4 percent for that time period,’ according to
the state agency. Other EB-5 projects, including Hudson Yards in New York, the
largest private real estate development in the country, were also able to take

advantage of similar demographics.

Without mentioning his past dealings in Connecticut or in Nantucket, Matthews
touted his wife Mia Matthews’ success as an actress, singer and star of the
Nickelodeon show “Every Witch Way” and CW’s “South Beach,” which lasted all of
one season. To further show off his connections and status in Palm Beach, he would
take EB-5 immigration agents from China to a Mar-a-Lago charity event to meet

Trump, changing the topic, said to Scarborough and Brzezinski, “So what about you
guys? What’s going on?” He was referencing their not-so-secret secret relationship.

Scarborough and Brzezinski said it was all still complicated, and not public, officially,
but it was good and everything was getting resolved.

“You guys should just get married,” prodded Trump.

“T can marry you! I’m an Internet Unitarian minister,” Kushner, otherwise an Orthodox
Jew, said suddenly.

“What?” said the president. “What are you talking about? Why would they want you to
marry them when / could marry them? When they could be married by the president! At
Mar-a-Lago!”

7 OK Ok

Almost everybody advised Jared not to take the inside job. As a family member, he would
command extraordinary influence from a position that no one could challenge. As an
insider, a staffer, not only could his experience be challenged, but while the president
himself might not yet be exposed, a family member on staff would be where enemies and
critics might quite effectively start chipping from. Besides, inside Trump’s West Wing, if
you had a title—that is, other than son-in-law—people would surely want to take it from
you.

Both Jared and Ivanka listened to this advice—from among others it came from Jared’s
brother, Josh, doubly making this case not only to protect his brother but also because of
his antipathy to Trump—but both, balancing risk against reward, ignored it. Trump
himself variously encouraged his son-in-law and his daughter in their new ambitions and,
as their excitement mounted, tried to express his skepticism—while at the same time
telling others that he was helpless to stop them.

For Jared and Ivanka, as really for everybody else in the new administration, quite
including the president, this was a random and crazy turn of history such that how could
you not seize it? It was a joint decision by the couple, and, in some sense, a joint job. Jared
and Ivanka had made an earnest deal between themselves: if sometime in the future the
time came, she’d be the one to run for president (or the first one of them to take the shot).
The first woman president, Ivanka entertained, would not be Hillary Clinton, it would be
Ivanka Trump.

Bannon, who had coined the Jarvanka conflation now in ever greater use, was horrified
when the couple’s deal was reported to him. “They didn’t say that? Stop. Oh come on.
They didn’t actually say that? Please don’t tell me that. Oh my god.”

And the truth was that at least by then Ivanka would have more experience than almost

In recent weeks, prosecutors with the Justice Department's public integrity section — which examines possible 
political and government corruption — have sought documents related to Broidy's business dealings. 
Among the information sought by investigators are details about Broidy's work on behalf of and interactions 
with the Chinese and Malaysian officials, according to two people familiar with the document requests. 
As part of their efforts, prosecutors have subpoenaed casino magnate Steve Wynn, the former RNC finance 
chairman and longtime Trump friend, for copies of records and communications related to Broidy. 
An attorney for Wynn, Reid Weingarten, declined to comment, saying only that Wynn is cooperating with the 
Justice Department. 
Steve Wynn is completely cooperating with the investigation and he certainly has no reason to believe that 
anyone acted improperly in anything he knew about or was involved in, Weingarten said in a statement.

will be acceptable to us.”) Apparently, the original dissidents promulgating the AI-risk
message were the AI pioneers themselves!

Evolution’s Fatal Mistake

There have been many arguments, some sophisticated and some less so, for why the
Control Problem is real and not some science-fiction fantasy. Allow me to offer one that
illustrates the magnitude of the problem:

For the last hundred thousand years, the world (meaning the Earth, but the
argument extends to the solar system and possibly even to the entire universe) has been in
the human-brain regime. In this regime, the brains of Homo sapiens have been the most
sophisticated future-shaping mechanisms (indeed, some have called them the most
complicated objects in the universe). Initially, we didn’t use them for much beyond
survival and tribal politics in a band of foragers, but now their effects are surpassing
those of natural evolution. The planet has gone from producing forests to producing
cities.

As predicted by Turing, once we have superhuman AI (“the machine thinking
method”), the human-brain regime will end. Look around you—you’ re witnessing the
final decades of a hundred-thousand-year regime. This thought alone should give people
some pause before they dismiss AI as just another tool. One of the world’s leading AI
researchers recently confessed to me that he would be greatly relieved to learn that
human-level AI was impossible for us to create.

Of course, it might still take us a long time to develop human-level AI. But we
have reason to suspect that this is not the case. After all, it didn’t take long, in relative
terms, for evolution—the blind and clumsy optimization process—to create human-level
intelligence once it had animals to work with. Or multicellular life, for that matter:
Getting cells to stick together seems to have been much harder for evolution to
accomplish than creating humans once there were multicellular organisms. Not to
mention that our level of intelligence was limited by such grotesque factors as the width
of the birth canal. Imagine an AI developer being stopped in his tracks because he
couldn’t manage to adjust the font size on his computer!

There’s an interesting symmetry here: In fashioning humans, evolution created a
system that is, at least in many important dimensions, a more powerful planner and
optimizer than evolution itself'is. We are the first species to understand that we’re the
product of evolution. Moreover, we’ve created many artifacts (radios, firearms,
spaceships) that evolution would have little hope of creating. Our future, therefore, will
be determined by our own decisions and no longer by biological evolution. In that sense,
evolution has fallen victim to its own Control Problem.

We can only hope that we’re smarter than evolution in that sense. We are
smarter, of course, but will that be enough? We’re about to find out.

The Present Situation

So here we are, more than half a century after the original warnings by Turing, Wiener,
and Good, and a decade after people like me started paying attention to the AI-risk
message. I’m glad to see that we’ve made a lot of progress in confronting this issue, but
we're definitely not there yet. AI risk, although no longer a taboo topic, is not yet fully

after first announcing that he had solved Fermat's Last Theorem he could
finally lay it to rest.

The Special Purpose Objection

Before I declare mankind’s outright victory over computers, the Special
Purpose Objection must be overcome. The objectors would argue that
Wiles is a Special Purpose computer. Special Purpose computers are at
no risk of breaking the Turing limit when they solve problems they have

Theorem (Undecidability of Hilbert’s tenth problem)

There is no algorithm which, for a given arbitrary Diophantine
equation, would tell whether the equation has a solution or not.

been programmed to answer. The objection misses the key point. I am
not arguing having a solution to a given mathematical puzzle presents a
difficulty to a computer; I am arguing a computer cannot discover one.

Take, for example, the search engine Google. If I type “where can
I find the proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem?” into the search box, it will
retrieve a PDF of the proof as the third result. It appears this special
purpose computer solved the problem. But you immediately see the
difficulty. Google search already knew the answer, or more precisely had
indexed the answer. The computer was not tackling a random problem
from scratch. It was tackling a problem for which it knew the answer, or
at least where an answer could be found. There is no sense in which the
search engine discovered the proof.

To really understand this objection we need to examine exactly
what Turing and Matiyasevich proved.

An arbitrary problem is one you do not already know the solution
to when you write the algorithm. You can think of it as a variable. Is
there an algorithm that can solve problem ‘X’? The alternative is a special
program. It can solve problem Y. Y is a problem it knows. It must have
the solution coded somewhere within it in a computably expandable way.
You might think of this as a table of constants; problem Y has solution
1, problem Z has solution 2, and so on. But it could be more subtle than
that. Problem Y might have a solution which is encrypted so you cannot
recognize it within the program, or it might even be the result of some

2017: Falling growth, negotiations and a consumer squeeze
We think there are clear warning signs that conditions are deteriorating, uncertainty is
set to return and a consumer squeeze is coming for the UK.
Falling growth to compound deficit problems
Real gdp is only expected to fall 0.1% in 2016 vs the March forecast. But the UK Office
of Budgetary Responsibility expects growth to slip by 0.8% next year (2.2% to 1.4%) and
0.4% on 2018 (2.1% to 1.7%) vs March. A notable slice of this is can be attributed to the
OBR’s estimate that Brexit added £59bn to UK borrowing to 2022, or nearly £200mn a
week. These numbers include Phillip Hammond’s sensible but small measures. Our UK
economist is more pessimistic forecasting 0.9% in 2017 and 0.7% in 2018. Even if we
split the two, that represents a 50% decline in expected 2017 gdp and 40% decline in
2018. The OBR also expects public sector net debt to hit its highest level since 1964-65
in 2017-18 at a time when the UK already relies on “the kindness of strangers” to
finance its growing twin deficit.

Horizontal abstraction is the simpler of the two to understand,
and the more common. Computer systems are built ‘on the shoulders of
giants. That is to say we no longer need to place individual pixels onto
the computer screen. We can assume a computer will draw a square if we
specify the dimension and coordinates of the center. That’s abstraction.
Today’s computers are even more helpful. We can ask them to draw a
rotating cube lit from a certain angle and the computer will do the whole
job for us. But, there are always practical limitations to this.

I want my cubes to move around the screen naturally but I am not
sure what physics model has been implemented. What will happen when
they bump into each other? If the abstraction is not thoroughly thought
through they pass through each other in a very odd way, breaking up
and showing me they are really made of triangles, the illusion of three
dimensions is lost. Whenever we work at an abstract level, we risk being
exposed to its inner guts at some point. Joel Spolsky, a computer scientist
who worked on Microsoft Excel, proposed the Law of Leaky Abstractions
to explain this. An example of his law in action is the TCP/IP protocol
stack that transports data over the Internet. The stack is hugely reliable,
yet I have to debug one of these stacks at least four times a year!

The problem is that the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is
designed to provide reliable delivery of information: internet pages,
my bank account and the like. But, the internet protocol ‘IP’ on which
it relies is only designed for best-efforts. When a link loses a packet of
information, the TCP has to retransmit it. This takes additional time. TCP
provides an abstraction of a reliable connection, but the implementation
is not as robust as it may seem, and the details leak through as variable
latency and throughput. This explains why your web pages sometimes
do not completely render. You are told it is reliable, but often it is not!
Experience is so valuable to a programmer because they know which of
these specifications to take with a pinch of salt and when they are likely
to leak. They are battle scarred by previous naivety.

I think Spolsky’s Law follows from Rice’s Theorem and ultimately
from Turing’s no halting proof. If leak-less abstraction was possible you
could, in principle, write a recursive partial halting solution. By layering
abstraction on top of abstraction you would be able to solve some very
complex problems, eventually including the Halting Problem. We know
this is impossible, so non-leaky abstraction cannot exist.

The other method of splitting software is vertically. This is often
done following the natural boundaries of an organization: functional or
geographic. Again there will be leakage between the systems; the data
you get from the finance department might not be detailed enough for

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015529.txt,"﻿10/5/2015 Jeffrey Epstein 'sex slave' Virginia Roberts was a 'money­hungry sex kitten', ex friends claim | Daily Mail Online
'millionaire's house' for a day or two, before returning with cash.
He did say that she tried to get out of the sex business, but was dragged back in.
Last month it was revealed Roberts accused two male acquaintances she was raped, bringing her
credibility into question.
Roberts' lawyers says the latest allegations do not contend the fact she was used for underage sex.
Attorney Sigrid McCawleysaid : 'To say that our client acquiesced in this abuse, or that the abuse
was OK because she was paid for it — leaves out the fact that this is why we have laws in the United
States to protect minor children who are groomed and sexually trafficked by adults.'
Epstein served 13 months in a Florida prison after pleading guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for
prostitution.

The scandal resurfaced in January when Roberts named Prince Andrew in a lawsuit, accusing him
of using her for underage sex.
According to court records connected with Roberts' current lawsuit, she maintains that she was
recruited to join Epstein's harem in 1999 by his friend, the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.
She says during the three years she worked for Epstein, she was made to entertain his friends and
named Prince Andrew and Dershowitz as two men she had sex with.
Both men have denied having sex with Roberts, and Dershowitz is trying to get his name removed
from the suit, claiming Roberts made the entire story up.

Case 1:15-cv-07433 Document 1 Filed 09/21/15 Page 2 of 12
Plaintiff, VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE, formerly known as Virginia Roberts
(“Giuffre”), for her Complaint against Defendant, GHISLAINE MAXWELL (“Maxwell”), avers
upon personal knowledge as to her own acts and status and otherwise upon information and
belief:
NATURE OF THE ACTION
1. This suit arises out of Defendant Maxwell’s defamatory statements against
Plaintiff Giuffre. As described below, Giuffre was a victim of sexual trafficking and abuse while
she was a minor child. Defendant Maxwell not only facilitated that sexual abuse but, most
recently, wrongfully subjected Giuffre to public ridicule, contempt and disgrace by, among other
things, calling Giuffre a liar in published statements with the malicious intent of discrediting and
further damaging Giuffre worldwide.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
2. This is an action for damages in an amount in excess of the minimum
jurisdictional limits of this Court.
3. This Court has jurisdiction over this dispute pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1332
(diversity jurisdiction) as Giuffre and Maxwell are citizens of different states and the amount in
controversy exceeds seventy-five thousand ($75,000), exclusive of interest and costs.
4. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Maxwell. Maxwell resides in New York
City, and this action arose, and defamatory statements were made, within the Southern District of
New York.
5. Venue is proper in this Court as the cause of action arose within the jurisdiction of
this Court.
2
Case 1:15-cv-07433 Document 1 Filed 09/21/15 Page 3 of 12
PARTIES
6. Plaintiff Giuffre is an individual who is a citizen of the State of Colorado.
7. Defendant Maxwell, who is domiciled in the Southern District of New York, is
not a citizen of the state of Colorado.
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
8. Virginia Giuffre became a victim of sex trafficking and repeated sexual abuse
after being recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein when Giuffre was under the age
of eighteen.
9. Between 1999 and 2002, with the assistance and participation of Maxwell,
Epstein sexually abused Giuffre at numerous locations including his mansions in West Palm
Beach, Florida, and in this District. Between 2001 and 2007, with the assistance of numerous
co-conspirators, Epstein abused more than thirty (30) minor underage girls, a fact confirmed by
state and federal law enforcement.
10. As part of their sex trafficking efforts, Epstein and Maxwell intimidated Giuffre
into remaining silent about what had happened to her.
11. In September 2007, Epstein entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”)
that barred his prosecution for numerous federal sex crimes in the Southern District of Florida.
12. In the NPA, the United States additionally agreed that it would not institute any
federal criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein.
13. As a co-conspirator of Epstein, Maxwell was consequently granted immunity in
the Southern District of Florida through the NPA.
14. Epstein ultimately pled guilty to procuring a minor for prostitution, and is now a
registered sex offender.
3
Case 1:15-cv-07433 Document 1 Filed 09/21/15 Page 4 of 12
15. Rather than confer with the victims about the NPA, the U.S. Attorney’s Office
and Epstein agreed to a “confidentiality” provision in the Agreement barring its disclosure to
anyone—including Epstein’s victims. As a consequence, the victims were not told about the
NPA.
16. On July 7, 2008, a young woman identified as Jane Doe No. 1, one of Jeffrey
Epstein’s victims (other than Giuffre), filed a petition to enforce her rights under the Crime
Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”), 18 U.S.C. ¶ 3771, alleging that the Government failed to
provide her the rights promised in the CVRA with regard to the plea arrangement with Epstein.
The litigation remains ongoing.
17. On or about May 4, 2009, Virginia Giuffre—identified then as Jane Doe No.
102—filed a complaint against Jeffrey Epstein in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of Florida. The complaint included allegations made by Giuffre that pertained
to Maxwell.
18. In pertinent part, the Jane Doe No. 102 complaint described in detail how
Maxwell recruited Giuffre (who was then a minor girl) to become a victim of sex trafficking by
introducing Giuffre to Jeffrey Epstein. With the assistance of Maxwell, Epstein was able to
sexually abuse Giuffre for years until Giuffre eventually escaped.
19. The Jane Doe No. 102 complaint contained the first public allegations made on
behalf of Giuffre regarding Maxwell.
20. As civil litigation against Epstein moved forward on behalf of Giuffre and many
other similarly-situated victims, Maxwell was served with a subpoena for deposition. Her
testimony was sought concerning her personal knowledge and role in Epstein’s abuse of Giuffre
and others.
4
Case 1:15-cv-07433 Document 1 Filed 09/21/15 Page 5 of 12
21. To avoid her deposition, Maxwell claimed that her mother fell deathly ill and that
consequently she was leaving the United States for London with no plans of ever returning. In
fact, however, within weeks of using that excuse to avoid testifying, Maxwell had returned to
New York.
22. In 2011, two FBI agents located Giuffre in Australia—where she had been hiding
from Epstein and Maxwell for several years—and arranged to meet with her at the U.S.
Consulate in Sidney. Giuffre provided truthful and accurate information to the FBI about
Epstein and Maxwell’s sexual abuse.
23. Ultimately, as a mother and one of Epstein’s many victims, Giuffre believed that
she should speak out about her sexual abuse experiences in hopes of helping others who had also
suffered from sexual trafficking and abuse.
24. On December 23, 2014, Giuffre incorporated an organization called Victims
Refuse Silence, Inc., a Florida not-for-profit corporation.
25. Giuffre intended Victims Refuse Silence to change and improve the fight against
sexual abuse and human trafficking. The goal of her organization was, and continues to be, to
help survivors surmount the shame, silence, and intimidation typically experienced by victims of
sexual abuse. Giuffre has now dedicated her professional life to helping victims of sex
trafficking.
26. On December 30, 2014, Giuffre moved to join the on-going litigation previously
filed by Jane Doe 1 in the Southern District of Florida challenging Epstein’s non-prosecution
agreement by filing her own joinder motion.
5
Case 1:15-cv-07433 Document 1 Filed 09/21/15 Page 6 of 12
27. Giuffre’s motion described Maxwell’s role as one of the main women who
Epstein used to procure under-aged girls for sexual activities and a primary co-conspirator and
participant in his sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme.
28. In January, 2015, Maxwell undertook a concerted and malicious campaign to
discredit Giuffre and to so damage her reputation that Giuffre’s factual reporting of what had
happened to her would not be credited.
29. As part of Maxwell’s campaign she directed her agent, Ross Gow, to attack
Giuffre’s honesty and truthfulness and to accuse Giuffre of lying.
30. On or about January 3, 2015, speaking through her authorized agent, Maxwell
issued an additional false statement to the media and public designed to maliciously discredit
Giuffre. That statement contained the following deliberate falsehoods:
(a)
(b)
(c)
That Giuffre’s sworn allegations “against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue.”
That the allegations have been “shown to be untrue.”
That Giuffre’s “claims are obvious lies.”
31. Maxwell’s January 3, 2015, statement incorporated by reference “Ghislaine
Maxwell’s original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains the same,” an earlier
statement that had falsely described Giuffre’s factual assertions as “entirely false” and “entirely
untrue.”
32. Maxwell made the same false and defamatory statements as set forth above, in the
Southern District of New York and elsewhere in a deliberate effort to maliciously discredit
Giuffre and silence her efforts to expose sex crimes committed around the world by Maxwell,
Epstein, and other powerful persons. Maxwell did so with the purpose and effect of having
6
Case 1:15-cv-07433 Document 1 Filed 09/21/15 Page 7 of 12
others repeat such false and defamatory statements and thereby further damaged Giuffre’s
reputation.
33. Maxwell made her statements to discredit Giuffre in close consultation with
Epstein. Maxwell made her statements knowing full well they were false.
34. Maxwell made her statements maliciously as part of an effort to conceal sex
trafficking crimes committed around the world by Maxwell, Epstein and other powerful persons.
35. Maxwell intended her false and defamatory statements set out above to be
broadcast around the world and to intimidate and silence Giuffre from making further efforts to
expose sex crimes committed by Maxwell, Epstein, and other powerful persons.
36. Maxwell intended her false statements to be specific statements of fact, including
a statement that she had not recruited an underage Giuffre for Epstein’s abuse. Maxwell’s false
statements were broadcast around the world and were reasonably understood by those who heard
them to be specific factual claims by Maxwell that she had not helped Epstein recruit or sexually
abuse Giuffre and that Giuffre was a liar.
37. On or about January 4, 2015, Maxwell continued her campaign to falsely and
maliciously discredit Giuffre. When a reporter on a Manhattan street asked Maxwell about
Giuffre’s allegations against Maxwell, she responded by saying: “I am referring to the statement
that we made.” The New York Daily News published a video of this response by Maxwell
indicating that she made her false statements on East 65 th Street in Manhattan, New York, within
the Southern District of New York.
7
Case 1:15-cv-07433 Document 1 Filed 09/21/15 Page 8 of 12
COUNT I
DEFAMATION
1. Plaintiff Giuffre re-alleges paragraphs 1 - 37 as if the same were fully set forth
herein. Maxwell made her false and defamatory statements deliberately and maliciously with the
intent to intimidate, discredit and defame Giuffre.
2. In January 2015, and thereafter, Maxwell intentionally and maliciously released to
the press her false statements about Giuffre in an attempt to destroy Giuffre’s reputation and
cause her to lose all credibility in her efforts to help victims of sex trafficking.
3. Maxwell additionally released to the press her false statements with knowledge
that her words would dilute, discredit and neutralize Giuffre’s public and private messages to
sexual abuse victims and ultimately prevent Giuffre from effectively providing assistance and
advocacy on behalf of other victims of sex trafficking, or to expose her abusers.
4. Using her role as a powerful figure with powerful friends, Maxwell’s statements
were published internationally for the malicious purpose of further damaging a sexual abuse and
sexual trafficking victim; to destroy Giuffre’s reputation and credibility; to cause the world to
disbelieve Giuffre; and to destroy Giuffre’s efforts to use her experience to help others suffering
as sex trafficking victims.
5. Maxwell, personally and through her authorized agent, Ross Gow, intentionally
and maliciously made false and damaging statements of fact concerning Giuffre, as detailed
above, in the Southern District of New York and elsewhere.
6. The false statements made by Gow were all made by him as Maxwell’s
authorized agent and were made with direct and actual authority from Maxwell as the principal.
8
Case 1:15-cv-07433 Document 1 Filed 09/21/15 Page 9 of 12
7. The false statements that Maxwell made personally, and through her authorized
agent Gow, not only called Giuffre’s truthfulness and integrity into question, but also exposed
Giuffre to public hatred, contempt, ridicule, and disgrace.
8. Maxwell made her false statements knowing full well that they were completely
false. Accordingly, she made her statements with actual and deliberate malice, the highest
degree of awareness of falsity.
9. Maxwell’s false statements constitute libel, as she knew that they were going to
be transmitted in writing, widely disseminated on the internet and in print. Maxwell intended her
false statements to be published by newspaper and other media outlets internationally, and they
were, in fact, published globally, including within the Southern District of New York.
10. Maxwell’s false statements constitute libel per se inasmuch as they exposed
Giuffre to public contempt, ridicule, aversion, and disgrace, and induced an evil opinion of her in
the minds of right-thinking persons.
11. Maxwell’s false statements also constitute libel per se inasmuch as they tended to
injure Giuffre in her professional capacity as the president of a non-profit corporation designed
to help victims of sex trafficking, and inasmuch as they destroyed her credibility and reputation
among members of the community that seeks her help and that she seeks to serve.
12. Maxwell’s false statements directly stated and also implied that in speaking out
against sex trafficking Giuffre acted with fraud, dishonesty, and unfitness for the task.
Maxwell’s false statements directly and indirectly indicate that Giuffre lied about being recruited
by Maxwell and sexually abused by Epstein and Maxwell. Maxwell’s false statements were
reasonably understood by many persons who read her statements as conveying that specific
intention and meaning.
9
Case 1:15-cv-07433 Document 1 Filed 09/21/15 Page 10 of 12
13. Maxwell’s false statements were reasonably understood by many persons who
read those statements as making specific factual claims that Giuffre was lying about specific
facts.
14. Maxwell specifically directed her false statements at Giuffre’s true public
description of factual events, and many persons who read Maxwell’s statements reasonably
understood that those statements referred directly to Giuffre’s account of her life as a young
teenager with Maxwell and Epstein.
15. Maxwell intended her false statements to be widely published and disseminated
on television, through newspapers, by word of mouth and on the internet. As intended by
Maxwell, her statements were published and disseminated around the world.
16. Maxwell coordinated her false statements with other media efforts made by
Epstein and other powerful persons acting as Epstein’s representatives and surrogates. Maxwell
made and coordinated her statements in the Southern District of New York and elsewhere with
the specific intent to amplify the defamatory effect those statements would have on Giuffre’s
reputation and credibility.
17. Maxwell made her false statements both directly and through agents who, with
her general and specific authorization, adopted, distributed, and published the false statements on
Maxwell’s behalf. In addition, Maxwell and her authorized agents made false statements in
reckless disregard of their truth or falsity and with malicious intent to destroy Giuffre’s
reputation and credibility; to prevent her from further disseminating her life story; and to cause
persons hearing or reading Giuffre’s descriptions of truthful facts to disbelieve her entirely.
Maxwell made her false statements wantonly and with the specific intent to maliciously damage
Giuffre’s good name and reputation in a way that would destroy her efforts to administer her
10
Case 1:15-cv-07433 Document 1 Filed 09/21/15 Page 11 of 12
non-profit foundation, or share her life story, and thereby help others who have suffered from
sexual abuse.
18. As a result of Maxwell’s campaign to spread false, discrediting and defamatory
statements about Giuffre, Giuffre suffered substantial damages in an amount to be proven at trial.
19. Maxwell’s false statements have caused, and continue to cause, Giuffre economic
damage, psychological pain and suffering, mental anguish and emotional distress, and other
direct and consequential damages and losses.
20. Maxwell’s campaign to spread her false statements internationally was unusual
and particularly egregious conduct. Maxwell sexually abused Giuffre and helped Epstein to
sexually abuse Giuffre, and then, in order to avoid having these crimes discovered, Maxwell
wantonly and maliciously set out to falsely accuse, defame, and discredit Giuffre. In so doing,
Maxwell’s efforts constituted a public wrong by deterring, damaging, and setting back Giuffre’s
efforts to help victims of sex trafficking. Accordingly, this is a case in which exemplary and
punitive damages are appropriate.
21. Punitive and exemplary damages are necessary in this case to deter Maxwell and
others from wantonly and maliciously using a campaign of lies to discredit Giuffre and other
victims of sex trafficking.
PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Giuffre respectfully requests judgment against Defendant
Maxwell, awarding compensatory, consequential, exemplary, and punitive damages in an
amount to be determined at trial, but in excess of the $75,000 jurisdictional requirement; costs of
suit; attorneys’ fees; and such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

DATE: April 07, 2011
JS:
BE:
Virginia, Jack Scarola and Brad Edwards
Hi Virginia.
V: Hi Jack! Hi Brad! How you guys doing?
JS: We’re doing fine, thank you. I’m sorry for all of the trouble and before we go any
further, let me tell you, if I have your permission, I have started a tape recorder and I
want to be able to tape this conversation from the very beginning. Is that alright with
you?
V: Sure, that’s fine, Jack. No problem
JS: Ok, good, thank you. I appreciate that. Let me start off by introducing myself. I know
that Brad has spoken to you about me but I am Brad’s lawyer, and I assume that you can
confirm that you and I have never had any communication before. Is that right?
V: That’s correct.
JS: Alright. I have, however, gotten some information from Brad about conversations that
you have had with him, and that will enable me, hopefully, to make this a little bit more
efficient and take up a minimum amount of your time while still getting the information
that we think is going to be helpful to us and to any jury that might ultimately have to
hear these facts.
So, let me begin by asking you first to tell us what your full name is.
V: Virginia Louise Roberts. That’s my maiden name. My married name is Virginia Louise
*

JS:
Could you spell your last name for us? That is your married last name:
V:
JS:
Airight, thank you, and where are you living right now?
V: I live in Australia.
JS:
And how long have you resided in Australia.
V: Thisismyl9thyear.
JS:
That is where you are right now, correct? We’ve reached you in Australia for this phone
conversation?
V: That is correct, yes.
JS:
And what time is it in Australia right now?
V: I think it’s about 9:00 now.
JS: Ok. That’s 9am, correct?
V: That’s correct.
JS: Airight. Virginia, the reason for this conversation is because it is our understanding that
you know a man by the name Jeffrey Epstein, and I want to begin by asking you please to
tell us about the circumstances of your first meeting Mr. Epstein.
V: Ok. I was introduced to Mr. Epstein by Ghislaine Maxwell. I was working at Donald
Trump’s spa in Mar-a-Lago and I was prompted by Ghislaine to come to Jeffrey’s
mansion in Palm Beach that afternoon after work to make some extra money and to learn
about massage. She met me at the spa, and I was reading a book about anatomy, so I was
already interested in massage therapy as it was and not having any of the education or
you know anything behind me, I thought this was a great opportunity to work for her and
go. So, I went to Jeffrey’s mansion about 5 or 6 in the afternoon. My dad drove me
there. My dad worked at Mar-a-Lago with me, and he met Ghislaine and she seemed like
a nice, proper English lady, and she knows, I mean, you know, one time then _once
before I left to travel overseas, she just seemed really nice and like she would like to help
me out. So my dad left, and I had no problem getting home that night, one of her drivers
would take me back after my trial. So she led me upstairs, and into Jeffrey’s bedroom,
and past that is Jeffrey’s massage room, which has got his steam room and a shower and
a massage table, and there is actually an extra room that has, that nobody knows about it,
it’s kinda like a secret room and it’s got a whole bunch of decorative pictures of
pornographic literature and sex toys and I can ? what happened in there.
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 3 of 23
JS:
When you say that the room was hidden, Virginia, how was the room concealed?
V: It wasn’t like a door that you would normally go into, like some kind of special opening,
you open that and then a little door, so it looks like it’s a little closet so-to-speak, but
when you walk in there, it’s obviously a lot bigger than just a closet. It wasn’t too big,
but it was bigger, you know. It wasn’t a gigantic room, it was just like a small room,
which you know, it probably could fit some shoes in there, it had racks of shoes, boxes,
some sweatshirts neatly folded, and the ceiling to the floor was covered in pornographic
pictures of the girls that he had met.
JS:
Whenyou say...
V: So anyways, that was getting there, and I was introduced to Jeffrey, he was laying naked
on top of the massage table, and obviously for one, I’m a 15 year old girl and seeing him
on the table was weird but, also learning about anatomy and massage, I thought this
would be part of it. So obviously, I thought it was part of the massage program, so I said
ok, this is fme. And, he then instructed me on how to touch the body, Jeffrey’s body,
how to massage him, and for the first hour, it was actually a real massage, maybe not an
hour, maybe like 40 minutes or something, but of something like that _and that’s when he
turned over on the other side and to expose himself fully. So then Ghislaine told me that
she wanted me to undress and began to take off my shirt and skirt, my white uniform
from Mar-A-Lago, she also took off her shirt and got undressed, and so I was there with
just my undies on, and she was completely bare, and made some kind of little flake about
the underwear that I was wearing because it wasn’t my normal sexy girl underwear and
just like, I don’t know, had red hearts on it or something like that; just your normal, you
know, real cute underwear. Anyways, so during all of this I’m kind of like what’s going
on, how do I act, what do I say, I was so afraid of, not afraid or fearful for my life but
_unsure of how all this started and wanting to obtain a profession_ I was so afraid
thinking about upsetting and disappointing them, I don’t know, it’s a weird situation by
far and I was expected to _Lick his nipples, instructed on how to do so by J.E_ and give
him oral sex while he wanted to fondle me, and then at the end, I was told by Ghislaine to
get on top and straddle Jeffrey sexually, and when we were done, we went and had a
shower in the room and Jeffrey told me to wash him up and down, you know with a bar
of soap and make sure he was all cleaned up. And then he took me downstairs and took
me to two of the guards and told John to bring me home. John was the butler at the time.
JS: Let me interrupt you for just a moment there if I could, Virginia. You mentioned as you
were recounting those details that you were 15 years old at the time. What is your date of
birth?
V: August9th, 1983
JS:
And can you tell us please, as best you’re able to estimate it, what the date was when this
first encounter occurred?
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 4 of23
V: I’ve got it written down. It’s like - I’m not good with math — hold on — I thought I wrote
it down but I didn’t. I’m not too sure, I think it was 1998 off the top of my head and
around June of 1998, I would say as I was turning 16 at the end of the summer.
JS: Alright. You talked about the room where Jeffrey had the pornographic photographs.
Did you actually see that room on the occasion ofyour first visit there?
V: No, I got to see that room a few visits after but I was just trying to describe that room to
you guys so you knew exactly what room I was talking about.
JS: Another question for you, and I don’t mean to be prying into your personal life, and if I
ask you any questions at all that you’re uncomfortable answering, then you just tell me
that and we’ll move on, because I appreciate your cooperation and the last I thing I want
to do is impose upon that cooperation, but can you tell us please just generally what kind
of sexual experience you had had prior to this confrontation with Jeffrey?
V: Yeah, sure. A close family friend has sexually abused me, and I was on the streets at 13
years old. I was picked up by a 67 year old man named Ron _Eppinger_ who did exactly
what Jeffrey did with me abuse and violate my youthfulness — & I was with him for 6
months. So, he was gone and then I had this boyfriend who was like my school friend
from young days but we just kept in contact with each other and we were on and off
constantly, and that was Tony Figeroua_, and there was also another younger guy was
near my age, Michael, I can’t remember his last name, but yeah, there, I mean, there
wasn’t like a string of men or anything, but there was Ron, like I told you, and he was the
first guy expecting me to do so-called disgusting affairs. Jeffrey actually knew Ron,
which was quite weird when I told Jeffrey the story about Ron, and Jeffrey had actually
met him, and yeah. Anyway, just another story, and yeah, there were a couple of men,
but that gives you an idea.
JS: Now when you described the photographs in the room as pornographic, tell me just a
little bit about the photographs, if you would please? First, how many of them were
there?
V: At least 100, and like I said, they covered the room from the ceiling, not the ceiling but
from the top of the edge of the wall to the bottom of the floor. I want to say at least a
hundred, even more, there could have been more in the boxes _Some of them were A4_
photographs, like the large size, some of naked women posing, you know, positions, sexy
positions. Others were, you know, some girls had bikinis on, and it wasn’t so
pornographic, but it was all women, and it was all in a sexual nature.
JS:
Were there photographs where more than one person appeared?
V: Oh yeah, plenty of them. There were lots of naked photographs, I mean I was just trying
to give you a visual range. There was anything from 5x6s to 4x8s to 8x4s. Some of them
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 5 of 23
had frames, some of them were out of frames, but they were all, like I said, they were all
women, they were all sexual in nature.
JS:
Was it your impression that there were a hundred photos of a hundred different people or
were there multiple photos of the same woman or girl?
V: There was definitely a lot of different girls. I mean it wasn’t easy to sit there and say,
you weren’t finding 5 girls out of some photos, no. Were there a hundred different ones?
There could have been pictures of some girls, I really couldn’t get close necessarily to
actually recognize faces or anything like that. But if you, you know, the range of them
were all different, majority of them were different, yeah.
JS:
Did there ever come a point in time when you became aware that a photograph of you
had been added to the collection?
V: Yes, there was. Ghislaine took several nude photographs of me for Jeffrey. So, yeah,
there were pictures of me and there were pictures, he wasn’t shy, that wasn’t the only
place in his house that he kept the photos. He liked photos all over his house. If you
looked in his den or on his desk or in on the hail table, a giant hall table in his house,
there were at least a hundred photos of girls in frames. Not all of them were naked, a lot
of the ones that were all around his house were not naked girls posing pornographically,
some were pictures of celebrities and politicians he had known_or things like that or had
pants on or whatever, but yeah, there was a lot of mixed photographs in the outside ones.
JS: Were there any photographs of girls or young women that you knew or that you
subsequently came to know that you saw in the house?
V: Yeah, yeah, there was. There was pictures of Nadia Bjournik , pictures
Sarah Keller, pictures Emmy, pictures of me, pictures of the regulars, but a lot of the
girls, sometimes Jeffrey could have like 7 girls a day, and he would only see those girls
once if he got bored. I don’t know. These weren’t my days. I heard he’s gotten a lot
sloppier since I left. So, I don’t know anyways, but when I knew him, there was just a, it
seemed, there was such an influx of girls coming in and out, so did I recognize a lot of
them? Maybe, maybe not, but then they were all definitely beautiful, they were all
ranging in age, some of them young, some of them older in their 20’s, I mean it was just
they were all beautiful.
JS: You’ve told us about the first visit. Was there any discussion on the occasion ofthat first
visit about your returning?
V: Yes, they were very pleased with me and after the encounter was fmished, the sexual
encounter, he went and told me I did well and I have a lot of potential to become a
massage therapist and if I’d like I could return tomorrow, you know, and do the same
thing and get paid $200/hi, so Jeffrey insisted that I come after work, and over the next
few days, I guess the relationship grew into more, and within a couple of weeks, not even
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 6 of 23
a couple of weeks, maybe a week, I had quit Mar-a-Lago and I was working for Jeffrey
full time.
JS: Ok, let’s talk about your job .at Mar-a-Lago, if we could. You said that your Dad was
working there. What was his position at Mar-a-Lago?
V: He was a maintenance supervisor I think is what it was called? He like managed the
tennis courts and air conditioners and things like that.
JS:
What is your Dad’s full name?
V: Sky William Roberts.
JS:
And is he still living here in South Florida now?
V: No, he’s not, he’s in California.
JS: Ok. Is your Dad aware of what is currently going on with regard to your having made
public statements about your relationship with Jeffrey?
V: Yes, he is well aware of it. I told my family even before all this stuff came out, because
they were the first ones contacted by the journalists from Mail on Sunday. I know that
they the Mail on Sunday printed that I had gone out and tried to, I mean I think one of the
photos said that I was angry that I saw Jeffrey and the Prince walking together and that is
why I came out and went public with everything. Not true. I mean, I am angry about
how they are still up to their old ways together and that they’re still hanging out but I
didn’t contact the Mail on Sunday and I didn’t bring it out. I figured that everyone was
going to bring it out anyway and I better bring it out the right way. He’s known
everything from the start, and my family is very supportive with everything going on.
JS: I’m kind of going to jump around a little bit and I apologize for that, but since the subject
has come up, tell me first of all why you are providing this cooperation to us, and I am
certainly very appreciative of it, but I want you to tell us why it is you’ve chosen to spend
time with us on the telephone and provide this information that you’re now providing.
V: I’m out to help the bigger picture, you know, I think all of us can make a big difference in
a lot of other people’s lives and I think that this has gone on long enough and it’s a big
slap in my face that he can get away with hurting me so bad let alone so many other girls
and laugh about it. I guess I talked to you guys out because I want to see the right thing
happen, not just to him, but I want people in the world to understand this is not the way
of life, you know, it’s not acceptable to go out procure young girls and make them think
that, this is the way you should be living and that’s all. Yeah, I guess my reason for
doing it is to help the bigger picture, you know, I’m a big believer in karma and I believe
that good things will come back to you, so I guess that’s why I’m doing this.
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 7 of 23
JS:
Just for the record, neither Brad, nor I, nor anyone representing that they have anything to
do with us has made any promises to you. Is that correct?
V: That is correct. I’ll tell you, since this is our first conversation, that nobody has made me
feel like I’ve been bribed or bought or had to say anything. I’ve told you anything that I
know from my own self, not some things somebody told me. If anything, Brad’s been
extra careful not to tell me anything and let me do all the talking, so it’s quite opposite I
think.
JS: Airight. Let’s get back then to the story of your relationship with Jeffrey, and we’ve
talked about your first encounter with him and how it evolved from that into your full
time employment with Jeffrey, but what were you doing at Mar-a-Lago before you quit
Mar-a-Lago?
V: I was just a locker room attendant and sometimes I did babysitting for the rich and
famous. So, I wasn’t anything big. I worked in the spa area. That’s why I was studying
anatomy, because I was really really interested in becoming a _massage therapist, and at
the locker room, I didn’t do much. I mean I was making tea for a living, I would, you
know, make sure the toilet paper had a little triangle in it after everybody went to the
toilet, or wipe down the water from the basin, you know, it was a very easy peasy job.
JS:
Did you get that job through your Dad?
V: Yes, my Dad got me the job.
JS:
Ok, and you were only 15 years old at the time, were they aware of how old you were at
Mar-a-Lago?
V: Of course, definitely. We had to go through extensive, you know, we even had to get
drug tested and id test and so on and so forth. I mean, Mantas (?) is very strict on
employment, yeah, everybody knew.
JS: Ok. Was there ever any conversation with Ghislaine about how old you were before you
were taken to Jeffrey’s mansion?
V: No. She didn’t ask me how old I was from the start, but when I did get to Jeffrey’s
mansion, it was discussed how old I was.
JS:
With whom?
V: During the entire hour of what I call the legitimate massage I was giving him, it was cat
and mouse games getting information from me to find out who I am, am I a willing
participant in these kind of things, and how would I react if they were about to take the
next step. But they got information off of me, they got my age, they got my, a little bit of
my history so they knew I was, you know, not very stable at home, and they knew that,
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 8 of23
you know, I was actually interested in making my life better by studying so what they
were offering me was a chance to become a legitimate masseuse but it was getting
trained. They would have people show me how to work the body and be called a
massage therapist and get me books on it, and you know, keep me interested, and every
time, you know, I was with Jeffrey, literally was about massages, I don’t mean just going
in and have sex with him. I mean massage, because it would always start out with
massage and then it would lead into sometimes other things.
JS: Airight, once this evolved, into full time employment, what did full time employment
mean?
V: That was entirely having to travel with Jeffrey in every city. When he was in Palm
Beach, I stayed at my apartment, and he would call me to his house once or twice a day
sometimes, and that’s, you know, do things with him. Sometimes we’d go out shopping,
sometimes we’d go out and watch a movie. You know, simple things like that, go to an
expo or a fair, whatever it was. But when we were in other cities, I was at my
apartment, I lived with him full time. What I mean by full time is even in the middle of
the night, I could get a ring on my phone next to me and tell me to come in his room, you
know, so it was literally full time.
JS:
When you say that when you were in Palm Beach you were living in your apartment,
were you living on your own or were you living with members of your family at that
time?
V: No, after I quit Mar-a-Lago, Jeffrey offered to get me an apartment in Palm Beach
somewhere, Royal Palm Beach, and it was a nice apartment. He furnished it for me, it
was absolutely beautiful, but yeah, that’s the only time I would spend time away from
him really.
JS:
This apartment was on Royal Palm Beach Boulevard or out in the Village of Royal Palm
Beach?
V: I so honestly don’t remember. I’ve been trying to rack my brain because the FBI was
asking the same thing and were trying to fmd it, but yeah, I’m Not sur_. I didn’t get to
spend as much time in it, I was only there about an entire week out of every month
probably, but the majority of the time I was with Jeffrey anyways. It was somewhere in
Royal Palm Beach. I don’t know about Royal Palm Beach drive. I don’t even remember
the Royal Palm Beach drive anymore so I’m not too sure.
JS: Ok, let me see if I can draw the distinction for you and maybe that will help you to help
us? Royal Palm Beach is a village that is...
V: No, no, no, I got Royal Palm Beach, I just didn’t know the Royal Palm Beach Drive, like
what street it’s off of. Were you talking about a street?
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 9 of 23
JS: Yes, I was talking about a street. Royal Palm Drive is on the island of Palm Beach, and
it’s a street that is lined with large royal palm trees, and I’m wondering if this was an
apartment on the island or was this an apartment out west oftown...
V: No, it was actually in Royal Palm Beach, not on the island.
JS:
Airight.
V: I would be driven, it was closer to my family than it was closer to him. I wanted to be
close enough to everybody else so that when I was in town, I could just go see them
quickly.
JS:
Ok. So we’re not talking about Royal Palm Boulevard. We’re talking about the town of
Royal Palm west of town. Jeffrey got you an apartment out there.
V: That’s correct.
JS:
When he was in Palm Beach, you were generally not staying at the mansion, you were
staying at the apartment that he got for you out west of town.
V: That’s correct.
JS:
Ok.
V: I mean then there was times, I don’t wanna say that every time I stayed at my apartment.
There was times we’d fly back from some city maybe too late at night to really want to
go back home, so you know, it’s like 12:00 at night or 1:00 in the morning. I was just
staying in the yellow room, or something like that; one of the guest rooms in Palm Beach.
But majority of the time, I would definitely want to get back to my own apartment.
JS: Alight. What were the general hours of your full time employment when ...?
V: There was not set hours. It wasn’t like logging, and you know, hitting the shift button,
nothing like that. The way I would get paid would be, ok, if I was in Palm Beach, I
would get $200 an hour to massage Jeffrey or some of his friends and then go home. So
it would be like that. If I was traveling with him, it would be per massage, so I would be
getting paid per day. So I wouldn’t be getting paid on an hourly rate. He wouldn’t say
ok, today you’re going to work for me from 7:00 in the morning until 8:00 at night. It
never like that. I was on call all the time.
JS:
When you were here in Palm Beach, were you actually getting paid only for the time
spent massaging Jeffrey or were you getting paid from your arrival at his house until you
left the house?
V: From the time the massage started.
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 10 of 23
JS: From the time the massage started. Ok.
V: Sometimes we’d go there and I would wait for a while or talk with G’hislaine and Jeffrey
about something or we’d meet somewhere and talk about something. A lot of times, I’d
meet him upstairs in his room where he was ready for me. But then there was a lot of
times where it didn’t start right away, so he couldn’t really pay me from the time I got
there sometimes unless it was just paid from the time I massaged him til the time the
massage was over.
JS: Airight. Did your duties for Jeffrey ever include anything other than providing him
massages and sex in connection with the massages? Did he ever give you any other
responsibilities to perform?
V: I was asked to do the same things that I did to Jeffrey to a few of his fellow colleagues as
well. Those were my duties. He looked at it this way is that I was going to be a
professional massage therapist, and maybe I needed some clientele, so he had me perform
erotic massages on a few people.
JS:
Did that start here in Palm Beach County?
V: It did. The first one did.
JS: Ok, and how long after you first met Jeffrey did he first ask you to provide services for
one ofhis friends?
V: About 9 months, I think it was. It wasn’t a full year, it wasn’t 6 months, but between 6
months and a year, which is why I’m saying 9 months.
JS:
And when you provided services to a friend of Jeffrey’s, who paid you for those services?
V: Jeffrey would. I would get paid the next time I saw Jeffrey, so if I was invited to the
Breakers Hotel to give a massage, I would give a massage, I would go home, and the next
day when I saw Jeffrey, he would pay me for what I did. So, it was paid always by him,
it was set up by him, so he always knew what to pay me. I did get tips and things like
that, if you call it that, you know, like a hundred dollar tip or something from a few of
them, you know, yeah.
JS:
Was there..
V: There was always payment from Jeffrey.
JS:
Was there ever any discussion with Jeffrey about what was expected to happen when you
provided massage services to one ofJeffrey’s friends?

V: In a roundabout way, yes. In so many ways, Jeffrey really really had to train me, and that
was why Ghislaine said that she and Jeffrey enjoyed me so much was because they never
really had to speak much to me to tell me what they wanted me to do. You know, I
wasn’t waiting for you know, their directions. Jeffrey would tell me to go give an erotic
massage to friends. He wouldn’t give me much detail about it, but he would say to treat
them like you treat me.
JS:
Did he refer to it as an erotic massage or are those your words?
V: Erotic massage is my words. That’s exactly what it was, but he would tell me to treat
them how he wanted it, so I’d do what he wanted without having to say to me words
more. I mean, I complied with what he wanted because it was somewhat of a, I don’t
know, I don’t know how to say it, it was just very mindboggling how I let him have so
much control or power over me basically. The massages would be routine to what Jeffrey
wanted with my so called new clientele, and with their own words would ask me to
provide them with sexual pleasure after the massage.
JS:
Did you ever report back to Jeffrey about what happened when you provided massages to
his friends?
V: Of course, of course, and I knew that his friends were reporting back to him as well
because there were times where he would instigate conversation by saying you know, so
and so had a great time, you did wonderful, you know so and so gave me a call and told
J.E how it went...
JS:
Did Jeffrey ever elicit details from you? “Tell me what happened, describe in detail what
went on?”
V: No, but he would have a laugh, he had a laugh with me a few times about some of their
different mannerisms, I guess you would say, like some of them, one guy had a foot
fetish and that was really weird and I mentioned it to Jeffrey, and we would have a laugh
over it. He didn’t want to know details. He wasn’t asking me “so tell me what did you
guys do exactly.” No, he just basically gave me a slap on the back and said, you know,
good job. And we had some kind of conversation about it. I can’t recall any conversation
off the top of my head. I really don’t know one. It’s been that long. But yeah, we did
talk about it briefly.
JS:
Can you give me an estimate as to the number of friends for whom Jeffrey provided and
paid for your services?
V: There was about, you know, I don’t know, 8 guys possibly.
JS:
And are you able to name those people for me?
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 12 of 23
V: No, not at this stage. I just, some of these people are really influential in power, and I
don’t want to start another shitstonn with a few of them. I’ll tell you that there was some
erotic massages given to, I’m just afraid to say it to you.
JS:
Ok, Virginia.
V: It’s like geez, I don’t know if I want to, I’m really scared of where this is gonna go.
JS: Alight. I understand that, and as I told you from the beginning, if I ask you a question
that you are uncomfortable answering, you just tell me that, and I will move on, and I
understand that at least right now, you are uncomfortable answering, and I am certainly
going to respect that.
V: Thank you so much, Jack.
JS: No, that’s quite alight. I am very appreciate of the cooperation you are providing, and I
don’t want you at any time to feel that we are taking unfair advantage of that cooperation,
so give me the information that you’re comfortable giving me, and if we get to a point
where you’re uncomfortable, I will respect that and we’ll move on from there.
V: Ok.
iS: I want to talk a little bit about the traveling that you did with Jeffi~ey. About how long
into your relationship with him did that first start?
V: Immediately. I started traveling immediately. Not internationally until I think about,
Gosh, I can’t remember even, I think it was a year later that we started doing international
travel. Maybe like 9 months to a year again. Not too sure to be honest.
JS: So that would have been approximately the summer of 1999? Somewhere around there?
V: Yes. Somewhere around there. Somewhere around a year, somewhere around there, I
can’t pinpoint it exactly. But like I said, we started doing domestic traveling
immediately, so my first destination with him was New York and Santa Fe and the
Carribean, California, I would take trips with him occasionally. Sometimes we would go
to St. Louis or New Orleans or Santa Cruz. We were traveling just about everywhere I
think.
JS:
How did you travel?
V: Well, we took Jeffrey’s private jet, and unless I was being sent somewhere by myself for
what we were just talking about before, then I would travel on a what do you call, a
public jet, whatever it is...
iS:
commercial flight?
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 13 of23
V: Yes. Just a normal flight, an e-ticket.
iS:
Like the rest of us common folk.
V: But when I was traveling with Jeffrey, the majority of the time would be on the black jet.
iS:
Now, when you say there would be times when you would travel by yourself because he
was sending you somewhere, tell me about that. How did that come about?
V: So, one of his colleagues would be at the Carribean or Santa Fe or even New York, or
wherever, and he would call me up on those days where I am not working with him or in
Palm Beach with him, and he would ask me to get on the next plane to so and so and go
meet so and so, and that’s when I would take e-tickets. His secretary or special assistant,
whatever, would organize it for me and give me the details and I would just walk up the
line and they’d let me right through.
JS: Can you give me any ideas as to how many times it happened that Jeffrey would send
you off to meet some friend of his at some location outside of Palm Beach?
V: How many times it happened? I’m not too sure. Probably about 10-15 times.
JS: Ok. And on those occasions, how much time would you spend with one of Jeffrey’s
friends when you were sent to a location that you would have to travel to?
V: Only a couple of days. Only 2 days, that’s it.
iS:
And how were you paid for those trips?
V: I would be paid in cash upon my arrival back with Jeffrey. So, whenever I was back with
Jeffrey, he would count up how many days I’ve had, sometimes give me even more than
what I deserved, not deserved, but what I earned and give me a little extra.
iS:
Was there a daily rate for those trips or was that per massage also?
V: Per massage. With Jeffrey, I would be honest. I wouldn’t tell him I did 15 massages if I
didn’t. He knew he could trust me. He could always come back to the other person that
he sent me to give massages and ask them as well, so you know, it was always by per
massage.
iS: Alight. When we’ve been talking about massages, tell me exactly what it is we’re
talking about when we speak about massages.
V: Same thing I would do to Jeffrey. Again, it would start out as a massage, which would
start with them being naked, and me giving him a legitimate massage to begin with, so
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 14 of23
I’d start with his feet, go up to his calves, up his legs, buttocks, back, his neck, his head,
his arms, yada yada, and then it would be time to flip over, and some of the men would
want me to continue on massaging the front side of them and they would instigate me to
begin having sex with them or foreplay, whatever you want to call it.
iS: So routinely, these massages involved sexual activity. Is that accurate?
V: That is accurate.
iS: Ok. Let’s talk about the travel that you were involved in when you were on Jeffrey’s
private plane. Generally speaking, who were the passengers on the plane when you
traveled.
V: Well, Larry was the pilot, and then there was a short, small solid guy, I don’t know his
name, but he was a co-pilot, and then he changed and there was another guy brought in
later on. Generally speaking, there was always Jeffrey, sometimes Ghislaine, sometimes
Emmy, sometimes a whole bunch of other girls, sometimes famous people, sometimes
some politicians or yeah, just about anybody could fly on his plane. There was never no
any set routine who would come and who would go. It was an influx of people on
Jeffrey’s airplane.
is: I want to deal with these things separately in order to respect some of the reservations
that you have, so I’m going to ask you who the people were that you remember flying
with Jeffrey on his plane when you were personally present without regard to whether
there was any sexual activity that occurred on the plane or not. So I’m not asking you to
implicate any of these famous people in improper conduct, but just tell me what the
names of the people are that you remember that you consider to be famous people.
V: Ok, there was Naomi Campbell, Heidi Kium, there was Bill Clinton. There was Al (?)
Gore, there was a whole bunch of models, I wouldn’t really honestly be able to give their
names. There was Matt Groning the producer of the simpons cartoon, Jack CCousteau’s
granddaughter a lot of interior designers, architects, politicians. I am just trying to think
of as many names as possible for you. Off the top of my head, that’s as good as I can get
for now.
iS: Ok, alright, that’s fine. And again, I am not implying by my questions, nor do I want
your answers to be interpreted as your suggesting that any of those people that you have
just identified were engaged in any improper activities on any particular flight, but I want
to talk to you now about what went on on occasion on the airplane. Ok?
V: Ok. It was a lot of the same thing that went down on the ground. A lot oftimes, it would
be just be me and ieffrey, or me and Jeffrey and Ghislaine, or me and Jeffrey and some
other girl, sometimes Emmy, Sarah, and Nadia Bjournik. There would be sexual conduct,
there would be foreplay, there was a bed in there, so we could basically reenact exactly
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 15 of23
what was happening in the house. It would start off with massaging or we would start off
with foreplay, sometimes it would lead to, you know, orgies.
iS:
Were there occasions when you were in ieffrey’s company, whether on the ground or in
the air, where there were other girls present whom you knew to be under age 18?
V: Yes. There was a constant influx of girls coming in and going out. And we were all very
young. On occasion, there was some older girls, and I don’t mean older as in like in their
30s or anything, I mean like 28, 29, something like that, just very rarely. The majority of
the girls that Jeffrey actually met or had on his plane or in his house were under age.
iS:
Do you know how it is that Jeffrey established with any ofthese underage girls?
V: Yes, I do. He would send me personally or with other girls to clubs or shops, to pick up
anywhere, I mean we were constantly on the look for other girls that might satisfy
Jeffrey.
iS:
What instructions were you given about what to look for?
V: Young, pretty, you know, a fun personality. They couldn’t be black. If they were any
other descent other than white, they had to be exotically beautiful. That was just about it.
iS:
Who gave you those criteria?
V: They both gave us the instructions, and it wasn’t just me, Jeffrey asked most girls to bring
a friend and make extra money. They would use us young girls So that way it probably
looked a lot more safer to a girl that we were procuring to younger girls that were already
doing it. That was the way that Jeffrey had it.
iS:
Were you given any instruction at all on how to approach these girls?
V: Yes. Jeffrey and Ghislaine both taught me to, depending on the circumstances,
depending on the girl, you could offer them a job as a massage therapist or you could tell
them you have a really rich friend with, you know, great contacts in the acting world or
modeling world and he loves pretty girls, you should come back and meet him, make
some money, you know, we had a whole bunch of ways to be able to procure girls.
JS:
Can you give me any idea as to the total number of underage girls that you know engaged
in sexual conduct with Jeffrey during the period of time you had your relationship with
him?
V: I would have no way of estimating that whatsoever. I mean, there could be a hundred,
there could be more, honestly I’m not too sure how many girls, really. I wish I did know.
I mean like I said there were so many over the course of 4 years with Jeffrey.
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 16 of23
iS: Let me see if we can try to narrow it down a little bit. Is there any doubt in your mind
that it was more than 10?
V: Yes, there was definitely more than 10.
iS: Ok, what I want you to do is to give me the highest number that you are comfortable in
saying there were definitely more than X number of underage girls that I know Jeffrey
Epstein engaged in sex with while I had a relationship with him. How would you fill in
that blank? Definitely more than how many?
V: I’d say definitely more than a hundred.
iS: Alight. Did ieffrey ever help to pick out your clothes?
V: Oh yes. I mean he wasn’t out to dress me like a porn star or anything. He would always
dress me very classy, but ‘we’d just go shopping all the time together.
is: Did he ever express any style preferences in terms of how he wanted you to dress?
Besides dressing classy, I’m, you know, any other suggestion to you about how he
wanted you dressed?
V: He didn’t, like I said, wasn’t trying to dress me in any prostitute way or anything like
that. It was nice, classy outfits I was wearing like Gucci, Dolce Gabbana, Chanel, things
like that. He was buying me a lot of very, very nice clothing. It was provocative. I mean
I was wearing miniskirts, and tight short shorts and little shirts that showed my belly and
my cleavage and everything, but they were very expensive clothes.
iS:
Was there every any dress up role playing?
V: Yes. There was. Lots of it. Jeffrey loved the latex outfits Ghislane had for us girls, he
had bondage outfits, he had all different kinds of outfits, but his favorite was the
schoolgirl.
iS:
Tell me about that.
V: Well, you know, Ghislaine would take me to dress me up to surprise i.E or Jeffrey would
ask me to get dressed up, that would include wearing a tiny little skirt with nothing
underneath, a white collared shirt that you would be wearing to school with a tie in it, tied
up _in a bow, my hair in pigtails, stockings on up to my knees, and I would go in there
and act like a kid and we’d do role playing sexing.
iS: Did ieffrey ever brag to you about the age of any of the girls with whom he had
relationships?
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 17 of23
V: Yes, he did. He did all the time. The worst one that I heard from his own mouth was this
pretty 12 year old girls he had flown in for his birthday. It was a surprise birthday gift
from one of his friends and they were from France. I did see them, I did meet them.
Jeffrey bragged afterwards after he met them that they were 12 year olds and flown over
from France because they’re really poor over there, and their parents needed the money
or whatever the case is and they were absolutely free to stay and flew out. Those were
the worst ones. He was constantly bragging about girls’ ages or where he got them from
or their past and how terrible their past was and good he is making it for them.
iS: Where were the 12 year old girls flown to from France? Where did they come to?
V: Palm Beach.
iS:
And were they flown in on Jeff’s private plane or did they get transported?
V: No. They were transported by somebody else.
iS: Ok. Was the sexual activity that went on on the airplane conducted in such a way so that
any of the crew was aware of what was going on?
V: They were told to knock if they had to come out, if the crew had to come out. They were
told, you know, to come out as little as possible, so they weren’t out there hanging out
watching everything, no, but it doesn’t take an idiot to put two and two together to say
well there’s a whole bunch of half dressed teenagers on board with this old man who is
constantly being massaged by them and he wants me to keep the door shut for what
reason? I mean, only they could put that together, but yeah, they knew.
iS:
Did Mr. Epstein ever talk to you about people of power and influence owing him favors?
V: He would laugh about it, you know, I never really knew what to take serious from Jeffrey
because he was such a funny character at times. You never knew if what he was saying
was true or not. Yeah, lots of people owed him favors from what he told me. He’s got
everybody in his pocket, and he would laugh about he helps people for the sole purpose
in the end they owe him something. That’s why I believe he does so many favors in the
first place.
iS:
When and how did you first become aware that Mr. Epstein was in trouble with the law?
V: I was first informed by, I think someone from the FBI called me first and started to ask
me questions, and I started to answer the questions but then fear took over, and I just said
look, I don’t know what’s going on, I’ve got a young family that I don’t want to risk, you
know, please don’t bother me about this again, and it was real short simple conversation,
and within a week or 2, I had gotten a call from Jeffrey’s attorney, and then a week later,
Jeffrey himself.
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 18 of 23
is:
Ok, well let’s back up before we get to those conversations and tell me approximately
when it was that you were contacted by the person who you believe was with the FBI.
V: Ok. It’s hard for me to pinpoint, if I had to pinpoint it, it would be in 2007 sometime.
iS: Alight. And you were living in Australia at that time, correct?
V: Correct.
iS:
You were contacted by telephone?
V: That’s correct, by my cell phone.
iS:
Ok and do you have any idea how your name came up leading to that contact.
V: No idea. No idea whatsoever. When I did ask, I was told that some girls had revealed
my name, I guess, and that’s how everybody, the FBI knew to contact me.
iS:
OK.
V: But I don’t know ofthand or sorry, I just walked into the wrong room.
iS:
Ok.
V: Sorry go on.
iS: Yes & I’ll never tell her you said that. Virginia, how long was it after that phone call
from the FBI person were you contacted by Mr. Epstein’s lawyers.
V: Like a week. It was back to back to each other. I remember being so scared after talking
to the FBI thinking what’s happening, what’s going on. It’s been like 6 years, 7 years at
that stage, how did they find me & what do I have to do with this? So yeah, I do
remember that very well, and it was only about a week later I was called by his attorney.
iS:
Who was it that contacted you, do you remember?
V: I want to say Bill Riley, but he might have been from the FBI. No, it was Bill Riley. Bill
Riley. Not sure ifthat’s his correct name, but that’s what is coming to mind
JS:
What do you remember about that conversation?
V: I remember a Mr. Goldberger as well, I remember, there might have been two of them.
iS:
Airight.
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 19 of23
V: I can’t remember which one it was. I want to say Bill Riley is the good one.
iS:
Airight, so either Bill Riley or a Mr. Goldberger or both of them contacted you, and what
do you remember about that?
V: I don’t know if it was the same guy who contacted me that week later who put me in
touch with Jeffrey. I think he was on the phone and he put speakerphone on with Jeffrey.
So he connected me with Jeffrey. I don’t know if it was the same guy or different, but I
definitely know that Bill Riley was the first guy to contact me. I’m pretty sure about that.
JS:
Ok. Tell me about that conversation.
V: He asked me what I knew about what’s going on with Jeffrey and apparently, there was
an investigation being held about some of the girls who had come out and said that
Jeffrey had sexual contact with them under the age of a minor and that he was
discrediting lot of these girls and making them out to be drug addicts and prostitutes and
what have you so they wouldn’t be looked upon as worthy in the court’s eyes so to speak.
And you know, he told me in the first five minutes that, you know, if I stay quiet, that
“I’ll be looked after”. And that was the exact way it was said. It wasn’t like you know,
I’m gonna pay you a zillion dollars or anything if you be quiet, but if I stay quiet, I would
“looked after”. And I remember saying I don’t want any part to do with this. You know,
this is not something I want to be a part of, I’ve got a young family. I wish the best for
everybody in this, you know, take care kind of thing. A week later, I was called after the
hearing by one of Jeffrey’s lawyers. I can’t tell you exactly which one it was but he had
Jeffrey on the other line and he connected Jeffrey and I, and Jeffrey tried to make some
simple conversation, “How are you? How have things been?” You know what I mean,
catching up.
JS:
Do you know if the lawyer, did the lawyer stay on the line while Jeffrey was speaking to
you?
V: I’m pretty sure he did. That’s why I think ieffrey was on speaker phone because it
sounded a lot different, and I was never taken off the line to begin with or connected to
another line, so I was pretty sure Jeffrey was on speaker phone and the lawyer was
making the call. After the simple conversation, it led to what was going on again and you
know, Jeffrey couldn’t believe it. You know, he thought he helped all these girls out. He
didn’t think he was wrong in any circumstance here at all. A lot of these girls were drug
addicts and just after drug money. You know, he was really putting down these women
or these girls I should say, not giving them the credit they deserved, and then he exactly
repeated what the lawyer said the week before is that he would look after me if I stayed
quiet, and if I need any help, you know, his lawyers would represent me and he would get
legal help for me, whatever I need, he would do, and I told him exactly, I said, “Jeffrey,
I’m the mother of two children at that stage. I’m away from everything there, I don’t
want to be a part of it. I’m not going to speak to anybody and I don’t want to speak to
anybody, I don’t want to be involved.” That was the last time I heard from him. And the
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 20 of 23
next thing I knew, I was sent my victim’s letter, my notification of being a victim through
the US Attorney’s Office and that’s when I knew it was well out there enough not to have
Jeffrey’s lawyers come back on me and discredit me in the same way he had done to all
the other girls. So, I called up Joseph Bird who was the recommended lawyers on my
paperwork that they had given me and started going from there.
JS:
So you contact Mr. ioseph Bergs’ office and then you were dealing with his office from
that point forward.
V: That’s correct.
iS: Tell me about the ending of your relationship with Jeffrey. That is, at what point in time
did your full time employment end and how did that happen?
V: Ok. So, it hadn’t really ended. I walked away from it all. Jeffrey sent me to Thailand
where I met my husband and escaped to Australia, never to return back to the states.
About 6 months prior to that, he came up with a proposition that I thought was really
disgustingly sick. And it really showed me for the first time in 4 years I had been with
him that nothing was going to change and I was always just going to be used by him(?)
which I did not like. He offered me a mansion and some of his money every month, I
forget what he called it, a monthly income of what he made to bear one of his children.
The proposition was that if anything ever happened between Jeffrey and I, that I would
have to sign my child over to him basically and that the child would be his and
Ghislaine’s, and I would be looking after it as long as nothing happened between Jeffrey
and I. So, I was kind of freaked out by all of that. I pushed Jeffrey more to please get me
some more training, you know, and I was getting older and not of as much interest to
Jeffrey anyways. I was 19 now, and he likes a female a lot younger. So he sent me to
Thailand, in September 2002. I was first supposed to meet a girl there and bring her
back with me, but I never met up with her. I proceeded get a short course in Thai massage
so that was to shut me up about my training so I went there, and one of my friends from
school invited me to watch a fight, like a muay thai fight, which is like a form
kickboxing. So I went and watched it, and I saw this guy that was a really good fighter,
and a girl’s word, looked really hot, so I asked my friend who knew him to introduce me.
We got introduced and fell in love immediately, 3 days later Rob proposed and 7 days
later I was being married in a buddist temple. I called Jeffrey and told him I’m sorry, I’m
never coming back. I’ve gotten married, I’ve fallen in love. I thought he’d wish the best
for me but he was kind of rude and he just said “have a good life” and hung up the phone,
and that was the last time I’d talked to him ever until all this started again.
iS: Ok. Virginia, is there anything else that you would like to add to what you have told us
up to this point in time?
V: I’d like to know that this time around something’s going to be done about it and that
Jeffrey and a lot of his colleagues, no matter how rich they are, will know that there is
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page2l of23
law and that there is people that still believe in it. So that’s it. Thank you guys for
listening to me, hearing me out and helping me. It’s kind ofhard to get through.
iS:
Thank you very much. Yes, I’m sure it has been very difficult and I am very appreciative
of the courage you have shown in doing what you have done, which really brings me to
the last subject, and that is what was it that motivated you to go public with all of this?
V: Sharon Richard contacted me. I like her, I do, I like her a lot. I know she’s a journalist,
and journalists are normally bloodsucking leeches, but I like her for that, but she is an
honest bloodsucking leech. She told me a lot about what was still going on, and she
showed me a picture of Jeffrey with a little girl who looks like she could have been 12
years old. I mean it was disgusting. I agreed to talk with her, I never agreed to do
anything until she showed me some pictures, and at that stage, being a mother of 3
children and having a daughter who I would do anything for to protect, I would put my
neck on the line to make sure she never has to go through what I had to go through, and
knowing all of this, and knowing that he’s still out there doing the same exact thing with
no regrets, no remorse, no worry about what he’s doing to those girls, and all those girls
feeling the same way that I did, so I, you know, I’m doing it because I believe in my heart
of hearts it’s the right thing to do. It’s what I would want somebody to do for my
daughter or my sister or my friend, and it saddens me to know that it’s still going on right
now. It’s like the seashell story. I don’t know if you’re heard the story about the little kid
who throws back a starfish, you know, the little brother tries to ask his sister, “why do
you throw them in, they’re all gonna die anyways, the little girl says “well, it’s this one
that I can help, and this one that I can help,” and that’s what I feel like I’m doing. I’m
making a small dent in this big world we live in.
iS: I certainly appreciate that courage, and I have heard that story, and you’re absolutely
right, that one person may not be able to make a difference for everyone, but one person
can make a difference for someone, and hopefully, you are making a difference for
someone, and we’re gonna do the best we can to make sure you are making a difference
for as many people as possible.
V: Thanks iack.
iS: Just a few other follow up things I want to ask you and again, if any of these questions
are questions that you’re uncomfortable in responding to, then don’t hesitate to tell me
that. Do you have any recollection of ieffrey Epstein’s specifically telling you that “Bill
Clinton owes me favors”?
V: Yes. I do. It was a laugh though. He would laugh it off. You know, I remember asking
Jeffrey what’s Bill Clinton doing here kind of thing, and he laughed it off and said well
he owes me a favor. He never told me what favors they were. I never knew. I didn’t
know if he was serious. It was just ajoke.
is:
Where was here?
Edwards adv. Epstein
Telephone interview with Virginia Roberts
Page 22 of 23
V: He told me a long time ago that everyone owes him favors. They’re all in each other’s
pockets.
iS:
When you say you asked him why is Bill Clinton here, where was here?
V: On the island.
iS:
When you were present with ieffrey Epstein and Bill Clinton on the island, who else was
there?
V: Ghislaine, Emmy, and there was 2 young girls that I could identify. I never really knew
them well anyways. It was just 2 girls from New York.
JS:
And were all of you staying at ieffrey’s house on the island including Bill Clinton?
V: That’s correct. He had about 4 or 5 different villas on his island separate from the main
house, and we all stayed in the villas.
is:
V: Yes.
Were sexual orgies a regular occurrence on the island at Jeffrey’s house?
JS: If we were to take sworn testimony from the people I am going to name, and if those
people were to tell the truth about what they knew, do you believe that any of the
following people would have relevant information about Jeffrey’s taking advantage of
underage girls? So I’ll just name a name, and you tell me yes if they told the truth, I
think they’d have relevant information or no, I don’t think they would, or I don’t know
whether they would or not. Ok? You understand?

V: Don’t know.
JS:
Prince Andrew.
V: Yes, he would know a lot of the truth. Again, I don’t know how much he would be able
to help you with, but seeing he’s in a lot of trouble himself these days, I think he might,
so I think he may be valuable. I’m not too sure of him.
iS: Ok. Virginia, I think that’s all I have for you. Let me tell you what I would like to do.
As I told you in the beginning of this conversation, we’ve been recording it, and
hopefully, we’ve got a clear enough recording so that we’ve taken down everything
accurately and when it’s transcribed, it will be clear and accurate, but what I would like
to do is transcribe it, send it to you, have you take a look at it, and if there’s anything that
we got wrong in the statement, you can write back and you can make changes in the
transcript so that the transcript is accurate. Is that fair?
V: No worries. That is fair. No problem.
JS: Alight, great. I really do appreciate that and tell me what the best way is to send the
transcript to you.
V: Email. If you just want to send it by email or if you want to send it by mail, either or.
iS: Ok. Give me your email address if you would please.

Thank you, Paul. I had reached out to Joan previously to be included on Jack Scarola's e-mail distribution list
for the Dershowitz suit, but I wasn't sure if this would also be handled by them.
I don't want to double up or inundate you, as I know other ITN News colleagues have also been in touch with
you. I just wanted to make sure I was on your radar if Judge Marra rules next week.
Best,

Hi Brad and Paul --
I had reached out to you both the other week when the allegations of Jane Doe #3 first
became public. I am a freelance TV producer in South Florida, working with ITN News on this story. As
you can imagine, given her allegations against Prince Andrew, ITN is quite keen on covering this story as
soon as it breaks.

Hi Jack - sorry to trouble you.
But wondering if you know what documents are source for a new NY Daily News story - quoting what appears
to be a Juan Alessi deposition which mentions Andrew visits to PB mansion.
Daily News cites newly filed documents. I'm not aware of any new docs that quote Alessi on the issue of
Andrew.
Can u enlighten me?
Do you have access to those portions of the Alessi depo? Not sure which case it would come from.
Is the full transcript of our telephone interview w. 0 Virginia part of the public record?

- Airlines in structural decline: our European Airlines analyst thinks overcapacity
(networks set to grow 7% yoy to 2020) and competition from low cost/ ME carriers
is driving prices and passenger yields lower across the board.

- Negatively correlated to Oil: the sector is negatively correlated to the Oil price
and despite recent weakness, our Commodity Strategist expects OPEC to cut by
500k b/d or 1 million b/d. Should OPEC cut with firm quotas and a tight control
mechanism, they see WTI prices averaging $59/bbl.

+ Watch UK consumer confidence closely: the combined effect of the challenges
we identified earlier starting to mount for the UK consumer and the drop in the
value of the pound could reduce demand for and expenditure on overseas holidays.
This would weigh on the travel operator part of the sector. If the bulk of sterling
move is over the boost for dollar earnings like Compass will also likely fade.

¢ Peak returns: unlike Retail, T&L margins (98%ile since 2004) and RoEs (85%ile) are
close to all-time highs. We think returns may well have peaked therefore given the
backdrop of rising oil, weakening consumer confidence in the UK and structural
overcapacity in airlines. This is reflected in the fact that PBV are on 2.8x for the
sector, which is top quintile for the sector since 2004.

poured but we have something amazing because—honestly it looked like a million,
million and a half people, whatever it was it was, but it went all the way back to the
Washington Monument and by mistake I get this network and it showed an empty field
and it said we drew two hundred fifty thousand people. Now that’s not bad, but it’s a lie...
. And we had another one yesterday which was interesting. In the Oval Office there’s a
beautiful statue of Dr. Martin Luther King and I also happen to like Churchill—Winston
Churchill—I think most of us like Churchill, doesn’t come from our country but had a lot
to do with it, helped us, real ally, and as you know the Churchill statue was taken out... .
So a reporter for Zime magazine and I have been on the cover like fourteen or fifteen
times. I think I have the all-time record in the history of 7Zime magazine. Like if Tom
Brady is on the cover it’s one time because he won the Super Bowl or something. I’ve
been on fifteen times this year. I don’t think, Mike, that’s a record that can ever be broken,
do you agree with that ... . What do you think?”

“No,” said Pompeo in a stricken voice.

“But I will say that they said it was very interesting that ‘Donald Trump took down the
bust, the statue, of Dr. Martin Luther King,’ and it was right there, there was a cameraman
that was in front of it. So Zeke ... Zeke ... from Time magazine ... writes a story that I
took it down. I would never do that. I have great respect for Dr. Martin Luther King. But
this is how dishonest the media is. Now big story, but the retraction was like this”—he
indicated ever-so-small with his fingers. “Is it a line or do they even bother putting it in? I
only like to say I love honesty, I like honest reporting. I will tell you, final time, although I
will say it when you let in your thousands of other people who have been trying to come
in, because I am coming back, we may have to get you a larger room, we may have to get
you a larger room and maybe, maybe, it will be built by somebody that knows how to
build and we won’t have columns. You understand that? We get rid of the columns, but
you know I just wanted to say that I love you, I respect you, there’s nobody I respect more.
You do a fantastic job and we’re going to start winning again, and you’re going to be
leading the charge, so thank you all very much.”

In a continuing sign of Trump’s Rashomon effect—his speeches inspiring joy or horror
—witnesses would describe his reception at the CIA as either a Beatles-like emotional
outpouring or a response so confounded and appalled that, in the seconds after he finished,
you could hear a pin drop.

says we've looked and we can't find these records that you've
requested.

Now, it doesn't address the fact that the government
only typically retains records for a few years when they were
requesting records from 15 years ago, so it doesn't have the

indicia of trustworthiness to be able to say that this is

actually the fact because, of course, as we know, the
government regularly has to get rid of records.

So to use this letter to say, 'Ah-hah, he was never on

the island,' when we never got to examine him under oath and
say, ‘You traveled with him a bunch. Did you also go to the
island? My client says she met you there. We didn't get to

ask those questions, so we're in a situation now where that
letter coming in would be highly prejudicial because the jury

will wonder, well, what does he have to say about this? And we

haven't been in a position to be able to do that.

So your Honor, for all those reasons we believe that

Mr. Freeh should b xcluded, the FOIA letter should not come
into evidence, and again, we believe that the issue of

Mr. Clinton should not be an issue relevant to this trial.

Next, your Honor, they also seek to include
statements, hearsay statements and newspaper articles about

Prince Andrew, and it's actually not his denial, as I

understand it, Buckingham Palace's denial of the allegation of

my client. But again, Prince Andrew is not on the witness

in human history, so why is there so little serious discussion of what it might lead to?

Here again, the answer involves multiple reasons.

First, as Upton Sinclair famously quipped, “It is difficult to get a man to
understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.”!” For
example, spokesmen for tech companies or university research groups often claim there
are no risks attached to their activities even if they privately think otherwise. Sinclair’s
observation may help explain not only reactions to risks from smoking and climate
change but also why some treat technology as a new religion whose central articles of
faith are that more technology is always better and whose heretics are clueless
scaremongering Luddites.

Second, humans have a long track record of wishful thinking, flawed
extrapolation of the past, and underestimation of emerging technologies. Darwinian
evolution endowed us with powerful fear of concrete threats, not of abstract threats from
future technologies that are hard to visualize or even imagine. Consider trying to warn
people in 1930 of a future nuclear arms race, when you couldn’t show them a single
nuclear explosion video and nobody even knew how to build such weapons. Even top
scientists can underestimate uncertainty, making forecasts that are either too optimistic—
Where are those fusion reactors and flying cars?—or too pessimistic. Ernest Rutherford,
arguably the greatest nuclear physicist of his time, said in 1933—less than twenty-four
hours before Leo Szilard conceived of the nuclear chain reaction—that nuclear energy
was “moonshine.” Essentially nobody at that time saw the nuclear arms race coming.

Third, psychologists have discovered that we tend to avoid thinking of disturbing
threats when we believe there’s nothing we can do about them anyway. In this case,
however, there are many constructive things we can do, if we can get ourselves to start
thinking about the issue.

What can we do?

I’m advocating a strategy change from “Let’s rush to build technology that makes us
obsolete—what could possibly go wrong?” to “Let’s envision an inspiring future and
steer toward it.”

To motivate the effort required for steering, this strategy begins by envisioning an
enticing destination. Although Hollywood’s futures tend to be dystopian, the fact is that
AGI can help life flourish as never before. Everything I love about civilization is the
product of intelligence, so if we can amplify our own intelligence with AGI, we have the
potential to solve today’s and tomorrow’s thorniest problems, including disease, climate
change, and poverty. The more detailed we can make our shared positive visions for the
future, the more motivated we will be to work together to realize them.

What should we do in terms of steering? The twenty-three Asilomar principles
adopted in 2017 offer plenty of guidance, including these short-term goals:

(1) An arms race in lethal autonomous weapons should be avoided.

(2) The economic prosperity created by AI should be shared broadly, to benefit all
of humanity.

SCAF.

The clashes in Tahrir Square on April 9-10, which led to the deaths
of two protesters, were the most serious to date between activists and
the Army. The distance between the Army and young democratic
activists grew further on April 11, when a military court sentenced
the first blogger since the fall of Mubarak to prison for criticizing the
military.

In the SCAF’s March 30 “Constitutional Declaration,” it became
absolutely clear that, unlike Tunisia, the parliament to be elected in
September will not form a government. Articles 56 and 61 stipulate
that the SCAF will retain a broad range of executive powers until a
president is elected. Instead of Parliament acting as the sovereign
body that will write a constitution, Article 60 mandates that it is to
“elect a 100-member constituent assembly.” The big question now is
how many non-elected outside experts will end up in this “constituent
assembly” and how they will arrive there.

Of course, many still fear that Islamic fundamentalists will hijack
Egypt’s revolution. But I see that as an improbable outcome, given
the growing diversification of Muslim identities in the new context of
political freedoms, secular parties’ efforts to keep the Muslim
Brotherhood within electoral politics, and the profiles of the three
leading presidential candidates, none of whom want the Egyptian
Revolution to be captured.

In short, a successful democratic transition 1s possible in Tunisia, and
not impossible in Egypt. That fact, alone, should bolster the hopes of
Arab democratic activists elsewhere as well.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028629.txt,"While the decision to go seems to have technically been Ballmer’s, interviews with dozens of people inside and outside the
company, including many close to the situation, indicate that he had not aimed to leave this soon and especially after the
recent restructuring of the company that he had intensely planned.

Instead, sources said Ballmer’s timeline had been moved up drastically — first by him and then the nine-member board,
including his longtime partner and Microsoft co-founder and chairman Bill Gates — after all agreed that it was best if he left
sooner than later.

That was due to a number of increasingly problematic issues on the immediate horizon — including a potentially nasty proxy
fight, continued business performance declines and, perhaps most of all, that Ballmer’s leadership was becoming a very
obvious lightning rod.

Interestingly, Ballmer actually indicated that he had planned on staying in his letter about his impending departure, noting:
“My original thoughts on timing would have had my retirement happen in the middle of our transformation to a devices and
services company focused on empowering customers in the activities they value most.”

That sentence spurred much chatter inside the company, including the persistent rumor that Gates had dropped the bomb
on Ballmer. That sentiment was further underscored when Ballmer’s letter contained no reference or thanks to Gates, with
whom he has been tightly tethered over the last several decades. Its absence has been much discussed internally at
Microsoft, where ithas been seen as an unusual slight and a sign of a rift.

Gates also did not reference his longtime business partner in any celebratory manner in Microsoft's announcement. “Asa
member of the succession planning committee, |’ll work closely with the other members of the board to identify a great new
CEO,” said Gates, in the entirety of the quote about Ballmer’s retirement. “We’re fortunate to have Steve in his role until the
new CEO assumes these duties.”

Other sources cautioned that it was not indicative of tensions between the pair, but was done to minimize “lame duck
concerns’ that might arise if Ballmer was portrayed as already out the door.

Those sources also insist that Gates never asked Ballmer to step down sooner, although they acknowledge that he also did
not — as Gates had in the past — disagree that it was best that he move on.

“Did Gates instigate it? No,” said one source with knowledge of the situation. “But was he as supportive of Ballmer as he had
been in the past? Maybe not.”

That was still a big change, of course. Gates — who has always been and remains the key decision-maker on Microsoft's
board — had always been Ballmer’s major backer, despite increasing pressure both externally and from other directors for
him to step down.

Gates had rejected such suggestions for years. That included former director and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, who many
sources said had been one of the first to urge that the company replace Ballmer as CEO, as well as from a spate of Wall
Street investors complaining about the company’s declining value in the Ballmer years.

As AllThingsD’s John Paczkowski wrote on Friday: “Here’s one metric by which Ballmer will be judged harshly. On the last
day of 1999, the day before he took over as CEO, Microsoft’s market capitalization was $600 billion. On the day before he
announced his intention to retire, it was less than $270 billion.”

That’s a damning number, of course, coupled with a widespread sentiment that Ballmer had missed critical trends in tech
under his tenure. Despite a strong growth in revenue, investors and others had long concluded that Microsoft had thrived
when Gates was CEO and waned under Ballmer’s rule.

Still, until recently, there has been no signal from the company indicating any change in top leadership. In fact, the
management reorganization backed strongly by the board a month ago had essentially placed Ballmer at the center of the
structure under a plan described as “One Microsoft.”

And, at the time of the restructuring announcement in July, Ballmer’s definite and clear message was that he was there to
stay:

“Lots of change. Butin all of this, many key things remains the same. Our incredible people, our spirit, our commitment, our
belief in the transformative power of technology — our Microsoft technology — to make the world a better place for billions
of people and millions of businesses around the world. It’s why | come to work inspired every day. It’s why we’ve evolved
before, and why we're evolving now. Because we’re not done. Let’s go.”

Though early in its rollout, the changes have been jarring and created a level of chaos at the company that has led to much
grumbling internally. It also did not help that the restructuring was quickly followed by a dismal Q4 performance by Microsoft.

Agreement to Defer Prosecution to the State, an agreement without precedent and fraught
with substantial practical and legal hurdles to its implementation.

6. THE SDFL DID NOT DEFER TO THE STATE.
Sloman’s Letter:
e “{TJhe SDFL indicated a willingness to defer to the State the length of incarceration.”
Id., p.2.
The Truth:

* The SDFL neither deferred to the State, nor even discussed with. the State, the length of
Mr. Epstein’s incarceration. In a letter to the defense, Criminal Division Chief, Matthew
Menchel rejected the sentence contemplated by the State’s plea agreement, writing that
“the federal interest will not be vindicated in the absence of a two-year term of state
imprisonment.” See Tab 40, August 3, 2007 Email from M. Menchel. Of course, this
position is contrary to Section 9-2031D of the U.S. Attorney’s Manual (indicating that
the “result” of a state prosecution is “presume/d]” to have vindicated the federal interest).
It is understandable, therefore, that Mr. Sloman might want to retreat from it now.
Indeed, the final Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) restricts the state-court judge
from exercising any of his rightful discretion and to specifically prohibit the judge from
offering probation, community control or any other alternative in lieu of incarceration.
DPA,  2(a).

7. SUGGESTION OF ADDITIONAL STATE PLEA
Mr. Sloman’s Letter:

e The parties considered: “as suggested by [the defense], a plea to state charges
encompassing Epstein’s conduct.” See Tab 1, May 19, 2008 Letter from J. Sloman, p.2,

q2.

The Truth:

e It was the government, and not the defense, that suggested a plea to state charges to
resolve the federal investigation. Andrew Lourie proposed declining prosecution in favor
of the state. Although Mr. Epstein and the State Attorney’s Office had already reached
a plea agreement, in August 2007, Mr. Sloman and AUSA Marie Villafana warned that
they intended to prosecute Epstein federally unless his counsel (i.e., not the U.S.
Attorney’s Office) sought more stringent conditions to the State’s proposed plea
agreement. These stringent conditions included, among other things, the two-year prison
term demanded by Mr. Menchel (discussed above) and a charge requiring him to register
as a sex offender.

When the Catholic Church [forbade cousin marriage] in the eighth
century, it wasn’t thinking about the effect on kinship. It was acting
in a self-interested way, because by cutting off these ways of kin-
groups’ keeping property, the Church ended up being the beneficiary.
So if a woman didn’t marry and didn’t have children but had a big
estate, she tended to donate it to the Church. So the Church helped
effect in Europe the breakdown of extended kinship very, very early.
Even in the beginning of the Middle Ages, people owned property as
individuals. Women could hold property — they could sell it,
alienate it, in ways that they still can’t in parts of the Arab world.
And this meant that individualism became very deeply rooted in
European society. So some individualism was already established by
the time Europe got to feudalism. And feudalism is basically a
contract — it’s one that is very hierarchical, between a stronger and
weaker person, but it is a contract between two people.

So the idea of exchange and private property dates way, way back,
hundreds of years before the Enlightenment, Reformation, etc. So I
think that the basis for European modernization traces all the way
back to developments like that. In China, in India, the exit out of
kinship was accomplished through political power, via a state that
tried to create impersonal government layered on top of a kin-based
society. And those kin-groups really never went away. Even in
contemporary China and India, in certain parts there are still kin-
groups that influence politics.

SHAFFER: But China had an impersonal government — a
meritocratic bureaucracy — without Christianity, and long before the
West did, yes?

of censored artists were invited to read from and discuss works banned by repressive regimes. I
had been part of a team of lawyers assembled to help Havel and other Czeck dissidents get out of
prison in the 1970s. The American readers included Garrison Keillor, Marvin Hamlisch, Peter
Ustinov, William Warfield, Martin Garbus, and Maurice Sendak. I was honored to be included
among them. My mother loved showing her friends the Carnegie Hall program, with my name
listed as a “performer.” She would tell them a variation of the old joke: A man asks a musician
carrying a violin case, “How do you get to Carnegie Hall? My mother’s answer: “Practice,
practice, practice law, like my son.”

My next encounter with Havel took place in Jerusalem during the celebration of Israel’s 60
birthday. Havel, Sharansky and I were on a panel together discussing human rights. When it was
over we got onto the same elevator. Remarkably, Mickael Gorbachev was also on the elevator.
(I knew it sounds like the beginning of a bad joke: “Havel, Sharansky, Gorbachev and
Dershowitz get into an elevator.”) Gorbachev turned to me and said, “You’re the big shot lawyer
who tried to get these people out of prison. You did a good job, but I did a better job. I’m the
one who got them out.” We all laughed and Havel turned to Gorbachev and asked, “Why didn’t
you get us out sooner?” Gorbachev replied, “I’m not that good.”

The struggle against real Apartheid

My interest in South Africa Apartheid began while I was editor-in-chief of the Yale Law Journal
in 1961. An article was submitted on the legal structure of the apartheid system in the country.
At that time very little was known about the legal aspects of this highly regulated practice, and
this lengthy draft laid it all out. It was my job to edit it so as to make it comprehensible to an
American audience. It was shocking to me that only a few decades after the Nuremburg Laws in
Nazi Germany, a “civilized” country, with a British and Dutch heritage, could construct a system
of laws based on overt racism and discrimination, under which racial classifications determined
who could vote, hold certain jobs, live in certain areas, be treated in good hospitals, attend public
events, enroll in schools and hold office. I was determined to help dismantle the system of
apartheid and actively joined in the campaign against it. But there were limits to what I was
prepared to do, and these limits brought me into conflict with some of the most ardent anti-
apartheid activists. Most particularly, I was not willing to support the “blacklisting” or artists

Day 3: Cryptocurrency

One view of the progression of digital technology has been roughly from amateur to
professional, from open to closed, and from chaotic to ordered -- as the early successes from
left field of Google, Facebook, and Twitter enter publicly-traded adulthood. At the ripe year of
2017, are there still digital disruptions to be had?

The phenomenon (and increasing literal value) of cryptocurrency -- and, for that matter, the
foundational blockchain technologies on which it can be based -- seems to indicate that there
are still surprises from left field. What does the rise of cryptocurrency tell us about the state of
cyberspace, and what should we expect -- and hope for -- next?

Jeffrey Epstein prosecutor was
previously rebuked for handling of a
child sex case

Julie K. Brown

Nine months before cutting a covert plea deal with sex trafficking suspect Jeffrey
Epstein, Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta was notified that the lead

prosecutor in Epstein’s case had concealed victim information in another underage
sex crimes case, the Miami Herald has learned.

The prosecutor, A. Marie Villafana, was harshly rebuked by a federal judge in
January 2007 for what he called her “intentional and/or serious lapse in judgment”
when she failed to explicitly inform him that the defendant, a Texas man who
traveled to Florida to have sex with a 14-year-old girl, had a prior history of
predatory behavior with minors, court records show.

Acosta, her boss at the time, not only knew about Villafafia’s breach — records show
that he subsequently defended it. Acosta assigned another prosecutor in his office to

13.4. Curriculum to School Districts of Traditional Classrooms (3% 2006E Revenue)

k12 piloted its core elementary school science program for several school districts, including Philadelphia.
The initial results of this pilot program were promising.

Case Study: William H. Hunter Elementary School

Background, In the Spring of 2004 the School District of Philadelphia wished to give a rebirth to one of its
lowest performing schools, the William H. Hunter Elementary School. k12 was selected as a partner to
provide innovative curriculum and professional development to implement a learning environment that
leverages the latest technology. As part of the k12 implementation, the District outfitted each room with
high-speed internet access, a ceiling-mounted data projection system, and interactive whiteboards. The
goal was to have Hunter become one of the District's, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania’s, first
web-based public, traditional schools.

Of Hunter's 600 students, 95% qualify for the federal Free and Reduced Lunch program and 25% study
English as a Second Language (ESL). Therefore, the move and the District's initiative truly marked a
tremendous opportunity for both Hunter's teachers and students alike.

Scope of Services. The fall of 2004 marked the official launch of the program and the k12 curriculum was
provided for all math, science, art and history courses. This included providing all curriculum components
including text books, teacher guides, manipulatives, equipment, assessments, art supplies and all the
online lessons and teaching tools for these subjects.

The Hunter teaching staff did an impressive job of effectively implementing the program. k12 trainers
worked closely with teachers to adopt the new curriculum and to share best methods on applying the
technology. Throughout the year, k12 trainers were invited to attend and help present ongoing staff
trainings. Additionally, grade level teams and school leaders worked regularly with k12 to develop
coherent plans for boosting student achievement.

Results / Conclusions: After the first full-year of implementing the k12 program, Hunter achieved
impressive gains on the state math exams.” In third grade, there was a 46 percentage point increase (as

When I was in the army, this wasn’t an issue. Self-control, especially in high-
pressure situations, was a highly valued asset. But in politics, I think that it did for a
considerable time inhibit my ability to connect with the public, or at least with
the news media that played such a critical intermediary role. And it caused me
to be seen not just as reserved or aloof, but sometimes as cold, or arrogant.

I did get much that I value from my parents. From my mother, her
boundless energy, activism, her attention to detail, and her focus on causes
larger than herself — her belief that politics mattered. Also her love for art and
literature. When I would come home from the children’s dormitory to my
parents’ room — just nine feet by ten, with a wooden trundle bed to save space
during the day — there was always a novel or a book of verse sharing the small
table with my parents’ most single prized possession: their kibbutz-issue radio.

As achild, however, I spent much more time with my father. He was my
guide, my protector and role model. Like my mother, he never mentioned the
trials which they and their families endured before arriving in Palestine. Nor did
they ever speak to me in any detail about the Holocaust. No one on the kibbutz
did. It was as if the memories were scabs they dared not pick at. Also, it
seemed, because they were determined to avoid somehow passing on these
remembered sadnesses to their sons and daughters. Still, when I was ten or
eleven, my father did — once, inadvertently — open a window on his childhood.
Every Saturday morning, we would listen to a classical music concert on my
parents’ radio. One day, as the beautiful melodies of Tchaikovsky’s violin
concerto in D came through the radio, I was struck by the almost trancelike look
that came over my father’s face. He seemed to be in another, faraway, place.
When the music ended, he turned and told me about the first time he’d heard it.
It was on the train ride into Crimean exile with Itzila and Meir in the early days
of the First World War. The train took five days to reach the Crimea and
sometimes halted for hours at a time. Every evening, a man at the far end of
their carriage would take out his violin and play the second movement of the
Tchaikovsky concerto.

I have heard the piece in concert halls many times since. When the orchestra
begins the second movement — with the violin notes climbing higher, trembling
ever so subtly — it sends a shiver down my spine. I can’t help thinking of the
railway car in which my then four-year-old father and other Jews from
Ponovezh escaped the Great War of 1914. And of other trains, in another war 25
years later, carrying Jews not to safety but to death camps.

these huge flows would figure to be uncorrelated. Depreciation of either factor is a
steady drag on growth, while free growth is revealed in the charts and tables as a
bucking bronco which might be double-digit positive one year and double-digit
negative the next. No wonder that national accounts cannot reliably tell good years

from bad.

Another distortion in the Y=I+C equation is the undue prominence given to
consumption. Physical capital, in most views including mine, is only a third to a fifth
of total including human capital. Human capital is the lion’s share. Pure
consumption is most of consumption, in my view, but not all of consumption. If the
factors grow in mutual proportion, then, the ratio of total capital growth to pure
consumption will be much higher than of net investment to all of consumption. That
explains, | think, why national accounts have reported not a single year of negative
net product in any of the eight countries since inception. Balanced portfolios report
negative total returns every few years. So would net product, were it not dominated
artificially by the steady positive of consumption. It is as if a portfolio dominated by
investment grade bonds were taken as representative of a realistically balanced

portfolio.

Solving the Age-Wage Puzzle

I will now try to solve a feature that troubled Ben-Porath and has troubled many
economists since. I call it the age-wage puzzle. Age-wage profiles are published
reports comparing pay earned by all working ages at the same time. Since all
cohorts (same-age sets) are compared at once, as in a family portrait, age-wage
profiles do not show effects of technological growth over time. They show effects of
age and experience alone. What appears is that pay or wage rises steadily until
retirement or near it. Meanwhile human capital is present value of remaining
lifetime pay, and shrinks steadily as approaching retirement and mortality leaves
fewer future paydays to discount. Most students of human capital including Ben-

Porath reason that self-investment must end when time left for recovery in higher

invested capital.

TIIC announced the first close of TIIC 2 on December 30 2016, with aggregate commitments of €135m
from a group of high quality and well-diversified limited partners. First close investors in TIIC 2 include the
European Investment Bank and Edmond de Rothschild, both with significant commitments, as well as the
TIIC team. TIIC 2 is also supported by a number of existing investors, together with several European
insurance companies, pension funds and family offices. A second close is planned in the coming months
and the final close will occur before the end of 2017. We have received significant interest from a number
of European institutional investors, many of which are in the process of completing detailed due diligence
on TIIC 2. We are firmly on track to achieve a final close of TIIC 2 before the end of the year.

Furthermore, TIIC has announced the first exit from Fund 1, with outstanding returns. Three other
investments are in sales processes and should close during the next few months.

BRIDGE is an infrastructure debt platform initiated by Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management (EdRAM) to
enable institutional investors to access infrastructure assets with secured and stable revenue streams.
BRIDGE is a London based second generation debt fund sourcing and structuring transactions directly from
sponsors when feasible and one of the few independent debt teams only investing on behalf of clients. The
BRIDGE team has the ability to execute and deliver transactions as efficiently as traditional lenders as well as
negotiate terms and conditions bringing optimised yield and security to investors.

The BRIDGE platform was set up as a new leg of EDR’s Infrastructure, Real Assets & Structured Finance Team
striving to take advantage of the expertise of the infrastructure sector acquired when the team became a
global leader in PPP & Transport infrastructure financial advisory in 2011 and 2012.

The BRIDGE platform raised € 400m of new monies in 2016 and has successfully reached the €1bn mark of

I tend to focus on language acquisition and one kinesthetic skill, sometimes finding the latter after
landing overseas. The most successful serial vagabonds tend to blend the mental and the physical. Notice
that I often transport a skill I practice domestically —martial arts—to other countries where they are also
practiced. Instant social life and camaraderie. It need not be a competitive sport—it could be hiking,
chess, or almost anything that keeps your nose out of a textbook and you out of your apartment. Sports
just happen to be excellent for avoiding foreign-language stage fright and developing lasting friendships
while still sounding like Tarzan.

Language learning deserves special mention. It is, bar none, the best thing you can do to hone clear
thinking.

Quite aside from the fact that it is impossible to understand a culture without understanding its
language, acquiring a new language makes you aware of your own language: your own thoughts. The
benefits of becoming fluent in a foreign tongue are as underestimated as the difficulty is overestimated.
Thousands of theoretical linguists will disagree, but I know from research and personal experimentation
with more than a dozen languages that (1) adults can learn languages much faster than children®? when
constant 9-5 work is removed and that (2) it is possible to become conversationally fluent in any
language in six months or less. At four hours per day, six months can be whittled down to less than three
months. It is beyond the scope of this book to explain applied linguistics and the 80/20 of language
learning, but resources and complete how-to guides can be found under “language” at
www.fourhourblog.com. I learned six languages after failing Spanish in high school, and you can do the
same with the right tools.

Gain a language and you gain a second lens through which to question and understand the world.
Cursing at people when you go home is fun, too.

O,. would expect me to mention service in this chapter, and here it is. Like all before it, the twist is

a bit different. Service to me is simple: doing something that improves life besides your own. This is not
the same as philanthropy. Philanthropy is the altruistic concern for the well-being of mankind—human
life. Human life has long been focused on the exclusion of the environment and the rest of the food
chain, hence our current race to imminent extinction. Serves us right. The world does not exist solely for
the betterment and multiplication of mankind.

were not authorized to receive them, the same charge for which Manning was convicted. Even if
it went no further, the FBI would satisfy its superiors in the Department of Justice that it had done
its law-enforcement job. But if it pursued the latter hypothesis, it would need to engage in a mole
hunt for a quarry that might not exist. By doing so, it could open a Pandora’s Box of suspicions
that it, or the NSA, might not ever be able to close. When the investigation came to this fork in
the road in the summer of 2013, according to a source on the House Intelligence Committee, it
chose the former route.

Finally, there was the question of whether Snowden had gone to Russia by design or accident.
Whenever an intelligence worker steals sensitive compartmentalized information of interest to a
foreign adversary and then defect to it, it raises at least the specter of state-sponsored espionage.
It is acommonly accepted presumption in counterintelligence that a spy, fearing arrest, flees to a
country that has some reason to offer him protection. When the British spies Guy Burgess,
Donald Maclean and Kim Philby, for example, fled to Moscow in the Cold War the presumption
was that they had a prior intelligence connection with Russia. And Philby confirmed it in his 1968
memoir “My Silent War.” So in the case of Snowden, counterintelligence had to consider the
possibility that his theft of state secrets and his arrival in Moscow might not be totally
coincidental.

For his part, Snowden said that he did not leave Hong Kong with the intention of staying in
Russia, but that the U.S. government “trapped him” at Moscow’s Airport by revoking his
passport. He told editor of The Nation magazine: “I’m in exile. My government revoked my
passport intentionally to leave me exiled.” He added that the U.S. government “chose to keep
me in Russia.” Although he repeated that assertion over a dozen times, it was untrue. The US
government had not invalidated his passport for travel back to the United States. When criminal
charges are lodged against a U.S, citizen by the Department of Justice, the State Department, in
accordance with the U.S. code of justice, marks in the electronic passport validation advisory
system that that person’s passport is electronically marked valid only for return to the U.S. After
criminal charges were filed against Snowden, including the theft of classified government
documents, it advised foreign governments that Snowden was wanted on felony charges, and
“should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel, other than is necessary to
return him to the United States. It was simply requiring that his passport, which is a State
Department document, be used for him to return to the United States. Rather than preventing
Snowden from returning to the United States, or “exiling” him, the government facilitated his
return home. With his passport, he could have flown home from either Hong Kong or Moscow,
where he, like any other person accused of a felony, would face the charges against him. Nor was
it plausible that President Obama and Secretary Of State Clinton would conspire to trap a
perpetrator carrying incredibly valuable national security secrets in Russia.

The counterintelligence investigation had little difficulty establishing that Snowden’s trapped”
version in the media was not consistent with the actual chronology of the events. Snowden
claimed that the U.S. State Department had acted while the plane was flying to Moscow on June

1960, at the Hall of Journalists and invited all the foreign correspon-
dents in Moscow. Before television cameras, the defectors denounced
the NSA’s activities. Martin told how the NSA breached interna-
tional laws by spying on Germany, Britain, and other NATO allies.
Mitchell, for his part, suggested that the NSA’s practice of break-
ing international laws could ignite a nuclear war. Indeed, he justi-
fied their joint defection to Russia in heroic whistle-blowing terms,
saying, “We would attempt to crawl to the moon if we thought it
would lessen the threat of an atomic war.” The NSA review of the
case, however, assessed that little damage had been done, because the
NSA quickly changed the codes they had compromised. It noted,
“The Communist spymasters would undoubtedly have preferred
Martin and Mitchell to remain in place as moles, since their infor-
mation was dated as of the moment they left NSA.”

The next NSA defector was Victor Norris Hamilton, a translator
and analyst at the NSA. He arrived in Moscow in 1962, and like
Mitchell and Martin he claimed the status of a whistle-blower. This
time, the KGB provided a newspaper platform. Writing in the Rus-

© sian newspaper Izvestia, Hamilton revealed the extent of U.S. spying ©
on its allies in the Middle East.

None of these three 1960s defectors revealed what, if any, NSA
secret documents they had compromised. Nor did any of them ever
return to the United States. Martin changed his name to Vladimir
Sokolodsky, married a Russian woman, and died in Mexico City on
January 17, 1987. Mitchell vanished from sight and was reported to
have died in St. Petersburg on November 12, 2001. Hamilton, after
telling Russian authorities stories about hearing voices in his head
because of an NSA device implanted in his brain, was consigned to
Special Psychiatric Hospital No. 5 outside Moscow.

There were also KGB spies in the NSA who were caught or died
before they could defect. One of them was Sergeant Jack Dunlap.
He was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in his garage on
July 23, 1963. Although there was no suicide note, his death was
ruled an apparent suicide. NSA classified documents were later dis-
covered in his house. After that, NSA investigators unraveled his
decade-long career as a KGB mole. Dunlap had been recruited by the
KGB in Turkey in 1952. The standard KGB tool kit for recruitment

only because his term as chief-of-staff was due to end in a matter of weeks. Arik
at first refused to go, and Begin refused to fire him. Yet in the end, popular
pressure forced the issue. When another demonstration was called in protest at
Sharon’s continuing as Defense Minister, a right-wing political activist tossed a
grenade into the crowd, killing a young Peace Now member. Even Arik was
evidently shaken by the spectre of one of his presumed political admirers
murdering a fellow Israeli for peacefully protesting. Or at least shaken enough
to step down as Defense Minister. He did remain in the government as a
minister without portfolio. Still, Begin himself would quit as Prime Minister,
retiring into virtual seclusion, about half-a-year later.

Like the rest of the senior officers corps, I tried with difficulty to get on with
my own job. I imagined the contribution I could best make for now would be, as
Head of Planning, to ensure the mix of forces and weaponry deployed in any
future conflict were better suited to the task than in the Lebanon war. But I
didn’t believe that such technical failings or planning lapses, however serious a
contribution to the more than 650 Israeli lives lost, were what had mainly
caused the war to go wrong. The central mistake was what had bothered me all
along: the invasion was not a considered response to a particular security threat.
It was an overreaching exercise in geopolitics, with sleight-of-hand used to
evade the need to make and win support from government ministers and,
critically, the public. Even with questions still to be resolved about when and
how to withdraw the thousands of Israeli troops that were still inside Lebanon, I
remember wondering aloud to a few army friends, and to Nava as well, whether
we would look back in a decade’s time and see the war as “our Vietnam’. In
fact, Israeli troops would still be in south Lebanon nearly two decades later,
when I had left the military and was about to become Israeli Prime Minister.

Even as a two-star general in the kirva, | doubted I would be in a position to
help fix the deeper issues raised by the war. Any real influence would be in
positions like the chief-of-staff and his deputy; the head of operations; the head
of military intelligence. They were the core of the armed forces’ leadership and
had the most regular dealings with senior figures in government.

But I’d failed to factor in the effect of the inquiry recommendations. Within
days of the report, Israel had a new Defense Minister: Moshe Arens, who
returned from his post as ambassador in Washington. Among his first orders of
business was to act on the inquiry’s verdict on Raful and Yehoshua Saguy. As
chief of staff, Arens settled on a choice I suspect most senior officers saw as the

I responded, “If I wanted any of Mia’s former husbands to put the fear of God in Woody Allen,
I'd pick Sinatra over you Mr. Previn.” He laughed in agreement.

I have maintained a good relationship with Mia. Woody Allen eventually married Soon-Yi, and
they have adopted children. Their marriage seems to be working.

Both the Clinton-Lewinsky impeachment and Woody Allen-Mia Farrow cases involved sordid
accusation of improper sexual conduct by famous and powerful men. These kinds of accusation
directed against these kinds of men are grist for the media mill. Every legal and political move is
covered in detail. Everyone has an opinion. Litigating in such an environment is perilous. Every
mistake is magnified. You don’t learn how to manage such cases in law school. There are no
tule books. Experience is the only teacher.

After years of experience in dozens of high profile cases, I now try to teach my students how to
avoid, really minimize, inevitable mistakes. Here are some of my everchanging rules:

1. Never take a case just because the client is a celebrity or because the case is “high profile.”
Make sure the issues in the case are within your area of expertise.

2. Ifyou do take the case, don’t “hang out,” “chill” or socialize with the celebrity. (It is ok
to get an autograph for your kid, but that’s all.) Never assume the celebrity, or high
profile client, is your friend. You have an entirely professional relationship. Charge your
usual fee. No discount, no gauging.

3. Never say anything about the client or the case to anyone unless you are prepared to see it
in The New York Times or The National Enquirer.

4. Every time you meet the client, be prepared to be fired for telling him or her what they
don’t want to hear. Famous people often get bad medical treatment and bad legal service
for the same reason: the doctor and lawyer don’t want to offend or upset them and care
more about keeping the patient or client than telling them the painful truth.

5. Don’t pretend your celebrity or high profile case is just like an ordinary case. The media
is watching your every move, and every move should take into account the anticipated
media coverage. This doesn’t mean you should make or refrain from making the right
move because of the anticipated coverage, but rather you should consider (and perhaps
reject, but at least consider) what is the right move.

6. Remember that judges, jurors and prosecutors, their family members, their friends and

colleagues all watch television and read the papers. The media environment may have an
impact on their decisions.

7. Remember that high profile and celebrity cases tend to distort the legal system, because
the law treats famous people differently. Sometimes better. Sometimes worse. Never the
same. It has been said that hard cases make bad law. So, often, do high profile cases.

In order to move forward

I would ask that you realize that very unlike yours, My business is only comprised of my personal
attention and my personal time . Time that I was forced to grossly overspend on your various issues
last year. . As you are my very close friend I will not have you participate in a bidding process that I
have decided 1 will have this year for my time . (hopefully a more fair way to allocate ) I would also
ask that you keep in mind that though our deal expired months ago. (also keeping in mind , that your
understanding of the final payment terms neither reflected the emails or my memory, we finished it up
your way. ) I have answered every call Brad , joslin, Ada or you, have made . reviewed docs over and
over/ until once again, I was forced to insert myself strongly as I thought it dangerous not to. I made
serious dollar and time concessions last year.very serious I am wiling to continue to accommodate
some of your concerns , but I am, under no circumstances , none, willing to spend my time for free.
its not fair. After cleaning up Carlyn's mess , which was a few weeks and 30 million dollars . We
were both highly aware of the dire circumstances in which you found yourself last year, and in fact due
predominately to its seriousness. and those very circumstances I took extra care in our negotiations .
(you had claimed I had you over a barrel , ( a horrible position to be in with my very close friend.),
unfortunately I fear that if you are not cautious ,in the near future, another barrel will appear of your
own design )

I heard you when you said you believed 1 had already been paid for the work that is now required. The
art partnership has fully answered all your concerns and discharged all my obligations and more so.
. (FYI Carlyns art partnership that you referenced is similar in only its title.) You will also recall
that you required that my payments be at the end of my work not at the beginning as everyone else's .(
my work was never to include hours upon hours of training your staff). I eventually agreed, this of
course should make clear that the 2014 tax year that will close Oct 2015 is not covered by our past
agreement at all. I pointed this very fact out to you when I initially proposed a multi year agreement
right out of the box. you said you preferred not. As you said ,I have produced results to date, far in
excess of even my own exalted opinion of my projections. I have devoted a monumental amount of my
limited amount of time-- way, way in excess of our agreement. I will be fair, I am willing to roll in
the amount still outstanding from last year if that helps .. However, As my best student , and my only
one, you are now capable of doing most, if not all, of the required work yourself. I can put my
whiteboard away when you come to eat and just have fun, trade stories,. share moments ideas etc.. I
am of course always available to guide you as a friend if you choose that route . always . It will take a
great deal of your time , but you will not have to spend any more money on mine .

We are scheduled to meet fri at 430 , I leave at 5 am sat morning.

Yesterday , I again spent hours upon hours of my time with your office. ,( speak to brad to get
flavor) and you and 1 will discuss the results in gory gruesome detail on Friday. it mirrored many other
weeks spent doing the things that I don;t have the time to do.

In order to keep things in perspective, maybe reviewing an analogy I have used before with you,

might be helpful. You and your family are a 6 billion dollar corp. with an income between 250 -500
million dollars per year. It contains a few operating biz's , a large wide array of existing investments,

"
IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028043.txt,"I could see that Little Pines was a kind of fiction. All you had to do was take
a map and draw in the 40-kilometer line. In the areas nearer the Mediterranean,
in the western and central parts of the border area, it indeed covered territory
controlled by armed PLO groups. But in the eastern sector, there were Syrian
positions a mere 10 to 12 kilometers up from the border, well inside the
“security zone”. Not much further north were two full Syrian divisions. That
meant we’d be fighting not just the Palestinians, which was the ostensible aim
of Little Pines. We would have to take on Syria. As soon as those hostilities
began, we would have to destroy radar and SAM sites in the Syrian-controlled
Beka’a Valley further north into Lebanon. After the first costly days of the 1973
war in the Sinai, we were not about to enter a major conflict without ensuring
air superiority. Unless the Syrians retreated or surrendered, the inevitable result
would be a wider conflict, not limited to dealing with Palestinian fighters in
south Lebanon but paving the way for Arik to go ahead with his original plan
and push all the way to Beirut.

This wasn’t mere supposition on my part. In February 1982, we ran a
simulation exercise in the kirya based on Plan B. The result: Little Pines became
Big Pines. A clash with the Syrians proved inevitable, if only because one target
even under Little Pines was the main road between Beirut and Damascus. It lay
well beyond the 40-kilometer line. As the main supply route for their forces in
the interior of Lebanon, it was also of critical importance for the Syrians. So any
idea of a quick, limited strike to establish a security zone was fantasy. A few
days later, Raful chaired a wide-ranging discussion on Lebanon. Near the end of
the session, I asked him directly whether government ministers were aware that
our war plan “will inevitably lead to a clash with the Syrians”. Raful hesitated
for a second, but then answered briskly: “Yes.”

That assurance would turn out to be untrue. But my wider concern, as the
weeks passed, was Arik’s political plan, of which I was getting an ever clearer
idea from him. It struck me as not just grand, but grandiose. Part of it was to
obliterate Arafat as a political force, if not by killing him then by forcing him
and every one of his fighters from Lebanon, a country Arik wanted to place
under the unchallenged control of the most prominent of the younger generation
of Christian Phalangist politicians, Bashir Gemayel. I felt all that would be
challenging enough. But in Arik’s eyes, this was only part of a complete
reordering of our conflict with the Arabs. He expected Gemayel’s Lebanon to
openly align itself with Israel and expel all Syrian troops. As for the expelled
Palestinians, they would go back to Jordan where they would resume — and, this
time, win — their civil war with King Hussein. The result, with Hussein deposed,

Beginning in 2007, Wealth Destruction + High Unemployment Forced Consumers

to Save Again, Potentially Reducing Short-Term Demand for Goods & Services

3% average annual GDP growth (1981 - 2007) was helped as the average USA consumer:
1) Increased personal consumption as percent of GDP to 71% from 62%;

2) Decreased personal savings rate to 2% of disposable income from 11%;

Beginning in 2007, things changed as:

1) The average US consumer experienced a material decline in the value of his / her largest
investment assets (real estate and equities) from 2007 to 2009 when peak-to-trough
valuations for USA residential real estate declined 30% and the S&P 500 declined 56%;

2) Unemployment rose to 10% in 2009 / 2010 from 30-year trough of 4% in 1999, creating
uncertainty regarding future personal income levels;

3) Personal savings rate increased to 6% in 2009 / 2010 of disposable income from 2% in 2007,
as uncertainty grows and appetite for consumption ebbs;

All in, the key driver of US GDP growth — the US consumer’s ability to spend — is severely
constrained in the short term as he / she aims to rebuild savings and contain
spending. This raises the question — ‘How fast can US GDP grow annually over the
next ten years?’ Determining ways to drive GDP (and related job growth) is crucial...

war. It was assumed this inevitable progression deterred the aggression
in the first place, and the threat of mutually assured destruction kept the
world peaceful. Giving up this tenet of defense strategy was something
the American military just could not contemplate. Many people did not
think it a rational defense strategy; it seemed appropriate the acronym
for mutually assured destruction is MAD, but this was the status quo.

We now know our worry over Russian superiority was groundless.
The West’s technological advantage, founded on the invention of
computing and sophisticated materials technology, gave us a huge
advantage. In the only battle to be fought in the 20 century between
Russian and Western tanks, during the first Iraq war, most of the Russian
tanks were destroyed with no losses to American tanks. We know this
now, but we are talking of a time when paranoia over the Soviet advantage
was the common view.

There is speculation that Reagan had muddled intercontinental
ballistic missiles with all nuclear weapons. I do not think this is true.
Reagan was a man of vision, quite comfortable with using his folksy way
to convey sincere belief, and I think abolishing all nuclear weapons was
in his mind. It would have been a breathtaking moment.

In the end a rather feeble communiqué was put together and the
talks declared a technical failure. But, both leaders had seen eye-to-eye;
both were prepared to make major concessions and both wanted an end
to the old strategy of mutually assured destruction. Wiping each other
out was no longer considered a successful outcome! The meeting, and

presence of his own lawyers. In reaching this agreement, the President withdrew his constitutional
challenge to the power of a grand jury to compel his testimony. This was a serious constitutional
issue, especially since Starr had given Lewinsky total immunity from prosecution. This left
Clinton as the primary target of the grand jury. But there is grave doubt whether a sitting
President can be indicted or prosecuted. If he cannot, then there is even graver doubt whether it is
proper to use a grand jury to gather information for an impeachment. In my view, the President
could have leveled a serious challenge, on this and other grounds, against the grand jury
subpoena. Such a challenge would have taken at least a year to resolve. In the meantime, he
would not have had to testify.

But the President decided to waive this challenge and to testify “voluntarily.” What I don’t know
is whether at the time the President made the decision to testify he knew of the existence of the
semen-stained dress. There had, of course, been rumors of such a dress over the prior months, but
they had been denied by Lewinsky’s lawyer. The news of the uncleaned dress with a telltale stain
became public only after the President made his decision to testify. It is fair to ask whether the
President’s decision would have been different if he knew about the existence of the dress. It is
also fair to ask whether the President’s testimony in front of the grand jury would have been
different had there been no dress. We don’t know.

What we do know is that the President’s decision to testify before the Starr grand jury gave the
prosecutor an opportunity to trap the President once again into committing perjury — this time not
in a live deposition in a dismissed case where the testimony was only marginally relevant, but in a
grand jury proceeding where the testimony was central.

It also gave the prosecutor an unprecedented opportunity to videotape the interrogation so that it
could be seen by Congress and the public.

Again short term considerations prevailed. First, the President’s political advisors urged him to
avoid that day’s image of the President walking into the courthouse — the so-called “perp walk.”
The White House agreed therefore, to the making of a videotape which would later show the
President being evasive and perhaps even dishonest. Although the President’s videotaped
testimony was not as bad as many thought it would be — at least in the short run -- it was more
damaging in the long run than a walk to the courtroom might have been.

Ultimately, after the disclosure of the semen-stained dress made it undeniable that there had been
sexual activity between them, President Clinton had to appear on television and acknowledge that
he had behaved “inappropriately” with Monica Lewinsky. It was a low point both in his
presidency and in his personal life.

The day after President Clinton publicly acknowledged that he had behaved “inappropriately”, he
flew to the Vineyard. The next day, we were both at a party. The President gathered a small
group—including several lawyers—around him and began to discuss the case. He said that
following the unanimous Supreme Court decision refusing to postpone the lawsuit brought
against him by Paula Jones, he had no choice but to submit to a deposition about his sex life,
because Jones refused to settle the case. I told him he did have an alternative: he could have
ended the law suit by simply defaulting and paying Paula Jones’ damages. If he paid the damages

There is nothing the busy man is less busied with than living; there is nothing harder to learn.

— SENECA

For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every moming and asked myself: “If today
were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?” And whenever
the answer has been “No” for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something ...
almost everything—all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure —
these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.
Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you
have something to lose.

—STEVE JOBS, college dropout and CEO of Apple Computer, Stanford University

Commencement, 200585

L you’re confused about life, you’re not alone. There are almost seven billion of us. This isn’t a

problem, of course, once you realize that life is neither a problem to be solved nor a game to be won.

If you are too intent on making the pieces of a nonexistent puzzle fit, you miss out on all the real fun.
The heaviness of success-chasing can be replaced with a serendipitous lightness when you recognize that
the only rules and limits are those we set for ourselves.

So be bold and don’t worry about what people think. They don’t do it that often anyway.

Two years ago, I was forwarded the following poem—originally written by child psychologist David
L. Weatherford—by a close friend. He quit his own deferred-life plan after reading it, and I hope you
will do the same. Here it is.

SLOW DANCE

Have you ever watched kids
On a merry-go-round?

Or listened to the rain
Slapping on the ground?

Ever followed a butterfly’s erratic flight?
Or gazed at the sun into the fading night?

You better slow down.
Don’t dance so fast.

Time is short.
The music won’t last.

Do you run through each day
On the fly?

CHAPTER TWO

The Crime Scene Investigation

“Any private contractor, not even an employee of the government, could walk into the NSA building, take
whatever they wanted, and walk out with it and they would never know.”

Edward Snowden, Moscow 2014

About 15 miles northwest of Honolulu on the island of Oahu in Hawaii, adjacent to the
sprawling Wheeler Air Force Base, is a 250,000 square foot man-made mound of earth and
reinforced concrete surrounded by an electrified fence. Inside the mound is a three story structure
originally built by the Air Force in the Second World War as a bomb-proof aircraft repair facility.
In the Cold War, it was modernized to withstand an enemy chemical, biological, radiological or
Electrical Magnetic Pulse attacks, and used by the Navy’s operation center for its Pacific fleet.
After the Cold War ended, the huge edifice was turned over to the NSA, which had been created
as an intelligence service to intercept the communications and signals of foreign countries after
World War II, a mission which included vacuuming into its giant computer arrays telephone
messages, missile telemetry, submarine signals and virtually everything on the electro-magnetic
spectrum of interest to the US defense department and US intelligence agencies. Because it
provided a valuable window on the activities of adversary nations in the Pacific region, it was able
to monitor the ballistic missile tests and submarine activities of China, North Korea and Russia.
As the NSA developed it, this Hawatian base became one of its primary regional bases for
gathering Asian communications intelligence. By 2013, the Kunia base, also called “the tunnel”
by its NSA workers, had a vast array of state-of-the-art technology, including 90 Cray
supercomputers arranged in a horseshoe configuration, used to decipher and make sense of the
intercepted signals from China, Russia and North Korea. At the heart of the Hawaiian complex
was a unit with both military and civilian employees. A large share of the civilians who ran the
computers worked under two-year contract to the NSA’s leading civilian contractor, Booz Allen
Hamilton.

Keith Alexander, the four-star general who headed the NSA from 2005 to 2014, first learned
about the impending story in the Guardian on June 4, 2013 while he was in Germany meeting
with its top intelligence officials. Janine Gibson, the Guardian’s American website editor had
notified the NSA it intended to break a story based on NSA the next day. It took NSA
counterintelligence less than 48 hours to determine that a civilian employee at the base from
which documents were stolen had not reported back to work on June 3rd, 2013. It also
determined he had lied on his application of a two-week medical leave and had flown to Hong
Kong. The missing man was Edward Joseph Snowden, a 29-year civilian employee of Booz Allen
Hamilton. At the time of the theft in May 2013, he was still being trained as an analyst at the
Threat Operations Center. Personnel records further showed that he had worked there for less

no accident that the “frame rate,” at which we can distinguish that movies are
actually a sequence of stills, is about 40 per second. Thus, electronic
processing is close to a billion times faster.

e Size: The linear dimension of a typical neuron is about 10 microns.
Molecular dimensions, which set a practical limit, are about 10,000 times
smaller, and artificial processing units are approaching that scale. Smallness
makes communication more efficient.

e Stability: Whereas human memory 1s essentially continuous (analog),
artificial memory can incorporate discrete (digital) features. Whereas analog
quantities can erode, digital quantities can be stored, refreshed, and
maintained with complete accuracy.

e Duty Cycle: Human brains grow tired with effort. They need time off to take
nourishment and to sleep. They carry the burden of aging. Most profoundly:
They die.

e Modularity (open architecture): Because artificial information processors can
support precisely defined digital interfaces, they can readily assimilate new
modules. Thus, if we want a computer to “see” ultraviolet or infrared or
“hear” ultrasound, we can feed the output from an appropriate sensor directly
into its “nervous system.” The architecture of brains is much more closed and
opaque, and the human immune system actively resists implants.

e Quantum readiness: One case of modularity deserves special mention,
because of its long-term potential. Recently physicists and information
scientists have come to appreciate that the principles of quantum mechanics
support new computing principles, which can empower qualitatively new
forms of information processing and (plausibly) new levels of intelligence.
But these possibilities rely on aspects of quantum behavior which are quite
delicate and seem especially unsuitable for interfacing with the warm, wet,
messy enviroment of human brains.

Evidently, as platforms for intelligence, human brains are far from optimal. Still,
although versatile housekeeping robots or mechanical soldiers would find ready, lucrative
markets, at present there is no machine that approaches the kind of general-purpose
human intelligence those applications would require. Despite their relative weakness on
many fronts, human brains have some big advantages over their artificial competitors.
Let me mention five:

e Three-dimensionality: Although, as noted, the linear dimensions of existing
artificial processing units are vastly smaller than those of brains, the procedure by
which they’re made—centered on lithography (basically, etching)—is essentially
two-dimensional. That is revealed visibly in the geometry of computer boards
and chips. Of course, one can stack boards, but the spacing between layers is
much larger, and communication much less efficient, than within layers. Brains
make better use of all three dimensions.

e Self-repair: Human brains can recover from, or work around, many kinds of
injuries or errors. Computers often must be repaired or rebooted externally.

of an index of expansion and the dimension of the support such that an increase in
expansiveness , 4(+), is compensated by a decrease in Do leaving hr invariant

(Manning,1981). This relationship has also been found in the behavior of some
nonuniformly expansive neuroendocrine, neuronal and human behavioral systems
(Mandell and Selz, 1995; Smotherman et al, 1996; Mandell and Selz, 1997a;).

Is Randomness Versus Determinism a Productive Question for the Biological

Sciences? Are There Better Ones?

Measures made on realistically nonuniformly expansive behavior of
dynamical systems emerging from nonlinear differential equations and that arising
from a variety of non-classical random walk models overlap such that making what
may be more a metaphysical discrimination at this point is labor intensive,
contentious and unproductive for generating new experimental work in the
neurosciences. It is important to note that random walk theory and computation has
matured to such an extent that almost any “nonlinear dynamical behavior” can, with
respect to statistical measure, be modeled using one of many varieties. For
examples, power law distributions in continuous time random walks (times of
movement are also randomly chosen) , random walks with traps (temporarily
immobilizing the trajectory like unstable fixed points), random walks in random
environments, time of passage of ants in a labyrinth and Levy leaps and local
diffusive exploration (looking for a wallet) among many others can represent much
of the irregular behavior we observe in the brain (Shlesinger et al, 1982; Montroll
and Shlesinger, 1984; Hughes, 1995; Klafter et al, 1996). On the other hand,
(Markoff) partition of the sequence and a probabilistic style of analysis of nonlinear
dynamical systems has been a major strategy for description and quantification
from the field’s beginnings (Parry, 1964; Adler and Weiss, 1967; Bowen, 1970;
Lasota and Yorke, 1973). The issue of randomness versus determinism remains

current although many if not most properties of deterministic dynamical systems can

(On August 20, 2015, USIS agreed to forfeit $30 million in fees to
settle the lawsuit.)

USIS was also open to sophisticated hacking attacks by outsid-
ers. In August 2014, the Department of Homeland Security’s coun-
terintelligence unit discovered such a massive and persistent breach
in USIS that it shut down its entire exchange of data with it. The
intrusion into USIS records in this case was attributed to hackers in
China most likely linked to the Chinese intelligence service. Such
massive intrusions dated back to 2011. USIS’s lack of security in its
website left a gaping hole through which outside parties, including
Chinese and Russian hackers, could learn both the identity and the
background information of specialists applying for jobs at the NSA.

These private companies also did not sufficiently protect the per-
sonal data of their independent contractors working at the NSA.
The hackers’ group Anonymous took credit for the successful 2011
attack on the Booz Allen Hamilton servers. It also cracked the algo-
rithms used to protect employees. It next injected so-called Trojan

© horse viruses and other malicious codes into Booz Allen servers ©
that allowed it future entry. If amateur hackers such as Anonymous
could break into the computers of the NSA’s largest contractor, so
could adversaries’ state espionage services with far more advanced
hacking tools. From these sites, China or Russia could obtain all the
job applications and personal résumés submitted to contractors such
as Booz Allen. It could then compile a list of the best candidates to
do its bidding.

These deficiencies in the private sector were compounded by
the failure of security in the government’s own Office of Person-
nel Management. It used a computer system called e-QIP in which
intelligence employees, including outside contractors, updated their
computerized records to maintain or upgrade their security clear-
ances. For example, Snowden updated his clearance in 2011. To do
so, these employees constantly updated their financial and personal
information. As it turned out, there was a major hole in the e-QIP
system. It has repeatedly been hacked by unknown parties since
2010. In 2015, the U.S. government told Congress that China was
most likely responsible, but Russia and other nations with sophis-

KILLING YOUR BLACKBERRY

I’m a 37-year-old Subway franchisee owning and operating 13 stores. Been doing this for seven years.
Prior to reading 4HWW I was KING at W4W (translate: work for work’s sake)! I'd never given myself
“permission” to behave differently than I did as an employee in the past. 4HWW was absolutely
liberating for me. I literally “caught myself’ and began the process of curing my addiction to W4W. I
used to always be “on” and I was never really “present” anywhere—too busy doing the “blackberry
prayer” at the dinner table instead of spending quality time with those who were present. Holidays were
just a remote office for battling the e-mail tsunami. 4HWW gave me a new paradigm and I began to
look at my business as a “product,” the (original) purpose of which was to provide me witha
disproportionate amount of income vs. time invested personally by me—to what end? To ENJOY
MYSELF and to have complete autonomy over my schedule and activities. So I got off my own back,
told myself it was OK to pursue the original purpose and here’s what I did:

Crunched my “always open” workweek into four days and 20 hours. I immediately began taking
Mondays OFF, giving me a nice three-day weekend. (Fridays are in the “CROSSHAIRS” next!) Tuesday
to Friday I work 11 A.M.-4 p.m. (20 hours per week). With the “unluxury” of time in this crunched
workweek I was forced to appraise everything through the 80/20 filter and found that 50% of the 80%
was pure crap and the other 50% of the 80% could be done by someone on my payroll. Great!

Everything I do now has to somehow either increase sales or decrease costs otherwise “it’s someone
else’s job.” You can’t be “half-pregnant,” so when I’m “on” [I’m really on and when I’m “off” ?'m off—
good luck trying to contact me. I still carry portable e-mail but I’ve killed “auto-sync” (the bane of
modern mankind in terms of interruption) now it’s on a Tues-Fri, 11 A.M.-4 p.m. schedule. Outside of
that window it waits.

My e-mail autoresponder eliminated 50% of my e-mail within two weeks as people sending me
meaningless crap got fed up looking at my autoresponder and stopped including me—love it! I keep a
short, compact “to-do” list and anything time-bound is in my calendar. These get my attention before
any other “inbox” does because I’ve previously decided what’s important for me to get done—the rest
can wait.

I could go on, but all in all I think this is a message that the self-employed need to hear so badly. With
no “boss” and no “clean edges” to work-life/home-life it’s so easy to fall into a W4W grind and your
business becomes a tractor beam that trails you inexorably down that path. 4HWW is the antidote!” —
ANDREW, self-employed in the UK

STAR WARS , ANYONE?

I knew my quest for the 4-Hour Workweek was working when my daughter’s kindergarten teacher
asked her the question: “What kind of work does your father do?” As the teacher re-told the story back
to me, it was my daughter’s answer that really struck a chord. “Your daughter turned and looked up at
me with the most serious look on her face and said, ‘My dad just sits around and watches Star Wars all
day.’”

It’s funny how this one simple question, and not to mention my daughter’s answer, would be the
moment of true 4HWW self-awareness for me. You see the answer my daughter gave her teacher has a
deeper meaning. I believe what she meant to say, if she could articulate it, was “My dad sort of does
whatever he wants to do.”

I read the 4HWW almost two years ago when I was on vacation at the beach with my family. I
remember it well, because I kept reading parts of the book to my wife, bothering her to no end. ama

Subject: My review today in wsj of conspiracy theories 
Importance: High 
They're Not Really Out to Get You 
By EDWARD JAY EPSTEIN 
Dec. 18, 2015, Wall Street Journal 
1 
Conspiracy, a word derived from the Latin to breathe together, has been a salient part of the darker 
side of recorded history ever since some 60 conspirators in the Roman senate, including Brutus and 
Cassius, plotted together to assassinate Julius Caesar in 44 B.C. Nowadays the C word does not always 
sit well with journalists, who commonly employ it in conjunction with theory to describe paranoid 
distortions of reality. 
Even so, a criminal conspiracy is not a rare phenomenon. Not only was a foreign conspiracy responsible 
for the monstrous 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center (as well as the previous attempt to blow it up in 
1993) but, according to the Center on Law and Security at Fordham University, over 90% of routine federal 
indictments for terrorist attacks since 9/11 contain at least one conspiracy charge. The government's 
pursuit of conspiracies is by no means limited to terrorism. Conspiracy charges are the rule rather than 
the exception in cases brought against businessmen accused of fixing prices, evading environmental 
regulations, using insider information or laundering money. 
But there are also pseudo-conspiracies that exist only in a delusionary or misinformed mind. And some of 
them achieve a huge following. In Pakistan, according to public opinion polls, a majority of the 
population believes that the 9/11 attack was staged by President George W. Bush to launch a war on Islam. 
The claim that the 1969 moon landing was faked is still around. Just two days ago a crew from a Russian 
TV channel rushed to my apartment to interview me about a viral post on YouTube in which the deceased 
director Stanley Kubrick supposedly made a deathbed confession to having filmed the landing in a 
Hollywood studio—even though everything about the post, including a fake Kubrick, was untrue. 
Why people believe in pseudo-conspiracies is the focus of Rob Brotherton's fascinating book Suspicious 
Minds. Mr. Brotherton, an academic psychologist, advances the thesis that the belief in pseudo-
conspiracies proceeds from the quirks and foibles in the way that the human brain, or at least some 
human brains, process evidence. He lucidly reviews studies showing common defects in the brain's wiring, 
such as the bias that selects evidence to confirm rather than undermine a pre-adopted thesis. We seek 
what we expect to find, as Mr. Brotherton puts it. Relatedly, biased assimilation causes us to 
interpret ambiguous events in light of what we already believe. 
Discussing Richard Hofstadter's 1964 essay The Paranoid Style in American Politics, Mr. Brotherton 
accepts Hofstadter's characterization of proponents of politically motivated conspiracy theories as 
paranoid and suffering from a psychic phenomenon that prevents them from seeing the absurdity of 
their position. But he disagrees with Hofstadter that this condition affects only a small number of 
people on the fringes of society. For Mr. Brotherton, conspiracy theories thrive in the mainstream. 
Until the controversy over the validity of Warren Commission's 1966 report on the Kennedy assassination, 
the phrase conspiracy theory had a more neutral meaning, suggesting a plausible yet unproven claim 
about multiple actors in a single event. Only in the aftermath of the Warren Commission did it become a 
derogatory term used to suggest theories that subvert conventional wisdom. To those who doubted the 
commission's finding that a single gunman killed Kennedy, Earl Warren became, Mr. Brotherton's says, the 
figurehead in a vast cover-up. 
It is not easy to find an objective criterion that distinguishes the inquiry into a real conspiracy from 
one that chases a pseudo-conspiracy. Both types rely are the eyewitnesses, documents and forensic 
evidence. The best that Mr. Brotherton can offer on this score is to cite Stewart Potter's famous comment 
on pornography: I know it when I see it. In the context of suspicious minds, though, one person might 
see a plausible case for a conspiracy and another only outlandish connections. The distinction is in the 
mind of the beholder. 
Mr. Brotherton offers a sample list of conspiracy theories, including ones alleging that Abraham Lincoln 
was assassinated on the orders of his vice president; that the moon landing was faked; that Area 51 in 
New Mexico is home to extra-terrestrial technology under government auspices; that President Obama is a 
communist Muslim from Kenya. Such theories are meant to show that suspicious minds leap to absurd 
conclusions. These are chosen because there is no evidence to support them. 
The picture changes, however, if we consider, for example, the theory claiming that Lincoln's assassin, 
John Wilkes Booth was part of a larger conspiracy backed by the Confederacy. On April 14, 1865, at about 
the same time that Booth shot Lincoln, one of his associates stabbed Secretary of State William Seward 
and another stalked Vice President Andrew Johnson with a loaded gun. The military commission appointed by 
President Johnson, after hearing 371 witnesses testify and after examining Confederate bank transfers and 
cipher communications, concluded that the three attacks were part of a conspiracy sponsored by the 
Confederacy and convicted eight of Booth's associates, four of whom were hanged. Here we have a 
conspiracy theory proceeding not from crackpots but from a government commission backed by the new 
president and most members of Lincoln's cabinet. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 031460 
Clearly the defects in the brain's wiring that lead to crazy theories may lead to the confirmation of 
theories that are adopted by rational people. Indeed, the confirmation bias can work in contradictory 
ways: confirming not only conspiracy theories but the impulse to reject them in favor of conventional 
wisdom. Can this defect be corrected? Here I am reminded of a woody Allen's absolutely brilliant 1996 
comedy Everyone says 1 Love You, in which the once-liberal son of a New York liberal family starts 
spouting conservative theories until a doctor solves the problem by restoring the proper flow of oxygen 
to his brain. The movie has a happy ending when the son goes back to spouting his family's liberal 
theories. While Mr. Brotherton offers no such remedy to our brain's defects, he does offer a thought-
provoking analysis and an appealing guide to thinking about conspiracies, real and imagined. 
—Mr. Epstein most recent book is The Annals of unsolved crimes. He is currently writing a book about 
Edward Snowden.

We are pushing up the highest authority domains available for Jeffrey Epstein in general. I had reserved the 
approach of pushing non-website URLs for a few months because you expressed concern with making sure 
our URLs are on first page... but I had call w/ Mr. Epstein in the beginning of January and expressed that is a 
limiting factor for moving Forbes/NYPost as quickly as we'd like. 
Getting up different types of results for different folks is required to dislodge the negative placements. Once 
they are dislodged it is much easier to restore our websites back to the rankings and have our ideal first 
page. The reason for this is Google tracks click data on results and as soon as Forbes/NYPost are on second 
page they will begin a slow death (less clicks on those, more clicks on the ones we have on first page) 
From there we will see our properties shoot up due to the interlinking between them and the reinforcement we 
can provide from sites like Harvard, Nat Geo, and any other publications we have influence over. Using the 
short-term links is one battle around other pages is just a part of the overall war... You saw how Google was 
changing up much more dramatically when we had multiple Epstein's on the first page vs. having a saturated 
first page.

I feel like time was lost focusing on making sure it was Mr. Epstein properties when he has giving explicit 
permission to promote any URL required to dislodge the negatives. 
I hope this makes sense.. I haven't heard from Rich on the last invoice I sent (1/29/14) and am hoping all is 
well. Do you know if he's out of the office ?

A violent form of fundamentalist Islam could, over time, erode existing Arab
and Muslim states, threatening Israel of course, but also the stability of our
neighbourhood and of the world. In those circumstances, even if an Israeli
government was strong enough, wise enough, forward-looking enough to
pursue avenues for negotiated peace with its immediate neighbours, getting the
popular support required would be all but impossible.

The window 1s still there. But it is only barely open.

I fear that I was right, as well, in predicting that our failure to secure a final
peace agreement with the Palestinians at Camp David might set back
peacemaking not just for a few months, but for many years. I have persisted in
trying, very hard, to make that particular prediction prove wrong. That was why,
despite intense pressure from my own political allies not to do so, I decided to
return to government in 2007 as Defence Minister. I remained in that role for
six years: mostly in the current, right-wing Likud government of my onetime
Sayeret Matkal charge, Bibi Netanyahu.

Much of what I say in this book about war and peace, security and Israel’s
future challenges, will make uncomfortable reading for Bibi. But very little of it
will surprise him, or his own Likud rivals further to the right, like Foreign
Minister Avigdor Lieberman and the Economy Minister, Naftali Bennett. I have
said almost all of it to them behind closed doors in the past few years, more than
once. When I finally decided to leave the political arena last year, it was largely
because I realized that they were guided by other imperatives. In the case of
Bibi, the most gifted politician with whom I’ve worked except for Clinton, the
priority was to stay in power. For Avigdor and Naftali, it was to supplant Bibi,
when the opportunity was ripe, as Likud leader and as Prime Minister. And
much too often — as with their hugely ill-advised recent proposal to amend
Israel’s basic law to define it explicitly as a Jewish state, and deny “national
rights” to non-Jews — the three of them have ended up competing for party
political points rather than weighing the serious future implications for the
country.

Peacemaking, as I discovered first-hand, requires taking risks. Statesmanship
requires risks. Politics, especially if defined simply as staying in power, is
almost always about the avoidance of risk.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030099.txt,"A federal jury decided Thursday that one of the Middle East’s most prominent banks did not commit fraud and
steal technology from an Irvine firm that sued it for half a billion dollars in damages after their partnership
collapsed.

Orange County company InfoSpan had alleged that Emirates NBD ended a partnership for a mobile payment
system because it didn’t want to share revenue and stole InfoSpan’s technology to launch its own service.

The Dubai-based bank, in turn, denied it stole or ever used InfoSpan’s technology. It argued that it cancelled the
partnership because InfoSpan couldn’t produce a working product and misled it into thinking it was an
established company, not one with little to no track record.

After deliberating for a day, the jury unanimously decided that InfoSpan did not prove its case of fraud and theft
of trade secrets.

InfoSpan had asked for $540 million in damages. An attorney for InfoSpan declined to comment on the
possibility of an appeal.

The verdict capped a two-week trial that involved dueling accusations of fraud levied by high-profile attorneys
on both sides, including the former White House counsel to President Obama.

At the center of the high-stakes battle was San Juan Capistrano resident and entrepreneur Farooq Bajwa and a
mobile payment system that he said would allow migrant workers in the Middle East to send remittances back
home through text messages.

Bajwa contended that InfoSpan, with support from outside investors, spent $87 million developing the business
and technology.

To launch the system, known as SpanCash, Bajwa partnered in 2007 with Emirates Bank, which is controlled
by the United Arab Emirates’ sovereign wealth fund.

It seemed the ideal collaboration for the Pakistani immigrant, who earned millions operating another Irvine
company that manufactured computer components in the 1980s and 1990s

The Gulf States rely heavily on migrants to work construction and other low-wage jobs, offering a ready-made
market for SpanCash. InfoSpan aimed to allow migrants to transfer money back home far more cheaply than
Western Union or hawala, a traditional Middle Eastern broker-to-broker money transfer system.

A study from McKinsey & Co., cited in court records, projected annual revenue of $3.5 billion by the deal’s
fifth year, with InfoSpan receiving more than $2.8 billion in fees.

But the relationship between InfoSpan and Emirates Bank soured and the bank cancelled the deal in 2009.

A few days later, Emirates filed a criminal complaint in Dubai against Bajwa and a partner alleging that they
defrauded the bank and misrepresented InfoSpan as an established business with a working technology.

Two years later, InfoSpan sued in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana and alleged that its technology was working
and that it delivered its source code to the bank on servers. Emirates ended the deal, InfoSpan said, to launch its
own mobile payment system after stealing InfoSpan’s technology.

In court, an attorney for InfoSpan argued that Emirates torpedoed the InfoSpan relationship because it abhorred
how much money it would have to share with the Irvine firm.

“They wanted SpanCash and they wanted the money,” attorney William A. Isaacson said in his closing
arguments Wednesday.

Isaacson — a partner with powerhouse law firm Boies Schiller & Flexner, chaired by high-profile litigator David
Boies — argued that the bank resorted to “pure extortion” in an attempt to get its way.

As a result of the bank’s criminal complaint, InfoSpan alleged Bajwa’s partner, Larry Scudder, was detained at
the Dubai International Airport and taken to a cell where he was locked in with 30 other men for 19 hours until
he secured his release by turning over his passport.

According to the lawsuit, Bajwa tried to resolve the situation but was told Scudder's passport would be released
and he could leave the country only if InfoSpan gave up ownership and control of SpanCash to the bank.

Six months later, the bank withdrew the fraud accusations and Scudder got his passport back, but SpanCash’s
reputation was tarnished and it collapsed, Bajwa previously told The Times.

The bank disputed that it acquired InfoSpan’s source code or used it at any time.

Former White House counsel and an attorney for the bank, Kathryn Ruemmler, said that Emirates never would
have acquired source code in a joint-partnership deal like the one reached with InfoSpan. She said such
technology would instead be held by a third-party escrow company for the length of the partnership.

In her closing arguments, the partner with global firm Latham & Watkins told the jury that Bajwa and InfoSpan

depression.)

This is not to question the need for national accounts. We could not manage without
them. But the genius of accountancy is in its reporting of cash flow items.
Depreciation, even its sophisticated form used in national accounts, is a makeshift
approximation better than nothing. I argue that it is obsoleted by our access to

market-valued capital appearing in the last few decades.

Mill’s argument was that capital growth might be explained by productivity gain as
well as by thrift in deferred consumption. The way to test between them that I will
describe takes measurements of market-valued capital, its year-to-year change in
these, and consumption at the same time. I call it the simultaneous rates method. In
any year and country where consumption restraint explains growth, although the
data show none, rise in growth rate would equal current drop in consumption rate
(consumption/capital) while rate of return (output/capital) holds unchanged. When
productivity gain is the explanation, as the data confirm so far, it is consumption
rate that holds the same while growth rate and return rise equally. That’s what I
test. Data in charts and tables for those four nations from 1870 through 2010, and
from Australia, Canada, Italy and Japan from 1970 through 2010, show that faster
capital growth coincides with higher consumption rates in the same year as often as
not. Less consumption has simply meant less output with no growth to show for it.

That is the sense in which growth is free.

These countries and periods are not cherry-picked to support Mill’s idea. They are
all | have found. My source for national accounts including market-valued capital
was the website of Thomas Piketty and Gabriel Zucman adjusting their data to
uniform accounting standards and measuring them in 2010 currency units. It also
collects recent and past research by other economists modeling what national
accounts, again including accounts of market-valued capital, would have shown in

years before they were founded in 1930 or so. Simon Kuznets, for example, who

people, even those you disagree with or despise. The membership roles of both “clubs” are,
tragically, quite small under this criteria, though many claim their honorific mantles.

Being a member of the “Human Rights Club” does not require abstaining from advocacy for one’s
own group (however defined). But it does require more universal advocacy as well. The “motto”
for the club might well be the famous dictum of Hillel: “If I am not for myself, who will be for
me, but if I am for myself alone, what am I? And if not now, when?” I have tried hard to live by
these words—which hang on the wall in my office—and to maintain my membership in the
Human Rights Club, although my priorities have changed with shifting threats to particular groups
over time.

As a young lawyer, I witnessed little threat to the Jewish community in America, despite lingering
anti-Semitism in law firms, social clubs, and some universities and neighborhoods. I fought
against these remnants of bigotry, but it was clear that the trend was in the right direction: top-
down anti-Semitism and elite discrimination against Jews were on the way out. Jews did not need
my help.

By this time, I had stopped being a strictly observant Orthodox Jew. My synagogue attendees
had become episodic and my involvement in the Jewish community peripheral. The reason was
my children. Many people became more religiously committed “because of the children.” For
me, it was the opposite. As my children got old enough to ask questions, I realized that I had
remained observant only to please my parents. I did not want to impose that obligation on my
children. I remained deeply Jewish in a secular sense—whatever that may mean—and my
children were Bat and Bar Mitzvahed and attended Jewish Sunday School, but my life no longer
centered around my identity as a Jew. Nor did my legal career.

Early in my legal career, my first wife, who was also an Orthodox Jew, and I were divorced. I
assumed primary responsibility for the raising of our two sons. A decade after the divorce I met
and soon married Carolyn, who was raised as a sometime Reform and sometime Conservative
Jew in Charleston, South Carolina. Together we live a life dedicated to more secular Jewish
values. I dedicated my first book about my brand of Judaism—Chutzpah—to Carolyn. Carolyn’s
family participated in the struggle for civil rights in Charleston, and we are both deeply committed
to universal human rights.

In the early phase of my career, I didn’t focus on Jewish rights or on Israel. There were bigger
and more serious problems facing America, particularly with regard to race. There were also
more serious problems around the world: Apartheid in South Africa; repression in the Soviet
Union, China, South America and Saudi Arabia; an unjust war being fought by my own country in
Vietnam. I threw myself into these causes (as well as into the worldwide campaign to abolish the
death penalty).

Obama will have to make some decisions. But it’s far better to let the
Syrians do this themselves, if they can. We cannot prevent every
casualty. That’s starting to sound like a doctrine to me. Call it the
doctrine of no doctrine: using our power and influence but doing so
prudently and multilaterally, with the crucial recognition that Egypt is
different from Libya is different from Syria is different from
someplace else. According to the foreign-policy establishment, if you
want to have a self-respecting big-D doctrine, you’re not supposed to
recognize differences. The doctrine must guide all cases. But that is
exactly the kind of thinking that has led—always—to tragedy. The
Truman Doctrine was never meant to be applied to Vietnam. The
Bush Doctrine was applied to Iraq based on a series of lies told to the
American people. And so on. If the Obama Doctrine is nothing like
those, so much the better. This does not yet greatness make. These
dramatic changes have to work out for the better, and here the United
States has a huge role to play. With respect to Libya, for example, we
have control of about $37 billion in assets we can dole out to the
transitional council. And yes, we probably are interested in its oil.
But that doesn’t have to mean stealing it. All the Western countries
that backed the rebels have to play a constructive and non- (forgive
me for such a dated word) imperialist role in helping the country
build its future. So there’s work to be done. But it’s hardly
impossible to envision an Obama administration in a few years’ time
that has drawn down Afghanistan and Iraq, helped foster reforms and
maybe even the growth of a couple of democracies around the Middle
East, and restored the standing of a country that Bush had laid such
staggering waste. And killed Osama bin Laden. If this is weak
America-hating, count me in.

Mr. John Roth

federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein would not be “improper or inappropriate” absent any review at all
of the misconduct here, and absent a full review of the facts and law. The facts, the law, and the
alleged misconduct are each necessarily inextricably intertwined with the question of whether or not
this is a viable federal prosecution. These imposed limits flawed the review from the outset. In any
event, CEOS concedes that the defense team makes “many compelling arguments.” (CEOS letter at
p. 5). Inthe end, then, one is left with the impression that the CEOS review and opinion, although
concluding that the USAO could push forward at its own discretion, is a much qualified one.

The federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein has been a moving target from the inception, Each
time the allegations, the witnesses or the applicable law is subject to a searching inquiry, we have
found that the allegations have been misrepresented, the law does not apply to the actual facts here,
and the USAO prosecution theory falls apart. Yet, in the face of the voluminous evidence we have
submitted in this regard, while acknowledging that the theories are “novel,” and that our arguments
against federal prosecution are “compelling,” CEOS concluded, “Mr. Acosta could rightfully
conclude that this federal issue is best resolved by ajury” and that “the USAO has a good faith basis
to fully develop the facts on this issue and brief the law to permit a court to decide whether the law
appropriately reaches such conduct.” With all due respect, and recognizing that CEOS may be—and
apparently was — limited in its authority, it should not be the prerogative of the prosecution arm of
the United States government to simply roll the dice, and let the court system just sort it out when
dealing with the life and liberty of a United States citizen. The Department of Justice should not be
so cavalier when labeling someone as a child molester. While it may be within the discretion of the
USAO to do so, it is not in accord with the principles of justice.

Indeed, as noted, just a few weeks ago, the Supreme Court underscored this point in Santos
and Cuellar. The Court made clear that prosecutorial discretion does not provide the USAO cart
blanche to expand criminal statutes as they seek to do here with complete disregard for congressional
intent. The Court rejected speculation as a basis of determining the scope of a criminal statute;
“probability is not a guide which a court, in construing a penal statute, can safely take.” Slip op. at 7,
quoting United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76,105 (1820). “We interpret ambiguous criminal
statutes in favor of defendants, not prosecutors.” Slip op. at 12.

Based on my experience, I believe that the facts here do not warrant a federal child
exploitation prosecution. At its core, this case is quintessentially a state concern as opposed to
implicating any federal interest. Indeed, the Florida State Attorney’s Office (“SAO”), led by the
chief of the Sex Crimes Division, thoroughly investigated this matter, and presented it to the grand
jury. The facts, as opposed to the deeply flawed press reports, were carefully assessed by
experienced State prosecutors who aggressively enforce State criminal laws. Following an extensive
15-month State investigation, Mr. Epstein was indicted by a State grand jury ona single felony count
of solicitation of prostitution.

During the investigation, the State prosecutor exhaustively reviewed the evidence, met face-
to-face with many of the alleged victims, considered their credibility — or lack thereof — and

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015016.txt,"You both are interesting; you let us see what's to become of the Scalia 35 (see below; at bottom,
Ghislaine Maxwell's Jeffrey Epstein in context.)

*

We start from this following precept: (the repeating 9/11s)

1. Toward a New World Order speech by Pres. George H.W. Bush — 9/11 (1990)
2. WTC Attack — 9/11 (2001)

3. BENGHAZ1 Attack — 9/11 (2012)

But you have to remember that H. W. Bush was planted:

AUTHOR PETER DALE SCOTT: Sometimes you have little deep events that most people don't even
notice. One of those would be the Halloween Massacre. The older people remember the Saturday
Night Massacre which happened under Nixon. I'm talking about the Halloween Massacre of October
31, 1975, and probably people watching this show have never heard of it.

That was under Ford, and Ford may have condoned it because it was trying to help restore his
popularity. He was going way down in the polls. But it was a very important series of events all on
the same night. The head of the CIA was fired, William Colby, replaced by a relatively unknown man
called George H. W. Bush who then went on to authorize something that Colby had refused to
authorize - the Team B report - the Team B to recalculate the Soviet threat and it was pre-
determined. They were going to find that it was much bigger than the professionals angled like
Raymond [inaudible] that | mentioned.

They said Russia is less of a threat now than it used to be. Well, that was terrible news for the
industrial complex so the Team B came in and said oh, no, no, no, it's much more of a threat than it
used to be, and that’s why we got this huge military build-up. It started actually under Carter but we
think of it as the Reagan build-up, and that of course is a major factor in having ended the Soviet
Union because the Soviet Union tried to match it with a weaker economy. And that arms race which
was not about threats but was about fighting economic war, that was an arms race which you could
say that the Soviet Union lost because they couldn't keep it up. Their economy went more and more
downhill because they were deflecting resources away from vital domestic functions. But really I'm
trying to talk here about the Halloween Massacre...

Just the change in the CIA was a major historical event but it wasn't very visible. The second thing
that happened was they fired Jim Schlesinger as Secretary of Defense... It was being done by
[President Ford's] Chief of Staff and his assistant who are two names barely known then but quite
famous since. Chief of staff was Donald Rumsfeld and the assistant was Dick Cheney. And that was
the first real intrusion of the Rumsfeld-Cheney team into American politics. And they became the real
heart of what | consider the Deep State in the 1980s when they were planning for Continuity of
Government which was a plan for emergency rules like warrantless surveillance and warrantless
detention and the militarization of homeland security. All those things were planned all through the
‘80s - COG planning by Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney. Even when Rumsfeld wasn't in the
government, he was authorized by Reagan to do this planning.

And why is that important to our history? Because in 2001, these two men were now in the
government - Vice President and Secretary of Defense - the two top people in Washington on

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026708.txt,"International real estate focused on key markets
with potential for long-term investment
International real estate allocations also grew in
the period to 2016, though at a lower rate than
home market. Sovereigns reported that increased
international allocations in many cases represented
tactical factors such as restrictions in domestic
market or challenges achieving target allocations in
infrastructure or private equity.

As aresult, increases in international allocations
were relatively concentrated in terms of asset quality
(tier-1 assets offering a comparable return profile
of private equity and infrastructure). This has led
sovereigns to expect greater growth in high grade
office and commercial real estate (figure 20), with
long-term tenancies underpinning income generation,
over industrial or residential categories which offer
asset growth and development potential.

The importance of quality to international real
estate allocations is also evident in geographic
allocations. Sovereigns prefer ‘safe haven’ markets
such as North America and Western Europe when
investing in overseas real estate, with developed
markets leading sovereign citations for preferred real
estate locations shown in figure 21.

Sovereigns acknowledged the benefits

of external asset managers, particularly

for international allocations

The success of domestic real estate investments in

matching liabilities and the scope to capture liquidity

alpha through internal models is reflected in the pace

of home market allocations over the past three years.

However, looking forward sovereigns appreciate

that further increases may be constrained by asset

allocation or the maturity and depth of the local

market. Many sovereigns also noted that there were

risks associated with further internal investment in

home market real estate:

- Despite a focus on high-quality assets, liquidity
is a challenge for real estate investors and many
sovereigns are approaching limits on the size of
their investments

- Growing internalisation leaves sovereigns without
third-party support in governance and compliance
for their real estate investments

- lf interest rates rise, demand for real estate is
expected to slow, with implications for both asset
pricing and liquidity

However, on the assumption that interest rates

globally remain lower near-term, we expect that

sovereign demand for real estate will grow faster

than sovereigns are willing or able to deploy to

home markets. As a result, we expect that over

the next three years allocations to international

markets will grow, and diversification outside

preferred geographies and classes will accelerate.

Despite success in greenfield investing in their home

market, sovereigns are less able to influence supply

of real estate opportunities overseas, providing an

opportunity for external asset managers to support

sovereigns in sourcing and managing real estate deals.

sovereigns have
access to a wide
range of high-
quality domestic
realestate assets.

Donald Trump And The Decline Of American Character--A Cautionary Tale

‘“‘We don’t want the noise about these drugs to be price,” says Leonard Schleifer, the chief executive and
founder of Regeneron. “We have to make sure that people get access to the drug for a fair price if they’re
insured, for free if they’re not insured, or at a discount if they’re under-insured.”

Praluent’s price is 46% higher than that forecast by Evercore ISI, an investment bank, and it is being approved
for a larger group of patients than many Wall Street analysts expected following a meeting convened by the
FDA to analyze the data on the drug. Some doctors argued its use should be restricted mainly to patients with
FH. But Mark Schoenebaum, Evercore ISI’s pharmaceutical analyst, says that investors were initially
disappointed because they had hoped the FDA would greenlight the drug for an even broader group. Regeneron
shares were down 2.5% in afternoon trading before they were halted pending news.

But doctors may prescribe the drug more widely than the label suggests. A survey of physicians published this
morning by Geoffrey Porges, an biotechnology analyst at investment bank Sanford C. Bernstein, found that they
would use the drug in 30% to 40% of patients who had already had heart attacks. He wrote that 2020 sales of
Praluent could be as high as $4.8 billion.

In the survey, doctors expressed a preference for Praluent. One advantage of Regeneron’s drug is that doctors
will be able to start it at a lower, 75 milligram dose.

Schleifer, who is a medical doctor and, incidentally, a billionaire thanks to his Regeneron stake, says that the
company expects that as many as 8 million people who don’t have their cholesterol well-controlled could be
candidates for Praluent. He emphasized, though, that until larger studies prove the drug prevents heart attacks
and strokes patients should always choose statins first. It will have sales representatives a

Insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers, who help insurers and employers manage drug costs, are
going to do their best to restrict use of Praluent, though. Brennan, the CVS Caremark executive, says that he
expects patients will need to have medical records documenting that they have already taken statins. Those not
taking statins would need a blood test confirming that a statin caused elevations in muscle or liver enzymes, not
just complaints that they were achy. “We’re not trying to replace statins,” says Schliefer, the Regeneron CEO.
Most people who have muscle problems from statins do not have those elevated muscle enzymes, says Nissen,
the Cleveland Clinic cardiologist, who is conducting a clinical trial Amgen and Pfizer, which is also developing
a similar cholesterol drug. He says he has patients who are “desperate” to take a statin but who cannot tolerate
it because of muscle pain but do not have elevated muscle enzymes.

Dehspite significant progress over the last decades, high cholesterol remains a leading concern in the U.S. and
globally, said Olivier Brandicourt, M.D., Chief Executive Officer, Sanofi. Praluent demonstrates the power of
the Sanofi and Regeneron alliance to deliver a first-in-class therapy in the U.S. for patients in need. Sanofi has a
strong cardiovascular heritage and dedication to these patients, and we look forward to working with other
regulatory authorities to make Praluent available to patients worldwide.

We are grateful to the thousands of patients and investigators worldwide who participated in the ODYSSEY
clinical trial program, said Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer,
Regeneron. Praluent represents the culmination of more than a decade of tireless work to translate the genetic-
based discovery of PCSK9 into an innovative medicine that brings meaningful value to patients.”

The approval of Praluent was based on data from the pivotal Phase 3 ODYSSEY program, which showed
consistent, positive results compared to placebo, which included current standard of care therapy (statins). In the
ODYSSEY LONG TERM trial which evaluated Praluent 150 mg every two weeks, Praluent reduced LDL

between the adjusted basis of such property to KUE and its fair market value at the time the property was

larger tax distributions under the Limited Partnership Agreement, than Partners who acquired their
interests in KUE pursuant to this offering.

14.12. Fixed Overhead Payment

KUE, and/or one or more of its subsidiaries will pay $20 million annually ta KULG in quarterly installments
beginning July 1, 2006 pursuant fo the Fixed Overhead Payment Agreement as an agreed upon payment
to provide for the reimbursement of expenses and other costs incurred by KULG on behalf of KUE and its
subsidiaries (including, but not limited to, salaries and bonuses of KULG employees providing services to
KUE and its subsidiaries, fees and expenses relating te financing transactions and acquisitions,
professional fees and other administrative expenses). To the extent that the U.S. $2,500,000 fee payable
pursuant to an existing management services agreement with Knowledge Learning Corporation is paid to
any person or entity other than a subsidiary of KUE, the amount payable to KULG by KUE will be reduced
by the amount of such payment to such other person or entity. The $20 million annual fee will terminate
upon the Initial Listing or the sale of KUE to a person or entity that is not a KUE LLC Entity.

KUE will operate for a period of seven years from the date of the first closing of this offering. If there has
not been an Initial Listing by the end of seven years from the date of the first closing of this offering, the
Board of Directors of the General Partner will determine whether to pursue a sale of KUE or an Initial
Listing (or a dual track process); provided, however, in the event that not less than 75% of the value of
KUE at that time is represented by shares of securities listed on one or more recognized international
securities exchanges and such shares have been or will be distributed as soon as reasonably practicable
thereafter to the Investors and the Investors have received distributions of cash and/or such securities
valued at amounts equal fo or in excess of their original capital contributions, then there will be two
extensions of one year's duration each (as determined by the Board of Directors of the General Partner)
in order for KUE to complete either an Initial Listing or to have the remaining value of KUE represented by
shares of securities listed on a recognized international securities exchange and to distribute such shares
to the Investors.

If the Board determines to pursue a sale of KUE (or an Initial Listing or a dual track process), then the
Principals must determine at such time whether they intend to participate as a potential bidder in the sale
process.

If the Principals elect not to participate as a potential bidder in a sale process, then they will not be
allowed to subsequently elect to participate as a potential bidder unless the sale process does not result
in a buyer at a price the Independent Committee deems to be fair. If the sale process results in a
transaction that the Independent Committee deems to be fair, the Principals will be required to sell their
entire stake in KUE (Common LP Units and Profits Participation LP Units on an as converted basis) on
the same terms as the Investors.

If the Principals elect to participate as a potential bidder in a sale process, then the sale process will be
managed by the Independent Committee and the Principals will be precluded from participating in Board
deliberations regarding the sale process. In addition, the Principals will be required to sell their entire

'Shady' Israeli Mogul Hires Ex-White House Counsel To Represent Employee Arrested in Inauguration Day 
Riot, Raising Questions<http://heatst.com/politics/shady-israeli-mogul-hires-ex-white-house-counsel-to-
represent-employee-arrested-in-inauguration-day-riot-raising-questions/> 
By Heat Street Staffl 6:36 pm, January 23, 2017 
The mystery surrounding a would-be media magnate — who owns surveillance and security firms working for 
repressive regimes — is growing. 
The questions about Matania (Mati) Kochavi were sparked again this weekend when Kathryn Ruemmler, who 
until recently was President Obama's White House Counsel, showed up on Saturday morning in local 
Washington DC court to represent one of the 217 people arrested for rioting on Inauguration Day. 
[http://heatst.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ruemmler-obamajpg?w=300]Kathryn Ruemmler and client. 
Ms. Ruemmler said she was there to represent a journalist, on assignment for the media company 
Vocativ<http://www.vocativ.com/>, who'd gotten swept up with the protesters in the arrests. 
Vocativ is owned by Kochavi. Reporters at the courthouse asked why a big gun like Ruemmler, who has long 
been a specialist in corporate crime, would show up for what would seem to be a misunderstanding involving a 
journalist doing his job. 
Ms. Ruemmler told Buzzfeed that Vocativ is a client of her 
firm,<http s ://www.buzz feed. co m/zo etillman/pro s ecutors-pursue-rioting- charges- over-inauguration- day-
pro?utm term=.gtPej4zonti.cgyzaBvG2> Latham & Watkins. The firm is one of the most prestigious law shops 
in New York and Washington with partners such as Ruemmler<https://www.lw.com/people/kathrynruemmler> 
charging thousands of dollars an hour. 
She did look somewhat out of place among the lawyers there to defend anarchists and other alleged 
troublemakers who are charged with rioting, burning a limo and smashing up stores on the streets of the capital. 
The individuals charged were generally brought in front of the judge in groups of 10 and were represented by a 
cadre of public defenders and other court-appointed lawyers, according to Buzzfeed. That was not the case 
when it came to Vocativ. 
Based in New York and Tel Aviv, Vocativ publishes mostly reprints of health studies, aggregated videos for 
Facebook, and female focused feature pieces. The company which employs a large team of US journalists and 
ex-Israeli intelligence operatives, claims to use technology from the intelligence world to source its stories. 
Indeed its founder, Kochavi, has a background in Israeli intelligence, having made his fortune providing 
security and military grade public safety solutions to the superrich Emirate of Abu Dhabi through an entity 
called AGT. 
[http ://heatst. com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/abu-dhabi-mosque.jp g?w=300] The Grand Mosque of Abu 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026653 
Dhabi 
AGT was responsible for installing a unique civil surveillance network in Abu Dhabi that means 'every person 
is monitored from the moment they leave their doorstep to the moment they return to it,' according to the noted 
security publication MiddleEastEye.<http ://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uae-israel-surveillance-2104952769> 
The invasive system is dubbed Falcon Eye. 
Kochavi also owns Israeli security and private intelligence firms 3iMind and Logic Industries. Like Vocativ, 
3iMind claims to use the deep web to mine information, though in 3iMind's case it provides spy services, not 
journalistic ones. 3iMind even advertises online that it will spy on the planning and execution of violent civil 
unrest for clients.<https://www.3i-mind.com/use cases/political-social-unrest/> 
The website for Kochavi's mother company<https://www.agtinternational.com/about/>, AGT, claims its current 
business is using Internet of Things technology for entertainment and fashion applications in partnership 
with the giant talent agency WME-IMG ... though it's unclear what any of these applications really 
are<http://www.euroleague.net/final-four/berlin-2016/news/i/6vokoibj5fsgqg4q/heed-the-event-platform-based-
joint-venture-between-wme-img-and-agt-international-makes-first-official-foray-into-sports>, and certainly 
what value they provide for entertainment. Security experts say Internet of Things type sensors could be tied 
together to monitor crowds for security purposes. 
According to Israeli and U.S. Jewish publications, the lines within Kochavi's companies can blur, with Vocativ 
employees doing work for 3iMind and Logic, and vice versa. So who was this journalist arrested amid the 
unrest on Inauguration Day? Was he actually doing journalism? Or, as some journalists around town have been 
asking, could he also have been doing surveillance of anti-Trump demonstrators on behalf of an Arab or Israeli 
client, possibly a foreign government?

=300]Kochavi employee Evan Engel (LinkedIn) 
A call to Ruemmler was returned by someone identifying himself as a Vocativ spokesperson. He told Heat 
Street that the arrested employee, Evan Engel, was doing purely journalistic work at the time he was detained. 
The arrest, detainment and rioting charge against journalist Evan Engel who was covering the protests for 
Vocativ are an affront to the First Amendment and journalistic freedom, the spokesperson said. Vocativ will 
vigorously contest this unfounded and outrageous charge. 
Kochavi has taken pains to put a different face, unrelated to spying and surveillance, on his American activities. 
Vocativ acts like a news organization, though it's made little splash (and gets remarkably little web 
traffic<http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/vocativ.com>) for an operation so large and expensive. 
Kochavi has also shown little hesitation to pay top dollar for access to the most powerful figures in America to 
provide legitimacy for his American activities. Last fall's Wikipedia data dump revealed that he and his 
longtime business partner, New York rainmaking lawyer Mary Edelman, offered Bill Clinton millions of dollars 
to serve as honorary chairman of the company that would become Vocativ. <http://heatst.com/biz/wikileaks-
bill-clinton-turned-down-8-million-to-be-honorary-chairman-of-news-site-vocativ/> Clinton turned them down, 
perhaps nervous about Kochavi who's been described as a mysterious even somewhat shady character and the 
Israeli version of the old-fashioned arms dealer with a suit and an MBA by the progressive Jewish blog 
Tikkun Olam.<https://www.richardsilverstein.com/2014/12/04/israeli-cyber-security-merchant-peddles-wares-

officer. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026654 
And now Kochavi has purchased the services of President Obama's former White House counsel, Ruemmler, 
whose name was once on the shortlist<http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-ruemmler-attorney-general-nixed-
20141024-story.html> for US attorney general. It's a fair question to ask: why was Ruemmler really down in 
local DC court on a Saturday morning? Why was getting this Vocativ employee off the hook such a high 
priority? And what, if any, other services has Ruemmler, the corporate crime expert, been providing to Kochavi 
and his various intelligence operations around the world? 
Ruemmler herself has not returned requests for comment.

WASHINGTON — As hundreds of thousands of demonstrators 
gathered<https://www.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeednews/womens-
march?utm term=.wra9MGEmBAgtOrQXPW34> on the National Mall to protest President Trump on 
Saturday, people arrested<https://www.buzzfeed.com/zoetillman/rioters-and-police-are-clash-during-trumps-
inauguration> the day before during anti-Trump protests in downtown Washington, DC, made their first 
appearance in court. 
Prosecutors are pursuing charges against all of the 230 people arrested on Friday for rioting, according to the 
US attorney's office in DC. Although anti-Trump demonstrations on inauguration day were largely peaceful, 
some turned violent, with participants breaking storefront windows, throwing bricks at police, and running 
through streets and parks downtown as they were chased by police. 
The arraignment hearing at DC Superior Court began on Saturday around 1 p.m. and was still going six hours 
later. As of 7 p.m., 80 people arrested and charged with felony rioting had come before a judge. The court was 
expected to continue the hearing through the night until everyone arrested on Friday came through. 
The defendants processed so far were released until their next court dates, with the condition that they not be 
arrested again in DC in the meantime. 
Felony rioting is a crime under DC law that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail and a fine of up to 
$25,000. According to police, six officers were injured in confrontations with demonstrators on Jan. 20, and 
three of those officers sustained minor head injuries after objects were thrown at them. The DC law defines 
felony rioting as a group of at least five people who, by tumultuous and violent conduct and the threat thereof, 
cause serious bodily harm or property damage valued at more than $5,000. 
A 21-year-old Texas man was also charged with pointing a laser at at US Park Police helicopter during the 
protests on Friday. He was arraigned in Superior Court but the case is being moved to federal court. 
The individuals charged with rioting were generally brought in front of the judge in groups of 10 and were 
represented by a cadre of public defenders and other court-appointed lawyers. One exception came early in the 
hearing, when former White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler entered an appearance for one of the 
defendants. Ruemmler said her client was a journalist on assignment filming the demonstrations who was swept 
up in the arrests. 
Ruemmler served as President Obama's White House counsel for three years before going to the law firm 
Latham & Watkins. Ruemmler told reporters outside of the courtroom that her firm represents Vocativ, the 
media company that employed her client, which is how she got involved. 
Dozens of people came to the courthouse on Saturday to support the arrestees. They cheered as defendants left 
the courtroom; some of the defendants were walking slowly to keep their shoes on because they had to remove 
their shoelaces after being arrested. The defendants were held by police overnight.

Zoe Tillman / BuzzFeed News 
By Saturday night, a crowd had gathered outside the courthouse to greet the arrestees, cheering and applauding 
as they came out. A line of police formed in between the group and the courthouse entrance, and police were 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026656 
screening people trying to go inside. 
Several lawyers offered a preview of their defense strategy during the hearing, arguing that the rioting charge 
should be dismissed because prosecutors hadn't shown that each defendant was specifically involved in the 
rioting described in charging documents. Although the defendants were brought out in groups before the judge, 
they're individually charged. 
One lawyer argued that the US attorney's office should recuse from prosecuting the cases because the 
defendants were charged with participating in anti-Trump riots and Trump was now in charge of the US 
Department of Justice. 
I appreciate all the creative arguments, Magistrate Judge Rainey Brandt said in response, but she said that at 
this early stage of the case she only had to find that the government had shown probable cause to move the 
cases forward. 
The defendants are due back in court on various dates in February and March.

The U.S. attorney's office will seek to charge all 230 of the protesters who took to the streets on Inauguration

As of Saturday evening, 80 people had already been slapped with the heavy charges, which include fines of up

Felony rioting is defined in D.C. law by at least five people who use tumultuous and violent conduct of the 
threat thereof' to cause serious bodily harm and instigate more than $5,000 in property damage. 
Six local officers were injured by protesters during Trump's big day. The glass windows of several businesses 
were shattered in downtown D.C. including Bank of America, McDonald's and Starbucks. 
All of the people who have already been charged were released on their own recognizance and given their next 
court appearance dates. 
At least one of those arrested was a Vocativ journalist covering the protests, and he was defended by heavy-
hitter and former White House attorney Kathryn Ruemmler, Buzzfeed reported.

volved. These are very low level processes whose analogues in human experience are largely
below the conscious level.

A Goal is considered as a statement that the system may strive to make true at some future
time. A Motive is an (urge, goal) pair, consisting of a goal whose satisfaction is predicted to
imply the satisfaction of some urge. In fact one may consider Urges as top-level goals, and the
agent’s other goals as their subgoals.

In Psi an agent has one “ruling motive” at any point in time, but this seems an oversimpli-
fication more applicable to simple animals than to human-like or other advanced AI systems.
In general one may think of different motives having different weights indicating the amount of
resources that will be spent on pursuing them.

Emotions in Psi are considered as complex systemic response-patterns rather than explicitly
constructed entities. An emotion is the set of mental entities activated in response to a certain
set of urges. Dorner conceived theories about how various common emotions emerge from the
dynamics of urges and motives as described in the Psi model. “Intentions” are also considered as
composite entities: an intention at a given point in time consists of the active motives, together
with their related goals, behavior programs and so forth.

Foreign Policy

The Syrian Time Bomb

Patrick Seale



March 28, 2011 -- While one war rages in Libya, another rages in Washington as to the necessity of U.S. action there. Indeed, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said as much this weekend, noting that Libya was not a vital national interest. But if Washington is looking for an Arab state in the throes of unrest, one that is key to its regional and national interests, planners might want to pay more attention to Syria, which is currently undergoing upheaval not seen since the early 1980s. Syria lies at the center of a dense network of Middle East relationships, and the crisis in that country -- which has now resulted in the deaths of well over 100 civilians, and possibly close to double that number -- is likely to have a major impact on the regional structure of power. The need to contain pressure from the United States and Israel, for decades the all-consuming concern of Syria's leadership, has suddenly been displaced by an explosion of popular protest highlighting urgent and long-neglected domestic issues. 

If the regime fails to tame this domestic unrest, Syria's external influence will inevitably be enfeebled, with dramatic repercussions across the Middle East. As the crisis deepens, Syria's allies tremble. Meanwhile, its enemies rejoice, as a weakened Syria would remove an obstacle to their ambitions. But nature abhors a vacuum, and what will come will be unpredictable, at best. 

The protests started in mid-March in Daraa, in southern Syria, a city that has suffered from drought and neglect by the government in Damascus. The heavy hand of the ruling Baath party was particularly resented. Because it lies on the border with Jordan, and therefore in a security zone, all land sales required the security services' approval, a slow and often costly business. This is one of the particular grievances that have powered the protest movement, though certainly the ripples of the successful Egyptian and Tunisian uprisings played a hand. The government, to put it bluntly, responded poorly. Troops in Daraa fired live rounds against youthful demonstrators and virtually all communications -- Internet and telephone -- were shuttered to prevent the seepage of unrest. 

To make matters worse, Damascus blamed Israeli provocateurs, rebel forces, and shady foreign agents for the bloodshed -- anyone but its own forces. Civilian deaths at the hands of security forces there, and more recently in the coastal city of Latakia, have outraged opinion across the country, setting alight long pent-up anger at the denial of basic freedoms, the monopolistic rule of the Baath party, and the abuses of a privileged elite. To these ills should be added severe youth unemployment, devastation of the countryside by a grave shortage of rainfall over the past four years, and the impoverishment of the middle and lower classes by low wages and high inflation. 

In response to the public unrest, the regime has released some political prisoners and pledged to end the state of emergency in force since 1963. A government spokeswoman has hinted that coming reforms will include greater freedom for the press and the right to form political parties. President Bashar al-Assad is due to address the country in the next 48 hours. His speech is eagerly awaited, but it remains to be seen whether it will be enough to defuse the crisis and win time for the regime. If not, demonstrations could gather pace, triggering still more violent repression by the security services -- an escalation with unpredictable consequences. 

The protesters have in fact challenged the fundamentals of Syria's security state, a harsh system of controls over every aspect of society, put in place by the late Hafez al-Assad, Bashar's father, who ruled for 30 years from 1970 to his death in 2000. By all accounts, the debate about how to deal with the growing protests has led to increasingly violent confrontations inside the regime between would-be reformers and hard-liners. The outcome of this internal contest remains uncertain. 

What is certain, however, is that what happens in Syria is of great concern to the whole region. Together with its two principal allies, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Lebanese Shiite resistance movement Hezbollah, Syria is viewed with great hostility by Israel and with wary suspicion by the United States. The Tehran-Damascus-Hezbollah axis -- of which Syria is the linchpin -- has long been seen by many leaders in the region as the lone bulwark against Israeli and American hegemony. With backing from Washington, Israel has sought to smash Hezbollah (notably through its 2006 invasion of Lebanon) and detach Syria from Iran, a country Israel views as its most dangerous regional rival. Neither objective has so far been realized. But now that Syria has been weakened by internal problems, the viability of the entire axis is in danger -- which could encourage dangerous risk-taking behavior by its allies as they seek to counter perceived gains by the United States and Israel. 

If the Syrian regime were to be severely weakened by popular dissent, if only for a short while, Iran's influence in Arab affairs would almost certainly be reduced -- in both Lebanon and the Palestinian territories. In Lebanon, it would appear that Hezbollah has already been thrown on the defensive. Although it remains the most powerful single movement, both politically and on account of its armed militia, its local enemies sense a turning of the tide in their favor. This might explain a violent speech delivered earlier this month by the Sunni Muslim leader and former prime minister Saad Hariri, in which he blatantly played the sectarian card. 

Cheered by his jubilant supporters, he charged that Hezbollah's weapons were not so much a threat to Israel as to Lebanon's own freedom, independence, and sovereignty -- at the hand of a foreign power, namely Iran. The Syrian uprisings may have already deepened the sectarian divide in Lebanon, raising once more the specter of civil war and making more difficult the task of forming a new government, a job President Michel Suleiman has entrusted to the Tripoli notable, Najib Mikati. If Syria were overrun with internal strife, Hezbollah would be deprived of a valuable ally -- no doubt to Israel's great satisfaction. 

Meanwhile, Turkey is deeply concerned by the Syrian disturbances: Damascus has been the cornerstone of Ankara's ambitious Arab policy. Turkey-Syria relations have flourished in recent years as Turkey-Israel relations have grown cold. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, have actively sought to mediate local conflicts and bring much-needed stability to the region by forging close economic links. One of their bold projects is the creation of an economic bloc comprising Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan -- already something of a reality by the removal of visa requirements as well as by an injection of Turkish investment and technological know-how. A power struggle in Syria could set back this project; and regime change in Damascus would likely put a serious dent in further Turkish initiatives. 

Turkey's loss, however, may turn out to be Egypt's gain. Freed from the stagnant rule of former President Hosni Mubarak, Cairo is now expected to play a more active role in Arab affairs. Instead of continuing Mubarak's policy, conducted in complicity with Israel, of punishing Gaza and isolating its Hamas government, Egypt is reported to be pushing for a reconciliation of the rival Palestinian factions, Hamas and Fatah. If successful, this could help defuse the current dangerous escalation of violence between Israel on the one side and Hamas and still more extreme Gaza-based Palestinian groups on the other. But Syria's internal troubles might just as easily have a negative effect. 

Undoubtedly, the failed peace process has bred extreme frustration among Palestinian militants, some of whom may think that a sharp shock is needed to wrench international attention away from the Arab democratic wave and back to the Palestine problem. They are anxious to alert the United States and Europe to the danger of allowing the peace process to sink into a prolonged coma. Israeli hard-liners, too, may calculate that a short war could serve their purpose: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right government may sense weakness and quietly dream of finishing off Hamas once and for all. Syria has been a strong supporter of Hamas and has given a base in Damascus to the head of its political bureau, Khaled Mashal. Turmoil in Damascus could deal Hamas a severe blow. 

On all these fronts -- Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel -- Syria is a key player. But its internal problems now threaten to reshuffle the cards, adding to the general sense of insecurity and latent violence in the region. And of all the threats facing the Middle East, perhaps the greatest -- greater even than of another Arab-Israeli clash -- is that of rampant sectarianism, poisoning relationships between and within states, and breeding hate, intolerance, and mistrust.  

Several of the modern states of the Middle East -- and Syria is no exception -- were built on a mosaic of ancient religions, sects, and ethnic groups held uneasily and sometimes uncomfortably together by central government. But governments have themselves been far from neutral, favoring one community over another in cynical power plays. Many Sunni Muslims in Syria and throughout the region feel that Assad's Syria has unduly favored the Alawites, a sect of Shiite Islam, who constitute some 12 percent of the population but control a vastly greater percentage of the country's wealth. Open conflict between Sunnis and Alawites in Syria would profoundly disturb the whole region, creating a nightmare scenario for Washington and other Western capitals. 

Meanwhile, Washington seems at a loss as to how to respond to the growing unrest in Syria. In tempered language, the administration has condemned the use of violence against civilians and encouraged political reform. But the undertones are evident: Stability in Syria may still preferable to yet another experiment in Arab governance. Assad will need to act quickly and decisively -- and one hopes not harshly -- to quell the rising current of dissent. Indeed, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton seemed to offer the regime some modest support this weekend, noting that she believed Bashar to be a reformer. But reform has never been a primary goal of the Assad clan, which has long favored stability over change. 

This edifice may now be crumbling, and the United States would be wise to spend a little less time thinking about Libya and a little more time thinking about a state that truly has implications on U.S. national interests. If things go south in Syria, blood-thirsty sectarian demons risk being unleashed, and the entire region could be consumed in an orgy of violence.

Obama failing as commander in chief
Robert D. Blackwill 


March 28, 2011 -- The Obama administration deserves credit for its foreign policy achievements.

There has been no successful terrorist attack on U.S. soil. President Barack Obama and his colleagues have, thus far, skillfully handled the popular eruptions in Tunisia and Egypt — though those crises are far from over. They strengthened sanctions against Iran regarding its nuclear weapons program; reset U.S.-Russia relations and completed the New START Treaty. They have begun to deal effectively with the rise of Chinese power; continued, after a slow start, the transformation of U.S.-India relations, and signed a bilateral trade accord with South Korea. They also modernized the North Atlantic Treaty Organization with summit agreements on a new strategic concept and ballistic missile defense.

But the administration’s record of failure is equally as long. It has not seriously tackled our deficit and debt problem, the single greatest threat to long-term U.S. power and influence. It is now mishandling relations with the Gulf Arab monarchs and made a mess of the Middle East peace process. It has allowed the U.S.-Turkey relationship to reach historic lows, just as Turkey is becoming a formidable actor in the Greater Middle East.

By concentrating on health care for its first two years, the administration, and the large majorities in Congress, missed a crucial opportunity to pass climate change legislation. With the Democratic party’s internal constituencies, there also has been almost no movement on international trade.

Right now, nobody has a successful formula for helping Pakistan — with its 100-plus nuclear weapons — arrest its systemic decline; or for coercing North Korea to slow its growing nuclear weapons and missile capabilities. So the administration gets the benefit of the doubt on those two perplexing problems.

Obama has, however, failed in the most important presidential power: to act as a wise commander in chief. He is seriously mismanaging all three wars the U.S. is now engaged in.

In Iraq, over the past decade, the United States has lost 4,500 American lives, has had 33,000 wounded and has spent a trillion dollars to promote vital U.S. national interests. But we are in danger of losing that enormous sacrifice in blood and treasure to meet the president’s deadline of withdrawing all U.S. troops by the end of this year.

That is a huge strategic mistake. It could, over time, plunge that pivotal nation back into civil war. We should keep roughly 40,000 combat troops in Iraq for the foreseeable future, to make an indispensable contribution to Iraq’s stability and prevent Iranian dominance. We should now be lobbying the Iraqi government hard to accept this.

In Afghanistan, Obama has dramatically escalated U.S. troop commitment — now more than 100,000 — in a war that Bob Woodward says in his book, “Obama’s Wars,” that the president does not believe in. U.S. policy toward Afghanistan involves spending $100 billion and suffering several hundred allied deaths annually — 500 Americans dead last year, thousands more injured. All this to deal with 100 or so Al Qaeda fighters now in Afghanistan; and prevent the Afghan Taliban from controlling the Pashtun Afghan homeland — which was not the reason we went there after Sept. 11. Our mission was to eradicate Al Qaeda — now largely accomplished — not fight the Taliban.

In policy terms, this has been enormous mission creep far beyond our national interests. The current U.S. counterinsurgency strategy appears likely to fail. Washington and its allies will not defeat the Taliban militarily. President Hamid Karzai’s corrupt government is unlikely to improve significantly. The Afghan National Army cannot take over combat missions from the U.S. in southern and eastern Afghanistan in any realistic time frame. And the Pakistan army will not move against Afghan Taliban sanctuaries in Pakistan.
De facto Afghan partition offers the Obama administration the best alternative to strategic defeat. The administration should stop setting withdrawal deadlines and instead commit the United States to a long-term combat role in Afghanistan, with roughly 35,000 to 50,000 troops, for the next seven to 10 years.
Washington should also accept that the Taliban are likely to control most of the Pashtun south and east. The price of forestalling that is far too high for Americans to continue paying. Washington and its partners should let the local correlation of forces take its course in the Pashtun homeland — while deploying U.S. air power and Special Forces to ensure that the north and west of Afghanistan do not succumb to the Taliban.
In Libya, the president has gotten us militarily into the middle of a civil war in a country of little importance to the United States. And he offers no clear strategy to reach his ambitious objectives. The administration’s inconsistent, even incoherent, statements on the Libya war wrestle each other for dominance in the daily news cycle, while NATO predictably founders without robust U.S. leadership.
The U.S. should quickly end its military role in the Libyan civil war. We should leave that to the European allies — if they want to take it up — and return to issues of far greater importance to our country, like our fiscal problems.

We can only speculate why Obama has such difficulty in effectively using the U.S. military as an instrument of national purpose.
Winston Churchill said, “In critical and baffling situations, it is always best to return to first principle and simple action.”
What is Obama’s first principle regarding the application of the use of force in the international arena? He seems to possess no abiding strategic framework about that preeminent presidential responsibility. He makes no clear connection between the use of force and vital U.S. national interests.
Thus, he recklessly withdraws from Iraq, imprudently escalates in Afghanistan and unwisely intervenes in Libya. One can only wonder and worry what he will do if and when he confronts the next crisis which could involve committing American men and women to combat.

Libya, a last hurrah for the west

Gideon Rachman



March 28 2011 -- The war in Libya is about a lot more than Muammer Gaddafi. Its outcome will reverberate around the Middle East and will affect international politics for decades. A vital principle is at stake.

The supporters of outside intervention believe that they are battling not just to stop atrocities in Libya itself, but to lay down a marker for the future. They want to show that the age when a dictator could massacre his own citizens is coming to a close. Bernard Henri-Lévy, a French philosopher who played an improbable role as a link between the Libyan rebels and President Nicolas Sarkozy, has said: “What is important in this affair is that the ‘duty to intervene’ has been recognised.” 

Nicholas Kristof, writing in The New York Times, makes a similar point – “World powers have the right and obligation to intervene when a dictator devours his people.” This idea was approved by the UN in 2005 and, according to Mr Kristof, the Libyan intervention is “putting teeth into that fledgling concept.”

It would be nice to believe that the doctrine of a “responsibility to protect”, known colloquially as R2P, now has real bite. With rebel troops advancing swiftly along the Libyan coast, the supporters of the intervention will be feeling cheerful.

But the reality is that the Libyan war is more likely to mark a last hurrah for liberal interventionism than a new dawn. For the brutal truth is that the western powers that are the keenest promoters of the idea will not have the economic strength or the public backing to sustain many more overseas interventions. And the rising economic powers – China, India, Brazil and others – are deeply sceptical about the whole concept. Britain, France and the US all voted in favour of the UN resolution authorising force in Libya. But the fashionable grouping known as the Brics – Brazil, Russia, India and China – all abstained. None of them have much time for Colonel Gaddafi. But countries like China, India and Brazil see little to gain, and much to lose, by risking money, men and influence in foreign interventions. Their instinct is to mind their own business and to concentrate on the long-term goal of building up their own economic strength. A massacre in Libya might be unfortunate, no doubt – but Benghazi is a long way from Beijing or Brasília. 

There are some complications. Germany abstained but, in doing so, placed itself outside the western mainstream. South Africa, which has been invited to the next Brics summit, voted for the Libyan resolution, but then criticised the bombing campaign vociferously.

So the broad picture holds. The established western powers still have a missionary zeal to put the world to rights. The rising powers are much more cautious and egocentric. 

But the western allies are fighting against a background of shrinking resources. The British have just announced big defence cuts and the French are also battling to contain their budget deficit and maintain their welfare state. 

The reluctance of the American military establishment to take on this new commitment has also been palpable. President Barack Obama and his generals know that the age when a US president could simply say that America would do “whatever it takes” is over. Admiral Mike Mullen, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, has said that the biggest threat to US national security is the budget deficit. In the post-Iraq, post-Afghanistan era, public support for military operations overseas is also limited. 

Of course, if there is a swift and successful conclusion to the Libyan intervention – Col Gaddafi deposed, cheering crowds in Tripoli – then liberal interventionism will get a boost. But success could be just as much of a snare as failure. Each successful intervention will prompt demand for the next one – and there will be no shortage of possible candidates. Indeed that question is already being raised by the sight of the Syrian government shooting its own citizens. Yet, the more demands that are placed on the western powers, the more it will be evident that there is a growing mismatch between ambition and resources. That gap could, one day, be filled if the Brics and other rising powers change their attitudes to liberal interventionism. But there is very little sign of that happening. The Chinese government, with memories of Tiananmen Square in 1989, is deeply wary of the idea that foreigners have the right to intervene to prevent human rights abuses in a sovereign nation. The same goes for the Russians, with their record in Chechnya. India, Brazil and South Africa are democratic countries with no need for a contingency plan to shoot their own citizens. But their colonial histories incline them to take a sceptical view of the motives of western powers that seek to use military power around the world. They are also all emerging powers that are not yet used to thinking globally.  By contrast, Britain and France have maintained the instinct to think globally, without the resources to back it up. Even the US, by far the world’s pre-eminent military power, is signalling strongly that it is losing the will to be the world’s policeman.   In the Victorian age, the British once sang – “We don’t want to fight, but by Jingo if we do/ We’ve got the ships, we’ve got the men, we’ve got the money too.” The Libyan intervention feels like a last reprise of that old tune, rather than a bold statement for a new age.

President Obama on Libya

Editorial

March 28, 2011 -- President Obama made the right, albeit belated, decision to join with allies and try to stop Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi from slaughtering thousands of Libyans. But he has been far too slow to explain that decision, or his long-term strategy, to Congress and the American people. On Monday night, the president spoke to the nation and made a strong case for why America needed to intervene in this fight — and why that did not always mean it should intervene in others. Mr. Obama said that the United States had a moral responsibility to stop “violence on a horrific scale,” as well as a unique international mandate and a broad coalition to act with. He said that failure to intervene could also have threatened the peaceful transitions in Egypt and Tunisia, as thousands of Libyan refugees poured across their borders, while other dictators would conclude that “violence is the best strategy to cling to power.” Mr. Obama could report encouraging early progress on the military and diplomatic fronts. Washington and its allies have crippled or destroyed Colonel Qaddafi’s anti-aircraft defenses, peeled his troops back from the city of Benghazi — saving potentially thousands of lives — and allowed rebel forces to retake the offensive. Just as encouragingly, this military effort that was galvanized internationally — the United Nations Security Council authorized “all necessary measures” to protect civilians in Libya — will soon be run internationally. Last weekend, the United States handed over responsibility for enforcing the no-flight zone to NATO. And the alliance is now preparing to take command of the entire mission, with the support of (still too few) Arab nations. To his credit, Mr. Obama did not sugarcoat the difficulties ahead. While he suggested that his goal, ultimately, is to see Colonel Qaddafi gone, he also said that the air war was unlikely to accomplish that by itself. Most important, he vowed that there would be no American ground troops in this fight. “If we tried to overthrow Qaddafi by force,” he said, “our coalition would splinter.” He said “regime change” in Iraq took eight years and cost thousands of American and Iraqi lives. “That is not something we can afford to repeat in Libya.” Instead, he said the United States and its allies would work to increase the diplomatic and military pressure on Colonel Qaddafi and his cronies. A meeting on Tuesday with allies and members of the Libyan opposition is supposed to develop that strategy along with ways to help the rebels build alternate, and we hope humane and competent, governing structures. That needs to start quickly. To hold their ground and protect endangered civilians, let alone advance, the rebels will likely need air support for quite some time. Mr. Obama was right not to promise a swift end to the air campaign. At the same time, he should not overestimate the patience of the American people or the weariness of the overstretched military. And as Washington reduces its military role, others, inside and outside NATO, will need to increase theirs. Within NATO, unenthusiastic partners like Germany and Turkey need to at least stay out of the way even if they continue to stand aside from the fighting. 

The president made the right choice to act, but this is a war of choice, not necessity. Presidents should not commit the military to battle without consulting Congress and explaining their reasons to the American people. Fortunately, initial coalition military operations have gone well. Unfortunately, it is the nature of war that they will not always go well. Mr. Obama needs to work with Congress and keep the public fully informed. On Monday, he made an overdue start on that.

Egypt's new Constitution: an update

Nathan Brown 


March 29, 2011  -- The March 19 vote in favor of constitutional amendments in Egypt provides a boost to the military-led transition process and its vigorous electoral schedule. 

The voter turnout was impressive by Egyptian standards – 41 percent of eligible voters, at least double the turnout in any previous national election or referendum – and the victory was overwhelming at 77 percent of voters. But opponents attracted enough votes to make the outcome seem less like the predictable landslides of the authoritarian order. Those who objected to the content of the amendments and, more forcefully, to the process by which they were written and the political sequence they implied marshaled forceful arguments, campaigned hard, and then lost. 

As a consequence, Egypt’s transition process will likely rush forward. What are the next steps? The basic sequence of events is clear, but the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) has not revealed many of the details. Nor has it shared decision-making power over the sequence and rules in any serious way.

The amended articles – most of them governing presidential and parliamentary elections – are now clearly in effect. But the rest of Egypt’s Constitution remains suspended. Egypt’s military rulers have suggested that they will very shortly issue a declaration indicating how authority will be exercised while Egypt’s Parliament and president are elected, which parts of the 1971 Constitution will be brought back into effect, and what their own role will be.

The committee that drafted the amendments also prepared amendments to various laws in order to bring them into conformance with the new provisions. However, announcement of the changes was postponed until after the referendum. The SCAF is expected to issue those laws, which will likely be designed to make elections freer and fairer, by decree. The SCAF has suggested that it will change the law on political parties, making it much easier for new parties to register. The Muslim Brotherhood is one of the many groups that would likely take advantage of such a change. The SCAF might also move from the current electoral system of individual parliamentary districts to a proportional representation system in which at least some of the seats would be allocated by a party’s share of the national vote instead of giving all of them to the winning candidates in each district. But if the SCAF is planning on such a move, it has not tipped its hand.

The SCAF has also suggested that parliamentary elections will be held before presidential elections. Last week, one of its members argued forcefully that attempts to reverse the sequence and have the president elected first (as some have suggested would be preferable because parliamentary elections will be much more complicated than presidential elections) might simply deliver another dictator. But the generals have also suggested that they may push parliamentary elections back from May or June (when they originally suggested they might be held) until September. This is likely a response to those who claim that Egypt’s party system is simply not sufficiently organized for elections in two or three months.

The SCAF initially suggested that it might hold the presidential election in the late summer or early fall; if parliamentary elections are postponed until September, then the presidential election might be pushed back until the end of the year.

Under new nomination procedures contained in the constitutional amendments, a party that gains at least a single seat in the upcoming parliamentary elections will be able to nominate a candidate. (If the Muslim Brotherhood is able to form a party and does gain seats, it has said it will not run its own candidate this time but it might still throw its weight behind one of the candidates who is running.) Independent candidates can get on the ballot either by getting a certain number of endorsements by parliamentary deputies or gathering signatures (30,000) from eligible voters. 

Already some candidates have announced they will run. Most prominent include the following: Amr Moussa, the former foreign minister and current secretary-general of the Arab League. While popular for his Arab nationalist stances, he will have to overcome his association with the past regime, which has already emerged as a major issue in his campaign. 

There is also Mohamed ElBaradei, the former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency and Nobel Prize winner. While respected for his clear articulation of liberal political stances and courage in openly criticizing the Mubarak regime, he will have to overcome a reputation for having an aloof and overly cerebral style. In addition, many Egyptians complain that he has spent (and continues to spend) too much time outside the country to be an appropriate candidate.

Another candidate is Hisham al-Bastawisi, the leader of a group of judges who confronted the Mubarak regime over the last decade. Al-Bastawisi is, like ElBaradei, widely respected but does not appear to be a natural politician.

There is also Ayman Nour, founder of Al-Ghad Party. Nour came in a distant second to former President Hosni Mubarak in 2005 and spent the subsequent four years in prison on politically motivated charges. Known as a born politician and an effective campaigner, and admired for his uncompromising opposition to Mubarak, Nour nonetheless enjoys less of a national reputation than Moussa and ElBaradei.

And there is Hamdeen Sabahi, the founder of the Karama Party, a breakaway from the Nasserist Party that has long sought official licensing. Sabahi, like Nour, has been a key organizer within the opposition and is a gifted politician, but enjoys less widespread popularity than other candidates.

After the new Parliament and president are elected, the provisional Constitution allows (and, according to a reading endorsed by a SCAF member, actually requires) a constituent assembly to be selected to draft an entirely new Constitution. While the opponents to the amendments wished to have this done as the first rather than the last step, they will ultimately get their wish for an entirely new document.

Roger Cohen



March 28, 2011 -- Three Middle Eastern countries have been conspicuous for their stability in the storm. They are Turkey, Lebanon and Israel. An odd mix, you might say, but they have in common that they are places where people vote. 

Democracy is a messy all-or-nothing business. That’s why I love it. You can no more be a little bit democratic than a little bit pregnant. 

Yes, citizens go to the polls in Turkey, Lebanon and Israel and no dictator gets 99.3 percent of the vote. They are lands of opportunity where money is being made and where facile generalizations, for all their popularity, miss the point. Turkey has not turned Islamist, Lebanon is not in the hands of Hezbollah, and Israel is still an open society. 

All three countries, of course, are also wracked by division and imperfection; but then two great merits of democracy are that it finesses division and does not aspire to perfection. 

Speaking of Hezbollah, remember all that alarm a couple of months back when a Hezbollah-backed businessman, Najib Mikati, emerged as prime minister? After that, Lebanon introduced the Libyan no-fly-zone resolution at the United Nations — a rare, if little noted, example of the United States and a Hezbollah-supported government in sync. 

Talk to Hezbollah: That’s obvious. It’s no terrorizing monolith. Mikati is struggling with the give-and-take of Lebanese politics. Life goes on in the freewheeling way that has long drawn repressed, frustrated Arabs to Beirut. 

Hezbollah is a political party with a militia. That’s a big problem. Israel’s ultra-Orthodox Shas party has an outsized influence over Israel because of coalition politics. That’s a problem. The Muslim Brotherhood will loom large in a free Egypt because it has an organizational head start. That may be a problem. Turkey’s ruling Justice and Development Party is a brilliant political machine with a ruthless bent. That’s a problem, too. 

These are problems of different sizes. But give me all these problems so long as they present themselves within open (or opening) systems. They are far preferable to the cowed conformity common to the terrorized societies of the now doomed Arab Jurassic Park, where despots do their worst. 

It’s over: Enough of the nameless graves that whisper of horror, enough of the 20th-century police states in the 21st-century. Yes, it’s over for Ben Ali and for Mubarak. It’s over for Qaddafi, yes it is. How far it’s over for the other Arab despots and autocrats, whether of the oxymoronic “republics” or the royals, will depend on how far they can get out in front of their citizens’ demand to be heard. 

You see, you can’t do Hama any more. You can’t do the Iraqi marshes. Perhaps you can kill dozens, but not tens of thousands. These despots relied on the limitlessness of their terror. It had to be as absolute as their contempt for the law. 

But now people know. They communicate through the clampdowns. They are Facebook-nimble. The despots gaze into their gilded mirrors and, to their horror, see not themselves but the people who will be silenced no longer. They wonder then if their own myriad agents can be trusted. They are caught in their own web. They flail; they have gone too far to turn back but cannot go forward. 

Bashar al-Assad, the embattled Syrian president, was about to say something Sunday, before deciding not to. He was trained in west London as an eye doctor. He’d better stop thinking Hama — where his father murdered at least 10,000 — and start thinking Hammersmith. 

Questions swirl. Who are the Libyan rebels? Who are the angry of Latakia? The Arab transitions will be long and bumpy — like those that brought representative government to Latin America and Central Europe and wide swathes of Asia — but now that fear has been overcome, they are irreversible. 

Here’s who the protesters are: people like Asmaa Mahfouz, 26, the Egyptian woman who on Jan. 18 made a video urging citizens to go to Tahrir Square on Jan. 25 — the demonstration that would start the revolution. She said then: “We’ll go down and demand our rights, our fundamental human rights. I won’t even talk about any political rights. We just want our human rights and nothing else.” And she said people “don’t have to come to Tahrir Square, just go down anywhere and say it, that we are free human beings.” And: “This is enough!” 

People are being born throughout the Middle East. They are discovering their capacity to change things, their inner “Basta!” That’s how the Arab spring began on Dec. 17 in the little town of Sidi Bouzid in Tunisia — with a fruit peddler’s “enough” to humiliation. In my end is my beginning. 

Three months later the genie is not only out of the bottle, it’s shattered the bottle. I said of Libya in an earlier column: Be ruthless or stay out. So now the West is in, be ruthless. Arm the resurgent rebels. Incapacitate Qaddafi. Do everything short of putting troops on the ground. Qaddafi, as President Obama has said, “must leave.” So that Libya can be an Arab country that is imperfect but open.

The West still beats the rest, but it may no longer be best

Robert Skidelsky 


March 29, 2011  -- History has no final verdicts. Major shifts in events and power bring about new subjects for discussion and new interpretations.

Fifty years ago, as decolonization accelerated, no one had a good word to say for imperialism. It was regarded as unambiguously bad, both by ex-imperialists and by their liberated subjects. Schoolchildren were taught about the horrors of colonialism, how it exploited conquered peoples. There was little mention, if any, of imperialism’s benefits.

Then, in the 1980s, a revisionist history came along. It wasn’t just that distance lends a certain enchantment to any view. The West – mainly the Anglo-American part of it – had recovered some of its pride and nerve under U.S. President Ronald Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. And there was the growing evidence of post-colonial regimes’ failure, violence and corruption, especially in Africa.

But the decisive event for the revisionists was the collapse of the Soviet empire, which not only left the United States top dog globally, but also seemed, to the more philosophically minded, to vindicate Western civilization and values against all other civilizations and values. With the European Union extending its frontiers to embrace many ex-communist states, the West became again, if briefly, the embodiment of universal reason, obliged and equipped to spread its values to the still-benighted parts of the world. Francis Fukuyama’s “The End of History and the Last Man” testified to this sense of triumph and historical duty.

Such a conjuncture set the stage for a new wave of imperialism (though the reluctance to use the word remained). In doing so, it was bound to affect interpretations of the old imperialism, which was now extolled for spreading economic progress, the rule of law, and science and technology to countries that would never have benefited from them otherwise.

Foremost among the new generation of revisionist historians was Niall Ferguson of Harvard University, whose television series, based on his new book “Civilization: The West and the Rest,” has just started showing in Britain. In its first episode, Ferguson appears amid the splendid monuments of China’s Ming Dynasty, which, in the 15th century, was undoubtedly the greatest civilization of the day, with its naval expeditions reaching the coasts of Africa. After that, it was all downhill for China (and “the rest”) and all uphill for the West.

Ferguson snazzily summarizes the reasons for this reversal in six “killer apps:” competition, science, property rights, medicine, the consumer society and the work ethic. Against such tools – unique products of Western civilization – the rest had no chance. From such a perspective, imperialism, old and new, has been a beneficent influence, because it has been the means of spreading these “apps” to the rest of the world, thereby enabling them to enjoy the fruits of progress hitherto confined to a few Western countries.

Understandably, this thesis has not met with universal approbation. The historian Alex von Tunzelmann accused Ferguson of leaving out all of imperialism’s nasty bits: the Black War in Australia, the German genocide in Namibia, the Belgian exterminations in the Congo, the Amritsar Massacre, the Bengal Famine, the Irish potato famine, and much else.

But that is the weakest line of attack. Edward Gibbon once described history as being little better than a record of the “crimes, follies and misfortunes of mankind.” Imperialism certainly added its quota to these. But the question is whether it also provided, through Hegel’s “cunning of reason,” the means to escape from them. Even Marx justified British rule in India on these grounds. Ferguson, too, can make a sound argument for such a proposition.

The most serious weakness in Ferguson’s presentation is his lack of sympathy for the civilizations dismissed as “the rest,” which also points to the most serious limitation of the revisionist case. The “triumph of the West” that followed the collapse of communism in Europe was clearly not the “end of history.” As Ferguson must know, the main topic of discussion in international affairs nowadays concerns the “rise” of China, and more generally Asia, as well as the stirring of Islam.

Of course, the Chinese may prefer to talk about “restoration” rather than “rise,” and point to a “harmonious” pluralism of the future. But “rise” is how most people think of China’s recent history, and in history the rise of some is usually associated with the decline of others. In other words, we may be reverting to that cyclical pattern that historians assumed to be axiomatic before the seemingly irreversible rise of the West implanted in them a view of linear progress toward greater reason and freedom.

Europe is plainly in decline, politically and culturally, though most Europeans, blinded by their high living standards and the pretensions of their impotent statesmen, are happy to dress this up as progress. Chinese savings are underwriting much of the American civilizing mission that Ferguson applauds. The pattern seems clear: the West is losing dynamism, and the rest are gaining it.

The remainder of this century will show how this shift plays out. For the moment, most of us have lost the historical plot. It is possible, for example, to imagine a “Western world” (one that applies Ferguson’s “killer apps”) in which the actual West is no longer the dominant factor: America will simply pass the torch to China, as Britain once did to America.

But it seems to me extremely unlikely that China, India and “the rest” will simply take over Western values wholesale, for this would amount to renouncing any value in their own civilizations. Some syntheses and accommodations between the West and the rest will inevitably accompany the shift in power and wealth from the former to the latter. The only question is whether the process will be peaceful.

Norway to Jews: You're Not Welcome Here 

Alan M. Dershowitz 



MARCH 29, 2011 -- I recently completed a tour of Norwegian universities, where I spoke about international law as applied to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But the tour nearly never happened. 

Its sponsor, a Norwegian pro-Israel group, offered to have me lecture without any charge to the three major universities. Norwegian universities generally jump at any opportunity to invite lecturers from elsewhere. When my Harvard colleague Stephen Walt, co-author of The Israel Lobby, came to Norway, he was immediately invited to present a lecture at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. Likewise with Ilan Pappe, a demonizer of Israel who teaches at Oxford.

My hosts expected, therefore, that their offer to have me present a different academic perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would be eagerly accepted. I have written half a dozen books on the subject presenting a centrist view in support of the two-state solution. But the universities refused. 

The dean of the law faculty at Bergen University said he would be honored to have me present a lecture on the O.J. Simpson case, as long as I was willing to promise not to mention Israel. An administrator at the Trondheim school said that Israel was too controversial. 

The University of Oslo simply said no without offering an excuse. That led one journalist to wonder whether the Norwegian universities believe that I am not entirely house-trained.

Only once before have I been prevented from lecturing at universities in a country. The other country was Apartheid South Africa.

Despite the faculties' refusals to invite me, I delivered three lectures to packed auditoriums at the invitation of student groups. I received sustained applause both before and after the talks. 

It was then that I realized why all this happened. At all of the Norwegian universities, there have been efforts to enact academic and cultural boycotts of Jewish Israeli academics. This boycott is directed against Israel's occupation of Palestinian land—but the occupation that the boycott supporters have in mind is not of the West Bank but rather of Israel itself. Here is the first line of their petition: Since 1948 the state of Israel has occupied Palestinian land . . . 

The administrations of the universities have refused to go along with this form of collective punishment of all Israeli academics, so the formal demand for a boycott failed. But in practice it exists. Jewish pro-Israel speakers are subject to a de facto boycott. 

The first boycott signatory was Trond Adresen, a professor at Trondheim. About Jews, he has written: There is something immensely self-satisfied and self-centered at the tribal mentality that is so prevalent among Jews. . . . [They] as a whole, are characterized by this mentality. . . . It is no less legitimate to say such a thing about Jews in 2008-2009 than it was to make the same point about the Germans around 1938.

This line of talk—directed at Jews, not Israel—is apparently acceptable among many in Norway's elite. Consider former Prime Minister Kare Willock's reaction to President Obama's selection of Rahm Emanuel as his first chief of staff: It does not look too promising, he has chosen a chief of staff who is Jewish. Mr. Willock didn't know anything about Mr. Emanuel's views—he based his criticism on the sole fact that Mr. Emanuel is a Jew. Perhaps unsurprisingly, fewer than 1,000 Jews live in Norway today. 

The country's foreign minister recently wrote an article justifying his contacts with Hamas. He said that the essential philosophy of Norway is dialogue. That dialogue, it turns out, is one-sided. Hamas and its supporters are invited into the dialogue, but supporters of Israel are excluded by an implicit, yet very real, boycott against pro-Israel views. 



Mr. Dershowitz is a law professor at Harvard. His latest novel is The Trials of Zion (Grand Central Publishing, 2010).

done something bold: Acknowledge that the age of Jewish settlement
is over. He did mention, fleetingly, that certain settlements would be
set adrift in a theoretical peace deal. But he seemed unaware that he
was delivering a speech that could easily have been given 10 years
ago.

It is not 10 years ago. Israel is now 10 years closer to achieving full
pariah status. And -- in part because the Palestinians lack the patience
to pursue a strategy of gradual, irreversible entanglement -- a moment
of truth for Israel is rapidly approaching.

UN Vote

The Palestinians are seeking a UN vote in September on
independence. They will prevail in the General Assembly, though not
in the Security Council. President Barack Obama, with whom
Netanyahu just picked a fight, will have to spend a good amount of
political capital to stymie the Palestinian campaign, even though he
appears to have nothing but contempt for Netanyahu’s lack of vision.
But American opposition to this unilateral declaration will be in
many ways immaterial. Israel will soon enough be seen by most of
the world as the occupier not of disputed territory but of a foreign
country. The Palestinians will wake up to find that a General
Assembly vote did not, in fact, give them true independence. And
then there will be an explosion.

The Palestinians who are watching Yemenis, Libyans and Syrians
fighting for their freedom will soon be inspired to once again take up
their own fight.

Existential Threats

Netanyahu, who understands the existential threat posed by Iran, does
not seem to understand the nature of this other existential threat. His
five predecessors as prime minister -- including Ariel Sharon, whose
heart did not bleed for Palestinians -- understood it. President Obama
understands it, too.

is 1900 by 1000 pixels with 32 bits of color depth and 100 frames per
second. This is a great deal better — if you enjoy watching sport or nature
documentaries, the additional resolution is amazing. This still falls far
short of reality. An IMAX theatre gives a wrap-around image of about
10,000 by 7,000 pixels and comes closer to the average resolution of the
human eye, estimated at about 30,000 by 20,000 pixels. But the eye cheats.
It concentrates the rods and cones in the central portion of the retina.
Although IMAX achieves the average pixel density of your eye, it comes
nowhere near the peak density which is nearly 10,000 times greater.

For a truly equivalent experience, we would need about 320 million
pixels per eye at a frame rate of 120 frames per second, allowing us full
stereo synthesis. At this speed and resolution, we are matching the visual
acuity of the eye and should be able to fool it completely. But there is
one more problem to overcome: The image is not interactive. Move your
head in the real world and the image will change. The objects in the
foreground will vary their position in relation to the background, so-
called motion parallax. Try it now, move your head and you will see that
the book, or screen you are reading moves in relation to the background.
In a simple digitized 3D image this will not happen. You will have a 3D
image but you will not have a real image, a light field.

To create a real image you need to view a hologram or use head-
tracking technology. A hologram records the light waves given off by
an object in multiple directions rather than just the intensity of the light
striking the camera through a single focal point. When you shine a laser
back through the hologram, it regenerates the light waves as they would
have originally come from the object. That light can be viewed from
different directions, giving the impression of three dimensions rather
than a mere two-dimensional photograph. There is often a limitation in
viewing angle because the original photographic plate must wrap all the
way around an object to capture the full 3D light field, but the illusion is
very convincing.

A more effective way to create a real experience — and one with no
restriction on viewing angle — is to construct the image in a computer
and track the movement of your head. The computer can create the
two-dimensional images each eye would see if the scene were truly
three-dimensional. Computer software resolves motion parallax and a
host of other elements, but to do so the computer must understand a
model of the world so it can calculate how the scene would look from a
particular angle and in the appropriate lighting. Some recent games such
as Activision's ‘Call of Duty’ do this, and the experience is compelling.

itself away if all you have to go on are electrical readings. (I dare say the
cat would make its displeasure know if left in there for any time.) The
contents are, therefore, said to be black box equivalent.

The reason for teaching engineers about black boxes is to help them
understand how to simplify things. We could construct option four, with
a cat and some food, but it would cost a great deal of money. Option 1 is
functionally identical from an electrical point of view, but for a fraction
of the cost. Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs were so successful when they
started Apple because Wozniak was brilliant at simplifying logic circuits.
He could take a design with thirty chips and come back with a black box
equivalent solution using only five. It was a fraction of the cost and far
more reliable.

Scientists put great store in black box equivalence because of
a principle called Occam’s Razor. William of Occam was an English
Franciscan friar living in the fourteenth century. He proposed the idea
of minimal explanation. It states that, ‘among competing hypotheses,
the hypothesis with the fewest assumptions should be selected? When
trying to explain the workings of a black box, the more complicated
inner workings should be discarded, as they have no externally verifiable
effect over the simpler mechanism. Our extraneous animal must be
eliminated! Sorry.

Ironically, given his calling, Occam’s Razor is sometimes wheeled
out as a disproof of the existence of God. Surely God is a complication
unnecessary to the explanation of our Universe. The argument is
illustrated beautifully in Carl Sagan’s book Contact and the film of the
same name. God gets the last laugh in Sagan’s book when the difficulty
with Occam’s Razor is brought into sharp focus. Occam's Razor contains
an inherent paradox. At any moment in time we only have evidence to
support the simplest of explanations, yet we know many of these simple
explanations are incomplete. We regularly discover new phenomenon —
dark matter and dark energy being some recent examples. If we stopped
discovering new things, Occam's Razor would be a good way to simplify
our thoughts. Occam’s Razor is a useful intellectual tool to prevent us
over complicating explanations, but there will often be explanations that
are correct, but for which there is not yet any observed effect.

If we go back to our black box example, we see the flaw in concluding
the boxes are identical from examining only their inputs and outputs.
Opening them would clearly show they are not identical! But, how would
this fact reveal itself if they remain closed? The answer is: over time. If
something in the box has memory or understanding, it could present
one set of results for a while and a completely different set of results later.

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025106.txt,"Pardon the formality below - I want to approach your very legitimate questions / concerns in a serious
manner.
Attached and below the same.

Dear Jeffrey:

As requested, the following addresses your two questions / concerns about our proposed Closer To Truth TV
series “The Science of Sleep and Dreams”:

(i) Have there been sufficient breakthroughs in Sleep and Dreams (significantly beyond traditional
understandings) to justify a major TV series?

(11) Even if ‘yes’ to (1), is now the proper time for such a foundational series, or are more years needed for
corroborative studies and further research to solidify the breakthroughs?

In preparing this response, my primary source is Professor Patrick McNamara, Department of Neurology,
Boston University School of Medicine, with whom CTT Producer/Director Peter Getzels and I spoke with at
length today. Patrick is one of the leading sleep and dream researchers (he himself more dreams). More
importantly, he is perhaps the leading chronicler of the field, with many publications (including 26 entries in
related encyclopedias). He is co-editor-in-chief of the “Encyclopedia of Sleep and Dreams” (2012) and

the sole author of the forthcoming “An Introduction to the Neuroscience of Sleep and Dreams” (Cambridge
University Press, 2018), which intends to present the latest science and to become a main textbook for
graduate courses/seminars. Patrick is a CTT contributor and colleague.

When we asked Patrick, his first response — “This is the ideal time to tell the sleep-and-dreams story” — and he
cited (in essence) your two questions, in that (i) the multiple breakthroughs are now sufficiently well
corroborated by numerous independent labs such that a substantial foundation for the new, deeper
understanding of sleep and dreams is now for the first time (over the past few years) confirmed and
established, and (11) there are now interesting application and critical clinical questions to pose, explore and
pursue, such as for the treatment of various mental-related illnesses that have known sleep-related syndromes
(e.g., PTSD and Depression).

To understand the significance of recent breakthroughs, a defining characteristic of sleep and dreams is that
there are two distinct kinds of sleep - REM (rapid-eye-movement) Sleep and NREM (non-rapid-eye-
movement) Sleep. Most dreams are associated with REM sleep (though complex). The eye movement

gives the eponymous name, but a more important designation defines the two stages in terms of brain waves
(electroencephalograph — EEG): REM is Fast-Wave Sleep (similar to the waking state) and NREM Sleep is
Slow-Wave Sleep (very different from the waking state). This difference between REM and NREM sleep has
been known since 1953 (different EEGs since 1937), but its deep significance has only been discovered and
confirmed in very recent years (as explained below).

Following are the key areas of breakthrough in sleep and dreams (from Patrick). Patrick states that these are
now reproducible, non-controversial, and well-accepted among experts, although still not appreciated by the
public - hence the high value of our CTT TV series. The organizing idea is why and how are sleep and dreams
essential for normal memory consolidation and bodily health / well-being.

Memory Consolidation. There is a fundamental difference between REM and NREM Sleep for memory
consolidation: REM is for emotional memories, whereas NREM is for declarative and procedural memories.
Hence, understanding and dealing with REM emotional memories can lead to treatment for the many
neuropsychiatric illnesses that have sleep/dream-related disorders or syndromes (Parkinson’s Disease,

She also, according to the government, evaded sales taxes on expensive jewelry in New York
(which has a sales tax) by having the jeweler send empty boxes to Florida (which has no sales
tax). Asa result, she may have saved several thousand dollars, but she spent more than a year in
prison, when she had only a few years left to live and even less time to spend with her dying
husband. By any rational calculus, this is crazy behavior.

Mike Tyson, as the world’s greatest boxer, had a limited career ahead of him but virtually
unlimited access to sex. As with many famous athletes, women were falling all over him, sending
him “audition” tapes, waiting for him wherever he appeared and begging him to have sex with
him. Yet, he agreed to be alone in a hotel room with a young woman he had just met and to risk
being falsely accused of rape — which, in my view, he was — in order to get even more sex. The
result was that he was sentenced to several years in prison near the end of his short career, and
lost almost everything he had worked so hard to acquire. Even he later acknowledged to me that
he was a “schmuck” for risking so much for so little.

In both of these cases, celebrities risked what they had limited amounts of — in Helmsley’s
situation the few remaining years of her life and her time with her husband; in Tyson’s situation
the few remaining years of his career — in order to obtain more of what they had unlimited
amounts of: money and sex. Of course, neither one expected to be convicted for what they did,
but they both engaged in behavior that carried the risk of being deprived of what they had only
limited amounts of. No rationally calculating person, weighing the costs and benefits of taking
such risky actions, would do so. But these celebrities — and many others who have consulted me
— have done just that.

Some of my celebrity clients have also gotten into trouble because they need, or feel entitled to,
immediate gratification without sufficiently considering the longer term implications of their
conduct, not only to themselves and their careers but to their loved ones, friend and associates.
They believe that when the future finally arrives, there will be new quick fixes. And often they
are right. Someone generally manages to clean up the mess they left behind. It requires a
combination of unlikely factors and some bad luck to produce disaster, since most successful
people are good at making problems go away. But even celebrities are subject to the law of
probabilities and eventually — if they persist in their reckless behavior — the statistics will likely
catch up with them.

Why do so many celebrities act so recklessly? Is there something special about being a celebrity
that makes one feel invulnerable to ordinary risks? Are they so accustomed to “getting away with
it” that they weigh costs and benefits differently from ordinary people?

Is there a sense of entitlement? Are there expectations that the rules don’t apply to them? Do
they feel guilty about their “undeserved” success and want to be caught? Do they surround
themselves with groupies who encourage bad behavior and refuse to be truthful with them about
the risks? Are temptations placed so readily before them that they become difficult to resist?

One answer may well be that some of them have been doing it all their lives, starting well before
they were rich and famous. People often have a hard time changing old habits. I know that no

matter how much money I now have, I cannot throw away a tea bag after using it only once. It
drives my family crazy to see soggy tea bags in a cup waiting to be reused, but I simply can’t

The journalist had confirmed that several prominent names—
Mort Zuckerman, the famous real estate mogul and publisher; 
Microsoft executive Nathan Myhrvold; and Donald Trump 
among them—had dined at the residence. She'd interviewed 
several of Epstein's friends and ex-friends: Nobel Prize—winning 
scientists, financiers who worked with Epstein at Bear Stearns. 
She'd handled Steven Hoffenberg with aplomb. And, working 
with Vanity Fair's editors, she'd figured out ways to slip even more 
information between the lines, in ways that would allow readers 
to form their own questions about Epstein's finances. 
In that respect, she'd fulfilled her original assignment perfectly. 
What Carter needed to figure out was what to do with the 
artist, her sister, and their mother's story. But before he could 
swipe his key card to let himself into the magazine's offices, Car-
ter saw a man standing in the reception area. 
The man was motionless. He'd been waiting for Carter. 
It was Jeffrey Epstein. Nonplussed, Carter invited him into 
his office. 
Epstein denied the claims involving underage women. No crimi-
nal charges had been filed. And so Vanity Fair decided not to 
include the claims in Ward's article. But, according to Ward, 
when her editor Doug Stumpf called her, she cried. 
She'd worked so hard on the piece, gotten so stressed out that 
one of her twins had begun to grow more slowly than the other. 
On doctor's orders; she'd been put on bed rest.

JAMES PATTERSON 
Why? she asked when she got to speak to Carter directly. 
He's sensitive about the young women. And we still get to 
run most of the piece. 
In her notebook, Ward wrote down the rest of what Carter 
had said: I believe him, he told her. I'm Canadian. 
But the piece that came out, in the March issue, still created a 
sensation. It was called The Talented Mr. Epstein in a sly refer-
ence to Patricia Highsmith's celebrated suspense novel The Tal-
ented Mr. Ripley. The film adaptation, by Anthony Minghella, was 
still fresh in the minds of Vanity Fair's readers. For Graydon 
Carter, just posing the question Is Epstein some sort of scam artist, 
like Ripley? had been question enough. And throughout the 
piece, there were ironies readers wouldn't miss as they drew 
their own conclusions about Epstein's life story. It came through 
clearly in the first line of the last paragraph of Ward's 7,500-word 
story: Many people comment there is something innocent, 
almost childlike about Jeffrey Epstein. 
In context, the word innocent was rather ironic—so much so 
that it almost became its own opposite.

CHAPTER 39 
Todd Meister: June 2015 
Harry Cipriani, on Fifth Avenue, is a New York institu-
tion. The restaurant began its life as an American out-
post of Harry's Bar—which was itself a famous American 
outpost in Venice. Located inside the Sherry-Netherland hotel, 
it's a theme restaurant—the theme being money. And today, a 
hedge-fund manager named Todd Meister is talking about a very 
wealthy man—Jeffrey Epstein—whom he knows through his 
father, Epstein's sometime friend Bob Meister. 
I've known Jeffrey since I was nineteen, Meister says. So 
let me tell you what I know—whatever everyone knows and 
everybody else says. First Off, he's no billionaire. Second off—
and here's why—he has no clue how to invest. He has people do 
that for him. 
Meister knows how to invest. He does it for other people and, as 
the son of a superrich father, for himself. He also knows about the 
153

good life. Parties in Vegas; weekends in the Hamptons; affairs with 
beautiful women that end up getting splashed all over the tabloids. 
It makes sense that, once upon a time, he and Epstein would 
have gotten along. 
As for the girls, Meister says, that was just business. He'd 
seat them strategically at client dinners. When he went to the 
movies, he'd take three or four girls with him. They'd take turns 
massaging his back, arms, and legs. 
According to Meister, Epstein used to boast that he liked to 
go into insane asylums because he liked to fuck crazy women. 
Who knows if it's true? Meister adds. But I'm telling you, 
he used to say it. 
From time to time, Epstein's friends and acquaintances would 
see sides of Epstein that he'd grown much less shy about sharing. 
Epstein encouraged Alan Dershowitz to invest with a prominent 
hedge-fund manager named Orin Kramer. Dershowitz did, and he 
made a lot of money at first. But in 2008, the fund Dershowitz had 
invested in lost a substantial amount. Afterward, according to a for-
mer associate of Epstein's, Epstein appeared in Kramer's midtown 
Manhattan office. There, sources say, he told Kramer: It's very much 
in your interest to make Alan Dershowitz whole. 
Epstein's intervention worked, and Dershowitz recovered his 
money. 
To people who'd known Epstein back in the 1980s, this kind of 
behavior was out of character. But the thing about Epstein was 
that you never could figure him out. One minute he was charming.

The most charming man you'd ever meet. The next he was snarl, 
threat, and bluster. Something didn't add up. So you'd run the 
numbers: this many parties, that many women. Even with the 
connection to Victoria's Secret, the women didn't add up, either. 
Throw in the modeling agency, it makes more sense. Then 
you plug in the parties. The scene brings Eyes Wide Shut to mind. 
But the thing is, Eyes Wide Shut only works in the shadows. For 
Epstein, getting on that plane with Clinton was more like a 
moment in Caddyshack — the one in which the groundhog peeks 
out from his hole in the golf course. From there on in, Jeffrey 
Epstein was like the mole in a game of whack-a-mole. It was only 
a matter of time before he'd be caught. But the question you had 
to ask yourself was, are people like Epstein born without mor-
als? Or are their morals like snakeskin—just something they 
shed (along with all the other basic, day-to-day concerns that 
everyday working people have) as they make their way into that 
Eyes Wide Shut world? 
Todd Meister, who was married to Nicky Hilton and stole the 
heiress Samantha Boardman away from Conde Nast's former 
editorial director James Truman, should know. He wonders out 
loud: 
How does a yutz like Epstein get beautiful women? 
At Harry Cipriani, the question lingers in the air.

PART IV 
The Investigation 
CHAPTER 40 
Michael Reiter: January 2006 
1 
As far as Michael Reiter's concerned, the case that his team 
has built against Epstein—slowly, meticulously, over the 
course of an entire year—is airtight. Even now, Detective 
Recarey's finding new pieces of evidence. And already Reiter's 
been laying the groundwork with prosecutors. State attorney 
Barry Krischer has a reputation for toughness. He's known, 
nationally, for his prosecution of juvenile offenders. And Reiter's 
been keeping him abreast of the investigation. With Jeffrey 
Epstein, it's not simply a matter of seeing him punished. It's a 
matter of getting a sexual predator off the streets of Palm Beach. 
Krischer assures the chief that he's taking this case very 
seriously. 
The state attorney's office will have Reiter's back at every 
turn. 
I told him that we had an investigation that was very serious

the suit that was later settled by Epstein. That it was of a sexual 
nature. I was concerned that we had not reached all of the vic-
tims, and we hadn't, I'm sure, at this point. I told him that I felt 
like the suspect would probably become aware of the investiga-
tion at some point and that we should probably expect some con-
tact from.. . Mr. Epstein's lawyers. And I told him that I wanted 
to keep him very well informed on this and that I hoped that he 
would do the same. And that we would have to have more con-
tact in making sure it was handled responsibly, intelligently, and 
appropriately as it moved forward. 
Reiter would say that Epstein's name did not seem to ring a 
bell with the state attorney. But shortly afterward, the chief 
became aware that in certain powerful circles his investigation 
was being looked upon unfavorably. I had many people-related 
conversations ... on the cocktail-party circuit that suggested we 
approach this in a way that wasn't necessary, he would say. 
Michael Reiter was a good cop. A good man. But he was about 
to discover that when it came to men with the power and influ-
ence Epstein wielded, fairness under the law was a relative, mal-
leable concept.

CHAPTER 41 
Detective Recarey: February 2006 
IFor months, Joe Recarey's been interviewing girls who'd 
been brought to Epstein's house, subpoenaing telephone 
and car-rental records, conducting surveillance. Ultimately, 
according to a source within the Palm Beach PD, the department 
would identify forty-seven underage girls who'd been molested 
on El Brillo Way. 
Recarey interviewed one of Epstein's pilots, a man named 
David Rogers, as well as Epstein's houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez. 
He also spoke to a woman who really was a massage therapist. 
It turned out that Epstein paid just one hundred dollars for 
actual Swedish deep-tissue massages that the therapist provided 
for him and his friends, the lawyer Alan Dershowitz among 
them. 
Did anything untoward ever happen? Recarey asked. Had 
pstein ever asked the woman to rub his chest? 
161 
JAMES PATTERSON 
No, she told him. She wasn't Epstein's type. The girls she'd 
seen at his house were very thin and beautiful and did not have 
tattoos. This massage therapist had several tattoos that were vis-
ible, and on quite a few occasions Epstein and Ghislaine Max-
well had made negative comments about them. 
According to a Palm Beach Police Department Incident Report 
filed by Recarey on July 25, 2006, the detective had also heard 
from Mary's father, who said that a private eye had been to his 
house, photographing his family and chasing visitors away. 
Mary's dad had gotten the license plate—Florida E79-4EG. 
Recarey traced it back to one Ivan Robles of West Palm Beach. 
Robles turned out to be a licensed private investigator. 
Recarey informed the state's attorney's office. 
Alison also contacted Recarey and told him that she'd been 
approached by someone who was in touch with Epstein. Alison 
had been told that she'd receive money if she would refuse to 
cooperate with the police. 
Those who help him will be compensated, she was told, 
according to Detective Recarey's incident report. And those who 
hurt him will be dealt with. 
Recarey reassured the girl and told her that tampering with a 
witness in a case like this was a serious, arrestable offense. 
Then he told an assistant state attorney. 
The detective was leaving no i undotted and no t uncrossed. 
But he did wonder if the state attorney's office itself had 
become part of the problem.

CHAPTER 42 
Barry Krischer: April 2006 
State attorney Barry Krischer was an elected official, but 
before taking his post, he'd been a lawyer in private practice 
in and around Palm Beach. Elected twice to his office, in 
1992 and 1996, he had run unopposed for state attorney in 2000 
and 2004. During the course of his long career, which began in 
1970 with a three-year stint in the district attorney's office in 
Brooklyn, he received a number of awards: the pro bono award 
from the Legal Aid Society of Palm Beach County for his service 
with the juvenile justice system and for his work with the child 
protection team; the Peace at Home award, presented by Gover-
nor jeb Bush, for his work with victims of family violence; a life-
time achievement award from the Florida Bar. He was a board 
member of the National District Attorneys Association. And he 
was not necessarily averse to going after the rich and powerful. 
In 2003, he launched an investigation into Rush Limbaugh's use 
163 
JAMES PATTERSON 
of, and means of obtaining, oxycodone and hydrocodone. (A few 
years after Limbaugh's arrest, which coincided with Chief Reit-
er's investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, the talk-show host settled 
with prosecutors, agreed to submit to random drug testing, and 
gave up his firearms permit.) 
Krischer himself, however, had been accused of sexual 
misconduct. 
In October of 1992, Jodi Bergeron, a legal secretary who'd worked 
for Krischer, filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against him in the 
Palm Beach County circuit court. That suit was dismissed, but a few 
months later, the woman took Krischer to federal court, accusing 
him of making unwanted advances and demanding recompense for 
battery, negligence, invasion of privacy, and emotional distress. 
Krischer had placed his hands, violently, inside her blouse, 
the woman said. He'd forcibly fondled her breasts, forcibly kissed 
her, and rubbed her shoulders while brushing her buttocks with 
his hands and knees, all while accompanying the gestures with 
verbal advances. 
When she declined those advances, the woman claimed, 
Krischer fired her. 
Krischer denied the allegations. At the time, he was making his 
first run for the state attorney's office. The charges were politically 
motivated, he said. Members of a local chapter of NOW—the 
National Organization for Women—had stood by the lawyer, cit-
ing his efforts to stop domestic violence, among his other virtues. 
I am here to support Barry Krischer for the work his office 
did in my daughter's case, one woman said during a rally that 
took place in front of the courthouse. Her murderer received 
the maximum sentence, a life sentence.

o been dismissed—after Krischer's 
164 
former law firm agreed to pay Bergeron's attorney seven thou-
sand dollars in legal fees. 
Now Chief Reiter and Detective Recarey were beginning to have 
their own questions about Barry Krischer. The Palm Beach PD 
wanted to charge Epstein with one count of lewd and lascivious 
behavior and four counts of unlawful sexual activity with a 
minor—felony charges that would have amounted to years 
behind bars in the case of a conviction. Wendy Dobbs and Sarah 
Kellen would be charged as accomplices. 
This was not the plan that Krischer seemed to have in mind 
for Jeffrey Epstein. 
In cases involving the sexual abuse of minors, prosecuting 
attorneys tend to have suspects arrested, then push for a trial. 
But instead of granting his approval for an arrest, Krischer told 
the police that he would convene a grand jury, which would be 
asked to consider a broad range of charges. 
In a case such as Epstein's, this was highly unusual. Not damn-
ing in and of itself. But very strange. In Florida, grand juries are 
only required in capital cases. At the state attorney's discretion, they 
may also be called in controversial cases—for instance, cases 
involving crimes committed by public officials. But Jeffrey Epstein 
wasn't a public official, and as far as the Palm Beach PD was con-
cerned, the only controversial thing about the case they'd built was 
that Epstein was rich and well connected. In his deposition for 
B.B. vs. Epstein, Chief Reiter rel ayed Krischer's concerns: the pros-
ecutor had to make sure that his case was solid, beyond a reason-
able doubt. And Krischer did have his doubts about the credibility 
of the young women who'd be called to testify against Epstein. 
165 
JAMES PATTERSON 
Even so, Reiter was beginning to wonder if Krischer was 
stacking the deck in Epstein's favor—if, thanks to the sway 
prosecutors have over grand juries, assembling such a jury 
wasn't an excellent way to let Epstein off with the lightest pun-
ishment possible. 
Another unusual thing: the way Barry Krischer and the law-
yers working for him ignored Chief Reiter's multiple phone calls 
as well as Detective Recarey's— even though the police had been 
hearing from Epstein's own lawyers. 
[Krischer] and I had an excellent relationship, Chief Reiter 
said in his deposition. I was the speaker at his swearing-in cere-
mony. And that he wouldn't return my phone calls—I mean, it 
was clear to me by his actions that he could not objectively look 
at this case. 
In the incident report he ended up writing, Detective Recarey 
remembered a phone call that he received from Guy Fronstin, 
one of the lawyers representing Epstein. 
It was a message Epstein wanted to send, something central to 
the case that demanded explanation. The whole shit show swirling 
around him was just a misunderstanding—a misrepresentation—
of Epstein's actual interests and intentions. 
Fronstin says Mr. Epstein is very passionate about massages, 
Detective Recarey would write. 
And: Mr. Epstein had donated over $100,000 to the Ballet o 
Florida for massages. 
And: The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound for 
him. That is why he has had so many massages.

CHAPTER 43 
Palm Beach Police Department Incident Report Filed 
by Detective Joseph Recarey: July 25, 2006 
On April 13 and April 14, 2006, I attempted contact on sev-
eral occasions with ASA [assistant state attorney Daliah] 
Weiss and ASA [Latina] Belohlavek to ascertain when the 
victims needed to report for Grand Jury testimony. Messages 
were left on their voicemail. On April 17, 2006, during the 
hours of 9:00 am and 11:30 am I again left messages for ASA 
Weiss and ASA Belohlavek for either of them to return my 
call as I had not heard from the State Attorney's Office as to 
the time and date of the Grand Jury. 
At approximately 12:30 pm, I went to the State Attor-
ney's Office and Located ASA Weiss and ASA Belohlavek in 
their offices. I entered ASA Belohlavek's office who informed 
me that she was going to return my call. She explained that 
an offer was made to the Defense, Atty Guy Fronstin and 
167 
JAMES PATTERSON 
Atty Alan Dershowitz. The offer is 1 count of Agg Assault 
with intent to commit a felony, five years probation, with 
adjudication withheld. Epstein would have to submit to psy-
chiatric/sexual evaluation and no unsupervised visits with 
minors. When asked about all the other victims, ASA 
Belohlavek stated that was the only offer made as to one vic-
tim, [Mary]. ASA Belohlaveles] cell phone rang and went to 
voice mail. She checked her voice mail and played the mes-
sage on speaker. The caller identified himself as Atty Guy 
Fronstin and acknowledged the deal made between them. 
Fronstin stated in the message, he spoke with his client, Jef-
frey Epstein, and would agree to this deal. Fronstin asked to 
call off the grand jury as they would accept this deal. 
Belohlavek stated a probable cause would be needed to book 
Epstein in the county Jail and would let me know as to when 
it was needed. I explained my disapproval of the deal and not 
being consulted prior to the deal being offered. However I 
expressed that was only my opinion and the final approval 
would come from the Chief of Police. She explained to have 
Chief Reiter call Barry Krischer about the deal. I left the 
area and returned to the police station where I briefed the 
Chief about the deal offered. 
I checked my voice mail messages and discovered a mes-
sage from [the] stepmother for the victim [Mary]. She was 
calling because the State Attorney's Office still had not 
returned any of her calls as to when they are needed for this 
case. I then called ASA Belohlavek's office and left messages 
for her to call the victims on this case and explain to them 
what the State Attorney's Office had done.

Michael Reiter: May 2006 
A plea offer? 
Chief Reiter is outraged. His team has logged thou-
sands of hours of work. They've assembled mountains of 
evidence. But instead of going to trial, the state attorney wants to 
see Epstein get off with a misdemeanor, five years of probation, 
and a psych exam. 
Why? 
Alan Dershowitz has presented the prosecutors with his own 
pieces of evidence—printouts from the victims' Myspace pages. 
In her About Me column, under Best physical feature, 
Mary has written Ass and eyes.

JAMES PATTERSON 
Under [Do] you wanna lose your virginity: I already lost it. 
One of the victims has been caught with drugs and arrested. 
She's also been caught stealing from Victoria's Secret. From the 
state attorney's perspective, these girls look like compromised 
women. And if what they say about Epstein is true, wouldn't that 
make them prostitutes? 
As witnesses, they would be weak, while the lawyers on 
Epstein's side were exceptionally strong. 
Alan Dershowitz had represented Claus von Billow, the Brit-
ish socialite who was acquitted of the murder of his wife, Sunny. 
Dershowitz had been on 0. J. Simpson's team when the former 
football star was acquitted of the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole 
Brown Simpson and Nicole's friend Ronald Lyle Goldman. And 
rich as von Billow and Simpson had been, neither one had had 
the resources that Epstein was willing and able to deploy in his 
own defense. 
Neither of them had been intimate friends with his lawyer. 
As far as Reiter was concerned, none of that mattered. Even if 
Epstein thought that the girls he'd molested were eighteen years 
old—even if they had lied to him—it didn't matter under Flor-
ida law. The chief grew worried that in Epstein's case exceptions 
were being made, and he grew even more concerned with each 
unreturned call that he made to the state attorney's office. 
On May 1, the Palm Beach PD asked the state attorney's office 
to issue an arrest warrant for Jeffrey Epstein. 
That same day, Chief Reiter took the extraordinary step of 
writing Barry Krischer a letter all but demanding that he recuse 
himself from the case.

you told us before that you had had some conversations with 
Barry Krischer directly. ...by phone—correct? —prior to this 
letter. 
A: I had conversations in person and by phone.

need to write this letter; is that correct? 
A: Yes.

Q: 
Can you tell us why? 
Well, I felt the handling—and just continued to feel that the 
way the state attorney's office handled this case was extremely 
unusual. I knew that Mr. Krischer was making decisions 
about this case. I felt that his objectivity was lacking, and I 
felt that the appropriate way, after reading the statute that 
governed the assignment of cases to other circuits—I felt 
that his action met the standard. I used some of the words 
from the statute in here. And I attempted to call him, and he 
wouldn't return my phone calls. 
The detective attempted to contact—his contact in the 
state attorney's office, Lanna Belohlavek, however you pro-
nounce that ... and she wouldn't return his calls. So I wrote 
the letter in hope that he would think about his situation and 
realize that his objectivity was insufficient to prosecute the 
case and ask the governor to appoint someone else. And I felt 
like that was necessary for a fair prosecution of our case that 
had been submitted to him. 
Could you tell us, explain to us, why you felt that his objec-
tivity may be lacking in regards to this prosecution ... ? In 
other words, what evidence did you see here, uncover, that 
you felt made it potentially nonobjective? 
A: Well ... when I first told him about the case, and I realized 
that it was a serious case, [that] there were multiple victims, 
[and] that the suspect was very well known, I told him about 
it. And we were—it was in person. I talked to him after a 
meeting that he and I were both involved in. And I had 
known him to be a victim advocate and to protect the rights 
of children. Well, I know that he even wrote a portion of the 
statute that addresses those issues. And when I told him

originally, he said, Let's go for it; this is an adult male in his 
fifties who's had sexual contact with children of the ages of 
the victims. He said this is somebody who we have to stop. 
And whatever we need, he said, in the state attorney's office, 
we have a unit that's equipped to investigate and prosecute 
these kinds of cases. And I didn't have too many facts early 
on when I talked with him, but I knew that there were multi-. 
pie victims and to our detectives they were believable. So 
when time went on and Mr. Epstein became aware of the 
investigation and his lawyers contacted the state attorney's 
office, they told me that. 
And from that point on, and I believe it was Mr. Dershow-
itz initially, the tone and tenor of the discussions of this case 
with Mr. Krischer changed completely. [At] one point he sug-
gested that we write [Epstein] a notice to appear, which 
would be for a misdemeanor. He just completely changed 
from not only our first conversation about this( —when] he 
didn't know the name Jeffrey Epstein— till when he had 
been informed on Mr. Epstein's reputation and his wealth, 
and I just thought that very unusual. 
I feel like I know him or knew him very well, the state 
attorney, and I just felt like he could not objectively make 
decisions about this case: that is why I wrote it.

CHAPTER 46 
Detective Recarey: May 2006 
Chief Reiter's letter to the state attorney had no perceptible 
effect. 
Krischer did not recuse himself from the case. No 
arrest warrant was issued. And on the afternoon of May 3, Detec-
tive Recarey received a telephone call from assistant state attor-
.ney Daliah Weiss, who advised him that she had been taken off 
the Epstein case. 
Weiss had been the perfect person to prosecute Epstein. As a 
member of the special victims unit, she focused on sex crimes 
and crimes against children, prosecuting high-profile cases involv-
ing rape, aggravated child abuse, and neglect. But Epstein had 
added another lawyer, a man named Jack Goldberger, and made 
Goldberger his attorney of record. 
Goldberger was friendly with Barry Krischer— and an asso-
ciate of Goldberger's was married to Daliah Weiss. 
175 
JAMES PATTERSON 
FILTI 
If Epstein's legal team had wanted to remove Weiss from the 
case, this would have been a good way to do it. 
Nine days later, Detective Recarey met with ASA Lanna 
Belohlavek, who told him that her boss, Barry Krischer, had asked 
her again to take the case to the grand jury. Recarey told Belohlavek 
that he had already requested arrest warrants for Epstein, Sarah Kel-
len, and Wendy Dobbs. The Palm Beach PD had finished its investi-
gation months earlier, he said, and had been waiting since then for 
the case to move forward. He asked her once more to issue the war-
rants. Once again Belohlavek declined, saying that the original offer 
her office had made to Epstein's old lawyer had been resubmitted to 
the new lawyer. When Epstein's reply came, she would call. 
While waiting for that call, Recarey received several calls 
from Mary's father, who told him that he was being followed by a 
green Chevrolet Monte Carlo— tailed so aggressively that other 
vehicles were being run off the road. Recarey ran the plates and 
found that the Chevy was registered to one Zachary Bechard of 
Jupiter, Florida. 
Bechard was a licensed private eye. 
A funny thing happened in Palm Beach, says Tim Malloy, who 
was working as a TV newscaster in South Florida at the time. 
This would have been right around the time that Michael 
Reiter sent his letter asking Barry Krischer to recuse himself 
from the case. I didn't even know what Epstein looked like, 
really, at the time. We had pictures taken by the British tabloids, 
where the link to Prince Andrew first broke. But we didn't have 
too many of them. What we did have was a contact in the hangar 
where Epstein kept his 727.

176 
I don't know how much you know about Palm Beach Inter-
national Airport. It's the kind of place that has private hangars, 
valet parking, and waiting lounges that look as chic as anything 
you'll see in Manhattan. It's an airport for the rich, basically. 
Saudi princes, heads of state. Powerful men who value their pri-
vacy. You can bring limousines onto the tarmac. And we found 
out Epstein was very secretive about his dealings there. He didn't 
want anyone to know the tail numbers on his planes. 
But our contact didn't like Epstein. And he was horrified by 
how young the girls around Epstein were. So thanks to him, we 
had the 727's tail number, and thanks to one other source—
someone I won't say too much about here—we had Epstein's 
flight plan for a certain trip he was making. We knew he was 
going to land at the airport. And so our producer climbed into 
the station's traffic helicopter and told the pilot to hover at five 
hundred feet a quarter mile south of the field. 
Our cameraman had a telephoto lens. The idea was to get a 
tight shot, on video, of Epstein deplaning. And for a moment we 
did get the shot: Epstein, with the collar of his cashmere coat 
flipped up over his neck, about to run down the steps into a cart 
that was waiting for him. 
Then he saw our helicopter, with the station's markings. 
I was doing a live voice-over on Epstein's arrival. It was the 
first video anyone had on him up to that point. But Epstein had 
run back onto the plane. Then, during the next commercial 
break, my producer told me through my headpiece: 'Jeffrey 
Epstein wants us to stop taking his picture. In fact, he wants to 
talk to you.' 
The cameraman kept rolling. And eventually Epstein got 
_out, got into a car with tinted windows, and was driven over the 
177 
JAMES PATTERSON 
bridge to his home in Palm Beach. So in a sense we failed to get 
the story. But the fact that Epstein would call a news program 
from his plane and command them to order the program's traffic 
helicopter away—that says something about the man's arro-
gance. And maybe his temper.

Mary: July 2006 
0 n June 29, assistant state attorney Lanna Belohlavek told 
Detective Recarey that despite his protestations, the case 
would be going to a grand jury after all. One had been 
convened for July 19. 
On July 12, Recarey spoke with Mary's stepmother, who said 
that she still hadn't heard from the state attorney's office. This, 
too, was odd, since Recarey knew that Mary would be called 
upon to testify. 
She was back in Palm Beach now, after months of living with 
out-of-state relatives. 
All in all, it had been a very tough year for Mary. 
What has happened to my daughter's life is criminal, her 
father would say. 
Mary had been sent to a school for troubled children. For 
her it was the wrong place at the worst time in her life. She had 
179 
178 
JAMES PATTERSON 
gotten into more fights there, growing depressed and withdrawn 
from her sister and parents. Helplessly, her parents watched her 
spiral out of control. As they neared the end of their rope, they 
sent her out of state. But after the move, Mary had fallen apart 
completely. She used drugs, fell in with a bad crowd, ran away 
from her relatives, and shacked up with a gang of drug dealers. 
When the gang was busted by local police, the dealers blamed 
Mary for snitching and put out the word that they wanted her 
dead. 
We had to move her again, Mary's father explained. We 
finally got her into therapy—she's still seeing the therapist. And 
worst of all, she developed HPV. She's already had to have a seri-
ous operation. 
Mary's troubles didn't end there. On June 28, she was brought 
in front of the grand jury. She hadn't been briefed by the state 
attorney—she hadn't even met the prosecutors—and she had 
no idea what she would be asked. 
Almost immediately, she found that she was being treated 
more like a criminal than like a witness or victim. 
The prosecutor produced a printout of our daughter's 
Myspace page, Mary's father recalls. Mary was stunned. She 
began to cry. The prosecutor accused her of all sort of things; it 
was like she was working for Epstein. 
All this time, we knew that we were being watched. Creepy 
guys. Private investigators from Miami. They would follow us, 
scaring the hell out of my wife and Mary's sister. My car was van-
dalized. It was like living in hell. 
By this point, Epstein's defense dream team included Jack 
Goldberger, Alan Dershowitz, and Gerald Lefcourt. All of them 
had excellent track records. Dershowitz and Lefcourt were two

celebrity lawyer —Ken Starr, the former solicitor general who 
had had Bill Clinton impeached for perjury—would join Epstein's 
team. 
As far as Mary's parents were concerned, their daughter had 
walked into an ambush. Everyone in the courtroom seemed to be 
playing defense on the side of Jeffrey Epstein. And as for the sec-
ond girl—Alison, who claimed that she had been raped—she 
never testified in court at all.

CHAPTER 48 
Michael Reiter: July 2006 
0 n July 28, the grand jury reached a verdict that floored 
the Palm Beach PD. 
The original plea deal that Krischer had offered to 
Epstein had been bad enough. Now the grand jury was recom-
mending that Epstein be charged with just one felony count of 
solicitation of prostitution. 
There was no mention of underage girls. The original 
accusation— four felony counts of unlawful sex acts with minors 
and one felony count of lewd and lascivious molestation—had 
simply evaporated. 
It wasn't enough to send Epstein to prison. 
Epstein was allowed to surrender on a Sunday, when no one 
would know he'd been arraigned. A few hours later, he was 
released on three thousand dollars bail. 
The Palm Beach PD was not even notified.

182 
Once again, Chief Reiter was outraged. So much so that he 
took the extraordinary step of calling the FBI and the federal 
prosecutor's office. 
At the time, the federal prosecutor of the Southern District of 
Florida was a Republican named R. Alexander Acosta. Chief 
Reiter recalls being present at Acosta's swearing-in ceremony 
and remembers Acosta's declaration that one of his goals would 
be the prosecution, to the fullest extent of the law, of anyone 
who takes advantage of the weak—especially perpetrators of 
sex crimes. Disgusted with Krischer's laissez-faire attitude, Reiter 
recalls thinking he'd found his man. 
In Acosta, the chief saw a prosecutor who wouldn't shy away 
from confronting a man with Jeffrey Epstein's resources and 
connections. 
But it turned out that Acosta had worked under Ken Starr at 
Starr's high-powered multinational law firm, Kirkland & Ellis. 
And while Acosta had a sterling resume, which included a stint 
clerking for future Supreme Court justice Samuel Alito, he had 
only argued two cases before a judge. 
At the time, Reiter did not know this. All he knew was that some-
one had to look much more seriously into Jeffrey Epstein's crimes. 
Reiter's actions did not necessarily make him a hero—at least, 
not in every corner of the community he served. 
I had individuals suggest that the department's approach to 
the investigation and my referral of the investigation to the FBI 
was more horsepower than the investigation deserved. And I 
had other individuals suggest that—yeah, the term 'back off'

I had people in the community in Palm Beach who either made 
comments directly to me or to others who relayed them to me that I 
didn't need to take the tack in the investigation that we did, which is 
[to] completely investigate it and then refer it to • the FBI after the 
state case was resolved, Reiter said in the deposition. I had one 
individual who came to see me a couple of times about this. 
According to the chief, the individual in question was a 
prominent Palm Beach politician. 
He said this wasn't necessary; this was a case that was really 
very minor, Reiter recalled. The victims had lifestyles that 
don't make them—shouldn't make them believable to the police 
department. 
I told him that those kinds of suggestions to me were 
improper and he should stop, said Reiter. That he had taken a 
couple of steps down the road toward something that could 
eventually constitute a crime. We talked several times. Early on 
it didn't end favorably. You know, this is an individual [whom] I 
had to interact with in my official capacity and in his official 
capacity as well. 
The Palm Beach politician wasn't the only one to pressure 
the police chief. I received comments from a variety of different 
viewpoints ... in some cases I had people tell me, hey, he's a Palm 
Beacher, why are you investigating a Palm Beacher? Reiter 
would say when deposed. I had people that said it was an unfa-
vorable career move for me to ask the state attorney to remove 
himself from the case and to refer it to the FBI.... I had plenty of 
people that told me that that was a mistake. 
Reiter didn't back off. To have done so would have been a 
betrayal—not only of the victims but also of his vocation and 
the community he had sworn he would serve.

My responsibility was to protect everyone that lives in Palm 
Beach and preserve their constitutional rights and be the police 
department for all, Reiter said. And I think that under the law, 
particularly under the criminal laws, that all people have to, by 
the nature of our system, be treated exactly alike. 
But along with handing the case off to the FBI and the US 
attorney, Reiter took another unusual step. He wrote personal 
letters—on Palm Beach PD letterhead— to the parents of the 
victims in the case. 
He delivered the letters by hand.

1 n the winter of 2013, Scott Blake, a forty-seven-year-old mid-
dle school principal from Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, would 
be sentenced to the minimum mandatory sentence— ten 
years in prison, with ten years of probation on top—for plead-
ing guilty to one charge of soliciting sex with a minor. 
Blake's crime? He sent sexually charged messages to a Boyn-
ton Beach police officer who was pretending to be a fifteen-year-old 
boy. But in a sense, Blake was lucky: he could have been sen-
tenced to life. The case was an interesting example of the kind of 
treatment regular Florida folks could expect just for soliciting sex 
with a minor. But nothing about Jeffrey Epstein was regular--
- 
and the plea deal he managed to strike in 2007 was simply 
extraordinary. 
Epstein had bought himself one of the best defense teams ever 
assembled. His connections and contributions to Democratic 
187

FILT 
causes had made him a player on that side of the political aisle. He 
had a famous Republican, Bill Clinton's nemesis, Ken Starr, work-
ing the other side. And just to make sure they'd covered the bases, 
Epstein's team also recruited Roy Black— the lawyer who'd 
cleared William Kennedy Smith of rape and kept Rush Limbaugh 
out of prison for his alleged illegal drug use—and Jay Lefkowitz, 
a defense attorney who'd worked with US attorney R. Alexander 
Acosta at Ken Starr's law firm. 
And so in September, the US attorney's office reached a for-
mal agreement with Epstein's team: the United States would 
defer federal prosecution in favor of prosecution by the state of 
Florida. 
A non-prosecution agreement (NPA) was drafted; among 
other things, it assured Epstein that he would not be prosecuted 
in the Southern District of Florida for felony offenses involving 
the sexual abuse of underage girls. (By that point, thirty known 
victims had been discovered.) Instead it allowed him to plead 
guilty to state felony offenses for solicitation of prostitution and 
the procurement of minors for prostitution. The NPA established 
a procedure that allowed Epstein's victims to sue him in civil 
court and took the extraordinary step of ensuring that any 
potential co-conspirators of Epstein's would be immune from 
prosecution. 
In consideration of Epstein's agreement to plead guilty and 
to provide compensation in the manner described above, if 
Epstein successfully fulfills all of the terms and conditions of 
this agreement, the United States also agrees that it will not 
institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspira-
tors of Epstein, the agreement stated, mentioning Sarah Kellen 
and Nadia Marcinkova by name.

any compulsory process commanding the disclosure of the agree-
ment, it will provide notice to Epstein before making that 
disclosure. 
Remarkably, despite assurances they'd received from the 
feds, none of the victims was consulted prior to the drafting of 
this NPA. 
If Epstein did not sign the agreement, he faced a fifty-seven-
count indictment and a decade or more in prison. But Epstein's 
team of lawyers had gotten him a deal so sweet it could have rot-
ted all the teeth in South Florida. 
For all his protestations of innocence, there was every reason 
in the world to agree to an NPA. 
On September 24, 2007, Epstein did sign it. 
Once again, none of the victims had been consulted or 
notified.

CHAPTER SO 
Jane Doe: February 2008 
As a result of the non-prosecution agreement, a fifty-three-
count indictment that federal prosecutors had prepared 
against Jeffrey Epstein—one that claimed he'd abused 
dozens of underage women—never was filed. 
But as far as lawyers representing Epstein's victims were con-
cerned, the fact that those victims were not consulted about the 
non-prosecution agreement was inexcusable. The government 
deliberately kept crime victims 'in the dark' so that it could enter 
into a plea arrangement designed to prevent the victims from 
raising any objections, they would argue, in documents filed on 
February 10, 2016. For nine months, the lawyers claimed, from 
the time that the NPA was signed, on September 24, 2007,

moment that Epstein had to plead guilty in court, which he 
finally did June 30, 2008. 
In the interim, according to their lawyers, Epstein's victims 
were only told, This case is currently under investigation. 
A lawsuit that Bradley Edwards, a victims' rights attorney in 
Fort Lauderdale, filed in July of 2008 cited the Crime Victims' 
Rights Act, or CVRA (title 18, section 3771, of the US Code), 
which states that victims of federal crimes have rights, includ-
ing the right to be heard in court, and most particularly, not to 
be precluded from court proceedings, and the right to be treated 
fairly. 
According to him, prosecutors had violated the CVRA rights 
of the victims. Edwards, who said he was working pro bono, 
knew that this suit against the government would not allow for 
monetary recovery of any sort (including lawyers' fees). But he 
also knew that if the government, urged by Jeffrey Epstein, had 
entered into a contract that improperly or illegally violated the 
rights of Epstein's victims, then that contract, by nature, would 
have been improper in and of itself—in which case, the only 
remedy would have been to have the contract invalidated. And 
while it is difficult to know what, exactly, would happen if the 
contract is overturned, one possibility is that the government 
could prosecute Epstein for crimes against his victims, if the 
statute of limitations on those crimes has not expired. 
At the time of this writing, that case is winding its way 
through the courts. It has all the earmarks of a modern-day 
Bleak House........ the Charles Dickens novel about a legal case that 
is so massive and so complex that it drags on forever and drags 
everyone involved into the mire.

JAMES PATTERSON 
* * * 
In the meantime, Epstein began to settle out of court with his 
victims. 
In February of 2008, a Virginia woman who went by the alias 
Jane Doe #2 brought a fifty-million-dollar lawsuit against Epstein. 
At the time of their meeting, she claimed, Epstein was fifty-two 
years old. She was a teenager, and her complaint, which was 
made public, gave the rest of the world an early glimpse of what 
Epstein, and the inner workings of his secret world, looked like 
from a victim's perspective. 
Epstein is a financier and money manager with a secret cli-
entele limited exclusively to billionaires, the lawsuit alleged. 
He is himself a man of tremendous wealth, power and influ-
ence. He maintains his principal home in New York and also 
owns residences in New Mexico, St. Thomas and Palm Beach, 
FL. The allegations herein concern Epstein's conduct while at his 
lavish estate in Palm Beach. The complaint continued: 
Upon information and belief, Epstein has a sexual preference 
and obsession for underage minor girls. He engaged in a plan 
and scheme in which he gained access to primarily economi-
cally disadvantaged minor girls in his home, sexually 
assaulted these girls, and then gave them money. In or about 
2004-2005, Jane Doe, then approximately 16 years old, fell 
into Epstein's trap and became one of his victims. 
Upon information and belief, Jeffrey Epstein carried out 
his schemes and assaulted girls in Florida, New York, and on 
his private Island, known as Little St. James, in St. Thomas. 
Epstein's scheme involved the use of young girls to recruit 
192

the use of young girls to recruit 
192 
underage girls. (Upon information and belief, the young girl 
who brought Jane Doe to Epstein was herself a minor victim 
of Epstein, and will therefore not be named in this Com-
plaint.) Under Epstein's plan, underage girls were recruited 
ostensibly to give a wealthy man a massage for monetary 
compensation in his Palm Beach mansion. The recruiter 
would be contacted when Epstein was planning to be at his 
Palm Beach residence or soon after he had arrived there. 
Epstein or someone on his behalf would direct the recruiter 
to bring one or more underage girls to the residence. The 
recruiter, upon information and belief, generally sought out 
economically disadvantaged underaged girls from western 
Palm Beach County who would be enticed by the money 
being offered—generally $200 to $300 per massage 
session—and who were perceived as less likely to complain 
to authorities or have credibility if allegations of improper 
conduct were made. This was an important element of 
Epstein's plan. 
Epstein's plan reflected a particular pattern and method. 
Upon arrival at Epstein's mansion, the underaged victim 
would be introduced to Sarah Kellen, Epstein's assistant, who 
gathered the girl's personal information, including her name 
and telephone number. Ms. Kellen would then bring the girl 
up a flight of stairs to a bedroom that contained a massage 
table in addition to other furnishings. There were photo-
graphs of nude women lining the stairway hall and in the 
bedroom. The girl would then find herself alone in the room 
with Epstein, who would be wearing only a towel. He would 
then remove his towel and lie naked on the massage table, 
and direct the girl to remove her clothes. Epstein would then 
193 
JAMES PATTERSON 
perform one or more lewd, lascivious and sexual acts, 
including masturbation and touching the girl's vagina. 
Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Jane Doe 
was recruited to give Epstein a massage for monetary com-
pensation. Jane was brought to Epstein's mansion in Palm 
Beach. Once at the mansion, Jane was introduced to Sarah 
Kellen, who led her up the flight of stairs to the room with the 
massage table. In this room, Epstein told Jane to take off her 
clothes and give him a massage. Jane kept her panties and 
bra on and complied with Epstein's instructions. Epstein 
wore only a towel around his waste [sic]. After a short period 
of time, Epstein removed the towel and rolled over exposing 
his penis. Epstein began to masturbate and he sexually 
assaulted Jane. 
• After Epstein had completed the assault, Jane was then 
able to get dressed, leave the room and go back down the 
stairs. Jane was paid $200 by Epstein. The young girl who 
recruited Jane was paid $100 by Epstein for bringing Jane to 
him. 
As a result of this encounter with Epstein, Jane experi-
enced confusion, shame, humiliation and embarrassment, and 
has suffered severe psychological and emotional injuries.

CHAPTER SI 
Jeffrey Epstein: June 30, 2008 
0 n June 30, 2008, more than three years after the start of 
Officer Pagan's investigation into his dealings with under-
age girls, Jeffrey Epstein reported to the Palm Beach 
County jail. 
A few days earlier, Epstein had taken a phone call from the 
New York Times. At the time, he'd been working, or vacationing 
(the line having long since blurred), at his compound on Little 
Saint Jeff's. 
I respect the legal process, Epstein had said. I will abide 
by this. 
He'd spent years fighting the charges—fighting the state, 
then the federal government, in an effort to avoid a sentence that 
would have seen him emerge from prison an old man. But the 
battle had aged him. Mellowed him, even. Months earlier, he had 
all but boasted to a journalist from New York magazine. 
195 
JAMES PATTERSON 
It's the Icarus story, someone who flies too close to the sun, 
that journalist said in reference to the agony of Epstein's legal 
ordeal. 
Did Icarus like massages? Epstein responded. 
But after Epstein's indictment, there were no more boasts. 
For the most part, he kept silent in public and retreated into his 
Eyes Wide Shut world. And when the New York Times did manage 
to get him to speak on the record, he spoke like a chastened man. 
Sitting on his patio down on Little St. James, Epstein likened 
himself to the shipwrecked Gulliver after he washes ashore on 
Lilliput. 
Gulliver's playfulness had unintended consequences, he said. 
On the eve of his departure, he had a few more things to say: 
That is what happens with wealth. There are unexpected 
burdens as well as benefits.... 
Your body can be confined, but not your mind.... 
I am not blameless.... 
Outside of the agreement he'd signed with the prosecutor's 
office, this was the closest Epstein had come to admitting his 
guilt. But strange details were sprinkled throughout the story. 
He had formed a board of directors of friends who would coun-
sel him on his behavior. And, seemingly for the first time, he'd 
hired a full-time masseur—a man. 
Readers of the New York Times might have wondered: Epstein 
was going to jail for eighteen months. What need would he have 
for a full-time masseur? 
The story's last line hinted at the answer: in preparation for 
incarceration, Epstein had set up an e-mail alert. 
From then on, his automatic reply would read On vacation.

CHAPTER 52 
Jeffrey Epstein: June 30, 2008 
The Palm Beach County Main Detention Center is on the 
west side of Lake Worth Lagoon, which separates West 
Palm Beach from the island of Palm Beach. Epstein's 
home on El Brillo Way is five miles to the east. Mary's high 
school is several miles to the west. 
It's fitting, somehow, that this jail—which is the jail Epstein 
ends up in, after turning himself in to the local sheriff—lies in 
between the two points. 
The detention center's inmates, their families, and their law-
yers call it the Gun Club, a reference not only to the jail's address, 
on Gun Club Road, but also to its population of hustlers, bur-
glars, drug dealers, rapists, and murderers. There's the occa-
sional hooker as well. And, from time to time, Haitian refugees 
are lodged there. 
There are three thousand inmates in all. 
199 
JAMES PATTERSON 
Some wait a year before making their way to the courthouse, 
their date with the public defender, and an appearance before 
the judge. Some get out much sooner, if only they can make bail. 
But there's no bail without money—or at least collateral—and, 
of course, being without money is often what lands people in jail 
in the first place. 
Jeffrey Epstein could have posted bail for every single inmate 
in the Gun Club. 
But that's just one of the ways in which Epstein is unlike his 
fellow inmates. He's an admitted pedophile now. Even a famous one. 
And, famously, pedophiles tend to fare poorly in jail. 
Luckily for Epstein, Ric Bradshaw, the sheriff in charge of 
local jails, transfers Epstein to the infirmary, where he spends 
exactly one night before being transferred seven miles up the 
road to a much smaller, safer location: the Palm Beach County 
Central Detention Center—or, as it's known, the Stockade. 
It's not somewhere we'd put a serial killer, Ric Bradshaw says. 
Most of the residents here are addicts who take part in drug 
education programs, prostitutes, petty criminals, and drunks. 
It's a far safer place for Epstein to be, and, unlike other inmates 
(except, of course, those being held in solitary), he'll end up with 
his own cell, even his own wing, which he has to himself. 
Epstein's allowed to pay for a security guard, who sits outside the 
cell and keeps watch. And he's allowed any number of visitors. 
For a convicted felon, it's an extraordinary benefits package. 
But according to Sheriff Bradshaw, who also oversees the Stock-
ade, Epstein is incredulous over the treatment he is receiving. 
He was astonished that he had to go to prison at all, Brad-
shaw remembers. 
Let's just say he didn't think he belonged there.

Sheriff Ric Bradshaw: June 2015 
ur job, says Ric Bradshaw, was to make sure nobody 
killed him. 
Sheriff Bradshaw could have stepped off the set of a 
Western. Imposingly tall, with his cowboy hat, Kurt Russell 
mustache, and slow, southern drawl, he looks exactly like an 
old-school law officer—the kind you once would have found 
patrolling the streets of Tombstone, Deadwood, or Dodge City. 
He's been a lawman for forty-four years, eleven of which have 
been spent as the head of the county's jails. As a rule, he doesn't 
talk to the media, and today, as he talks about Jeffrey Epstein, 
he's clearly uncomfortable, fidgety, and ill disposed. 
But here in his wood-paneled office on the first floor of the 
Gun Club, Bradshaw remembers Epstein quite well. 
We have a thousand sexual predators in the county, he 
says. When he arrived here, he was one of them. He definitely

fit the category we have to ensure the general population is not 
going to take their anger out on. 
Although he understands that Epstein is a sex offender 
and has a sense of the scope of his alleged crimes, Bradshaw's 
also aware that the actual conviction was for a low-level felony. 
At the request of Epstein's attorneys—a request that is con-
firmed by a court order—Epstein is quickly granted work 
release. 
What it means in practice is that six days a week, for up to 
sixteen—sixteen! —hours each day, Epstein is allowed to leave 
the Stockade to be driven by a designated driver in a car ear-
marked especially for him to any one of three places: his lawyer 
Jack Goldberger's office in downtown West Palm Beach, the 
Palm Beach office of a science foundation that he's established, 
and his house on El Brillo Way. 
Despite the ankle bracelet he wears, it could be argued that 
as a fabulously rich prisoner with two of his own jets parked 
nearby, at the Palm Beach International Airport, Epstein might 
have posed a flight risk. 
Instead, every day of the week save one, he's allowed to go to 
his lawyer's, to go to his office, or simply to go home. 
Did the deputy in charge of Epstein go to the house on El 
Brillo Way? 
Ric Bradshaw considers the question. 
Yes, he says, he did. 
Did the deputy go inside the house? 
Yes, he did. 
If so, the deputy might have encountered Nadia Marcinkova, 
who was staying on El Brillo Way at the time. He may also have

ccording to Sheriff Ric Bradshaw, the treatment Jeffrey 
Epstein received in the Stockade was not preferential. By 
some measures, he isn't wrong. 
In 2010, millionaire polo mogul John Goodman killed a 
young man while driving drunk. He was convicted but was 
allowed to spend two years under house arrest while his appeal 
was being tried. 
Like Epstein, Goodman was allowed visitors. But Goodman's 
visitor list was nothing like Jeffrey Epstein's. 
Nadia Marcinkova is said to have visited Epstein in jail more 
than seventy times. 
Epstein's assistant Sarah Kellen also visited Epstein in the 
Stockade. 
A Russian mixed martial artist named Igor Houdini Zinoviev was another visitor, as was a disbarred lawyer and financial

Sheriff Bradshaw wants to be clear: none of these visits was 
conjugal. 
But even US attorney Acosta, who negotiated Epstein's unusual 
agreement with the government, would say that Epstein's arrange-
ment was highly irregular. 
Epstein appears to have received highly unusual treatment 
while in jail, Acosta would say in a letter addressed to the gen-
eral public. Although the terms of confinement in a state prison 
are a matter appropriately left to the state of Florida and not fed-
eral authorities, without doubt, the treatment that he received 
while in state custody undermined the purpose of a jail sentence. 
And, of course, Epstein's stay at the Stockade was subsidized 
by taxpayers.

CHAPTER 55 
R. Alexander Acosta's letter to the general public, 
March 20, 2011 
To whom it may concern: 
I served as U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida 
from 2005 through 2009. Over the past weeks, I have read 
much regarding Mr. Jeffrey Epstein. Some appears true, 
some appears distorted. I thought it appropriate to provide 
some background, with two caveats: (i) under Justice Depart-
ment guidelines, I cannot discuss privileged internal com-
munications among department attorneys and (ii) I no longer 
have access to the original documents, and as the matter is 
now nearly 4 years old, the precision of memory is reduced. 
The Epstein matter was originally presented to the 
Palm Beach County State Attorney. Palm Beach Police

was originally presented to the 
te Attorney. Palm Beach Police 
Ilawfully hired underage high 
206 
FILTHY RICH 
school females to provide him sexually lewd and erotic 
massages. Police sought felony charges that would have 
resulted in a term of imprisonment. According to press 
reports, however, in 2006 the State Attorney, in part due 
to concerns regarding the quality of the evidence, agreed 
to charge Epstein only with one count of aggravated 
assault with no intent to commit a felony. That charge 
would have resulted in no jail time, no requirement to 
register as a sexual offender and no restitution for the 
underage victims. 
Local police were dissatisfied with the State Attor-
ney's conclusions, and requested a federal investigation. 
Federal authorities received the State's evidence and 
engaged in additional investigation. Prosecutors weighed 
the quality of the evidence and the likelihood for success 
at trial. With a federal case, there were two additional 
considerations. First, a federal criminal prosecution 
requires that the crime be more than local; it must have 
an interstate nexus. Second, as the matter was initially 
charged by the state, the federal responsibility is, to some 
extent, to back-stop state authorities to ensure that there 
is no miscarriage of justice, and not to also prosecute fed-
erally that which has already been charged at the state 
level. 
After considering the quality of the evidence and the 
additional considerations, prosecutors concluded that 
the state charge was insufficient. In early summer 2007, 
the prosecutors and agents in this case met with 
Mr. Epstein's attorney, Roy Black. Mr. Black is perhaps 
best known for his successful defense of William 
207 
JAMES PATTERSON 
Fij 
Kennedy Smith. The prosecutors presented Epstein a 
choice: plead to more serious state felony charges (that 
would result in 2 years' imprisonment, registration as a 
sexual offender, and restitution for the victims) or else 
prepare for a federal felony trial. 
What followed was a year-long assault on the prose-
cution and the prosecutors. I use the word assault inten-
tionally, as the defense in this case was more aggressive 
than any which I, or the prosecutors in my office, had 
previously encountered. Mr. Epstein hired an army of 
legal superstars: Harvard Professor Alan Dershowitz, for-
mer Judge and then Pepperdine Law Dean Kenneth Starr, 
former Deputy Assistant to the President and then Kirk-
land & Ellis Partner Jay Lefkowitz, and several others, 
including prosecutors who had formerly worked in the 
U.S. Attorney's Office and in the Child Exploitation and 
Obscenity Section of the Justice Department. Defense 
attorneys next requested a meeting with me to challenge 
the prosecution and the terms previously presented by 
the prosecutors in their meeting with Mr. Black. The 
prosecution team and I met with defense counsel in Fall 
2007, and I reaffirmed the office's position: two years, 
registration and restitution, or trial. 
Over the next several months, the defense team pre-
sented argument after argument claiming that felony 
criminal proceedings against Epstein were unsupported 
by the evidence and lacked a basis in law, and that the 
office's insistence on jail-time was motivated by a zeal to 
overcharge a man merely because he is wealthy. They 
bolstered their arguments with legal opinions from

well-known legal experts. One member of the defense 
team warned me that the office's excess zeal in forcing a 
good man to serve time in jail might be the subject of a 
book if we continued to proceed with the matter. My 
office systematically considered and rejected each argu-
ment, and when we did, my office's decisions were 
appealed to Washington. As to the warning, I ignored it. 
The defense strategy was not limited to legal issues. 
Defense counsel investigated individual prosecutors and 
their families, looking for personal peccadilloes that may 
provide a basis for disqualification. Disqualifying a pros-
ecutor is an effective (though rarely used) strategy, as 
eliminating the individuals most familiar with the facts 
and thus most qualified to take a case to trial harms like-
lihood for success. Defense counsel tried to disqualify at 
least two prosecutors. I carefully reviewed, and then 
rejected, these arguments. 
Despite the army of attorneys, the office held firm to 
the terms first presented to Mr. Black in the original 
meeting. On June 30, 2008, after yet another last minute 
appeal to Washington D.C. was rejected, Epstein pled 
guilty in state court. He was to serve 18 months impris-
onment, register as a sexual offender for life, and provide 
restitution to the victims. 
Some may feel that the prosecution should have been 
tougher. Evidence that has come to light since 2007 may 
encourage that view. Many victims have since spoken 
out, filing detailed statements in civil cases seeking dam-
ages. Physical evidence has since been discovered. Had 
these additional statements and evidence been known, 
209 
JAMES PATTERSON 
the outcome may have been different. But they were not 
known to us at the time. 
A prosecution decision must be based on admissible 
facts known at the time. In cases of this type, those are 
unusually difficult because victims are frightened and 
often decline to testify or if they do speak, they give con-
tradictory statements. Our judgment in this case, based 
on the evidence known at the time, was that it was better 
to have a billionaire serve time in jail, register as a sex 
offender, and pay his victims restitution than risk a trial 
with a reduced likelihood of success. I supported that 
judgment then, and based on the state law as it then stood 
and the evidence known at the time, I would support that 
judgment again. 
Epstein's treatment, while in state custody, likewise 
may encourage the view that the office should have been 
tougher. Although the terms of confinement in a state 
prison are a matter appropriately left to the State of Flor-
ida, and not federal authorities, without doubt, the treat-
ment that he received while in state custody undermined 
the purpose of a jail sentence. 
Some may also believe that the prosecution should 
have been tougher in retaliation for the defense's tactics. 
The defense, arguably, often failed to negotiate in good 
faith. They would obtain concessions as part of a negotia-
tion and agree to proceed, only to change their minds, 
and appeal the office's position to Washington. The inves-
tigations into the family lives of individual prosecutors 
were, in my opinion, uncalled for, as were the accusations 
of bias and/or misconduct against individual prosecutors.

At times, some prosecutors felt that we should just go to 
trial, and at times I felt that frustration myself. What was 
right in the first meeting, however, remained right irre-
spective of defense tactics. Individuals have a constitu-
tional right to a defense. The aggressive exercise of that 
right should not be punished, nor should a defense coun-
sel's exercise of their right to appeal a U.S Attorney to 
Washington D.C. Prosecutors must be careful not to allow 
frustration and anger with defense counsel to influence 
their judgment. 
After the plea, I recall receiving several phone calls. 
One was from the FBI Special Agent-In-Charge. He called 
to offer congratulations. He had been at many of the 
meetings regarding this case. He was aware of the tactics 
of the defense, and he called to praise our prosecutors for 
holding firm against the likes of Messrs. Black, Dershow-
itz, Lefkowitz and Starr. It was a proud moment. I also 
received calls or communications from Messrs. Dershow-
itz, Lefkowitz and Starr. I had known all three individu-
als previously, from my time in law school and at 
Kirkland & Ellis in the mid 90s. They all sought to make 
peace. I agreed to talk and meet with each of them after 
Epstein pled guilty, as I think it important that prosecu-
tors battle defense attorneys in a case and then move on. I 
have tried, yet I confess that this has been difficult to do 
fully in this case. 
The bottom line is this: Mr. Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire, 
served time in jail and is now a registered sexual offender. 
He has been required to pay his victims restitution, though 
restitution clearly cannot compensate for the crime. And

CHAPTER 56 
Jeffrey Epstein: July 2009 
Jeffrey Epstein walks out of the Stockade on July 21, 2009, 
having served less than thirteen months of his eighteen-month 
sentence. One of the concessions his lawyers have gotten 
while working out his plea-deal guarantees is that the media not 
be alerted to the time and day of his departure. 
But from now on, Epstein, who is fifty-six, will carry the 
mark of a level 3 sex offender—level 1 being the lowest, and 
level 3 indicating the highest possible risk of a future criminal 
act of a sexual nature. Wherever he goes, he will be forced to reg-
ister as such. 
Every ninety days, Epstein will have to check in with the 
authorities. Every year, the New York City Police Department 
will take his mug shot. And for a full year, Epstein will be under 
house arrest in Palm Beach. 
This last prohibition doesn't stop him from flying, with court 
215 
JAMES PATTERSON 
approval, on his own planes to New York and to Little Saint Jeff's, 
where the locals have taken to referring to Epstein's 727 as the 
Lolita Express. 
There are other restrictions, of course, that Epstein is sup-
posed to abide by. He has to provide the state of Florida with a 
list of all the motor vehicles, boats, and airplanes he owns. The 
full list includes two Escalades, six Suburbans, two Ford F-150s, 
two Harley-Davidsons, a Land Rover, a Hummer H2, a thirty-
four-foot JVC boat, and a thirty-five-foot Donzi powerboat. 
Three of his five planes turn out to be registered to a com-
pany called Air Ghislaine, Inc. 
As a registered sex offender, Epstein is legally obliged to 
undergo psychiatric treatment. This is a restriction he'll get 
around by having his own psychologist submit a report to law 
enforcement officers. 
Epstein is also prohibited from accessing pornography on 
the Internet and using social networking for sexual purposes. 
For Jeffrey Epstein, there will be no Bangbros, Tinder, or 
Swingles. com. 
There will be lawsuits. 
Six weeks before probation ends, he settles with seven women 
who sue him in civil court. But Epstein can easily afford the set-
tlement payments. He won't be going back to jail, and in regard 
to further prosecution for any criminal actions, his troubles are 
behind him. 
Not everyone who's spent time in his company will be so 
lucky.

Alfredo Rodriguez: August 2009 
Epstein's houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez, also ends up with a 
prison sentence. 
In a sworn statement, Rodriguez talks about Epstein's 
maid, Lupita, who had complained to him about having to clean 
up after Epstein's massages. Lupita, who was a devout Catho-
lic, had cried as she described the stained towel and sex toys. 
Rodriguez was fired by Epstein, he says, when he called 911 
after seeing a strange car—a beater —in Epstein's driveway. 
As it turned out, the car had belonged to one of Epstein's 
masseuses. 
On his way out of the house on El Brillo Way, he took some 
of Epstein's papers, which he failed to produce when questioned 
by Chief Reiter's investigators. 
For years, Rodriguez tried and failed to find work as a house 
nager. No one wanted to hire someone who'd worked for 
217 
JAMES PATTERSON 
Jeffrey Epstein. Finally, desperately, he tried to sell the informa-
tion he'd stolen. 
The papers named underage girls and the places where 
Epstein had taken them. The list included locations in Califor-
nia, Paris, New Mexico, New York, and Michigan. The papers 
also included the names, addresses, and phone numbers of 
famous individuals—Henry Kissinger, Mick Jagger, Dustin Hoff-
man, Ralph Fiennes, David Koch, Ted Kennedy, Donald Trump, 
Bill Richardson, Bill Clinton, and former Israeli prime minister 
Ehud Barak among them. 
This was intriguing, if not at all damning. Epstein made a 
habit of collecting such information for future use. But informa-
tion pertaining to the girls would have bolstered the state's case 
against Jeffrey Epstein, and by withholding it from the Palm 
Beach PD and the FBI, Rodriguez had committed a crime. 
In his defense, Rodriguez would say that the papers were an 
insurance policy. Without them, he believed, Epstein would 
have made him disappear. 
But now Rodriguez needed the money. And so a few weeks 
after Epstein's release from the Stockade, he approached a lawyer 
who was representing some of Epstein's masseuses. He had the 
holy grail, he insisted. A• golden nugget. The names of hun-
dreds of girls, he said, who had been abused by Epstein. 
The lawyer told Rodriguez in no uncertain terms that he was 
obliged to turn whatever he had over to the authorities. By 
demanding money for the information, Rodriguez was commit-
ting another crime. 
According to a sworn statement by Christina Pryor, a special. 
agent with the FBI, Rodriguez persisted that he would only turn 
over the information in his possession in exchange for $50,000.

* * * 
Two months later, on October 28, the lawyer called Rodriguez, 
who insisted once more on being paid for the information. The 
lawyer told him that an associate would be in touch. 
What the lawyer knew and Rodriguez did not know was that 
the associate in question was an undercover employee (UCE) of 
the FBI. A few days later, on November 2, the UCE calls Rodri-
guez and sets up a meeting, which takes place the following day. 
During the meeting, Rodriguez produced a small bound 
book and several sheets of legal pad paper containing handwrit-
ten notes, Special Agent Pryor would say in her statement. She 
continues: 
Rodriguez explained that he had taken the bound book from 
his former employer's residence while employed there in 
2004 to 2005 and that the book had been created by persons 
working for his former employer. Rodriguez discussed in 
detail the information within the book and identified import-
ant information to the UCE. In addition, Rodriguez admitted 
he had previously lied to the FBI. Rodriguez asked the UCE 
about the $50,000, took possession of the money, and began 
counting it. 
Rodriguez was then detained for Obstruction of Official 
Proceedings, Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 1512(c), and ques-
tioned. After Miranda warnings were administered by agents, 
Rodriguez waived his rights and signed a written waiver of 
those rights. Rodriguez admitted that he had the documents 
and book in his possession and had never turned them over 
to local law enforcement or the FBI. In addition, Rodriguez 
219 
JAMES PATTERSON 
advised he had witnessed nude girls whom he believed were 
underage at the pool area of his former employer's home, 
knew that his former employer was engaging in sexual con-
tact with underage girls, and had viewed pornographic 
images of underage girls on computers in his employer's 
home. Rodriguez was then released from custody for further 
investigation. 
The items that Rodriguez had attempted to sell to the 
UCE for $50,000.00 were reviewed by an agent familiar with 
the underlying criminal investigation. As Rodriguez had 
described, the items contained information material to the 
underlying investigation that would have been extremely use-
ful in investigatang] and prosecuting the case, including the 
names and contact information of material witnesses and 
additional victims. Had those items been produced in 
response to the inquiries of the state law enforcement officers 
or the FBI Special Agents, their contents would have been 
presented to the federal grand jury. 
Following his release, Alfredo Rodriguez was arrested again. 
He appeared in court on June 18, 2010, facing charges of cor-
ruptly concealing records and documents. Dressed in a blue 
jumpsuit and shackles, he apologized for his crimes and asked 
the court to be merciful. 
He received a sentence of eighteen months. 
It was the same punishment that Jeffrey Epstein had gotten 
for his crimes. But unlike Epstein, Alfredo Rodriguez served his 
time in a federal prison and did not ask for, or receive, permis-
sion to go on work release.

1001 Reasons to Pay No Attention

Objections have been raised to these arguments, primarily by researchers within the AI
community. The objections reflect a natural defensive reaction, coupled perhaps with a
lack of imagination about what a superintelligent machine could do. None hold water on
closer examination. Here are some of the more common ones:

risk of losing to DeepBlue or AlphaGo is negligible—all one has to do is make
the right moves.

e Human-level or superhuman AI is impossible This is an unusual claim for AI
researchers to make, given that, from Turing onward, they have been fending off
such claims from philosophers and mathematicians. The claim, which is backed
by no evidence, appears to concede that if superintelligent AI were possible, it
would be a significant risk. It’s as if a bus driver, with all of humanity as
passengers, said, “Yes, I am driving toward a cliff—in fact, I’m pressing the pedal
to the metal! But trust me, we’ll run out of gas before we get there!” The claim
represents a foolhardy bet against human ingenuity. We have made such bets
before and lost. On September 11, 1933, renowned physicist Ernest Rutherford
stated, with utter confidence, “Anyone who expects a source of power from the
transformation of these atoms is talking moonshine.” On September 12, 1933,
Leo Szilard invented the neutron-induced nuclear chain reaction. A few years
later he demonstrated such a reaction in his laboratory at Columbia University.
As he recalled in a memoir: “We switched everything off and went home. That
night, there was very little doubt in my mind that the world was headed for grief.”

e It’s too soon to worry about it. The right time to worry about a potentially serious
problem for humanity depends not just on when the problem will occur but also
on how much time is needed to devise and implement a solution that avoids the
risk. For example, if we were to detect a large asteroid predicted to collide with
the Earth in 2067, would we say, “It’s too soon to worry”? And if we consider
the global catastrophic risks from climate change predicted to occur later in this
century, is it too soon to take action to prevent them? On the contrary, it may be
too late. The relevant timescale for human-level AI is less predictable, but, like
nuclear fission, it might arrive considerably sooner than expected. One variation
on this argument is Andrew Ng’s statement that it’s “like worrying about
overpopulation on Mars.” This appeals to a convenient analogy: Not only is the

will exist and act solely within computer networks. .. . It is always possible to turn off a computer network,
even if painful.” https:/Avww.1ecode.net/2015/3/2/11559576/.

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026134.txt,"﻿Kiev, 12 June 2017
Dear George,
Re: Ukrainian Banking Opportunity
Further to our discussion, I am sending a brief presentation on the prospect of
establishing a banking footprint in Ukraine through the acquisition of a bank.
Currently the central bank in Ukraine, the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) is not
keen to issue new banking licenses but urge prospective investors to acquire an
existing license.
The main drivers for my positive stance on investing in the banking sector in
Ukraine are:
▪ the improving economy following the IMF program with demanding but
required structural reforms, with real GDP growth expected to reach 4% in
2020;
▪ the improving political conditions in terms of the conflict with Russia with
the support of NATO;
▪ the recent developments in the EU-Ukraine relationship with the abolition of
visa and the prospect of concluding the Association Agreement in July;
▪ the investment and commitments from supranational institutions so far
(EBRD: c. US$6 billion being the third largest exposure of the bank after
Turkey and Russia, World Bank: c. US$5 billion);
▪ the significant restructuring efforts in ensuring a healthier banking sector
following AQR that resulted to the nationalization of the biggest bank
Privatbank and the closing of half of the banks (over 90 banks), and the
preparation of the state sector banks (52% share of assets) for privatization
in the next 2 to 3 years; and
▪ the current landscape of the banking sector that allows organic expansion
because of very few notable foreign banks that have the ability to develop
business or, even more, to exploit the potential for consolidating the banking
sector where government owns 52% in a market with increasing trend in
loans and deposits and high commission income.
1
!
Economy
Following a severe crisis in 2014-15, the economy is growing again-by 2.3 percent
in 2016-and the flexible exchange rate and tight fiscal and monetary policies have
greatly reduced internal and external imbalances. GDP, which declined from its
peak of US$183 billion in 2013 to US$90 billion in 2015, is now recovering at a
growth above 2% and is expected to grow at 3.2% in 2018. Growth is projected at
3.5%-4% in the medium term (IMF).
The current account deficit fell sharply, from over 9% of GDP in 2013 to 3.6% of
GDP in 2016 and reserves-while still low-have more than doubled to US$17.6
billion (end of 2017 target at US$21.3 billion). The overall fiscal deficit-including
the energy sector’s quasi-fiscal losses, which had increased to 10 percent of GDP
in 2014, declined to 2.3% of GDP in 2016, supported by strong spending control
and the decision to raise energy tariffs to market levels.
Inflation has fallen steadily from its peak of 61% in April 2015 to 12.4% by end-
2016, well within the target range of the NBU. It is projected to reach 9% in 2017
and 5% in the medium term.
Ukraine has entered into a 4-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with IMF in
March 2015 for US$17.5 billion. Following the third review by IMF the fourth
tranche of US$1 billion was approved which would bring total disbursements
under the arrangement to about US$8.38 billion. The EFF aims to put the economy
on the path to recovery, restore external sustainability, strengthen public finances,
maintain financial stability, and support economic growth by advancing structural
and governance reforms, while protecting the most vulnerable.
The Ukrainian administration showed commitment to reforms by nationalising the
largest private bank, Privatbank, and liquidating over 100 banks within 3 years.
2
Also, collection of taxes has increased significantly (34% increase in 2 years) and
spending has been contained while at the same time energy/utility tariffs have
increased dramatically at full cost recovery basis.
The main reforms agreed with the IMF include the privatisation of large state
enterprises such as the Odessa Portside Plant and Centrenergo, the lifting of the
embargo on the sale of agricultural land to foreigners, the raising of the pension
age, the restructuring of the health system and the increase in efforts combating
corruption.
Most of these reforms, although not expected to be completed in the immediate
term, they are expected to be implemented in a gradual process.
For example, land reform may be initiated partially by privatising state agricultural
land (1 billion hectares). 25% of world’s black-earth soil is in Ukraine, considered
the most fertile and productive agricultural land. Over 70% of Ukraine is
agricultural land valued at US$100 billion. Ukraine is the biggest exporter in
sunflower oil globally, 2 nd in world grain exporter after the US and 3 rd in corn
exports globally. The land reform is expected to elevate the country’s performance
with significant FDIs from international investors.
On the pension front, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the draft of the pension
reform-IMF and World Bank already supported the draft- and will discuss it at the
National Reform Council, to be then submitted to the Rada (parliament). The
pension reform was long overdue, given that the Pension Fund deficit reached
UAH 140 billion or 6.3% of GDP in 2016. Pension reform is considered to be one
of the most socially sensitive reforms the government is planning to implement
under the current IMF Extended Arrangement. However, it seems that the
government has managed to avoid the most unpopular measure of increasing the
statutory pension age while increasing the effective pension age. The proposed
reform will assist in reducing the deficit starting from mid-2018.
The implementation of the reforms should assist the government in managing the
debt profile of the country presented below. While there is no imminent need for
IMF disbursements, 2019 (presidential and parliamentary) elections coincide with
a US$7 billion peak of public sector FX needs, while US$12 billion is due in total
in 2017-19. The authorities need to secure sufficient FX funding in advance, while
the alternative funding sources are limited. The FX reserves increased to US$17
billion, but cover 3.8 months of imports only.
As already described in the recent IMF review, Ukraine is expected to re-access the
international capital market as early as the second part of 2017 supported by the
improved debt profile resulting from the recent debt operation (perimeter of the
debt operation included sovereign and sovereign guaranteed Eurobonds, City of
Kyiv Eurobonds, Guaranteed Commercial Loans and SOE debt) for a total nominal
3
!
value of USD 19.3 billion). The debt profile has become more favorable with the
increase of the share of official debt, a decline in the foreign currency debt share
and the very low share of short term debt. This should effectively make easier the
refinancing of the debt in 2019 and 2020.
The synthesis of the current parliament allows the government to push for reforms
in 2017 and early 2018 before they turn to populist measures just before elections.
Leading the country off-track with the IMF program will surely limit even further
the funding resources of the country.
Politics
EU has verified its support by (i) lifting its visa requirements to Ukrainian citizens
for traveling, a long awaited move that embeds symbolism of support and (ii)
following the vote by the Dutch parliament to support Ukraine’s Association
Agreement, it is expected that the ratification of the Association Agreement,
including the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area component will be ratified
in the Ukraine-EU Summit on July 13.
NATO has also shown strong support to Ukraine by providing various forms of
assistance through advice and training to strengthen its defence by building
stronger security structures. The Ukrainian defence industry may also get
permission to participate in tenders for the supply of goods and services for NATO.
4
Last week Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin stated that he expects an
expanded partnership between Ukraine and NATO will lead Ukraine to a
membership in the Alliance following a path similar to that of Montenegro.
With regard to the United States, for now President Trump’s ambiguous
positioning in Russian affairs seems to have little impact on the U.S.
Administration's Ukraine policy. The Administration is expected to continue its
support for the actions of NATO, the IMF and Secretary of State Tillerson has
reaffirmed in April 2017 that the U.S. will not lift sanctions against Russia as long
President Putin does not hand Crimea back to Kiev.
In internal politics, we would expect Mr Poroshenko, the President of Ukraine, to
sign the Association Agreement, thus improving his diminishing ratings and to
win the presidential elections in 2019. In my opinion, Mr Poroshenko is also
delaying the elections in the conflict zone of Donbass, a major requirement
featured in the Minsk Agreement, in order to avoid the negation of his good
performance on the European prospect, and then, assessing the Russian conflict
situation at that point in time, to progress with the Minsk Agreement and
effectively resolve a major part of the conflict. I do not think that Crimea will ever
find its way back to Ukraine but if all other matters are resolved, a financial
settlement would be considered.
Therefore the status of “frozen conflict” in the Donbass area would remain in the
short to medium term but the economy of Ukraine has been operating for a number
of years now without the Donbass and the annexed to Russia Crimea. All growth
estimates published by various international institutes incorporate similar
assumptions.
Banking Sector
In the past 3 years there has been a clean-up by the National bank of Ukraine
(NBU) with the support of IMF mainly as well as of EBRD and IFC. The number
of banks has been reduced from 192 to 92 and there are still banks that will be
liquidated. The most drastic action was the nationalisation of Privatbank, the
biggest bank in the country (market share 17.7% by assets, 36% of deposits of
physical persons), owned by an oligarch that was posing a systemic risk to the
country’s economy and which was found to be insolvent mainly because of bad
lending practices with loans extended to related parties. However, Privatbank is
servicing 20 million customers providing to them state-of-the-art digital banking
5
and other electronic services. IMF has demanded that the resolution of this issue as
well as the recapitalisation of other banks, as it resulted from the AQRs performed
by NBU, is a prerequisite for the disbursement of its 4th tranche which in fact was
executed successfully by the Ukrainian administration.
As a result the banking sector presented record losses in 2016 of US$6.2 billion
(Privatbank US$5.2 billion). 1Q17 is already in profit (US$220 million) and is
expected to continue increasing throughout the year.
The current landscape is that 40 banks make up the 98% of the assets, the top 20
the 90.2%, the top 10 the 74% and of which 10 the top 4 banks are state owned and
make up the 52% of the assets.
Top 20 banks in Ukraine
For the State Owned Banks, namely Privatbank, Oschadbank, Ukrexim and
Ukrgas, the plan is that they prepare them for sale in the medium term, in around
2-3 years. To this purpose EBRD mostly and IFC to a lesser extent has been
assisting the Government by placing directors in the Supervising Boards of these
banks, so that corporate governance is implemented.
6
The Russian government owned banks, making up the 8.4% of the banking assets,
are heavily undercapitalised being below the required norms because of
underprovided problematic loan portfolios with NBU imposing certain sanctions.
Moreover, there have been many aggressive actions from Ukrainian activists
because of the war conflict and all of them, namely Sberbank, VTB (controls two
banks in Ukraine, VTB and BM Bank) and Prominvestbank, have announced their
departure by selling the banks. So far the sale of Sberbank has been agreed to
Norvik bank of Latvia that belongs to individuals of Russian origin, pending the
approval from the NBU.
The banks with Ukrainian capital in the top 20 banks share 6% of assets with the
most notable being FUIB of Mr Akhmetov.
Proposal
I would propose the acquisition of a profitable bank with lower than the average
NPL portfolio, operated by a West European shareholder, with a reasonable market
share and of a digestible acquisition price in order to capture the projected 4-year
economic growth trend in Ukraine (base scenario by IMF and EBRD) in a market
with:
▪ Small competition
Analysing the current landscape of the top 20 banks that command around 90%
market share of assets, there are very few banks that would be competent to
pursue business development given their specific circumstances.
The state owned banks that command the 52% are obviously bothered with
trapped legacy and corporate governance issues. All four banks are also
preparing for their potential privatisation, however, the task of transforming the
mentality of the staff of these banks to that similar of a private one should be
close to impossible, at least for a period of 3 years. I would have thought that
their liquidity would be most probably invested in government titles rather than
pursuing loans aggressively by competing at low interest rates.
The Russian government owned banks that command 8.4% are already at the
“sales process” stage and I believe that there will be no European investors that
would invest in such banks that are undercapitalised as officially NBU has
confirmed, with most of their loans being NPEs.

!
!
!
Effectively the banks that could compete and have the size and access to
cheaper foreign exchange funding as well as trade finance capabilities are
Raiffeisen, Ukrsib, Credit Agricole and OTP accounting for 12.6% collectively.
Raiffeisen is engaged in dealing with the retail business and the work out of
their NPLs. However, its long-serving CEO Mr Lavrenchuk is rumoured to
become the Governor of NBU and the management team will be replaced with
expatriates from Raiffeisen’s head office. This move will create a major upset in
the bank’s structure and may result to a major change in strategy with a
considerable time to be needed for bringing the bank back to smooth operation.
Alfa who have bought over Unicredito’s Ukrsots bank (6.5% combined) and
who have historically being engaged in retail lending and large corporates
should continue to pursue this business and should devote resources to the
merger with Ukrsots and manage the business lending that should take some
time to grasp. Rumours say that they will initiate the merger process in not less
than a year and already they have discontinued new business lending servicing
existing customers only.
FUIB have been given a plan to recapitalise the bank or decrease their assets
and therefore they are out of the business for the time being.
ING and Citi are providing large corporate and investment banking services
only.
▪ Improving quality of borrowers
Following the improvement in collecting taxes and the enactment of new
legislation, and therefore decreasing the non-declared income, as well as the
significant increase in commodity prices and the increase in disposable income,
credit affordability has increased among business and individuals.
▪ Increasing loans and deposits that suffice for the credit growth
Evolution of loans and deposits 2015-2021
The European prospect of Ukraine that is supported not only politically but
also from the international financial institutions along with the effort of the
8
government to execute the structural reforms and hence achieve the economic
growth projected, should allow the access of the Ukrainian enterprises to the
European market and lead to further consolidation in the banking market.
In particular the loans market should increase and is projected by IMF at
US$17.5 billion in the period 2018-2021 (9.9% CAGR). It is anticipated that
there will be a significant demand for investment loans so that SMEs and large
corporates invest in infrastructure in order to produce products and services at
standards accepted in the EU countries.
Deposits are increasing (1Q17: 1.3% comprising increase in UAH deposits of
3.8% and decrease in FC of 1.9% mainly due to the repayment of foreign
currency guaranteed deposits of liquidated banks back in hryvnia). The trend is
expected to increase because of the return of trust to the public (estimated
money “under the mattresses” US$6-10 billion).
▪ Potential for high commission income
Commission income in 2016 amounted to US$922 million representing 34% of
the total banking revenue (25% for banks with foreign capital) exceeding the
average of the European banks. The most significant types of commission are
related to foreign exchange and money transfers. The difference in the share of
commissions in the banking revenue between the banks with foreign capital and
the banking sector average is mainly due to the fact that state owned banks are
the exclusive banking providers for the government organisations. There are
actions from the Banks’ Association to change to ratings criteria to introduce
fair competition.
In 2016 total commissions returned 2.8% on assets. Considering that the
sector’s balance comprises 37% cash and securities, this return is deemed high.
In general Ukrainians are accustomed to high commissions and in paying for
services. Commission income is expected to grow even further as exports and
disposable income would be growing.
▪ Consolidation prospect
Opportunity to participate in the forthcoming consolidation of the sector,
ripping the benefits of acquiring customers from state owned banks at least and
grow organically.
9
Ukrsib bank
I have considered a number of banks (Appendix I) and given my experience in the
country, Ukrsib is my top choice for the following reasons:
▪ Image of a European reliable, ethical, healthy bank with good electronic
banking solutions (Top 5 in 2017) servicing first class corporate customers and
their employees. The shareholders comprise BNP Paribas (60%) and EBRD
(40%).
▪ Good coverage ratio of problematic loans, a practice of French banks we have
observed in many occasions with recent experience in Greece with Credit
Agricole and Soc Gen.
The NPL ratio is 31% (EUR 301 million), less than the 36.4% average for
banks with foreign capital, and coverage of around 80%. From the 2016 audited
annual accounts, the remaining 20% net of reserves NPL portfolio is covered 4
times by collateral. The most problematic loans population has been that of
mortgages in foreign currency and it seems that Ukrsib has provisioned this part
adequately.

▪ The bank is overcapitalised at 21.37% CAD mainly due to subordinated debt
provided by EBRD in USD during the years of crisis. About EUR 135 million
were outstanding at 1.5% (1Q17: EUR 104 million) with their contribution to
regulatory capital being EUR 73 million which is equivalent to 7.51% CAD
ratio. The minimum CAD required by NBU is 10%. 71% of the subordinated is
due to be repaid in 2019.

******************************************************************
Although Raiffeisen has already undergone a sales process twice, the last being 3
years ago, without success, I still consider the amount of its equity at EUR 350
million a very large amount to invest for gaining 0.8% more market share than that
of Ukrsib.
This information is as much I could gather but I will meet with EBRD for other
reasons and will try to extract more information mostly on the intentions of BNP in
dealing with their Ukrainian presence. From what I know EBRD’s 40% is
considered exceptionally high as equity participation percentage comparing to their
usual 10-15% and most probably they would be willing to listen to exit scenarios,
possibly remaining as shareholders at a lower percentage.
I think it is too early to discuss potential price but having EBRD inside already I
would assume that 1x less due diligence adjustments should be the maximum,
17
possibly around 0.8, with 0.5x being the floor. An indicative amount for buying the
90% of the shares with EBRD holding the remaining 10% should be in the region
of EUR 110 million.
I expect that an IRR greater than 25% can be achieved considering the profitability
of the current assets at c. EUR 50 million excluding trading gains, the additional
profitability from organic expansion in lending at the levels assumed by IMF for
the banking market and assuming that the exit from the investment will be
achieved at the same multiple as that of the entry level (0.8x).
I am available at any time to discuss the above. Should your investors be interested
in the project I would be more than happy to meet them and arrange their meeting
with EBRD. The next step following our meeting with EBRD would be to meet
BNP and, in case they accept a bilateral process, to arrange and manage the deal
process. As discussed my main objective is to lead manage the bank with a
competent management team, to be compensated by “sweat equity”, and looking
forward to be a major participant in the consolidation of the industry.
I will also send to you the latest benchmarking review of the banking sector we are
preparing for your perusal.
Best regards,
Yannis

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016245.txt,"THE LIMITATIONS OF OPAQUE LEARNING MACHINES
Judea Pearl

Judea Pearl is a professor of computer science and director of the Cognitive Systems
Laboratory at UCLA. His most recent book, co-authored with Dana Mackenzie, is The
Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect.

As a former physicist, I was extremely interested in cybernetics. Though it did not utilize
the full power of Turing Machines, it was highly transparent, perhaps because it was
founded on classical control theory and information theory. We are losing this
transparency now, with the deep-learning style of machine learning. It is fundamentally a
curve-fitting exercise that adjusts weights in intermediate layers of a long input-output
chain.

I find many users who say that it “works well and we don’t know why.” Once
you unleash it on large data, deep learning has its own dynamics, it does its own repair
and its own optimization, and it gives you the right results most of the time. But when it
doesn’t, you don’t have a clue about what went wrong and what should be fixed. In
particular, you do not know if the fault is in the program, in the method, or because things
have changed in the environment. We should be aiming at a different kind of
transparency.

Some argue that transparency is not really needed. We don’t understand the
neural architecture of the human brain, yet it runs well, so we forgive our meager
understanding and use human helpers to great advantage. In the same way, they argue,
why not unleash deep-learning systems and create intelligence without understanding
how they work? I buy this argument to some extent. I personally don’t like opacity, so I
won’t spend my time on deep learning, but I know that it has a place in the makeup of
intelligence. I know that non-transparent systems can do marvelous jobs, and our brain is
proof of that marvel.

But this argument has its limitation. The reason we can forgive our meager
understanding of how human brains work is because our brains work the same way, and
that enables us to communicate with other humans, learn from them, instruct them, and
motivate them in our own native language. If our robots will all be as opaque as
AlphaGo, we won’t be able to hold a meaningful conversation with them, and that would
be unfortunate. We will need to retrain them whenever we make a slight change in the
task or in the operating environment.

So, rather than experimenting with opaque learning machines, I am trying to
understand their theoretical limitations and examine how these limitations can be
overcome. I do it in the context of causal-reasoning tasks, which govern much of how
scientists think about the world and, at the same time, are rich in intuition and toy
examples, so we can monitor the progress in our analysis. In this context, we’ve
discovered that some basic barriers exist, and that unless they are breached we won’t get
areal human kind of intelligence no matter what we do. I believe that charting these
barriers may be no less important than banging our heads against them.

Current machine-learning systems operate almost exclusively in a statistical, or
model-blind, mode, which is analogous in many ways to fitting a function to a cloud of
data points. Such systems cannot reason about “what if ?” questions and, therefore,

Off to Moscow

They talk about Russia like it’s the worst place on earth. Russia’s
great.

—EDWARD SNOWDEN, Moscow, 2015

EFORE FLYING TO Moscow, I arranged to have dinner with

Oliver Stone at an Italian restaurant on the Upper East Side of
New York. I had greatly respected Stone’s ability as a film director
after watching him work on Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, a film
in which I had a cameo role. I had also debated Stone about the his-
torical accuracy of his 1991 movie JFK at Town Hall in New York.

When we dined, he had just written, produced, and directed
Snowden, an independently financed film depicting Snowden, as
Stone put it, as “one of the great heroes of the twenty-first century.”
In preparing for it, Stone had seen Snowden in 2013 and 2014 and
had had a six-hour meeting with Putin.

I wanted to talk to Stone not to learn about the film but to learn
how he had gained access to Snowden in Moscow. I knew from the
documents taken from Sony Pictures Entertainment—allegedly by
North Korea—that Stone had paid The Guardian $700,000 for the
film rights to The Snowden Files, a book written by Luke Harding.

time. Often, if a problem seems impossible, he will sleep on it. When he
wakes the next morning, he will frequently find the problem has solved
itself and a solution is ready at hand.

Art

The final class of creative thinking we generally recognize is artistic skill.
This is probably a form of convergent thinking, except both the problem
and the solution are open. Good artists are considered highly creative
and most people tend to agree on what constitutes good art. There are
some arguments but they are usually more about genres. I might not
appreciate modern installation art, even to the point of declaring it, “not
art” But, when forced to ignore their prejudices most people tend to
agree on the distinction between good and bad.

Painting, sculpture, music, architecture and poetry are the
traditional fine arts. There is often some argument over architecture: is
it not too ‘functional to be considered an artistic endeavor? After all,
art is not supposed to have any purpose other than to be, well, art. This
definition inevitably leads to arguments about whether bad art is still ‘art’
Art should be artful and how do you arrange a pile of used tires artfully?
But this isa very narrow definition. I prefer to define art as something that
provokes an emotional response in the beholder. Using this definition,
the fact that a pile of tires disgusts and annoys you is exactly the point.
Perhaps a more ‘enlightened’ viewer than you is intrigued by the clever
use of materials.

Regardless, we consider art to be a creative endeavor and we can
measure it using the criteria of novelty and quality. Since most people
agree on these measures for a given piece of art, we can use the wisdom
of crowds to give us a scientific scale. That does not mean there won't be
art that you love but which leaves me cold. That is the joy of it. Novelty
and quality are not the same as joy and pleasure, far less the tingle factor.

A quick test for artistic skill is to take a pen and paper and turn to
the person sitting on your left and try to sketch them.

TRY IT!

Vinit Sahni/db/IIIIIIIIIIII 
Just got off the phone with Vinit. 
DB stopped marketmaking OTC oil options - for short dated Pd go for exch traded - better liquidity and lower transaction costs in and 
out. 
My central scenario - Kerry Lavrov meeting Friday will be a bust and the Crimea referendum this weekend will result in yes given 
the 59pct ethic Russian makeup. Sunday/ Monday sanction rhetoric from ranging from g8 expulsion to Iran-style bank embargo is 
raised a notch. Russia follows with more threats of counter-sanctions. My sense is the Obama 5m of 696m SPR release is to show 
Merkel and co he will step in. He needs to because there are 8 small European and Baltic countries that rec 70%+ of their gas from 
Russia. Germany gets 30%. 
Cross asset correlations outside of the US are increasing past few days - eg copper and the Turkish lira hourly charts are on top of each 
other past 4 days. I'm worried there is a 30-40pct(?) chance of a hard risk off move in markets in first half of next week - more focused 
on European equities, copper, EM FX (Turkey, ZAR, Ruble etc) than SPX. In that scenario oil is way up. 
Exchange WTI calls - there are 2 options (as of 3pm est): 
5day expiry 17march 2014 underlying clj4 97.92 
and 
35d expiry 16apri12014 underlying clk4 97.59 
** The 5 day options are a bit short - one possibility is sell a 3usd out of the money put (95.5 strike) for 20cents and buy a 2usd OTM 
100 call for 25. Net pay Scents. But 5d is a bit short for me. 
**For 35d expiry You could look at selling 91.50 (6usd OTM put) for 56cents and buying 103c (5.5usd OTM) for 58cents or the 102c 
(4.5usd OTM) for 76cents. 
CL1 <comdty> OMON on Bloomberg has live strikes and bid/ask.

If 5d is too short and 35d is too long / not enough gamma, Tazia may be able to source liquidity from the street. Am Cc'ing her for any

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025112.txt,"Following are the key areas of breakthrough in sleep and dreams (from Patrick). Patrick states that these are
now reproducible, non-controversial, and well-accepted among experts, although still not appreciated by the
public - hence the high value of our CTT TV series. The organizing idea is why and how are sleep and
dreams essential for normal memory consolidation and bodily health / well-being.

Memory Consolidation. There is a fundamental difference between REM and NREM Sleep for memory
consolidation: REM is for emotional memories, whereas NREM is for declarative and procedural memories.
Hence, understanding and dealing with REM emotional memories can lead to treatment for the many
neuropsychiatric illnesses that have sleep/dream-related disorders or syndromes (Parkinson’s Disease,
Anxiety, Substance Abuse, many sleep disorders such as Nightmare Disorder, etc., in addition to PTSD and
Depression). Research shows bi-directional causality between neuropsychiatric disorders and sleep disorders.
This is a superb example of how fundamental science breakthroughs lead to clinical breakthroughs. This fact
that REM is associated with emotional memories is nicely consistent with the apparent psychotic nature of
dreams, because in REM Sleep the frontal cortex is ‘down-regulated’ (and the frontal cortex is associated
with rational planning, reflection, controlling impulses), while in REM Sleep the limbic system is ‘up-
regulated” (and the limbic system is associated with emotions and feelings) — see Neuroimaging below. This
is why dream states flood the ego with emotional fantasies without rational control. However, it is also true
that the limbic system enables creative ideas, thus grounding in science the long-suspected idea that sleep
and dreams can enhance creativity.

As Dr. Robert Stickgold, our other advisor on the series, wrote: “It would be nice if we could talk about sleep
and memory as if there were only one type of memory and one type of sleep. But this is far from the case.
Sleep and memory each comes in many forms, and furthermore, memories can go through multiple forms of
post-encoding processing that must be individually addressed.”

Immunity / Immune System. Strengthening the immune system is now a proven product of NREM sleep.
Discerning the evolutionary basis for this is a key research project (1.e., it seems counter-intuitive

that sleeping facilitates fitness for survival in that predators lurked in the jungles and on the plains so that
going unconscious during sleep does not, at first glance, seem especially adaptive). Studies of sleep in
various non-human animals reveals a direct relationship between longer periods of NREM (Slow-Wave)
Sleep and a stronger immune system, especially in fighting parasites. NREM Sleep releases molecules that
fight inflection; NREM Sleep works for the maintenance, repair and activation of the immune system. (This
gives scientific rationale for the need or desire to sleep during illnesses.) Related are “genetic conflict”
studies with respect to REM and NREM, showing differences in heredity between material and paternal
lines, and differences between males and females in which genes get “imprinted”.

Neuroplasticity. Exciting recent research has reversed the century-long conventional wisdom that new
neurons are never created in adult animals/humans. The development of new neurons — neuronogenesis — is a
vital part of maintaining normal brain and mental functioning. New neurons are being created, importantly,
in the hippocampus (brain organ where new memories are encoded) — but, remarkably, the neuronogensis in
the hippocampus occurs only/largely during REM Sleep — a stunning finding. This is another reason why
REM sleep is needed for emotional memory consolidation (normal functioning).

Dream-Content. Although dreams have sparked human fascination and fantasy for thousands of years, only
in very recent years, have large-scale surveys been conducted with rigorous design, classifications and

I have taken heat for years over the fact that i gave you no more than carlyns name, . no follow up
questions no interactions , not even one single question asked of me re her work. (that was Eileen _)
but somehow carlyns fuck up was my doing. . _ when i told you that i thought Eileen wasn't up to the
task, you bellowed that i was talking out of both sides of my mouth. . You told me this year , that by
trying to protect you from crazy joslin, I had in essence fired him and it was my responsibility to do his
work. it then turns out that he didn't consider himself fired at all he just received less money. and
continued to make a really dangerous mess.. Joshn castrucci, in your eyes , was also my doing , though
email after email said , I take no responsibility for him,and 1YOU SHOULD NOT HIRE HIM |!!! , your
response was that was my opinion was only because i didn't trust him. then to add insult to injury last jan
you told me he was gone. however he too is still there, and a waste of money and space.

My time is complicated by Donald's potentially eviscerating any reason for anyone to use the
foreign funds repatriation plan that i had put together. . however as you are aware I have some decisions
to make re my time allocation in the next year or two. so at least for a few weeks I am unable to commit
much time and make any future plans to guide you in the redoing of your procrastination produced
mess.

That being said, the tasks at hand are the following.
You have a bomb of colored string that your retarded children have formed , It has to be very carefully
unwound , even the substitution of Barry for your next trustee, needs a careful focus on procedure.s It
would be much preferable if Wechsler was not his replacement. do you have any person you trust ??! . I
am concerned re brad taking barrys place re XXXX. In the beginning Barry will need to find and learn
ACCURATE . org charts. books , balance sheets . trust valuations. are all a part. Barry will need 2
months to just get his arm around what is there , this is before any needed modifications.,

a way overdue re- fresh of your estate plan. . clats , trust. partnerships. grats. Ilcs. bank accounts ,
filing requirements. etc. the long awaited review of the brh tra and shareholders agreement to see how
they fit into new plan. . XXXXX planning. art partnership engagement .. , airplane re-do. , buying

months to review now. . you CANNOT file unreviewed audited documents. .CANNOT!!! _ this will
be very detailed work. . a self inflicted wound - all avoidable if professionals had been in place to limit .
or contain it. . . you will need 3 new hires .as there is no one in your office that is truly an A player. I
have great hope in Barry as you know. He will need to be trained. note

; One year is my guesstimate After 4 years of telling you , that you could do better than Halperin, : im
glad that you now are willing to follow barrys advice . I take no offense , in fact I take comfort in the
fact that after only one conversation with Barry you are now convinced to make that change . will take a
year or more.

I expect as a friend you will understand that

As Bitcoin Ownership is Not Anonymous, Illicit Use has Fallen _ Division

Larry Fink on Bitcoin’s Illicit Use

Bitcoin just shows you how much demand for money
laundering there is in the world. That’: all it is. It's an

index of money laundering.”

— BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, October 13, 2017

= Because bitcoin is pseudonymous, not anonymous, users’ real-world identities are ascertainable once the individual
converts bitcoin to fiat currency.

= Digital intelligence companies continually scan the blockchain to identify suspicious transaction activity.

 The Blockchain Intelligence Group estimates that illegal transactions in bitcoin fell from ~50% of total volume in 2015
to ~20% in 2016, and represent “significantly less than that” today.

= As law enforcement has become better able to track bitcoin ransom, cybercriminals have begun to favor currencies that
allow anonymity, such as Monero and Zcash, and even Ether.

that Hamas has a regional focus, while al Qaeda's is global. Hamas
bears no love for the United States, but it has not deliberately targeted
Americans. Al Qaeda, of course, sees the United States as its primary
enemy, and it doesn't stop there. European countries, supposed
enemies of Islam such as Russia and India, and Arab regimes of all
stripes are on their hit list. Other components of the Salafi-jihadist
movement (of which al Qaeda is a part) focus operations on killing
Shiite Muslims, whom they view as apostates. Hamas, in contrast,
does not call for the overthrow of Arab regimes and works with
Shiite Iran and the Alawite-dominated secular regime in Damascus,
pragmatically preferring weapons, money, and assistance in training
to ideological consistency.

Hamas, like its parent organization, the Muslim Brotherhood, also
devotes much of its attention to education, health care, and social
services. Like it or not, by caring for the poor and teaching the next
generation of Muslims about its view of the world, Hamas is
fundamentally reshaping Palestinian society. Thus, many Palestinians
who do not share Hamas's worldview nonetheless respect it; in part
because the Palestinian moderates so beloved of the West have often
failed to deliver on basic government functions. The old Arab
nationalist visions of the 1950s and 1960s that animated the moderate
Palestinian leader Mahmood Abbas and his mentor Yasir Arafat have
less appeal to Palestinians today.

One of the greatest differences today, as the Arab spring raises the
hope that democracy will take seed across the Middle East, is that
Hamas accepts elections (and, in fact, took power in Gaza in part
because of them) while al Qaeda vehemently rejects them. For
Ayman al-Zawahiri, Osama bin Ladin's deputy and presumed heir-
apparent, elections put man's (and, even worse, woman's) wishes
above God's. A democratic government could allow the sale of
alcohol, cooperate militarily with the United States, permit women to

Hillary Clinton presidential campaign.

It is a curious attribute of his character that, other
than perhaps being more circumspect about what legal
advice to follow, Epstein would have done little
differently. (When I suggested recently to Epstein that
one obvious way to blunt the animus bearing down on
him would be to get married, he said he’d rather go back
to jail.) His life, living it as he wants, seems to him to be
an extraordinary accomplishment. Being on the wrong
side of morality, custom, politics, feminists, the media,
that’s just a bit of bad luck.

And it is perhaps this attitude of his that irks his
critics the most. Although he has spent more than a year
in jail and paid out what may be as much as $20 million,
he yet seems somehow to have gotten away with it—
that worst sin of all. He is the unrepentant catchall of
up-to-the-minute badness: the financier whose wealth is
a product of Wall Street math rather than work; a rich
middle-age white man who not only parades his wealth
and entitlement, but has a Peter Pan complex to boot; an
insistent playboy (excuse me, pedophile) in a correct
and prudish world—someone who somehow didn’t get
the memo about vast changes in mores and culture.

But Epstein’s friends—and I think that is, in the
end, the best word for the powerful people who orbit
him—are willing to take him as he comes. Epstein is
their confidant. Not the only nexus of them, but one of

the book of life before we’ve read it.

Biodiversity is a crucial component of long-term human wellbeing. We're clearly
harmed if fish stocks dwindle to extinction; there are plants in the rain forest whose
gene pool might be useful to us. But for many environmentalists , preserving the
richness of our biosphere has value in its own right, over and above what it means to
us humans To quote the great ecologist EO Wilson ‘mass extinction is the sin that
future generations will least forgive us for’.

CLIMATE CHANGE

So the world’s getting more crowded. And there’s a second firm prediction: it will
gradually get warmer. In contract to population issues, climate change is certainly
not under-discussed — though it is under-acted-upon

The famous Keeling curve shows how the concentration of CO2 in the air is rising,
mainly due to the burning of fossil fuels .

The fifth IPCC report presented temperature- projections, for different assumptions
about future rates of fossil fuel use. For each such assumption there’s a spread
bevause it remains unclear how much the climatic effects of CO2 are amplified by
associated changes in water vapour and clouds — the so-called sensitivity factor.

IPCC PROJECTIONS

But despite these uncertainties the science tells is that under ‘business as usual’
scenarios we can’t rule out, by 2100, really catastrophic warming, and tipping points
triggering long-term trends like the melting of Greenland’s icecap.

Sadly, many deny this. But even among those who accept that this threat is real,
there is a range of views. These stem from differences in economics and ethics -- in
particular, in how much obligation we should feel towards future generations.

Bjorn Lomberg’s Copenhagen Consensus, for instance applies commercial-style
discounting -- and in effect writes off what happens beyond 2050. So, unsurprisingly
he downplays the priority of addressing climate change in comparison with shorter-
term efforts to help the world’s poor.

But if you care about those who'll live into the 22* century and beyond, then, as
economists like Stern and Weizman argue, you deem it worth paying an insurance

premium now, to protect those generations against the worst-case scenarios.

Above all, it depends on an ethical issue — in optimizing people’s life-chances, should
we discriminate on grounds of date of birth?

legal team, which includes Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz
(remember O.J. Simpson?) and Kenneth Starr (remember Monica Lewinsky?). Jack
Goldberger of West Palm Beach, who's also on the team, told Post columnist Jose
Lambiet in November: This case is absolutely going to end without a trial within
the next two months.”

He was wrong, but Mr. Goldberger remains on Mr. Epstein's payroll, feigning
moral outrage at two lawsuits filed this year against the Manhattan money
manager. The lawsuits allege sexual exploitation of teenaged girls, one of
them as young as 14. Said Mr. Goldberger after the first lawsuit, seeking
more than $50 million, was filed on Jan. 24: We think this shows what this
case is all about: money.” Yes, it is - Mr. Epstein's effort to buy his way out
of prosecution.

According to the lawyer of a 17-year-old whose parents are suing him, Mr. Epstein

masturbated in front of her (she was 14 at the time) and used a vibrator on her at his
home in February 2005. Another Epstein attorney, Lilly Ann Sanchez dismissed it:

Jeffrey Epstein did not have sex with this woman.

For those girls who claim that he did, Mr. Epstein's lawyers maintain that he did not
know their ages, despite a police search of his home and garbage that found phone
messages about the girls' school schedules and even a high school transcript. For all of
his money, Mr. Epstein's best defense remains I didn't know that I was a criminal
pervert?

Palm Beach Post Editorial #4

Rich man fought the law and he mostly won
Palm Beach Post Editorial

Monday, July 07, 2008

Two years after a grand jury indicted him on a felony charge of solicitation of
prostitution, Jeffrey Epstein finally admitted that he lured a teenage girl to his $8.5
million, 13,000-square-foot Palm Beach mansion for sex. A week ago, the 55-yearold
investment banker began serving 18 months in jail.

But that plea deal - guilty of felony solicitation of prostitution and procuring a

person under the age of 18 for prostitution - does not account for all five of the girls,

one as young as 14, who alleged that Epstein sexually abused them. And why is Epstein
serving his term in the overcrowded Palm Beach County Jail and not a state prison, where
inmates are sent if their sentences are longer than one year?

The slow, dissatisfying resolution of the case sends a message to the public

Post your that there's a different system of justice for the wealthy who hire high-

Gee, maybe after OButtbreath leaves office, evidence will come out of his visit to HOMOsexual bath houses,
HOMOsexual rendezvous and relationships and dare I say? Evidence of pedophilia with underage boys.
OButtbreath has made many enemies as has his wife and the Clintons both. A bit coincidental that the last two

data, rather than mainly embodying speculative notions; however, given the current state of
knowledge, this could not be done to a complete extent, and there is still some speculation
involved here and there.

While based on understandings of human intelligence, the integrative diagram is intended to
serve as an architectural outline for human-like general intelligence more broadly. For example,
CogPrime is explicitly not intended as a precise emulation of human intelligence, and does many
things quite differently than the human mind, yet can still fairly straightforwardly be mapped
into the integrative diagram.

The integrative diagram focuses on structure, but this should not be taken to represent a
valuation of structure over dynamics in our approach to intelligence. Following chapters treat
various dynamical phenomena in depth.

5.2 Key Ingredients of the Integrative Human-Like Cognitive
Architecture Diagram

The main ingredients we’ve used in assembling the integrative diagram are as follows:

e Our own views on the various types of memory critical for human-like cognition, and the
need for tight, synergetic interactions between the cognitive processes focused on these

e Aaron Sloman’s high-level architecture diagram of human intelligence [Slo01], drawn from
his CogAff architecture, which strikes me as a particularly clear embodiment of modern
common sense regarding the overall architecture of the human mind. We have added only
a couple items to Sloman’s high-level diagram, which we felt deserved an explicit high-level
role that he did not give them: emotion, language and reinforcement.

e The LIDA architecture diagram presented by Stan Franklin and Bernard Baars [BF 09].
We think LIDA is an excellent model of working memory and what Sloman calls reactive
processes, with well-researched grounding in the psychology and neuroscience literature.
We have adapted the LIDA diagram only very slightly for use here, changing some of
the terminology on the arrows, and indicating where parts of the LIDA diagram indicate
processes elaborated in more detail elsewhere in the integrative diagram.

e The architecture diagram of the Psi model of motivated cognition, presented by Joscha
Bach in [Bac09] based on prior work by Dietrich Dorner [Dér02]. This diagram is presented
without significant modification; however it should be noted that Bach and Dorner present
this diagram in the context of larger and richer cognitive models, the other aspects of which
are not all incorporated in the integrative diagram.

e James Albus’s three-hierarchy model of intelligence [AMO1], involving coupled perception,
action and reinforcement hierarchies. Albus’s model, utilized in the creation of intelligent
unmanned automated vehicles, is a crisp embodiment of many ideas emergent from the field
of intelligent control systems.

e Deep learning networks as a model of perception (and action and reinforcement learning),
as embodied for example in the work of Itamar Arel [ARC09] and Jeff Hawkins [HB06]. The
integrative diagram adopts this as the basic model of the perception and action subsystems
of human intelligence. Language understanding and generation are also modeled according
to this paradigm.

fall. In fact, WE are making a statement that women should not be judged based
on their external beauty and should be rewarded for their intellect and hard work.

The majority of our society still emphasizes the importance of female physical
qualities, such as beauty, body, or photogenic skills. Miss USA, the famous Beauty
Pageant previously owned by Donald Trump, until this summer required the
participants to pose in a swimsuit paired with high heels. Effective this year, the
show will abolish the bikini contest. We think that it is time to take one step
further and to finally start rewarding women for their mind, hard work, and
creativity.

Our idea is to host a “Beauty Pageant” for female entrepreneurs and to have the
top five finalists do a five-minute pitch in front of our jury. The finalists will not
only get a money prize, but also receive a significant exposure to investors and
media. We are hoping to get at least a few hundred applications as the application
is completely free. Female founders should have equal opportunities and
resources to their male counterparts. We hope that our event will encourage other
female entrepreneurs and help them advance in their careers.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011522.txt,"But a series of accidents, in Israel’s life and in mine, would soon point me in
a dramatically different direction. The first became known as the Rotem Crisis,
and it delivered a jolting reminder of Israel’s vulnerability to a surprise attack
from neighboring Arab states. Militarily, we were far stronger than in 1948. But
we were still a young country, at an early stage in our economic development.
Our defense strategy rested on a recognition we could not afford to sustain a
large standing army, relying instead on a pool of trained reservists. The problem
was that a full call-up of the reserves would require something like 48 hours.
That meant some form of early warning was critical.

Rotem erupted in February 1960, about halfway through my fironut, and
began almost farcically. The Chief of Military Intelligence, Chaim Herzog, was
at a diplomatic receiption in Tel Aviv when he began chatting with a guest he
knew well: the head of the local CIA station. What, the American asked, did he
make of the fact that Egypt had moved its two main armored divisions into the
Sinai, toward the border with Israel? Herzog came up with a suitably woolly
reply, about how it was obviously a situation which bore watching. But the truth
was that neither he nor anyone else in Israel had any idea about the Egyptian
mobilization. He left the party as soon as he could, to tell Dayan and Ben-
Gurion. When a reconnaissance flight the next day confirmed that dozens of
battle-ready tanks had been rolled forward toward the Suez Canal, Ben-Gurion
and the generals scrambled for a response.

They did not want a war. Ben-Gurion was particularly worried that in
responding to Nasser’s buildup, he might inadvertently escalate things further.
He vetoed the idea of a full mobilization. But he did order a more limited call-
up, of about 7,000 reservists. He placed the air force on alert. He directed the
four brigades responsible for the defense of southern Israel, including our
armored brigade near Beersheva, to move within a few miles of the border —
and gave us the additional role of sending several overnight munitions convoys
to equip the hastily assembled border force.

The first sign I saw that anything extraordinary was going on was the sudden
movement of tanks and APCs inside our camp. At first, no one told us raw
recruits anything. We were left to look on, and stay out of the way. But with our
operational units preparing to move forward, the problem was that there seemed
no one else with the expertise, experience and local knowledge to lead the
supply columns. So our training battalion was summoned before the platoon
commander. “Any volunteers,” he asked. When none of us raised a hand, he
said: “Come on. One of you must have grown up around here. That means the

"

no accident that the “frame rate,” at which we can distinguish that movies are
actually a sequence of stills, is about 40 per second. Thus, electronic
processing is close to a billion times faster.

e Size: The linear dimension of a typical neuron is about 10 microns.
Molecular dimensions, which set a practical limit, are about 10,000 times
smaller, and artificial processing units are approaching that scale. Smallness
makes communication more efficient.

e Stability: Whereas human memory 1s essentially continuous (analog),
artificial memory can incorporate discrete (digital) features. Whereas analog
quantities can erode, digital quantities can be stored, refreshed, and
maintained with complete accuracy.

e Duty Cycle: Human brains grow tired with effort. They need time off to take
nourishment and to sleep. They carry the burden of aging. Most profoundly:
They die.

e Modularity (open architecture): Because artificial information processors can
support precisely defined digital interfaces, they can readily assimilate new
modules. Thus, if we want a computer to “see” ultraviolet or infrared or
“hear” ultrasound, we can feed the output from an appropriate sensor directly
into its “nervous system.” The architecture of brains is much more closed and
opaque, and the human immune system actively resists implants.

e Quantum readiness: One case of modularity deserves special mention,
because of its long-term potential. Recently physicists and information
scientists have come to appreciate that the principles of quantum mechanics
support new computing principles, which can empower qualitatively new
forms of information processing and (plausibly) new levels of intelligence.
But these possibilities rely on aspects of quantum behavior which are quite
delicate and seem especially unsuitable for interfacing with the warm, wet,
messy enviroment of human brains.

Evidently, as platforms for intelligence, human brains are far from optimal. Still,
although versatile housekeeping robots or mechanical soldiers would find ready, lucrative
markets, at present there is no machine that approaches the kind of general-purpose
human intelligence those applications would require. Despite their relative weakness on
many fronts, human brains have some big advantages over their artificial competitors.
Let me mention five:

e Three-dimensionality: Although, as noted, the linear dimensions of existing
artificial processing units are vastly smaller than those of brains, the procedure by
which they’re made—centered on lithography (basically, etching)—is essentially
two-dimensional. That is revealed visibly in the geometry of computer boards
and chips. Of course, one can stack boards, but the spacing between layers is
much larger, and communication much less efficient, than within layers. Brains
make better use of all three dimensions.

e Self-repair: Human brains can recover from, or work around, many kinds of
injuries or errors. Computers often must be repaired or rebooted externally.

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021181.txt,"When I was noticed watching them, about fifteen of them came up to me
and began to beg for money and food. | was over taken by the poor,
hungry children and I felt sad for them all and wished I could help out
somehow. When the tide of kids washed away and the street went empty,
I was overcome with intrigue at these two little boys. Brothers I found out
later on, and there only toy was an empty can they were kicking to each
other in the middle of the street. Intelligent kids, they were able to speak
three different languages, including English and I was interested to ask
them about life here. They didn’t seem to notice or be bothered by their
poverty stricken lives. They told me about their school and parents and I
thought | had just heard the saddest story ever but they were accustomed
to living like that like I had been so accustomed to my degrading lifestyle
for so long.

1] was compelled to empty out the contents of my purse, giving them
over two thousand dollars in U.S currency. A passer-byer snapped a
photo of the kids and me for myself to take home as a personal souvenir
before they rushed home to proudly show there parents the money. I told
Jeffrey later on of my good deed and he couldn’t believe I’d give away
my money so carelessly. He told me | had set up their parents with
enough money to feed and shelter their family for a year. Wasn’t that a
good thing? I couldn’t believe it, not that | was well off or anything close
too it, but to realize how lucky I was and to not have compassion for the
lesser off, especially children of a third- world country, I wouldn’t be
human anymore. Then again what did I expect from someone who could
numerously steal another man’s daughter for the use of his own sexual
pleasure with great ease.

We went out to lunch the following day with Jeffrey’s team of
designers to wrap things up and after Jeffrey’s afternoon massage he went
to the palace to have a nap. When | was all alone I thought I’d go see the
culture of the local unique markets again and this time buy some trinkets
to bring home. I got to sightseeing and took pictures of the legs of lamb
hung over the blood drenched doorway over people’s homes as to warn
off evil spirits and the ghettos where the local villager’s called home. I
walked into many of the market’s stalls and saw the most peculiar
antiques, such as weaponry with the blood of it’s last victim stained on
it’s sharp blades and body pieces of various animal’s for the use of
religious sacrifices. I was more interested in the different culture and
respecting their ancient way of life with interest, instead of squirming like
a tourist and getting grossed out. I thought it was so educational and
enthralling in fact, [ ended up buying a few sacrificial trinkets to have
sent to my apartment in Palm Beach. Not to say that I wasn’t looking
forward to getting back to the luxuries of western civilization it was a bit
like camping, fun and adventurous but as equally dangerous and thrilling.

When we left for the final destination of our trip | was looking forward to
eating normal food again, not one to stray for foreign dishes, I’m a more
of a cheeseburger and pizza kind of girl, a true sign of my American
heritage.

We landed at the Heathrow Int’l Airport and greeted by a driver that
would take us to Ghislane’s town house in London’s central that Jeffrey
had recently bought and refurbished as a gift for her. Emmy said “Good-
Bye” at the airport, leaving us to go to her hometown in the rural
countryside nearby to visit family for a six-week holiday from work. It
wasn’t a very long drive before we were in the heart of the city and at
Ghislane’s place. I thought it was a cheery townhouse that had character
and the historical pub in front of it and cobblestone streets only added a
unique charm to its presence. They were going out for dinner and invited
me along with them but seeing | was so exhausted from all the travelling
and looking a bit melancholy, I apologetically declined going out for
dinner that evening, I rather would be taking a few pills to catch up on
some needed sleep. “Are you sure your Okay”? Ghislane asked as she
showed me to my room, more considerate than she normally was but |
assured her that | was in absolute good health, just tired from all of the
recent jet lag. Without another word said she whisked off downstairs, to
the car where Jeffrey was waiting for her.

I took the liberty to call my parents house to say “Hello” and catch up
with them since I hadn’t been home at all for the holiday season this year,
always too busy working. They sounded really happy to hear from me
and my mom put me on the phone to talk to my brothers as well. | got to
tell them about my travels abroad and I had some cool tribal stuff from
Africa that I bought for them. They sounded so proud of me, all of them,
and why shouldn’t they be? In everyone’s convinced mind I was making
great money, travelling the world, and meeting new faces everywhere |
went, why should I spoil anyone’s delusions, especially mine. | took my
sleeping tablets and had a bath before falling into a deep and much
needed sleep.

The next morning I was woken up by Ghislane who | could tell was in a
chirpy mood by the way she paraded through my closed door saying
“Wake-up sleepy head” and opened the window’s shutters to let in the
bright sunlight, she had never done anything like this before and I knew
immediately something big was happening. She sat down on my bed as I
rolled over from my deep slumber and | was able to mutter for an
explanation as to why she was awake so early. “Besides the fact it is ten
o’clock in the morning and nearly time for brunch, we have a big day
planned out for you today.” She was waiting for my cue to ask her “What
are we doing”, when I did, she responded with a convincing enthusiasm
“We're going shopping for a new ensemble” she paused for a moment to

will amp up the attention 10-fold, in fact, possibly, a hundred fold. Possibly more than anything you've
encountered before.

Meanwhile--

In a lawyer's letter, I'd suggest including the following points--not necessarily legal, but a warning about how
a press campaign might unfold (publishers are more worried about being caught in negative media
controversy than they are of legal threats):

1) Little, Brown has made on the record representations to at least one well-known journalist that it was not
publishing a book by James Patterson about Jeffrey Epstein--possibly an effort to avoid inquiries about the
questionable nature of the book;

2) The actual author of the book, John Connolly, is someone other than the stated author, James Patterson.
Connolly is known to have developed an obsession with Epstein, such that, his longtime employer, Vanity
Fair, has refused to allow him to write about Epstein for the magazine;

3) Sources have confirmed for us that Patterson has had little more than a minimal consulting role in the
book, and that Connolly has functioned in every material way as the book's researcher and writer. We believe
Patterson's authorship of the book will not stand up to scrutiny. And, indeed, that the entire notion of an
extension of the Patterson franchise into nonfiction, as it has been used in fiction and children's book--
effectively other authors writing under the Patterson name—presents a host of journalism ethical issues.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020027.txt,"By the afternoon, the national security team was experiencing a sense of rising panic:
the president, in their view, didn’t seem to be quite registering the situation. Bannon
wasn’t helping. His hyperrationalist approach obviously appealed to the not-always-
rational president. A chemical attack didn’t change the circumstances on the ground,
Bannon argued; besides, there had been far worse attacks with far more casualties than
this one. If you were looking for broken children, you could find them anywhere. Why
these broken children?

The president was not a debater—well, not in any Socratic sense. Nor was he in any
conventional sense a decision maker. And certainly he was not a student of foreign policy
views and options. But this was nevertheless turning into a genuine philosophical face-off.

“Do nothing” had long been viewed as an unacceptable position of helplessness by
American foreign policy experts. The instinct to do something was driven by the desire to
prove you were not limited to nothing. You couldn’t do nothing and show strength. But
Bannon’s approach was very much “A pox on all your houses,” it was not our mess, and
judging by all recent evidence, no good would come of trying to help clean it up. That
effort would cost military lives with no military reward. Bannon, believing in the need for
a radical shift in foreign policy, was proposing a new doctrine: Fuck ’em. This iron-fisted
isolationism appealed to the president’s transactional self: What was in it for us (or for
him)?

Hence the urgency to get Bannon off the National Security Council. The curious thing
is that in the beginning he was thought to be much more reasonable than Michael Flynn,
with his fixation on Iran as the source of all evil. Bannon was supposed to babysit Flynn.
But Bannon, quite to Kushner’s shock, had not just an isolationist worldview but an
apocalyptic one. Much of the world would burn and there was nothing you could do about
it.

The announcement of Bannon’s removal was made the day after the attack. That in
itself was a rather remarkable accomplishment on the part of the moderates. In little more
than two months, Trump’s radical, if not screwball, national security leadership had been
replaced by so-called reasonable people.

The job was now to bring the president into this circle of reason.

OOK Ok

As the day wore on, both Ivanka Trump and Dina Powell were united in their
determination to persuade the president to react ... normally. At the very minimum, an
absolute condemnation of the use of chemical weapons, a set of sanctions, and, ideally, a
military response—although not a big one. None of this was in any way exceptional.
Which was sort of the point: it was critical not to respond in a radical, destabilizing way—
including a radical nonresponse.

Kushner was by now complaining to his wife that her father just didn’t get it. It had

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013833.txt,"Professor Ed Zschau’s “High-Tech Entrepreneurship” class. Ferriss challenged Marrinan and his fellow
seniors to contact high-profile celebrities and CEOs and get their answers to questions they have always
wanted to ask.

For extra incentive, Ferriss promised the student who could contact the most hard-to-reach name and
ask the most intriguing question a round-trip plane ticket anywhere in the world.

“I believe that success can be measured in the number of uncomfortable conversations you’re willing
to have. I felt that if I could help students overcome the fear of rejection with cold-calling and cold e-
mail, it would serve them forever,” Ferriss said. “It’s easy to sell yourself short, but when you see
classmates getting responses from people like [former president] George Bush, the CEOs of Disney,
Comcast, Google, and HP, and dozens of other impossible-to-reach people, it forces you to reconsider
your self-set limitations.” ... Ferriss lectures to the students of “High-Tech Entrepreneurship” each
semester about creating a startup and designing the ideal lifestyle.

“I participate in this contest every day,” said Ferriss. “I do what I always do: find a personal e-mail if
possible, often through their little-known personal blogs, send a two- to three-paragraph e-mail which
explains that I am familiar with their work, and ask one simple-to-answer but thought-provoking
question in that e-mail related to their work or life philosophies. The goal is to start a dialogue so they
take the time to answer future e-mails—not to ask for help. That can only come after at least three or
four genuine e-mail exchanges.”

With “textbook execution of the Tim Ferriss Technique,” as he put it, Marrinan was able to strike up a
bond with Komisar. In his initial e-mail, he talked about reading one of Komisar’s Harvard Business
Review articles and feeling inspired to ask him, “When were you happiest in your life?” After Komisar
replied with references to Tibetan Buddhism, Marrinan responded, “Just as words are inadequate to
explain true happiness, so too are words inadequate to express my thanks.” His e-mail included his
personal translation of a French poem by Taisen Deshimaru, the former European head of Soto Zen. An
e-mail relationship was formed, and Komisar even e-mailed Marrinan a few days later with a link to a
New York Times article on happiness.

Contacting Schmidt proved more challenging. For Marrinan, the toughest part was getting Schmidt’s
personal e-mail address. He e-mailed a Princeton dean asking for it. No response. Two weeks later, he e-
mailed the same dean again, defending his request by reminding her that he had previously met Schmidt.
The dean said no, but Marrinan refused to give up. He e-mailed her a third time. “Have you ever made
an exception?” he asked. The dean finally gave in, he said, and provided him with Schmidt’s e-mail.

“I know some of my classmates pursued the alternative scattershot technique with some success, but
that’s not my bag,” Marrinan said, explaining his perseverance. “I deal with rejection by persisting, not
by taking my business elsewhere. My maxim comes from Samuel Beckett, a personal hero of mine:
‘Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.’ You won’t believe what you can
accomplish by attempting the impossible with the courage to repeatedly fail better.”

Nathan Kaplan, another participant in the contest, was most proud of the way that he was able to
contact former Newark mayor Sharpe James. Because James had made a campaign contribution to Al
Sharpton, the website www.fundrace.org listed James’s home address. Kaplan then input James’s address
into an online serach-by-address phone directory, through which he received the former mayor’s phone
number. Kaplan left a message for James, and a few days later finally got to ask him about childhood
education.

Ferriss is proud of the effort students have put into his contest. “Most people can do absolutely awe-
inspiring things,” he said. “Sometimes they just need a little nudge.”

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020033.txt,"The central problem was that the president was neither inclined to make fun of himself,
nor particularly funny himself—at least not, in Conway’s description, “in that kind of
humorous way.”

George W. Bush had famously resisted the Correspondents’ Dinner and suffered
greatly at it, but he had prepped extensively, and every year he pulled out an acceptable
performance. But neither woman, confiding their concerns around the small table in
Conway’s office to a journalist they regarded as sympathetic, thought Trump had a
realistic chance of making the dinner anything like a success.

“He doesn’t appreciate cruel humor,” said Conway.
“His style is more old-fashioned,” said Hicks.

Both women, clearly seeing the Correspondents’ Dinner as an intractable problem, kept
characterizing the event as “unfair,” which, more generally, is how they characterized the
media’s view of Trump. “He’s unfairly portrayed.” “They don’t give him the benefit of the
doubt.” “He’s just not treated the way other presidents have been treated.”

The burden here for Conway and Hicks was their understanding that the president did
not see the media’s lack of regard for him as part of a political divide on which he stood
on a particular side. Instead, he perceived it as a deep personal attack on him: for entirely
unfair reasons, ad hominem reasons, the media just did not like him. Ridiculed him.
Cruelly. Why?

The journalist, trying to offer some comfort, told the two women there was a rumor
going around that Graydon Carter—the editor of Vanity Fair and host of one of the most
important parties of the Correspondents’ Dinner weekend, and, for decades, one of
Trump’s key tormentors in the media—was shortly going to be pushed out of the
magazine.

“Really?” said Hicks, jumping up. “Oh my God, can I tell him? Would that be okay?
He’ll want to know this.” She headed quickly downstairs to the Oval Office.

OOK Ok

Curiously, Conway and Hicks each portrayed a side of the president’s alter ego media
problem. Conway was the bitter antagonist, the mud-in-your-eye messenger who reliably
sent the media into paroxysms of outrage against the president. Hicks was the confidante
ever trying to get the president a break and some good ink in the only media he really
cared about—the media that most hated him. But as different as they were in their media
functions and temperament, both women had achieved remarkable influence in the
administration by serving as the key lieutenants responsible for addressing the president’s
most pressing concern, his media reputation.

While Trump was in most ways a conventional misogynist, in the workplace he was
much closer to women than to men. The former he confided in, the latter he held at arm’s

some people would consider his timing quite poor from a more selfish survival standpoint.

He had also missed the memo. The national menu had changed, and they were out of luxuries like
bread and clean water. He would be surviving for four months on a slushlike concoction of corn meal
and spinach. Not what most of us would order at the movie theater.

J ean-Marc had passed the point of no return, but it didn’t matter. After two weeks of adjusting to the

breakfast, lunch, and dinner (Mush a la Ghana), he had no desire to escape. The most basic of foods and
good friends proved to be the only real necessities, and what would seem like a disaster from the outside
was the most life-affirming epiphany he’d ever experienced: The worst really wasn’t that bad. To enjoy
life, you don’t need fancy nonsense, but you do need to control your time and realize that most things
just aren’t as serious as you make them out to be.

Now 48, Jean-Marc lives in a nice home in Ontario, but could live without it. He has cash, but could
fall into poverty tomorrow and it wouldn’t matter. Some of his fondest memories still include nothing
but friends and gruel. He is dedicated to creating special moments for himself and his family and is
utterly unconcerned with retirement. He’s already lived 20 years of partial retirement in perfect health.

L, you are nervous about making the jump or simply putting it off out of fear of the unknown, here is

your antidote. Write down your answers, and keep in mind that thinking a lot will not prove as fruitful or
as prolific as simply brain vomiting on the page. Write and do not edit—aim for volume. Spend a few
minutes on each answer.

1. Define your nightmare, the absolute worst that could happen if you did what you are
considering. What doubt, fears, and “what-ifs” pop up as you consider the big changes you can—
or need—to make? Envision them in painstaking detail. Would it be the end of your life? What
would be the permanent impact, if any, on a scale of 1-10? Are these things really permanent?
How likely do you think it is that they would actually happen?

2. What steps could you take to repair the damage or get things back on the upswing, even if
temporarily? Chances are, it’s easier than you imagine. How could you get things back under
control?

3. What are the outcomes or benefits, both temporary and permanent, of more probable

scenarios? Now that you’ve defined the nightmare, what are the more probable or definite positive
outcomes, whether internal (confidence, self-esteem, etc.) or external? What would the impact of
these more-likely outcomes be ona scale of 1-10? How likely is it that you could produce at least
a moderately good outcome? Have less intelligent people done this before and pulled it off?

investors.” Edwards could not have possibly “pumped” the cases to investors when he
never participated in any communication with investors. However, Epstein’s
“pumping” claims fail for an even more basic reason: Edwards was entitled — indeed
ethically obligated as an attorney — to secure the maximum recovery for his clients
during the course of his legal representation. As is well known, “[a]s an advocate, a
lawyer zealously asserts the client’s position under the rules of the adversary system.”
Fla. Rules of Prof. Conduct, Preamble. Edwards therefore was required to pursue
(unless otherwise instructed by his clients) a maximum recovery against Epstein.
Edwards, therefore, could never be liable for doing something that his ethical duties as
an attorney required. In a further effort to harass Edwards, Epstein also filed a bar
complaint with the Florida Bar against Edwards. The Florida Bar dismissed the
complaint.

Another reason that Epstein’s claims that Edwards was “pumping” cases for investors
fails is that Edwards filed all three cases almost a year before he was hired by RRA or
even knew of Scott Rothstein. Epstein makes allegations that the complaints
contained sensational allegations for the purposes of luring investors; however,
language in the complaints remained virtually unchanged from the first filing in 2008
and overwhelming evidence supports the conclusion that all of the facts alleged by
Edwards in the complaints were true.

Epstein ultimately paid to settle all three of the cases Edwards filed against him for
more money than he paid to settle any of the other claims against him. At Epstein’s
request, the terms of the settlement were kept confidential. Epstein chose to make this
payment as the result of a federal court ordered mediation process, which he himself
sought (over the objection of Jane Doe, Edwards’ client in federal court) in an effort to
resolve the case. Notably, Epstein sought this settlement conference — and ultimately
made his payments as a result of that conference - in July 2010, more than seven
months after he filed this lawsuit against Edwards. Accordingly, Epstein could not
have been the victim of any scheme to “pump” the cases against him, because he
never paid to settle the cases until well after Edwards had left RRA, after Edwards had
severed all connection with Scott Rothstein (December 2009), and well after the
details of Rothstein’s Ponzi scheme had been widely publicized.

In addition, if Epstein had thought that there was some improper coercion involved in,
for example, Jane Doe’s case, his remedy was to raise the matter before Federal
District Court Judge Kenneth A. Marra who was presiding over the matter. Far from
raising any such claim, Epstein simply chose to settle that case. He was therefore
barred by the doctrine of res judicata from somehow re-litigating what happened in
(for example) the Jane Doe case. The doctrine of res judicata makes a judgment on
the merits conclusive ‘not only as to every matter which was offered and received to
sustain or defeat the claim, but as to every other matter which might with propriety

New Firepower in Shocking Suit Against
Trump

If you thought the presidential election couldn’t get any uglier, guess again. Because a suit against
Donald Trump alleging that he raped a 13-year-old girl has new life.
On Monday, Florida criminal defense lawyer J. Cheney Mason—best known for successfully
defending Casey Anthony, who was charged with killing her 2-year-old daughter—filed court papers
to represent “Jane Doe” in a suit against Trump and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.

The rape suit isn’t exactly new. It was filed pro se by “Katie Johnson” in Los Angeles federal court in
April, dismissed, refiled in the Southern District of New York, withdrawn and refiled on Sept. 30. But
with the addition of Mason—a media-savvy lawyer not known for shying away from the
spotlight—the stakes have changed.
Suddenly, it’s a lot more serious. Which is not the same as legitimate, but
the odds that the case will go away quietly are much slimmer given the
firepower of her new counsel. Especially now, in the wake of a 2005
recording where Trump bragged about using his star power to kiss and
grope women.
The allegations in the suit are truly awful. Jane Doe says that when she was
13, she attended parties at Epstein’s New York City townhouse, enticed by
promises of money and a modeling career. She allegedly had sexual
encounters with Trump on four occasions there.
The complaint states, “Defendant Trump tied plaintiff to a bed, exposed
himself to plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape plaintiff. During the
course of this savage sexual attack, plaintiff loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to stop but with no
effect. Defendant Trump responded to plaintiff’s pleas by violently striking plaintiff in the face with
his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted.”
Epstein allegedly raped her as well. In 2008, he pleaded guilty to soliciting an underage girl for
prostitution, and has faced other suits by women who allege underage sexual assault.
Trump’s lawyer Alan Garten, has unequivocally denied the allegations. In fact, the current complaint
quotes his denial: “The allegations are not only categorically false, but disgusting at the highest level
and clearly framed to solicit media attention or, perhaps, are simply politically motivated. There is
absolutely no merit to these allegations. Period.” Doe’s suit claims that this statement is libelous.
The only reason I can think of for including such a seemingly absurd claim (how can you libel
someone who is anonymous?) is that it’s not time-barred. The rest of the complaint probably is.
The alleged incidents took place in 1994—22 years ago. The complaint claims that Doe didn’t come
forward because she was “unrelentingly threatened by each defendant that, were she ever to reveal
any of the details of the sexual and physical abuse caused to her by defendants, plaintiff and her
family would be physically harmed if not killed.”
But Epstein in 2008 was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Why couldn’t she have come forward
then?
That’s not the only problem with the case.
I wrote about the suit when it was first filed in LA with great skepticism—“an anonymous stink
bomb,” I called it.
In large part, I was dubious because the person filing the complaint, “Katie Johnson,” claimed her
only past work experience was as a freelance model. And yet her pro se complaint was perfectly
formatted, with proper margins and numbering; it correctly cited statutes, got the venue and
jurisdiction correct and contained no typos.

It looked more to me like the secret handiwork of a lawyer intent on smearing Trump.
If so, however, there was no way to hold anyone accountable. The phone number provided was
disconnected and Johnson’s address was an abandoned, foreclosed house.
The allegations in the latest complaint by “Jane Doe” are the same, albeit with fewer lurid details and
no explanation why she is no longer Katie Johnson. But the biggest difference is that she’s got
lawyers now.
In addition to Mason, “Jane Doe” is represented—improbably—by New Jersey patent litigator
Thomas Meagher, the managing partner of nine-lawyer IP boutique Meagher Emanuel Laks Goldberg
& Liao.
Mason and Meagher did not respond to requests for comment.
Campaign finance records show that Mason gave $2,000 to Hillary Clinton in February. Meagher
during this election cycle has donated to Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush. He has
never given money to a Democrat, according to Open Secrets data.
So is the suit for real? Or is it an especially dirty way to attack Donald Trump?
There’s a You Tube video of the plaintiff, with her faced blurred and her voice distorted, where she
recounts the rape. Under these conditions, it’s impossible to tell if she’s credible or not.
The complaint also includes an affidavit from “Joan Doe,” a school friend who said the plaintiff told
her about the rapes in 1994, and from “Tiffany Doe,” who said she recruited the plaintiff to come to
Epstein’s parties and witnessed the sexual assaults. So perhaps more evidence will emerge to bolster
Jane Doe’s claims.
On the other hand, if the complaint is determined to be without merit, Mason and Meagher could be
sanctioned by the court for filing a frivolous lawsuit.
Or Trump could respond like Alan Dershowitz, who was also accused of sexual misconduct with a
minor in connection with Epstein. The Harvard Law School professor said lawyers for the accuser
acted unethically and fabricated the allegations; in turn, they sued him for defamation. The case
settled earlier this year on undisclosed terms.
In the Trump case, U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams set an initial conference for Dec. 16. The real
question: if Clinton wins, will this case simply disappear?

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021195.txt,"Until finally he called my cell phone later in the afternoon, relief swept
over me when I heard his voice on the other end. “Thank God you called,
I have been so worried about you, are you alright?” I jumped in without
letting him get past saying “Hello”. “Yeah, I’m fine. Ritchie told me you
called his house looking for me yesterday and gave me shit for it saying
you were upset or something, what’s up?” I knew I would have to be
delicate about asking what happened to Adam, thinking he’d be a mess
over it. “T heard from Marcus that something happened to Adam and I got
worried about you, what is going on?” T.J sounded scared, for what
reasons were beyond my knowledge but I was going to find out, he
replied ‘1 don’t want to talk about it over the phone. Are you in town so
we can meet up or something?” It was obvious | wanted him to know that
I was more than willing to lend my shoulder for his problems. “I’m home
now if you want to come over whenever you feel like it.” He didn’t
hesitate in taking me up on the offer. ““ But 1 won’t be able to get there
until later, I’m downtown at Ritchie’s place unless you want to come pick
me up.”

It was more of a request than a favor to myself which is what he was
making it out to sound like, knowing him all to well 1 didn’t make a fuss
of his ill-contemplated attributes. I got the address off him and made my
way into the ugliness of the not so dazzling parts of the Palm Beaches
downtown area. Rolling up my windows and locking the doors to my
truck | nervously drove through the rough streets trying to find Ritchie’s
apartment complex. Knowing all too well the history of the area, it’s not a
place a lone white girl in a nice truck wants to be seen, many reports of
the locals rushing up to a vehicles with a weapon demanding money,
cars, Or just angry and out to hurt someone. I was speeding through the
streets wanting to get out of there as quick as | could. A sad world we live
in with so much hurt everywhere you look and nobody wanting to do
anything about it, just accepting the hopelessness of never being able to
achieve anything more than what our civilization has succumbed to.
Being among one of those people, we were similar in so many ways.
Only separated by our own personal fears and the different direction they
pulled us into.

I drove straight through the open gates at the entrance to the complex
and parked on the gutter in front of Ritchie’s block of units. A crowd of
people stood outside the blocks I was entering. Being hit on and offered
drugs simultaneously my cheeks went flush and I put my head down not
saying a word. Walking up the corridors of the staircase looked like a
scene out of a horror flick. Graffiti covered the peeling of green paint on
the walls and the pungent stench of something rotting, only to the worst
of my imagination, filled my nostrils. I could hear babies screaming

through the thin walls and trying to find the unit number was difficult
from the sporadic flickering of the fluorescent lights above me.

At last I found Ritchie’s one, quite astonished with myself that I even
made it this far. I had to knock loudly on the door a few times before a
young girl answered the door with eyeliner bleeding down from her eyes,
her jet black hair was strung out and a mess and she looked off her face
on some hard drug. She had only her bra and a short skirt on to cover her
private areas and a cigarette hung out of her mouth to complete the full
picture of terrible state she was in. She looked me down with contempt
and snubbed at me “What do you want?” I maintained my politeness and
told her T.J was expecting me. She opened the door and walked away,
leaving me by myself to venture through looking for T.J.

Passing through the kitchen it looked like a hospital lab with syringes on
the counter tops and medicine containers lying around everywhere.
Minding my steps through the dirty house, I walked to the back to the
living room and found T.J in a K-Hole strung out on a filthy couch.
“Hey...there” he acknowledged me with a giant smile spread across his
face. He probably didn’t even know who | was from the dreadful state he
was in. My first look at him in months and I was in utter shock. My jaw
must have dropped to the floor at the very sight of him. Never seeing him
so skinny and unhealthy looking | took pity and wanted to help him
before things got even worse and he ended up like Adam, dead.

“T J, hey buddy its Jenna, remember | was coming to pick you up
today. You don’t look so good, what are you doing so messed up?” I
don’t think he could even understand what I was even saying because he
could only reply by giggling and rolling over, patting the couch as if it
were a fluffy animal. I stood over him now and raised my voice so he’d
know I was serious and snap out of it a bit. “Get Up T.J, Now!” I ushered
at him to get off the couch, repeating myself a few times over and with no
response | knew [ had to get physical. Rolling him back over to face me
again { smacked his face hard and I’m sure it stung but I got the reaction |
had wanted. He sat up and looked at me confused.

At least now he was able to focus on my words requesting him to come
with me. He was getting up from the couch and stumbling around before
falling down to the floor again. Putting his arm around my neck and

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025099.txt,"Although in the tourism sector there is an evident possibility of making money in Cuba,
it’s doubtful that the North American hotel industry, almost all present on the Stock
Exchange, subject to North American legislation and union pressure, would lend itself to
collaborating with the Cuban counter-intelligence by facilitating eavesdropping/wire-
tapping and clandestine filming inside hotel installations, such as today occurs in Melia
and other European chains, violating even Cuban law which supposedly defends the
inviolability of privacy. American lawyers are very clear about the high price German
companies had to pay when they associated themselves with Nazism, as occurred with
Volkswagen and Bayer.

Even though this is not a matter of investing in a country living under a dictatorship, but
rather of associating oneself with a dictatorial government in order to exploit workers
and companies, it’s very possible that, whenever the opportunity presents itself, those
businessmen linked to the Cuban government are going to be accused in court because
of the confiscation of 94% of the salary through the exchange of dollars for pesos and
other violations of the rules of the International Labor Organization. Workers’ claims
will be very high, and there are American law firms willing to bring them in exchange for
a percentage of whatever is eventually received.

Lastly, two articles of the Cuban constitution profile the inflexibly Communist nature of
the regime, and become a permanent threat against foreign investors. Article 5: The
Communist Party of Cuba, Marti-inspired and Marxist-Leninist, organized vanguard of
the Cuban nation, is the superior directing force of society and the State. Article 62:
None of the liberties recognized to citizens may be exercised against what is established
in the Constitution and laws, or against the decision of the Cuban people to build
socialism and communism. The violation of this principle is punishable.

relation to the timeline of the first dissident message, I’d say we’re around the year 1988,
when raising the Soviet-occupation topic was no longer a career-ending move but you
still had to somewhat hedge your position. I hear similar hedging now—statements like,
“Tm not concerned about superintelligent AI, but there are some real ethical issues in
increased automation,” or “It’s good that some people are researching AI risk, but it’s not
a short-term concern,” or even the very reasonable sounding, “These are small-
probability scenarios, but their potentially high impact justifies the attention.”

As far as message propagation goes, though, we are getting close to the tipping
point. A recent survey of AI researchers who published at the two major international AI
conferences in 2015 found that 40 percent now think that risks from highly advanced AI
are either “an important problem” or “among the most important problems in the field.””°

Of course, just as there were dogmatic Communists who never changed their
position, it’s all but guaranteed that some people will never admit that AI is potentially
dangerous. Many of the deniers of the first kind came from the Soviet nomenklatura;
similarly, the AI-risk deniers often have financial or other pragmatic motives. One of the
leading motives is corporate profits. Al is profitable, and even in instances where it isn’t,
it’s at least a trendy, forward-looking enterprise with which to associate your company.
So a lot of the dismissive positions are products of corporate PR and legal machinery. In
some very real sense, big corporations are nonhuman machines that pursue their own
interests—interests that might not align with those of any particular human working for
them. As Wiener observed in Zhe Human Use of Human Beings: “When human atoms
are knit into an organization in which they are used, not in their full right as responsible
human beings, but as cogs and levers and rods, it matters little that their raw material is
flesh and blood.”

Another strong incentive to turn a blind eye to the AI risk is the (very human)
curiosity that knows no bounds. “When you see something that is technically sweet, you
go ahead and do it and you argue about what to do about it only after you have had your
technical success. That is the way it was with the atomic bomb,” said J. Robert
Oppenheimer. His words were echoed recently by Geoffrey Hinton, arguably the
inventor of deep learning, in the context of AI risk: “I could give you the usual
arguments, but the truth is that the prospect of discovery is too sweet.”

Undeniably, we have both entrepreneurial attitude and scientific curiosity to thank
for almost all the nice things we take for granted in the modern era. It’s important to
realize, though, that progress does not owe us a good future. In Wiener’s words, “It is
possible to believe in progress as a fact without believing in progress as an ethical
principle.”

Ultimately, we don’t have the luxury of waiting before all the corporate heads and
AI researchers are willing to concede the AI risk. Imagine yourself sitting in a plane
about to take off. Suddenly there’s an announcement that 40 percent of the experts
believe there’s a bomb onboard. At that point, the course of action is already clear, and
sitting there waiting for the remaining 60 percent to come around isn’t part of it.

patterns among natural language concepts are given in Figures 15.5 and 15.6. Just for fun,
Figure 15.7 shows one person’s attempt to draw a heterarchical graph of the main concepts
in one of Douglas Hofstadter’s books. Naturally, real concept heterarchies are far more large,
complex and tangled than even this one.

In CogPrime, ECAN enforces heterarchy via building SymmetricHebbianLinks, and PLN
by building SimilarityLinks, IntensionalSimilarityLinks and ExtensionalSimilarityLinks. Fur-
thermore, these various link types reinforce each other. PLN control is guided by importance
spreading, which follows Hebbian links, so that a heterarchical Hebbian network tends to cause
PLN to explore the formation of links following the same paths as the heterarchical Hebbian-
Links. And importance can spread along logical links as well as explicit Hebbian links, so that
the existence of a heterarchical logical network will tend to cause the formation of additional
heterarchical Hebbian links. Heterarchy reinforces itself in autopoietic attractor style even
more simply and directly than heterarchy.

Banias, the Syrians’ base in the north of the Golan, toward Quneitra, their main
headquarters. That meant taking a longer route, beginning with a climb onto a
plateau about 200 feet high and crossing the Banias River toward the Syrian
base.

We had nearly three weeks for our final preparations. After two years of
sayeret training, I was confident that, physically, we would be up to the task.
But even without the obvious jitters emanating from the kirva, I could not help
but be aware of the possibility, and the cost, of failure. Every evening, I would
stake out time to go through everything that might conceivably go wrong. Years
later, when I went to do my graduate studies at Stanford, I was exposed to
words of wisdom from a non-kibbutznik — Benjamin Franklin — which probably
best summed up what drove my planning for the sayeret’s first operation, and
the others that would follow. “Failing to prepare,” he wrote, “is to preparing for
failure.”

Running into Syrian soldiers was, of course, top of the list of potential
pitfalls. But land mines were also a danger. I got a map of the area from military
intelligence which, in theory at least, showed the location of mines all along the
edge of the Golan. But it had been compiled over a period of nearly two decades
on the basis of information from shepherds, smugglers and the occasional Arab
agent. Whenever they reported seeing the telltale combination of fencing and
yellow danger triangles, the place was marked. Once it was marked, no one in
intelligence headquarters dared erase it. The result was that the map now
showed an almost unbroken stretch of mines. And within the amount of time
that we had to get ready, there was no way of knowing which of the minefields
was still there.

The timing was chosen by the cycle of the moon. We wanted to cross into
Syria in as near to total darkness as possible. That meant the final days of
September. Unlike Tubul, who had been commanding the team from the
moment they had joined the sayeret, I’d been working with them for only a
couple of months. My deputy for the operation, Avi Telem, was also a
newcomer. But he was smart, steady and he had served in the Golani Brigade,
so he knew the terrain along the border.

Avraham could not hide his own nervousness as the operation drew nearer.
A week before we were due to set off, he asked whether we were planning a
further, full-scale exercise. When I said the final run-through was set for the
following night, in the Negev, he told me he wanted Meir Har-Zion to attend.

as European hub is unclear

While the UK has faced short-term challenges over low

interest rates (relative to the US), the Brexit decision
poses a threat to the long-term attractiveness of

the UK. Brexit is seen as a significant negative for
UK investment, and investment sovereigns with
European interests questioned the future of the UK
as an ‘investment hub’ for Europe, given uncertainty
over taxes on imports and market access. Liquidity
sovereigns also noted their concern that demand for
UK government bonds would drop, challenging the
liquidity of their holdings.

Despite this negative sentiment, UK allocations
remain relatively stable with stated declines
likely linked to currency fluctuations rather than
withdrawal, as demonstrated in figure 9. Furthermore,
the fall in value of the pound has led to a rally in UK
stocks as export-linked businesses benefit from more
competitive pricing. The low value of the pound also
allows UK asset managers to offer their services at
a discount to international competitors. This low
entry price into the UK represents an opportunity
for UK managers who can demonstrate local market
expertise and robust currency hedging processes to
international sovereign investors.

There has also been a demonstration of ongoing
sovereign commitment to long-term alternative
investments in the UK. Many sovereigns noted that
they were unlikely to cancel UK real estate assets
in the near future and there have been several
high-profile statements of renewed commitment to
UK infrastructure investments following the Brexit
decision, including Thames Water and Heathrow
Airport. However, respondents noted that these are
long-term investments which are unlikely to move
until the outlook of the UK as a preferred investment
destination (comparable to the US or Germany)
becomes clearer.

young accusers.

Mr. Lefcourt says that the police acted “outrageously” and that his client has been
wrongfully dragged through the mud.

“He disputes that he ever had sex with any under-age person or anything like that,” said
Mr. Lefcourt, whose clients have included Russell Crowe, Martha Stewart and Abbie
Hoffman.

Neither the police nor the state attorney’s office would discuss the case in detail. But the
police released a thick report on the 13-month investigation after the indictment was
unsealed in late July.

The police started investigating Mr. Epstein in March 2005, almost immediately after
they were contacted by the stepmother of the 14-year-old, who, according to the report,
was in a special school for students with disciplinary problems.

The girl, the report said, told the police that an older friend had “offered her an
opportunity to make money” and had driven her to Mr. Epstein’s house one Sunday. The
friend, identified by the police as Haley Robson, a local community college student, told
the girl to say she was 18 if Mr. Epstein asked, the report said.

The girl told the police that Mr. Epstein’s assistant had led her upstairs to a room with a
massage table and that Mr. Epstein had come in and told her to remove her clothes. She
said Mr. Epstem had masturbated as she massaged him, had pressed a vibrator against her
underwear and had given her $300 afterward.

In October, the police interviewed Ms. Robson, then 19, who told them Mr. Epstein had
routinely paid her to bring teenage girls to his home. The police then interviewed a total
of 5 alleged victims and 17 witnesses, many of whom told similar stories about what they
had observed or participated in at Mr. Epstein’s home. According to the report, at least
one said Mr. Epstein had engaged in intercourse with her.

Mr. Lefcourt, his lawyer, said one girl who told the police of having had sex with Mr.
Epstein as a minor had lied about both the sex and her age and had not shown up for
grand jury questioning. He also said Mr. Epstein had passed a lie-detector test clearing
him of any sexual involvement with under-age girls.

A spokeswoman for the Palm Beach police said that early this year, the police went to
Mr. Krischer, the state attorney, intending to apply for warrants to arrest Mr. Epstein.
Instead, she said, they were told that Mr. Krischer would convene a grand jury to
examine the evidence and decide what charges, if any, to bring.

Around that time, the police report said, Mr. Dershowitz met with prosecutors to share
information about the accusers, including statements they had posted on MySpace.com,
the social networking site, concerning use of drugs and alcohol. According to the report,
Mr. Krischer’s office then decided to delay the grand jury session for several months.
The Palm Beach police grew frustrated, the report said, and on May | the department
asked prosecutors to approve warrants to arrest Mr. Epstein.

Chief Reiter also wrote Mr. Krischer questioning “the unusual course that your office’s
handling of this matter has taken” and suggesting that Mr. Krischer disqualify himself.

Chief Reiter refused several requests to be interviewed, and his spokeswoman would not

working for IBM under IBM project manager Cathie Skoog at the NSF when my third trimester
pregnancy was sabotaged. The story of this sabotage and what followed is (briefly) this:

I've long-alleged that John and Avery Gunther (whose children | used to babysit) agreed to a quid
pro quo exchange of financial compensation for help destroying my credibility on behalf of IBM
against whom I'd filed a 2010 EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) charge and a
subsequent May 2011 civil suit.

Per the May 11, 2011 Complaint, McGuire v. John and Avery Gunther:

3. On April 6, 2011 Mr. and Mrs Gunther, with uncontrolled greed and total disregard for the rights
and feelings of Ms. Nadine McGuire as well as those of their children, AFG and XWG, maliciously
and with ill-intent, wrongfully completed and executed a Complaint and Motion for Preliminary
Injunction requesting formal protection against Ms. Nadine McGuire.

4. Over the course of the previous few months, Mr. and Mrs. Gunther, colluding with persons against
whom Ms. Nadine McGuire is currently furthering litigation, including but not limited to plaintiff's
mother, Pauline Scala McGuire, and from whom they received and/or have been promised to receive
monetary incentives, hid their relationships with said individuals, further lied about having those
relationships in direct conversation with Ms. Nadine McGuire and Court testimony on May 4, 2011,
and wrongfully completed and executed a Complaint and Motion for Preliminary Injunction against
Ms. Nadine McGuire in cooperation and collaboration with said persons, resulting in the issuance of
a Temporary Restraining Order against Ms. Nadine McGuire issued on April 6, 2011.

- Initial Complaint, 5/11/11, McGuire v. John and Avery Gunther, Case No.:2011 CA 003703 B, DC
Superior Court, Judge Gregory Jackson presiding

In regards to the suit against IBM (McGuire v. IBM, 1:11CV528, US District Court of Virginia), the
only suit in which Pauline Scala McGuire was listed as a defendant, the most important claim was
one of “assault” that led to the 2007 death of my son. Per the filing:

Plaintiff, Grace Nadine McGuire, realleges the allegations of paragraphs 1-65 hereof as if fully set
forth within and further alleges:

66. Defendant Palmisano's conduct in ascertaining the drug that was used on the plaintiff to end her
pregnancy and take the life of her child on April 22, 2007, constitutes an intentional touching of the
plaintiff by defendant Palmisano, and was undertaken deliberately and with actual malice towards
the plaintiff and her unborn child.

67. Defendant Skoog, Susan Horton and Scala's conduct in coordinating the circumstances, creating
physical proximity and the administering of the drug to the plaintiff that ended her pregnancy and
took the life of her child on April 22, 2007 constituted an intentional touching of the plaintiff by said
defendants, and was undertaken deliberately and with actual malice towards the plaintiff and her
unborn child.

... 69. As the direct and proximate result of defendant Palmisano, Skoog, Susan Horton, and Scala's

There is another problem with realism. Like it or not, the United
States is a revolutionary power. Whether our government is trying to
overthrow foreign dictators is almost irrelevant; American society is
the most revolutionary force on the planet. The Internet is more
subversive than the CIA in its prime. The dynamism of American
society is constantly creating new businesses, new technologies, new
ideas and new social models. These innovations travel, and they
make trouble when they do. Saudi conservatives know that whatever
geopolitical arrangements the Saudi princes make with the American
government, the American people are busily undermining the core
principles of Saudi society. It’s not just our NGOs educating Saudi
women and civil society activists; it’s not just the impact of American
college life on the rising generation of the Saudi elite. We change the
world even when we aren’t thinking anything about global revolution —
when Hollywood and rap musicians are just trying to make a buck,
they are stoking the fires of change around the world.

A revolutionary nation cannot make a conservative foreign policy
work for long. In the 1820s and 1830s Washington tried to reassure
the Mexican government that it had no hostile designs against
Mexican territory. But the American people were moving into Texas
and the US government couldn’t stop that movement or blunt the
threat to Mexico if it tried. In the same way today, the economic and
political activity of individual Americans and American companies is
changing the world in ways that make life much harder for
governments in countries like Russia, China and Saudi Arabia. We
can press all the reset buttons with Russia that we want, but the
Russian government will still notice that both US society and
sometimes the government are actively working to help foreign
subversives overthrow repressive regimes.

Republicans in Congress, he suggested, would shred that tradition
under cover of a debate that is only nominally about the budget. “The
fact is,” he said, “their vision is less about reducing the deficit than it
is about changing the basic social compact in America.”
Conservatives would and did object to his implication of
heartlessness, but not necessarily to his assessment of their ambition.
The Republican plan put forward by Representative Paul Ryan of
Wisconsin, the chairman of the Budget Committee, and adopted by
the House on Friday as its policy blueprint for the next decade
contains a substantial dose of deficit reduction but is really a
manifesto for limited government.

It would take big steps toward privatizing Medicare, slash upper-
income tax rates, repeal last year’s health care law, bite deeply into
nearly all federal programs and try to cap the size of government
relative to the economy. But it also imposes a self-consciously moral
judgment on the government’s role, suggesting that the same kind of
demand for added personal responsibility that was embedded in the
1996 overhaul of welfare should now be applied more broadly, to
food stamps, housing aid and health care for the elderly and the poor.
“The safety net should never become a hammock, lulling able-bodied
citizens into lives of complacency and dependency,” Mr. Ryan’s
budget proposal says.

William A. Galston, who was a domestic policy aide to President Bill
Clinton and is now a scholar at the Brookings Institution, said Mr.
Ryan deserved credit of a sort for addressing head-on the
implications of the Republican Party’s increasingly rigid antitax
posture, which since it took root in the late 1970s has put greater and
greater pressure on budgets and the social programs they support.

“It represents the first serious effort to begin to bring Republican
social policy commitments in line with their fiscal and tax
commitments,” Mr. Galston said.

Tap B (3230). Table 1 arrays the target Primary and Secondary Drinking Standards, regulated
MCLs, required sampling frequency, and laboratory analytical results for the November 14,
2008-collected water samples.

Appendix A contains the laboratory analytical reports from HSA’s November 14, 2008
sampling event.

COMPARISON TO RECENT CITY MONITORING PROGRAM RESULTS

The City’s most recent annual compliance monitoring event for Primary and Secondary
Drinking Water Standards was performed in June 2008. The sample of ‘finished’ water product
was collected at a sampling point (laboratory tap) at the water treatment plant. Analysis was
performed by the City’s FDOH/NELAC-certified, vendor analytical laboratory, Genapure.
Analysis yielded all target parameter results below method detection limits (MDLs) or less than
respective maximum contaminant limits (MCLs) per Chapter 62-550, F.A.C.

The City’s most recent quarterly routine monitoring event for Nitrate and Nitrite was performed
in August 2008. The sample of ‘finished’ water product was also collected at the water
treatment plant’s laboratory tap. Analysis was again performed by the City’s vendor analytical
laboratory, Genapure. The detected concentration of Nitrate was less than the MCL (10 mg/L).
The concentration of Nitrite was below the MDL (< 0.053 mg/L). Nitrate concentrations from
HSA’s November 2008 sampling event are lower than either result reported from the City’s
annual or latest quarterly sampling from the water treatment plant's laboratory tap. The
difference between these results is not relevant since the reported concentrations from the City
and from HSA’s sampling event are still less than the MCL.

Table 1 includes a comparative array of the City’s monitoring program results to the results
from HSA’s November 2008 distribution system tap sampling for the target Primary and
Secondary Drinking Standards.

APPLICATION OF DISINFECTION CHEMICALS, BYPRODUCTS, AND THE EFFECT ON
TASTE
To eliminate the presence of microbiologics, such as Coliform bacteria, the City applies
chlorine at the treatment plant to disinfect the processed supply water. This treatment process
results in the formation of chemical compounds in the potable water product known as
Disinfection Byproducts (DBPRs). The allowable concentrations of DBPRs in drinking water
are set as Standards in FDEP rule 62-550, F.A.C.

The latest quarterly (3-month) reporting period for the City’s weekly routine monitoring of
DBPRs (Total Trihalomethanes, TTHMs) ended September 2008. The samples of water

driving when she drove, refusing to pass when she pulled over. When Jane Doe ultimately drove
to her home, the “private investigator” then parked in his car approximately 25 feet from Jane
Doe house and flashed his high beam lights intermittently into the home. Even more
threateningly, at about 10:30 p.m., when Jane Doe fled her home in the company of a retired
police officer employed by Jane Doe’s counsel, the “private investigator” attempted to follow
Jane Doe despite a request not to do so. The retired officer successfully took evasive action and

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030187.txt,"﻿Remembering Lenny Bruce

     August 3rd, 2016 marked the 50th anniversary of groundbreaking comedian Lenny Bruce’s death from an overdose of morphine, while his New York obscenity conviction at Café Au Go Go was still on appeal. On that same day he received a foreclosure notice at his Los Angeles home.
     But it wasn’t a suicide. In the kitchen, a kettle of water was still boiling, and in his office, the electric typewriter was still humming. He had stopped typing in mid-word: “Conspiracy to interfere with the 4th Amendment const”…constitutes what, I wondered.
     Lenny was a subscriber to my satirical magazine, The Realist, and in 1959 we met for the first time at the funky Hotel America in Times Square. He was amazed that I got away with publishing those profane words for which other periodicals used asterisks or dashes. He had been using euphemisms like “frig” and asked, “Are you telling me this is legal to sell on the newsstands?”
     I replied, “The Supreme Court's definition of obscenity is that it has to be material which appeals to your prurient interest.” He magically produced an unabridged dictionary from the suitcase on his bed, and looked up the word “pruient.” He closed the dictionary, clenching his jaw and nodding his head in affirmation of a new discovery. “So,” he observed, “it’s against the law to get you horny.”
     When we were about to leave the room, he stood in the doorway. “Did you steal anything?” he asked furtively. I took my watch out of my pocket since I didn't like to wear it on my wrist, and without saying a word I placed it on the bureau. Lenny laughed one loud staccato “Ha” and kissed me on the forehead.
     We developed a friendship integrated with stand-up comedy.	In his act Lenny had broken through traditional stereotypical jokes about airplane food, nagging wives, Chinese drivers, annoying mothers-in-law. Instead he weaved his taboo-breaking targets--teachers' low salaries versus show-business celebs, religious leaders’ hypocrisy, cruel abortion laws, racial injustice, the double standard between illegal and prescription drugs--into stream-of-consciousness vignettes.
     In each succeeding performance, he would sculpt and re-sculpt his concept into a theatrical context, experimenting from show to show like a verbal jazz musician. Audience laughter would sometimes turn into clapping for the creative process itself. “Please don't applaud,” he’d request. “It breaks my rhythm.” 
     Lenny was writing an autobiography--How to Talk Dirty and Influence People--which Playboy planned to serialize, then publish as a book, and they hired me as his editor. We met in Atlantic City, where he was taking Delaudid for lethargy, and he sent a telegram to a contact, with a phrase--DE LAWD IN DE SKY--as a code to send a doctor's prescription.
     At a certain point he was acting paranoid and demanded that I take a lie-detector test, and I was paranoid enough to take him literally. I couldn't work with him if he didn't trust me. We got into an argument, and I left.
     He sent a telegram that sounded like we were on the verge of divorce. “WHY CAN'T IT BE THE WAY IT USED TO BE?” he wrote. I agreed to try again, and in 1962 I flew to Chicago. Lenny was performing at the Gate of Horn, where he was asking the whole audience to take a lie-detector test.
     Lenny was intrigued by the implications of an item in The Realist, an actual statement by Adolf Eichmann that he would have been “not only a scoundrel, but a despicable pig” if he hadn't carried out Hitler's orders. Lenny wrote a piece for The Realist, “Letter From a Soldier's Wife,” namely Mrs. Eichmann pleading for compassion to spare her husband's life.
     Lenny had been reading a study of anti-Semitism by Jean-Paul Sartre. Now, on stage, giving credit to Thomas Merton's poem about the Holocaust, he requested that all the lights go off except one dim blue spot. Then he began speaking with a German accent:
    My name is Adolf Eichmann. And the Jews came every day to what they thought would be fun in the showers. People say I should have been hung. Nein. Do you recognize the whore in the middle of you–that you would have done the same if you were there yourselves? My defense: I was a soldier. I saw the end of a conscientious day's effort. I watched through the portholes. I saw every Jew burned and turned into soap.

    Do you people think yourselves better because you burned your enemies at long distance with missiles without ever seeing what you had done to them? Hiroshima auf Wiedersehen. [German accent ends.] If we would have lost the war, they would have strung Truman up by the balls, Jim. Are you kidding with that? Not what kid told kid told kid. They would just schlep out all those Japanese mutants. “Here they did; there they are.” And Truman said they'd do it again. That's what they should have the same day as Remember Pearl Harbor. Play them in unison.

     Lenny was arrested for obscenity that night. One of the items in the Chicago police report complained: “Then talking about the war he stated, ‘If we would have lost the war, they would have strung Truman up by the balls.’” The cops also broke open Lenny's candy bars, looking for drugs. They checked the IDs of audience members, including George Carlin, who told the cops, “I don’t believe in IDs.”  Then they arrested him for disorderly conduct, dragged him along by the seat of his pants and hoisted him into the police wagon. 
     “What are you doing here?” Lenny asked. 
     “I didn’t want to show them my ID.”
      “You schmuck.”
     Lenny was released on bail, but the head of the Vice Squad warned the Gate of Horn manager: “If this man ever uses a four-letter word in this club again, I'm going to pinch you and everyone in here. If he ever speaks against religion, I'm going to pinch you and everyone in here. Do you understand? You've had good people here. But he mocks the pope--and I'm speaking as a Catholic--I'm here to tell you your license is in danger. We're going to have someone here watching every show.”
And indeed, the Gate of Horn's liquor license was suspended. There were no previous allegations against the club, and the current charge involved neither violence nor drunken behavior. The only charge pressed by the city prosecutor was Lenny Bruce's allegedly obscene performance. Nobody’s prurience was aroused, but that made no difference. After all, there wasn’t any law against blasphemy. 
     “Chicago is so corrupt, it’s thrilling,” Lenny said.
     Chicago had the largest membership in the Roman Catholic Church of any archdiocese in the country. Lenny's jury consisted entirely of Catholics. The judge was Catholic. The prosecutor and his assistant were Catholic. On Ash Wednesday, the judge removed the spot of ash from his forehead and told the bailiff to instruct the others to do likewise. The sight of a judge, two prosecutors and twelve jurors, every one with a spot of ash on their foreheads, would have all the surrealistic flavor of a Lenny Bruce fantasy.
     Since he often talked on stage about his environment, and since police cars and courtrooms had become his environment, the content of Lenny's performances began to revolve more and more around the inequities of the legal system. “In the Halls of Justice,” he declared, “the only justice is in the halls.” But he also said, “I love the law.” Instead of an unabridged dictionary, he now carried law books in his suitcase. His room was cluttered with tapes and transcripts and photostats and law journals and legal briefs.
     Once he was teasing his ten-year-old daughter, Kitty, by pretending not to believe what she was telling him. “Daddy,” she said, “you'd believe me if it was on tape.”
Lenny's jazz jargon was gradually being replaced by legal jargon. He had become intimate not only with the statutes concerning obscenity and narcotics but also with courtroom procedure, and his knowledge would be woven into his performances. But as clubs became increasingly afraid to hire him, he devoted more and more time and energy to the law.
     In less than two years, Lenny was arrested 15 times. Club owners were afraid to book him. He couldn’t get a gig in six months. On a Christmas day, he was alone in his hotel room, and I brought him a $500 bill. With a large safety pin, he attached it to his denim jacket. When he finally got a booking in Monterey, he admitted, “I feel like it's taking me away from my work.”
Lenny lived way up in the hills. His house was protected by barbed wire and a concrete gate, except that it was always open. He had a wall-to-wall one-way mirror in his living room, but when the sun was shining you could see into the room instead of out. He was occasionally hassled by police on his own property. One evening in October 1963, we were talking while he was shaving, when four officers suddenly appeared, loud and obnoxious. He asked them to leave unless they had a search warrant.
     One of the cops took out his gun. “Here's my search warrant,” he said. Then Lenny and the cops had a discussion about the law, such as the rules of evidence, and after half an hour they left. Lenny tried to take it all in stride, but the encounter was depressing, and he changed his mind about going out that night.
     When everything was quiet, we went outside and stood at the edge of his unused swimming pool. Dead leaves floated in the water. Lenny cupped his hands to his mouth. “All right, you dogs,” he called out. “Bark for the rich man!”--thereby setting off a chain reaction of barking dogs, a canine chorus echoing through Hollywood Hills. 
     We ordered some pizza, and he played some old tapes, ranging from a faith healer to patriotic World War II songs. “Good-bye, Mama, I'm off to Yokohama, the Land of Yama-Yama…”
     Back at the Café Au Go Go arrest in New York, Lenny had told a fantasy tale about Eleanor Roosevelt, quoting her, “I've got the nicest tits that have ever been in this White House…” The top of the police complaint was “Eleanor Roosevelt and her display of tits.” At the trial, Lenny acted as his own attorney. He had obtained the legislative history of an Albany statute, and he discovered that back in 1931 there was an amendment proposed, which excluded from arrest in an indecent performance: stagehands, spectators, musicians, and--here was the fulcrum of his defense--actors. The law had been misapplied to him. Despite opposition by the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, the amendment was finally signed into law by then-Governor Roosevelt, but to no avail.
“Ignoring the mandate of Franklin D. Roosevelt,” Lenny observed, “is a great deal more offensive than saying Eleanor has lovely nay-nays.”
On October 13, 1965 (Lenny's 40th birthday), instead of surrendering to the authorities in New York, he filed suit at the U.S. District Court in San Francisco to keep out of prison, and he got himself officially declared a pauper. Two months before his death in 1966, Lenny wrote to me: “I'm still working on the bust of the government of New York State.” And he included his doodle of Christ nailed to a crucifix, with a speech balloon asking, “Where the hell is the ACLU?
After he died, at a séance, his mother brought his old faded denim jacket. That large safety pin was still attached to it. And at the funeral, his sound engineer friend dropped Lenny's microphone into his grave before the dirt was piled on. Lenny's problem had been that he wanted to talk on stage with the same freedom that he had in his living room. That problem doesn’t happen to stand-up comedians any more.
     As for me, I’m working on my long awaited (by me) first novel. It’s about a contemporary Lenny Bruce-type satirist. Those scenes where my protagonist performs, I’ve developed onstage myself, although at times it felt like I was actually channeling Lenny, until the day that he said, “C’mon, Paul, you know you don't believe in that shit.” Well, this ended that wishful-thinking delusion.
I told my friend Avery Corman--author of Oh, God and Kramer vs. Kramer-- how I welcomed the challenge of writing fiction.
“But, you know,” I added, “it’s really hard to write. You have to make everything up.”
And he said, “Hey, listen, you’ve been making stuff up all your life.”
     “Yeah, but that was journalism.”


The Last Word: Yikes!

     When George Bush was elected president of the United States in 2000, it was due to the electoral college, even though his opponent, Al Gore, won the national popular vote.
     Hillary Clinton was elected senator that year, and she announced that the first thing she would do was to get rid of the electoral college.
     A few years later, as a columnist for the New York Press, I sent her a letter asking about the status of that promise. She didn’t reply.
     On November 8, 2016, a crooked businessman, liar extraordinaire, bragging pussy-grabber, make-America-white-again, anti-choice, anti-Semite, fake Christian, the rapist of a 13-year-old girl in 1994 at a pedophile party (she canceled a press conference one week before the election because of death threats if she filed a lawsuit), climate-change hoaxer, twitter addict, homophobic, apprentice politician, fucking fascist, and of course Vladimir Putin’s “useful idiot,” namely Donald Trump, who was elected as an insanely narcissistic dictator based on the electoral college (a rigged system), whereas his opponent, Hillary Clinton, won the national popular vote by almost three million individuals galore, to no avail.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030106.txt,"By Andrew Khouri

August 11, 2016

A federal jury decided Thursday that one of the Middle East’s most prominent banks did not commit fraud and
steal technology from an Irvine firm that sued it for half a billion dollars in damages after their partnership
collapsed.

Orange County company InfoSpan had alleged that Emirates NBD ended a partnership for a mobile payment
system because it didn’t want to share revenue and stole InfoSpan’s technology to launch its own service.

The Dubai-based bank, in turn, denied it stole or ever used InfoSpan’s technology. It argued that it cancelled
the partnership because InfoSpan couldn’t produce a working product and misled it into thinking it was an
established company, not one with little to no track record.

After deliberating for a day, the jury unanimously decided that InfoSpan did not prove its case of fraud and
theft of trade secrets.

InfoSpan had asked for $540 million in damages. An attorney for InfoSpan declined to comment on the
possibility of an appeal.

The verdict capped a two-week trial that involved dueling accusations of fraud levied by high-profile attorneys
on both sides, including the former White House counsel to President Obama.

At the center of the high-stakes battle was San Juan Capistrano resident and entrepreneur Farooq Bajwa and a
mobile payment system that he said would allow migrant workers in the Middle East to send remittances back
home through text messages.

Bajwa contended that InfoSpan, with support from outside investors, spent $87 million developing the
business and technology.

To launch the system, known as SpanCash, Bajwa partnered in 2007 with Emirates Bank, which is controlled
by the United Arab Emirates’ sovereign wealth fund.

It seemed the ideal collaboration for the Pakistani immigrant, who earned millions operating another Irvine
company that manufactured computer components in the 1980s and 1990s

The Gulf States rely heavily on migrants to work construction and other low-wage jobs, offering a ready-made
market for SpanCash. InfoSpan aimed to allow migrants to transfer money back home far more cheaply than
Western Union or hawala, a traditional Middle Eastern broker-to-broker money transfer system.

A study from McKinsey & Co., cited in court records, projected annual revenue of $3.5 billion by the deal’s
fifth year, with InfoSpan receiving more than $2.8 billion in fees.

But the relationship between InfoSpan and Emirates Bank soured and the bank cancelled the deal in 2009.

A few days later, Emirates filed a criminal complaint in Dubai against Bajwa and a partner alleging that they
defrauded the bank and misrepresented InfoSpan as an established business with a working technology.

Two years later, InfoSpan sued in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana and alleged that its technology was working
and that it delivered its source code to the bank on servers. Emirates ended the deal, InfoSpan said, to launch
its own mobile payment system after stealing InfoSpan’s technology.

In court, an attorney for InfoSpan argued that Emirates torpedoed the InfoSpan relationship because it abhorred
how much money it would have to share with the Irvine firm.

“They wanted SpanCash and they wanted the money,” attorney William A. Isaacson said in his closing
arguments Wednesday.

Isaacson — a partner with powerhouse law firm Boies Schiller & Flexner, chaired by high-profile litigator
David Boies — argued that the bank resorted to “pure extortion” in an attempt to get its way.

As a result of the bank’s criminal complaint, InfoSpan alleged Bajwa’s partner, Larry Scudder, was detained at
the Dubai International Airport and taken to a cell where he was locked in with 30 other men for 19 hours until
he secured his release by turning over his passport.

According to the lawsuit, Bajwa tried to resolve the situation but was told Scudder's passport would be
released and he could leave the country only if InfoSpan gave up ownership and control of SpanCash to the
bank.

Six months later, the bank withdrew the fraud accusations and Scudder got his passport back, but SpanCash’s
reputation was tarnished and it collapsed, Bajwa previously told The Times.

The bank disputed that it acquired InfoSpan’s source code or used it at any time.

before too long.

TB: What about Syria?

DP: Assad’s power is steadily diminishing and I cannot see how his
regime will remain long in power.

TB: Should the United States get involved there?

DP: No, Americans have no dog in this fight and nothing in the U.S.
Constitution requires us to get involved in every foreign conflict. Two
wretched forces are killing each other; just look at the ghastly videos of
the two sides torturing and executing the other. Listen also to what they
are saying. It’s a civil war involving the bad and the worse. I don’t want
the U.S. government involved. That would mean bearing some moral
responsibility for what emerges, which I expect to be very unsavory.

TB: So you are supporting the Obama position?

DP: Yes, though he reaches it with far more angst. Also, there appears to
be some serious, clandestine U.S. support for the rebel forces. The
September 11 meeting in Benghazi between the Turkish and the American
ambassadors was very curious. They are both based in Tripoli, hundreds
of miles away. What were they doing in Benghazi? Arranging for
American arms going via Turkey to Syria, 1t appears.

TB: How important has Israel been to the revival of Islam?

DP: It is a major factor in the neighboring states. But elsewhere, in
Morocco, Iran, Malaysia, it has minor importance.

TB: Since the “Arab Spring,” Israel seems increasingly beleaguered.
DP: Not really, not yet, though I agree that it will be more beleaguered
with time. Its neighbors are so consumed with their own affairs that they
hardly pay Israel attention. But once the neighbors get their houses in
order, Israel will most likely face new difficulties.

TB: You have questioned U.S. support for Islamic democracy, which
does seem naive.

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018584.txt,"have a problem with people choosing not to have sex... but I'm not sure how I feel about
actively convincing people not to have sex.

In America, I advocate for open, explicit, pleasure-affirming sex education. But that's a
radical stance even in America -- I'm not sure whether it's possible here! At least I'm
spotting a few allies, some in unexpected places: for instance, there's a great high-profile,
outspoken sex-positive educator named Agrippa Khathide in South Africa... who happens
to be a pastor. I'm starting to think there's room to do fascinating work here, creating
culturally appropriate sex-positive education.

Yet abstinence remains the only 100% effective tactic for avoiding HIV. As another
educator told me, I hate abstinence-only education more than anything. Seriously. But...
here, I think it's a necessary ingredient. Is it responsible for me to avoid promoting
abstinence? Even if marketing abstinence means that to some extent, I'll have to tell
people sexual exploration isn't worth doing?

I'm still feeling out my approach, but... what if the most effective way to fight HIV is to
align myself with values antithetical to free sexuality? Does properly doing my job
require me to promote a sex-negative agenda? Surely not. Surely there are ways to
promote sex-positive abstinence -- perhaps a Vibrators for African Women program...?
(This is a joke. Mostly.)

And that's just one facet of the broader question keeping me awake at night! Which is:
given a fatal, incurable sexually transmitted infection; given a population where, in some
groups, up to 40% test positive; given a society in which culturally appropriate messages
emphatically do not include my pro-sex, pro-queer, pro-kink approach to sex education...
what does being a sex-positive educator mean?

Maybe I can harvest clues from my own feelings, past and present, about abstinence:
clues for how to promote it compassionately, effectively and responsibly; clues for
locating my boundaries when I talk about it. And maybe I can harvest down-to-earth
advice from my relationship with Mr. Chastity, too. I can work from toxic masculine
norms he's had such trouble with, and examine how men in southern Africa might
likewise worry about abstinence -- if you think American men have tough definitions of
sexual manliness to contend with, then try living in a place where the big men have
multiple wives and over a dozen children. I also think it'll be hot to be bound against
going too far. Maybe I can learn how abstinence is fun, fun, fun!

Hey, at the very least, it'll give me a taste of what I'm telling everyone else to do.

KOK ok

further upside potential in financials (more details below). Our financials sector specialist thinks XLF could have another
20-25% upside given the many levers to the Trump Trade: less regulation, higher interest rates, higher vol, economic
growth, loan growth, etc. The asset sensitive regional banks are more of a pure play on a rates move but we view the
larger cap banks as having multi-pronged upside given the aforementioned points.

That said, given the velocity and magnitude of the recent move and uncertainty around the impact and timing of
Trump’s policies, we believe options offer better risk-reward than being outright long financials stocks here. With flat
call skew, “appearing” call spreads with upside knock-ins price well.

Bryan Rafanelli
Biography

“If party planning is a fine art, then consider Bryan Rafanelli a virtuoso”
WCVB-TV Boston

“The event planner of the year”
Town & Country

Bryan Rafanelli’s exquisite sense of style, attention to detail and ability to transform clients’
visions into unforgettable celebrations have made him a go-to planner for the nation’s most
exclusive and high-profile events. He has produced it all, from elaborate fairytale-themed
fundraising galas for Massachusetts General Hospital for Children to Chelsea Clinton’s “wedding
of the decade” to State Dinners hosted by President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle
Obama.

Rafanelli and his firm, Rafanelli Events, have a simple philosophy: every event is a unique
creative challenge deserving of a one-of-a-kind approach. “My team listens to what you’re
imagining and then comes back with an idea you never expected,” he says. “We hone in on
every last detail so we can always deliver clients the highest level of service.”

The media has taken notice. A recent feature in OUT magazine reads, “For a flawlessly executed
affair to remember, a behind-the-scenes mastermind juggles the details. If you’re lucky, that
person will be event planner Bryan Rafanelli.” And the headline of a recent New York Times
profile —For Wedding Planner, Obsession with Privacy— reinforces that Rafanelli is tight-lipped no
matter whom the client is, letting his work speak for itself.

Rafanelli has been named “Man of the Moment” by Town & Country (2010), a 2011 “Innovator”
and “Event Producer of the Year” by BizBash, one of OUT magazine’s “100 Most Compelling
People in 2010”, a “Trendsetter of the Year” by Modern Bride, a “40 Under 40” by the Boston
Business Journal and “Best in Boston” eight years running by Boston magazine. His events have
been highlighted in: The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, People,
New York, CBSNews.com, VanityFair.com, NewYorker.com and more. Rafanelli has also
appeared as an industry expert on regional and national television programs including: “The
Martha Stewart Show”, ABC’s “Good Morning America”, NBC’s “The Today Show” and as a
regular contributor on New England Cable News’ “Morning Show.”

Rafanelli grew up in a large Rhode Island family, his mother always finding reason to throw
parties for the people she loved. “The sense of community and of bringing people together to
have good time just for ‘good time’s sake’ has always been inside me,” he says. He launched
Rafanelli Events in 1996 as a three-person operation executing only a handful of events a year. It
has quickly evolved into a full-service event design, strategy, planning and production company
with more than 100 events annually in venues around the world. Headquartered in Boston,
Rafanelli Events also has offices in New York City, Washington, DC and Palm Beach.

KUNA : Yemeni FM: We are ready to go back to peace talks - Politics - 05/05/2017 
BRUSSELS, May 5 (KUNA) -- Yemeni Foreign Minister Abdulmalik Al-Makhlafi said Friday that the 
Yemeni government is adhering to the peace process and is ready to go back to the table to bring peace to 
Yemen as soon as possible and to save the people from more suffering. 
But the positive position of the government does not get any response by the revolutionaries who are still 
refusing the demands for peace or to accept any international peace efforts, he told the Kuwait news agency, 
KUNA, in an exclusive interview at the end of his visit to Brussels. 
Al-Mekhlafi said they went to our brotherly country Kuwait which hosted the meeting for four months last 
year. After the consultations the UN envoy presented the draft agreement and we signed it but the other side 
did not sign it, he noted. 
But after we left Kuwait and till now the revolutionaries did not undertake any steps proposed by the UN 
envoy, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed. We regret that peace is on hold due the desire of the revolutionaries to 
continue the war, he said. 
Al Makhlafi said that the government would continue to call for peace and hopes that the international 
pressures and defeats that the revolutionaries have suffered until now will make them respond to the peace 
efforts. 
We were hoping to return again to Kuwait for the talks and our Kuwaiti brothers welcomed the return of the 
two delegation in Kuwait in order to sign the agreement, he noted. 
The Yemeni foreign minister expressed his deep appreciation and thanks to HH the Amir Sheikh Sabah Al-
Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, to the Kuwait government and to HE the first deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister Sheikh Sabah Khaled al-Sabah who exerted great efforts during the Kuwait meetings. 
We look forward to return to Kuwait, and our brothers in Kuwait are rightly saying that we will welcome you 
if you sign the agreement and not to waste time. But it appears that the revolutionaries are not ready to respond 
to this step, he said. 
Al Meahlafi said he visited Brussels for two-days of talks with the Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders, 
European Commission officials and Members of the European Parliament to explain the situation in Yemen 
and seek support for the Yemeni government's peace efforts. 
He said the Yemeni government seeks peace based on the three references, the Gulf initiative, the outputs of 
the national dialogue, and the Security Council resolutions on Yemen, including resolution 2216. 
The Yemeni foreign minister called on the EU to condemn the revolution and the Iranian interference in 
Yemen, which is sending arms to the Houthi militias. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026083 
He also expressed his thanks to the EU for their humanitarian aid and for pledging the amount of 116 million 
euro (USD 127 mn) during the UN-sponsored donors conference on Yemen held recently in Geneva. (end)

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031123.txt,"asset globally where vols are up this year — and the one with broader consequences for neighbors (through EM Asian intervention
policy). Hence, this week's focus in our FX Markets Weekly on two other dimensions of the bearish yen view: what is the currency
worth if the BoJ successfully delivers 2% inflation, and how broad is the yen short.

° To those who believe in purchasing power parity (and we are not amongst them), USD/JPY could move to 100 on a credible
BoJ. Realizing these extreme targets requires Japanese participation in this yen move, since international investors could reach their
risk limits on yen shorts. So far domestics look fairly unconvinced. Japan has been posting net capital outflows (foreign purchases of
JGBs minus Japanese purchases of foreign bonds) since mid-2011, but the pace of those outflows has not increased since then-
candidate Shinzo Abe began calling for much looser monetary policy. Stay short yen on the possibility that locals join the move, but
rotate exposure. Book gains on a KRW/JPY one-touch, a USD/JPY seagull and CHF/JPY cash. Stay long NOK/JPY and re-enter
EUR/JPY (both in cash). Stay short USD vs a basket of AUD, RUB and KRW.

Commodities

° Commodities are up around 1% this week, with all sectors gaining ground. In Wednesday’s GMOS, we retained all our
previous positions. Our main trades are long Brent time spreads (long front vs. third futures contract), long industrial metals, long US
natural gas and short agriculture. Production losses in the North Sea should support our Brent trade, while the current economic
rebound in China should push industrial metals higher. US Natural gas should benefit from the ongoing switch from coal to gas for
power generation and 2013 should see the first slowdown in production since the boom began five years ago.

e The GSCI agriculture index has already reversed around 80% of its rise in summer 2012 as farmers have planted a much
larger area, which means a higher likelihood of much higher future supply. We stay short for now as we think this downtrend has
further to go. We are also long gasoil vs. Brent. Global inventories are very low and demand from Asia is picking up, consistent with
the economic data, which we expect to improve further over the coming months. An expected cold snap should also help push demand
higher through January

e We took profit on our long position in gold last Friday and year-to-date gold is down around 1%. We believe many investors
had bought gold over the past few years to hedge against the risk of “QE unlimited.” The recent FOMC minutes, however, have since
raised the risk of an early end to QE, reducing to need to hedge through gold. The risk is thus that a number of market participants will
reduce their gold hedges, pushing gold prices down further. We still like gold as a hedge against long-term inflation risks once global
growth returns to trend and we would look to reopen the position at around $1,550/oz..

TEXT-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031753.txt,"﻿Operation Chaos Lives
By Paul Krassner
If a psychologist testing you in a free association method said “Vietnam War deserters” you most likely would reply “Canada.” However, Matthew Sweet, the British author of Operation Chaos: The Vietnam Deserters Who Fought the CIA, the Brainwashers, and Themselves, would definitely respond “Stockholm,” as proven by his nonfiction book’s comprehensive research. By 1968, more than a thousand deserters and draft resisters had escaped to Sweden.                                                                                                                     
     Many of them formed a group named the American Deserters Committee.  That ADC might just as well have served it as insane inadvertently satire. For example, a few friends kept a woman in her in her apartment, playing Beethoven in an attempt to reprogram her brain. An individual insisted that the Beatles were created as an instrument of psychological warfare. And the author himself became to believe the genocidal ambitions of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth’s secret plot to start World War III. And now, for whatever purpose, Donald Trump has met the same Majesty Queen Elizabeth.                                     
     Back In January 1974, journalists and activists whistle-blowers revealed the truth that there was a takeover by the CIA of the United States. Indeed, Lyndon LaRouche, the leader of a growing cult, spoke as his longtime alias, Lyn Marcus, to the audience in a New York shabby ballroom. He began describing the second phase of a psy-war game designed by the CIA, conducted on four continents, turning some of their most trusted colleagues into killers, drugged and imprisoned, reconditioned their minds, erased their memories of the experience, and returned to their friends as unknowing vehicles of a murderous conspiracy.
     The American CIA was then to be performed at a secret facility near Stockholm, where Marcus explained how brainwashed candidates were hypnotized, subjected to electric shocks, forced to eat their own excrement, endure sexual humiliation, and tortured until they whined like puppies. Once they had been reduced to mental pulp, the programming began.
     A literal kind of programming, following the rules of the computer age. Numbers linked to functions. Infinite loops of coded instructions, drilled into the subject by repetition, violence, the application of electrodes to bare skin. Finally, cyanide pills had been secreted inside their bodies, in order to eliminate the killers once they had fulfilled their programs. 
     No wonder Sweet admitted, “If I were to die without finishing this book, then someone out there would undoubtedly set up a Web page claiming that I’d been bumped off, by either the CIA, the Swedish secret services, or the bizarre political group that had once counted many of my interviewees as its members—and would, by the time my research was concluded, come to regard me as an enemy infiltrator. And that was then I knew I’d been swallowed by my own story. Swallowed, but not brainwashed.” He’s still alive.
     Back in New York, at the National Caucus of Labor Committees, Marcus was the leader of Students for a Democratic Society. For better or worse, he was delivering a charismatic economics lecture to an enthusiastic SDS crowd. In 1968 that summer, they protested the Vietnam War at the National Democratic Convention in Chicago. The Yippies nominated a pig as a presidential candidate, and I started a rumor that we planned to drop LSD into the reservoir. And yes, Lyndon LaRouche decided to drop his alias into pure manure.
     He was an unlovable conspiracy theorist who ran for the U.S. presidency eight times. He played himself as a cartoon character in an episode of The Simpsons in which aliens kidnapped presidential candidates Bill Clinton and Bob Dole, Immersing them in tanks of bubbling pink liquid. Homer shouted, “Oh my God! Lyndon LaRouche was right!” And Saturday Night Live featured “Lyndon LaRouche Theater,” in which Randy Quaid played LaRouche, with a bald wig, bow-tie and spectacles, narrating melodramatic twists, conspiracies, and confessing “I am insane.”
*    *    *
     Not mentioned in the book, near the end of March 1981, I delivered a keynote address at the Youth International Party convention in New York. These were the latterday Yippies, originally launched as the anti-Yippie “Zippies” during the 1972 both conventions in Miami. I asked the audience a rhetorical question, “How would you like to be a Secret Service agent guarding Ronald Reagan, knowing that his vice president, George Bush, is the former head of the CIA?”
     Once again, satire would be outdistanced by reality. On March 30, the president was shot by John Hinckley in order to make a favorable impression on actress Jodie Foster so that he could take her bowling on a date. Ironicallly, Hinckley came out for gun control, and Reagan came out against it.
I was scheduled to perform stand-up at Budd Friedman's Improvisation comedy club in Hollywood in April. He asked me to try and get some advance publicity. On April 2, the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner quoted a dispatch from the New Solidarity International Press Service:
    A group of terrorists and drug traffickers linked to Playboy magazine met in New York City's Greenwich Village area and publicly discussed an assassination of President Ronald Reagan and Vice-President George Bush. The meeting convened by the Yippie organization, featured former Playboy editor Paul Krassner and numerous individuals associated with High Times magazine, Hustler magazine and the Chicago Sun-Times.

    In a statement this afternoon, national Democratic Policy Committee advisory board chairman Lyndon LaRouche urged that this information be made public at this time as a means of assisting government investigators pursuing the assassination attempt against President Reagan. Playboy magazine, as an international dossier released in the March 30, 1981, issue of New Solidarity indicates, is at the center of an international apparatus that has in the past been directly implicated in high-level political assassinations.

Playboy’s response: “Absolute, unequivocal nonsense.” And Budd Friedman said, “Paul, that's not exactly what I meant by advance publicity.” My show went fine, but in July, New Solidarity escalated the attack and published a whole dossier on me:
In the early 1950s, Paul Krassner was recruited to the stable of pornographers and “social satirists” created and directed by the British Intelligence’s chief brainwashing facility, the Tavistock Institute, to deride and destroy laws and institutions of morality and human decency. Among Krassner's circle of Tavistock iconoclasts, peddling smut in the name of humor and “creative expression,” were Lenny Bruce…

These people were taken seriously in certain quarters. LaRouche received enough campaign contributions to qualify him for matching funds from the government. And the U.S. Labor Party’s newsletter, Investigating Leads, was subscribed to by police departments across the country.
In fact, when two thousand demonstrators protested the construction of the Seabrook nuclear power plant in New Hampshire, LaRouche's private intelligence network briefed a state police lieutenant that the demonstration would be “nothing but a cover for terrorist activity”--the exact same phrase the governor would use to the media a few days before the rally.
Incidentally, I was never in England. Moreover, Tavistock…Tavistock…I just couldn't seem to remember anything about ever having been brainwashed at the Tavistock Institute. They must've deprogrammed it right out of my consciousness.
*    *    *
Although LaRouche and I both taught at the Free University of New York in 1966, we didn’t cross paths. One student said that “LaRouche presented the most credible, most articulate, and best-argued version of Marxist economics that I ever heard.” My class was titled, “Journalism and Satire and How to Tell the Difference.” My countercultural friend Ed Sanders—leader of the Fugs band and publisher of Fuck You/A Magazine of the Arts—taught “Revolutionary Egyptology.” In 1967, he orchestrated the levitation of the Pentagon. 
LaRouche and his followers spent the year 2016 snickering behind their hands at the Republican candidate for the U.S. presidency. The organization even recorded a satirical song suggesting that the candidate’s core constituents were mentally ill. The singer trilled: “He’s a festering pustule on Satan’s rump! Don’t you be a chump for Trump!” 
     But when Hillary conceded defeat, the tune changed. Suddenly, Trump was not, as had been previously thought, a maniac poised to legalize heroin and govern on behalf of Wall Street, but America’s best chance to defeat the British Empire and forge a new alliance with Russia.
It has been said that LaRouche’s wife, Helga, “keeps him on a tight leash.” She is a German political activist, and founder of the LaRouche movement's Schiller Institute, an international political and economic think tank, one of the primary organizations, with headquarters in Germany and the United States, and supporters in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Russia, and South America, among others. 
     Helga outlines the great potential for the world if a Russia, China and U.S. partnership develops to fight terrorism and develop the world economy. Trump’s successful meetings with China's president Xi Jinping and Russian President Putin is promising. However, that relationship will only improve if the American people step up to the challenge to ignore the British media campaign attempting to subvert his presidency, and fight to implement LaRouche's Four Law economic development program.
     Helga believes that only with the support of the population will Trump be able to fulfill his campaign promises to the American people to restore Glass-Steagall and rebuild the country. The Glass-Steagall Act was signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933 as the Banking Act, which prohibited commercial banks from participating in the investment banking business. Helga makes an appeal from abroad to the American people not to miss this great historic opportunity. Dictator Trump has evolved from FDR’s fireside chat to morning tweets. Feckless cunt, anyone?

The Problem

One suggestion put forward by Daniel Dennett is the creative process
is a two-part task — generate ideas, then critically assess them. I can, in
principle, make a program write out every possible book less than 500,000
words long. Provided I don't store the results this will not collapse the
Universe. This just leaves the problem of writing another program to
read all the output and ring a bell each time it finds some interesting
truth. This second program might be called an appreciation program.
Let’s examine this approach. I can write out a very simple program to do
this — provided I cheat and ignore the complexity of the term ‘something
interesting. In plain English: Count up from one until I get an interesting
fact, write it down and stop.

Loop i++ until i == (Something Interesting), Print i

This generates two problems. We need to make a program that
can tell if something is interesting and it will need to be fast because it
is going to be handed a huge amount of junk. Clearly I have a process
running in my brain that can determine if something is interesting, but it
is quite slow. It takes me an appreciable time to open a book, leaf through
the pages and declare it either junk or interesting. Leo Tolstoy had a
process in his brain that allowed him to create something interesting but
I want to prove he did not do this by generating random junk and sifting
through it. Let’s look at the mathematics.

We know simply counting sequentially through every number
would take too much time, but why not generate random numbers and
run our critical eye over them? Surely this would give a faster result. Let
us try with a short poem. How hard would it be to come across something
as simple as a four-line poem using this technique?

This poem, by the late Spike Milligan, is only 23 words long,
including the title, and I have a powerful computer. Wouldn't it be
possible to generate it using a computer? Unfortunately, no. We humans
don't have a good head for large numbers and this problem is much
harder than it appears. Let’s use playing cards to get a feeling for large
numbers.

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015823
"
IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018590.txt,"to pieces, and it's much harder to speak against condoms when funeral processions wind
through your neighborhood every weekend. Occasional religious educators claim that
promoting condom usage waters down their message and therefore makes anti-HIV
education less effective; but most churches I've encountered take a pragmatic, condom-
promoting approach. Indeed, one of the best HIV curricula I've seen so far is the
Channels of Hope workshop, created by the Christian organization World Vision and
designed to train church groups. It not only promotes explicit condom education, but
urges compassion towards sex workers and homosexuals. And it discusses why marital
rape isn't okay! I'd venture to say that the majority of liberal, secular sex education
curricula in the USA aren't as awesome.

Just the other day, I was surveying a bunch of kids aged 11-13 and they asked how to put
on a condom. Cursing myself silently, I had to admit that I didn't have any to show
them... at which point one child dashed from the room and returned minutes later bearing
both a condom, plus a rather splintery stick from a firewood pile. Condom distribution is
in full swing; I can think of three places to pick up free condoms within a ten-minute
walk from where I'm seated. Condoms are described in kids' textbooks, and condom
demonstrations are welcome in every school. Condoms are lauded by politicians, pop
icons, and religious leaders. Take any person off the street and they'll know the HIV-
prevention mantra: ABC -- Abstain, Be faithful, use Condoms. Yet condom usage rates
are still killingly low.

KK ok

Though I'm fishbelly-pale, I'm not great at wearing sunscreen, and I live in Africa. I try...
I mean, I kinda try... I mean it's so annoying to apply, and it feels gross! And this
notwithstanding the fact that I literally have ten bottles of top-quality, non-sticky, oil-free
sunscreen sitting across the room from me as I type this. On the other hand, I religiously
take my malaria prophylactic pill; I've noticed no side effects, and getting malaria would
really suck.

I recall one recurring conversation between myself and a former boyfriend, whom I dated
for years. We'd both had excellent sex education, and yet we used withdrawal as our
primary birth-control method. We did it even though we both had boxes of condoms
available. We did it even though neither of us wanted me to get pregnant, and -- though
I'm definitely pro-choice -- I wasn't sure I could bring myself to have an abortion. We'd
both been tested, and we trusted each other not to cheat, but that's some dangerous trust
to extend -- and we knew it.

One particular moment comes to mind: we were lying lazily in bed together, talking
about how stupid we were.

We should be more careful,” he said seriously.
We really should, I agreed.

Let's be more careful,” he suggested.

I nodded.

We weren't.

next $100,000 of taxable income for married filing jointly ($50,000 for others). The following is a simple example

for a pass-through entity.

EXAMPLE

H and W file a joint return on which they report taxable income of $200,000 (determined without regard

to this provision). H has a sole proprietorship that is a qualified business and is a “specified service
business.” W is an employee and receives only W-2 wages from her job.

H’s qualified business income is $150,000. 20 percent of the qualified business income is $30,000.
Because H and W’s taxable income is below the $315,000 threshold amount for a joint return, (i) the wage

limit does not apply to H’s qualified business, and (ii) the limitation applicable to specified service

businesses does not apply. H’s deductible amount for qualified business income is $30,000.

On their joint return, H & W would qualify for a $30,000 deduction, reducing their taxable income from
$200,000 to $170,000. That taxable income would then be subject to regular income rates.

While upper-income wage earners in high-tax states generally do not fare well under the Act, taxpayers with

substantial income from pass-through businesses should see a tax benefit compared with current law, since the

weighted average rate of business income would be approximately 30%. Capital gains, dividends, and other

preferential income from a business would not be considered “business income” and would continue to be taxed

at preferential tax rates.

Under the initial Senate version, the pass-through deduction was not available to trusts or estates. Under the Act,
however, trusts and estates can benefit from the pass-through deduction.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026683.txt,"Liquidity sovereigns

Liquidity sovereigns manage assets to stimulate
economies that are highly dependent on commodity
prices during a market shock. Due to the unpredictable
and sudden nature of outflows, liquidity sovereigns
have extremely short time horizons and prioritise
portfolio liquidity above investment returns. Despite
low yields of government bonds, liquidity sovereigns
are unable to seek higher returns from alternative
asset classes due to the inherent liquidity risk.

Development sovereigns

The asset and geographic allocation of development
sovereigns is driven by the requirement to encourage
local economic growth (rather than investment
return). Development sovereigns take large (often
controlling) stakes in companies of economic
significance in order to grow their presence in

the local market. While other sovereigns adjust
allocations to maximise their asset growth and yield,
development sovereigns consider their success

in economic metrics such as GDP growth and job
creation, working closely with their investments to
grow long-term strategic assets. This means that
development funds are relatively unreactive to
return shortfalls and asset allocation trends.

Central banks

Central banks are ‘lenders of last resort’ - managers
of a large foreign reserves portfolio to bail out
financial institutions of public importance. Due to

the importance of maintaining reserves to sufficiently
cover such requirements, preservation of capital

is of greatest importance. Central banks also have
high levels of public accountability and disclosure,
encouraging risk aversion through short time horizons
and highly liquid investments. While other sovereigns
invest in home market assets, central bank reserve
managers hold the majority of their assets in foreign
securities, increasing the importance of currency
exposure relative to other sovereigns.

Unlike sovereign investors, central banks have
objectives outside of reserves management, including
local market liquidity management and maintenance
of currency pegs. Since these external factors have
influence over the foreign reserves, in this study we
consider central banks separately from sovereign
investors. However, as many government bonds have
negative yields, certain central banks have looked to
invest in non-traditional asset classes (e.g. equities)
to preserve their capital, closer aligning their foreign
reserves investment strategy to that of sovereign
wealth funds.

Funding challenges
and the low return
environment have
unique implications
for each sovereign
segment.

with each. (Epstein’s advantage here, over traditional investment firms, is
that he was proposing to do this without needing to own the algorithm itself,
the manner in which many firms operate to the disadvantage of the quants.) I
knew paltry little about this and so rather found myself identifying with the
young women to whom Epstein was explaining the basic math and
mechanics. (Epstein demands a certain amount of pedagogical attention in
return for a wealth of information.)

Hefnerian prurience becomes quite businesslike: poised young women
in a mansion on the Upper East Side with various office responsibilities—
really not that different from any of the art galleries in the surrounding
neighborhood.

The Epstein house/office is, not unlike many nearby galleries, an
ultimate club, a private reserve, a place of shared and valuable
information—indeed, the kind of place, that, even for the most ardent
conspiracists, might seem a little too movie-like. And while it’s hard to
explain why, given the radio-active nature of Epstein’s disgrace, the rich and
powerful still beat a path to his door, it’s also notable in the fixed hierarchy
of who comes to whose turf, that everybody, when they went to see Epstein,
comes to him.

A week in late September, U.N. week as it happened, began, on
Sunday, at Epstein’s house with a colloquial for billionaires—Gates, TK,
TK, TK.

Epstein, preternaturally responsive to both the price of oil and to the
politics of the middle of East, entertained that evening a delegation from
Qatar, including Sheikh Hamad, the foreign minister. Hamad, indeed, lives
across the street in a similarly furnished house—he and Epstein have the
same decorator. Epstein, in his relaxed and amused demeanor, kept
prodding: “Why are you financing the bad guys? What do you get out of
that?”

The Qatarians, in some mild diplomatic discomfort, seemed most
worried that their bid for the World Cup might be compromised by bribery
allegations.

At 9:00 next morning, Epstein is joined for breakfast in the dining
room by Reid Weingarten, who’s represented among other fat cats in
trouble, Worldcom’s Bernie Ebbers and Goldman Sach’s Lloyd Blankfein.
Weingarten, horse, with a cold, and dejected, is just back from a failed
defense of former Connecticut Governor John Rowland. (Epstein: “You
actually believe he was getting fucked?” Weingarten: “From minute one.

World Affairs
Yes, Nukes: The Global Zero Utopia

Richard Perle

March/April 2011 -- There are many specters haunting our world, but
one is of our own making—the utopian vision of a world free of
nuclear weapons, the dream that has come to be called “global zero.”
The vision of the total elimination of nuclear weapons is a
postmodern version of an old idea, popular early in the twentieth
century, when Norman Angell’s The Great Illusion (reprinted in
1933) was required reading in intellectual and policy circles in the
United States and Europe. Seventy-six years before Barack Obama
was honored in Oslo, Norman Angell also won the Nobel Prize,
having come to prominence with the argument that global economic
interdependence rendered war futile and unprofitable and therefore
obsolete.

In the wake of the Bush administration, what lies in store for the
future of America's presence abroad?

Angell’s theory expressed the war-weary and wishful temper of the
time. Enthusiasm for achieving peace through international
institutions and legal constructs ran high in the period after the
disastrous First World War, its most fulsome expression being the
Kellogg-Briand Pact, named for its authors, an American secretary of
state and a French foreign minister. Ratified by parliaments around
the world (and by the US Senate on an 85-1 vote, with only
Wisconsin Republican John J. Blaine voting against), the pact sought
to deal with the problem of international aggression by simply
outlawing war. Less than two years after the pact entered into force in
1929, one of the signatories, Japan, invaded Manchuria. The world
“community’—that is, the rest of the treaty parties—did nothing.

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022764.txt,"Indeed, Roberts, with the Daily Mail being her prime outlet, emerges
as the most vocal accuser—and, in fact, the some total of the current story
and attention.

That is, there is no story without her and what is being billed as her
memoir of her “sex slavery” with Epstein, written ten years after the fact.
Along with the Dershowitz and Prince Andrew charges, Roberts puts, with
rather some narrative detail, both Clinton and Al and Tipper Gore on the
island—and in fact Clinton, apparently with the acquiescence of the Secret
Service, flying in a helicopter piloted by Epstein’s girlfriend, an amateur
pilot. Epstein’s lawyers say that not only have Clinton and the Gores never
been to the Epstein Island, but that there is easy proof of this in secret
service records, which would seem to make the memoir opportunistic or
hallucinatory fiction.

The FBI, in a recent filing, has argued that Roberts should not be
party to the suit against the government because she refused to cooperate
with the government in its investigation in 2007, hence has no standing as a
victim. (At the same time, the FBI included her on the list of 40 victims with
whom it mandated Epstein reach a settlement.)

It is hard to find a more hyperbolic intersection of media and lawyers
then in Epstein’s case.

Edwards, over the six years of his law suit, tries to depose Clinton,
Donald Trump, and Dershowitz—almost all of his targets coming directly
from the original Vanity Fair and New York Magazine articles about
Epstein.

In addition to Prince Andrew as a British hot button, first connected to
Epstein through Roberts’ interview with the Daily Mail in 2010, Clinton
takes on a new role as Hillary spoiler through his connection, real or
imagined, to Epstein and sex slaves.

Almost everybody identified in any story about Epstein is approached
by other media seeking to write about Epstein, often with financial
incentives.

No new stories or even new details emerge. Every aspect of the
current story is based on court filings describing events that may or may not
have taken place prior to 2007. It’s as though a kind of ground-hog day of
moral opprobrium, a desire to repeat and to savor a new the old details.

A recent Reuters story identified a charity that Epstein has not given
money to in 15 years that said if he does give again, they would give it back.

The world cleanly divides, with Epstein (and friends) behind secure
walls and the Mail and social media and upholders of new norms ever more

I grew up in Pennsylvania, bereft of any really meaningful
opportunities to experience severe weather, hurricanes, even
real deep snow. As a youth, I tried to impress friends and
girls with my home weather station and insect collection.
These efforts, among other factors, kept me well out of the
running for homecoming king. Naturally, I moved on toa
party school, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
to search for a better social life. But hating schoolwork, I
rushed through it, earning my MS at only 21. Then after some
aimless additional years in school I dropped out for three
years, working for the Air Force on nuclear winter computer
simulations and other cheery subjects. Returning to MIT,
Iearned my Doctorate and moved to Colorado to work at

the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) on
bistatic radar networks, a new type of weather radar system
that I had invented. However, after seeing real High Plains
thunderstorms close up, and tornadoes, I got distracted

and conceived of building a network of big, fast scanning
radars that could drive right up to tornadoes and fires, inside
hurricanes, and into other nice weather. The DOW program
was born, and I moved down to Oklahoma to be a professor
for a few years, chase tornadoes and hurricanes, file patents,
teach and write papers. In the middle of this, I traveled to Asia

on a research project and met my wife operating a weather
radar on an island off the coast of Hong Kong and conned
her into believing that Oklahoma was just like Hong Kong.
After receiving tenure and the implied lifetime sentence

at the university, I did the sensible thing: I quit and moved
back to Boulder and founded my own non-profit research
institution, the Center for Severe Weather Research (CSWR).
My wife and Irun CSWR, manage the DOWs as National
Science Foundation (NSF) Facilities, and conduct research
programs such as the VORTEX2 study and hurricane studies.
We have four young children who, so far, show no unhealthy
obsessive interests in tornadoes, hurricanes or radars. I’ve just
finished the VORTEX2 tornado study (http://vortex2.org),
which is the largest tornado research mission ever, funded
mostly by NSF, employing about 120 scientists and crew in
50 vehicles. We had 11 radars, 4 balloon trucks, UAVs, 40
deployable instruments, 13 mobile mesonets, photogrammetry
and microphysics teams, damage survey teams, basically
more of anything that used to study tornadoes scientifically.
Just imagine the lines for fuel and bathrooms in small-

town gas stations. During WWW, I'll be keeping a nervous
eye out for any hurricanes threatening to make landfall.

If a hurricane looms, I'll be leading my team into the eye.

other powerful persons. For example, Ghislaine Maxwell
is there with him on all of these flights and apparently
being involved in the abuse.

Indeed -- and so you -~ you have -- you
have that. You also start to see on the flight logs,
what to my mind are some very sinister things,
suggesting that the pattern is not just confined to sort
of, you know, the girls that are there in Florida, but
it -- it is extending more broadly.

Like one of the -- to my mind, sinister and
scary things on the flight logs is, we see, you know,
Virginia Roberts, who we know has been sexually abused,
and we see Jeffrey Epstein, and then we see on the
flight logs one female.

That's kind of an odd notation for a flight
log because, you know, typically, I understand the
flight logs, the purpose is, well, if something happens
with the flight, or there's some question about who was
on it, you want to know who -- who the person was who
was on the flight.

So, to my mind, when I started to see on
these flight logs entries like one female, I viewed that
as a potential device for obscuring the fact that there
was interstate trafficking of underage girls for
purposes of sexual activity. Serious federal offenses.

ESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS

But then that evidence extended, you know,
more broadly than that. The evidence also started to
show, again, if we talk just about flight logs, that
the -- that underage girls such as Virginia Roberts were
being flown internationally from, for example, Teterboro
in New York to -- to locations, just to pick one, you
know, for example, in London, where again sexual abuse
was occurring.

And so you started to put together this
pattern of criminality that was started in this -- you
know, I don't know what the right word is here. I don’t
want to -- I don't want to -- you know, you've heard
discussions of hyperbole and things like that, but we
have got this nest of -- of -- and I won't say snakes,
but we have this nest of criminals in Florida, but it --
it seems to be spreading to Epstein's mansion in New
York; it seems to be spreading to Ghislaine Maxwell's
flat in London, and -- and -- and it goes on.

So those are the kinds of things that would
have formed the -- the -- the basis, particularly when
you -- when you start to add in this fact: What the
Palm -- going back now te Florida with the Palm Beach
Police Department. What the Palm Beach Police
Department has -- had discovered was not a one-off kind
of event, you know, on one particular day, one

particular girl had been sexually abused.

What the Palm Beach Police Department had
discovered was brazen, notorious, repetitive activity
sometimes occurring as often as three times ina
particular day. And so that led me to believe that the
sexual activity that was going on in Florida was such
that someone who was a regular house guest there would

have immediately come to the conclusion that, well,

look, gee, there are these underage girls coming in here

and they -- they seem to be -- you know, they don't seem
to be here to be doing, you know, business activities;
they ~- they might be here doing other kinds of
activities. So those would be the kinds of things that
would -- would have formed the factual basis.

There are other things as well, but I'm sure
you want to ask other questions in addition to that. So
I'll stop there, but those -- that's -- I think gives
you a small flavor of the kind of evidence that, you
know, was form -~ undergirding the allegations that were
being presented here.

Q. ‘It sounds like you quite passionately believe
that there was strong evidence that Mr. Epstein had
engaged in sexual misconduct; is that right?

Chief Investment Office 
Capital Market Outlook from our Chief Investment Office 
delivers a balanced mix of macroeconomic insights and 
global market views, with in-depth analysis from the CIO's 
investment strategists and analysts. It offers timely 
commentary that can help you navigate markets and take 
advantage of emerging trends across the globe. 
This week's topics are: 
• Macro Strategy: Why 2%? — While Federal 
Reserve policy has always been focused on the goal of 
price stability, the specific meaning of price stability has 
been refined over the years from a general and non-
specified, vague concept to the current very specific 
quantitative definition of a 2% long-run average for the 
personal consumption expenditures deflator. We describe 
the evolution and rationale for the more specific target. 
• Global Market View: Global R&D: From Apollo, 
to Apple, to Alibaba? — The recent unfolding tech cold 
war between the U.S. and China will likely only accelerate 
the pace of spending on global research and development 
as the two parties vie for technological supremacy. China 
faces significant technological hurdles, while the U.S. 
needs to rethink and rebalance the role of public and 
private sector research and development spending. 
• Thought of the Week: A Golden Diversifier — 
Gold's recent outperformance versus the U.S. dollar has 
potentially triggered a bullish technical pattern. In our

view, the market's expectation for looser monetary policy 
together with recent comments by President Trump 
implying a desire for a weaker greenback have been 
tailwinds. In addition to these drivers, we view gold as an 
appealing diversifier in light of elevated geopolitical risks. 
However, a comprehensive trade deal between the U.S. 
and China would likely constitute a more significant 
headwind for the yellow metal.

Murtin A, Schmidt, Provost 
Maria T, 7Lihor. Vice President for Research 
Dear colleagues, 
We are writing to alert you to an issue that threatens all of MIT's federally funded research activities but that is often underappreciated. 
We're referring to the Trump Administration's proposal to put a 10 percent cap on indirect cost reimbursements to universities by the 
National Institutes of Health — an idea that is already beginning to be talked about for other federal agencies as well. 
An article explaining indirect costs and why they are important to MIT can be found in the most recent Faculty 
Newsletter: http://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/295/zuber.html. 
The Administration's proposed cuts to federal R&D agency budgets have rightly been met with consternation on campus. The indirect 
cost cap proposal is actually an even graver danger because it is easier for the government to institute, and it would do far-reaching 
damage that is harder to reverse. We need faculty and research staff to understand the devastating effects that capping indirect cost 
would cause to MIT and other research institutions. 
The indirect cost cap is easier to implement than a cut to the budget because the Administration can act unilaterally without 
Congressional approval. The proposed agency budget cuts are already running into strong headwinds on both sides of the aisle in 
Congress, and they cannot move forward without 60 votes in the U.S. Senate. The indirect cost cap, by contrast, does not attract the 
same level of attention because it is not well understood, and the Administration can simply impose a cap — at a single agency, or at all 
of them (since indirect cost reimbursement is fairly uniform across the government now). 
What would a 10 percent cap mean for MIT? A 10 percent cap on all federal agencies would cost MIT around $100 million a year. To 
put that in context, the financial crisis of 2008, where we saw a significant decline in endowment, required us to reduce spending by this 
same order of magnitude. Fortunately, the recovery of the endowment was relatively quick, and we were able to recoup some of that 
loss. In this case, the 10 percent cap is unlikely to be altered in the foreseeable future. Since this is a recurring cost, attempting to 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 029429 
recover this in the future through endowment payout would require on the order of an additional $26 in endowment. These indirect cost 
funds partially reimburse MIT for upkeep of research buildings and equipment, and literally keeping the lights and heating and cooling 
systems on. A portion of the money also pays administrative costs required to implement federal regulations and to provide staff who 
help apply for and monitor federal grants. 
A cap on indirect costs would directly affect research and researchers. If MIT failed to receive the federal funds needed to operate 
research infrastructure, we would need to limit the number of federal grants that the Institute accepts. It would be necessary to 
introduce a process analogous to under-recovery of foundation proposals to identify the indirect costs to support each federal grant. 
While we would seek other ways to raise revenues, we would also need to cut other expenditures (e.g., through layoffs, salary freezes, 
etc.), reduce the use of research facilities to cut operating costs, and/or to allow facilities to deteriorate. All of our peer institutions are 
considering similar steps. In short, a cut to indirect costs is a cut to research funding. And it's a cut that's more difficult to handle than a 
decision by a federal agency not to fund a particular project in a given year. 
The percentage of federal research funding that goes to indirect costs has remained relatively steady for decades, and there has been 
a federal cap on administrative costs since the 1990s. The Administration may hope that a proposed cap on indirect costs is seen as 
mitigating the impact of their proposed 22% reduction of the NIH budget. Although it may obscure this impact, in reality it will worsen 
it. The Administration is claiming that a cut to indirect costs will not cut research, but in truth without indirect cost recovery, academic 
institutions, including MIT, will not be able to afford to support current levels of federal grants. 
The MIT administration is working on this matter with the urgency that it deserves. Let us be clear that no one on campus should be 
blasé or unconcerned about the proposal to cap indirect costs. Capping these costs will negatively impact every researcher at MIT. 
Please let us know if you have any questions or comments. We will keep you informed as this situation evolves. 
Sincerely, 
Martin A. Schmidt

through his life was his personal cure, by transformative Grace, of a triad of self-
destructively sinful addictions: alcohol, gambling and promiscuity. Self-chosen and
self-declared, he now served this two and a half year old growing congregation of
over 200, mostly young, working families. The young men in attendance at the
warehouse church were in shirts and ties, very unlike the more casual garments of
even dressy occasions in Southern California at that time. Women were dressed
simply and modestly. Most of the children were in Sunday school in a small
neighboring store in the strip mall during the adult service. The few that
accompanied their parents were remarkably well behaved | was told that most

t

families tithed 10% of their income. They quoted Hebrews, “...king of the
righteous...to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all....” They believed that
their tithe would be returned manifold and the yellow Cadillac Deville served as
Pastor Carl Austin’s personal evidence. From these funds, the congregation
supported the pastor, his car, the rental expenses of the Sunday warehouse church
and an orphanage in a small Mexican border town. Some of these children, several
neurologically disabled, were bussed to the Sunday service for healing. They sat
together in a section in the front of the congregation and were the beneficiaries of
the second Sunday collection plate, passed around after the first one that was
designated for the church and its pastor.

The first Sunday sermon | heard in the warehouse followed several awkward
minutes of Pastor-directed warm up hugs of neighboring strangers while the choir
sang hymns. The songs were accompanied by instruments playing the melody in
unison sans harmony, and accented by the beats of two loud drums. As the volume
and pace of singing increased, | saw several episodes of ecstatic looks and fainting,
dying in the Lord and shouts of praise with upraised hands. The intermittent
elevation of the hands during prayer and song appeared to be spontaneous. | was
told that the arms were up as antennae, feeling the energy of Lord all around us.

The pastor’s topic was forgiveness. From Ephesians, “...let all bitterness, wrath,

anger, clamor, and evil speaking be put away from you, along with all malice... be

kind to one another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, just as God in Christ

tions. When they discussed Snowden’s legal situation in America,
Snowden expressed an interest in obtaining some form of amnesty
from prosecution. Wizner was willing to attempt to explore making
a possible deal with the Department of Justice, but it would not be an
easy task, especially if Snowden had turned over NSA documents to
a foreign power.

Even to argue that Snowden was merely an NSA whistle-blower
presented a serious challenge for Wizner. The ACLU had been
involved with previous NSA whistle-blowers, but Snowden’s case
differed from those cases in important ways. Those whistle-blowers
had not intentionally taken any NSA documents. Snowden, on the
other hand, had not only taken a large number of NSA documents
but also released tens of thousands of these top secret files to jour-
nalists based in Germany and Brazil, as well as to other unauthor-
ized recipients. In addition, the Whistleblower Protection Act, passed
by Congress in 1989, does not exempt an insider, such as Snowden,
who signs a secrecy oath from the legal consequences of disclos-
ing classified documents to journalists or other unauthorized people.

© Consequently, getting some form of amnesty for Snowden required ©
bolstering his image as a person taking personal risks to fight for
America. But if Snowden had taken even a single top secret docu-
ment to Russia, it would strengthen the case in the court of public
opinion that he had stolen communications intelligence secrets with
the intent to damage the United States, which under the provisions
of federal law could be considered espionage. In this regard, Kucher-
ena’s disclosure was extremely damaging to Snowden’s position, and
Snowden had, after all, already found refuge in Russia. Snowden
had two options, according to Wizner, the “first is to be where he is
in Russia. And the second is to be in a maximum security prison cell,
cut off from the world.” These, of course, would be the options of
any espionage defector who fled to Russia.

One way to mitigate the damage was for Snowden to substitute
a new narrative. Wizner took it upon himself to screen potential
journalists and other outlets for Snowden. He told a reporter for
The New York Times that, except for Oliver Stone, all individu-
als who have “met with Snowden have just gone through me, and
we've hooked it up.” Nor did he limit his extraordinary control to

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016319.txt,"When it comes to real robots helping real people, the standard definition of AI
fails us, for two fundamental reasons: First, optimizing the robot’s reward function in
isolation is different from optimizing it when the robot acts around people, because
people take actions too. We make decisions in service of our own interests, and these
decisions dictate what actions we execute. Moreover, we reason about the robot—that is,
we respond to what we think it’s doing or will do and what we think its capabilities are.
Whatever actions the robot decides on need to mesh well with ours. This is the
coordination problem.

Second, it is ultimately a human who determines what the robot’s reward function
should be in the first place. And they are meant to incentivize robot behavior that
matches what the end-user wants, what the designer wants, or what society as a whole
wants. I believe that capable robots that go beyond very narrowly defined tasks will need
to understand this to achieve compatibility with humans. This is the va/ue-alignment
problem.

The Coordination Problem: People are more than objects in the environment.

When we design robots for a particular task, it’s tempting to abstract people away. A
robotic personal assistant, for example, needs to know how to move to pick up objects, so
we define that problem in isolation from the people for whom the robot is picking these
objects up. Still, as the robot moves around, we don’t want it bumping into anything, and
that includes people, so we might include the physical location of the person in the
definition of the robot’s state. Same for cars: We don’t want them colliding with other
cars, so we enable them to track the positions of those other cars and assume that they’ ll
be moving consistently in the same direction in the future. A human being, in this sense,
is no different to a robot from a ball rolling on a flat surface. The ball will behave in the
next few seconds the same way it behaved in the past few; it keeps rolling in the same
direction at roughly the same speed. This is of course nothing like real human behavior,
but such simplification enables many robots to succeed in their tasks and, for the most
part, stay out of people’s way. A robot in your house, for example, might see you
coming down the hall, move aside to let you pass, and resume its task once you’ve gone
by.

As robots have become more capable, though, treating people as consistently
moving obstacles is starting to fall short. A human driver switching lanes won’t continue
in the same direction but will move straight ahead once they’ ve made the lane change.
When you reach for something, you often reach around other objects and stop when you
get to the one you want. When you walk down a hallway, you have a destination in
mind: You might take a right into the bedroom or a left into the living room. Relying on
the assumption that we’re no different from a rolling ball leads to inefficiency when the
robot stays out of the way if it doesn’t need to, and it can imperil the robot when the
person’s behavior changes. Even just to stay out of the way, robots have to be somewhat
accurate at anticipating human actions. And, unlike the rolling ball, what people will do
depends on what they decide to do. So to anticipate human actions, robots need to start
understanding human decision making. And that doesn’t mean assuming that human
behavior is perfectly optimal; that might be enough for a chess- or Go-playing robot, but
in the real world, people’s decisions are less predictable than the optimal move in a board
game.

Al ATTACKS ON SOURCES AND IDENTITY

Messaging and persuasion promises to be amplified by the use of simulated yet believable,
realistic, yet synthetic audio, photos, and even video that make believable, persuasive content to
the next level. Beyond influencing citizens and affecting democracy, such content, including false
signaling, can be injected in sequences with careful timing so as to influence leaders (or machines
themselves over time) to create crises, or even escalations to frank warfare. So, messaging and
persuasion promises to be assisted and amplified by the use of simulated yet believable, realistic,
yet synthetic content, audio, photos, and even video that make believable, persuasive content to
the next level. Over the several decades, extrapolations of research we see today lead to the
following:

e Generative models that produce audio or video of anyone saying anything. There is already
substantial work on “style transfer” as well as photorealistic generative models in many domains.
Speech synthesis is becoming similarly competent. It is inevitable that we will be able to make
synthetic video and audio that is completely indistinguishable from the real thing.

e Generative models that produce coherent text content that appears as if has been written by a
human. Such generative content will be able to appear if the content was written by a particular
person. For example, in 2030 it will likely to possible for anyone to write a 4 paragraph email that
reads like it was written by your close friend.

e Adaptive botnets, worms, or viruses that use modern machine learning techniques to learn and
adapt. Viruses and botnets already cause a huge amount of damage by just copying code across
many computers. If they had the ability to design and experiment with new attack strategies, and
communicate what they learn to other copies, defending against them could become even more
difficult. Similarly ML could be used to make DDoS attacks more effective.

e Automated analysis of software vulnerabilities. People are already using ML to try to detect
vulnerabilities (for the purpose of defending against them) -- it is only a matter of time before they
start being used for attack (if they aren’t being so used already).

The above capabilities, together with similar powers of synthesis that we are likely to develop in the
next 15 years, could potentially combine to make the internet much more vulnerable to attack at much
lower cost, and by a wider set of people, than ever before. The first two capabilities would seem to
make it much easier to launch automated social engineering attacks with much higher success rates
than e.g. current spam email and phishing attacks, while the second two capabilities might make
technical attacks much more effective.

Combined, all of these capabilities could conspire to create an internet ecosystem where it is very

difficult to trust the communication that you receive and very easy to intercept, spoof, steal, or alter
communication, as well as to improperly gain control of internet resources. This is obviously already

After some legal argument, Judge Alberti declared that he was ready to see Deep Throat to
decide whether it was obscene. I argued that the judge need not view the film: no matter what its
content, I said, it would be unconstitutional for him to enjoin the showing of any film. If the D.A.
thought the film was obscene, he could wait until it was exhibited and then arrest those
responsible for its being shown. Judge Alberti insisted, however, on having Deep Throat
screened for him. As the equipment was being wheeled in the courtroom, I informed the judge
that I had no intention of watching the film.

would tell the jurors that I had never seen Deep Throat because I had chosen not to, and that they
had never seen Deep Throat because they had chosen not to. I would argue that the right to
choose not to see a film is just as important as the right to choose to see a film. Indeed, most
countries that prevent their citizens from seeing certain films also require their citizens to see
other films. I would remind the jurors that it was the District Attorney who was making them see
a film they had chosen not to see, in order to have them decide whether other people, who have
also chosen not to see would be offended if they were to see it. I hoped, by this argument, to
point out the absurd nature of the jurors’ task in an obscenity prosecution, and to get them to
focus on the important issue —namely, whether the outside of the movie theater, the only thing
that the unwilling public may have to endure, is offensive to those who cannot avoid it.

Judge Alberti excused me from watching Deep Throat, and Stork, Hagen and I left the courtroom
while the judge, half a dozen assistant D.A.’s, and a few court house personnel watched Linda
Lovelace and Harry Reems on a small video machine.

After about forty minutes Judge Alberti abruptly stopped the videotape and summoned us back
into court. “I’ve seen enough,” he declared with a disgusted look on his face. Then, turning to
me, he said, “You’re the lucky one. I had to sit through that trash.” The judge then declined to
issue an injunction against the scheduled showing of Deep Throat, because although he regarded
it as degrading both to men and women, he found that it was not obscene under the relevant
Massachusetts standards. The film would be shown that night.

When IJ arrived at Quincy House shortly before eight o’clock, a circus atmosphere prevailed.
Hundreds of pickets marched outside urging potential viewers to stay away. There was some
pushing and shoving. Slogans were shouted: “Freedom of the Press is not Freedom to Molest.”
“Pornography is an incitement to violence.”

I walked past the pickets and spoke to the assembled viewers and protesters:
Whether you folks like it or not, you are part of a rather important political event...I am
not here to either encourage or discourage the students who decided to see this

film...Were I not involved in this lawsuit, I would be out there defending the rights of
those picketers to...persuade you not to see this film.

Remote monitoring technology aims to keep seniors in their houses and out of nursing homes

Over the coming months a raft of new-and-improved remote monitoring devices will hit the
market, from GPS shoes that can track the whereabouts of wandering seniors to MedCottages,
portable RV-like units equipped with motion and monitoring systems that allow seniors to
maintain some independence from the backyard of their adult childrens’ homes.

“As we age, this is going to be a growing trend,” says Laurie Orlov, a Florida-based expert on so-
called “aging-in-place technology” aimed at keeping seniors in their houses and out of nursing
homes as long as possible.

“We have to get past the fear and antagonism among the older people who need it the most. I don’t
think they’re that technology-ready, but the boomers, who are their adult children, certainly are.”
Motion sensors strategically placed in the three-bedroom home where Howe has lived for 53 years
feed information right to her daughter’s laptop, detailing when she got out of bed (the Friday we
chatted it was 9 a.m.), walked into the bathroom (9:15 a.m.) or hovered at the kitchen table where
she keeps her pills (9:30 a.m.)

Even her blood-pressure reading (165/76) is fed to her daughter’s computer, along with her daily
weigh-in tally, providing a detailed graph which she often takes to her doctor appointments.

The only thing GrandCare can’t tell Pierce, because her system doesn’t include cameras, is if her
mother actually swallowed her pills.

Monitoring and in-home help technologies will be a $20 billion U.S. business in North America by
2020, predicts Orlov, founder of Aging In Place Technology Watch.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028123.txt,"on security and foreign affairs. Barely three weeks after I joined the
government, we had to decide on the most important agreement with the
Palestinians since Oslo. Dubbed Oslo II, it involved a major transfer of
authority and territory. The process would begin with our pulling out from more
than a quarter of the West Bank, including the major Palestinian towns and
some 450 smaller towns and villages. After that, there would be three further
redeployment phases, at six-month intervals, in so-called “Area C” of the West
Bank — a mix of unpopulated land, settlements and a number of points we’d
designated as strategically important. Under Oslo, and its parent agreement
Camp David, it was all part of ensuring the Palestinians could exercise their
“legitimate rights” in the “single territorial entity” of the West Bank and Gaza —
in other words, a path to statehood. But only by the time the final three phases
of redeployment were complete were we required to begin the “permanent-
status” talks on issues like land and borders, Israeli settlements, the future of
Jerusalem: the real core of a peace agreement.

By the time I joined the discussions on Oslo I in August 1995, the main
points had already been agreed. Rabin was in favor, as were virtually all the
cabinet ministers. Whatever scant influence I might exercise would have to
come at the decisive cabinet meeting, set for August 13. From the objections I’d
raised to the Gaza-Jericho deal as chief of staff, Rabin knew I’d be concerned
not only to ensure the security provisions avoided potential misunderstandings
on the ground, but about the longer-term implications, especially since the scale
of the Israeli withdrawals was much larger this time. In fact, the agreement
could be interpreted as requiring us to cede Palestinian control over virtually all
of Gaza and West Bank by the end of the third redeployment phase —quite
possibly before talks on the permanent-status questions had even begun.

I went to see Rabin a few days before the cabinet vote. I explained why I
thought the agreement was flawed. I argued we should either delay some of our
redeployments or bring the permanent-status negotiations forward. He listened
to me. He barely spoke. He knew I'd be against Oslo II, and knew the reasons
why. But we both knew something else: having been brought into government
by Rabin, I would be expected, on a vote of this importance, to be in his corner.

The cabinet vote wasn’t happening in a political vacuum. Likud’s defeat in
1992 had meant the end of Yitzhak Shamir’s leadership. The new Likud leader
was the former Sayeret Matkal officer with whom I’d shared a newspaper cover
in 1986 predicting that he and I would end up facing each other at the ballot
box: Bibi Netanyahu. Positioning himself as the fresh young face of Israeli

Trump's stupidity, said Bannon, could sometimes be made into a vir-
tue. Here was Bannon's idea: the president should make a retroactive claim
of executive privilege. I didn’t know. Nobody told me. I was ill-advised.

It was hard not to see Bannon’s satisfaction in a prostrate Trump
admitting to his own lack of guile and artfulness.

Bannon understood that this claim of retroactive executive privilege
would have no chance of success—nor should it. But the sheer audacity
of it could buy them four or five months of legal delay. Delay was their
friend, possibly their only friend. They could work this claim of retroac-
tive executive privilege, no matter how loopy, all the way to the Supreme
Court.

For this plan to work, the president would have to get rid of his inept
lawyers. Oh, and he would also have to fire Rod Rosenstein, the deputy
attorney general who was overseeing the Mueller investigation. Bannon
had been against the firing of Comey, and in the months after the appoint-
ment of the special counsel, he had fought the president's almost daily
impulse to fire Mueller and Rosenstein, seeing this as the surest invitation
to impeachment. (“Just don’t pay attention to his crazy shit” he had urged
everyone around the president.) But now they had run out of options.

“Firing Rosenstein is our only way out of here” Bannon told Costa.
“I don't come to this lightly. As soon as they went to Cohen—that’s what
they do in Mob prosecutions to get a response from the true target. So
you can sit there and get bled out—get indicted, go to grand juries—or
you can fight it politically. Get it out of the law-and-order system where
we are losing and are going to lose. A new DAG will review where we
stand on this thing, which could take a couple of months. Delay, delay,
delay—and shift it politically. Can we win? I have no fucking idea. But I
know on that other path I’m going to lose. It’s not perfect . . . but we live
in a world of imperfect”

Costa’s story, which was posted online later that day, described Bannon as
“pitching a plan to West Wing aides and congressional allies to cripple the
federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, according
to four people familiar with the discussions.” But however many people

SIEGE 37

Costa had spoken to about the background machinations of Steve Ban-
non, what mattered was that he had spoken directly and at length to
Bannon himself, who was using the Washington Post to pitch a plan to
the president.

Bannonss three-part plan for Trump instantly made its way to the
Oval Office. And the next morning, the president offered Kushner his
view that he should fire Rosenstein, reinstate a claim of executive privi-
lege, and get a tough-guy lawyer.

Kushner, pressing his own strategies, urged his father-in-law to move
cautiously when it came to Rosenstein.

“Jared is spooked,” said a scornful Trump later that day while on the
phone to a confidant. “What a girl!”

Not only has the verdict of history condemned the words of the Sedition Act, it has also
condemned the selective manner in which it was enforced against certain journalists and
newspapers but not others. If there are to be any restrictions of freedom in the press, they should
be applied uniformly. Ifthe publication of classified material is to be prosecuted, then all who
publish it should be prosecuted, not only the marginal, the powerless, the “irresponsible” and the
unpatriotic --- in the eyes of the government . If all are prosecuted, there is the possibility of the
self-correcting mechanism of democracy operating to change the law, by narrowing it to
criminalize only those categories of currently classified information that truly endanger national
security. If untrammeled prosecutorial discretion is permitted, then the law can be kept as broad
and overinclusive as it currently is, without fear that the New York Times will be caught in its
web. But if only the weak and the unpopular are selected for prosecution, the pressures for
change will diminish.

Moreover, selective prosecution of only certain journalists who violate broad statutes will
encourage some in the media to curry favor with the government, and the government to curry
favor with certain media. This is an unhealthy and dangerous relationship in a democracy in
which the press is supposed to check the government and be independent of its control.

The exercise of some discretion is necessary under the statutory scheme that currently
criminalizes the publication of classified material. If all journalists who publish any classified
material were to be prosecuted, there would be few left. The New York Times and its publishers,
editors, and national security reporters would be convicted felons, since the current statutes are
written in the broadest of terms that invite the exercise of discretion, which has always been
employed to immunize the mainstream media.

In a definitive history of this problem, the author, Gabriel Schoenfeld, argues that an appropriate
balance must be struck and that neither the press nor Congress can be relied on to strike that
balance. Surprisingly, and wrongly in my view, he places his greatest reliance on the exercise of
prosecutorial discretion and in the common sense of juries. History has not vindicated this trust,
especially in times of national turmoil and fear. For me, a better democratic answer is for the
courts to demand that legislatures enact clear, precise and extremely limited prohibitions on the
real-time disclosure of only the most necessary of secrets. These statutes must neither be
overinclusive or underinclusive (as are current laws). They should be capable of uniform and
universal application that constrain the power of the government to pick and choose. Precise
codification is not a perfect solution to an intractable dilemma, but it would be a significant
improvement over the unacceptable current situation.

In vibrant democracies there will always be tensions between the government’s need to keep
secrets and the news media’s need to reveal them. There will never be a perfect solution or an

agreed-upon balance. This is as it should be. Constant tension between the government and the
press is an essential requisite of our system of checks and balances.

of things I thought were a priority to get done - still remains in the whole unresolved.

The IT, is virtually untouched and is still in desperate need of a format - reporting flawed cumbersome and
inaccurate . all done by hand as one -off exercises , when either you or brad ask for it - airplane: re structure,

be constructive

a paramount requirement 16 months after i emailed you re their importance. THe Phaidon transaction papered

that you re-do bank loans. no need to pay interest at higher rates on boat or plane. . as Richard is now no
longer trustee. re- do will, make suydam executor , with Barry, and john as back up. pay 1 million a year for
executor role. get rid of Judy Black trust, deal with gifts and their tax returns, . review amounts to kids at fixed
ages. put more protections in for Alex and Victoria. , distribute some money to kids let them make

decisions. , decide art division with children in attendance . have fire drill done on estate. fill out

estate returns as if you and Debra died today, choose advisers - rick bronstein said the only 1040 he ever filled

Civ. P. 1.280(c).

Defendant issued a vastly overbroad subpoena to this non-party which included 25
separate document requests, many with subparts. In addition to placing an undue burden on this
non-party to have to search for the broad scope of materials requested, the document requests seek
information that is irrelevant to the Florida Defamation Action and clearly intended to “embarrass
and oppress” this non-party. Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.280(c). Defendant’s overly broad subpoena to non-
party, Jane Doe No. 3, goes so far as to seek documents relating to former President, Bill Clinton
and former Vice President, Al Gore, which, even if such documents existed, would be absolutely
irrelevant to the Florida Defamation Action. See Toledo v. Publix Super Markets, Inc., 30 So. 3d
712 (Fla. 4 DCA 2010).

Defendant’s requests can be grouped into four key categories: (1) documents that contain
highly personal and sensitive information sought only to harass, embarrass and intimidate the non-
party; (2) documents unrelated to this action and, instead, intended to gain discovery relating to
Defendant’s admitted “goal” of putting this non-party in “jail,” bringing a new case against Jane
Doe No. 3, or related to the federal action; (3) documents that contain personal financial or other
confidential information; and (4) privileged communications between the non-party and her
lawyers. Non-party, Jane Doe No. 3, has filed specific objections as to each request sought in
Defendant’s subpoena as set forth in Exhibit 9. Here, Jane Doe No. 3 provides the Court with a
sampling of the oppressive nature of the subpoena that is the subject of her detailed objections.

a. Category 1 — Overly Broad Subpoena Requests Intended Solely to Harass, Embarrass
and Intimidate the Non-Party by Seeking Highly Personal and Sensitive Information

It is clear from the Defendant’s requests that his intent is to intimidate and harass this non-
party by seeking highly sensitive personal information that is irrelevant to this action. For

example, Request no. 16 seeks “Any diary, journal or calendar concerning your activities between

yet began to study but one day J would love to practice massage therapy.

She introduced herself as Ghislane Maxwell. I would later find out that
she was the daughter of the late prominent businessman and disgraced
newspaper tycoon, Robert Maxwell. I told her my name is Jenna pointing
to my nametag on my shirt and offered her a cold or hot beverage, as
those were my instructed duties at work. She accepted a tea and went on
to chat a bit about this rich guy that she worked for and she knew off-
hand that he was looking for a massage therapist. Just doing me a good
deed out of her kindness of her heart, 1’m sure, she offered to introduce
me to him. I declined her first proposition, thinking out loud, told her I
didn’t know the body well enough to even attempt an interview. She
didn’t seem worried at all by my fear of incompetence saying that if he
liked me enough he would get me the best training in the industry.
Ghislane thought I had a cheery persona and fit the quota for what he was
looking for and as she put it an enthusiastic learner that she said she
gathered from the sticky notes popping out of the various sections in my
book. | accepted her phone number and the house address and told her I
will call her if | am able to come over after work. I rushed over to the
tennis courts where my dad was working and told him of the news. We
both thought this could be a wonderful opportunity to get my
accreditation in massage therapy. Seeing that it was a lady in her late
thirties who came off as more of a nurturer rather than a procurer, neither
of us saw any reason to be hesitant.

Chapter 4

At around Five p.m. my dad drove me down to the bottom of “El Brillo
Way.” on the Palm Beach intercostal. We pulled into a short driveway
beckoning a large pink mansion with heavy wooden doors. I was so
excited about this chance and asked my dad to wish me luck. He gave me
a big squeeze and wished me the best. He walked me to the front door
and I rung the door chime. Moments later we were greeted by an older
gentleman dressed in a casual butler uniform. I told him 1 was here to
meet Ms. Maxwell for a massage trial and he opened the doors for my
father and I telling us to wait in the entry as Ms. Maxwell would be on
her way any second, and she was. Down the stairs she walked with a
warm smile, her short black hair seeming very proper and elegant, for
now. She shook my fathers hand and thanked him for bringing me and
kissed us both on the cheeks. They spoke briefly about whom she worked
for and about Mar-a-Lago where we worked. She was in hurry, you could
tell to end the conversation and say good-bye to my dad, which she did so

ever pleasantly. She said the boss was upstairs and waiting my arrival, so
with that I said bye to my dad and began to follow Ghislane up the stairs.
I was so nervous, but I didn’t show it. I kept my reserve and demeanor
cool as ice, trying show maturity for the open position. We continued on
to the massage room, passing by a grand crystal chandelier, and a couple
lengthy wooden hall tables displaying a multitude of photos displaying
young girls and beautiful women, trying not to gawk at them I didn’t
even notice that some of those girls were only wearing their smile.

Ghislane asked me how my day at work was and I told her it was easy
peasy as always just trying to make simple conversation. There was a
fork at the end of the staircase and she led me to the right hand side. The
lights were dimmed in the bedroom but I could still see the King Size bed
in the middle of room, we did a U-turn around the bed, which led us into
a massage room. Dripping in luxury I could’ve definitely compared it to
the renowned Mar-a-Lago’s spa’s, it had marble walls and a glass
enclosed shower and self-automated steam room at the very end of the
Burberry carpeted room. There was a large mirror over a basin to the
right of the room with an array of oils, ointments, soaps, and lotions anda
small closed door, which I assumed must be a closet. The only thing that
struck awkward about this room was the naked man laying face down
atop of the turquoise massage table in the center of it. “I had to be
prepared for this,” I told myself. Massage was something | had never
done before so I quickly brushed away my thoughts of possible schemes,
wanting to believe whole-hearted this was going to be legit. Ghislane
introduced us to each other and | proceeded to make his acquaintance.

Looking up at from his downwards position, he looked me over and
gave a smile to Ghislane, an obvious notion of his approval. He was
Jeffrey Epstein as she pronounced for him, as if | supposed to recognize
his name or something. He affirmed, “It was his pleasure” and replied to
just call him Jeffrey, “No need for formalities” he answered, cleverly
putting me at ease. This man did not look like someone to beware of.
Both him and Ghislane appeared to be very nice people and conscious of
their health as their need for massages and spa visits, no alarm bells went
off, yet. I was prepped by Ghislane to “treat this as a lesson from her and
follow her exact lead, if] did good tonight then maybe I would become
Jeffrey’s Travelling Masseuse, seeing the world and getting paid well for
it’. I was very hopeful, a job like this could really make my dreams come
true.

I followed suit and washed my hands with warm water so the coldness
would not shock Jeffery’s naked body, then lathered them in rich bady
butter. Ghislane told me to always keep one hand on Jeffrey, even when
getting more lotion, so it didn’t make him lose concentration on being
relaxed. She gave me a tip and told me to keep a blob of lotion high up on

I’d met President Clinton briefly once before, when he received Syrian chief-of-
staff Hikmat Shehabi and me after our Blair House talks in 1994. But the Sharm
conference provided my first opportunity to spend time with him face-to-face.
When Peres and our delegation were about to leave, a Clinton aide approached and
said the President had asked whether I'd like to join him on the flight back to
Israel. Though as surprised as I was by the invitation, Shimon nodded at me to
signal it was okay, so I headed off for Air Force One. I spent most of the brief
flight talking to the President in the office space carved into the middle of the
plane. I would later discover that he quite often tried to engage with foreign
leaders’ colleagues or advisers on overseas trips, and not limit himself to summit
negotiations. It was part of his voracious appetite for information or insights which
he believed were essential to get a rounded understanding of the complexities of
the issues he was trying to address. Still, it was an extraordinarily fascinating 20
minutes. I got my first real look at Clinton’s natural gift for person-to-person
politics, as well as his mastery of both the detail and nuance of Israel’s
predicament, and of the wider conflict in the Middle East. Looking straight at me,
almost never breaking eye contact, he encouraged me to feel I had something of
value and importance to share with him. In fact, he created the impression that I
was the first sentient, intelligent human being he’d ever met. He made no grand
policy statements. Mostly, he asked me questions: what were the prospects of
Arafat reining in Hamas and Islamic Jihad? How were our relations going with
King Hussein? What was my view of the chances of concluding a peace with
Hafez al-Assad, despite his boycott of Sharm al-Sheikh? If Shimon did go on to
win the election, what new diplomatic opportunities could he as president, and we,
exploit in the search for peace? And, finally, what if Bibi won? I dare say this first
meeting was more memorable for me than for the president. But it would turn out
to provide a foundation for our joint efforts, in a few years’ time, to resolve the
very issues we’d talked about on Air Force One.

Though the summit restored a small opinion poll lead for Peres, that merely
reinforced Haim Ramon’s soccer-game strategy. I was more convinced than ever it
was wrong. Haim still wanted to ignore Bibi, but I pointed out that for at least one

Moscow that were more embarrassing to America. In June 2015, the
WikiLeaks website released another putative Snowden document,
two years after he had supposedly wiped his computer clean in Hong
Kong. It revealed that the NSA had targeted the telephones of three
consecutive presidents of France—Jacques Chirac, Nicolas Sarkozy,
and Francois Hollande.

According to a former NSA official, this document, like the 2013
Merkel material, was not among the data on the thumb drive given
to journalists in Hong Kong, which Greenwald confirmed. Green-
wald suggested to The New York Times that it might have been sto-
len by another penetration in the NSA, presumably one who had
access to the same secret compartments as Snowden in 2013. Since
Greenwald and Poitras had no way of knowing about the documents
that Snowden did not give them, it is equally possible that the Rus-
sian intelligence services obtained this document from Snowden and
later gave it to WikiLeaks. The release on Assange’s WikiLeaks site
came in the midst of NATO war games held near the Russian border,
which Putin had vehemently denounced. The accompanying article

© was co-authored by Assange, who now claimed to have access to ®
Snowden’s NSA material. Because Assange had been in telephonic
contact with Snowden in Hong Kong, and his deputy, Sarah Har-
rison, had spent five months in Moscow with Snowden in 2013, it
is certainly possible Snowden was his source. But it seems difficult
to believe that Assange waited two years before publishing because
he has made it part of his modus operandi to publish documents
immediately. Because WikiLeaks receives documents anonymously
via its Tor software, any party with access to the Snowden files
could have sent it. Subsequently, in July 2016, Assange released via
WikiLeaks a cache of politically disruptive documents from the files
of the Democratic National Committee. U.S. intelligence strongly
suspected they been stolen by the Russian intelligence services and
sent to WikiLeaks. If so, Russia made use of Assange and WikiLeaks
to exploit selected fruits of its espionage activities

Greenwald and Poitras also released belated documents. On
July 15, 2015, their web publication, The Intercept, released a
Snowden document that cited an NSA intercept of an Israeli mili-
tary communication concerning an Israeli raid in Syria on August 1,

Al Attacks on Computing Systems, Devices, Infrastructure (focus)
Manipulation & Disruption of Al Systems

(Contributions by Kathleen Fisher, John Launchbury, Ashish Kapoor, Sean, Shahar, Jeff Coleman and others)

Al will be used in new ways to enhance cyberwarfare. Targets could be either purely computational,
aimed at the bringing down of computing systems, the stealing of stored information, of gaining access
to monitoring activity and information streams. However, we are more likely to see potentially even
more costly attacks involving a combination of cyber and physical systems, e.g., uranium enrichment
plants, automated flight systems, weapon systems, automated driving systems, healthcare equipment,
oil refineries, or the large swaths of the power grid of the US or other countries.

Cyberwarfare is a domain in which the use of Al is inevitable. Attacks and/or responses are likely to
happen at computing rather than human speeds. As soon as one side has autonomous cyber warriors
systems (ACWs), other actors will have to adapt similar offensive or new defensive technologies. Given
this context, imagine building an ACW designed to seek, disrupt, and destroy within high-value
adversary networks and systems. The ACW has to be able to observe network behavior to build
situational awareness, find places to hide, create exploits to pivot to new places, build a map and use it
to navigate complex networks, find high-value information, and identify targets to disable or from
which to extract information.

Because high-value adversary networks are likely to be relatively isolated, the ACW will have very
limited opportunities for external command and control communication, so it will need to make many
decisions in isolation. It will read information it finds, build a model of adversarial intent, and then
invent ways to disrupt that intent.

Establishing the initial access to the high-value network is likely challenging, so the ACW will spawn and
spread to ensure that it can reconstruct itself if an active part is observed and destroyed. The ACW may
also create disguised caches of specific capabilities so that it can construct new mission-oriented
functionality from pieces. It will morph its active form so that defenses will have a hard time finding it.
It will inject itself into trusted binaries so that its behavior is difficult to distinguish from legitimate
applications.

The mission of the ACW will likely be defined in flexible terms because the human handlers will have
only limited information when it is deployed. The ACW will be designed to seek opportunities to
communicate with its human handlers, but it will also be designed to act autonomously if it observes
triggering behavior in the adversary’s systems. It may try to distinguish training states from active
warfare states on adversary systems. The creators of the ACW will have had to trade off the likely
effectiveness of the ACW versus the cost of premature action. Awareness of the adversary’s systems
will necessarily be limited in accuracy because it only gets a worm’s eye view of the network from the

AutHor’s Note

conducted by Connolly’s Vanity Fair colleague Vicky Ward, we
began to put the pieces to gether.

In a few instances, we have re-created brief scenes and
snatches of dialogue. These are based on interviews, police
investigation documents, and court filings. We changed the
names and identities of the girls, hoping to protect them from
more embarrassment and harm.

There never was any doubt that Jeffrey Epstein was guilty. He
admitted as much in the non-prosecution agreement he agreed
to sign in 2007. The question is, what exactly was he guilty of?

This book attempts to answer that question and many others
about this strange and mysterious man. These days people all
around the world are angry about and suspicious of the super
rich and powerful. The story of Jeffrey Epstein is an object lesson
about why we ought to be. To put it simply, some people think
they can operate outside the law. And that’s what they do.

therefore, generally poor. The area to its north, Asia Minor, is heavily
mountainous. Syria cannot project power to the north except with
great difficulty, but powers in Asia Minor can move south. Syria's
eastern flank is buffered by a desert that stretches to the Euphrates.
Therefore, when there is no threat from the north, Syria's interest —
after securing itself internally — 1s to gain access to the coast. Its
primary channel is directly westward, toward the rich cities of the
northern Levantine coast, with which it trades heavily. An alternative
interest is southwestward, toward the southern Levantine coast
controlled by Israel.

As can be seen, Syria can be interested in Israel only selectively.
When it is interested, it has a serious battle problem. To attack Israel,
it would have to strike between Mount Hermon and the Sea of
Galilee, an area about 25 miles wide. The Syrians potentially can
attack south of the sea, but only if they are prepared to fight through
this region and then attack on extended supply lines. If an attack is
mounted along the main route, Syrian forces must descend the Golan
Heights and then fight through the hilly Galilee before reaching the
coastal plain — sometimes with guerrillas holding out in the Galilean
hills. The Galilee is an area that is relatively easy to defend and
difficult to attack. Therefore, it is only once Syria takes the Galilee,
and can control its lines of supply against guerrilla attack, that its real
battle begins.

To reach the coast or move toward Jerusalem, Syria must fight
through a plain in front of a line of low hills. This is the decisive
battleground where massed Israeli forces, close to lines of supply, can
defend against dispersed Syrian forces on extended lines of supply. It
is no accident that Megiddo — or Armageddon, as the plain is
sometimes referred to — has apocalyptic meaning. This is the point at
which any move from Syria would be decided. But a Syrian offensive
would have a tough fight to reach Megiddo, and a tougher one as it

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016443.txt,"In May 2006, Recarey drew up probable cause affidavits, charging Epstein, two of
his assistants and one recruiter with sex-related crimes. Instead, Krischer took
what Recarey said was the unusual step of referring the case to a state grand jury.
Epstein was indicted in state court on a minor charge of solicitation of
prostitution.

Recarey said Krischer told him he didn’t believe Epstein’s accusers, and only two
of them were called before the state grand jury investigating the case — even
though police had lined up more than a dozen girls and witnesses at that time.

Believing that the case had been tainted, Reiter — that same month, May 2006 —
took a very public stance against Krischer, writing a letter, which was released to
the news media, calling on Krischer to remove himself from the case. The chief
then referred it to the FBI, which opened its own investigation in July 2006, FBI
records show.

Reiter said he was effectively blackballed in some Palm Beach circles as a result
of going over Krischer’s head, and their relationship, once strong, would never be
the same.

Reiter has no regrets about what he did.

“There are challenges here that don’t exist in a lot of other places because of the
affluence in the community, but the only way I could approach this case was that
none of that matters. The truth is still the truth. The facts are the facts.
Everybody is treated the same.”

In the years that followed, several of the victims obtained lawyers and filed civil
lawsuits against Epstein. About two dozen lawsuits were filed, starting in 2008.
The early cases were particularly brutal for his victims, the court records show.

The girls faced fierce grilling from another pack of Epstein’s civil attorneys, who
questioned them about their boyfriends, drinking, drug use, social media posts,
their parents and even their medical histories.

One girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and
knew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013172.txt,"256 13 Local, Global and Glocal Knowledge Representation

13.4 Knowledge Representation via Attractor Neural Networks

Now we turn to global, implicit knowledge representation — beginning with formal neural net
models, briefly discussing the brain, and then turning back to CogPrime. Firstly, this section
reviews some relevant material from the literature regarding the representation of knowledge
using attractor neural nets. It is a mix of well-established fact with more speculative material.

13.4.1 The Hopfield neural net model

Hopfield networks [Hop82] are attractor neural networks often used as associative memories. A
Hopfield network with N neurons can be trained to store a set of bipolar patterns P, where
each pattern p has N bipolar (+1) values. A Hopfield net typically has symmetric weights with
no selfconnections. The weight of the connection between neurons ¢ and j is denoted by wi;.
In order to apply a Hopfield network to a given input pattern p, its activation state is set to
the input pattern, and neurons are updated asynchronously, in random order, until the network
converges to the closest fixed point. An often-used activation function for a neuron is:

yi = sign(p; S- wisys)
JFi
Training a Hopfield network, therefore, involves finding a set of weights w,; that stores the
training patterns as attractors of its network dynamics, allowing future recall of these patterns
from possibly noisy inputs.
Originally, Hopfield used a Hebbian rule to determine weights:

P
Wig = Spi;
p=l1

Typically, Hopfield networks are fully connected. Experimental evidence, however, suggests
that the majority of the connections can be removed without significantly impacting the net-
work’s capacity or dynamics. Our experimental work uses sparse Hopfield networks.

13.4.1.1 Palimpsest Hopfield nets with a modified learning rule

In [SV99] a new learning rule is presented, which both increases the Hopfield network capacity
and turns it into a “palimpsest”, i-e., a network that can continuously learn new patterns, while
forgetting old ones in an orderly fashion.

Using this new training rule, weights are initially set to zero, and updated for each new
pattern p to be learned according to:

Federal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations

provision, it did not include two
additional provisions that the Board
declared were necessary to prevent
“unlawful encouragement of union
membership.” The Court disagreed,
stating

Perhaps the conditions which the Board
attaches to hiring-hall arrangements will in
time appeal to the Congress. Yet, where
Congress has adopted a selective system for
dealing with evils, the Board is confined to
that system. National Labor Relations Board
v. Drivers, etc. Local Union, 362 U.S. 274,
284-290, 80 S.Ct. 706, 712-715, 4 L.Ed.2d
710. Where, as here, Congress has aimed its
sanctions only at specific discriminatory
practices, the Board cannot go farther and
establish a broader, more pervasive
regulatory scheme.182

Congress in Section 8(a)(1) aimed its
sanctions only at employer actions that
interfere with the exercise of Section 7
rights. By this rulemaking, my
colleagues go farther and establish a
broader, more pervasive regulatory
scheme that targets employer inaction,
or silence, as unlawful interference. As
Local 357 instructs, they lack the
authority to do this.183

American Hospital Association v.
NLRB, 499 U.S. 606 (1991) (AHA), upon
which the majority heavily relies,
illustrates a valid exercise of authority
under Section 6. In AHA, the Supreme
Court unanimously upheld the Board’s
health care unit rule, finding that
Section 6’s general grant of rulemaking
authority “was unquestionably
sufficient to authorize the rule at issue
in this case unless limited by some
other provision in the Act.” Id. at 609-
10 (emphasis added). The Court further
found that the rule was clearly
consistent with authority under Section
9(b) to make appropriate bargaining unit
determinations. It specifically rejected
the argument that language in 9(b)
directing the Board to decide the
appropriate bargaining unit “in each
case”’ limited its authority to define
appropriate units by rulemaking.

Congress expressly authorized the
Board in Section 9(b) to determine
appropriate bargaining units and the
Board exercised its rulemaking
authority to promulgate a rule
“necessary to carry out’ Section 9(b). In
contrast, as previously stated, there is
no reasonable basis for finding that a
rule making it unlawful for employers to
fail to post and maintain a notice of
employee rights and selected illustrative

182 365 U.S. at 676.

183 My colleagues attempt to distinguish Local
357 as limited to an interpretation of Sec. 8(a)(3)
and 8(b)(2)’s prohibition of discriminatory
practices. That may have been the issue before the
Court, but I do not view the quoted rationale as so
limited.

unfair labor practices is necessary to
carry out any substantive section of the
NLRA. Nevertheless, the majority
construes AHA as an endorsement of
deference to the exercise of Section 6
rulemaking authority whenever
Congress did not expressly limit this
authority. This is patently incorrect. “To
suggest, as the [majority] effectively
does, that Chevron deference is required
any time a statute does not expressly
negate the existence of a claimed
administrative power * * *, is both
flatly unfaithful to the principles of
administrative law * * * and refuted by
precedent.” Railway Labor Executives’
Ass’nv. National Mediation Bd., 29
F.3d 655, 671 (D.C.Cir.1994) (citation
omitted). Were courts “‘to presume a
delegation of power absent an express
withholding of such power, agencies
would enjoy virtually limitless
hegemony, a result plainly out of
keeping with Chevron and quite likely
with the Constitution as well.” Id.

In sum, the majority’s notice rule does
not address a gap that Congress
delegated authority to the Board to fill,
whether by rulemaking or adjudication.
The Supreme Court has made clear that
“Tw]here Congress has in the statute
given the Board a question to answer,
the courts will give respect to that
answer; but they must be sure the
question has been asked.’’ NLRB v.
Insurance Agents’ Int’] Union, 361 U.S.
419, 432-433 (1960). The Supreme
Court also has made clear: ‘‘[Congress]
does not * * * hide elephants in
mouseholes.” Whitman v. American
Trucking Associations, 531 U.S. 457,
468 (2001).

My colleagues’ action here is
markedly like the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) regulation rejected as
ultra vires by the court of appeals in
Am. Bar Ass’n v. FTC, supra. The FTC
issued a ruling that attorneys engaged in
certain practices were financial
institutions subject to the privacy
provision of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley
Act (GBLA). Upon review of the
detailed statutory scheme at issue, the
court found it ‘difficult to believe that
Congress, by any remaining ambiguity,
intended to undertake the regulation [of
a subject] * * * and never mentioned
[it] in the statute.” 430 F.3d at 469. The
court further opined that to find the
FTC’s interpretation to be ‘‘deference-
worthy, we would have to conclude that
Congress not only had hidden a rather
large elephant in a rather obscure
mousehole, but had buried the
ambiguity in which the pachyderm
lurks beneath an incredibly deep mound
of specificity, none of which bears the
footprints of the beast or any indication
that Congress even suspected its

presence.” Id. No such conclusion was
possible in that case. No such
conclusion is possible here. Quite
simply, the Board lacks statutory
authority to promulgate a rule that
imposes a new obligation on employers
and creates a new unfair labor practice
to enforce it.

The Rule Is Arbitrary and Capricious

Even if the Board arguably has
rulemaking authority in this area,
deference is unwarranted under
Chevron and the Administrative
Procedure Act if the rule promulgated is
“arbitrary or capricious in substance, or
manifestly contrary to the statute.”
United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S.
218, 227 (2001). Also see AHA, 499 U.S.
at 618-20 (applying arbitrary and
capricious standard in its consideration
of the Board’s rule on acute care
hospital bargaining units). “Normally,
an agency rule would be arbitrary and
capricious if the agency has relied on
factors which Congress has not intended
it to consider, entirely failed to consider
an important aspect of the problem,
offered an explanation for its decision
that runs counter to the evidence before
the agency, or is so implausible that it
could not be ascribed to a difference in
view or the product of agency
expertise.” Motor Vehicle Mfg. Ass’n of
the U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto.
Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). “[Tlhe
agency must examine the relevant data
and articulate a satisfactory explanation
for its action including a ‘rational
connection between the facts found and
the choice made.’ ”’ Id. (quoting
Burlington Truck Lines v. United States,
371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)). See also
Business Roundtable et al. v. S.E.C.,—
F.3d—, 2011 WL 2936808 (D.C. Cir.,
July 22, 2011) (finding SEC acted
arbitrarily and capriciously by relying
on insufficient empirical data
supporting its rule and by completely
discounting contrary studies).

In AHA, the Board’s health care
bargaining units rule was supported by
“the extensive record developed during
the rulemaking proceedings, as well as
its experience in the adjudication of
health care cases during the 13-year
period between the enactment of the
health care amendments and its notice
of proposed rulemaking.’’ AHA, 499
U.S. at 618. The Supreme Court upheld
the validity of the rule finding it ‘“‘based
on substantial evidence and supported
by a ‘reasoned analysis.” Id. at 619
(citing Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass., 463
U.S. at 57).

“Shirt” (as featured in The New Yorker), and, this spring, the sixth module of the free seven-part
Poetry in America MOOC, which has registrants in over 150 countries.

Growing rapidly, and outpacing our current staff and infrastructure, Poetry in America has a
fundraising goal this year of 2.5 million dollars to fund its expanding group of projects. We’ve taken
a big step, hiring the design agency Threespot to help us develop our web presence. Our
website— to launch early 2016— will eventually serve as an online hub for our TV show and
educational projects. We hope you'll join us then for a virtual launch!

Finally, Jeffrey, you have been such a wonderful supporter of my Poetry in America project. The
Leon Black gift changed everything for me last year. It paid salaries for staff | desperately needed
to complete projects (detail below), but first and foremost, it gave me leverage, enabling me to set
down a Solid Harvard base for my activities by giving the school something to point to: this public
humanities project among the list of projects the Dean supports. The money did it: as soon as they
heard about the gift, they took my project more seriously. Because of that gift, the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences, which is space-stingy, found and rewired a studio space for me to house my video
production operation and team. That gift woke up the Deans to the importance of Harvard's role in
producing the highest quality humanities content for the WORLD, and not just for Harvard
students. My main employee has half of her salary paid with these funds, and the foundation of our
collection for PBS LearningMedia is being made with this support. This gift represented one of the
most consequential shifts of the last year, allowing me create content and launch projects this year
that make future projects that much more likely. If | can keep this base sturdy at Harvard, refilling
these coffers, | will be that much more able to keep working.

| am also so grateful for the help you gave me in defining my project for Templeton, and, what help
you have offered to give in bringing them around. | have, since Templeton turned me down, gotten
funding to produce video on two of the poems I'd proposed to Templeton and to create, and test,
that video in schools as | proposed. One of my partners in that project is Success Academy, where
| could also expand my work with Templeton. And there are still other poems that may satisfy their
character criteria more fully, including the third of the poems Id originally proposed and that Joe
Biden had agreed to discuss with me (on parenthood and humility). At this point, I’m gaining the
platform and the name recognition to be an effective spokesperson for the foundation on building
literacy and character in the schools.

It really means a lot to me, all financial help aside, Jeffrey, that you are rooting for me and thinking
about me. You push back a lot (as Larry does), and it’s always annoying but | always learn.

With abundant gratitude,
Lisa

their business dreams. Now there are the separate challenges and
possibilities of their actual wealth. If they had big dreams before, it’s
nothing to what they can have now.

In essence, as Epstein becomes more of a public figure the response to
this description of his livelihood, is, in the media and in high social circles,
“bullshit.” True, there is no clear alternate narrative. No one is accusing him
of anything, accept, sometimes, guilt by association. (In addition to Robert
Maxwell, who will be accused of fraud, there’s Steven Hoffenberg, briefly a
New York high flyer, who went to jail for a Ponzi scheme, for whom
Epstein acted as a consultant—along with, he points out, Paul Volcker.) But
the characterization persist: if it’s not clear, 1t must be murky. Sure,
Goldman Sachs partners and tech geniuses, they might have stratospheric
wealth, but what to make of a Coney Island, Zelig-like no-namer?

In 1994, just at the moment when Prince Charles is on television
acknowledging his love for Camilla Parker Bowles, Jeffrey Epstein is sitting
with his arm around Princess Diana at a dinner at the Serpentine Galley in
London (Diana is wearing her “revenge” dress that evening). Graydon
Carter, into his second years as editor of Vanity Fair, is also at the dinner.
Epstein’s rise and Carter’s rise are not, with a little critical interpretation,
that different. Both are a function of the age of new money, both are helped
by strategic relationships with the exceptionally wealthy (1.e. they are social
climbers), both men have made themselves up. To say that Epstein, in the
company of the Princess, sticks in Carter’s craw would be a big
understatement. Epstein becomes one of the “what do you know about him”
figures in Carter’s gossip trail—a story waiting to happen. A variety of the
gossip that begins to circulate about Epstein—for instance, that he secretly
films his guests—is seeded by Carter, who once advised me not to go to
Epstein’s house or accept a ride in his car least I risk being blackmail. (“For
what?” I asked Carter. “You can’t even begin to imagine,” said Carter.)

Epstein is playing a cat and mouse game with his own growing wealth
and influence. He is private and secretive, but grandly so. He joins the board
of Rockefeller University. He’s suddenly on the Trilateral commission, that
cabal of business people who fancy themselves, and who are fancied by
conspiracy buffs, as running the world. He buys from his client Limited
Founder Les Wexner the larges private house in Manhattan. (Rumors will
continue for many years, that Wexner owns the house and Epstein is just
squatting in it—an 18-year squat.) He buys an airplane. He buys another. He
expands his holdings in New Mexico. He begins a Zanadu refurbishment of
his Caribbean Island.

I read:

The crowd at the events top publicist Peggy Siegal has organized for Epstein proves the point, at least behind closed doors. I and
many others that know him describe him as brilliant, says Siegal.

His unique mind is what attracts the world's smartest people to his home. Last September, with Siegal's help, Epstein hosted a Break
Fast after Yom Kippur. A group of 120 friends brought their children over for a buffet dinner

This was just a few months after he finished his prison obligations in Florida.
And here he is, entertaining --- with children present.

This Break Fast is one of a number of social events involving post-prison Jeffrey that attracted celebrated, powerful people.
Of course I have zero idea who said, NO WAY and didn't cross his doorway.

My questions are:

1) I You have known him for decades, were/are friends, etc.

Why was your reaction to his crimes to continue being his friend --- and not in a covert way?
2) What would he have had to do for you to shun him --- to cut him out of your life?

You're the ultimate professional; you may not want to respond.

many with some kind of government linkage underscores the need for vigilance in
enforcing a stricter code of due diligence and transparency on the part of university
administrations and faculties.

Pressure on University Administrations

There are a large number of successful exchange programs between American and
Chinese universities. Three US universities have developed campuses in China (Johns
Hopkins, Duke, NYU), more than one hundred universities participate in cooperative-
education programs in China, and countless US faculty members participate in
collaborative projects with Chinese colleagues (principally in the sciences). These
relationships have not been easy to establish or maintain, but they have generally
been successful. A 2016 report by the Government Accounting Office, which reviewed
the cooperative programs of twelve American universities, found that the universities
“generally indicated that they experienced academic freedom,” while noting that

self- and internet censorship remains a problem.

In recent years, the outlook for these collaborations has deteriorated in line with
broader restrictions on academic freedom on Chinese campuses. In 2013, and
commensurate with CCP Central Committee Document No. 9, universities were
reportedly instructed to avoid discussing topics including “universal values” and civil
rights,?” and admonitions against teaching of Western values have continued. Since
2017, foreign university collaborative institutions have been required to institute
Communist Party committees and place a Party secretary on their management
boards.*8 In July 2018, the Ministry of Education ended 234, or one-fifth, of its
international university partnerships. More than twenty-five programs with
American universities were among them.”

The Chinese government has demonstrated a penchant for turning to these
collaborations as points of leverage when US universities have hosted the Dalai

Lama or held other events deemed politically sensitive or offensive to the Chinese
government. In such instances, existing collaborative exchange programs have been
suspended or put on hold, planned visits of university administrators have been
canceled, programs between university institutes and centers have been suspended,
and Chinese students wishing to study at these US institutions have been counseled
to go elsewhere. Such punitive actions resulting from campus visits by the Dalai Lama
have been taken against Emory University, the University of Maryland, the University
of California-San Diego, and others. In the case of the University of Maryland, which
hosted the Dalai Lama in 2013, there was temporary fallout, and then following the
2017 graduation incident the Chinese government again halted cooperation, seriously
damaging one of the most extensive exchange programs with China.

KEY COMPENSATION DESIGN AND DECISIONS TO LINK PAY AND PERFORMANCE

Underlying our executive compensation program is a strong belief in promoting a pay-for-performance culture. We accomplish this by linking

a significant portion of the compensation of our executive officers, including our named executive officers, to our performance. In addition, the
Compensation and Nomination Committee seeks to set challenging threshold and target performance levels that reflect our rapid growth trajectory and
business plans rather than goals based on prior years’ achievements. For each of the metrics used in our performance-based compensation plans, payouts are
eared based upon outstanding performance as measured against pre-established financial objectives.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE HIGHLIGHTS REGARDING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

We endeavor to maintain sound executive compensation policies and practices, including compensation-related corporate governance

standards, consistent with our executive compensation philosophy. The following summarizes our executive compensation and related governance policies
and practices:

AGT was responsible for installing a “unique civil surveillance network in Abu Dhabi that means ‘every person
is monitored from the moment they leave their doorstep to the moment they return to it,’” according to the noted

security publication MiddleEastEye.<http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uae-israel-surveillance-2 104952769>
The invasive system is dubbed “Falcon Eye”.

Kochavi also owns Israeli security and private intelligence firms 3iMind and Logic Industries. Like Vocativ,
3iMind claims to use “the deep web” to mine information, though in 3iMind’s case it provides spy services, not
journalistic ones. 31Mind even advertises online that it will spy on “the planning and execution of violent civil

unrest” for clients.<https://www.3i-mind.com/use_cases/political-social-unrest/>

The website for Kochavi’s mother company<https://www.agtinternational.com/about/>, AGT, claims its current
business is using “Internet of Things” technology for entertainment and “fashion” applications in partnership
with the giant talent agency WME-IMG ... though it’s unclear what any of these applications really
are<http://www.curoleague.net/final-four/berlin-2016/news/1/6vokoibj5fsgqg4q/heed-the-event-platform-based-
joint-venture-between-wme-img-and-agt-international-makes-first-official-foray-into-sports>, and certainly
what value they provide for entertainment. Security experts say Internet of Things type sensors could be tied
together to monitor crowds for security purposes.

According to Israeli and U.S. Jewish publications, the lines within Kochavi’s companies can blur, with Vocativ
employees doing work for 3iMind and Logic, and vice versa. So who was this “journalist” arrested amid the
unrest on Inauguration Day? Was he actually doing journalism? Or, as some journalists around town have been
asking, could he also have been doing surveillance of anti-Trump demonstrators on behalf of an Arab or Israeli
client, possibly a foreign government?

A call to Ruemmler was returned by someone identifying himself as a Vocativ spokesperson. He told Heat
Street that the arrested employee, Evan Engel, was doing purely journalistic work at the time he was detained.

“The arrest, detainment and rioting charge against journalist Evan Engel who was covering the protests for
Vocativ are an affront to the First Amendment and journalistic freedom,” the spokesperson said. “Vocativ will
vigorously contest this unfounded and outrageous charge.”

Kochavi has taken pains to put a different face, unrelated to spying and surveillance, on his American activities.
Vocativ acts like a news organization, though it’s made little splash (and gets remarkably little web
traffic<http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/vocativ.com>) for an operation so large and expensive.

Kochavi has also shown little hesitation to pay top dollar for access to the most powerful figures in America to
provide legitimacy for his American activities. Last fall’s Wikipedia data dump revealed that he and his
longtime business partner, New York rainmaking lawyer Mary Edelman, offered Bill Clinton millions of dollars
to serve as honorary chairman of the company that would become Vocativ. <http://heatst.com/biz/wikileaks-
bill-clinton-turned-down-8-million-to-be-honorary-chairman-of-news-site-vocativ/> Clinton turned them down,
perhaps nervous about Kochavi who’s been described as “a mysterious even somewhat shady character” and the
Israeli “version of the old-fashioned arms dealer with a suit and an MBA” by the progressive Jewish blog
Tikkun Olam.<https://www.richardsilverstein.com/2014/12/04/israeli-cyber-security-merchant-peddles-wares-

Sex Slavery lawsuit links Trump’s
Mar-a-Lago to pedophile ring: report

DON'T MISS STORIES. FOLLOW RAW STORY!

Last fall’s allegations of sexual assault against President Donald Trump failed to stop his
presidency, but one of the more explosive of those allegations is once again making headlines.
POLITICO reported that a new lawsuit reveals details linking Trump to billionaire
pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender. The reports indicate that one lawsuit
contains information about Virginia Giuffre who alleges that she met Epstein while working as
a towel girl at Mar-a-Lago when she was 15 before being recruited into “sexual slavery”.

No one lives at the end of the road, which
is every bit as wavy and disorienting as the
adjoining highway. It empties into a scene
that seems engineered for maximum
bewilderment: three high-rise cranes,
topped with fluttering Palestinian flags,
tower over massive stone and concrete
building frames. Cement-mixers, painted
the same shade of light green as the arrow
at the turnoff and marked with the project's
logo -- a wiry oval with a cute little convex
loop at the end, like a child's drawing of a
heart that could also be a tree -- line up to

you he rarely failed to remind me in our conversations that you told him that he works for you and not for

I have taken heat for years over the fact that 1 gave you no more than carlyns name, . no follow up
questions no interactions , not even one single question asked of me re her work. (that was Eileen _) but
somehow carlyns fuck up was my doing. . _ when i told you that i thought Eileen wasn't up to the task, you
bellowed. that i was talking out of both sides of my mouth. . You told me this year , that by trying to protect
you from crazy joslin, I had in essence fired him and it was my responsibility to do his work. it then turns out
that he didn't consider himself fired at all he just received less money. and continued to make a really
dangerous mess.. Joshn castrucci, in your eyes, was also my doing , though email after email said , I take no
responsibility for him,and 1YOU SHOULD NOT HIRE HIM |!!! , your response was that was my opinion
was only because i didn't trust him. then to add insult to injury last jan you told me he was gone. however he
too is still there, and a waste of money and space.

My time is complicated by Donald's potentially eviscerating any reason for anyone to use the foreign
funds repatriation plan that 1 had put together. . however as you are aware I have some decisions to make re
my time allocation in the next year or two. so at least for a few weeks I am unable to commit much time and
make any future plans to guide you in the redoing of your procrastination produced mess.

That being said, the tasks at hand are the following.

You have a bomb of colored string that your retarded children have formed , It has to be very carefully
unwound , even the substitution of Barry for your next trustee, needs a careful focus on procedure.s It would
be much preferable if Wechsler was not his replacement. do you have any person you trust ??!. Iam
concermed re brad taking barrys place re XXXX. In the beginning Barry will need to find and learn
ACCURATE .. org charts. books , balance sheets . trust valuations. are alla part. Barry will need 2 months
to just get his arm around what is there , this is before any needed modifications.,

a way overdue re- fresh of your estate plan. . clats , trust. partnerships. grats. Ilcs. bank accounts , filing
requirements. etc. the long awaited review of the brh tra and shareholders agreement to see how they fit into
new plan. . XXXXX planning. art partnership engagement .. , airplane re-do. , buying another. .? boat

new. . Sell Artspace and shut down regan arts. . rationalize. cash flow reporting. cash mgmt. stock
sales. sec irs. gaming. foreign reporting. the 8865 mess will take months to review now. . you
CANNOT file unreviewed audited documents. .CANNOT!!! _ this will be very detailed work. . a self
inflicted wound - all avoidable if professionals had been in place to limit . or contain it. . . you will need
3 new hires .as there is no one in your office that is truly an A player. I have great hope in Barry as you
know. He will need to be trained. note
; One year is my guesstimate After 4 years of telling you , that you could do better than Halperin, : im glad
that you now are willing to follow barrys advice . I take no offense , in fact I take comfort in the fact that after
only one conversation with Barry you are now convinced to make that change . will take a year or more.

I expect as a friend you will understand that

I will no longer , not even for one day , work on your affairs . without the compensation that is long
overdue. . your unilateral idea of after care , not imposed on any other professional , except me, not paul

not say im surprised as you have email after email , stating that , if you save a great deal of money, you
wont want to pay , so limit itto 40m per year. - water under the bridge

If I can find the time to work , on your project , which is not by any means certain as Ihave said, I hope

Jeffrey, 
The hots did the sweep. Here are the new results taken as of a minute ago. You have only one negative article 
left on front page of google, which is the Huffington Post article. The Huffington Post is extremely hard to 
move, because it is so powerful, has millions of links to it, and uploads massive new and original content it on 
a daily basis with posting from out side readers. We managed to push it down the page, as it used to be at the 
top. If we were able to post original content to both the science and the org site (absolutely not a single word 
to this day by Jessica, just talk), we would have been able to push it down even further, and off the page. WE 
did manage to get rid of the daily beast article, which is now far removed, inspite of their own efforts to keep 
it prominent. 
Toxic suggested search engine terms that popped up automatically when you typed in your name are also now 
removed. 
Wikipedia was an important victory, as it will always be at the top of the search engine results. ow the head 
lines do not mention convicted sex offender or pedophile. Instead, Philanthrophic work, Epstein Foundation, 
Promotion of Scientists. We have stopped the hacking on your wiki site, and that was a major effor. Your 
wiki entry now is pretty tame, and bad stuff has been muted, bowlerized, and pused to the bottom. Careful 
editing and wording has muted the effect immensely. We hacked the site to replace the mug shot and caption, 
and now has an entirely different photo and caption. This was a big success. 
We pushed the Edge all the way up to the front page, where it was previously buried on page 5 of google 
search. 
We have promoted the other jeffrey epsteins, and other pages are also filled with your material. 
And, while the sites are up, and in the direction we hoped, they are still new, and subject to volitility, 
especially if new original content is not added on a minimum of a weekly basis. I have been forbideen to add 
new content to the philanthrophic site as well as the science site, and therefore, as a result our rating slipped 
down (still on the first page, but would have liked them (and some of the articles to been able to push 
Huffington off page). We also helped with you images, and the first images that come of you on a google 
search are not of your mug shot, etc. 
Your daily beast foe is still at it, and trying to promote her sites against you in the same way that we try to 
depromote you. 
As far as this site is concerned, and the continuation of this, I do not know what you wish to do. Clearly, you 
have no interest in my continuing. And, I am not sure if you want to continue the project at all. If the latter, 
and you stop, eventually it will just go into the way of entropy, and it will return to the old form. The major 
work has been done, but it needs to be maintained. For it to get better results, it needs to have constant input 
and supervision, and that means generating proper content, not just editing and grammatical fixes. Writers 
need to know what to write. THe philanthrophy site is at the bottom of the page precisely because you have 
not allowed us to add any content to it, and as a result it suffers. 
You paid Mike $2500, which he applied for the purchasing of his replacement servers, but his fee of $7500 
balance is now due if you want to continue. Please let me know what you want to do. I need to inform him, 
and if you are not going to use him, he needs to take on his other clients and devote his time there. 
This needs to be contrasted with what we started with, which was a search on your name, which had nine/10 
very toxic prominent stories, and toxic Wiki article and headline.

types experience emotions strongly and are sensitive, intuitive, nurturing and can be
overly sensitive and dependent.

What intuitions and observations relevant to self, subjective and objective,
emanate from the stylistic properties of feelings as derived from a time series of
observations of their associated actions suggested by their statistical measures, Hr,
Hu, AC and srs? The yield is rich and unexpected. We find an enjoining of values of
these measures, characteristic and invariant for each person, with the brain and
behavioral actions of entheogenic agents and Zen meditation in contrast with
worldlier focused attitude adjusting experiences and drugs. The range of their
potential values helps rationalize a person’s inclinations along the continuum of
attachment and detachment. This quantifiable dimension augers positively and
negatively with respect to the requirements for mystical experience as poetically
described by the ambivalent warrior prince, Ardjuna, in conversations with Lord
Krishna in the Bhagavad-Gita, the most famous and influential component of the
Mahabharata of Hindu scripture, A similar theme relevant to the occupancy of a
propitious range of values for the measures, H7, Hy, AC and srs, is found in what is
often called the Second Nobe/ Truth as explained by the Buddha, Siddhartha
Gautama, in lectures recorded in a deer park near Benares. We begin with the
results of some drug experiments conducted by behavioral neurophysiologists and
end with suggestions about the intuitive relevance of the conceptual content of
these measures to the universals of mystical experience and perhaps to elements
of spiritual transformation.

As described previously, the brain and behavioral process of habituation is
characterized by a decrease in the strength of an observable response to the
repetition of an evocative stimulus. Imagine the decrease in our startle responding
when a once unexpected loud noise continues to occur. Sir Charles Sherrington,

Snowden’s supporters do not accept that he stole such a large num-
ber of documents. According to Greenwald, the NSA vastly exagger-
ated the magnitude of the theft in order to “demonize” Snowden.
Snowden also disputed the magnitude of the 1.7 million number. He
told James Bamford of Wired in early 2014 that he took far fewer
than the 1.7 million documents that the NSA reported were com-
promised. He offered, however, no more specific details on the mag-
nitude of his theft. Nor did he offer Bamford any way to verify his
assertion other than to say that he had purposely left behind “a trail
of digital bread crumbs” at the NSA base in Hawaii so that the NSA
could determine which documents he “touched” but did not down-
load. A government official familiar with the investigation said no
such “bread crumbs” were found by the NSA.

It is possible that the NSA Damage Assessment team under Led-
gett falsified its findings or otherwise inflated the number of doc-
uments that Snowden stole. NSA executives might have also lied
to Congress to exaggerate the loss. But why would these officials
engage in an orchestrated deception that made them look bad? Exag-

© gerating the magnitude of the theft would only magnify Ledgett and ©
the NSA’s failure in its mission to protect U.S. secrets.

Officials had no reason to demonize Snowden for legal reasons.
He already had been. Greenwald and Poitras had already revealed
that Snowden had given them a vast number of NSA classified docu-
ments ona thumb drive that revealed, as Greenwald put it, the “blue-
prints” of the NSA. This drive contained, it will be recalled, no fewer
than 58,000 highly classified documents. In the eyes of the law, that
constituted an unprecedented breach of the laws passed to protect
communications intelligence. In any case, in Russia Snowden was
not in any jeopardy, no matter how many documents he was said to
have stolen. Interestingly, the thirty-five-page Defense Intelligence
Agency’s damage assessment reports that 900,000 Pentagon docu-
ments compromised by Snowden were not made public. That was
only disclosed via a Vice magazine Freedom of Information request
in June 2015.

Many of the putative 1.3 million documents that the NSA says
were copied and moved were duplicate copies. Others were outdated
or otherwise useless routing data. So the quantity does not tell the

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016325.txt,"Forget clockwork analogies; our brains are closer to a system of canals and locks, with
signals traveling like water from one state to another.

As I sit here typing, I’m actually seeking equilibrium states in an n-dimensional
topology of gradients. Take just one: heat. My body temperature is higher than the air
temperature, so I radiate heat, which must be replenished in my core. Even the bacteria
in my digestive tract use sensors to measure sugar concentrations in the liquid around
them and whip their tail-like flagella to swim “upstream” where the sugar supply is
richest. The natural state of all systems is to flow to lower energy states, a process that is
broadly described by entropy (the tendency of things to go from ordered to disordered
states; all things will fall apart eventually, including the universe itself).

But how do you explain more complex behavior, such as our ability to make
decisions? The answer is just more gradient descent.

Our Brains

As miraculous and inscrutable as our human intelligence is, science is coming around to
the view that our brains operate the same way as any other complex system with layers
and feedback loops, all pursuing what we mathematically call “optimization functions”
but you could just as well call “flowing downhill” in some sense.

The essence of intelligence is learning, and we do that by correlating inputs with
positive or negatives scores (rewards or punishment). So, for a baby, “this sound” (your
mother’s voice) is associated with other learned connections to your mother, such as food
or comfort. Likewise, “this muscle motion brings my thumb closer to my mouth.” Over
time and trial and error, the brain’s neural network reinforces those connections.
Meanwhile “this muscle motion does not bring my thumb close to my mouth” is a
negative correlation, and the brain will weaken those connections.

However, this is too simplistic. The limits of gradient descent constitute the so-
called local-minima problem (or local-maxima problem, if you’re doing a gradient
ascent). If you are walking in a mountainous region and want to get home, always
walking downhill will most likely get you to the next valley but not necessarily over the
other mountains that lie around it and between you and home. For that, you need either a
mental model (i.e., a map) of the topology so you know where to ascend to get out of the
valley, or you need to switch between gradient descent and random walks so you can
bounce your way out of the region.

Which 1s, in fact, exactly what the mosquito does in following my scent: It
descends when it’s in my plume and random-walks when it has lost the trail or hit an
obstacle.

Al
So that’s nature. What about computers? Traditional software doesn’t work that way—it
follows deterministic trees of hard logic: “If this, do that.” But software that interacts
with the physical world tends to work more /ike the physical world. That means dealing
with noisy inputs (sensors or human behavior) and providing probabilistic, not
deterministic, results. And that, in turn, means more gradient descent.

AI software is the best example of this, especially the kinds of AI that use
artificial neural-network models (including convolutional, or “deep,” neural networks of
many layers). In these, a typical process consists of “training” them by showing them

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018547.txt,"Here's my short answer for those guys: If you know women who are submissive and/or
masochistic in bed, that means those particular women like being submissive and/or
masochistic in bed. It doesn't mean anything else.

You're still here? Ah, well. I figured that wouldn't satisfy. So here's a longer answer:

Firstly, if you're a straight dude, and you're drawing conclusions about all women based
on the women you get involved with, then stop. Just stop. Even if you have slept with
zillions of women, you don't actually know what all women want, because:

A) Your experience of women is limited to women who got involved with you. You
are screening for certain qualities, sometimes consciously, and sometimes unconsciously
or by accident. If you tend to enjoy the dominant role, for example, or if you use a
dominant style of flirtation, then you could be screening for submissive female partners,
whether you intend to or not.

B) Everyone has biases, including you. I love the old saying: When all you have is a
hammer, everything looks like a nail. If you have a bias towards seeing women as
sexually submissive (and you almost certainly do, because female sexual submission is a
hugely prevalent cultural trope), then you're more likely to see female submission in
places where it does not exist.

C) Women, like people of all genders, are demonstrably varied. You really don't think
non-submissive straight women exist? Why then, it must be so inconvenient when I point
you to the work of blatantly dominant women, huh? It's shocking, I know... next I'll be
telling you that queer and asexual women exist! (Not to mention women who switch
among roles -- from submissive to dominant, from sadistic to masochistic. I primarily go
for submissive masochism, but still, I myself play for both teams.)

The thing is, though... no matter how many holes I can poke in these dudes' anecdotal
data, I can't bring myself to worry like they do. Even if a brilliant, well-reviewed study
came out tomorrow and proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that 100% of women are
submissive masochists in bed, I wouldn't care. (I bet you my left ear this study will never
happen, but I'm just saying, even if it did, I wouldn't care.)

Let me say it really clearly: Even if most women are submissive masochists in bed
(and I'm not convinced most women are), there's nothing wrong with that. I don't
care.

Why don't I care? Because all this anxiety and argument about submission -- and in
particular, what it means for women to be submissive; whether all women are
submissive; whether women are inherently or biologically submissive; whether
BDSM is an orientation or not... this is all the wrong question.

I'll note that the research seems to indicate that more kinky women are submissive than
dominant. Of course, this doesn't necessarily indicate anything about the tastes of women
who don't identify as kinky. And it's probably biased by culture, in that everything from
fashion photos to romance novels emphasizes female submission and male dominance.
Within BDSM culture, female dominance and male submission are often disappeared,
much to the justified frustration of actual female dominants and male submissives. When

The reason to write this book could not be more obvious. With the inauguration of Donald
Trump on January 20, 2017, the United States entered the eye of the most extraordinary
political storm since at least Watergate. As the day approached, I set out to tell this story in
as contemporaneous a fashion as possible, and to try to see life in the Trump White House
through the eyes of the people closest to it.

This was originally conceived as an account of the Trump administration’s first
hundred days, that most traditional marker of a presidency. But events barreled on without
natural pause for more than two hundred days, the curtain coming down on the first act of
Trump’s presidency only with the appointment of retired general John Kelly as the chief of
staff in late July and the exit of chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon three weeks later.

The events I’ve described in these pages are based on conversations that took place
over a period of eighteen months with the president, with most members of his senior staff
—some of whom talked to me dozens of times—and with many people who they in turn
spoke to. The first interview occurred well before I could have imagined a Trump White
House, much less a book about it, in late May 2016 at Trump’s home in Beverly Hills—
the then candidate polishing off a pint of Haagen-Dazs vanilla as he happily and idly
opined about a range of topics while his aides, Hope Hicks, Corey Lewandowski, and
Jared Kushner, went in and out of the room. Conversations with members of the
campaign’s team continued through the Republican Convention in Cleveland, when it was
still hardly possible to conceive of Trump’s election. They moved on to Trump Tower with
a voluble Steve Bannon—before the election, when he still seemed like an entertaining
oddity, and later, after the election, when he seemed like a miracle worker.

Shortly after January 20, I took up something like a semipermanent seat on a couch in
the West Wing. Since then I have conducted more than two hundred interviews.

While the Trump administration has made hostility to the press a virtual policy, it has
also been more open to the media than any White House in recent memory. In the
beginning, I sought a level of formal access to this White House, something of a fly-on-
the-wall status. The president himself encouraged this idea. But, given the many fiefdoms
in the Trump White House that came into open conflict from the first days of the
administration, there seemed no one person able to make this happen. Equally, there was

Dear Sirs: 
We are preparing an article about the calendaring today of Mr Edwards' claim against Mr Epstein for jury trial 
and the witness list which names 
victims of Mr Epstein. 
and other young women who allege they were underage 
Mr Edwards claims that Mr Epstein maliciously attempted to intimidate him and his clients into retracting their 
claims. 
Ms further has stated to us that she intends to testify that she was flown to London by Mr Epstein and 
instructed to have sex at age 17 with Prince Andrew. She alleges that she was paid $15k for this encounter. 
She claims that on another occasion, Mr Epstein flew two young women to a dinner for the purpose of 
entertaining President Clinton. She claims she herself was sex trafficked to several other men, whose contact 
information is contained in an address book of Mr Epstein's filed in court records. 
May we have a comment please? Our deadline is 1pm tomorrow (SATURDAY) ET. 
Yours sincerely,

the behavior of a normally distributed observable, the larger the series of neuronal
spike observed, the more likely that a longer interspike interval than had been seen
before will occur. Counter-intuitively, long intervals tend to be followed by more long
intervals as more shorts follow short intervals. Manic attacks cluster in time as does
a number of other brain and body diseases. Maybe it is intuitively obvious that bad
stuff tends to cause more bad stuff and good stuff is self-propagating. Having
suffered recently does not mean fate owes you one. The brain’s syncopated

segmentations of time can be translated into a creatively arrhythmic dance.

What makes neurologizing conversations like these about subtle human
experience possible are the human subjective scenarios we have agreed to short
hand with names of brain parts and neurochemicals. The how is where conceptual
connection is filled with post 19'° Century Spanish microscopic neuroanatomist,
Santiago Ramon y Cajal-like, intuitions about the functional role of brain structures:
we think motor automaticity and pacing when hearing the brain place names such
as caudate, putamen and cerebellum; we think limbic lobe when musing about
sexuality, rage and depression; we short hand /eft versus right hemispheric places
for verbal and sequential versus intuitive and geometric shape cognition; we point to
the frontal lobe for the future work of executive control, anticipation and paranoia;
the hypothalamus for primitively expressed appetites and to the brain stem for our
vital functions such as breathing and blood pressure. With respect to the brain
juices, we say dopamine for aggressive activity, norepinephrine for attention and
sensory discrimination and serotonin for hunger, mood and sexual inclination. No
matter how avant guarde our experimental techniques such as monitoring local
functional blood supply by fMRI, regional brain glucose utilization maps, time-
dependent changes in_ skull surface voltage using a cap studded with
electroencephalographic, EEG, leads, monitoring these voltage field via their
transverse magnetic fields by the frozen helmets of magnetoencephalography,
MEG, we conclude our work by calling forth named but still enigmatic brain parts
and their juices as mysteriously powerful little men and women executing

remarkably complex and subtle tasks, sometimes even when called upon.

someone new. Learn to ask for help and guidance, both from others in your S&M
community and from your partners.”

Scootah agreed: The first mistake I see newbie doms make is trying too hard to be some
kind of bad ass. Admit your inexperience. Be seen learning. Be modest and have a good
time. Learn to communicate well, and to really be friends with your prospective
partners.

For me, the bottom line of these conversations is that questioning gender roles, and
understanding gender complications, is an ongoing process. People have a lot of urges
and preferences that are politically inconvenient and which we will never fully
understand. Whether we're shaped by biology or culture, those feelings will still exist for
now, and we have to deal with them. There are ways to do almost anything such that
people respect each other, though -- whatever the implications for gender or power.
Violence is complicated ground, but it can be used in balanced and consensual ways that
end up bonding people together. Fifty Shades of Grey and Fight Club are both examples,
and I haven't even touched competitive sports!

ABUSE:
[theory] The Alt Sex Anti-Abuse Dream Team

I wrote this post in 2010 for the high-profile feminist blog Feministe. If I were to write it
today, then I would write it differently. In particular, if I were writing it today, then I
would emphasize that there are actually two primary patterns for abusive S&M
perpetrators. There are the ones I emphasized in this post, the ones who prey on
inexperienced people outside the community... but then there's another category:
perpetrators who achieve high status within the community and then use it to get away
with non-consensual things. Other BDSMers have been writing about this more and
more, and the discussion is really heating up right now, in 2012. My fellow feminist
BDSM writer Thomas MacAulay Millar has a particularly long, complex blog series
about patterns of abuse in the BDSM community that gives a lot of great reference links
to other articles on the same topic. I've mentioned Thomas before; I don't always agree
with him, but he's principled and passionate and smart. He blogs at the Yes Means Yes
blog, and the series is being published post-by-post even as I write this. The first post in
the series is available at this link:

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016331.txt,"the future cannot be the same as the past. The universe could even be careening toward a
“heat death,” some far-off time when the total stock of energy had uniformly dispersed,
achieving a state of maximum entropy, after which no further change could occur.

If information gua entropy could not be conserved, then Wiener concluded it was
folly for military leaders to try to stockpile the “scientific know-how of the nation in
static libraries and laboratories.” Indeed, “no amount of scientific research, carefully
recorded in books and papers, and then put into our libraries with labels of secrecy, will
be adequate to protect us for any length of time in a world where the effective level of
information is perpetually advancing.” Any such efforts at secrecy, classification, or the
containment of information would fail, Wiener argued, just as surely as hucksters’
schemes for perpetual-motion machines faltered in the face of the second law of
thermodynamics.

Wiener criticized the American “orthodoxy” of free-market fundamentalism in
much the same way. For most Americans, “questions of information will be evaluated
according to a standard American criterion: a thing is valuable as a commodity for what it
will bring in the open market.” Indeed, “the fate of information in the typically American
world is to become something which can be bought or sold;” most people, he observed,
“cannot conceive of a piece of information without an owner.” Wiener considered this
view to be as wrong-headed as rampant military classification. Again he invoked
Shannon’s insight: Since “information and entropy are not conserved,” they are “equally
unsuited to being commodities.”

Information cannot be conserved—so far, so good. But did Wiener really have
Shannon’s “information” in mind? The crux of Shannon’s argument, as Weaver had
emphasized, was to distinguish a colloquial sense of “information,” as message with
meaning, from an abstracted, rarefied notion of strings of symbols arrayed with some
probability and selected from an enormous universe of gibberish. For Shannon,
“information” could be quantified because its fundamental unit, the bit, was a unit of
conveyance rather than understanding.

When Wiener characterized “information” throughout Human Use, on the other
hand, he tilted time and again to a classical, humanistic sense of the term. “A piece of
information,” he wrote—tellingly, not a “bit” of information—“in order to contribute to
the general information of the community, must say something substantially different
from the community’s previous common stock of information.” This was why
“schoolboys do not like Shakespeare,” he concluded: The Bard’s couplets may depart
starkly from random bitstreams, but they had nonetheless become all too familiar to the
sense-making public and “absorbed into the superficial clichés of the time.”

At least the information content of Shakespeare had once seemed fresh. During
the postwar boom years, Wiener fretted, the “enormous per capita bulk of
communication”—ranging across newspapers and movies to radio, television, and
books—had bred mediocrity, an informational reversion to the mean. “More and more
we must accept a standardized inoffensive and insignificant product which, like the white
bread of the bakeries, is made rather for its keeping and selling properties than for its
food value.” “Heaven save us,” he pleaded, “from the first novels which are written
because a young man desires the prestige of being a novelist rather than because he has

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019895.txt,"done early in her modeling career—a leak that everybody other than Melania assumed
could be traced back to Trump himself.

Inconsolable, she confronted her husband. Is this the future? She told him she wouldn’t
be able to take it.

Trump responded in his fashion—We’ll sue/—and set her up with lawyers who
successfully did just that. But he was unaccustomedly contrite, too. Just a little longer, he
told her. It would all be over in November. He offered his wife a solemn guarantee: there
was simply no way he would win. And even for a chronically—he would say helplessly—
unfaithful husband, this was one promise to his wife that he seemed sure to keep.

OOK Ok

The Trump campaign had, perhaps less than inadvertently, replicated the scheme from Mel
Brooks’s The Producers. In that classic, Brooks’s larcenous and dopey heroes, Max
Bialystock and Leo Bloom, set out to sell more than 100 percent of the ownership stakes
in the Broadway show they are producing. Since they will be found out only if the show is
a hit, everything about the show is premised on its being a flop. Accordingly, they create a
show so outlandish that it actually succeeds, thus dooming our heroes.

Winning presidential candidates—driven by hubris or narcissism or a preternatural
sense of destiny—have, more than likely, spent a substantial part of their careers, if not
their lives from adolescence, preparing for the role. They rise up the ladder of elected
offices. They perfect a public face. They manically network, since success in politics is
largely about who your allies are. They cram. (Even in the case of an uninterested George
W. Bush, he relied on his father’s cronies to cram for him.) And they clean up after
themselves—or, at least, take great care to cover up. They prepare themselves to win and
to govern.

The Trump calculation, quite a conscious one, was different. The candidate and his top
lieutenants believed they could get all the benefits of almost becoming president without
having to change their behavior or their fundamental worldview one whit: we don’t have
to be anything but who and what we are, because of course we won’t win.

Many candidates for president have made a virtue of being Washington outsiders; in
practice, this strategy merely favors governors over senators. Every serious candidate, no
matter how much he or she disses Washington, relies on Beltway insiders for counsel and
support. But with Trump, hardly a person in his innermost circle had ever worked in
politics at the national level—his closest advisers had not worked in politics at all.
Throughout his life, Trump had few close friends of any kind, but when he began his
campaign for president he had almost no friends in politics. The only two actual
politicians with whom Trump was close were Rudy Giuliani and Chris Christie, and both
men were in their own way peculiar and isolated. And to say that he knew nothing—
nothing at all—about the basic intellectual foundations of the job was a comic

elements of the group's activities, including
its political and military wings, as part of
one holistic entity.

According to Hezbollah's top officials, this
unity of purpose among the group's diverse
activities is essential to its success. If the
military wing were separated from the
political wing, this would have
repercussions, and it would reflect on the
political scene, Qassem told a Lebanese
paper in 2000. Hezbollah's secretary-
general is the head of the Shura Council
and also the head of the Jihad Council, and
this means that we have one leadership,
with one administration.

The Jihad Council is the functional council
underneath the Majlis al-Shura responsible
for all military matters. Qassem writes that
it comprises those in charge of resistance
activity, be that in terms of oversight,
recruitment, training, equipment, security,
or any other resistance-related endeavors.
To accomplish its mission, the council is
divided into several smaller units in charge
of protecting the leadership and carrying
out internal and external surveillance, as
well as overseas operations. The party's
security branch is further broken down into
three subgroups: central, preventive, and
overseas security. In 2000, a dedicated
counterintelligence branch was reportedly
founded as well.

Church of the Creation”. He had been denied admission to the Illinois Bar because of his neo-
Nazi views.

Hale was invited to appear on the Today Show to be interviewed by Katie Couric. I was asked to
explain why I would even consider representing such a horrible racist and anti-Semite. Couric
began by asking Hale to describe his views “in a nutshell.” He went on about how non-
Europeans—by which he means Blacks and Jews—were destroying the “white race” and how he
was going to change that if he were admitted to the bar.

Couric then asked me why I believed a man with Hale’s views should be allowed to become a
lawyer.

KC: Mr. Hale should be allowed to practice law...why?

AD: Well first of all I am not a supporter of Mr. Hale. You asked about his views in a
nutshell. That’s where his views belong, in a nutshell. They are despicable, revolting
views. But what I’m concerned about is the precedential effect of giving character
committees the right to determine who shall and who shall not have the right to practice
law on the basis of ideology and belief. Remember character committees were invented to
originally keep out Blacks, Jews, gays, women, leftists...I just don’t want to see a
resurrection of character committees probing into the ideology of people like Mr. Hale. If
I take his case, and he’s asked me to represent him, I told him this and he knows this. All
the fees will be contributed to anti-racist organizations which will fight the ideology of
bigots like him. I hope the American public listening to him would reject his ideas in the
marketplace but not through censorship of the kind that the character committee is trying
to practice.

KC: But simply espousing these views, couldn’t that lead to violence, by other
individuals?

AD: Well there is no question how our Constitution strikes that balance. Reading the
work of Marx can lead to incitement. Reading the Bible can lead to incitement. But we
don’t draw the line at the espousal of views. We draw it at incitement or violence itself
and we don’t want to have a different standard for racists than we do for other people.

Couric then turned back to Hale:

KC: Ok, you talk about your enemies, Mr. Hale, and among them are Jews. Do you see
the irony that you hate Jews and yet you are calling on Mr. Dershowitz to help you?

MH: Well the fact of the matter if having a “Dershowitz” in this equation has brought our
church an incredible amount of publicity and as a minister in my church, it is my obligation
to bring about as much publicity as possible.

to spend time with joslin Joe and john, - the situation in your office is wholly ludicrous - to summarize - the

brads specific authorization ) - brad has no idea even as to what questions to ask. he knows little of finance, is
run roughshod over by almost everyone in the office. he is a little man , using your power, to appear larger .
Eileen was self aware enough to know she was over her head , that is a huge difference. bad info is

they cannot be used at all. (ZERO benefit ) though you will be told yes they were deducted on the return they

these worries hit at once in January and February, prompting the S&P 500 to fall over 10% from its
2015 closing level of 2043. The year, at that point, appeared bleak.

Our view was to maintain a balanced and diversified position throughout the downturn, particularly
for the long haul, due to our belief that the major concerns, although understandable, were simply
not going to fully develop and asset prices would begin to track fundamentals more effectively
through the remainder of the year. The potential for risk assets to climb higher was there but a
catalyst was needed. For our full view on the year ahead, please read our December 2016 Monthl
Letter.

Exhibit 1: Mid-Cycle Slowdown Ended in Early 2016,
When Oil and Dollar Stabilized)

Source: EMVCME; FRB/Haver Analytics, Data as of December 5, 2016

!
Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Our core belief was centered on healthy consumers who would indeed pick up their spending from
savings at the pump and become more confident as job growth continued and real incomes
increased. We also believed U.S. financial conditions and the economic backdrop would improve in
the second half of the year as the pressure from the strong dollar subsided and the deflationary
effects of the collapse in oil prices began to fade. In other words, we were witnessing evidence that
the mid-cycle slowdown that had hurt economic growth and corporate earnings was ending. [See
Exhibit 1] Based on this core belief, the “grind it out” year for risk assets would be back on track,
the business cycle would extend into 2017, bond yields would slowly shift higher, and equity
markets had the potential to head toward previous highs.

A series of unexpected outcomes

At this point, we did not characterize 2016 as The Year of the Unlikely. However, if you consider
specific events throughout the year in finance and sports, it is easy to see that now. We already
mentioned the second plunge in oil prices to the mid-$20s per barrel to start the year, and bond
markets in some areas of the world actually had negative yields—meaning the lender paid the
entity issuing the bonds to take their money! This was unlikely. How about Brexit vote in Great
Britain? Unlikely. In sports, Villanova University winning the national championship in men’s
college basketball (Nova’s first championship since 1985), Leicester—the English football club—

nominal growth of the economy (see Exhibit 4). Second, the recent backup in interest rates was
driven primarily by improving real growth expectations, not higher inflation. This distinction is critical,
because higher rates in response to improving real growth tend to benefit earnings sufficiently to
overcome the downward pressure they place on valuation multiples. Finally, it will take a number of
years before higher rates meaningfully impact aggregate S&P 500 interest expense, considering 91%
of S&P 500 debt is fixed-rate and only 13% matures over the next two years.

Low Probability of Recession

We continue to maintain a low, 10%, probability of recession driven by:
e The positive trend of leading economic indicators
e Low levels of inflation

e The continued slow but steady pace of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. We believe that
Federal Reserve Chairman Powell’s recent commentary indicates that the FOMC will continue to be
driven by data and financial market conditions. Their stated goal is to extend this expansion
“indefinitely.” While the Federal Reserve dots point towards four more interest rate hikes by the end
of 2019, we do not think that such hikes materially increase the odds of a recession in an economy
that continues to grow at levels that are generally regarded as above trend growth in the US.

Promote Reciprocity

The academic community nationwide should work toward a common set of principles
and practices for protecting academic freedom and promote greater reciprocity.

To prevent influencers from using divide-and-conquer strategies (by rewarding
some institutions while punishing others), it is important for the national academic
community as a whole to come together to formulate and implement these principles.
US universities should not only work together but they should also work with other
universities around the world to develop a “Code of Conduct” for acceptable and
unacceptable practices in academic exchanges with Chinese institutions and funders.
(The section on think tanks in this section recommends similar measures.) The
academic community and government should also monitor instances where Chinese
entities may acquire financially challenged American colleges outright, ensuring that
their academic integrity is not compromised.**

Universities can and must continue to play a positive role in the US-China relationship.
Indeed, by introducing international students to American life and values, and
connecting them to new personal and professional relationships, universities are
arguably the important means by which the United States exercises its soft power.
Generally—but not always—individuals undergoing such an experience take a more
positive view of the country. Unfortunately, as Chinese students contribute much, not
least monetarily, to American universities, universities have been too slow to help them
integrate themselves more organically into campus life. As a result, Chinese students
report unacceptably high levels of depression and isolation or simply clubbing up with
each other.** While acting to mitigate the risks of improper interference, universities
must not forget their obligations to these students nor lose sight of the far greater
opportunity to advance cooperation and understanding.

general public will be moved to these critical economic reforms. (3) I repeat
a point I’ve made in the past, that because the mainstream media and most
scholars are still so skeptical of Mr Trump’s policies, the hurdle for him to
clear and impress positively is very low. Ironically, such general hostility
will probably work in favour of the Trump Administration. 5 days after the
surprise election victory, the press declared that Mr Trump’s transition plan
was in hopeless disarray, only for Mr Trump to announce one cabinet
appointment every day — ahead of the schedule of Presidents Obama and Bill
Clinton when they got elected. (4) We will likely see a less radical President
Trump. We have already seen this on various issues (the Wall, prosecuting
Ms Clinton), and my guess is that the trade policy will be more restrictive,
but the changes will be nuanced at the same time. The appointment of the
next Treasury Secretary will convey an important message. (5) I personally
think that various countries will likely adopt industrial policies, as a
substitute for slower trade globalization. Already, the UK’s PM May
announced an ambitious industrial strategy, with a focus on technology. The
government is committed to investing in R&D through the Industrial
Strategy Challenge Fund. Regular readers of our work should also know
that that is what I would recommend for Japan to consider. I just came back
from a trip to Singapore, and understand that the government there is also
struggling to find the best strategy to deal with the next phase of economic
development, now that the growth model based on trade and finance may be
coming to an end. I think the US should also contemplate its own industrial
policy. The title of this section is ‘economic Olympics’ to convey the notion
that the world is in competition, not just along the axes of cheapness of
labour and technology. There are different disciplines (analogous to the
various sports in Olympics) in which any country can excel, if the efforts are
appropriately focused. Instead of being mediocre in many events, countries
should seek to win the gold medal in their best events...

5%-plus nominal GDP growth in the US in 2017? There are several
inconsistencies in the market trends: (1) a strong dollar and strong US
equities; (2) protectionism and a strong dollar (Mexico, for example, has
gotten 10% cheaper so far this month, and China is also cheaper. The
greater the threats of protectionism against these countries, the cheaper are
their costs of production...); (3) higher yields and strong equities; (4) Mr
Trump does not like Chair Yellen or the Fed but he still needs and prefers
low interest rates. The only variable that can address these inconsistencies is
3-4% real economic growth and 5%-plus nominal GDP growth in the

US. While it is unlikely that 5% nominal GDP growth is sustained over
time, the atmospherics will stop the talk about ‘r-star’ and help support
interest rates in the US. 2017 may very well see 5%-plus nominal GDP

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016889.txt,"Those are also the processes by which all new knowledge is created: They are how we
innovate, make progress, and create abstract understanding for its own sake. This is
human-level intelligence: thinking. It is also, or should be, the property we seek in
artificial general intelligence (AGI). Here I'll reserve the term “thinking” for processes
that can create understanding (explanatory knowledge). Popper’s argument implies that
all thinking entities—human or not, biological or artificial—must create such knowledge
in fundamentally the same way. Hence understanding any of those entities requires
traditionally human concepts such as culture, creativity, disobedience, and morality—
which justifies using the uniform term people to refer to all of them.

Misconceptions about human thinking and human origins are causing
corresponding misconceptions about AGI and how it might be created. For example, it is
generally assumed that the evolutionary pressure that produced modern humans was
provided by the benefits of having an ever greater ability to innovate. But if that were so,
there would have been rapid progress as soon as thinkers existed, just as we hope will
happen when we create artificial ones. If thinking had been commonly used for anything
other than imitating, it would also have been used for innovation, even if only by
accident, and innovation would have created opportunities for further innovation, and so
on exponentially. But instead, there were hundreds of thousands of years of near stasis.
Progress happened only on timescales much longer than people’s lifetimes, so in a typical
generation no one benefited from any progress. Therefore, the benefits of the ability to
innovate can have exerted little or no evolutionary pressure during the biological
evolution of the human brain. That evolution was driven by the benefits of preserving
cultural knowledge.

Benefits to the genes, that is. Culture, in that era, was a very mixed blessing to
individual people. Their cultural knowledge was indeed good enough to enable them to
outclass all other large organisms (they rapidly became the top predator, etc.), even
though it was still extremely crude and full of dangerous errors. But culture consists of
transmissible information—memes—and meme evolution, like gene evolution, tends to
favor high-fidelity transmission. And high-fidelity meme transmission necessarily entails
the suppression of attempted progress. So it would be a mistake to imagine an idyllic
society of hunter-gatherers, learning at the feet of their elders to recite the tribal lore by
heart, being content despite their lives of suffering and grueling labor and despite
expecting to die young and in agony of some nightmarish disease or parasite. Because,
even if they could conceive of nothing better than such a life, those torments were the
least of their troubles. For suppressing innovation in human minds (without killing them)
is a trick that can be achieved only by human action, and it is an ugly business.

This has to be seen in perspective. In the civilization of the West today, we are
shocked by the depravity of, for instance, parents who torture and murder their children
for not faithfully enacting cultural norms. And even more by societies and subcultures
where that is commonplace and considered honorable. And by dictatorships and
totalitarian states that persecute and murder entire harmless populations for behaving
differently. We are ashamed of our own recent past, in which it was honorable to beat
children bloody for mere disobedience. And before that, to own human beings as slaves.
And before that, to burn people to death for being infidels, to the applause and
amusement of the public. Steven Pinker’s book The Better Angels of our Nature contains
accounts of horrendous evils that were normal in historical civilizations. Yet even they

After careful consideration, the Board
is persuaded that the prevailing judicial
view should apply in the NLRA context
as well.148 As an equitable concept,
equitable tolling is a matter of fairness.
The Board has determined that many
employees are unaware of their NLRA
rights and has devised a minimally
burdensome means of attempting to
rectify that situation—requiring
employers to post workplace notices
informing employees of those rights. To
bar an employee who is excusably
unaware of the NLRA from seeking a
remedy for a violation of NLRA rights
because he or she failed to file an unfair
labor practice charge within the 10(b)
period, when the employer did not post
the required notice, would unfairly
deprive the employee of the protection
of the Act because of the employer’s
failure to comply with its legal
responsibilities. To deny equitable
tolling in such circumstances “would
grant to the employee a right to be
informed without redress for violation.”’
Bonham v. Dresser Industries, above,
569 F.2d at 193.149

147 See comments of Harkin and Miller, AFL-CIO,

and Service Employees International Union (SEIU).
148 The Board has broad discretion to interpret
10(b), including equitable tolling, in accordance

with its experience administering the Act. Lodge 64,

IAM v. NLRB, 949 F.2d 441, 444 (D.C. Cir. 1991)
(deferring to the Board’s interpretation of 10(b)
equitable exceptions).

149 Under the final rule, the Board could also find
the failure to post the notice to be an unfair labor
practice, and could, if appropriate, consider a
willful failure to post to be evidence of unlawful
motive in an unfair labor practice case. However,

The Board received many comments
opposing this proposed rule provision.
Several comments assert that, when a
charging party is unaware of the facts
supporting the finding of an unfair labor
practice, the Board tolls the 10(b) period
only when the charged party has
fraudulently concealed those facts from
the charging party.15° That is not so.
The Board has long held, with court
approval, that the 10(b) period begins to
run only when the charging party has
notice that the NLRA has been violated.
The party asserting the 10(b) defense
has the burden to show such notice; it
may do so by showing that the charging
party had either actual or constructive
knowledge of the alleged unfair labor
practice prior to the 10(b) period. See,
e.g., Broadway Volkswagen, 342 NLRB
1244, 1246 (2004), enfd. sub nom. East
Bay Automotive Council v. NLEB, 483
F.2d 628, 634 (9th Cir. 2007); University
Moving & Storage Co., 350 NLRB 6, 7,
18 (2007); John Morrell & Co., above,
304 NLRB at 899; Pullman Building
Company, 251 NLRB 1048 (1980), enfd.
691 F.2d 507 (9th Cir. 1982) (table);
Burgess Construction, 227 NLRB 765,
766 (1977), enfd. 596 F.2d 378 (9th Cir.
1978), cert. denied 440 U.S. 940 (1979).
Knowledge may be imputed if the
charging party would have discovered
the unlawful conduct by exercising
reasonable or due diligence. Broadway
Volkswagen, above, 342 NLRB at 1246.
Certainly, the Board has found it
appropriate to toll the 10(b) period
when the charging party was excusably
unaware of the pertinent facts because
the charged party had fraudulently
concealed them; see, e.g., Burgess
Construction, above, 227 NLRB at 766;
but tolling is not limited to such
circumstances. Pullman Building
Company, above, 251 NLRB at 1048.

To the extent that the comments argue
that the Board should not engage in
equitable tolling of the 10(b) period
when an employer has merely failed to
post the notice but not engaged in
fraudulent concealment,151 the Board
disagrees. Fraudulent concealment
concerns a different kind of equitable
doctrine, and is not directly relevant to
the notice posting equitable tolling
doctrine hereby adopted. See Mercado,
above, 410 F.3d at 46-47 n.8 (employer
misconduct and equitable tolling

in the absence of equitable tolling of the 10(b)
period, such “redress” would not aid an employee
who was excusably unaware of his or her NLRA
rights, failed to file a timely charge, and thus was
denied any remedy for violation of those rights. Cf.
Kanakis Co., 293 NLRB 435, 436 fn. 10 (1989)
(possibility of criminal sanctions against employer
would be little comfort to charging party if deprived
of recourse to Board’s remedial processes).

151 See, e.g., comments of FMI, COLLE.

doctrine form “two distinct lines of
cases applyl[ing] two distinct standards
to two distinct bases for equitable
tolling’).

Some comments argue that because
Section 10(b) contains a limited
exception to the 6-month filing period
for employees in the military, it is
improper for the Board to toll the 10(b)
period under other circumstances.15?
The Board rejects this argument as
foreclosed by the Supreme Court’s
holding in Zipes, above, and by the long
line of Board and court decisions
finding tolling of the 10(b) period
appropriate. In any event, the exception
in Section 10(b) for persons in the
military provides that if the aggrieved
person “was prevented from filing such
charge by reason of service in the armed
forces, in which event the six-month
period shall be computed from the day
of his discharge.’’ This provision does
not toll the six-month period during
armed service; rather, it states that the
six-month period begins at discharge.
See Holland v. Florida, 130 S.Ct. 2549,
2561 (2010) (rejecting argument that
explicit exceptions to time limits in
nonjurisdictional statute of limitations
precluded equitable tolling).15%

A number of comments contend that
tolling the 10(b) period is contrary to the
salutary purpose of statutes of
limitations in general, and 10(b) in
particular, which is “‘to require diligent
prosecution of known claims, thereby
providing finality and predictability in
legal affairs and ensuring that claims
will be resolved while evidence is
reasonably available and fresh.” 154
Black’s Law Dictionary, 9th Edition, at
1546. The Board recognizes that with
the passage of time evidence can be lost
and witnesses die, move away, or their
memories fade; it therefore will not
lightly find that the 10(b) period should
be tolled. However, like the courts
whose decisions are cited above, the
Board also recognizes that equitable
tolling is a fundamental part of the
statute of limitations, and that inequity
results from barring an individual from
seeking relief from a violation of his or
her NLRA rights where the individual
excusably was unaware of these rights.
After all, the purpose of a statute of
limitations is to “require diligent

152 See, e.g., comments of California Chamber and
NCAE.

153 American Bus Association v. Slater, 231 F. 3d
1 (D.C. Cir. 2000), cited by California Chamber and
NCAE, did not concern equitable tolling and is
therefore inapposite. The court there also found that
Congress had expressly limited the sanctions
available under the Americans with Disabilities Act
to those enumerated in that statute; such is not the
case under the NLRA.

Chamber of Commerce.

SUBJECT: Market Value Appraisal 
IGY American Yacht Harbor Marina 
18A-1, 18-61,18-B and 18-W Remainder Estate Smith Bay 
East End Quarter, St. Thomas, Virgin Islands 
Client Reference: 23559 
IRR - Caribbean File No. 172-2015-0181 
Dear Mr. Soltero: 
Integra Realty Resources — Caribbean is pleased to submit the accompanying appraisal of 
the referenced property. The purpose of the appraisal is to develop an opinion of the 
market value of the leased fee (going concern) interest in the property. The client for the 
assignment is Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, and the intended use is for Commercial credit 
administration. 
The appraisal is intended to conform with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal 
Practice (USPAP), the Code of Professional Ethics and Standards of Professional Appraisal 
Practice of the Appraisal Institute, the Principles of Appraisal Practice and Code of Ethics of 
the American Society of Appraisers, the RICS Valuation Professional Standards, the 
International Valuation Standards, applicable jurisdictional appraisal regulations, and the 
appraisal guidelines of Banco Popular de Puerto Rico. The appraisal is also prepared in 
accordance with the appraisal regulations issued in connection with the Financial 
Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA). 
To report the assignment results, we use the Appraisal Report option of Standards Rule 2-
2(a) of USPAP. As USPAP gives appraisers the flexibility to vary the level of information in an 
Appraisal Report depending on the intended use and intended users of the appraisal, we 
Roberto A. Soltero 
Banco Popular de Puerto Rico 
December 15, 2015 
Page 2 
adhere to the Integra Realty Resources internal standards for an Appraisal Report — 
Standard Format. This format summarizes the information analyzed, the appraisal methods 
employed, and the reasoning that supports the analyses, opinions, and conclusions. 
The subject is an existing 250-slip marina with 5 commercial buildings containing a mixture 
of retail and office space types. The buildings contain 48,661 square feet of rentable area 
and were constructed in multiple stages; with the majority of the construction completed in 
1993. The commercial space is 85% leased as of the effective appraisal date. The marina 
docks were constructed in multiple phases between 1991-1995 and are 52.8% occupied as 
of the effective appraisal date. The total site area is 2.76 acres or 120,226 square feet, which 
includes 0.64 acre or 27,878 square feet, that is re-claimed land. The property also includes 
3.2 acres of seabed under the marina dock structures which is leased to the property owner 
from the Government of the Virgin Islands. 
Based on the valuation analysis in the accompanying report, and subject to the definitions, 
assumptions, and limiting conditions expressed in the report, our opinion of value is as 
follows: 
Value Conclusion* 
Appraisal Premise 
Market Value 
Interest Appraised Date of Value Value Conclusion 
Leased Fee (Going Concern) November 25, 2015 $24,360,000 
*Values expressed in United States Dollars 
Allocation of Going Concern Value 
Amount 	% of Total 
Tangible Property 
Land & Improvements 	$24,250,000 	99.5% 
Tangible Personal Property (FF&E) 	$110,000 	0.5%

I nta ngi ble Assets 	$0 	0.0% 
Market Value* 	$24,360,000 	100.0% 
*Specifically excluded from the valuation are cash and equivalents and current liabilities. 
The allocation of value components is based on the going-concern premise, which holds that 
the value of a business as a going-concern is equal to the sum of the values of the tangible 
and intangible assets. The allocation assumes continued operation of the marina business. 
Were the marina business to cease operations, the values of the individual components 
would likely be different from the allocated values of the going concern.

Extraordinary Assumptions and Hypothetical Conditions 
The value conclusions are subject to the following extraordinary assumptions that may affect the assignment 
results. An extraordinary assumption is uncertain information accepted as fact. If the assumption is found to 
be false as of the effective date of the appraisal, we reserve the right to modify our value conclusions. 
1. The subject property has a fueling dock and four fuel storage tanks located on site; including three diesel 
and one gasoline. There were no signs of contamination during our inspection and we have assumed that 
there is no adverse environmental impact in connection with the existing fuel equipment used on the 
subject property. 
2. The parking garage at the subject slightly encroaches on the neighboring property to the immediate 
northwest. This land is owned by the Government of the Virgin Islands and we have assumed that no claim 
will arise from the encroachments. 
3. For this analysis, we have valued the going concern interest in the subject property and have allocated the 
value of the personal property from the value of the real property. We were provided with financial 
statments from ownership that indicates the depreciated book value of these assets. It is beyond our scope 
to value these assets in use; therefore, we have assumed that the book values of teh personal property 
items shown in the statments provided by ownership are reasonably accurate for the purpose of this 
allocation exercise. 
The value conclusions are based on the following hypothetical conditions that may affect the assignment 
results. A hypothetical condition is a condition contrary to known fact on the effective date of the appraisal 
but is supposed for the purpose of analysis. 
1. No hypothetical conditions were employed in this analysis. 
The opinions of value expressed in this report are based on estimates and forecasts that are 
prospective in nature and subject to considerable risk and uncertainty. Events may occur 
that could cause the performance of the property to differ materially from our estimates, 
such as changes in the economy, interest rates, capitalization rates, financial strength of 
tenants, and behavior of investors, lenders, and consumers. Additionally, our opinions and 
forecasts are based partly on data obtained from interviews and third party sources, which 
are not always completely reliable. Although we are of the opinion that our findings are 
reasonable based on available evidence, we are not responsible for the effects of future 
occurrences that cannot reasonably be foreseen at this time.

General Information 4 
Purpose of the Appraisal 
The purpose of the appraisal is to develop an opinion of the market value of the leased fee (going 
concern) interest in the property as of the effective date of the appraisal, November 25, 2015. The 
date of the report is December 15, 2015. The appraisal is valid only as of the stated effective date or 
dates. 
Basis of Value 
Market value is defined as: 
The most probable price which a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all 
conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller each acting prudently and knowledgeably, and 
assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus. Implicit in this definition is the consummation of 
a sale as of a specified date and the passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby: 
• Buyer and seller are typically motivated; 
• Both parties are well informed or well advised, and acting in what they consider their own 
best interests; 
• A reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market; 
• Payment is made in terms of cash in U.S. dollars or in terms of financial arrangements 
comparable thereto; and 
• The price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected by special or 
creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale.

Evaluation Guidelines, Federal Register, 75 FR 77449, December 10, 2010, page 77472) 
Definition of Property Rights Appraised 
Leased fee interest is defined as, A freehold (ownership interest) where the possessory interest has 
been granted to another party by creation of a contractual landlord-tenant relationship (i.e., a lease). 
Lease is defined as, A contract in which rights to use and occupy land or structures are transferred by 
the owner to another for a specified period of time in return for a specified rent. 
(Source: The Dictionary of Real Estate Appraisal, Fifth Edition, Appraisal Institute, Chicago, Illinois, 
2010) 
Definition of Going-Concern Premise 
Going-Concern Premise is defined as, one of the premises under which the total assets of a business 
can be valued; the assumption that a company is expected to continue operating well into the future 
(usually indefinitely). Under the going-concern premise, the value of a business as a going concern is 
equal to the sum of the value of the tangible assets and the value of the intangible assets, which may 
IGY American Yacht Harbor Marina

include the value of excess profit, where asset values are derived consistently with the going-concern 
premise.

Intended Use and User 
The intended use of the appraisal is for Commercial credit administration. The client and intended 
user is Banco Popular de Puerto Rico. The appraisal is not intended for any other use or user. No party 
or parties other than Banco Popular de Puerto Rico may use or rely on the information, opinions, and 
conclusions contained in this report. 
Applicable Requirements 
This appraisal is intended to conform to the requirements of the following: 
• Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP); 
• Code of Professional Ethics and Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice of the Appraisal 
Institute; 
• The Principles of Appraisal Practice and Code of Ethics of the American Society of Appraisers 
• The RICS Valuation Professional Standards; 
• The International Valuation Standards of the IVSC; 
• Applicable jurisdictional regulations; 
• Appraisal requirements of Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and 
Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), revised June 7, 1994; 
• Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines issued December 10, 2010; 
• Appraisal guidelines of Banco Popular de Puerto Rico. 
Prior Services 
USPAP requires appraisers to disclose to the client any other services they have provided in 
connection with the subject property in the prior three years, including valuation, consulting, property 
management, brokerage, or any other services. The RICS Red Book also contains requirements for 
valuers to disclose previous involvement with the subject property within twelve months. We have 
not performed any services, as an appraiser or in any other capacity, regarding the property that is the 
subject of this report within the three-year period immediately preceding acceptance of this 
assignment. 
Competency 
We hereby confirm that we possess adequate knowledge and skills to perform the assignment 
competently, including an understanding area/regional market conditions, and factors which pertain 
to the property type in question. 
IGY American Yacht Harbor Marina 
General Information 6 
Independence 
We hereby confirm that we have no conflicts of interest or material involvement in the property which 
is the subject of this valuation; and that we are acting as unbiased, independent, external valuers. 
RICS Valuer Registration 
We confirm that we are in compliance with the RICS Valuer Registration program, which is mandatory 
for RICS members in the Caribbean region. 
Currency 
Unless otherwise stated, all financial figures in this report are expressed in United States Dollars. 
Scope of Work 
To determine the appropriate scope of work for the assignment, we considered the intended use of 
the appraisal, the needs of the user, the complexity of the property, and other pertinent factors. Our 
concluded scope of work is described below. 
Valuation Methodology 
Appraisers usually consider the use of three approaches to value when developing a market value 
opinion for real property. These are the cost approach, sales comparison approach, and income 
capitalization approach. Use of the approaches in this assignment is summarized as follows: 
Approaches to Value 
Approach 
Applicability to Subject Use in Assignment 
Cost Approach Not Applicable Not Utilized 
Sales Comparison Approach Not Applicable Not Utilized 
Income Capitalization Approach Applicable Utilized 
The income capitalization approach is the most reliable valuation method for the subject due to the 
following: 
• The probable buyer of the subject would base a purchase price decision primarily on the 
income generating potential of the property and an anticipated rate of return. 
• Sufficient market data regarding income, expenses, and rates of return, is available for 
analysis. 
The sales comparison approach is not applicable to the subject because: 
• This approach does not reflect the primary analysis undertaken by a typical investor-
purchaser. 
• There are insufficient sales of comparable properties in this market from which to derive a 
credible value conclusion. 
The cost approach is not applicable to the subject considering the following: 
IGY American Yacht Harbor Marina 
General Information 7 
• The age of the property makes estimates of accrued depreciation very subjective. 
• This approach is not typically used by market participants, except for new properties. 
Research and Analysis 
The type and extent of our research and analysis is detailed in individual sections of the report. This 
includes the steps we took to verify comparable sales, which are disclosed in the comparable sale 
profile sheets in the addenda to the report. Although we make an effort to confirm the arms-length 
nature of each sale with a party to the transaction, it is sometimes necessary to rely on secondary 
verification from sources deemed reliable. 
Inspection 
Mark J. Weathers conducted an interior and exterior inspection of the property on November 25, 
2015. James V. Andrews, MAI, CRE, FRICS, ASA, CVA, also conducted an interior and exterior

A mild tropical climate, scenic beauty, and status as a U.S. territory make Virgin Islands appealing for 
vacationers from United States and Europe. The islands host over 2.5 million visitors per year, most of 
whom arrive by cruise ship, and tourism is the dominant economic engine of the islands, accounting 
for roughly 70 percent of the total gross territorial product. 
Each district has its own distinct landscape, mix and intensity of land uses, cultural identity, and 
prospects for future development. St Thomas is home to the capital and the territory's largest city, 
Charlotte Amalie, which has an estimated population of roughly 19,000 persons. St Thomas is the 
primary center for resort tourism, government, finance, trade, and commerce, but its rugged 
landscape limits the land available for agriculture and other types of land-intensive development. 
Charlotte Amalie is also home to a major deepwater harbor that is along major shipping routes to the 
Panama Canal, and it is just east of the Cyril E King International Airport — one of the busiest airports in 
Caribbean. St. Thomas has two cruise ship docks, and is the most frequented cruise ship port in the 
Caribbean. 
The island of St John is just under 3 miles to the east of St Thomas. Cruz Bay is located on the western 
coast of the island and serves as its primary port and link to St Thomas. Nearly two thirds of St John is 
owned by the National Park Service and is off-limits to commercial development. 
St Croix is largest of the three islands, in both land area and population. It is roughly 45 miles to the 
south of St Thomas. Its primary towns are Christiansted and Frederiksted. Overall the island is flatter 
and has more land available for additional agricultural, commercial and residential development than 
St Thomas. St Croix is also the primary manufacturing center for the Virgin Islands, with rum 
distilleries, a major watch-assembly plant, and; until February 2012, one of the world's largest 
petroleum refineries (which recently ceased refining operations). 
History 
The Virgin Islands were originally settled by the Ciboney, Carib, and Arawaks. The islands were named 
by Christopher Columbus on his second voyage in 1493 for Saint Ursula and her virgin followers. Over 
the next three hundred years, the islands were held by many European powers, including Spain, 
England, the Netherlands, France, and Denmark-Norway. The Danes developed the islands with 
plantation estates, and the estates boundaries are still used in legal descriptions for land to this day. 
The U.S. took possession of the islands on March 31, 1917 and the territory was renamed the Virgin 
Islands of the United States. U.S. citizenship was granted to the inhabitants of the islands in 1927. 
Government 
The U.S. Virgin Islands are an organized, unincorporated United States territory. Even though they are 
U.S. citizens, Virgin Islands residents cannot vote in presidential elections. Virgin Islands residents, 
however, are able to vote in presidential primary elections for delegates to the Democratic National 
Convention and the Republican National Convention. 
The main political parties in the U.S. Virgin Islands are the Democratic Party of the Virgin Islands, the 
Independent Citizens Movement, and the Republican Party of the Virgin Islands. Additional candidates 
run as independents.

At the national level, the U.S. Virgin Islands elects a delegate to Congress from its at-large 
congressional district. However, the elected delegate, while able to vote in committee, cannot 
participate in floor votes. 
At the territorial level, 15 senators-seven from the district of Saint Croix, seven from the district of 
Saint Thomas and Saint John, and one senator at-large who must be a resident of Saint John-are 
elected for two-year terms to the unicameral Virgin Islands Legislature. The U.S. Virgin Islands has 
elected a territorial governor every four years since 1970. Previous governors were appointed by the 
President of the United States. 
Population and Employment 
In 2008, the residential population of the Virgin Islands peaked at an estimated 115,852 persons. This 
follows five years of slow but steady growth of 1.0%, slightly slower than the U.S. annual average of 
1.15%. Since 2008, population levels have fallen each year, to the 2014 estimated population of 
103,961 persons. 
Among the three islands, St Croix and St Thomas are nearly equally populous with St John having less 
than 4 percent of the total population of the Virgin Islands.

The territory's Labor Force has also declined slightly, and there has been a steady increase in the 
unemployment rate; which was further affected by the closure of the Hovensa oil and gas refinery in 
2012. Note that there was a slight dip in unemployement in 2014.

Industry 
The territory relies heavily on tourism for economic stability. Additional industries include the 
production and export of rum; and until early 2012, the production of refined petroleum products (the 
Hovensa Refinery in St. Croix closed in early 2012). The Gross Domestic Product peaked in 2007 at 
$4.85 million, and declined to $4.14 million in 2012, and further declined to $3.79 million for 2013. 
Personal income per capita is also in decline from over $25,000 in 2010 and 2011 to just over $21,000 
in 2013.

The closure of the Hovensa refinery, which was one of the territory's largest employers, also had a 
significant impact on exports which were prevously dominated by petrolium products. Otherwise, the 
territory predominently relies on the tourism industry to support the economy.

Over ninety percent of non-farm jobs are in the service providing industries, with the remaining jobs 
being in goods producing industries. Government, trade, transportation and utilities, and leisure and 
hospitality remain the industries with the largest number of jobs. 
These three sectors account for 69 percent of all jobs. Professional and business services, construction 
and financial activities account for approximately 9 percent, 4 percent and 6 percent respectively. 
Manufacturing and information sectors account for about 2 percent each, while educational and 
health services account for 6 percent. Other services account for the remainder of jobs. 
Tourism 
The total number of visitor arrivals to the territory reached over 2.8 million in 2014, including both air 
and cruise ship arrivals. This represents 4.2% growth over the prior year. Total visitor expenditures 
are also growing, with annual growth in excess of 6% each of the last three years.

It is apparent, however, that the amount of visitor expenditures from cruise ship passengers has not 
increased linearly with arrivals since 2009; whereby the ratio was more linear in prior years. Cruise 
passenger arrivals grew 4.94% to over 2.08 million in 2014 following growth of 5.37% in the prior year. 
Total expenditures from cruise ship visitors grew 3.73% to over $345 million in 2013, following growth 
of 6.7% in 2012.

In terms of stopover tourists, the U.S. Virgin Islands ranks 7th in the list of the top tourism markets in 
the Caribbean, with 2014 stay-over arrivals of about 730,000. The year 2014 indicated modest growth 
in arrivals, with 3.90% growth over the prior period. The chart below illustrates the relationship 
between arrivals and GDP. We note that the continuing downturn in GDP is likely due to negative 
influences outside the tourism sector, such as the 2012 closure of the Hovensa oil refinery in St. Croix.

mahogany Run area, and the 300-room, proposed Hyatt Regency in Mandal Bay. In addition, a hotel 
project was recently announced on Water Island; however, the developers have not yet announced a 
brand or number of proposed rooms. 
Housing / Property 
As the supply of housing has increased in the last two decades, homeownership rates have also 
increased, although only slightly. Rates increased 1.9 percentage points between 2000 and 2010, and 
increased an additional 3.8 percentage points from 2010 to 2012. Average home prices dropped by 
11.8 percent in 2008, but then increased in 2009 and 2010 by 4 percent and 12.3 percent, 
respectively. In 2012, average home prices fell 17.4% and then rebounded in 2013 with an increase of 
22.1%. The average sales price in 2013 was $538,369. Presumably, much of the increased supply of 
new homes and condominiums has gone to non-residents and vacationers. Over the past decade, 
housing costs have accelerated at a far greater pace than resident incomes, putting home ownership 
beyond the reach of all but a few relatively wealthy islanders. 
In 2013, St. Thomas and St. John had an average home sale price of $713,183, while the average home 
sale price in St. Croix was $306,083. While prices have not caught up with what they were in 2007, St. 
Thomas and St. John have seen some recovery in the overall housing market. St. Croix, however, 
continues to suffer from the closing of the Hovensa refinery. In 2014, the average single family home 
sales price in St. Croix was $334,167, while in St. Thomas it was $909,839. 2015 year to date averages 
are show an increase in average single family home price in St. Croix and a decrease in St. Thomas and 
St. John, with averages of $414,178 and $759,811 respectively.

The current situation is that the recovering housing market and general economic conditions on the 
US mainland is slowly having a positive impact in the US Virgin Islands' real estate market in terms of 
overall average home prices as well as the number of homes sold. Home sales in the territory, while 
still lower than 2007 figures, have increased annually since 2012. 
According to statistical data provided by the Multiple Listing Service, the value of real estate sales in 
the St. Thomas-St. Croix MLS grew by 54% in 2014 to nearly $200 million on 883 transactions; volume 
seen since 2008 and sales pace not seen since 2007. This growth follows 20% growth in 2013 which 
came after six years of declines. The average sales price surpassed $300,000, a level also not seen 
since 2008.

Real Estate Ownership and Taxation 
Ownership is fee simple, under the U.S. flag. There are no restrictions against purchasing solely for 
investment, and no laws dictating when, if ever, you must build on undeveloped land. It should be 
noted that for 2006 there was a reassessment, and the tax rate changed to $3.77 per $1,000 based on 
100% of assessed value (for residential property); however, there was an ongoing court challenge to 
the reassessment, and a federal injunction blocked tax bills until the issue could be resolved. As of 
December, 2013, the 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax bills have all been issued under 
the old 1999 assessed values and tax rates. This federal court injunction regarding the tax 
reassessment of VI property values had previously prevented the government from collecting property 
tax for at least four years, resulting in the government losing US$25 million a month. New assessed 
values as well as amended tax rates were released in conjunction with the 2013 tax bills in August, 
2014. Subsequent tax bills were issued at a rate of two per year until August 2015 when the 2015 bill 
were released and the Virgin Islands became current with respect to its property taxes.

Notable News and Developments 
• On January 18, 2012, it was announced that the Hovensa refinery would be permanently shut 
down. This has had a major impact causing an economic downturn on the island, leaving 1,158 
former Hovensa workers unemployed and many more employed by the company's 
contractors according to the United States Department of Labor. Recently, an auction of 
Hovensa's assets was conducted in New York City with multiple qualified bidders, and the 
assets were awarded to Limetree Bay Holdings, a subsidiary of ArcLight Capital Partners. 
Pending approval by the Virgin Islands legislature, ArcLight's operation of the oil storage 
facility will create a minimum of 80 jobs, with the possibility of more in the future. ArcLight 
indicated there could be a possibility of a limited restart of some refinery units at some point 
in the future. 
• Both the Senate and the US House of Representatives passed the Coast Guard Reauthorization 
Act, and President Obama signed the act into legislation in the fiscal year 2015 which should 
help level the charter yacht industry playing field. Prior to 1993 and the imposition of a six-
passenger limitation on US uninspected vessels, the charter yacht industry in the US Virgin 
Islands was thriving, contributing over $100 million in annual revenue and hundreds of jobs to 
the local economy. A large chunk of the industry moved to the British Virgin Islands after the 
six-passenger rule limitation was initiated by the US Government. The bill has recently been 
enacted into law, and the ability of the USVI to compete in this industry should be significantly 
improved. 
• After an extensive search and vetting process, the USVI Government has selected a group of 
local and regional investors to develop a hotel resort on Water Island, just off of St. Thomas. 
There are apparently eight hotel brands in discussions with the developers for branding the 
property. 
• A Texas-based EB-5 Regional Center has announced an EB-5 funded commercial project 
known as the Port of Mandahl Caribbean Conference Resort. When completed, the 
development is reportedly planned to include two full-service hotels, a golf course, a state of 
the art conference center, retail and commercial space, and high-end residential units. EB-5 is 
a type of economic citizenship program whereby the United States grants citizenship to 
investors of certain approved projects in areas where the economic boost is needed. Regional 
Centers are tasked with selling the investments such as limited partnerships to international 
buyers. 
• The Margaritaville (Wyndham) Vacation Club is under construction in Water Bay on the East 
End of the island of St. Thomas. The project is a renovation of the 290-room Renaissance 
IGY American Yacht Harbor Marina 
19 
Area Analysis 20 
Grand Beach Resort into 262 timeshare oriented condominium units. The first phase on this 
project was completed in September 2015 and is open, while the second phase is currently 
under construction. 
• The University of the Virgin Islands has announced plans to develop a medical school on St. 
Thomas, which will be operated in collaboration between the hospitals on St. Thomas and St. 
Croix. 
Conclusions 
Economic conditions in the U.S. Virgin Islands appear to be slower to recover than many areas of the 
region, particularly in St. Croix, where industrial development had previously been more of a focus 
than tourism The closure of the Hovensa refinery and the failure to facilitate a sale to a buyer who can 
re-open the facility as a refinery will continue to plague St. Croix until other new developments occur 
that can create new jobs. The assets of the refinery were recently sold at auction, but operating 
agreement with the USVI Government only states the buyers will use the oil storage portion in 
addition to constructing an asphalt plant on the property, which projects to only 80 jobs created in the 
immediate future. There appears to be ongoing resurgence in tourism for St. Thomas and St. John, and 
real estate activity appears to be improving; however, many businesses — even those catering to cruise 
ship passengers — continue to struggle. Our forecast is for continued improvement in arrivals and 
hotel statistics, but only gradual economic improvement for the overall territory.

Surrounding Area Analysis 
Location 
The subject is located in the town of Red Hook in the East End area of the Island known as Estate 
Smith Bay. Red Hook is one of the three primary business districts on the island. 
Access and Linkages 
Primary access to the area is provided by Route 32 (Smith Bay Road), a major arterial that crosses the 
east end of the island in a generally east-west direction. This is the primary route through the town of 
Red Hook, one of the three major commercial centers of the island; with the others being the city of 
Charlotte Amalie and the Tutu area. Overall, vehicular access is good. 
Public transportation is provided by Safari Taxi and provides access to all relevant areas. The local 
market perceives public transportation as average compared to other areas in the region. However, 
the primary mode of transportation in this area is the automobile. 
The Red Hook Ferry Terminal offers passenger ferries and car barges on regular schedules to and from 
St. John. Passenger ferry service to the British Virgin Islands is also available. 
The Cyril E. King International Airport is located about 8.4 miles from the property; travel time is about 
25 minutes, depending on traffic conditions. The Charlotte Amalie CBD, the economic and cultural 
center of the island, is approximately 7.0 miles from the property. 
Demand Generators 
The demand for commercial space in the area of the subject is fueled by the popularity of the Red 
Hook business district. Red Hook is a centralized area serving the east end of St. Thomas, and features 
marinas, restaurants, bars, retail shops, and office space. 
The demand for office space in the area has been down due to overall economic conditions. As the 
economy continues its recovery, the demand for well-located office space will increase as well. Retail 
space; however, has seen an increase in demand in this area over the past 12-24 months as shown by 
the low vacancy in the 3 major retail properties Red Hook; American Yacht Harbor (subject), Red Hook 
Plaza and Galleria Shopping Center. 
Compared to the territory area as a whole, the local area has higher income levels. Population trends 
are similar except that the local area is growing at a faster rate than the territory. 
Land Use 
The area is suburban in character and approximately 65% developed. 
Predominant land uses are retail and office uses, with some residential users nearby. Marina use is 
also prevalent in this area. The area contains several neighborhood retail/office centers within a few 
blocks of the subject along Smith Bay Road. These include East End Plaza which is three stories and 
contains mostly office space, the aforementioned Galleria Shopping center which will is anchored by a 
newly opened gourmet grocery store, and the aforementioned Red Hook Plaza which is a two story 
IGY American Yacht Harbor Marina 
Surrounding Area Analysis 23 
building with a mixture of office and retail. There are other small retail commercial buildings both 
along the waterfront and the inland side of the road; such as restaurants, bars and a convenience 
store/gas outlet. 
In addition to the drawing power of these retail users, the lvanna Eudora Kean High School is located 
approximately 1,500 feet west of the subject property. 
During the last several years, development has been predominantly of retail/office uses. The largest 
recent development in this area has been East End Plaza, which was constructed in 2008. However, 
the completion of this commercial building coincided with the downturn in the overall economy in the 
territory, and the property has struggled to reach stabilization. There is also a newly constructed, 
small commercial strip center in close proximity to the subject called Crosswinds Center that opened 
approximately two years ago. Ace Hardware is the anchor tenant in this building, while the majority of 
the other commercial bays remain vacant. 
There have also been two notable bar/restaurant openings within the past two years, both at the 
subject property. Near the subject, a Senor Frogs restaurant opened in November 2013 featuring a 
dining and nightclub atmosphere. Additionally, a tavern/restaurant called Tap & Still has opened 
approximately 450 feet southwest of the subject. A new Thai/Sushi restaurant is under construction 
within Red Hook Plaza, just west of the subject. These new establishments are indicative of the 
improving retail/commercial climate of the Red Hook area. 
Outlook and Conclusions 
The area is in the slow growth stage of its life cycle. There have been signs of increased demand as 
existing commercial space has been leasing up more rapidly over the past six months, showing the 
upside of the subject's area. We anticipate that property values will slightly increase in the near 
future.

Marina Market Analysis 25 
Marina Market Analysis 
Marinas are not at all homogenous, and the various combinations of business and physical 
components result in significantly different results for the owners and operators. The two major types 
of marinas are coastal (usually found in saltwater inland waterways that lead to an ocean port), and 
freshwater (found on lakes). Saltwater marinas tend to attract larger vessels and require a completely 
different level of maintenance. Freshwater marinas typically cater more toward day-sailors and day-
boaters who do not have personal space with which to keep their boats. 
Typical marinas in both coastal and freshwater locations can include any combination of the following 
components: 
• Wet Slips (covered and uncovered) 
• Dry Storage (land) 
• Dry Storage (stack) 
• Maintenance and Repair Yard and Services 
• Marine Dealerships (boat sales) 
• Merchandise Sales (fishing, boating, sundries) 
• Fuel Sales (gas and diesel) 
• Equipment Rental 
With regard to slip rentals (wet and dry), these spaces can be either rented (the traditional route), or 
sold as dockominiums and rackaminiums. The sellout component became very popular in the last 
decade, and many marinas were converted to all or part sellout type enterprises. Part of the reason is 
that developers in recent times prefer to develop real estate for sale (condominiums or homesites) 
that surround the marina, and in turn could sell the boat spaces and then move on to another 
investment. The market for dockominiums (wet and dry) somewhat dried up during the recent 
recession, and many of the unsold units were subsequently rented instead of sold. 
Another trend of development prior to the 2008 recession was for marinas within luxury resort 
communities that also have a residential component. These include 4 and 5-star resorts in the 
subtropical USA as well as the Caribbean. Typical luxury resort developments planned in the last 
decade would include a hotel (which the developer would license to a branded operator), 
condominiums and villas for sale, home sites for sale, and recreational components such as a golf 
course and marina. The sellout types of dock spaces fit well into the business model of the developer, 
as they sell other components and license the hotel operation to a separate entity. 
Marinas also vary in size from small mom and pop or lifestyle businesses with less than 50 slips to 
large enterprises that attract institutional purchasers. Across the board, marinas are affected by 
economic downturns due to the leisure component of the boating hobby. During the last two 
recessions (2000-2003 and 2008-2009), many marinas went into foreclosure. This created difficulty for 
marinas to obtain financing. 
irr. 
IGY American Yacht Harbor Marina 
Marina Market Analysis 26 
Coastal marinas along the eastern seaboard were fairly successful until the recent recession, with 
many documenting 100% occupancy or waiting lists. This may be partly due to increased 
environmental regulation limiting dredging new bodies of water or deepening existing ones. As 
marinas are typically close to inlets leading to the sea or inland waterways, they are typically in areas 
that are rich with aquatic life. 
National Boating Trends 
Because of the age, size, design, tenancy, quality, and location of the subject, it is likely to appeal to 
investors primarily on a national or regional basis. While national factors may or may not be indicative 
of the subject's market area, the national trends exhibited are generally indicative of movement in all 
submarkets. Real estate is typically analyzed on a market-by-market basis. Published secondary data 
and market studies for the marina industry on a local or regional level are scarce. Nationwide, the 
most comprehensive statistical reference guide for the marina industry is the Recreational Boating 
Statistical Abstract, published annually by the National Marine Manufacturers Association (NMMA). 
The most recent publication reports 2014 data. 
According to NMMA, the boating industry generated $35.4 billion in sales and services in 2013, a 3.5% 
decline from 2013. This represented the first year of decline after three consecutive years of growth 
following the low point in 2010, of $30.4 billion, from the great recession. The peak occurred in 2006 
at $39.5 billion. 
Of the 242.5 million adults living in the United States in 2014, 35.7%, or 87.3 million people, 
participated in recreational boating; a 1.8% decline from 2013. This is within the range of participation 
over the past four years which varies from 34.8% to 37.8% of the population. 
New boat sales peaked at 912,130 in 2006, but have declined since that date with 2014 sales at 
534,500 units, an increase of 0.44% from 2013. Before the recession in 2007, fuel prices increased, 
followed by increased unemployment and tightening credit. Luxury and leisure goods such as boats 
are typically the first things to be put on the back burner as people become more discretionary with 
their income. As a result, pre-owned power boat represented 64% of all boat sales during 2014, and 
new boat dealers have had to compete. 
While boating participation declined recently, boat registrations have fallen. Boat registrations were 
up 0.08% to 12 million in 2014 versus 11.99 million in 2013. Florida led all states in boat registrations 
for 2014 followed by California, Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin, in that order. 
The demographic of boat owners is largely middle class. In 2014, 95% of registered mechanically 
propelled boats were 26 feet or less, indicating more affordable, entry-level, trailerable boats. The 
majority (71.5%) of boat owners earn an average household income under $100,000. Over 60% of 
boating participants were between the age of 31 and 64 which signifies that the increase in boating 
population is younger. 
National Marina Industry 
Every December/January, Marina Dock Age magazine publishes an issue dedicated to trends in the 
marina industry. An article from the most recent issue in December 2014 indicates that the majority of 
IGY American Yacht Harbor Marina 
Marina Market Analysis 27 
marinas and boatyards continue to improve net profits, overall revenues, and occupancy rates, with 
82% expecting stable or increasing occupancy rates.

Marina Dock Age publishes statistical information based on the percentage of overall respondents. 
The subject is under private ownership and has 98 boat slips which are expected to be increased to 
108 slips. The largest majority (31%) of private owner marinas reported 85% to 94% occupancy rates. 
Overall, 58% of private owners reported occupancy rates of 85% to 100%. The largest majority (32%) 
of small marinas reported occupancy rates of 100%, with 70% of small marinas reporting occupancy of 
85% to 100%. The largest majority of medium marinas (26%) reported occupancy rates of 85% to 94%, 
with 57% of medium marinas reporting occupancy of 85% to 100%.

Conclusion 
The majority of respondents indicated stable to increasing occupancy rates in 2014 over 2013. Most 
respondents had an occupancy rate above 85%. Most respondents also indicated increased revenues. 
These are all positive indications for the marina industry. 
An article in Marina Dock Trends states that the market is improving for marina properties. The article 
reports that pre-recession, marina capitalization rates were around 5% to 6%. Post-recession through 
May 2014, capitalization rates were around 10%. Since May 2014, capitalization rates for marinas 
began decreasing. 
Though the boating industry experienced a decline in revenue and participation during the recession, 
demand for slips far exceeds the current supply. Many industry experts as well as local brokers in 
IGY American Yacht Harbor Marina 
irr 
Marina Market Analysis 30 
marina sales have indicated that now is a good time to invest in a marina, despite the previous 
recession and limited financing. 
Competitive Marinas 
The most significant supply and demand indicators for the subject are rental and occupancy rates 
experienced by directly competing properties. The operation of a pleasure craft marina provides 
revenue sources which include a mix of various rental, sales and services for the pleasure craft 
operators. Principle revenue stream for pleasure craft marinas includes in-water slips, fuel sales, and 
building rent. 
The subject's asking and average contract rates are shown in the table that follows. The current 
operator is leasing the marina slips by linear feet of vessel length. We have then converted this rental 
income into a rental rate per linear foot of dock space. The subject offers slip rental on a daily, weekly, 
monthly, seasonal and annual basis. The contracted rental rates represent a blend of these rates, from 
daily tenants to long term tenants on annual leases. According to management, approximately 60% of 
the occupants at any given time are seasonal or annual tenants.

We weren't provided with a current rent roll for the marina slips but we were provided with monthly 
historical occupancy and rental rate data. With the transient nature of marina tenants, a historical 
rent and occupancy figures are a more accurate indication of the income properties of the marina. 
Rental rates at the subject, and in this market, are based on a rate per linear foot of vessel length. As 
discussed earlier, the subject contains 105 wet slips with a total of 5,680 linear feet of rentable dock 
space, which indicates a total of 2,073,200 rentable linear feet per year. 
As of the effective valuation date, the subject marina has experienced an overall occupancy rate of 
56.3% for the year to date 2015. We have looked at occupancy rates on an average, annual basis due 
to the seasonal characteristics of this property type in this market. Again, due to the transient nature 
of the tenants in this property type and the short term nature of the leases which can range from daily 
to annually, the overall occupancy rate will be lower than other commercial property types such as 
lodging, multifamily, retail and office. The subject's current occupancy rate is slightly lower than 
historical rates, but the property is considered to be at stabilized occupancy. 
The weighted average contract rate is $37.29 per linear foot per month for the year to date 2015, 
which equates to an average contract rate of $447.50 per linear foot per year.

Marina Market Analysis 35 
Of the comparable marinas in St. Thomas, Yacht Haven Grande is the most superior in terms of 
location, quality and amenities. This marina is typically geared to extremely large vessels such as 
mega-yachts. Crown Bay Marina is slightly inferior to Yacht Haven Grande, but is still superior to the 
subject in quality and amenities. Sapphire Beach Resort, Compass Point and Oasis Cove are all 
considered to be inferior marinas to the subject based on location, quality and amenities offered. 
These marinas mostly cater to live-aboards and smaller vessels. 
The most comparable properties are located in the British Virgin Islands (BVI). Nany Cay and Virgin 
Gorda Yacht Harbor are slightly superior to Soper's Hole, but they are all similar in quality and 
amenities as the subject property. The location of the subject in St. Thomas, and its specific location 
within St. Thomas, is considered superior based on convenience. 
The majority of the subject's wet slips (98 out of 105) allow for vessels less than 80'. In this size range, 
the comparable marinas in St. Thomas range from $199.32 - $1,314 with an average of $578.38 per 
linear foot. The comparable marinas in the BVI range from $419.75 - $912.50 with an average of 
$587.65 per linear foot in this size range. The subject's asking rates for this size vessel averages 
approximately $565.75, which is slightly below average but reasonable.

It appears based the land survey provided that a portion of the building improvements does not meet 
the setback requirements by zoning and that the subject is a legal, nonconforming use. However, we

are not experts in the interpretation of zoning ordinances. An appropriately qualified land use 
attorney should be engaged if a determination of compliance with zoning is required. 
The subject is located within a 100-year floodplain related to coastal flooding, which would require 
additional insurance at the expense of the owner. 
The subject site has 765 linear feet of frontage along Smith Bay Road. In addition, the subject has 846 
linear feet of water frontage along Vessup Bay. There is no beach along the waterfront portion; with 
the coastline being that of existing and former mangroves. It is assumed that dredging occurred at 
some point in time which enabled dockage in close proximity to the water line. 
Easements, Encroachments and Restrictions 
Based upon a review of the deed and property survey, there do not appear to be any easements, 
encroachments, or restrictions that would adversely affect value. According to the property survey 
provided, the subject parking garage encroaches the neighboring parcel to the north in two separate 
areas: an 82 square foot area encroaches onto Parcel 18N-1-A A, and a 105 square foot area 
encroaches onto Parcel 18B-2 A. These areas are small in size and the parcels being encroached upon 
are uneconomic remnants of land owned by the Government of the Virgin Islands. As a result, these 
encroachments do not have an adverse effect on the overall value of the subject. Our valuation 
assumes no adverse impacts from easements, encroachments, or restrictions, and further assumes 
that the subject has clear and marketable title. 
Conclusion of Land Analysis 
Overall, the physical characteristics of the site and the availability of utilities result in functional utility 
suitable for a variety of uses including those permitted by zoning. The subject's location along Smith 
Bay Road in the heart of Red Hook, along with its extensive water frontage on Vessup Bay, are major 
drivers of demand and value for marina and commercial use on the site. We are not aware of any 
other particular restrictions on development.

The subject property contains a total GBA of 72,808 and a rentable area of 
48,652. The large difference in area totals is due to a sigi nifi cant amount of 
exterior common areas as well as a 1,406 SF management office. The 
improvements are contained within five total buildings varying from one 
story to three stories. Each building contains a mixutre of retail and office 
space, with the retail spaces generally on the ground levels and the office 
spaces generally on the upper levels. The interior upfits of the spaces vary in 
use, quality and condition but generally are considered to be of good quality 
and condition. Based on the rent roll there are a total of 39 rentable spaces of 
which 10 are upfit as bar/restaurants (3 which share a kitchen), 17 are 
considered general retail spaces, 11 are considered general office spaces and 
one is considered a storage space.

Improvements Analysis — Building Improvements 
Quality and Condition 
The quality and condition of the subject is considered to be superior to that of competing properties. 
The interior and exterior building improvements are considered to be of good quality and in good 
condition based on our inspection. 
Functional Utility 
The improvements appear to be adequately suited to their current use, and there do not appear to be 
any significant items of functional obsolescence. 
Deferred Maintenance 
A few items of deferred maintenance were identified during our inspection and based on discussions 
with management. These include repairs and replacement to the parking garage ceiling, replacing the 
wooden deck on the upper level Building A, and re-facing various portions of the marina jettys. Note 
that a detailed description of the marina improvements will be discussed in the following section of 
this report. To estimate the cost to cure deferred maintenance, we rely on construction estimates 
from management as shown below. 
Deferred Maintenance 
Item 	Estimated Cost 
Parking garage ceiling 	$40,000 
Wooden deck repair/replacement 	$25,000 
Marina decking and fenderi ng repair/replace 	$96,000 
Total 	$161,000 
*Values expressed in United States Dollars 
Planned Capital Expenditures 
From 2013 to 2015, a total of $771,460.93 has been spent on various capital expenditures. The major 
improvements over the past three years were $84,088 for exterior column replacement, $62,172 for 
security cameras, $62,013 for marina bathrooms, and $281,950 for hand rail replacement. Upcoming 
expenditures for various capital items considered to be necessary are identified in the following table. 
To estimate the amounts of these expenditures, we rely on discussions with management. Estimated 
capital expenditures are as follows.

*Values expressed in United States Dollars 
ADA Compliance 
Based on our inspection and information provided, we are not aware of any ADA issues. However, we 
are not expert in ADA matters, and further study by an appropriately qualified professional would be 
recommended to assess ADA compliance. 
Hazardous Substances 
An environmental assessment report was not provided for review and environmental issues are 
beyond our scope of expertise. No hazardous substances were observed during our inspection of the 
improvements; however, we are not qualified to detect such substances. There are three 10,000 
gallon diesel storage tanks and one 10,000 gallon gasoline storage tank located unground at the 
subject site. In addition, there is a marine fueling dock located on the marina. We have assumed there 
is no environment damage to the subject property as the result of these fuel stations and unless 
otherwise stated, we assume no hazardous conditions exist on or near the subject. 
Personal Property 
No personal property items were observed that would have any material contribution to market 
value. 
Conclusion of Improvements Analysis 
In comparison to other competitive properties in the region, the subject improvements are rated as 
follows: 
Improvements Ratings 
Visibility/Exposure Above Average 
Design and Appearance Above Average 
Age/Condition Above Average 
Adaptability of Space to other Retail Users Above Average

IGY American Yacht Harbor Marina 
Improvements Description and Analysis 46 
Overall, the quality, condition, and functional utility of the improvements are above average for their 
age and location. The subject benefits from good access and visibility from both the waterfront and 
the main thoroughfare of Smith Bay Road. In addition, the overall quality and condition of the subject 
is above average for this market. Due to the small site size and large number of commercial tenants, 
there is insufficient parking at the subject based on market standards. 
Improvement Analysis — Marina 
The marina currently contains 105 wet slips, although that number can vary somewhat depending on 
the size (width) of the occupying vessels. Each designated slip is supplied with its own electrical outlet 
and fresh water supply, as well as access to a refueling line. The individual slip sizes can vary based on 
boater needs, but they can accommodate a variety of vessels, typically within the range from 30 to 79 
linear feet for the standard slips, and 79 to 110 linear feet for the T-head slips. In addition, some slips 
have an attached finger for easier access, which is considered more desirable. 
Generally the jetties and slips are constructed of PVC pilings bored and filled with concrete and steel; 
and wood plank surfacing. Many of the smaller slips are horizontally separated by wooden columns 
used to tie up vessels rather than there being jetties between each slip. 
The physical docks were constructed over several years, from 1991-1995, and are considered to be in 
average condition. Ongoing renovations have been made to the docks throughout the years, with 
upcoming expenditures included a complete resurfacing as well as re-facing the wooden skirts on 
most concrete pilings. The docks consist of mostly concrete pilings and cross braces with some wood, 
along with wooden skirts and wood decking surface. There have been no major renovations to slip 
structure within the past five years. 
The subject marina benefits greatly from its location in Vessup Bay, which is well protected and 
positioned in a convenient area at the heart of Red Hook. In addition, this bay has a direct route to St. 
John and the British Virgin Islands and has a depth that will accommodate vessels with a maximum 
draft of 10 feet and a maximum vessel length of 110 feet. The subject is one of the closest commercial 
marinas to both St. John and the BVI, and this convenient location is a major demand generator for 
commercial charters as well as vessels based in St. John and the BVI which are often in need of a 
fueling station. The quality and condition of the docks is considered to be average; however, the 
services and amenities offered at this marina are considered to be above average.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014386.txt,"estimates imply RF would generate ROTEs of 10-11% in 2016-2017E, hence we find RF
fairly valued at 1.3x TBV. Our 13x multiple is in-line with large regional peers. Our DCF
assumes a two-stage cost of capital of 13.6% and 10.5% and a terminal growth rate of
6.5% and Tier 1 common of 8% at termination.

Downside risks to our PO are a slower-than-expected credit recovery, and the Fed on
hold for a longer period of time.

Signature Bank (SBNY)

We use an equal-weighted three-factor valuation framework (P/E, P/TBV, DCF) to arrive
at our $160 PO and assign a 2.1x multiple to 3Q17E TBV, representing a premium to the
group, which we believe is appropriate given a stronger profitability and capital profile,
and above-peer-growth prospects. Our 16.1x multiple on 2017E is higher than peers
given consistent above peer growth. Our DCF assumes a two-stage cost of capital of
10% and a terminal growth rate of 4%.

Risks to our price objective are required provisioning at higher-than-forecast levels,
further deterioration in rental income for commercial properties, and a longer-than-
anticipated low-rate environment.

SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI)

We use a three-factor valuation framework (P/E, P/TBV, DCF} to arrive at our $53 PO,
assigning a 1.7x multiple to 2017E TBV and 14.5x multiple on 17E EPS. Above peer
P/TBV due to their above median profitability, and below peer P/E due to their below
median EPS growth. We have weighted the P/E and P/TBV factors equally at 40%, and
our DCF analysis by 20%.

Our DCF assumes a two-stage cost of capital of 12% and a terminal growth rate of 4%.

Risks to our price objective are macro risks, such as a slower than expected rate
increase. Upside risks are higher-than-expected capital return, a general beta rally for
bank stocks, and faster recognition of “normalized” earnings.

SVB Financial Group (SIVB)

We use a three-factor valuation framework (P/TBV, P/E, DCF) to arrive at our $165 price
objective and assign a 1.8x multiple to our 2Q17E TBV and apply a 17x P/E to 17E EPS.
Our valuation multiples are both in line with high growth peers due to SIVB's high
profitability and EPS growth profile. Our DCF assumes a two-stage cost of capital of
9.5% and a terminal growth rate of 6%.

Downside risks are a longer than expected low rate environment and a slowdown in the
technology sector and related IPO activity. Upside risks are sooner than expected rate
hike, or better than expected pickup in the tech sector.

Synovus Financial Corp. (SNV)

We use a three-factor valuation framework (P/E, P/TBV, DCF) to arrive at our $40 price
objective and assign a 1.7x multiple to our forward 2Q17 TBV, given peers are currently
trading higher and a discount is warranted given their lower return profile. We place a
15x multiple on 2017E EPS, in line with the historical median for the stock. Our DCF
assumes a two-stage cost of capital of 9%, and a terminal growth rate of 3%.

Downside risks to our price objective are potentially slower-than-expected economic
growth in their footprint or a potential takeout price that is lower than where the stock
is trading today. Upside risks to our price objective are a quicker pick-up in capital return
than we are expecting and SNV being acquired above our price objective.

by maintenance recovery, on top of depreciation recovery, would have to hold the
same ratio in order for pay to cover both. Experience shows this as unlikely in any
case, let alone all cases. The boss and her secretary probably couldn’t hold

maintenance consumption to that ratio if they tried.

Another strong argument against the hypothesis of prior claims on pay is lack of a
source. The claimant would be whoever other than the worker had paid for the
maintenance consumption and needed to be made whole. Thus the employing firm
would hold a valid claim if it had provided the maintenance consumption in order to
enable the work. That would put the firm in the position of a farmer who must feed
the livestock and must earn enough profit to recoup the cost. We went through this
in the parable of Phil and Bill. But the employer firm does not advance the cost
because it has no motive to do so. It knows that the worker will pay it anyhow if
means allow. Where means don’t allow, as in retirement without adequate savings,
the worker looks to transfer payments from society generally rather than from the

firm alone.

Now comes the evidence of age-wage profiles. This evidence is the substance behind
the parable of the boss and her secretary. The evidence is apt. Wage generally
means hourly pay, while “earnings” means yearly pay. Wage-earnings profiles show
arise with age, but peaking and reversing as workers reach their fifties or so. The
reason is that they tend to work fewer hours. I consider pay per hour a better
measure of human capital than pay per year. If someone is worth $30 per hour half
time, my impression is that she would be worth $30 per hour full time. If she prefers
to stay home, her leisure must give her that much psychic pay instead. Psychic pay

cuts just as much ice with me.

My boss and secretary were cases preferring to work full time. Age-wage profiles
bear out the scenario | imagined for them. They illustrate the logical certainty that

human depreciation is expected to be recovered in pay, and support the

Appelbaum was also well connected in this culture. He was the North American representative
for Wikileaks before he moved to Berlin in 2013. He also managed Wikileaks’ cyber security
when it released classified documents in Iceland in 2010. He was so well-regarded among
hacktavists that Assange chose him as his keynote speaker replacement at the “Hackers of the
Planet Earth” (HOPE) convention in New York City. Assange also sung his praises, telling
Rolling Stone “Jake [Appelbaum] has been a tireless promoter behind the scenes of our cause.”
For its part, Ro//ing Stone entitled its profile of Appelbaum, “Meet the most dangerous man on
the Internet.” The reason that Assange needed a replacement for this particular event was that he
feared he would be arrested if he came to New York because he had released the Manning files on
Wikileaks.

In Berlin, Appelbaum went to extreme lengths to protect himself from American surveillance.
For example, when George Packer interviewed him for the New Yorker, in 2014, he insisted on
meeting with Packer naked in a sauna so he could be sure Packer did not have a recording device
(other than his notebook.) Appelbaum stated repeatedly in other interviews that he was being
spied upon by America. While his claims may have sounded paranoid to his interviewers, as a
character in Joseph Heller’s Catch 22 famously said, “Just because you are paranoid doesn’t mean
that you are not being followed.” In any event, Appelbaum acted to defeat the perceived
surveillance.

Runa Sandvik was another principal core developers in the TOR project in 2012. A Norwegian
national in her mid-twenties, she wrote in 2012 a well-followed blog for Forbes on Internet
privacy in which she identified herself as a privacy and security researcher working at the
intersection of technology, law and policy. As a close associate of Appelbaum’s, she worked
tirelessly to extend TOR’s cloak of anonymity against the surveillance of the NSA and other
would-be intruders of privacy. Appelbaum and Sandvik shared another distinction. They both
came in contact with Snowden before he went public and while he was still working for the NSA
in Hawaii.

Snowden was in 2012 a major advocate of TOR software. He made no secret of his concerns
about it electronic interceptions. He even wore to work a jacket with a parody of the NSA
insignia, which, instead of merely depicting the NSA eagle, show the eagle clutching AT&T
phone lines. He had also become a member of the Electronic Freedom Foundation, the digital
rights organization that was helping finance TOR. His efforts on behalf of TOR were not limited
to symbolic gestures. Through his work as a system administrator for Dell, he had found
documents revealing NSA efforts to defeat TOR’s ability to camouflage its user’s identity on the
Internet. Though not yet successful, he found that the NSA was attempting to build back-door
entry ways into TOR software. He also knew that the NSA was becoming increasingly hostile
to the spread of TOR software. One of the NSA documents that he illicitly downloaded was
entitled “TOR Stinks.” It described the NSA’s enormous but not fully successful efforts to
penetrate TOR servers. In addition, he downloaded NSA documents describing programs begun
in 2012 that aimed at searching the Internet for the cyber-signatures of foreign parties suspected
of hacking into US government systems. So he knew that the NSA considered the TOR
movement an enemy.

How do we teach prediction when there is no script and there are
no seemingly relevant prior cases? In some sense we can’t. We can teach
people how to go about trying to make predictions. This is actually what
science is about. Scientists create theories that make predictions, which
they then try to verify with evidence. This process—hypotheses verified
by evidence—can be taught in the sense that it is a way of thinking that
can be practiced in various venues. It is reasonable to start teaching chil-
dren to think in this way about the world around them. As for adults,
teaching scientific reasoning in the context of corporate training is
probably a less than optimal place to start. People in corporations need
to be able to reason from evidence and to understand what data would
confirm or deny the value of actions they have taken for the benefit of
the company. This, of course, is scientific reasoning. But, unfortunately,
the people who go into the business world tend to have never practiced
scientific reasoning in their educational careers because they weren’t
interested in science. But they must be interested in predicting well in
order to succeed in business.

HOW TO TEACH MODELING

Building a model of a process is very difficult for a child to do and not
so easy for an adult to do either. When you teach computer science,
you learn this quickly enough. Computer programs are models of pro-
cesses. People try to write computer programs by creating diagrams
that model what happens first and then what happens next, and so
on. These models are almost never right the first time.

Programmers learn to debug their programs, which means they
continue to try to get their model to be accurate. But most people
cannot do this very easily, and it is a very important skill. Knowing
how to raise money is important if one wants to start a business, for
example. The money-raising process can be understood, but one has
to examine it and go through it.

This is just as true of ordering in a restaurant. Children may seem
to know about ordering in a restaurant, but they may not understand
money or service or having a job exactly and thus may have an er-
roneous model of the process. Why does the waitress bring food, is a
complex question for a 5-year-old, but also an important one. Build-
ing models of how and why things work as they do, is significant for
children to learn to do.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011720.txt,"When I got back, we immediately met with Rabin and agreed on the need to
launch a formal investigation. Rabin then asked me to brief the “editors club”, a
group of about 15 media figures that operated on a gentleman’s agreement that
there would be no publicity or leaks. He believed we should not make public the
fact that I and other generals were there when the accident occurred. At this
stage, we still hoped to hide the purpose of the exercise if possible, something
Rabin knew would be harder if it was known the top military leadership had
observed the exercise. When I briefed the editors’ club, I did tell them in
confidence that I’d been there. Though not specifying the reason for the
exercise, I told them it was for a major operation. The time-honored
understanding was that this information would go no further. But it did,
presumably at first because of leaks by Israeli journalists, then in a series of
detailed reports in the foreign press. Even more frustrating on a personal level,
some of the Israeli reports insinuated that far from giving the editors the full
story of who had been at the Negev exercise, that I’d tried to hide my presence
in order to protect my reputation or shirk responsibility.

Two official inquiries followed: the one we’d agreed with Rabin and a
standard army legal investigation. They found the cause of the tragedy to be a
mix of fatigue after some of the soldiers had spent nearly 48 hours awake,
pressure, confusion and negligence. Astonishingly, it turned out the codeword
for the mock-firing of the missiles in the first stage of the exercise was the same
as for the live missiles. Formal charges were brought against two Sayeret
Matkal officers, and reprimands issued to Amiram Levin and Uri Saguy. I was
also subject to criticism because, due to the unique complexity of the plan, I’d
put Amiram and senior officers within Sayeret Matkal in charge of different
aspects of the preparations. This was viewed as possibly reducing the clarity
over who was ultimately responsible for each aspect of the planning. Neither I,
nor of course Rabin, had played a direct role in what went wrong in the exercise
itself. To the extent I’d been involved, it was to make sure the medical teams
were helicoptered in, and that the injured soldiers were cared for and evacuated
as soon as possible. But politically, the tragedy at Tze’elim would dramatically
resurface for both me and Rabin several years later — after I’d left the military
and was on the verge of joining his government.

I was getting to know Yitzhak much better. The Defense Minister’s office in
the kirva was just down the hall from mine. Almost without fail on Friday
afternoons, he’d ask me in to chat before going home. We would sit around a
low table in the corner of the room, each of us sipping coffee, or sometimes
beer, and Rabin invariably puffing on a cigarette. He never raised questions of

ready to sit beside the German unified state without some friends.

So the eurozone was flawed from the outset, a structure awaiting internal assault: The
problem is we have a single currency without a political union and without a fiscal union.

The second blunder was the 1990s expansion of NATO to the Russian border. For
Keating, this was recklessness for which the world may yet pay.

Sensible policy would have included a place for Russia in the new world order, he says.
But that didn't happen. So Russian liberals were pushed to one side by Russian
nationalists. In a sense the US has created Vladimir Putin.

Who is responsible? He points the finger at Bill Clinton.

On the 2008 financial crisis, he says former US Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan
must bear a fair amount of responsibility”.

“Greenspan is someone | know and like, Keating says. But if you are so naive to believe
that institutions with a balance sheet with assets geared at 45 to one is not an accident
waiting to happen then you don't deserve to be chairman of the Federal Reserve.

He praises Obama for seeking a return to the liberal internationalism that, in Keating's
view, made the US great in the post-World War Il age. This is the US he loves but it is still
in retreat.

Asked about the nature of leadership, Keating reveals what lies within his heart: | believe
there is a poetic strand to life that doesn't exist in an economics textbook.

“This is not to say that rationalism isn't important and good. It is. But left to itself without
the guidance of higher meaning and a higher concept, rationalism can be mean and
incomplete. | say if you simply live on rational policy and briefing notes you are not
sufficiently informed.

You need a higher calling or some inner system of belief - here | mention Kant and the
inner command that tells you what is true, what is right, what is good. The inner
command must be the divining construct in what you do.

Music has always been a large part of what makes me tick. You listen to a great work. .
. you hear the majesty of these works and your head and soul gets caught up in them.
When that happens you are in for bigger things and you will strike out to be better.

When | was listening to music | would always have the pad out to write the ideas down.

and that the initial withdrawals and redeployments went ahead smoothly. And
they did. But I also was soon playing a part in a renewed effort by Rabin to use
the momentum of Oslo to achieve peace agreements with our other Arab
neighbors: the Syrians, although he knew that would be tough, and first the
Jordanians. I would always have had some role, by virtue of the need for a chief
of staff to weigh in on security issues. But as Yitzhak had done from the start,
he involved me and others in his inner political circle in wider discussions on
the whole range of negotiating issues. Especially after Oslo, he seemed
determined to keep Peres’s role to an absolute minimum.

No peace talks are ever completely straightforward, but the process with
Jordan was very close to that. The main issues on the Jordanian side involved
ensuring a proper share of scarce water supplies; and dealing with Israel’s de
facto control of a fairly large area near the southern end of our border. A
number of kibbutzim and moshavim were farming the land there. But under the
post-1948 armistice, it had been allocated to Jordan. Israel’s priorities were to
put in place a fully open relationship of peace and cooperation, and to get
assurances Jordan would not allow its territory to be used by Palestinian groups
to launch terror attacks.

I was struck by how much more easily compromises can be found if you
truly trust the party on the other side. From my earlier meeting with Hussein in
England, before the Gulf War, I’d been impressed by the king’s thoughtful and
measured, yet warm and open, demeanor. That, in itself, inspired trust. But ever
since 1967, even in times of high tension, Israel and Jordan had kept open secret
lines of communication, and both sides had generally demonstrated a shared
desire, and ability, to steer clear of conflict. The main trade-off in the search for
a formal peace turned out to be not too difficult. We agreed to ensure water
provision, and to accept Jordanian sovereignty over the 1949 armistice area, in
return for which the king allowed the Israelis who had been working the land to
stay in place as lessees. On the final Wednesday of October 1994, near our
border crossing in the Arava desert, I watched as Rabin, King Hussein, and
President Clinton formally seal the full “Treaty of Peace Between the State of
Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.”

BREYER, J., dissenting

as it appeared more than 75 years ago in Sutherland’s
book on statutory construction, says that “when a statute
refers to a general subject, the statute adopts the law on
that subject as it exists whenever a question under the
statute arises.” Ante, at 9 (citing 2 J. Sutherland, Statu-
tory Construction §§5207-5208 (8d ed. 19438); emphasis
added).

But a canon is at most a rule of thumb. Indeed, Suther-
land himself says that “[n]o single canon of interpretation
can purport to give a certain and unerring answer.” 2
Sutherland, supra, §4501, p. 316. And hornbooks, sum-
marizing case law, have long explained that whether a
reference statute adopts the law as it stands on the date of
enactment or includes subsequent changes in the law to
which it refers is “fundamentally a question of legislative
intent and purpose.” Fox, Effect of Modification or Repeal
of Constitutional or Statutory Provision Adopted by Refer-
ence in Another Provision, 168 A. L. R. 627, 628 (1947);
see also 82 C.J.S., Statutes §485, p. 687 (2009) (“The
question of whether a statute which has adopted another
statute by reference will be affected by amendments made
to the adopted statute is one of legislative intent and
purpose”); id., at 688 (statute that refers generally to
another body of law will ordinarily include subsequent
changes in the adopted law only “as far as the changes are
consistent with the purpose of the adopting statute’).

Thus, all interpretive roads here lead us to the same
place, namely, to context, to history, to purpose, and to
consequences. Language alone cannot resolve the stat-
ute’s linguistic ambiguity.

Building Boom in Gaza’s Ruins Belies

Misery That Remains

Ethan Bronner

June 25, 2011 -- GAZA — Two luxury hotels are opening in Gaza
this month. Thousands of new cars are plying the roads. A second
shopping mall — with escalators imported from Israel — will open
next month. Hundreds of homes and two dozen schools are about to
go up. A Hamas-run farm where Jewish settlements once stood is
producing enough fruit that Israeli imports are tapering off.

As pro-Palestinian activists prepare to set sail aboard a flotilla aimed
at maintaining an international spotlight on Gaza and pressure on
Israel, this isolated Palestinian coastal enclave is experiencing its first
real period of economic growth since the siege they are protesting
began in 2007.

“Things are better than a year ago,” said Jamal El-Khoudary,
chairman of the board of the Islamic University, who has led Gaza’s
Popular Committee Against the Siege. “The siege on goods is now 60
to 70 percent over.”

Ala al-Rafati, the economy minister for Hamas, the militant group
that governs Gaza, said in an interview that nearly 1,000 factories are
operating here, and he estimated unemployment at no more than 25
percent after a sharp drop in jobless levels in the first quarter of this
year. “Yesterday alone, the Gaza municipality launched 12 projects
for paving roads, digging wells and making gardens,” he said.

So is that the news from Gaza in mid-2011? Yes, but so is this:
Thousands of homes that were destroyed in the Israeli antirocket
invasion two and a half years ago have not been rebuilt. Hospitals

a hero is and what leadership is, and they can determine for them-
selves who they know or have seen who is good at both. Again, real
experiences and discussions are how one learns to think about this,
but it must be done in an environment of possible truths, not prede-
termined truths. One doesn’t create a nation of people who can think
by telling them what they should think. Kids know who is the leader
among them. They should learn to discuss what it is about their leader
that makes them want to follow. This is difficult discussion to have
with a 6-year-old, but it gets easier with age.

Once again, asking kids to make judgments isn’t that unusual.
Here is a remark from a parenting book that I happened upon:

When adults praise their kids for smart judgments, the kids glow.
But here’s the clincher: kids earn more and more freedom and
independence when parents trust their judgments more and
more.®

The issue here is, yet again, not whether kids make judgments, but
whether they are taught, as a central part of what they study, how to
make judgments.

The cognitive processes depend on reasoning from evidence in a
way that makes sense. This is not something people are naturally good
at. They often exhibit faulty reasoning. Practicing reasoning means
practicing within particular domains of knowledge. Reasoning is the
same process no matter what you are reasoning about, but we don’t
reason about nothing. Learning the actual facts is important, but it
is the idea that this is important that has sent the school systems on
the wrong path. Academics study the facts, as well they should, but
they also teach the facts, which is a grievous error. How to determine
the facts and how to determine their effects on a situation is what the
processes of diagnosis, planning, and causation are all about.

HOW TO TEACH INFLUENCE

This is yet another childhood skill. Children learn how to influence
their parents and their siblings and their friends very early on. Of
course, they may not learn these things in a good way. They might
learn that temper tantrums or bullying works very well.

Quantifying the (bond-equity correlation) risks to risk parity
Last week’s sharp sell-off in JGBs renewed concerns of forced selling by risk parity
funds. While the drawdowns in US Treasuries, US equities, and ultimately risk parity
portfolios were small and short-lived, the latent risk remains worth monitoring, as (i)
leverage is still near max levels across a variety of risk parity parametrizations, (ii) bond
allocations are historically elevated, and (iii) markets continue to be sceptical of a 2016
Fed hike. Hence we provide a simple scenario tool to help investors assess what relative
moves in bonds and equities could catalyse significant deleveraging by rules-based risk
parity funds running vol target overlays. For example, a -2% daily decline in the S&P
500 coupled with a -0.6% fall in 10y Treasury prices (poor diversification) could trigger a
25% deleveraging (of unlevered notional) today, whereas a -4% SPX drop and +1% bond
rally (good diversification) would generate no selling pressure, underscoring the critical
role played by bond-equity correlation in governing the severity of risk parity unwinds.
Europe
Buy the seasonal oil dip via bullish X-market risk reversals
Selling rich USO (WTI tracker) 3M 25d puts to fund cheaper SXEP (European Oil & Gas
equity) calls is historically attractive. Indeed the number (>2) of long SXEP calls per short
USO put is in the 90 th %-ile since 2008. The trade leverages both our commodity
strategists’ ‘buy the dip’ view and our equity strategists’ bullish outlook on the Oil & Gas
sector, which has been the worst performing over the last 1M. Moreover, the average
payoff of being long SXEP 3M 25d calls would have been >2x greater than USO 3M 25d
calls (owing to more frequent positive returns), when sized for the same upfront cost.
Asia
Own NKY Sep/Oct calendar call at vol hit YTD low level going into the Sep BOJ
Post the Jul-16 BoJ and the announcement of a ¥28.1tn fiscal stimulus package, NKY and
USDJPY 1M vols have dropped to near YTD low levels, both USDJPY and NKY 2M-1M
term structures are historically steep, pricing in a slow summer. Our strategists believe
Sep-16 BoJ’s will likely create uncertainty, however, NKY Sep-Oct ATM fwd vol currently
trades at the low end of its trading range going into BoJ’s YTD. Plus, our analysis
suggests a further squeeze in yield will likely be positive for the NKY. We recommend
buying 1x NKY Oct 17500 call vs. selling 0.65x Sep 17250 call.
Trade update: Closing the NKY Aug/Sep put calendar trade at 0.28% premium
Korean auto-callable issuance slightly rose while NKY Uridashi issuance fell in July

BofAML GFSI TM X-Asset Risk Landscape
GFSI makes new YTD lows as BoE & NFP boost risk assets
The GFSI declined to a new YTD low of 0.18 as of 5-Aug, a level not seen since Nov-15.
With the BoE surprising to the upside in terms of cutting rates, re-starting QE and
guiding towards more accommodative policy down the line, as well as better than
expected US non-farm payrolls, risk assets globally got a boost.
• Credit experienced the biggest decline in stress across assets: Chart 3
shows that credit (followed by equities) experienced the biggest weekly stress
decline. Indeed, Chart 5 and Chart 6 show that sovereign risk as measured by IG
& sub-IG foreign sovereign bond spreads experienced the most significant
weekly declines in stress versus their history in the GFSI.
• Europe continues to be most stressed region: Chart 4 shows that Europe is
the most stressed region in the GFSI, despite the stress declines last week. USrelated
stresses which were already relatively lower vs the other regions, were
more resilient. Indeed the only significant move higher in regional stress was in
USD Libor-OIS spreads (Chart 5), which our Rates strategists view as driven by
the anticipation of US money market mutual fund reform in October.

The GFSI Risk Allocator favours being underweight risk assets given the distribution of
stresses within the GFSI. The percentages of Bullish, Bearish and Neutral GFSI
components (as used in the Risk Allocator) were 8.7%, 13.0% & 78.3%, respectively as
of 5-Aug. The Risk Allocator (using Bull, Bear & Neutral weights of 2, 0, 1) suggests
reducing the underweight position to 4.3% UW from last week’s 17.4% UW.

Volatility in the US
Quantifying the (bond-equity correl) risks to risk parity
Last week’s sharp sell-off in JGBs (Chart 7) following the BoJ’s decision not to cut rates
renewed investor fears of forced selling by risk parity funds. However, the spill-over
into US Treasuries was relatively muted (Chart 7), and coupled with a small and fleeting
drawdown in US equities, risk parity portfolio volatility failed to rise materially (Chart 8).
Consequently, risk parity funds were likely forced to unwind little to none of their
leverage last week and remain near max leverage levels (Chart 9).
For this very reason, the latent risk in this corner of the quant fund space remains worth
monitoring. Furthermore, as we noted post-Brexit, fixed income allocations within risk
parity funds are historically elevated today. And with federal-funds futures markets
implying a ~25% chance of a Sep rate hike and less than a 50% probability of a Dec
hike, bond markets may be surprised by a 2016 Fed hike.

Monitoring relative equity/bond moves for potential risk parity deleveraging
It is intuitive to think that rising volatility corresponds to an increase in model-driven
selling pressure from risk parity strategies. However, what’s less appreciated in our
view is the impact on risk parity allocations as a result of the relative dynamics
between component volatilities and correlation. For example, through the close on the
Monday post-Brexit (27-Jun-16), S&P 500 volatility rose from 9.6% two days prior to
17.9% (increase of 1.9x) while 10-Year US Treasury Futures return volatility rose 4.3%
to 6.6% (increase of 1.5x). Despite these outsized vol moves, in a recent report we
showed that owing to the diversification (increasingly negative correlation) between
equities and bonds, unlevered risk parity portfolio volatility remained stable and hence,
target vol overlays were less likely to be subject to model-driven selling.
Given low levels of realized volatility across asset classes, it’s also intuitive to expect
continued elevated levels of leverage in risk parity products. To the extent that the
leverage is via vol control overlays, there are reasonable concerns on the potential
market impact should these model-driven investments be forced to simultaneously
deleverage. To that end, we provide a simple scenario tool (Chart 10) to help investors
assess what relative moves in the S&P 500 and 10-year US Treasury futures could
catalyze significant deleveraging by rules-based, vol-controlled risk parity funds.
4 Global Equity Volatility Insights | 09 August 2016
Importantly, this scenario tool is a function of (1) current unlevered risk parity volatility,
(2) current risk parity component weights, and (3) the maximum leverage of the target
volatility overlay. For simplicity, we used only a two asset risk parity portfolio of equity
and fixed income applied to the S&P 500 and 10-Year US Treasury Futures.

Source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research. Data as of 5-Aug-16. Equity and fixed income components within the theoretical risk parity
investment are represented by S&P 500 total return and 10-Year US Treasury Futures total return. Risk parity allocations are determined
monthly and rebalanced using prior 12-month realized volatility. Unlevered portfolio volatility for determining target volatility leverage
measured using EWMA with lambda equal to 0.94.
For example, last Friday 10-Year US Treasury futures declined about 60bps. Had the
S&P 500 declined 2.0%, we would have expected about 25% of the unlevered notional
of a model 8% vol-targeted, 2.0x max leverage risk parity portfolio to deleverage. The
S&P 500 was in fact up 86bps on a total return basis which according to the tool falls in
the region of no deleveraging.
Also, to put recent events in perspective, we plotted on the scenario tool the respective
moves in the S&P 500 and 10-Year US Treasury futures during the Taper Tantrum (19-
Jun-2013), the Aug-15 risk flare (24-Aug-15), and post-Brexit (24-Jun-2016). Note, for
an accurate assessment through those events, we would also need to reconfigure the
scenario tool for the respective unlevered risk parity volatility and risk parity component
weights on those dates. However, with current measures for both, the tool does
estimate current deleveraging flows should we see similar equity and bond moves today.
Interestingly, equity/bond moves through the Aug-15 risk flare would not cause a
deleveraging today. The reason is bonds have increased in allocation since last August
(78% vs. 66%), and hence the portfolio is more resilient towards equity market declines
(but consequently also more sensitive to fixed income declines).
The scenario tool also underscores impact on risk parity leverage as a result of the
relative dynamics between component volatility and correlation. For example, the first
and third quadrants (upper right and lower left sections) are dominated by scenarios of
greater than 50% deleveraging. On the other hand, the second and fourth quadrants
Global Equity Volatility Insights | 09 August 2016 5
have episodes of more benign model-driven deleveraging. In each quadrant exists
examples of simultaneously increasing equity and bond volatility (that is, high absolute
equity and bond daily returns). However, in the first and third quadrant, equity and bond
moves are in the same direction, which would likely be an example of increasing
correlation. On the other hand, in the second and fourth quadrant equity and bond
moves are in opposite directions and hence correlation is subject to a decrease. The
main takeaway here is the most risk of model driven deleveraging from vol controlled
risk parity funds comes when both volatility and correlation of the underlying
components rise together.

Week in review & notable trends (US)
US equities at new all-time highs on upbeat employment report
Both the S&P500 and NASDAQ finished the week higher marking fresh all-time highs as
the July nonfarm payrolls and average hourly earnings came in better-than-expected. As
a result, VIX fell to its lowest levels since Jul-14 and the SPX 1y vs. 1m ATMf implied vol
spread rose to its highest level in almost four years on lower short dated vol.
Across other asset classes, the USD finished with gains against other major currencies,
while Treasury yields rose across the curve, which partly explained the outperformance
(underperformance) in Financials (Utilities) (i.e., +1.7% and -2.7%, respectively).
Most companies (86% as of 5-Aug) in the SPX have reported Q2 results and the blended
(actual + estimated) yoy earnings decline for Q2-2016 now stands at -3.5%, less than
the expected decline of -5.5% as of 30-Jun. Analysts expect CY16 earnings decline of -
0.3% which would mark the first time SPX has reported two consecutive years of
earnings decline since 2008. Earnings growth is now expected to resume in Q4-16.

With SPX rallying on a stronger-than-expected July jobs report,
SPX implied vol took a further leg down, especially in the
shorter end of the vol curve. Indeed, SPX 1m ATMf implied vol
ended the week at 9.1 vol pts, within striking distance of its 2-
year lows.
On the other hand, longer dated ATMf implied vols did not fall
nearly as much causing a material steepening in the vol term
structure. For instance, the 1yr-1m implied vol spread reached
its highest level since 27-Sep-12 (6.4 vol pts).

Since its peak in Jul-15, the Biotech sector (NBI Index) has been
on one of its worst runs in decades, underperforming the broad
market benchmark (SPX) by a whopping ~30% on a total return
basis. However, more recently the sector has regained some
lost ground on solid large-cap earnings reports (i.e., +13.2%
since 1-Jul, 9.3% above the SPX).
While short-dated implied vol has dropped considerably as a
consequence of the recent rally, it still remains supported on a
5-yr basis. Also, upside vol has been richening vs. ATM vol, with
the 1m IBB ATM-110 implied vol spread reaching its lowest
level in five years on 4-Aug and finishing the week at 1.2 vol pts
(3 rd 5-yr %-ile).
Investors with a constructive view on the sector who are
concerned about a reversal of the recent gains should consider
replacing or initiating long position via short dated ATM calls
partially financed by expensive OTM calls.

convention used in variance swaps. Term-structure adjustment = we add the median level of the daycount
adjusted generic 1m/2m/3m fly (i.e. -0.5x Sep fut. +1xOct fut. -0.5x Nov fut.) to take into
account the usual VIX term structure.
Using the VIX term structure in the Sep/Oct/Nov buckets and
adjusting for term structure/day convention (see footnote to
Chart 13), we estimate the option markets’ implied move over a
single day in the Oct-Nov period (which encompasses the US
election on 8-Nov).
Our estimated implied move is 1.4% which is notably very close
to the typical 1-day post-election day SPX realized move over
past election cycles (1.5% since 1928) (see Chart 14).
Importantly, there is a larger-than-typical variation in the
distribution of all daily post-election SPX returns (34.0 vol pts
vs. 18.4 vol pts for daily SPX returns since Jan-1928), with the
largest and the fourth largest daily post-election SPX returns
since 1928 occurring in the last two election cycles alone (see
Chart 14).

Hence, investors who believe this is not your typical election (to
quote President Obama at the latest Democratic National
Convention) may still find that option markets are currently
pricing too little of a move.
However, as we have recently argued the debate about whether
a Trump win would be good or bad for markets coupled with the
inability to exactly pinpoint real risks are likely headwinds to a
sizeable market shock.

Volatility in Europe
Buy the seasonal oil dip via bullish X-market risk reversals
Levered X-market risk reversal: Sell 1x USO 3M 25d (~88% strike) puts
to fully fund 2.1x SXEP (Oil & Gas equity) 25d (~106% strike) calls (indic.)
Alternative (unlevered) implementation: Sell USO 25d puts to fund fully
fund closer to the money SXEP calls
The seasonal sell-off in oil presents a ‘buy the dip’ opportunity according to our
commodity strategists, who expect prices to rebound to $55/bbl by year end. In fact
current levels of ~$40 are close to the summer floor ($39) they had previously
suggested.
BofAML strategists have turned bullish Oil & Gas equities given more CB (BoE)
easing, attractive div yields and exposure to the EM recovery narrative. Moreover, Oil &
Gas has been the worst performing Stoxx 600 sector over the last 1M, suggesting it has
ample scope to rally if it is to catch up to the broader equity market (Chart 15).
USO (Oil ETF) puts are rich vs. SXEP (European Oil & Gas equity) calls: The number
of long SXEP 25d calls that can be fully funded by selling 1 short USO 25d put is near
historical highs (90 th percentile since ’08, Chart 16). In contrast, both SXEP and USO risk
reversals are only modestly more attractive than their historical medians.
SXEP calls would have offered better value than USO calls at current levels in terms
of average historical payoffs as well as the frequency of positive returns (when sized for
the same upfront cost, Chart 17). Note that an unlevered implementation of the trade
allows for early participation in any potential SXEP rally (as the SXEP call strike is near
the money) while providing a ~12% buffer before incurring losses (at expiry) on the
short USO leg (Chart 18).
CSPP has purchased an outsized proportion of Energy corporate bonds and this has
yet to feed through to equities according to our credit strategists (Chart 19): The
number of Energy corporate bonds bought by the ECB is approx. 45% of the total
eligible amount – the 3 rd highest proportion across all European sectors.
Potential USO losses may be dampened if the recent $/Oil correlation persists:
Since mid-2015 oil drawdowns have largely coincided with USD weakening (Chart 20).

Global Equity Volatility Insights | 09 August 2016 11
Week in review (Europe)
The FTSE100 reached 13 months highs last week as the BOE exceeded market
expectations by announcing a 25 bp rate cut (its first rate cut in 7yrs), a further £60bn
of QE purchases (vs forecasted £50 bn) while also hinting at more potential stimulus in
the autumn. Unsurprisingly, GBPUSD fell further on the back of this. The better-thanexpected
US nonfarm payrolls that beat all surveyed forecasts helped drive US markets
to new all-time closing highs also helped European equities rebound from a mid-week
trough. As a result, the V2X has retraced close to its 11 month lows as foreseeable
catalysts are behind us for a potentially quieter end to the summer.
• Long dated ESTX50 var term structure is historically elevated; vol term
structure is not: The dislocation of 3y var convexity (var strike/ATMf volatility)
vs that of 1y, which in itself is near extremes, is particularly striking
• European issuance of ESTX50-linked structured products picked up in July:
We estimate issuance of ~€120Mn/day in July, which compares to €5Mn daily
issuance in June and €55Mn daily issuance in 1H16 (excluding June).
• The current vega outstanding in SX5E-linked products is €143Mn, which is in
its 97 th percentile since Jan-14 (when our records begin). Moreover, this could
rise to as much as €169Mn if the SX5E rallied to 3280.
Long-dated ESTX50 var term structure is steep; vol term structure is not
Despite a significantly steep longer dated ESTX50 variance term structure (vs its
average since 2008), the volatility term structure is nearly flat. As a result, the level of
ESTX50 long dated variance is historically elevated vs the level of long dated vol. The
dislocation of 3y var convexity (varswap strike/ATMf vol ratio) vs 1y var convexity (which
in itself is near its historic highs) is particularly striking.

Structured product Jul update: EU issuance picked up; Korean issuance lagged
We estimate issuance of ESTX50-linked structured products in Europe was
~€120Mn/day in July, much higher than the €5Mn daily issuance in June and €55Mn daily
issuance in 1H16 (excluding June). This compares to ~€20Mn daily issuance in July out of

the Abe administration has laid out both its new monetary and fiscal policies. In the
short-term, there are few catalysts and both NKY and USDJPY 1Mth implied volatilities
have retraced materially. VNKY is at 21.5 and USDJPY 1M ATM vol is at 9.8%, near their
YTD low levels.
USDJPY 2M-1M term structure at its steepest & NKY’s in its 98 th %-ile since ‘11
FX has been the main driver in the current Macro world. Chart 29 shows that the
USDJPY 2-month minus 1-month term structure is at its highs since 2011. The Sep BOJ
meeting is expected to be held on 21-Sep so USDJPY 1-month options do not cover the
event. Notably, the NKY term structure is also very steep at 1.5%, which is in its 98 th
percentile since 2011. The NKY term structure was at its steep at 2.5% in Dec-13.

short-dated vol also retraced to near YTD low levels

BofAML: BoJ plans for Sep16 'comprehensive assessment' create uncertainty
The BOJ’s decision in keeping “QE” or interest rate unchanged in July highlighted the
BOJ’s limits in expanding JGB purchases and digging deeper into negative interest rate
territory. More importantly, the central bank announced it will conduct a comprehensive
assessment of its policy at its Sep meeting. By giving guidance for the next meeting,
the BoJ has inevitably focused market attention on possible changes to the monetary
policy framework. Significant monetary easing, including helicopter money, cannot be
ruled out, but the more likely scenario is that the BoJ makes current monetary policy,
which is fixed on achieving 2% inflation target in a short period of time, more 'flexible'.
Market expectation for the Sep BOJ in terms of fwd vol is the near its lows YTD
With NKY Sep ATM vol at 17.8% and Oct ATM at 20%, the NKY Sep-Oct ATM forward
vol is at 21.8%, which is at the low end of the trading range going into BOJ events this
year (Chart 30). We think there is value in owning forward vol via calendar options.

A further squeeze in US and Japanese yields is most positive Japan in Asia
The strong US NFP print and the large Japan fiscal plan catalysed a global selloff in
bonds. Chart 31 shows that NKY is the most sensitive Asian market to rising USD & JPY
yield since 2010 with a correlation of 31%.
Buy 1x NKY Oct 17500 call, short 0.65x Sep 17250 call: Gamma neutral, long vol
Given the low market expectation in the BOJ and a potential rally in Japanese equities on
the back of further yield squeeze and rising BOJ expectation next month, we like owning
1x NKY Oct 17500 call vs. selling 0.65x of Sep 17250 call for 0.7% (¥116). The trade will
have a positive 9% delta, 8bps of vega and flat gamma & theta initially.
Indicative pricing (As of 8-Aug-16, Ref: 16650)
Buy 1x NKY Oct 17500 call: 1.13% (¥187) (iv: 19.2, delta: 24%, gamma: 3.8%)
Sell 0.65x NKY Sep 17250 call: 0.66% (¥110) (iv: 16.9, delta: 23%, gamma: 5.9%)
Net: 0.70% (¥116) (delta: +9, vega: 0.08%)

Week in review & notable trends (Asia)
The MSCI Asia-Pac USD Index inched down 48bps in an eventful week in terms of macro
news, with equities gains offset by USD strength. Following the monetary policy
changes announced during the BoJ, the Abe Cabinet approved a fiscal stimulus package
totalling ¥28.1tn last week. However, the Nikkei fell 190bps and the yen advanced
another 32bps over the week. The Korean government submitted a KRW28tn fiscal
package proposal to the Congress, which our economists believe should sustain growth
near term; the KOSPI2 was little changed (adding 35bps). The RBA cut rates by 25bps
as our economists expected, but Australian stocks declined with the ASX 200 dropping
117bps. Elsewhere in Asia, the HSI, HSCEI, TWSE and Nifty rallied 1.2%, 1.9% 1.2% and
0.5%, respectively.
Japanese equity implied volatility dropped to YTD lows
• Last week, most major Asian implied vols edged down as underlying indices rallied;
ASX 200 vol increased slightly despite the rate cut
• NKY vol saw a larger decline, with 3M ATM vol dropping 1.1 vol pts to 21.7% mainly
due to diminished uncertainty as the fiscal package rolled out
• Most Asian skews flattened and term structures steepened, especially the Nikkei
term structure (spread between 1yr and 1M ATM vols), which increased 3.0 vol pts
and turned positive
NKY Uridashi issuance continues to fall as existing ones haven’t knocked-out
Despite the falling NKY and relatively high implied volatility, Japanese Uridashi issuance
has further retraced as most existing products have not knocked-out. In Jul-16, there
was $450mn Uridashi products issued which are NKY linked. We estimate that the peak
of vega profile is around the current spot.

Korean structured product issuance increased to US$1.9bn
in July; KOSPI2-linked products dominated
Korean auto-callable product issuance ticked up last month,
with a total of US$ 1.9bn notional issued, vs. US$ 1.6bn total
issuance in June.
Looking at individual underlyings, KOSPI2-linked products
(currently US$578mn) saw the largest increase. KOSPI2-linked
issuance hence took over SX5E-linked issuance (currently
US$436mn), which was relatively unchanged compared to June.
HSCEI-linked issuance (currently US$ 69mn) further declined
whereas HSI-linked issuance (currently US$ 262mn) increased
again. SPX-linked issuance grew to US$ 281mn.

Options Risk Statement
Potential Risk at Expiry & Options Limited Duration Risk
Unlike owning or shorting a stock, employing any listed options strategy is by definition
governed by a finite duration. The most severe risks associated with general options
trading are total loss of capital invested and delivery/assignment risk, all of which can
occur in a short period.
Investor suitability
The use of standardized options and other related derivatives instruments are
considered unsuitable for many investors. Investors considering such strategies are
encouraged to become familiar with the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized
Options (an OCC authored white paper on options risks). U.S. investors should consult
with a FINRA Registered Options Principal. For detailed information regarding the risks
involved with investing in listed options:

Disclosures
Important Disclosures
FUNDAMENTAL EQUITY OPINION KEY: Opinions include a Volatility Risk Rating, an Investment Rating and an Income Rating. VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential
price fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst’s assessment of a stock’s: (i) absolute total return potential and (ii)
attractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). There are three investment ratings: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total
return of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than
Buy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12
month total return expectation for a stock and the firm’s guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be
referenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst’s view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).
Investment rating Total return expectation (within 12-month period of date of initial rating) Ratings dispersion guidelines for coverage cluster*
Buy ≥ 10% ≤ 70%
Neutral ≥ 0% ≤ 30%
Underperform N/A ≥ 20%
* Ratings dispersions may vary from time to time where BofA Merrill Lynch Research believes it better reflects the investment prospects of stocks in a Coverage Cluster.
INCOME RATINGS, indicators of potential cash dividends, are: 7 - same/higher (dividend considered to be secure), 8 - same/lower (dividend not considered to be secure) and 9 - pays
no cash dividend. Coverage Cluster is comprised of stocks covered by a single analyst or two or more analysts sharing a common industry, sector, region or other classification(s). A stock’s
coverage cluster is included in the most recent BofA Merrill Lynch report referencing the stock.

Stock view: Marketplace growth should improve in 2017

eBay’s 4Q results showed signs of Marketplace improvement, with improving mobile
and C2C trends and a modest pickup in new buyers. Management expects to put
marketing dollars behind this trend to drive Marketplace growth momentum in 2017
(guidance calls for 1 point of acceleration in Marketplace volume in 1Q, with 2 points for
the full year). Expectations have risen since the start of the year, and we think eBay
needs to deliver 1 point acceleration in US GMV growth vs 1Q to maintain confidence in
management’s execution. There is also significant interest in eBay’s first party ad
strategy and potential improvement in transaction take rates (at expense of MS&O
revenues).

The potential structured data impact also remains top of mind for investors as
structured data will provide the backbone for improving customer search and product
experiences. As of 4Q’16, there are 180mn+ structured data pages v. 100mn+ pages at
the end of 3Q’16. More pages are expected in 2017, which will start to be exposed to
core organic traffic. Management appears confident that the impact of structured data
would increasingly benefit results and that structured data formats will be much more
visible by holiday 2017. Overall, if 1Q results are at/above expectations, we think the
stock will reflect even more optimism on structured data improvement.

For margins, we expect continued pressure in 2017 as the company ramps up marketing
spend and increases its Al capabilities. If the company can manage to accelerate top
line growth through conversion rate improvements, some of the upside may be invested,
limiting 2017 earnings flow through (but benefitting growth in 2018). Therefore, we
think customer, transaction and revenue trends most important for 2017, but lack of
margin flow through could be sentiment headwind for the stock.

Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Marketplace growth/outlook

Our model assumes US GMV growth of 3.5% y/y, an 80bps q/q acceleration off an 80ps
easier y/y comp, while we anticipate 6.0% y/y Intl ex-FX GMV growth. US acceleration
(despite a modest Leap Year headwind) is likely needed to maintain increased
management confidence. Our model assumes 8.3% take rate, which is up 10bps y/y and
could be aided by the early transition to 1* party advertising on the site. eBay’s 1Q
revenue guide implies 5% y/y ex-FX growth at the midpoint, while the 2017 revenue
guide calls for 7% ex-FX growth, implying revenue growth acceleration during the year.

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021397.txt,"transcendence and belonging can
simultaneously lead to greater fitness of
the individual and increased cohesion
and sustainability of the social
organization—another indication of
positive selection associated with the
social brain.

The notion of resonance with
another appears repeatedly through the
book. Our connections to others derive
in part from being able to see what they
see, to hear what they hear, to know
what they know, to feel what they feel.
Or we have to be able to believe not only
that this is possible, but that it happens.
The social brain, in which the same
regions are activated by our own
experience of pain and by our perception
of others in pain, makes both aspects
possible. There is a close connection
between being able to “feel for” another
(empathy) and to “see into” another
mind (anthropomorphism).

Language has the potential to
affect people and groups in part because
it is tied to meaning. Language is the
medium through which we convey,
preserve, and transmit meaning from one
individual to another, and from one
social generation to another. Language
is powerful because it can activate
belief, which in turn can activate
physical responses. Words can bind;
words can terrify; and words can cause
physical pain and death. The power of
words comes from the meanings they
entail about our connections to one
another.

Paradox

Our investigation of invisible
forces involving the social brain has led
us repeatedly to factors that
fundamentally conflict. An important
invisible force is the respect we pay to
the boundary between self and other.

151

Page

Our relationship to it comes into play in
conceptualizing loneliness,
anthropomorphism, spirituality, group
behavior, empathy, and inclusive fitness.
When we speak of loneliness, this
boundary seems to be an impenetrable
barrier. When we speak of empathy or
anthropomorphism, however, the self-
other boundary is defined by the
similarity and congruence of individuals
to one another, providing a transparent
window through which we perceive and
interact with others (who must be like
us). And when we speak of group
synchrony, the boundary vanishes
completely: self and other are one.

Successful engagement with
others requires work. It is the work of
attending to something, and it is work
that often is needed to resolve competing
forces. Thinking about other minds is a
demanding task and requires attentional
effort. It is this effort that allows us to
manipulate the transparency of the self-
other boundary by what we put in
through learning, attending, seeking, and
projecting. In effect, we can tune the
degree of resonance we have with
members of different groups. Similarly,
consistent attentional effort is also
required for the physician to attend to
the mindfulness of patients, for the
Vineyard church member to experience
God as present in one’s life, and for
another to find connection to an
omnipresent yet invisible God who
works through the very workings of the
world.

What it means to feel a
connection to a higher being is a theme
that several essays explore. As is
evident in these essays, the Network has
considered very different, even
divergent, pictures of what such
connection might entail. These apparent
inconsistencies that can be found in

On Friday, September 23, 2005 at approximately 1:45 p.m., I began to
copy a tape micro cassette, under case number 05-368 and property
number 05-243, tape number 1. I placed the tape in the telex copy-et,
series 2 machine and began to go through the copying process.
Approximately 1/2 through the tape, the tape wrapped around the
spindle and became locked and stretched the tape. I examined it and
determined that it was in the best interest to leave it as it is as a
prior copy had been made and turned over to Sergeant Frick. I
immediately took the tape to Sergeant Frick and allowed him to examine
it and then obtained the copy from him and Detective Recarey and
brought the copy of the tape down and made a copy for him based on
that. The tape was placed back in the original container and is
retained in the evidence bag under the previously mentioned property
number of 05-243. It is not advisable to attempt to copy this tape as
further damage could result to the recorded material and there is an
existing copy anyway.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011052.txt,"All studies of human capital, as far as I know, effectively treat human depreciation as
deadweight loss. Ben-Porath’s model seems no exception. How does he model pay?
He multiplies human capital by a productivity factor, and then again by the fraction
marketed for pay rather than self-invested. That gives what I call realized work. Pay,
if] am right, measures gross realized work. That is the main amendment I would

propose for his model.

Ben-Porath’s first three equations summarize what I call the growth truism (6.14).

In my terms, not his, he models

human growth = invested consumption + self-invested work
— human depreciation.

He means positive self-invested work in the form of learning. Meanwhile the
inalienability of human capital leaves its depreciation as its only avenue of
decapitalization. Invested consumption corresponds to gross transfer in as meant in
the growth truism (6.14c) while self-invested work is the same as proprietary

output. Then (6.4c) applied to human capital could show as

human growth = invested consumption + positive self-invested work
— human depreciation,
= invested consumption + self-invested work
— recovered human depreciation,

confirming (5.2) and (5.3a).

Logic also seems to agree with Ben-Porath’s interpretation that self- invested work
continues late into careers, and that it must stop when time for recovery runs out.
But I would specify that invested consumption stops, for modeling purposes, at full-

time job entry or a little later to allow for initial job training.

This needn’t follow from my adjusted axioms. It’s just an impression from what | see.
I don’t agree with Schultz that outlays on medicine or worker relocation are

investment. I see them as maintenance consumption preserving skills, not

minute video on encryption (which might have been the same video he used at his Crypto party a
few weeks earlier.)

Greenwald did not manage to encrypt his computer, however. Snowden, unwilling to deal with
Greenwald through an unencrypted channel, broke off contact with him in January 2013. Even
so, he did not give up his plan of using Greenwald in his enterprise. He sought an intermediary
who used encryption.

The alternative route to Greenwald that Snowden chose was Laura Poitras. He knew she had
am association with him. They both were founding board members of the Freedom of the Press
Foundation. Greenwald had also written about her extensively. For example, he wrote an entire
blog about her confrontation with the US government and her plans to make a documentary about
the “U.S. Government’s increasing powers of domestic surveillance [through] its expanding
covert domestic NSA activities”

Since 2011, Poitras had been filming the construction of a massive NSA repository for data in
Bluffdale, Utah. In the anti-surveillance culture, the structure had become symbolic of the powers
of the NSA. In fact, was the same NSA site that Parker Higgins photographed from a blimp in the
fall of 2013 and post on the Internet. Just six months earlier in August 2012, Poitras had
released her documentary about the NSA’s use of the Bluffdale repository for domestic spying,

Aside from her connections with Greenwald, Poitras had other impressive credentials. Born in
1964 in Boston, She came from a wealthy family that donated large sums of money to
philanthropic causes, including $20 million for research on bipolar disorders. After graduating
from the New School for Public Engagement in 1996, she pursued a career as an activist film-
maker. Her focus quickly became exposing NSA’s surveillance. One of her short documentaries
about the NSA’s domestic surveillance program was featured on the New York Times website and
attracted enormous attention in 2012. As a dedicated opponent of the surveillance state, she
participated in public events with William Binney, the now famous ex-NSA whistle-blower, and
Jacob Appelbaum. In April 2012, for example, she made a presentation at the Whitney Museum
in New York with Binney and Appelbaum. She became such a leading activist against the NSA
by December 2012 that Appelbaum, after lauding her work, interspersed clips from her short film
in his keynote address at the Computer Chaos Club convention of hacktavists in Berlin in
December 2012. Snowden also closely followed her rise in this world. By simply googling
Poitras’ name in January 2013, he would have learned about her connections with Greenwald,
Appelbaum, Binney, Assange and other leading figures in the anti-surveillance camp. When asked
later Snowden why he had chosen her to help him, He replied “I didn’t. You chose yourself.” The
problem for Snowden was anonymously drawing her in to his enterprise.

Poitras was living in Berlin in January 2013, which made her vulnerable to NSA surveillance.
To get to her through an encrypted channel, Snowden chose a circuitous approach. On January
11, 2013, he wrote to Micah Lee in Berkeley, California. Unlike Greenwald and Poitras, Lee

Snowden’s whereabouts are clouded—the period between the time
he left the Mira hotel on June 10 and the day he left Hong Kong for
Russia on June 23. When I asked my consulate source whether the
U.S. mission took any action to track Snowden during these thirteen
days, he explained that the FBI had long maintained a contingent
of “legal attachés” based at the consulate to pursue many possible
violations of U.S. law including video piracy. In addition, the CIA
and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) had retained a handful of
“China watchers” under diplomatic cover in Hong Kong. This group
constituted the “intelligence mission,” as he referred to it. It had
developed informal relations with the Hong Kong police that, along
with the NSA’s electronic capabilities abroad, allowed it to track
Snowden’s movements after he had outed himself on the video.
Because Snowden, his lawyers, and the journalists in his entourage
frequently used their cell phones to text one another, it was fairly
easy for the U.S. intelligence mission to follow Snowden’s trail after
he left the Mira hotel. He said that the Hong Kong police also knew
where he was during this period. My source further suggested that
© the massive Chinese intelligence contingent in Hong Kong also ©
knew, because it had close relations with the Hong Kong police.

“So everyone knew Snowden’s whereabouts as he moved every
few days from apartment to apartment,” I interjected. He answered
that it was no secret to anyone except the media and the public. “Of
course we knew,” he said, adding that there were also photographs
of Snowden entering the office building that housed the Russian
consulate. I mentioned that there was a report in a Russian newspa-
per that Snowden had visited the Russian consulate in late June in
connection with the flight he later took to Moscow. “All we know is
he entered the building,” he answered, with a shrug.

That Russian consulate visit did not come as a complete surprise
to U.S. intelligence. After Snowden left the Mira, his interactions
with the Russian and Chinese intelligence services in Hong Kong
had been closely monitored by “secret means,” a term that in that
context likely indicated electronic surveillance. A former top intel-
ligence executive in Washington, D.C., subsequently confirmed this
monitoring to me. All of Snowden’s stealth in exiting from the Mira
hotel, which included wearing a baseball cap and dark glasses, thus

* Expand the first episode “Mathematics and Truth” into two or likely three episodes. I’m intrigued by this
because there is so much rich material - pure math, philosophy (discovered or invented), physics (Wigner’s
‘unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences)’, astrophysics, cosmology, biology,
general systems theory. I’ve felt frustrated in this first episode because there is so much material. I think
three episodes could work - if you agree, I’ll get back to you with a suggested structure of the 2 or likely 3
parts. Also, Closer To Truth has had only a few videos and one episode on mathematics per se (out of 277
episodes!), so this would be original and complementary. In this may, math would become about half the

* Integrated Information Theory - quantifying and explaining consciousness (Giulio Tononi, Un

* Evolutionary Dynamics - your program at Harvard - mathematical models. This is not an area of my

those of other intelligence agencies. It will be recalled that prior to the 9/11 attack in 2001, NSA
data had been protected by “stove-piping” that separated NSA’ computers from networks used by
other intelligence services. After the 9/11 Commission concluded that part of the reason why US
intelligence agencies were unable to “connect the dots” in advance of the attack was because this
“stove-piping, the NSA stripped away a large part of its “stove-piping.” One result was that the
NSANet, which Snowden had access to at Dell in 2012, became a shared network. It had
common access points. General Hayden described them to me as the equivalent of “reading
rooms” in a library. They served as a means for NSA workers to exchange ideas about the
problems they were encountering on various projects for the intelligence community. In
maintaining them, system administrators, or “system admins,” like Snowden acted as the
“librarians.” If a stem administrator copied data from this network, no one knew.

For Snowden, the NSANet, which included CIA and Defense Department documents,
provided a rich hunting ground for Snowden in the fall and winter of 2012. Many of the
documents he took off the NSANet revealed not only operations of the NSA but also those of the
CIA and Pentagon. By taking them he had come to a Rubicon from which there would be no
return. He later explained in an email to Vanity Fair from Moscow, “I crossed that line.”

As far as is known, he was not sharing them with any other party prior to May 2013. He was
not even yet in contact with Poitras, Greenwald or any other journalists. Presumably, Snowden
was collecting them drives, despite the risks that possessing such a collection of secrets might
entail, for some future use.

But why would Snowden jeopardize his career and, if caught, his freedom, by undertaking this
illicit enterprise? He may have had by now strong ideological objections the NSA’s global
surveillance. As he said later in Moscow, “we’re subverting our security standards for the sake of
surveillance.” But ordinarily even ideologically-opposed employees don’t steal state secrets and
risk imprisonment. If they are disgruntled, they seek employment elsewhere. Certainly,
Snowden, with his three years experience working for Dell, would have little problem finding a
job as an IT worker in the booming civilian sector of computer technology. Instead of resigning,
he sought to widen his access to NSA documents. This behavior suggests to me that he had
another agenda. One possible clue to it is the first document he took; the NSA exam. The secret
in that document, the answers to the questions, were a form of power to him: power to burrow
deeper into the executive structure of the NSA. It would unlock the door to door to even the
more powerful documents containing the NSA’s sources stored in Level 3 compartments. His
later actions demonstrated that he equated the possession of such secrets with personal power.
For example, after he arrived in Moscow in 2013, he bragged to James Risen of the New York
Times that he had access to secrets that gave him great leverage over the NSA. He told him
specifically his access to “full lists” of NSA’s agents and operation in adversary countries could,
if revealed, closed down the NSA’s capabilities to gather information in them.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030304.txt,"But a state grand jury found the witnesses in the case were not credible and threw out all
but the single charge of soliciting a hooker in his luxurious Palm Beach home. Epstein's
lawyers and friends now say he's the hapless victim of a vendetta by Palm Beach Police
Chief Michael Reiter, whom they describe as a born-again nut case.

According to the police investigation, a copy of which was obtained by the Palm Beach
Post, detectives took statements from 17 witnesses and five alleged victims. Haley
Robson, 20, a Palm Beach Community College student who described herself as like a
Heidi Fleiss, says she got naked to give Epstein a massage, then brought him six girls
ages 14-16 for massages and sex at his home. She said they were paid $200 per session.
Cops also allege that Epstein's personal assistant, Sarah Kellen, who hasn't been charged,
set up the liaisons and put fresh sheets on the massage table and supplied massage oils.
Police searched through Epstein's garbage and retrieved sex toys and feminine hygiene
products.

Epstein's Palm Beach lawyer, Jack Goldberger, told Page Six that the Florida state
attorney concluded the cops had looked at evidence from a one-sided perspective. He
added that Epstein had passed an extensive lie-detector test in which he was grilled about
underage girls.

Epstein's New York lawyer, Gerald Lefcourt, said, The prosecutor didn't want to bring
any charges in this case, but because of the craziness of this police chief, we have the
charge of solicitation.

Last night, WPTV in Palm Beach reported that one reason Robson's testimony may have
been dismissed is the kinky Web page she has on MySpace featuring photos of her
female friends playing with sex toys. One friend even uses the name Pimpin' Made EZ.
Robson, who isn't charged, also writes, Do what you do to make that money, life is

a gamble. Stay hustling.”

A spokeswoman for Reiter said, We think our investigation speaks for itself.

FORUM

GLOBAL
TIMES

CPC-led system a political innovation

Editor’s Note:

The Two Sessions, the annual meet-
ings of China’s top legislative and
advisory bodies, have been under
global spotlight for the past few
weeks. This year’s Two Sessions

are of extraordinary importance as
they have adopted the constitutional
amendments, restructured govern-
ment institutions and elected the new
national leadership. To understand
what the institutional changes mean
for China’s future, as well as the
policy agenda for the coming year,
Global Times (GT) Washington-
based correspondent Hu Zexi talked
‘o Dr. Robert Lawrence Kuhn (Kuhn)
who is a long-time China observer,
and author and editor of over 25
books. Kuhn has been invited to Bei-
jing to take a closer look at this year’s
Two Sessions.

GT: What kind of policy issues are

you following during the Two Ses-
sions?

Kuhn: The proposed amendments

to the Constitution of the People’s
Republic of China give a road map

of areas deemed critical. Several

of the provisions strengthen the
stability, continuity and robustness of
governance. Beyond these, I looked for
any deviations from expectations, for
example, on State-owned enterprise
reform or local government financing.
I also looked for any reaction to the
increased push-back against China’s
rising global capabilities from certain
countries.

GT: In recent years, the Chinese govern-
ment has made more efforts to make
Two Sessions’ agenda better meet public
expectations. For example, the govern-
ment will cooperate with media websites
to conduct surveys
about top policy areas
that the public wants
the Two Sessions to
address. How do you
evaluate such efforts?
Kuhn: Irrespective of the nature of the
political system or ideology, transpar-
ency in governance is the best way for
government to deliver effective, ef-
ficient programs, and enhance credibil-
ity. The Chinese government has been
striving to increase transparency, which
deserves praise.

The Two Sessions are a vehicle for
the government to communicate with
the people and engage them through
media in dealing with all the critical
issues.

GT: How do you see the political belief
of China that democracy should meet the
real or fundamental needs of the public?
Kuhn: Government performance and
democracy are not the same.

The former is indeed assessed by
alleviating poverty, reducing pollution,
improving healthcare and the like.
Democracy is the public participation of
common people in the complex process
of governance.

Thus, true democracy is much
broader than one-person-one-vote.

It includes, primarily, the capacity to
provide substantive input on complex

issues and to provide oversight in the
management of officials.

GT: China for long has argued that
democracy or any other political mecha-
nism should be developed on the basis
of a country’s specific condition. How do
you see this belief, as well as its practice?
Kuhn: Certainly, political systems dif-
fer, even between countries that have
the same ideology. Nonetheless, there
are great commonalities in the goals
and objectives shared by all countries
and people. I suspect that over time,
measured in not less than decades and
perhaps even centuries, there will be

a convergence of
systems toward
what I call with a
smile, “Optimiza-
tionism” — leaders,
officials, executives
making myriad decisions every day to
optimize outcomes without thinking of
the ideology.

GT: There’s talk about China’s unique
system of multiparty cooperation and
political consultation led by the Com-
munist Party of China (CPC) during the
Two Sessions. How do you observe this
system?

Kuhn: The benefits of a one-party-rule
are apparent: the coherence of policies,
rapid decision-making and formula-
tion of strategies that require long-term
consistency for long-term commitment.
But all systems of governance have
trade-offs, and two challenges of one-
party-rule are assuring that all rational
points of view, including dissenting
ones, are included in the decision-mak-
ing process; and systemic checks and
balances for oversight of officials at all
levels of government.

China’s system of multi-party co-
operation and consultation, led by the
CPC, is a political innovation in includ-
ing inputs and ideas from diverse seg-
ments of society, while still maintaining
harmony of spirit and consistency in

policies. But because of its scale and
power, the CPC, which is the ruling
party, has a higher obligation to pay
attention to other parties and voices. A
true democracy is measured by how the
majority treats the minority.

GT: As a decades-long observer of China,
what do you think the constitutional
amendment will bring to the country?
Kuhn: This constitutional amendment
is all about strengthening China’s
system of governance, especially the
Party’s leadership of the country and
President Xi Jinping’s leadership of the
Party and the nation.

Going by the whiplash of Western
reactions, one could be forgiven for as-
suming that the amendment is all about
abolishing term limits of the president
and vice president. In fact, there are 21
clauses in the constitutional amend-
ment and to understand where China
is going, one must gauge the meaning
and intent of all of them.

Xi has been consistent in respect-
ing, indeed in championing, China’s
Constitution, and by now amending it,
he underscores the congruity between
the realities of how China is governed
and what the Constitution says — thus
bolstering Xi’s commitment to the Rule
of Law.

Establishing the National Supervi-
sory Law and Commissions, expanding
the anti-corruption campaign to all
public organs and organizations, reaf-
firms Xi’s commitment to enhancing
the rule of law.

As for term limits, it is not that Xi
will hold the formal titles of leader-
ship for life, but that he will hold real
eadership long enough to bring about
China’s national rejuvenation and es-
ablish Chinese type democratic norms.

All factors considered, because of
China’s special conditions and Xi’s spe-
cial capabilities, abolishing term limits
may be good for China. It is commonly
said that China’s system of governance
can ensure stability and consistency,

which is a necessary requirement
for advancing reform.

GT: What do you see as the under-
lying reason for the institutional
restructuring of the government
passed during the Two Sessions?
Kuhn: The sweeping restructur-
ing of the Chinese government
streamlines the bureaucracy,
eliminates institutional conflicts
of interest between government
bodies, aligns authority with
responsibility, and, significantly,
enhances the leadership of the
Party in the management as well
as the oversight of the govern-
ment. Although the restructur-
ing has multiple motivations, a
prime driver is to support China’s
continuing development under
complex conditions — a slowing
economy, uncertain financial risk,
unacceptable pollution, the special
demands of innovation.

Given China’s challenges at
home and abroad the government
restructure is timely. Some media
outlets describe it as a “reshuffle,”
as if the random rearrangement of

a deck of cards. I beg to differ.

This restructuring is as deliberate as
it is far-reaching — and planned precise-
ly to address a host of contradictions.
The outcome is to strengthen CPC’s
leadership throughout the country. In
fact, deepening reform is now defined,
for state as well as for Party institutions,
as strengthening the CPC’s leadership
in every sector. The aim is consistency
and uniformity in implementing policy.

The announcement of the restruc-
turing followed swiftly after the adop-
tion by the National People’s Congress
of the constitutional amendment, and
although both were long in the works,
their rapid-fire sequence serves to un-
derscore the preeminence of President
Xi in setting the new agenda, and the
power of the Party in implementing the
new policies.

GT: Environment has always been a
heated topic at the Two Sessions. How
do you see the prospect of green develop-
ment in China?
Kuhn: | have been following China’s
environmental problems for over two
decades, and until recent years under
President Xi. While officials would of
course decry pollution, it only became
progressively worse. Companies flouted
the law. The minuscule fines were a
small price for not worrying about the
cost of controlling pollution. Officials
were loath to risk impeding economic
growth. Today is dramatically different.
President Xi has raised ecology and
environment to the highest category of
national priorities. Ecological progress
is among the five top goals (along with
economic, political, cultural and social
progress). Green is the third of the New
(Five Major) Concepts of Development.
The change in attitudes toward pollu-
tion is stunning. For example, fines for
corporate pollution now hurt.

were going to be a lot tougher. Israel now had control of the entire Sinai and the
Golan. To tap into enemy communications, we would have to push deeper
inside Egypt and Syria.

Soon after my return, we began planning the sayeret’s most ambitious
mission so far: targeting the main communications system between Suez City,
at the southern end of the canal, and Egyptian military headquarters in Cairo.
We were obviously going to have to go in by helicopter. But we faced not just
the risk of being spotted on the way in. The buildup of Egyptian forces along
the canal now included Soviet-made anti-aircraft missile batteries. We might
easily get shot down.

The mission struck the generals in the kirya as so risky as to border on the
insane. But I was confident that we could make it work. I began talking to the
few senior air force officers who seemed more receptive, as well as to officers
in the helicopter units. Not only had I flown into the Sinai on earlier missions. I
now also had a physics degree. Together, we developed a plan — using the desert
terrain, and drawing on the helicopters’ maneuverability — to calculate a flight
route that could avoid detection by Egyptian radar. As an extra fail-sale, I
proposed using three helicopters, and three sayeret teams. Two would fly
slightly higher, with the express aim of getting spotted, but still evading missile
fire. They would land far away from the real target of the operation. The main
team, with me in command, would also stage a pair of diversionary attacks:
planting explosives on a high-voltage electricity cable, and on the main oil
pipeline from Suez City to Cairo.

Still, for many weeks, the answer from the Airya was no. The man who had
succeeded Rabin as chief-of-staff after the war, Chaim Bar-Lev, dismissed it as
“a plan built on chicken legs.” In the end, what got us the green light was a
further escalation, on both sides, in the War of Attrition. In January 1970, Israeli
warplanes began a series of deep-penetration bombing raids, for the first time
striking targets dozens of miles, in some case hundreds of miles, back from the
canal. The Israeli bombing campaign reduced the chance we’d get shot down and
provided cover for our operation.

Our helicopters took off after sunset, nearly skimming the water and peeling
off in separate directions on the far shore. The other two aircraft headed 120
miles to the south. I led the main team of ten men. We set down a few miles
south of the road from Suez City to Cairo. We unloaded a pair of Jeeps, drove
off, and within an hour had placed our time-delay explosives on the electricity

Russia’s largest bank and the European Center for a Modern Ukraine, both with deep Kremlin ties.

The Clinton Foundation and Bill Clinton took millions from Kremlin-connected businesses.

No evidence has emerged of Trump-Russia collusion, and Mr. Mueller has yet to bring collusion-
related charges against anyone. Evidence suggests one of his targets, George Papadopoulos, was lured
to London, plied with the prospect of Russian information damaging to Mrs. Clinton, and taken to
dinner, where he drunkenly bragged that he’d heard about such dirt but never seen it. These
circumstances not only fail to suggest Mr. Papadopoulos committed a crime, they reek of entrapment.
The source of this information, former Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, admits Mr.
Papadopolous never mentioned emails, destroying any reasonable inference of a connection between

the DNC hack and the Trump campaign.

Crossfire’s progenitors thus ignored an obvious question: If Russia promised unspecified dirt on Mrs.
Clinton but never delivered it, how would that amount to collusion with the Trump campaign? If
anything, such behavior suggests an attempt to entice and potentially embarrass Mr. Trump by

dangling the prospect of compromising information and getting his aides to jump at it.

Given the paucity of evidence, it’s staggering that the FBI would initiate a counterintelligence
investigation, led by politically biased staff, amid a presidential campaign. The aggressive methods
and subsequent leaking only strengthen that conclusion. If the FBI sincerely believed Trump
associates were Russian targets or agents, the proper response would have been to inform Mr. Trump

so that he could protect his campaign and the country.

Mr. Trump’s critics argue that the claim of political bias is belied by the fact that Crossfire was not
leaked before the election. In fact, there were vigorous, successful pre-election efforts to publicize the
Trump-Russia collusion narrative. Shortly after Crossfire’s launch, CIA Director John Brennan and
Mr. Comey briefed Congress, triggering predictable leaking. Christopher Steele and his patrons

embarked on a media roadshow, making their dossier something of an open secret in Washington.

On Aug. 29, 2016, the New York Times published a letter to Mr. Comey from Senate Minority Leader
Harry Reid, saying he’d learned of “evidence of a direct connection between the Russian government
and Donald Trump’s presidential campaign,” which had “employed a number of individuals with
significant and disturbing ties to Russia and the Kremlin.” On Aug. 30, the ranking Democratic
members of four House committees wrote a public letter to Mr. Comey requesting “that the FBI assess
whether connections between Trump campaign officials and Russian interests” may have contributed
to the DNC hack so as “to interfere with the U.S. presidential election.” On Sept. 23, Yahoo News’s

78. Wholly absent at this point was any assertion by Mr. Dershowitz that Ms. Roberts
was lying, or that she made up her charge as part of an extortion claim, or that after investigating
his alleged evidence Ms. Roberts’ lawyer did not believe her. On the contrary, Mr. Dershowitz
expressly recognized that Ms. Roberts’ belief was an honest one. All Mr. Dershowitz was
pleading for was an acknowledgement that there was a “possibility” that there “may be” a case of
mistaken identification. Even that plea was rejected by Ms. Roberts and her lawyers as
misleading.

79.  Dershowitz’s present PR claim that Roberts’ lawyers disbelieved their client, and
that Roberts intentionally committed perjury as part of an extortion scheme, is just another
Dershowitz lie. His reliance on statements taken out of context, his failure to include the
statements of Roberts’ lawyer after Dershowitz’s supposed evidence had been investigated, and
the damning admissions of his own lawyers, reveal Dershowitz’s total lack of support for his
allegation that Roberts and her lawyers concocted knowingly false allegation against him as part
of a supposed extortion plot.

80. Dershowitz also lied to attempt to deflect Sarah Ransome’s revelations about him.
Ms. Ransome revealed that during the time she was a victim of Epstein’s sex trafficking,
Epstein’s arranged for his lawyer, Dershowitz, to also represent Ms. Ransome. Ms. Ransome
also described how, during the time Dershowitz was her lawyer, Epstein lent her out to
Dershowitz for sex. (Exhibit 14).

81. Dershowitz asserted that he never had sex with Ms. Ransome, that he never
represented Ms. Ransome, that he did not even know Ms. Ransome, and that Ms. Ransome’s

A new book claims Jeffrey Epstein played a key role in a shady Palm Beach real estate deal between President
Donald Trump and a Russian oligarch.

Michael Wolff’s forthcoming book, “Siege,” details the 2004 property deal that involved the future president,
Deutsche Bank, a child predator and an ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin, reported The Guardian.

ADVERTISING

According to Wolff's account, Epstein showed his friend Trump a $55 million mansion he planned to buy, but
Trump instead went behind his back to buy the foreclosed property for about $40 million.

Epstein didn’t believe Trump could raise that much money on his own, through an entity called Trump
Properties LLC that was entirely financed by Deutsche Bank, Wolff wrote.

The billionaire financier knew Trump had been loaning out his name in real estate deals for a fee, and he
suspected the freshly minted reality TV star was fronting for the mansion’s real owners.

Epstein threatened to expose the deal until he found himself under investigation by Palm Beach police for child
sex abuse and human trafficking, and he eventually served 13 months in county jail as part of a controversial
plea agreement brokered by Trump’s future Labor Secretary Alex Acosta.

Trump later put the mansion on the market for $125 million, despite making only minor improvements to the
property.

It was purchased for $96 million by Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Kremlin-linked industrialist — which meant Trump
made $55 million on the deal despite risking none of his own money.

Wolff offers two possible theories for the deal.

The author suspects that Trump may have earned a fee for hiding a shadow owner who possibly was funneled
cash by Rybolovlev for reasons beyond the property’s value.

Or, Wolff theorizes, Rybolovlev essentially bought the house from himself, with Trump as an intermediary, to
launder ill-gotten money.

“This,” Wolff wrote, “was Donald Trump’s world of real estate.”

Rybolovlev tore down the mansion in 2016 and sold off the property as three lots for less than the $115 million
he had invested in it.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

A. Epstein’s Conviction for Sex Crimes and Designation as a Level Three Sex Offender

In June 2008, a Florida Court sentenced Jeffrey Epstein to eighteen months in prison after
he pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a fourteen-year-old girl. Affirmation of John M.
Browning dated December 21, 2018 (“Browning Aff.”), Ex. A.

After serving thirteen months of his sentence, Epstein was released and required to
register as a sex offender in New York, where he owned property and sought to reside. /d. Ex.
B. The New York State Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders (““NYBSO”) recommended that
Epstein be designated a level three sex offender — which is the level reserved for the most
dangerous sexual predators — because investigators in Florida had found compelling evidence
that Epstein had abused scores of underage girls, despite only pleading guilty to solicitation of a
single minor. Epstein, 89 A.D.3d at 570, 933 N.Y.S.2d at 240.

Remarkably, New York Assistant District Attorney Jennifer Gaffney ignored the NYBSO
recommendation and asked the trial court tasked with deciding Epstein’s sex-offender status to
designate him as a level one offender only, which is the least-restrictive category possible and is
typically applied to offenders who pose the lowest risk of committing further crimes. Jd. ADA
Gaffney argued that, since “there was only an indictment for one victim,” Epstein should not be

placed under the heavy scrutiny required for the most dangerous class of abusers. /d. Ex. B. For

smile in response, suggesting that such diagnoses were probably best left to the
professionals. I couldn’t pretend, however, that emotional engagement with new
acquaintances, even with people I knew and liked but were not close friends,
was something that came naturally. And it is also true that from my first
experience of the world of numbers as a child on the kibbutz, and as I tackled
ever more elaborate pieces on the piano, I did become aware of what might be
called the upside of “a touch of Aspergers” — if that, indeed, is what it is. I was
conscious of the ease with which my brain translated the complexities into
pictures in my mind. And the joy, at times, with which it allowed me to play
around with, and develop, what I saw.

By the summer of 1967, I had experienced that feeling again, in my first real
encounter with theoretical physics at Hebrew University. After the Six-Day
War, I began seriously contemplating a future as a research scientist, or perhaps
eventually a professor of physics. Two months after the war, I enrolled in a
summer program at the Weizmann Institute, Israel’s preeminent postgraduate
research facility. Surrounded by some of the country’s, even the world’s,
leading scientists, and by post-doctoral students determined to follow in their
footsteps, was intellectually enthralling. But it turned out to have another effect
on me as well. As I thought more and more about the prospect of joining their
fraternity once I’d completed my undergraduate degree, I also heard them
describe the way in which pure science sometimes got submerged in simple
routine, or, more discouragingly, in the politics and positioning and backbiting
of the academic world.

I think what finally changed my mind, however, was a feeling, nurtured on
the kibbutz but solidified by that many nights I’d spent leading sayeret
operations across our borders, that I would find my true purpose in life trying to
make some special contribution to the future course of Israel. I did not for a
moment contemplate politics at that point. Instead, I thought of going back into
the military. I realized that in order to make a significant mark, if indeed I
could, would require me to serve in the regular army, not just an extraordinary
unit like Sayeret Matkal. But I did hope that, at some stage, I’d be given the
opportunity to finish my time in the sayeret as its commander, carrying on
Avraham’s vision and, ideally, building and expanding on it as well. At least if
that part proved possible, I felt that, by comparison, a career in academia would
be somehow blinkered, and surely less fulfilling personally. My sayeret
experience had also taught me something else as well: that protecting Israel’s
security was not just a matter of muscle, or firepower, indispensible though they

top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive
information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the

Russian government.”

That these leaking efforts failed to prevent Mr. Trump’s victory, or that Mr. Comey’s ham-fisted
interventions might have also hurt Mrs. Clinton’s electoral prospects, does not diminish the legal

significance of the anti-Trump bias shown by government officials.

B. Method of Compensation and Notification.

During this same time period, you and others, including the former Solicitor General of the
United States Kenneth Starr, took issue with the implementation of the methodology of
compensation (hereinafter “the 2255 provision”)’ and the SDFL’s intention to notify the victims
under 18 U.S.C. Section 3771 (you objected to victims being notified of time and place of Epstein’s
state court sentencing hearing). In response, the SDFL offered, in my opinion, numerous and various
reasonable modifications and accommodations which ultimately resulted in United States Attorney
R. Alexander Acosta’s December 19, 2007 letter to Lilly Ann Sanchez. In that letter, the United
States Attorney tried to eliminate all concerns which, quite frankly, the SDFL was not obligated to
address, let alone consider. He proposed the following language regarding the 2255 provision:

“Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an offense enumerated in
Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, will have the same rights to proceed under
Section 2255 as she would have had, if Mr. Epstein been tried federally and convicted of an
enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing this paragraph, the United States shall
provide Mr. Epstein’s attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to name in
an Indictment as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any judicial authority
interpreting this provision, including any authority determining which evidentiary burdens
if any a plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these
identified victims in the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been
convicted at trial. No more; no less.”

Regarding the issue of notice to the victims, USA Acosta proposed to notify them of the
federal resolution as required by law; however, “[w]e will defer to the discretion of the State
Attomey regarding whether he wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings,
although we will provide him with the information necessary to do so if he wishes.” As you know,

_ you rejected these proposals as well. See December 26, 2007 correspondence from J ay Lefkowitz
to USA Acosta. .

? Prior to any issues arising concerning the implementation of the 2255 provision, the SDFL
unilaterally agreed to assign its responsibility to select the attorney representative for the alleged victims
to an independent third-party. This was done to avoid even the appearance of favoritism in the selection
of the attorney representative. As a result, on October 29, 2007, the parties executed an Addendum
wherein it was mutually agreed that former United States District Court Judge Edward B: Davis would
serve as the independent third-party. Judge Davis selected the venerable law firm of Podhurst and
Josefsberg to represent the approximately 34 alleged identified victims.

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011708.txt,"I’d been impressed by President Bush’s political acumen in assembling an
international coalition including the key Arab states. Through Unit 8200 in
military intelligence, we would only very occasionally get verbatim transcripts
of his conversations as he brought first the Saudis and other Gulf states on
board, then Morocco, and eventually even Syria. More often, I’d see the
President’s deft diplomacy second-hand, through intercepts of Arab leaders’
communications with one another. But the picture which emerged was of an
American president deftly able to stake out common ground, and common
interests, with each of the Americans’ growing number of anti-Saddam allies.

When we entered the Oval Office on the evening of February 11, Bush was
flanked by Secretary of State Baker, Defense Secretary Cheney and national
security adviser Brent Scowcroft. Also there was Colin Powell, a general whom
I had got to know well, and to like, over the past few years and who was now
head of the joint chiefs-of-staff. Given the seriousness of our mission, the start
of the meeting was almost surreal. The Americans had obviously been told that
I was born on February 12. Since it was just past midnight in Israel, they began
by wishing me a happy 49 birthday.

Yet pleasing thought that was, it became clear there was a disconnect
between the tension among Israeli government ministers, and ordinary Israelis,
back home and the relaxed, self-assured, at times even jovial mood of the
President and his inner circle. Their primary focus was clearly not on Israel, but
on the overwhelming success of their air attacks on Iraq and the approach of a
ground offensive that they were confident would finish the job. That didn’t
seem to change even after a truly extraordinary interruption to our meeting,
when one of Misha’s aides passed on the news that a Scud had struck the Tel
Aviv suburb of Savyon, where Misha himself ltved. He immediately excused
himself and went to phone his wife, Muriel, to confirm she was fine. When he
returned, despite their pro forma words of empathy, it seemed almost as if the
Americans thought we had cooked up the entire thing for political effect.

Bush did say the right things as the discussion turned to the missile attacks
on Israel. He told us he understood our frustration, and the pain the Scud
launches were inflicting. He appreciated our restraint. I have no doubt that all of
that was true. But the message we’d been sent to deliver clearly wasn’t hitting
home. As politely but as clearly as I could, I told President Bush that while we
didn’t want to do anything to undermine the coalition, unless someone else took
care of the Scuds, we would have no choice but to act.

A potential recession, combined with increasing regulatory threats for some of the biggest

Why it matters: The biggest tech companies have already raked in billions of dollars in 
profits and benefited from major tax cuts that aren't going to be repeated, so next year isn't 
likely to be better for them financially. They've also been dogged by scandals that have left 
many questioning their positive role in society, and if on top of that the economy starts to 
slip, 2019 could be worse. 
People look for scapegoats in a bad economy. And with big tech already on its heels, a 
downturn probably would feed arguments that the largest internet companies are too big 
and need to be reined in. 
— Paul Gallant, an analyst with Cowen Washington Research Group 
Big Tech is closing out a contentious year in Washington, and potential regulation will 
continue to haunt it well into 2019. 
• Google CEO Sundar Pichai has agreed to testify before Congress, and will likely be 
asked about whether the company is being transparent about its data privacy practices and 
any potential bias. By the year's end, the CEOs of Twitter, Google and Facebook will have 
been called to testified in front of Congress for the first time ever during 2018. 
• Lawmakers in the United States are pushing for a federal privacy law with an urgency 
likely to be exacerbated by more breaches like the one Marriott disclosed last Friday. 
• The Federal Trade Commission still has an open investigation into whether 
Facebook's conduct violated a previous settlement with the agency. Margrethe Vestager, 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033420 
Europe's aggressive commissioner overseeing competition, is still investigating aspects of 
Google's business and whether Amazon plays fair in the market for generic products. 
• President Trump has said his administration is seriously looking into monopolistic 
behavior of Facebook, Google and Amazon. 
Some analysts predict an economic slowdown___even if it doesn't lead to a recession like 
the one in 2008___will be enough to change the global attitude around big American 
companies. 
So the really shocking thing this year is that the only major economy in the world where 
growth has actually accelerated this year is America. And this is because of the tax cuts, the 
deregulation, the other stimulus which has been put into work. And that has also helped the 
earnings of companies. My point is, from next year onwards, those effects begin to fade. 
— Ruchir Sharma, chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley on Fareed Zakaria GPS  
on Sunday 
The FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) that pushed the 
stock market to record highs have not been immune from this year's market rout. 
• The mood has changed. Investors are asking a lot more questions right now, says 
Larry Glazer, a Managing Partner at Mayflower Advisors, which manages $3 billion. 
Momentum has faded on these names. 
• Adding to potential concern: possible regulatory action could translate into higher 
costs, particularly for Google or Facebook. 
• Facebook has been under such a dark cloud for so long that now everybody is 
expecting the worst, Paul Meeks, a technology portfolio manager at Wireless Fund, told 
Amos. 
The other side: I don't see a looming recession. And even if there was, people aren't going 
to target these companies if there is a recession, says Nicholas Economides, Professor of 
Economics at NYU Stem School of Business. 
• Economides argues that, even if there was a mild reduction in GDP growth, it 
wouldn't significantly impact the high tech sector. 
• For companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter, their main revenue streams are 
from ads. They gain market share from brands converting traditional ad spend to digital ads. 
This conversion is not so dependent on the growth of GDP, because they are still in the 
process of converting ads of different formats to digital ads, and that's something that will 
continue, regardless of GDP growth. 
The bottom line: Tech companies that have long been the darlings of investor portfolios 
will likely find themselves in much weaker positions.

I'm a reporter at CNN, and my colleague Blake Ellis and I have read that Bill Clinton and Donald 
Trump have both visited Epstein's private island. We are trying to determine whether there is any 
truth to the allegations that either or both of these men may have had sexual relations with minors 
while there. We know that you have been Epstein's pilot, so we're wondering if you would be willing 
to speak with us completely off the record. We are not focusing on the allegations against Epstein --
we are solely focusing on Trump and Clinton given the current allegations being levied in the press.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030476.txt,"is she? At this point, I am so bored of repeating myself to others—it was, after all, my 2003 Vanity Fairstory
that really brought him into the limelight—that I have decided to write about this myself.

Bizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to know Jeffrey and Ghislaine far better after my piece than before it. I kept
running into both of them, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of
young women with him who stand two feet behind him, as if serving a monarch. “Do they speak?” I remember
asking him once, nodding at his lookalike blondes. He laughed. “Not like you, Vicky,” was his riposte.

I remembered that when we'd once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I hadn’t
studied math since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a package at
home via messenger. It was a book: “Math for idiots.”

So he is not without humor, even though he doesn’t drink or smoke, and hates restaurants.

“Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects,” newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He
was certainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few
moments in his company and you know this to be true.

When I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that
“Andy’—as Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his
strange title is. Because if one thing’s for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what
he’s talking about far more than “Andy” does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other
financiers hang out with him.

And Ghislaine?
Full disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It’s almost impossible not to.

She is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I’ve spent hours
talking to her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is
curious. She has spent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent
me a DVD of the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away almost anyone else’s I can think of—probably even
Rupert Murdochs’. She is very well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill
Clinton with whom she is close friends.

Yet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 4oth birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-
Platero, (known fondly to her close friends as “the Tennis Goddess”) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When
it comes down to things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her vulnerability.
And that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey.

“He saved her,” I remember a close friend of mine telling me. “When her father died, she was a wreck;
inconsolable. And then Jeffrey took her in. She’s never forgotten that—and never will.”

In many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect
replacement for her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his
sexual pecadillos, but then Ghislaine’s father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving
a massive “black hole” he’d fraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey's habits may not have seemed that
strange.

In fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful
people in the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl
issues, and moved countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You
don’t tend to get to the top by being the world’s most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett
didn’t quite manage a normal life—whatever that is. He had a second “wife” for many years whose existence he
has been open about.

So what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven’t spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her

Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General 
Office of the Deputy Attorney General 
United States Department of Justice 
950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Room 4115 
Washington, D.C. 20530 
Dear Mr. Roth: 
Facsimile: 
I again want to thank you for this opportunity to explain why we believe that a federal 
prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein is unwarranted. I appreciate your having informed us that you 
already have our May 19 and May 27 communications to the Deputy Attorney General, as well 
as our prior written submissions to CEOS and to the Southern District of Florida. 
In light of the significant volume of our prior submissions and to facilitate your review, 
we have drafted four supplemental submissions that will provide a roadmap for your 
investigation of this matter. Given the bulk of these documents and their appended supporting 
attachments, you will receive this packet by messenger tomorrow. A brief description of each of 
the four submissions follows. First, I have included a succinct summary of the facts, law and 
policy issues at hand. This document sets forth a basic overview of the issues and summarizes 
our principal contentions as to why federal prosecution of this matter is neither appropriate nor 
warranted. 
The three other submissions include: a summary of the irregularities and misconduct that 
occurred during the federal investigation; a letter from former CEOS attorney Stephanie Thacker 
that responds to CEOS 's assessment of its limited review of Mr. Epstein's case; and a point-by-
point rebuttal to First Assistant United States Attorney Jeffrey Sloman's recent letter which we 
believe contains factual inaccuracies typical of our correspondence from the United States 
Attorney's Office in Miami (the USAO). Also, for your reference, the package you receive 
tomorrow will contain a binder including all documentation to which we refer in our 
submissions. Finally, we will be providing a detailed checklist of each submission or substantive 
communication to the USAO. Our intention is that you have copies of each such document to 
enhance your review. If there are any that you have not received from the USAO or CEOS, 
please advise and we will fedex them to you without delay.

As you are likely aware, the Department's prior review of this matter was incomplete 
and, by its own admission, not de novo. See Tab 38, May 15, 2008 Letter from A. Oosterbaan. 
Without considering the Non Prosecution Agreement that left this matter to be resolved in the 
State or any of the misconduct, CEOS reviewers, tasked with reviewing some of their own 
previously expressed opinions, assessed only whether the United States Attorney would abuse 
[his] discretion if he pursued this case. While we appreciate CEOS' s willingness to examine 
these limited issues, its conclusion that a prosecution would not be an abuse of discretion rings 
particularly hollow in light of CEOS 's admirably candid concessions that we have raised 
compelling objections and that a prosecution on these facts would require novel applications 
of federal law. Indeed, even a brief review of CEOS's own mission statement reveals how 
inapposite a federal prosecution is to the facts in this case. 
Importantly, we note that the CEOS review was conducted prior to the Supreme Court's 
very recent decisions in Santos and Cuellar, which we believe—illuminating as they do the 
Court's interpretive methodology when it comes to federal criminal law—powerfully 
demonstrate the substantive vulnerability of the USAO's unprecedented employment of three 
federal laws. That Office's interpretation would never pass muster under the Supreme Court's 
recent pronouncements and should not be countenanced. That is all the more true under the 
circumstances where the duly appointed U.S. Attorney opined that, in effect, the unitary 
Executive Branch was driving this prosecution. We now know that is not so. 
What I respectfully request, and what I hope you will provide, is a truly de novo 
review—that is, an independent assessment of whether federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein is both 
necessary and warranted in view of the legal and evidentiary hurdles that have been identified, 
the existence of a State felony plea and sentence that have been advocated by the State Attorney 
for Palm Beach County, and the many issues of prosecutorial misconduct and overzealousness 
that have permeated the investigation. I also request that you provide us with the opportunity 
during your review to meet with you in person to answer any questions you may have and to 
elucidate some of the issues in our submission. 
We believe that an independent review will confirm our strong belief that federal 
prosecutors would be required to stretch the plain meaning of each element of the enumerated 
statutes, and then to combine these distorted elements in a tenuous chain, in order to convict Mr. 
Epstein. Indeed, just this week (and after two years of federal involvement in this matter), 
Assistant United States Attorney Villafana re-initiated the federal grand jury investigation—in 
direct contravention of the parties' Non Prosecution Agreement—and issued yet another 
subpoena seeking evidence in this case. See Tab 19, Subpoena to In the 
subpoena, AUSA Villafana directs_____________________to appear on July 1, 2008 to give testimony 
and produce documents to FGJ 07-103 West Palm Beach. The attachment to the subpoena seeks 
documents such as photographs, emails, telephone billing information, and contact information 
that relate to Mr. Epstein as well as specific other people who received protection from federal

prosecution as a result of Mr. Epstein's having entered into the September 24, 2007 Non 
Prosecution Agreement with the USAO. 
Notably, the Non Prosecution Agreement contains the following agreed condition: 
Further, upon execution of this agreement and a plea agreement with the State Attorney's Office, 
the federal Grand Jury investigation will be suspended, and all pending federal Grand Jury 
subpoenas will be held in abeyance unless and until the defendant violates any term of this 
agreement. The defendant likewise agrees to withdraw his pending motion to intervene and to 
quash certain grand jury subpoenas. 
See Tab 21, September 24, 2007 Non Prosecution Agreement. It also guarantees that persons 
identified in the Grand Jury subpoena such as_________________________________and Leslie Groff 
and others will not be prosecuted. The new Grand Jury subpoena clearly violates the Non-
Prosecution Agreement. Although Mr. Epstein has exercised his rights to appeal to the 
Department of Justice with the full consent and knowledge of the USAO, he has not breached the 
Agreement. The re-commencing of the Grand Jury is in violation of the Agreement. 
But further, the new investigation, which features a wide-ranging, fishing-expedition type 
to search in New York does nothing to satisfy the very essential elements of federal statutes that 
are lacking despite the intensity of an over two-year investigation in the Palm Beach area. 
Absent evidence of Internet luring, inducements while using the phone, travel for the purpose, 
fraud or coercion, the subject of the New York investigation is as lacking in the essential basis 
for converting a state case into a federal case as is the remainder of the Florida investigation. 
The reaching out to New York to fill the void emanating from the failures of the Florida 
investigation compellingly demonstrates the misuse of federal resources in an overzealous, over-
personalized, selective and extraordinary attempt to expand federal law to where it is has never 
gone. This last-ditch attempt by Ms. Villafana reinforces our belief that the USA() does not have 
facts that, without distortion, would justify a prosecution of Mr. Epstein. 
In view of the prosecution's often-verbalized desire to punish Mr. Epstein, we believe 
that the prosecution summary suffers from critical inaccuracies and aggregates the expected 
testimony of witnesses so as to reach a conclusion of guilt. Our contention is reinforced by the 
fact that key prosecution witnesses have provided evidence and testimony that directly 
undermines the prosecution's misleading and inaccurate summary of its case. Indeed, we now 
have received statements from three of the principal accusers— _  (through a state 
criminal deposition), (through a federal FBI-USAO sworn and transcribed 
interview), and (through a defense—generated sworn transcribed interview). 
Each of these witnesses categorically denies each essential element that the prosecution will have 
to prove in order to convert this quintessential state-law case into a federal matter.

KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP 
John Roth, Esq. 
June 19, 2008

It thus is especially troubling that the USAO has not provided us with the transcript of 
's federal interview, nor the substance of the interviews with Ms. or Ms. 
, nor any information generated by interviews with any of the approximately 40 alleged 
witnesses that the prosecution claims it has identified. Because the information provided by 
these women goes directly to the question of Mr. Epstein's guilt or innocence, it is classic Brady 
information. We understand that the U.S. Attorney might not want to disclose impeachment 
information about their witnesses prior to a charge or during plea negotiations. But we firmly 
believe that when the Government possesses information that goes directly to a target's factual 
guilt or innocence, the target should be informed about such heartland exculpatory evidence. 
Most importantly, aside from whether the Department believes Brady obligates 
disclosure to a target of a federal investigation prior to the target's formal accusation, no such 
limit should apply to a Department review. Accordingly, we request that you go beneath the face 
of any summary provided to you by the USAO and instead review the actual witness transcripts 
and FBI 302s, which are essential for you to be able to make a truly independent assessment of 
the strength and wisdom of any federal prosecution. 
After careful consideration of the record, and as much as it pains me to say this, I simply 
do not believe federal prosecutors would have been involved at all in this matter if not for Mr. 
Epstein's personal wealth and publicly-reported ties to former President Bill Clinton. A simple 
Internet search on Mr. Epstein reveals myriad articles and news stories about the former 
President's personal relationship with Mr. Epstein, including multi-page stories in New York 
Magazine and Vanity Fair. Mr. Epstein, in fact, only came to the public's attention a few years 
ago when he and the former President traveled for a week to Africa (using Mr. Epstein's 
airplane)—a trip that received a great deal of press coverage. I cannot imagine that the USA() 
ever would have contemplated a prosecution in this case if Mr. Epstein lacked this type of 
notoriety. 
That belief has been reinforced by the significant prosecutorial impropriety and 
misconduct throughout the course of this matter. While we describe the majority of these 
irregularities in another submission, two instances are particularly troubling. First, the USA() 
authorized the public disclosure of specific details of the open investigation to the New York 
Times—including descriptions of the prosecution's theory of the case and specific terms of a plea 
negotiation between the parties. Second, AUSA Villafana attempted to enrich friends and close 
acquaintances by bringing them business in connection with this matter. Specifically, she 
attempted to appoint a close personal friend of her live-in boyfriend to serve as an attorney-
representative for the women involved in this case. 
It also bears mentioning that actions taken by FAUSA Sloman present an appearance of 
impropriety that gives us cause for concern. Mr. Sloman's former law partner is currently 
pursuing a handful of $50-million lawsuits against Mr. Epstein by some of the masseuses.

KIRKLAND &ELLIS LLP 
John Roth, Esq.

Page 5 
Finally, as you know, Mr. Epstein and the USA() entered into an agreement that deferred 
prosecution to the State. In this regard, I simply note that the manner in which this agreement 
was negotiated contrasts sharply with Mr. Sloman's current representation that [Vile SDFL 
indicated a willingness to defer to the State the length of incarceration . . .  See Tab 1, May 19, 
2008 Letter from J. Sloman, p. 2. This statement is simply not true. Contrary to Mr. Sloman's 
assertion, federal prosecutors refused to accept what the State believed to be appropriate as to 
Mr. Epstein's sentence and instead, insisted that Mr. Epstein be required serve a two-year term of 
imprisonment (which they later decreased to 18 months plus one year of house arrest). Federal 
prosecutors have not only involved themselves in what is quintessentially a state matter, but their 
actions have caused a critical appearance of impropriety that raises doubt as to their motivation 
for investigating and prosecuting Mr. Epstein in the first place. 
At bottom, we appreciate your willingness to review this matter with a fresh—and 
independent—set of eyes. To facilitate your review, I once again request the opportunity to 
make an oral presentation to supplement our written submissions, and we will promptly respond 
to any inquiries you may have.

Cadogan Tate Sponsors New Sensations Art Exhibition

Filed under art moran body shop

(PRWEB) October 17, 2010

Cadogan Tate, the world class art moving, storage and shipping specialist in contemporary art, has sponsored the
‘New Sensations 2010’ exhibition for UK art students. Organised by Channel 4 and The Saatchi Gallery, this
prestigious event aims to discover the most imaginative and talented artists graduating from BA and MA courses
in the UK and to support students leaving art college.

A total of 20 students were shortlisted to present their work in the exhibition. This is being held at Boswall House,
2 Cornwall Terrace — a magnificent 18th century building off Regent’s Park — from 14th to 20th October. The
event forms part of ‘The House of the Nobleman’, under the curatorship of Wolfe von Lenkiewicz and Victoria
Golembiovskaya.

Four of the finalists in New Sensations 2010 — Pablo Wendel, Katie Surridge, Nika Neelova and Ula Wiznerowicz —
have each been given a bursary to develop a new work for the exhibition. A short film about each of them was
aired on Channel 4 in early October.

Stephen Glynn, Cadogan Tate’s Fine Art Director, comments: “We are delighted to be the sponsors of this
important exhibition, which showcases the talent of some remarkable young artists. We have spent many years
transporting and storing the world’s most precious contemporary art for leading museums, galleries and
collectors. It therefore seemed very appropriate that we should support and encourage the UK’s leading art
students through this exciting event.”

devious. And every now and then,

computers can have a mind of their own.

Having the capacity to reason
about other minds enables people to
form deep social connections with
others, to empathize with others’ pain
and share in their joy, and to anticipate
others’ actions. But having a capacity
and actually using it are two different
things. People are not naturally inclined
to see invisible things in the
environment. People do not
automatically see into other minds,
either, but instead do so only under
certain circumstances and with some
psychological effort. This chapter will
describe how people come to see other
minds, how other minds can become
more or less visible, and why the
visibility of other minds matters for
everyday life.

Kinds of Minds

Studying how people understand
other minds first requires understanding
how people intuitively define another
mind. Research suggests that people
think of minds as having two distinct
dimensions, the ability to act (agency)
and the ability to feel (experience)’.
Mindful agency involves the cognitive
activities that enable action, such as the
capacity to plan, to have intentions, to
engage in deliberate self-control, and to
pursue one’s own goals. Conscious
preferences, attitudes, and beliefs follow
from these capacities. Mindful
experience, in contrast, involves the
cognitive activities involved in reacting
to the external world, such as the
capacity for self-awareness, and the
experience of basic psychological states
(like hunger, thirst, or pain), and other-
oriented emotions (such as empathy or
sympathy). Mindful experience also

Page |94

involves the capacity for
metacognition—the capacity to think
about one’s own thoughts or emotions—
exemplified in experiences such as
confidence and doubt, or in secondary
emotions such as shame, guilt, joy, or
hope. People seem to represent these
two capacities in others quite
independently. A sociopath, for
instance, can appear to act with a high
degree of mindful agency but no mindful
experience, whereas a baby might appear
full of mindful experience with
relatively little mindful agency. Seeing
other agents as mindful essentially
means seeing them as able to
consciously think and/or to feel.

Because you are aware of both your own
thoughts and feelings, you likely
consider yourself—like most people
do—to be very mindful.

Making Other Minds Visible

Introspection provides a kind of
flashlight that seems to provide direct
access to one’s own agency as well as
experience. Although research
demonstrates that introspection is
actually a process of indirect inference,
it appears to us that introspection
provides direct access to the workings of
our own brain. It seems that we can look
on the inside and fee/ when we are
suffering, know when we are
experiencing regret, or be aware of our
intentions to lose weight. We can use
our introspective abilities to make
inferences about what others are likely
thinking or feeling (and we very often
do), but such inferences are likely to
seem inherently less direct, less
immediate, and less illuminating. We
cannot see into other minds as clearly as
we seem able to see our own.

When something is difficult to
see, people may doubt whether it

new world. The bad news is that the worst of them (and often the best of them skill
wise) did this at times by swiping your data, your money and finally your peace of
mind. Their fortunes and safety and curiosity — all of these are woven together in
their hot hunger to touch and pull and break the roots of the network. In a world of
expanding connection, they are both more powerful and more dangerous than ever.

3.

Networked systems of our age are confronted, constantly, with diverse, dangerous
challenges, each informed by that Gordian paradox so familiar to us by now: The
more connected we are, the greater the risks. And as bank balances, secret jet
engine designs, and other priceless digital data are developed and then slipped
safely away on connected machines, the rewards for cracking into the systems grow
- far faster than the (near zero) costs of trying to break in. “It is increasingly
obvious,” security researchers F.X. Lindner and Sandro Gaycken have said, “that the
state of the art in Computer Network Defense is over a decade behind its
counterpart in Computer Network Offense. Even intelligence and military
organizations, considered to be the best positioned to defend their own
infrastructures, struggle to keep the constant onslaught of attackers with varying
motives, skills and resources at bay.”!35 The long list of failed US government
security attempts express a strange digital logic: The more essential it is that an
organization keep a secret, the less it seems able to do so. A decade behind? That is
the gap between a flip phone and an iPhone. In the hyperspeed world of technology
it is like confronting a laser weapon with a hoplite. The losing race slips easily
enough into Donald Rumsfeld’s aheader-behinder dynamic, the one that haunts the
paradoxes of national power we face now. Are we killing more terrorists than the
madrassas are producing? Rumsfeld wondered. We can ask: Are we plugging more
machines with more layers, software and applications than we can protect? Are we
making more bugs than we're patching? (Yes and yes.) “Attackers are not like
natural catastrophes,” Lindner and Gaycken write. “They can analyze their targets.”

Bratus, a math genius who turned to computer science out of curiosity and now
teaches at Dartmouth, has spent a fair amount of time trying to understand just
what happens when a computer or a network is exploited by a hacker, or “pwned” in
the funny idiom of Warez Dudes language. (The phrase means to take control, or to
“own” a system. The spelling is an artifact of an overenthusiastic video-game death
match gloat, in which one player killed another and in his rush to celebrate typed
something along the lines of “I pwned you!” The mis-typing lives today: The highest
award in hacking is known as The Pwnie.) Bratus calls the resulting, pwned device a

historically are rates borrowers are contracted to pay. Interest rates realized by
lenders are less for two reasons. There are friction costs of due diligence,
contracting and collection. Default costs, slight when times are good, can be

catastrophic when times are bad.

Homer and Sylla describe normal contracted rates, not realized rates net of those
costs, as 10% — 40% in Sumer and Babylonia, 6% - 18% in ancient Greece, 5% —
24% in Egypt, and 4% — 12+% in Rome and the Byzantine Empire.* After higher
rates in the dark ages, European mortgages and commercial loans found the range
7% — 25% in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The range settled down to
4% — 14% in the sixteenth century,° and to 3% — 10% by the seventeenth and
eighteenth’. The authors comment:® “...interest rates declined during much of the
later Middle Ages and Renaissance. The earliest short-term rates quoted were
somewhat higher than the last and highest of the western Roman Legal limits. They
were not too different from early Greek rates and were within the range of
Babylonian rates... The later Renaissance rates were well within the range of
modern rates and the lowest were far below modern rates in periods of credit
stringency.” Merchants of Venice in Shakespeare’s time and long before borrowed
from banks, not from Shylocks, and at rather lower cost than merchants of the

twentieth century.

Economics and Biology

Bioeconomics has meant economics informed by biology. I argued that this
describes much or all of classical economics from Petty through Mill, then lapsed
when the marginalists preferred to do without any explanations or justifications of

tastes, and revived a century later to explore Hamilton’s rule.

I was gone for six months, and I returned in heartbreak. A relationship more important
than words can encompass had become -- after years of attempts -- impossible. I think it
was obvious. One friend told me vulnerability was all over me; /ike a scent, I thought,
and wondered if Richard could smell it. In worse shape than ever, I saw Richard and
laughed with an edge to my voice. I gave him doe-eyed looks, but deflected his interest
with doublespeak and icy tones. I wanted him, and I felt the rage returning. I hated and
sheltered behind the unclear verbal games we played. Furious and despairing, I refused to
chase him, yet I felt him everywhere. North.

I had to do something. My identity had somewhat solidified: I was into BDSM. I believed
it, I even accepted it, but I couldn't go on feeling like I did.

In looking around the Internet, I came upon a directory of Kink Aware Professionals,
including therapists who provided their names for people who needed to talk about
BDSM but feared judgment. I visited two. One listened to me silently, with a vaguely
sorrowful expression; he offered no feedback, and left me wondering why he'd listed his
name in the directory. He obviously didn't know what to do with me, and I got the uneasy
feeling that I worried him. Naturally, that didn't help at all.

Luckily, the other was everything I could have asked for -- open, patient, clearly
knowledgeable about BDSM. He looked straight at me and nodded understandingly when
I confessed the whole trail of events; he explained how common my experience was; he
gave me ideas about where to look for more information, but didn't try to put his own
preferences into our talks. Most people in your situation feel that they've broken a major
taboo, he said. A lot try to get away from BDSM. But I'm not hearing that from you.
You want to adjust, not escape. I nodded, and arranged to see him regularly.

Still, I don't think I could have put myself together again without two other things.

My close friend Andrew went after me at a drunken party. Shades of Richard, | might
have thought, but I never did. Andrew pinned me to the floor, laughed as I fought back,
hurt me, finally kissed me. When I asked in bewilderment what brought this on, he
confessed. When you were gone, I missed you, he whispered, and I've never missed
anyone like that before. He was as afraid of the darkness of BDSM as I had been, yet
he'd thought of me and found himself fantasizing. He wanted to try it with me, but first he
wanted to be sure that he and I would remain close -- wouldn't lose what we already had.

In everything Andrew told me -- everything we said to each other, laughing, almost in
tears, burying each other in embraces, happily drunk and clear-eyed in the morning -- I
found the things that were missing with Richard. Uncertain about BDSM, guarding his
and my boundaries, Andrew wanted to commit to me and to a devoted monogamous
relationship. Part of me counseled caution and withdrawal, but as my therapist laughingly
put it, Andrew was as tempting as an ice-cream factory. It was my chance to fall
straightforwardly in love.

Soon after that, I had to explain to my parents why I wanted a psychiatrist who was out-
of-network for my health insurance. I closed my eyes as my father asked why I needed
this specialist, what his focus was. S&M, I said shortly.

(b) Closed-Circuit Transmission for Victims. In order to permit victims of crime to watch criminal trial proceedings, the court
may authorize closed-circuit televising of the proceedings for viewing by victims or other persons the court determines have a
compelling interest in doing so.

The Rationale:

The CVRA grants victims the right to attend trials, as noted previously in connection with proposed Rule 43.1. 74° At the same

time, however, the CVRA recognizes that in situations with numerous victims, the court may have to craft a reasonable
procedure to protect victims’ rights. 34! One such reasonable procedure would appear to be closed-circuit transmission of
court proceedings to a facility sufficiently large to accommodate all the victims. This was the procedure followed in the
Oklahoma City bombing case. *47

[*923] The proposed rule would authorize such transmission in appropriate cases. The language for the proposed rule comes
from 42 U.S.C. /0608(a), which authorizes closed-circuit transmissions notwithstanding any provision of the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure to the contrary in cases in which a proceeding has been transferred more than 350 miles - as was the case
with the Oklahoma City bombing trial. In light of the CVRA's mandate that the court must always craft a reasonable
procedure to protect the rights of multiple victims, there is no compelling reason to tie the device to such geographical
circumstances. The proposed rule authorizes courts to allow such transmissions in any appropriate case.

Rule 58 - Victims and Petty Offenses
The Proposal:
Courts should hear from victims regarding sentences in petty cases as follows:

Rule 58. Petty Offenses and Other Misdemeanors.

(3) Sentencing. The court must give the defendant an opportunity to be heard in mitigation and then proceed immediately to
sentencing. The court must also give victims an opportunity to be heard. The court may, however, postpone sentencing to allow
the probation service to investigate or to permit either party to submit additional information.

The Rationale:

The CVRA gives a victim the right to be heard at sentencing. The CVRA defines victim as including anyone who is
directly and proximately harmed by a Federal offense. *47 The Act does not limit those offenses to felonies or
misdemeanors. Accordingly, a victim has a right to be heard at sentencing for any petty offense, as would be reflected in the
proposed rule.

[*924]
Conclusion

The CVRA commands that victims be made participants in the federal criminal process and thus requires significant changes to
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. This Article has provided one possible and comprehensive way to implement that
congressional command with specific language and supporting analysis for each change. Undoubtedly there are other ways of

Robert Lawrence Kuhn — March 5, 2018

HOST: You were there at the Great Hall of the People. What was
your main takeaway from what some have described as Li

Keqiang’s impossible challenge: how to deleverage, how to take
away stimulus, and still keep 6.5% growth?

RLK: I don’t take the 6.5% growth as the primary objective here.
I mean you have to look at what these National Peoples
Congresses are. They’re not setting the vision and the strategy.
That was set at the party congress in October. What we're dealing
here is the implementation of the policies. If you attend these
every year you know they all look and sound the same because
it’s the same structure, same kind of structure of numbers, so
what you do is look for the differences. What are those subtle
differences between one year and another. That’s what I focus on
at these congresses.

HOST: What’s the main difference you saw?

Sheila and Marcia led me up the stairs to my loft bed, and we had a
delicious threesome. It had never happened before, and it would never
happen again.

At one point in our conversation, Groucho somehow got into a
negative space. He was equally cynical about institutions, such as marriage--

“legal quicksand” --and individuals, such as Lyndon Johnson, referred to

as “that potato-head.”

Eventually, | asked, “What gives you hope?”

"
IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021426.txt,"The items you list are false or distorted. Item 1 refers falsely and inaccurately to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006
where we mutually decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, and there were respectful
and platonic encounters afterwards. There is nothing to comment on in item 3, which involves an anonymous 3rd party claim

because | know nothing about it, there are no details provided, and it clearly was not taken seriously enough to result in any university
action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying that because | decided | didn’t want to go out to a bar with a group of attendees that | was
harassing them? The second part did not happen. Re incident 5: The ‘female companion’ in this case is my wife, who can attest to
the fact that the claim is false, which is what | wrote at the time in response to the blog in question, causing it to be taken down.

It is worth responding to Item 2 and 6 in more detail,

Re item 2: the student in question was interested in science communication, and on dozens of occasions came to me or wrote to me
with questions. When she asked about advice for after graduation | DID tell her she was different than the other students in her

year. The rest of them were interested in going on to graduate school, but she was interested in science communication so | told her
that she might want to take a different path. Since she was the only woman in her year, as | recall, | did ask her on one of these
occasions if that made it difficult for her in any way. | asked, because as a faculty member | was interested in knowing what we could
do, if necessary to encourage more women to go into physics, and also because as someone she had asked for career advice from |
wanted to know if that made a difference to her. Re asking her for dinner.. | have gone back over emails from that period. | have
numerous requests from her asking me to go for coffee to talk, which | usually had to turn down because | was busy, and on several
occasions sh specifically asked me to have coffee with her off campus to talk, and | politely declined. | did let her accompany me off
campus one time to watch me do a BBC interview because she specifically requested it. | did and do have coffee and meals with
students on campus, and | see nothing wrong with this. | try to treat even students as respected colleagues if possible. | was shocked
when | later learned of the complaint she was apparently asked to lodge to the University, not least because there was no
inappropriate interaction and also because, well after the dates you listed on which she was apparently offended, she continued to
email me with joking questions or comments. Also, at a later AAAS conference, again in 2008, for which she had asked, and for
which | had written her a letter of recommendation to attend, my wife and | gave her a lift in our taxi well out out of our way in order to
drop her off at her hotel, and | note in an email response to her email about the conference, agin in 2008, | expressed that | would
pass her regards along to my wife and vice versa. When the University later informed me of the complaint | was shocked and
concerned. When | spoke to the human resources person, including relating my concerns and providing the emails in question, | was
told that no formal complaint of sexual harassment was deemed at that time to be called for, and that the young woman in question
had agreed to that. By that time | learned of the complaint | had already announced my intentions to leave Case to accept an offer at
ASU—a very difficult decision for me because of my long-standing attachment to the University, and the excellent relations | had with
my colleagues there, both among the faculty and among the administration. Because | was already in Arizona at the time | was asked
not to have any further interaction with the student | agreed to that request, both to respect her sensitivities and also because it was
basically moot because | was not on campus. | was also told that because it was being handled informally, that (a) it should remain
confidential, which |, at least abided by, and (b) if no further complaints were lodged in that case, that the University would remove the
complaint from my record after 5 years, which makes me surprised that someone violated that written agreement with you.

Re item 6: You report on ASU’s response to item #6 , without including the fact that the University specifically stated there were never
any allegations of sexual misconduct or harassment by me at the University, and morever the outside complaints were in fact related
specifically to your item #6. Further you neglect to mention that this complaint was by an anonymous third party, not the individual
who was allegedly harassed, who never lodged a complaint, and that no specific evidence was provided of the alleged

transgression. | was surprised and dismayed that both ASU and ANU launched investigations on the basis of this but was told by both
Universities that because of my high profile even such unsubstantiated third party complaints at private events unrelated to the
University would be investigated. The complaint was investigated throughly by both ASU and ANU and both came to the conclusion
that it was not credible and no university policies had been violated. . In addition ANU’s investigation, which took a full month found
significant inconsistencies in the allegation, suggesting distortion and fabrication, | will quote from the ANU report. The initial
complaint, which in fact resulted in a temporary suspension of my position at ANU, until it was dismissed, outlined the claim you made
in the words you quoted in your note to me, but it also stated

It is the University’s understanding that a complaint was lodged directly to the conference organisers at the time of the incident.”

After the month-long investigation, during which | was told | was not to interact with anyone on campus (again moot because | was a
hemisphere removed) the final report absolved me of any wrongdoing, and indicated information inconsistent with the original claim
and apparent later claims as follows in the report, from which | quote:

The allegations were made by an observer to the incident.

- The complaint did not identify, nor disclose the identity of the conference attendee who was allegedly touched in

an unwelcome manner.

- The conference attendee who took the ‘selfie’ photo did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference organisers
at the time of the incident (November 2016).

- The conference attendee who witnessed the incident, did not lodge a formal complaint to the conference organisers
at the time of the incident (November 2016).

The photo submitted as part of the complaint does not provide evidence of any physical contact.

- The complainant alleged that a photo exists, showing your hand on the breast of the conference attendee who took
the ‘selfie’ photo. This photo was not made available to the Australian National University, although it was requested
in the course of the investigation.”

(And for the record | often put my hand up in front of a camera if there is a flash, as | specifically request selfies not to include flashes,
so that | don’t end up with a series bright spots in front of my eyes for the next half hour)

and reference checks; ensuring that the contract spells out exactly what services and deliverables (such as written status
reports or other documentation) Consultant is providing; training Consultant on the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws;
requiring Consultant to represent that he will abide by the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws; including audit rights in the
contract (and exercising those rights); and ensuring that payments requested by Consultant have the proper supporting
documentation before they are approved for payment.

Part 2: Distributors and Local Partners

Assume the following alternative facts:

Instead of hiring Consultant, Company A retains an often-used local distributor (Distributor) to sell Company A's
products to the Ministry of Immigration. In negotiating the pricing structure, Distributor, which had introduced the project
to Company A, claims that the standard discount price to Distributor creates insufficient margin for Distributor to cover
warehousing, distribution, installation, marketing, and training costs and requests an additional discount or rebate, or, in
the alternative, a contribution to its marketing efforts, either in the form of a lump sum or as a percentage of the total
contract. The requested discount/allowance is significantly larger than usual, although there is precedent at Company
A for granting this level of discount in unique circumstances. Distributor further advises Company A that the Ministry's
procurement officials responsible for awarding the contract have expressed a strong preference for including a particular
local company (Local Partner) in the transaction as a subcontractor of Company A to perform installation, training, and
other services that would normally have been performed by Distributor or Company A. According to Distributor, the
Ministry has a solid working relationship with Local Partner, and it would cause less disruption for Local Partner to perform
most of the on-site work at the Ministry. One of the principals (Principal 1) of the Local Partner is an official in another

government ministry.

What additional compliance considerations do these alternative facts raise?

As with Consultant in the first scenario above, Company A should carefully vet Distributor and Local Partner and their
roles in the transaction in order to minimize the likelihood of incurring FCPA liability. While Company A has an established
relationship with Distributor, the fact that Distributor has requested an additional discount warrants further inquiry into
the economic justification for the change, particularly where, as here, the proposed transaction structure contemplates
paying Local Partner to provide many of the same services that Distributor would otherwise provide. In many cases, it may
be appropriate for distributors to receive larger discounts to account for unique circumstances in particular transactions.
That said, a common mechanism to create additional margin for bribe payments is through excessive discounts or rebates
to distributors. Accordingly, when a company has pre-existing relationships with distributors and other third parties,
transaction-specific due diligence—including an analysis of payment terms to confirm that the payment is commensurate
with the work being performed—can be critical even in circumstances where due diligence of the distributor or other third
party raises no initial red flags.

Company A should carefully scrutinize the relationship among Local Partner, Distributor, and Ministry of Immigration
officials. While there is nothing inherently illegal about contracting with a third party that is recommended by the end-user,
or even hiring a government official to perform legitimate services on a transaction unrelated to his or her government
job, these facts raise additional red flags that warrant significant scrutiny. Among other things, Company A would be
well-advised to require Principal 1 to verify that he will have no role in the Ministry of Immigration’s decision to award
the contract to Company A, notify the Ministry of Immigration and his own ministry of his proposed involvement in the
transaction, and certify that he will abide by the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws and that his involvement in the
transaction is permitted under local law.

BDSM Resources

BDSM is a 6-for-4 deal of an acronym that stands for Bondage, Discipline, Dominance,
Submission, Sadism, and/or Masochism. Some people call it S&M, B&D, leather, fetish,
or kink. BDSM can mean very different things to different people, and there are a lot of
activities that can fall under the BDSM umbrella; such activities might include spanking,
Master/slave role-playing, handcuffs, cages, rape fantasies, razor blades, or all kinds of
other things.

I mention a lot of resources in the articles that I've included in this book, but I wanted to
include an overview at the beginning, too.

Hands down, I believe that one of the most important resources within the BDSM
community is the Kink Aware Professionals list. If you are seeking medical, legal or
other professional help for a problem that is influenced by alternative sexuality, there is
probably someone on the list who can help you. When I was going through my own
complicated and difficult BDSM coming-out process, I tried two therapists from the KAP
list. One of them didn't really get me, but the second was wonderfully helpful -- so, if
you're looking for a therapist, don't be afraid to shop around until you find the right fit.
The list is here: https://ncsfreedom.org/resources/kink-aware-professionals-directory/kap-
directory-homepage.html

Want more information on how BDSM interfaces with the psychiatric establishment?
I've compiled the research here: http://clarissethorn.com/blog/2012/05/07/the-
psychology-of-sm/

Books

In 2012, the legendary educator Tristan Taormino released The Ultimate Guide To Kink:
BDSM, Role Play and the Erotic Edge, which is supposed to be amazing. I haven't read it
myself, though.

My personal favorite beginner BDSM books are The New Topping Book and The New
Bottoming Book, by Dossie Easton and Janet W. Hardy. If you look for those books on
Amazon.com, you will also see a lot of interesting related books in the Customers Who
Bought This Item Also Bought section. I remember liking Jay Wiseman's SM/01/,
although I know some people who have mixed feelings about it; a number of people
recommend Screw The Roses, Send Me The Thorns by Philip Miller and Molly Devon,
but I've never read it myself.

If you're thinking of coming out to a loved one, I recommend the book When Someone

August 3, 2016 marked the 50™ anniversary of groundbreaking
comedian Lenny Bruce’ s death from an overdose of morphine, while his
New York obscenity conviction at Café Au Go Go was still on appeal. On
that same day he received a foreclosure notice at his Los Angeles home.

But it wasn’ t a suicide. In the kitchen, a kettle of water was still
boiling, and in his office, the electric typewriter was still humming. He had
stopped typing in mid-word: “Conspiracy to interfere with the 4
Amendment const” ...constitutes what, | wondered.

Lenny was a subscriber to my satirical magazine, 7he Realist and in
1959 we met for the first time at the funky Hotel America in Times Square.
He was amazed that | got away with publishing those profane words for
which other periodicals used asterisks or dashes. He had been using
euphemisms like “frig” and asked, “Are you telling me this is legal to
sell on the newsstands?”

| replied, “The Supreme Court's definition of obscenity is that it has
to be material which appeals to your prurient interest.” He magically
produced an unabridged dictionary from the suitcase on his bed, and

looked up the word “prurient.” He closed the dictionary, clenching his

° Earlier this year, at a Q&A event to promote your new book, the conversation came around to the

Nations General Assembly which issued in November 26, 1947 a
resolution dividing Palestine into two states: A Jewish state
consisting of 54 percent of the territory of Palestine, an Arab state
consisting of 44 percent of that territory, and the Jerusalem Area, as a
Corpus Separatum, consisting of 2 percent of Palestine.
Furthermore, the Resolution decided to have an Economic Union
between the two states and stipulated that the Jerusalem Area, which
included Bethlehem, should be a separate area under the control of
the UN.

The Zionist leadership pretended to accept the resolution, relying on
the fact that it would be refused by the reactionary Arab leadership.
After the UN Resolution, clashes broke out among the two
communities. The armed Zionist organizations, well prepared and
organized, as well as heavily armed, defeated the poorly armed
Palestinians and the weak unorganized Arab armies.

They occupied and annexed 70 percent of Jerusalem and 50 percent
of the territory allocated to the Arab State, and on May 15, 1948,
declared the State of Israel on 78 percent of historical Palestine
territory, leaving the Palestinians without a state and in limbo.

All these events happened in collusion among the colonial British
government, the Jewish Agency and some Arab regimes, ruled and/or
controlled by the British.

Aftermath of the 1948 War

As mentioned above, there was an enlarged Jewish state [Israel], but
the remaining territories of Palestine were either annexed to Jordan
[The West Bank], or put under Egyptian rule [The Gaza Strip].

So, the Palestinian people, who constituted 67 percent of the
population of Palestine in 1947 and owned 93 percent of its land,
were betrayed and left in a state of destitution.

Sixty-two percent of them were driven out of their home under
gunpoint and in several massacres committed by armed Zionist

cross-debarment by multilateral development banks, and the

suspension or revocation of certain export privileges.

Debarment

Under federal guidelines governing procurement,
an individual or company that violates the FCPA or other
criminal statutes may be barred from doing business with the
federal government. The Federal Acquisition Regulations
(FAR) provide for the potential suspension or debarment
of companies that contract with the government upon
conviction of or civil judgment for bribery, falsification or
destruction of records, the making of false statements, or
“[cJommission of any other offense indicating a lack of busi-
ness integrity or business honesty that seriously and directly
affects the present responsibility of a Government contrac-
tor or subcontractor.” These measures are not intended
to be punitive and may be imposed only if “in the public’s
interest for the Government's protection.”*“

Under the FAR, a decision to debar or suspend is dis-
cretionary. The decision is not made by DOJ prosecutors or
SEC staff, but instead by independent debarment authorities
within each agency, such as the Department of Defense or
the General Services Administration, which analyze a num-
ber of factors to determine whether a company should be sus-
pended, debarred, or otherwise determined to be ineligible
for government contracting, Such factors include whether
the contractor has effective internal control systems in place,
self-reported the misconduct in a timely manner, and has
taken remedial measures.*® If a cause for debarment exists,
the contractor has the burden of demonstrating to the satis-
faction of the debarring official that it is presently responsible
and that debarment is not necessary.** Each federal depart-
ment and agency determines the eligibility of contractors
with whom it deals. However, if one department or agency
debars or suspends a contractor, the debarment or suspension
applies to the entire executive branch of the federal govern-
ment, unless a department or agency shows compelling rea-
sons not to debar or suspend the contractor?”

Although guilty pleas, DPAs, and NPAs do not result

in automatic debarment from U.S. government contracting,

FCPA Penalties,
Sanctions, and
Remedies

committing a federal crime and the factual admissions
underlying a resolution are factors that the independent
debarment authorities may consider. Moreover, indictment
alone can lead to suspension of the right to do business
with the government.* The US. Attorney’s Manual also
provides that when a company engages in fraud against the
government, a prosecutor may not negotiate away an agen-
cy’s right to debar or delist the company as part of the plea

bargaining process.

In making debarment determina-
tions, contracting agencies, including at the state and local
level, may consult with DOJ in advance of awarding a con-
tract. Depending on the circumstances, DOJ may provide
information to contracting authorities in the context of
the corporate settlement about the facts and circumstances
underlying the criminal conduct and remediation measures
undertaken by the company, if any. This information shar-
ing is not advocacy, and the ultimate debarment decisions
are squarely within the purview of the independent debar-
ment authorities. In some situations, the contracting agency
may impose its own oversight requirements in order for a
company that has admitted to violations of federal law to be
awarded federal contracts, such as the Corporate Integrity
Agreements often required by the Department of Health

and Human Services.

Cross-Debarment by Multilateral Development
Banks

Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), like the
World Bank, also have the ability to debar companies and
individuals for corrupt practices.” Each MDB has its own
process for evaluating alleged corruption in connection
with MDB-funded projects. When appropriate, DOJ and
SEC work with MDBs to share evidence and refer cases.

the short term on inflation to ensure they have sufficient room to ease in the event of a
downturn. However, it is unlikely that the Fed would tolerate a sustained overshoot of
their inflation objective. That is particularly the case if the Fed under President Trump is
made more hawkish as our economists think it probably will be (see Liquid Insight:

Equally, our economists in Europe are sceptical on the ECB’s ability to get inflation to
rise significantly from current levels. Optically there is scope for European breakevens
to head higher if the ECB were to be successful but investors are likely to want to see
some evidence of rising inflation first before they price that in. We will return to this
below. For now we agree with our fixed income strategists that the rise in inflation
expectations is probably sufficient and that any rise in yields from here has to be one of
higher real yields.

They think such a rise as a tightening of monetary conditions which may be self-limiting
in the short term, particularly as the fiscal boost in the US is likely to be back loaded in
terms of 2017. If rates move too quickly and the USD follows before the fiscal stimulus
kicks in they could actually dampen growth. Indeed, our US economists have shaved
their near term growth forecasts already to reflect the current moves. They do not
expect the fiscal stimulus to start to boost growth before the 3” quarter.

Fiscal + hawkish Trump Fed means we stay short 5Y US via 2-5-10 butterfly

Our fixed income team estimated how much fair values of the different parts of the
curve would have to move were the market to move into line with the dot plot. Updating
those estimates for the move since their publication we find 2Y rates can move another
11bp, 5Y 39bp and 10Y 33bp. They argue that given we are past the inflection point for
rates, with fiscal policy being eased and now with a more hawkish Fed under Trump
likely, the dot plot should form the floor not the ceiling for rate expectations. All of this
translates into a view that 10Y yields can push to 2.65% by the second half of 2017.
Given their views on the curve we continue to run the 2-5-10 butterfly. It has moved
from around -10bp to +10bp since the election, and our fixed income strategists have
moved their target to +20bp.

1. Ping An & CICC are the 2 H shares that operate in the middle of Alibaba, Tencent, Lufax.

A. The chart below represents a deep dive we did on the new world of Chinese banking. Companies
like Zhong An, WeBank and Lufax will grow dramatically and will take advantage of (as well as
support) the massive worlds of Alibaba and Tencent. Together, Alibaba and Tencent have market cap
of $500 bn. Popping up in many of these areas of overlap are Ping An and CICC. They are
strategically placed to make great strides in China. This is slowly being recognized in the case of Ping
AN (See Page 8 of attached PPT). Ping An's market cap is $97 bn. It is connected to Zhong An.. It
owns 44% of Lufax. And some if its management were the very ones that started WeBank. It is
perfectly positioned for the coming boom in new banking. It has the best combined ROA and ROE
globally and its P/E of 10x is trading on a 50% discount to the global averages. Why is Ping An
trading at a discount to AIA? BUY PING AN -- SELL AIA..

B. The other company which has the best return on capital of any broker dealer -- and is also

positioned nicely for the coming boom in the new era of banking in China -- is CICC. CICC and CDH
(a CICC breakaway) both invested in Zhong An and Lufax. CICC has vision and a proven track record.

S3608

U.S. SENATE,
Washington, DC, June 6, 2011.
Hon. ERIC H. HOLDER, Jr.,
Attorney General; U.S. Department of Justice,
Washington, DC.

DEAR ATTORNEY GENERAL HOLDER: I am
writing about the Justice Department’s im-
plementation of the Crime Victims’ Rights
Act--an act that I co-sponsored in 2004.
These questions relate to an Office of Legal
Counsel (“OLC’’?) Opinion made public on
May 20, 2011 and more broadly to concerns I
have heard from crime victims’ advocates
that the Department has been thwarting ef-
fective implementation of the Act by failing
to extend the Act to the investigative phases
of criminal cases and by preventing effective
appellate enforcement of victims’ rights. I
am writing to ask you to answer these ques-
tions and explain the Department’s actions
in these areas.

GOVERNMENT PROTECTION OF VICTIMS’ RIGHTS
DURING INVESTIGATION OF A CRIME

When Congress enacted the CVRA, it in-
tended to protect crime victims throughout
the criminal justice process—from the inves-
tigative phases to the final conclusion of a
case. Congress could not have been clearer in
its direction that using ‘“‘best efforts’’ to en-
force the CVRA was an obligation of
“Colfficers and employees of the Department
of Justice and other departments and agen-
cies of the United States engaged in the de-
tection, investigation, or prosecution of crime

. .? 18 U.S.C. §8771(c)(1) (emphasis added).
Congress also permitted crime victims to as-
sert their rights either in the court in which
formal charges had already been filed “or, if
no prosecution is underway, in the district
court in the district in which the crime oc-
curred.” 18 U.S.C. §38771(d)(3) (emphasis
added).

Despite Congress’ clear intention to extend
rights to crime victims throughout the proc-
ess, the Justice Department is reading the
CVRA much more narrowly. In the recent
OLC opinion, for example, the Department
takes the position that ‘“‘the CVRA is best
read as providing that the rights identified
in section 377l(a) are guaranteed from the
time that criminal proceedings are initiated
(by complaint, information, or indictment)
and cease to be available if all charges are
dismissed either voluntarily or on the merits
(or if the Government declines to bring for-
mal charges after the filing of a complaint).”
The Availability of Crime Victims’ Rights
Under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act of 2004,
Memorandum from John E. Bies (Dec. 17,
2010, publicly released May 20, 2011) (herein-
after “‘OLC Opinion’’). Indeed, in that same
opinion, I am surprised to see the Depart-
ment citing a snippet from my floor remarks
during the passage of the CVRA for the prop-
osition that crime victims can confer with
prosecutors only after the formal filing of
charges. See id. at 9 (citing 150 Cong. Rec.
$4260, S4268 (Apr. 22, 2004) (statement of Sen.
Kyl).

I did want to express my surprise that your
prosecutors are so clearly quoting my re-
marks out of context. Here is the full pas-
sage of my remarks, which were part of a
colloquy with my co-sponsor on the CVRA,
Senator Feinstein:

Senator Feinstein: Section .. . (a)(5) pro-
vides a right to confer with the attorney for
the Government in the case. This right is in-
tended to be expansive. For example, the vic-
tim has the right to confer with the Govern-
ment concerning any critical stage or dis-
position of the case. The right, however, is not
limited to these examples. I ask the Senator if
he concurs in this intent.

Senator Kyl: Yes. The intent of this sec-
tion is just as the Senator says. This right to
confer does not give the crime victim any

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

right to direct the prosecution. Prosecutors
should consider it part of their profession to
be available to consult with crime victims
about concerns the victims may have which
are pertinent to the case, case proceedings or
dispositions. Under this provision, victims are
able to confer with the Government's attorney
about proceedings after charging.

150 Cong. Rec. S4260, S4268 (Apr. 22, 2004)
(statements of Sens. Feinstein & Kyl) (em-
phases added). Read in context, it is obvious
that the main point of my remarks was that
a victim’s right to confer was ‘‘intended to
be expansive.”’ Senator Feinstein and I then
gave various examples of situations in which
victims could confer with prosecutors, with
the note that the right to confer was ‘‘not
limited to these examples.’ It is therefore
troubling to me that in this opinion the Jus-
tice Department is quoting only a limited
portion of my remarks and wrenching them
out of context to suggest that I think that
crime victims do not have any right to con-
fer (or to be treated with fairness) until after
charging.

In giving an example that the victims
would have such rights after charging, I was
not suggesting that they had no such right
earlier in the process. Elsewhere in my re-
marks I made clear that crime victims had
rights under the CVRA even before an indict-
ment is filed. For example, in the passage
quoted above, I made clear that crime vic-
tims had a right to consult about both ‘‘the
case’’ and ‘‘case proceedings’’—i.e., both
about how the case was being handled before
being filed in court and then later how the
case was being handled in court “pro-
ceedings.”’ As another example, Senator
Feinstein and I explained that we had draft-
ed the CVRA to extend a right to victims to
attend only ‘‘public” proceedings, because
otherwise the rights would extend to grand
jury proceedings. See, e.g., 150 Cong. Rec.
54260, S4268 (Apr. 22, 2004) (statements of
Sens. Feinstein & Kyl). Of course, no such
limitation would have been necessary under
the CVRA if CVRA rights attach (as the De-
partment seems to think) only after the fil-
ing of a grand jury indictment.

Courts have already rejected the Justice
Department’s position that the CVRA ap-
plies only after an indictment is filed. For
example, in In re Dean, 527 F.3d 391 (5th Cir.
2008), the Department took the position that
crime victims had no right to confer with
prosecutors until after the Department had
reached and signed a plea agreement with a
corporation (BP Products North America)
whose illegal actions had resulted in the
deaths of fifteen workers in an oil refinery
explosion. Of course, this position meant
that the victims could have no role in shap-
ing any plea deal that the Department
reached. In rejecting the Department’s posi-
tion, the Fifth Circuit held that “the govern-
ment should have fashioned a reasonable
way to inform the victims of the likelihood
of criminal charges and to ascertain the vic-
tims’ views on the possible details of a plea
bargain.”’ Id. at 394.

In spite of this binding decision from the
Fifth Circuit, crime victims’ advocates have
reported to me that the Justice Department
is still proceeding in the Fifth Circuit and
elsewhere on the assumption that it has no
obligations to treat victims fairly or to con-
fer with them until after charges are for-
mally filed. Given the Fifth Circuit’s Dean
decision, this position appears to place the
Department in violation of a binding court
ruling that extends rights to thousands of
crime victims in Louisiana, Mississippi, and
Texas. And more generally, the Depart-
ment’s position simply has no grounding in
the clear language of the CVRA.

My first question: What is the Justice De-
partment doing to extend to victims their

right to fair treatment and their right to
confer with prosecutors when the Justice De-
partment is negotiating pre-indictment plea
agreements and non-prosecution agreements
with defense attorneys, including negotia-
tions within the Fifth Circuit?
CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHT TO APPELLATE
PROTECTION

Protection of crime victims’ rights in ap-
pellate courts is an important part of the
CVRA. As you know, when Congress passed
the CVRA, the federal courts of appeals had
recognized that crime victims could take or-
dinary appeals to protect their rights. See,
e.g., Doe v. United States, 666 F.2d 43, 46 (4th
Cir. 1981) (rape victim allowed to appeal dis-
trict court’s adverse ‘“‘rape shield statute”
ruling); United States v. Kones, 77 F.3d 66 (8rd
Cir. 1996) (victim allowed to appeal adverse
restitution decision). Congress sought to
leave these protections in place, while ex-
panding them to ensure that crime victims
could obtain quick vindication of their
rights in appellate courts by providing—in
§3771(d)(3)—that ‘“‘{i]f the district court de-
nies the relief sought, the [victim] may peti-
tion the court of appeals for a writ of man-
damus.”” 18 U.S.C. §8771(d)(3). Ordinarily,
whether mandamus relief should issue is dis-
cretionary. The plain language of the CVRA,
however, specifically and clearly overruled
such discretionary mandamus standards by
directing that ‘‘[t]he court of appeals shall
take up and decide such application forthwith
.... 18 U.S.C. §3771(d)(3) (emphasis added).
As I explained when the Senate considered
the CVRA:

{[W]hile mandamus is generally discre-

tionary, this provision [18 U.S.C. §3771(d)(3)]
means that courts must review these cases.
Appellate review of denials of victims’ rights
is just as important as the initial assertion
of a victim’s right. This provision ensures re-
view and encourages courts to broadly defend
the victims’ rights.
150 Conc. REc. $4270 (Apr. 22, 2004) (state-
ment of Sen. Kyl) (emphases added). Simi-
larly, the CVRA’s co-sponsor with me, Sen-
ator Feinstein, stated that the Act would
create “‘a new use of a very old procedure,
the writ of mandamus. This provision will
establish a procedure where a crime victim
can, in essence, immediately appeal a denial
of their rights by a trial court to the court
of appeals.”’ 150 Conc. REc. $4262 (statement
of Sen. Feinstein) (emphases added): see also
id. (statement of Sen. Kyl) (crime victims
must ‘“‘be able to have ... the appellate
courts take the appeal and order relief). In
short, the legislative history shows that
§3771(d)(3) was intended to allow crime vic-
tims to take accelerated appeals from dis-
trict court decisions denying their rights and
have their appeals reviewed under ordinary
standards of appellate review.

In spite of that unequivocal legislative his-
tory, the Justice Department has in past
cases asserted a contrary position. In In re
Antrobus, 519 F.3d 1123 (10th Cir. 2008), Ken
and Sue Antrobus sought to obtain appellate
review of a ruling by a trial court that they
could not deliver a victim impact statement
at the sentencing of the man who sold the
murder weapon used to kill their daughter.
The Tenth Circuit ruled against them on the
basis that the Antrobuses were not entitled
to regular appellate review, but only discre-
tionary mandamus review. See id. at 1124-25.
The Tenth Circuit did not consider the legis-
lative history in reaching this conclusion,
leading the Antrobuses to file petitions for
rehearing and rehearing en banc—petitions
that recounted this legislative history. In re-
sponse, the Justice Department asked the
Tenth Circuit to deny the victims’ petitions.
Remarkably, the Justice Department told
the Tenth Circuit that it could ignore the

It is also a mistake to blame Wall Street chicanery. Chicanery is a fact of life, and
Wall Street has more than its share. But I can testify, from a ringside seat, that many

But my read was that the presenters were sold themselves.
The problem is not in the people. It is in the inherent fragility of deposit-and-lend

closer look at the problem.

Credit Risk is More than Leverage

Some leverage is a good thing. Firms issue bonds as well as stocks in order to attract
a wider range of investors. Risk-averse investors may choose the safety of bonds,
whose interest claims are paid first, while risk tolerant ones may be happy with the
iffier but more promising equity remainder. Leverage in general is a way to satisfy

both these constituencies.

Credit risk rises with term (duration) as well as amount of debt. One of the most
telling points in Siegel’s Stocks for the Long Run is that corporate bonds of 15 years
or more have proved more volatile in real total return than equities have. No
wonder. A corporate bond will have ample debt coverage (gross profit/debt service)
at date of issuance, and an appropriate credit rating. What will both be fifteen years

from now?

Homeowners also typically borrow long-term. They expect to have children in local

schools, husbands and/or wives in local jobs, and other roots in the community. But

What the Middle East Needs
Now from America
Commentary by: Thomas J. Barrack Jr.
OCTOBER 22, 2016, 9:00 AM EDT
DAMASCUS, SYRIA. MARCH 13, 2016. People in a Damascus neighborhood, an area liberated when a
ceasefire agreement between the Syrian Army and the rebels controlling the district came into effect on

For decades, the U.S. has pursued misguided policies.
At pivotal moments in our history, America has courageously
concluded that a central tenet of its foreign policy, conceived with the
best intentions, simply isn’t working. Hard though it’s been for this
proud and mighty nation to admit failure, trading a losing strategy for
a fresh course has brought such triumphs as the Nixon-Kissinger pacts
with China that isolated the Soviet Union and helped to end the Cold
War.
Today, America faces just such a reckoning in the Middle East. Our
objective is clear: halting the spread of terrorism that’s headed for our
shores, threatening mass murder in our suburban shopping malls, city
tunnels, and crowded parks. With the Middle East in chaos—as though
a raging desert sirocco is destroying all sense of order––the US should
make a radical, historic shift in its outreach towards the Arab world.
Given the reluctance of America and its Western allies to launch a
military offensive, it’s impossible to know when peace will be restored.
But right now, while the battles rage, the US can take decisive
diplomatic steps to stem the poverty and despair that makes the
Middle East a breeding ground for radical Islamic terrorism. America
should forge alliances with a new generation of Arab leaders whose
principal goal is improving the daily lives of their people. Providing
jobs and raising hope among the region’s impoverished youth is the
best protection for the world’s wealthy nations, from America, to
Europe, to the Arabian Peninsula.
Once peace is restored, the US should take the lead in establishing a
21st century “Marshall Plan” of economic aid to durably lift living
standards in the Middle East’s poorest areas.
So what went wrong? For decades, the U.S. has pursued a misguided
policy I’ll call “embrace and abandon.” It started with the “embrace:”
recruiting and financing leaders who were blatantly autocratic, yet at
the time qualified as America’s allies. Then, the U.S. invariably
exhorted these strongmen to champion revolutionary democratic
reforms in the name of “nation building.” Yet the newly-installed
regimes owed their existence to denying freedoms that would rally
dissidents to overthrow them. So the democratization America
encouraged was doomed from the start.
Then came the “abandon.” Time and time again, when the
governments America had nurtured and praised faced resistance or
rebellion, Washington deserted their leaders, citing the popular excuse
that their repressive measures were enslaving their own people.
Supporting leaders when they kept the Middle East stable, then
dumping them when they failed to adopt Western ideals, was a
blueprint for disaster. And it’s disaster that ensued. Many of those
strongmen––from Mubarak in Egypt to Gaddafi in Libya––have
fallen. Once dominated by repressive but stable nation-states, vast
swaths of the Middle East are now borderless, a hodge-podge of
territories controlled by warring factions that’s a throwback to its
tribal past.
The search for a solution to this chaos requires a clear understanding
of how we got here in the first place.
For centuries, the Ottoman Empire had neutralized the historically
rooted sectarian divisions within Islam. Those divisions stem from its
ancient political legacy as a “caliphate,” a religious state with united by
military might, but with constantly shifting borders. Following the
Ottoman collapse after World War I, European colonial powers
assumed the role of regional administrator, and colluded to redraw
boundaries (i.e. Sykes-Picot) in the Middle-East to create nation states
that satisfied competing Western interests. Those newly-created
nations, occupying territories defined by legal borders, ignored Arab
history and tribal custom. Modern Western notions of distinct nations
bound together by geography, language, self-determination or political
ideals been relevant in the Arab world. To Arabs, tribe and religion
always trump an imposed political structure, especially the Westernexported
concept of the nation-state.
Following World War II, as European colonialism waned, the US
assumed a more significant role in the Middle East. US foreign policy
was driven primarily by oil interests, the protection of Israel and
resistance to Soviet aggression. To prevent the region from dissolving
in sectarian conflict, the US established a series of autocracies. The
campaign included restoring the Shah of Iran to the throne after the
democratically elected Mosaddegh regime nationalized oil fields, and
supporting for the Baathist overthrow of the Qasim government in
Iraq, which gave rise to Saddam Hussein.
Following the end of the Cold War, America’s foreign policy gravitated
toward nation building, and the widespread promotion of democracy
and human rights abroad. However, an iron fisted policies the
strongmen imposed to remain in power conflicted with the moral
endeavor to curate democracy afar. Hence, America’s crusade
undermined its original goals by threatening the same autocratic
regimes the US had helped establish.
As the leaders the West once championed are toppled one by one, the
boot-prints of Western Power are clearly visible. Regimes once
supported by the US have fallen, marking the failure of embrace and
abandon. In Egypt, Mubarak was in, then deserted. In Iraq, Hussein
was in, then deposed. In Libya, Gaddafi was in, then overthrown with
US support. In Syria with Assad, it was the same scenario. The
instability created by contradictory Western interests has invited far
worse atrocities by the new regimes than the crimes perpetrated by the
previous order. The massacres in Syria and Iraq are obvious, bitter
examples.
Filling the void are a multitude of warring sectarian groups from ISIS
to Syrian rebels. The factions each generally fight under their own flag
of political Islam. The rise of Islamic factions battling for territory is a
legacy of the Iranian revolution that established a state rooted in
religion.
Now, nearly four decades old, the Revolutionary Guard’s rise to power
remains the catalyst for Islamic sectarian division today, releasing
forces of fury once confined first by Ottoman rule and then by US
dominance in the region. The threat to Arab nations and the West that
ensued is the same as that led by the Ottomans: the spread of a radical
Islamic caliphate based on religion, not country. In Iran, this is credo
is championed by the Revolutionary Guard and an Ayatollah who
lectures two billion Muslims that he is an infallible ruler directly
responsible to God. US diplomats are faced with an impossible
balancing act: limiting nuclear proliferation and, at the same time,
firmly standing against the religious intolerance fanning Islamic
terrorism.
The outbreak of these historically opposing forces, compounded by
declining oil prices, is heightening the ferment.
The Arab World’s best hope is the rise of a new generation in
government. In the UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, brilliant young
leaders are crafting forward-looking policies to effectively forge a new
Middle East. American foreign policy must persuade these bold
visionaries to lean West rather than East. This endeavor will not
simply benefit the nations they lead. It’s the most effective strategy to
safeguard America’s interests. By supporting their anti-terrorism
platforms abroad, America enhances its anti-terrorism policies at
home.
Like Asian rulers who launched the Tiger Economies of the mid to late
20th century, these new Arab leaders are searching for policies aimed
at economic and educational development. Those policies are designed
to reduce internal tensions and secure their countries’ rightful place in
a future dominated by global trade. The fate of America’s Middle
Eastern allies, as well as its own foreign policy interests, hinges on
these reform efforts. These leaders need and deserve active, engaged
US support. Yet America’s recent retreat from the region, following
clumsy attempts at nation building, has destabilized and discouraged
its allies.
Iran is supporting militias in Iraq, Syria and Yemen whose stated
purpose is to eradicate Israel. That threat may create what has been a
previously unthinkable alliance between our Gulf Cooperating Council
partners and Israel. It’s in the interest of all these allies, including
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Palestine, other GCC members, along with Israel,
to join forces. That alliance would provide a countervailing balance to
the Revolutionary Guard in Iran, the ISIS caliphate and the aggressive
aspiration of Turkey, which is further fueled by a renewed Russian
push.
The competition for a caliphate has more contestants than just Iran,
including ISIS, of course, as well as Turkey, and the Muslim
Brotherhood. As the US withdraws, Russia is taking its place as the
non-Arab power player in the Middle East. The chill in US-Russia
relations has left President Putin free to defy Washington. Without
predictable US-support, our allies may have only one direction to turn
as Russia capitalizes on every USA misstep in the region.
The emerging alliance between Putin and Turkey’s Erdogan has
evolved in perfect Kissingerian fashion; sovereign relationships can be
as ephemeral as their counterparties’ interests. And now that Russia
and Turkey seem to have a growing relationship, a counterbalancing
alignment needs to be crafted between the GCC and the Arab nations.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been our longest and strongest ally
and, to many Westerners’ amazement, it is impossible for the US to
move against any hostile Islamic group anywhere in the world without
Saudi support. Almost two billion Muslims look to Mecca and Medina
as their spiritual heartland and challenging any faction of Islam
without the support of its guardian, Saudi Arabia, would be foolhardy.
The Saudis are reliable defenders of the West’s diverse interests in the
region, and have been America’s principal ally in the Middle East for
more than seventy years. The confused notion that Saudi Arabia is
synonymous with radical Islam is falsely based on the Western notion
that “one size fits all.” Fundamentalists supporting the Islamic State in
the Kingdom violate the rule of law at home, and the Saudis’ strong
efforts to prevent the export of terrorism. Saudi senior leaders desire
good relations with the West and see the Islamic State and Jihadist
terrorism as threatening to their very rule. Through the safeguarding
of the Holy Cities of Mecca and Medina, which remain open to tens of
millions of foreign visitors and differing Islamic beliefs, the Kingdom
has a unique window into the actions and motivations of radical
fundamentalists who pass in and out of those always accessible cities.
By sharing that intelligence, the Saudis greatly enhance America’s
security.
Like it or not, the military option most unpopular with America’s
voters and politicians may be its best. Bashar Assad may well be our
only hope in fighting the various terrorist factions that are attempting
to form an ISIS state. If America agrees that putting boots on the
ground would be impractical and ineffective, then a self-governed
“Syria State” must be the entity that reaches settlements with the
various factions that are causing the mass migration of thousands of
Syrians to Europe, the USA and elsewhere. The only solution is one
that works with Russia and not against them. Our vacuum forced that
hand, because we are no longer the lonesome superpower shaping
Middle East foreign policy.
When the USA had a narrow set of interests during the Cold War era,
acting prudently in favor of well-defined and communicated
objectives, its actions were more effective. But as the objectives
changed, and America attempted to democratize autocracies, the
broadening of goals led to a corresponding weakening of results. A
clear direction in the Middle East is imperative, not just to enhance
Middle Eastern nation-state interests, but to protect US interests at
home, as well as abroad.
America’s nation-building exercise of the past twenty years was
founded on self-contradictions that have tarnished US foreign
credibility. The geopolitical framework for that policy has been
“embrace and abandon,” a formula that has caused frustration,
confusion and concern to America’s allies in the region and displaced
many millions of young refugees.
As America rethinks its interests in the Middle East, its primary
concern is the elimination of domestic terrorism. The path forward
replaces fear with hope and poverty with prosperity. Once security in
the Middle East is attained, including a negotiated peace between the
Israelis and the Palestinians, the USA must respond with an “endstate”
perspective to draw a comprehensive solution similar to the
Marshall Plan. Going from promoting then dumping dictators to
drawing a new manifesto for economic rebirth would mean that
finally, the America is finally doing right in teeming, oil-rich desert
lands where it did wrong for decades.

How Increasing Income Inequality Is Dampening
U.S. Economic Growth, And Possible Ways To
Change The Tide
The topic of income inequality and its effects has been the subject of countless analysis stretching back generations
and crossing geopolitical boundaries. Despite the tendency to speak about this issue in moral terms, the central
questions are economic ones: Would the U.S. economy be better off with a narrower income gap? And, if an unequal
distribution of income hinders growth, which solutions could do more harm than good, and which could make the
economic pie bigger for all?
Given the decades--indeed, centuries--of debate on this subject, it comes as no surprise that the answers are complex.
A degree of inequality is to be expected in any market economy. It can keep the economy functioning effectively,
incentivizing investment and expansion--but too much inequality can undermine growth.
Higher levels of income inequality increase political pressures, discouraging trade, investment, and hiring. Keynes first
showed that income inequality can lead affluent households (Americans included) to increase savings and decrease
consumption (1), while those with less means increase consumer borrowing to sustain consumption…until those
options run out. When these imbalances can no longer be sustained, we see a boom/bust cycle such as the one that
culminated in the Great Recession (2).
Aside from the extreme economic swings, such income imbalances tend to dampen social mobility and produce a
less-educated workforce that can't compete in a changing global economy. This diminishes future income prospects
and potential long-term growth, becoming entrenched as political repercussions extend the problems.
Alternatively, if we added another year of education to the American workforce from 2014 to 2019, in line with
education levels increasing at the rate of educational achievement seen from 1960 to 1965, U.S. potential GDP would
likely be $525 billion, or 2.4% higher in five years, than in the baseline. If education levels were increasing at the rate
they were 15 years ago, the level of potential GDP would be 1%, or $185 billion higher in five years.
Our review of the data, as well as a wealth of research on this matter, leads us to conclude that the current level of
income inequality in the U.S. is dampening GDP growth, at a time when the world's biggest economy is struggling to
recover from the Great Recession and the government is in need of funds to support an aging population.

Economic Research: How Increasing Income Inequality Is Dampening U.S. Economic Growth, And Possible Ways
To Change The Tide
Overview
• At extreme levels, income inequality can harm sustained economic growth over long periods. The U.S. is
approaching that threshold.
• Standard & Poor's sees extreme income inequality as a drag on long-run economic growth. We've reduced our
10-year U.S. growth forecast to a 2.5% rate. We expected 2.8% five years ago.
• With wages of a college graduate double that of a high school graduate, increasing educational attainment is
an effective way to bring income inequality back to healthy levels.
• It also helps the U.S economy. Over the next five years, if the American workforce completed just one more
year of school, the resulting productivity gains could add about $525 billion, or 2.4%, to the level of GDP,
relative to the baseline.
• A cautious approach to reducing inequality would benefit the economy, but extreme policy measures could
backfire.
We see a narrowing of the current income gap as beneficial to the economy. In addition to strengthening the quality of
economic expansions, bringing levels of income inequality under control would improve U.S. economic resilience in
the face of potential risks to growth. From a consumer perspective, benefits would extend across income levels,
boosting purchasing power among those in the middle and lower levels of the pay scale--while the richest Americans
would enjoy increased spending power in a sustained economic expansion. Policymakers should take care, however,
to avoid policies and practices that are either too heavy handed or foster an unchecked widening of the wealth gap.
Extreme approaches on either side would stunt GDP growth and lead to shorter, more fragile expansionary periods.
Is Income Inequality Increasing?
Several institutions, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the
Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), have published studies showing that
income inequality has been increasing for the past several decades (3). According to a 2011 review by the OECD, the
average income of the richest 10% of the population is nine times that of the poorest 10%--in other words, a ratio of
9-to-1. The U.S. ratio is much higher, at 14-to-1 (4). The U.S. Gini coefficient, after taxes, has increased by more than
20% from 1979--to 0.434 in 2010 (see chart 1).

Chart 1
Although a 2011 CBO report demonstrated that real net average U.S. household income grew 62% from 1979-2007,
household income growth was much more rapid at the higher end of the income scale than at the middle and lower
end. Revisiting the issue in 2013, the CBO showed that after-tax average income soared 15.1% for the top 1% from
2009 to 2010--but grew by less than 1% for the bottom 90% over the same time period, and fell for many income
groups (5). Additionally, although the Census Bureau estimates that real mean household income increased 0.2% in
2011 and 2012, it declined for all groups other than those in the top fifth of earners (6).
This concentration of household income follows a long period in which income concentration remained relatively flat.
Using U.S. tax returns, economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez found that income concentration dropped
dramatically following both World Wars and was roughly unchanged for the next few decades (7). It started climbing
again in 1975, reaching pre-World War I levels by 2000--and Saez later observed that U.S. income inequality has now
reached levels not seen since 1928 (8). In both cases, a similar pattern was in evidence--a boom in the financial sector,
over-leveraged lower-income households, a massive, systemic financial crash--and the two worst economic slumps in
U.S. history, the Great Depression and Great Recession, followed.

A few factors help explain the concentration within so-called market income, which consists of labor income (wages
and salaries, plus employer-paid benefits), capital income (excluding capital gains), business income, capital gains, and
other income--all before government taxes and transfers (see Glossary for full definition).
The first reason is relatively simple: All these sources of income are less evenly distributed now than a few decades
ago. In 1979, the bottom four-fifths of the income spectrum earned nearly 60% of total labor income, about 33% of
income from capital and business, and about 8% from capital gains. By 2007, the bottom four-fifths share of labor
income had dropped to less than 50%, income from capital and business had decreased to 20%, and capital gains fell
to about 5%. In other words, all sources of income were less evenly distributed in 2007 than in 1979 (9).
Some point to the superstar status effect, with professional athletes and movie actors enjoying astronomical
increases in earnings in the past few decades, helped by technological innovation that broadened their reach across
global markets and a winner take all phenomenon.
Another superstar is the super managers. Piketty argues that the primary reason for increased income inequality in
recent decades is the rise of the super managers in both the financial and nonfinancial sectors, finding that about 70%
of the increase in income going to the top 0.1% from 1979 to 2005 came from increasing pay for those professionals
(10). Other studies show that, since the 1990s, deregulation, corporate governance, and a greater reliance on equity
options in executive compensation contributed to the compensation gap (11).
Another explanation of market income concentration is technological innovation. This phenomenon boosted the value
of high-skill workers, enhancing their productivity and growth, while rendering some low-skill workers superfluous. As
automation and production efficiencies have reduced the need for labor in mid-level professional or service jobs,
wages have fallen, and occupations requiring a college degree typically offer double the salary of those requiring a high
school diploma or less.
Other arguments suggest international trade and increased immigration--as well as the decrease in unionization--may
also dampen wages of domestic workers. However, research on the trade effect has been inconclusive, while the
impact from increased immigration on domestic wages has been modest (see Adding Skilled Labor To America's
Melting Pot Would Heat Up U.S. Economic Growth, published March 19, 2014, on RatingsDirect) (12). Meanwhile,
some research has shown that the sharp decline in the unionization in the country, especially in the 1980s, has had a
small but measurable impact on the overall increase in inequality for men over the last few decades (13).
The juxtaposition of slow or stagnant federal minimum wage growth and soaring compensation at the higher end of
the labor income scale is another factor to consider. The minimum wage, which has held at $7.25 an hour since July
2009, has suffered a decline in purchasing power for almost half a century--peaking in 1968, when it was at $1.60, or
just shy of $11 in today's money.

Not Just The Fruits Of Our Labor
Though the share of income from labor and capital, excluding capital gains, has decreased, the share coming from
capital gains and business income has increased over time. In particular, inherited wealth has increased since the
World Wars and the Great Depression, as Thomas Piketty has shown (14), and with it the earnings from that wealth.
This trend is important because labor income tends to be distributed across income levels more evenly than capital
gains--so a shift in income composition can significantly affect inequality.
While labor income accounted for nearly three-fourths of market income from 1979-2007, that figure had dropped to
two-thirds by 2007. Capital income (excluding capital gains) is the next largest source, but even at its 1981 peak, it
represented only 14% of market income before falling to about 10% of total income in 2007. Conversely, income from
capital gains rose, doubling to approximately 8% of market income in 2007 from about 4% in 1979. Business income
and income from other sources (primarily private pensions) each accounted for about 7% of total income in 2007, up
from about 4% each.
In addition, capital income has become increasingly concentrated since the early 1990s--and, despite declines in 2001
and 2002, concentration spiked from 2003 through 2007, with more than 80% of the capital gains realized by the top
5% of earners going to the top 1% alone (15). Capital gains also have become increasingly concentrated and are tied
with business income as the most concentrated income source.
The Impact Of Government Policy
Government policies on taxation and government transfers, such as Social Security and Medicare, have done little to
reduce income inequality--and may have contributed to a further widening of the gap.
Because government transfers and federal taxes are progressive, the distribution of net household income (after
transfers and federal taxes) is more evenly balanced than the distribution of market income. That said, at the federal
level, the equalizing effect of transfers and taxes on household income was smaller in 2007 than it had been in 1979.
The CBO estimates that the dispersion of market income grew by about one-quarter from 1979-2007, but the
dispersion of after-tax income grew by about one-third (16). The distribution of after-tax income in 2010 became
slightly more even among different groups than before-tax income, though the dispersion of after-tax income in 2010
remained wider than in 1979 (see chart 2) (17).

Chart 2
While the size of transfer payments rose by a small amount from 1979-2010, the distribution of transfers shifted away
from households in the lower part of the income scale. The bottom 20% of households received only 36% of transfer
payments in 2010, after receiving 54% in 1979 (18). This was largely because of the growth in spending on programs
for the elderly (such as Social Security and Medicare), and benefits of these programs aren't limited to low-income
households. Benefits for other programs that largely benefit the poor were also reduced (19). In addition, tax
expenditures mostly benefit the affluent: Tax credits and tax deductions benefit those more at higher tax rates.
Changes in federal government tax policy have also exacerbated income inequality in recent decades (20). According
to the CBO, the average rate for each income group in 2012 was below the rate that prevailed for that group in the
1990s and most of the 2000s even with the increases in average federal tax rates in 2010 (21). Indeed, the federal
income tax rate for the top income earners fell to 35% in 2012 from 70% in 1979, while the government didn't reduce
the payroll tax rate until the temporary Payroll Tax Holiday of 2010 (22). Keep in mind that the payroll tax that funds
Social Security is levied on pay below a certain threshold ($117,000 this year). In practice, this means that those
earning less than the cap pay a higher rate of Social Security tax than those who earn more than the cap. So, the
composition of federal revenues has shifted away from progressive income taxes to less-progressive payroll taxes, and
income taxes have become slightly more concentrated at the higher end of the income scale.

Increasing income inequality also poses a risk to certain states' finances, given the correlation between income
inequality and revenue volatility in the slow growth after the Great Recession. According to Gabriel Petek, credit
analyst at Standard & Poor's, the volatility of tax revenue seems to be increasing despite the states' less-progressive tax
structures--suggesting that income inequality as a macroeconomic issue can translate to credit implications for states.
Undereducated Workers: Both Today's And Tomorrow's
Technological achievement has saved us time and reconfigured our daily routines, allowing us to focus on our own
skills and boosting productivity and growth. These advances are naturally disruptive in the beginning as workers
adjust; that disruption becomes alarming when people don't have the means to adapt, making a lasting impact on
career development.
Although the U.S. has been fairly quick to adapt in the past, today's workers have been left behind by technological
change. Indeed, while recent advances now require many workers to have graduated from college, the supply of
college-educated workers hasn't kept up with demand--and even the fraction of high school graduates has stopped
climbing.
This education gap is a main reason for the growing income divide, and it affects both wages and net worth. From a
wage perspective, occupations that typically require postsecondary education generally paid much higher median
wages ($57,770 in 2012)--more than double those occupations that typically require a high school diploma or less
($27,670 in 2012). Further, those with a bachelor's degree had a median net worth value nearly twice that of people
with a high-school diploma in 1998--climbing to almost 3.5 times greater by 2010 (see chart 3) (23). This difference is
even greater higher up the educational ladder.

Chart 3
Harvard professors Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz argue that, rather than technology picking up speed, the
reduced supply of educated workers is the key factor explaining the education gap, finding that between 1980 and
2005 the pace of the increase in educational attainment slowed dramatically. In 1980, Americans age 30 years or older
had 4.7 years more schooling on average than Americans in 1930--but Americans in 2005 had only 0.8 years more
schooling on average than Americans in 1980 (24). Based on this data, it would appear the problem isn't that
technology has leaped ahead--rather, the supply of educated workers has stalled.
The impact of income inequality on future generations of qualified workers is particularly disconcerting. Michael
Greenstone, Adam Looney, Jeremy Patashnik, and Muxin Yu (Hamilton Project-Brookings) examined the effect that
the income divide in the U.S. could have on the future upward mobility of the country's children (25). They found that
investments in education and skills, traits that increasingly decide job market success, are becoming more stratified by
family income, threatening the earning potential of the youngest Americans.
These researchers note that, although cognitive tests of ability show little difference between children of high- and
low-income parents in the first years of their lives, large and persistent differences start to appear before kindergarten
and widen throughout high school (26). Indeed, researchers have found that the gap in test results of children from
families at the 90th income percentile versus children of families at the 10th percentile has grown by about 40% over

the past 30 years (27).
Not surprisingly, these differences persist into college and beyond. While there is a 45% chance that a child born into a
poor family will remain there as an adult, chances of staying poor drops to 16% if that child finishes college (see chart
4). A child born into the bottom 20% will only have a 5% chance of reaching the top 20% of income earners as adults.
But that increases to 19% if they earn a college degree.
Chart 4
However, college graduation rates have stagnated for low-income students, in sharp contrast with strong gains for
wealthy students. While college graduation rates increased by about 4 percentage points between those born in the
early 1960s and those born in the early 1980s for the poorest households, the graduation rate for the wealthiest
households increased by almost 20 percentage points over the same period (28). These trends likely feed into the
income potential for kids as they grew older, with children of well-off families much more likely to stay well-off and the
children of poor families disproportionately likely to remain poor.
Given that education--particularly a college degree--is so important in a jobs market that increasingly demands a more
educated workforce, these trends are disturbing. The findings suggest that last generation's inequalities will extend into
the next generation, with diminished opportunities for upward social mobility. Moreover, the U.S. is losing the

potential addition to growth of a worker who has reached his or her full potential.
The pace of U.S. education is also falling behind its peers (see chart 5). Approximately 43% of Americans aged 25-34
had a college degree in 2011, compared with more than half of people the same age in Canada, Japan, and Korea.
Moreover, the proportion of degree holders among Americans aged 25-34 is virtually the same as that among those
55-64, meaning that graduation rates haven't changed much--a sharp contrast with the OECD average and a number of
other countries, where graduation rates have increased significantly. As today's U.S. educational attainment slips
behind other countries, the U.S.' ability to remain economically competitive in the international market is threatened.
Chart 5
What if, instead, we broke that cycle? What if the supply of educated workers picked up its pace, and, more or less,
kept up with technological changes? The U.S. has been no stranger to this in the past. In the early part of this century,
technological advancements were accompanied by an education boom (29). What would be the impact to the
economy and to people's pocketbooks if the U.S. workforce's pace of education were to reach rates of education seen
50 years ago? That was when the American workforce gained a year of education from 1960 to 1965, which is a bit
stronger than the period from 1950 to 1980, where they gained an average of about eight months of education every
five years (30). In this scenario, the U.S. would add another year of education to the American workforce. U.S.
potential GDP would likely be $525 billion, or 2.4% higher in five years than in the baseline (see chart 6). If education

levels were increasing at the rate they were 15 years ago, the level of potential GDP would be 1%, or $185 billion
higher in five years. A more educated workforce would benefit from higher wages. While the increased supply of
people with advanced degrees may initially slow wage gains for jobs requiring an advanced degree, a stronger
economy would help support higher incomes for all and help government budgets.
Chart 6
Historically, data at the state level support these results. States with a well-educated workforce are high-wage states. A
clear and strong correlation exists between the educational attainment of a state's workforce and median wages in the
state, with more educated individuals more likely to participate in the job market and earn more, and less likely to be
unemployed (31). The unemployment rate for people 25 years old and older with a college degree was 3.3% in June
2014, which is one-third of the unemployment rate of those with less than a high school degree.
Education is an investment in the health and livelihood of future generations, with greater parent education positively
correlated to a child's health, cognitive abilities, academic achievement, and future economic opportunities. Education
not only benefits workers today, but also children tomorrow.
With evidence indicating that a well-educated U.S. workforce is not just good for today's workers and their children but
also for the economy's potential long-term growth rate and government balance sheets, what do we need to do to get

there? This will likely require some investment in the human capital of the U.S. workforce, today and tomorrow. But
studies have indicated that the benefits greatly outweigh the costs. Researchers estimate that, depending on the exact
program, $1,000 in college aid results in a 3- to 6-percentage-point increase in college enrollment, with the total cost in
aid averaging $20,000 to $30,000 to send one student to college (32). Given a college graduate is expected to earn
about $30,000 more per year than a high school graduate over the course of their life, the benefits outweigh the costs.
It also this means more tax revenue from higher income than otherwise would have been the case.
Other new low-cost interventions, like simpler financial aid applications, more outreach about financial aid options that
are available to students from low-income households, as well as offering college mentors to students, could help send
more kids to school and encourage them to stay once they get there (33). Indeed, while the sticker price of a college
degree is high, according to the College Board in 2012, the actual price paid after financial aid is often lower. That may
be enough to encourage more low-income families to enroll.
While most agree that increasing college graduation rates would be a boon for economic growth, what about
education before college? Goldin and Katz argue that the U.S. had pioneered free and accessible elementary
education for most of its citizens and extended its lead into high school education when other countries were
introducing mass elementary school education (34). After World War II, U.S. universities were known to be the best in
the world. But by the early 1970s, Golden and Katz note that high school graduation rates plateaued and have been
relatively flat for more than three decades, and college graduation rates slid backwards. That educational slowdown is
likely the most important reason for increased education wage differentials since 1980 and is a major contributor to
income inequality today.
Even if the U.S. government offers financial aid for college, many high school graduates aren't prepared for the rigors
of university education. The 2003 Program for International Assessment (PISA), for one, showed U.S. 15-year-olds to
be substantially below the OECD average in mathematics literacy, problem solving, and scientific literacy (35).
Increasing aptitude in early education has been discussed in a number of studies. Most point to increasing the quality
of K-12 education to improve high school graduation rates and postsecondary education (36). Some have argued that
inadequate investments by states and local governments in education have weakened the ability of a state to develop,
grow, and attract businesses that offer high-skilled, high-wage jobs (37). The Brookings Institution has found that a
high-quality universal preschool program, costing about $59 billion, could add $2 trillion in annual U.S. GDP by 2080.
This additional growth would generate enough federal revenue to easily cover its costs several times over (38).
However, the authors note that it is difficult to win support for a short-term investment, like preschool programs, given
the long-term nature of its benefits to the economy.
Catching Up With The Joneses
As income inequality increased before the crisis, less affluent households took on more and more debt to keep up--or,
in this case, catch up--with the Joneses, first by purchasing a new home. Further, when home prices climbed, these
households were willing to borrow against their newfound equity--and financial institutions were increasingly willing to
help them do so, despite slow income growth. A number of economists have pointed to ways in which this trend may

Economic Research: How Increasing Income Inequality Is Dampening U.S. Economic Growth, And Possible Ways
To Change The Tide
have harmed the U.S. economy.
Professor of Public Policy at U.S. Berkeley Robert Reich argues that increased inequality has reduced overall aggregate
demand. He observes that high-income households have a lower marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of
income than other households, and they're currently holding a bigger slice of the economic pie. Research by
economists Atif Mian, Kamalesh Rao, and Amir Sufi backed that up, finding the MPC for households with an average
annual income of less than $35,000 to be three times larger than the MPC for households with average income over
$200,000 (39). Mian and Sufi also found that, as home values increased between 2002 and 2006, low-income
households very aggressively borrowed and spent (possibly borrowing on increased home equity)--while high-income
households were less responsive. Unsurprisingly, when housing wealth declined, the cutback on spending for
low-income households was twice as large as that for rich households (40).
Mian and Sufi further used ZIP codes to locate areas with disproportionately large numbers of subprime borrowers
(those with low incomes and credit ratings) and found that these ZIP codes experienced growth in borrowing between
2002 and 2005 that was more than twice as high as in ZIP codes with wealthy prime borrowers (41). They also found
that ZIP codes with lower income growth received more mortgage loans during that time period, supporting the notion
that government policy targeting low-income groups increased lending to the less well-off. After 2006, the subprime
ZIP codes experienced an increase in default rates three times that of prime ZIP codes.
Raghuram Rajan claims that, while high-income individuals saved, low-income individuals borrowed beyond their
means in order to sustain their consumption, and that this overleveraging, as a result of increased inequality, was a
significant cause of the financial crisis in 2008 (42). An IMF paper by Michael Kumhof and Romain Ranciere also
details the mechanisms that may have linked income distribution and financial excess and have suggested that these
same factors were likely at play in both the Great Depression and Great Recession (43).
Unfortunately, coming back from the Great Recession appears to be taking longer than many had hoped. With a
postrecession annual growth rate of 2.2%, our recovery is not even half the historical average annual growth of 4.6%
for other recoveries going back to 1959. This is not a complete surprise, given that financial crises are often followed
by prolonged recessions and a long bout of subpar growth--thanks in part to the deleveraging that comes as people try
to repair their finances.
Indeed, during the recession, the consumption-to-income ratio of the bottom 95% of earners fell sharply, as banks and
other lenders imposed tighter borrowing constraints, according to a study by Barry Z. Cynamon and Stephen M.
Fazzari (44). Though the consumption-to-income ratio of the top 5% rose, this increase was not enough to offset
inadequate demand coming from the bottom 95%. That makes sense. Between 2007 and 2010, the average U.S.
household lost 39.6%, or about 18 years' worth, of their net wealth in the three years when the recession started in
2007 to the early recovery in 2010. The middle class lost over 40% of their wealth in just three years, while the top
10% of income earners actually accumulated an additional 2% to their wealth (see chart 7). Corporations that have
been reluctant to invest or to cut prices to gain market share because of distorted incentives to seek short-term stock
market gains have also depressed demand, according to Andrew Smithers (45). These two factors go a long way to
explain why the recent recovery has been subpar in comparison with other postrecessionary periods.

Indeed, economist Robert E. Hall, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, laments that the years
since 2007 have been a macroeconomic disaster for the United States of an unprecedented magnitude since the Great
Depression, noting that U.S. economic output in 2013 was 13% below what the precrisis trend has predicted (46). He
is skeptical that a sudden surge in output will help the economy recover the ground it lost. Rather, a possible scenario
would be a gradual return to a precrisis growth rate, which leaves the U.S. permanently below the level of output that
precrisis trends had suggested.
Indeed, while Standard & Poor's is expecting the annual real growth rate to climb above the 3% mark in 2015. That
will be the first time since 2005 and comes after another year of subpar growth of just 2.0% expected for 2014. The
U.S. already has averaged a mere 1.4% over the last 10 years, through 2013. After expecting to see that long-awaited
burst of growth in 2014 of 3% at the beginning of the year, we have reduced our expectations for GDP growth back to
that 2% mark once again. We now expect the 10-year average annual growth to be about 2.5% though 2024. To put
that in perspective, five years ago, we forecasted the 10-year average annual growth rate to be 2.8%, with all yearly
rates much higher than the 2% mark.

Secular Stagnation
The Fed's expectation for long-run U.S. economic growth has drifted down even more than our forecasts. Five years
ago, the Fed expected to see the economy ambling along at a respectable 2.65% annual pace over the long run. By
June, the Fed's expectation for long-run growth in the U.S. had dropped to 2.2% (central tendency was 2.1% to 2.3%).
The IMF and CBO have also lowered their long-term growth projections. Last month, the IMF lowered its long-run
growth forecast for the U.S. to about 2% (47). The CBO now projects that real (inflation-adjusted) GDP will increase at
an average annual rate of 2.3% over the next 25 years, compared with 3.1% during 1970–2007.
Aside from the fact that there are different Federal Open Market Committee participants now than before, the Fed's
reasons for lowering its expectations for long-term growth are likely similar to concerns that the IMF and CBO raised,
including the effects of an aging population on the economy and more modest prospects for productivity growth. The
CBO also noted that in addition to the retirement of the baby-boom generation, the declining birth rates and leveling
off of increases in women's participation in the work force also helped slow the growth of the labor force.
In this light, former Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers has said that the U.S. may be mired in a period of
slow growth, marked by only marginal increases in the size of the workforce and small gains in productivity--what he
called secular stagnation (48). This refers to an economic era of persistently insufficient economic demand relative to
the aggregate saving of households and corporations. Here, the U.S. may be stuck in a long-run equilibrium where real
interest rates need to be negative to generate adequate demand. Without that, the U.S. slides into economic
stagnation. While specific causes of secular stagnation are still uncertain, possible reasons include slower population
growth, an aging population, globalization, and technological changes. An increasingly unequal distribution of income
and wealth is also cited as a contributing factor. Disparate income growth is important because those at the top of the
distribution have a higher savings rate. Since income that is put into savings is not spent, it undercuts the overall level
of economic activity that takes place. Mian and Sufi emphasize the role of income inequality and how recent years
seem to suggest the only way the economy is capable of generating faster economic growth is by being juiced with
more aggressive credit expansion, which does not last (49).
Unfortunately, the move toward low-paying jobs has continued unabated. In the past four years since the outset of the
U.S. economic recovery, job gains have come mainly in low-paying positions, according to the National Employment
Law Project, an advocacy group for low-income workers. While 22% of job losses during the recession were in
lower-wage industries, 44% of employment growth in the past four years has come in this group--meaning that, today,
lower-wage industries employ 1.85 million more Americans than before the downturn. And often these low-wage jobs
have less access to benefits, such as private health insurance, pensions, and paid leave, compared with their
higher-paying brethren (50). Considering the Bureau of Labor Statistics' forecasts that low-paying jobs will dominate
employment gains for the next decade, it seems clear that labor-income disparity will continue to widen.

Not Just A Problem For The Poor
Do societies inevitably face a choice between efficient production and the equitable distribution of income? According
to IMF economists Andrew Berg, Jonathan Ostry, and Jeromin Zettelmeyer, the answer is no. They argue that the
empirical literature on growth and inequality using long-run average growth may have missed how income distribution
is tied to abrupt ends in growth.
Their work examined growth over a long time horizon, between 1950 and 2006, focusing on the duration of growth
spells, and showed that there may be no trade-off between efficiency and equality (51). In fact, they posited that
equality could be an important component of sustained growth, observing that the level of inequality may be the key
difference between countries that enjoy extended, rapid expansion and those whose growth spurts quickly dissipate. In
short, promoting greater equality may also improve efficiency in the form of more sustainable long-run growth.
Of the number of variables associated with longer growth spells, income inequality's relationship with the duration of
growth spells was the strongest (see chart 8). They found that a 10% decrease in inequality (a change in the Gini
coefficient to 0.37 from 0.40) increases the expected length of a growth spell by 50%.

Meanwhile, the experiences of developing and emerging economies suggest that igniting growth is less difficult than
sustaining it (52). Even the poorest of countries have managed to expand their economies for several years--only for
growth to falter.
Berg and Ostry found that income inequality is the single most important factor in determining which countries can
sustain economic growth. Using the GINI coefficient--which ranges from 0 to 1.0--they measured the extent to which
economic growth falls as inequality rises. A country in which everyone earns exactly the same would have a score of 0,
while a society in which one person owned everything would have a score of 1.0. Berg and Ostry saw that a GINI
coefficient of higher than 0.45 could weigh on growth. Although correlation is not causation, we note that, based on
after-tax income, the U.S. economy scored 0.434 on the GINI scale in 2010, according to the CBO, placing it near that
threshold (53).
To be sure, it seems counterintuitive that inequality is associated with less-sustainable growth, since some inequality,
by providing incentives to effort and entrepreneurship, may be essential to a functioning market economy. But beyond
the risk that inequality may heighten the susceptibility of an economy to booms and busts, it may also spur political
instability--thus discouraging investment. Inequality may make it harder for governments to enact policies to
prevent--or soften--shocks, such as raising taxes or cutting public spending to avoid a debt crisis. The affluent may
exercise disproportionate influence on the political process, or the needs of the less affluent may grow so severe as to
make additional cuts to fiscal stabilizers that operate automatically in a downturn politically unviable.
Striking A Palatable Balance
The discussion about income inequality is hardly new, and contrary opinions abound. In his influential 1975 book
Equality and Efficiency: The Big Tradeoff, economist Arthur Okun argued that pursuing equality can reduce
efficiency. He claimed that not only would more equal income distribution reduce work and investment incentives, but
the efforts to redistribute wealth--through, for example, taxes and minimum wages--can themselves be costly (54).
Of course, income inequality in the U.S. was much less 40 years ago. Kristin Forbes found that, in the short- and
medium-terms over a few years, an increase in income inequality has a significant positive relationship with economic
expansion (55). But Forbes also found that the relationship was weakened (or could turn negative) when she increased
the length of the growth spells. And a World Bank study later found that the positive effect on growth was almost
exclusively reserved for the top end of the income distribution (56).
Income inequality can contribute to economic growth, and a degree of inequality is a necessary part of what keeps any
market economic engine operating on all cylinders. Indeed, a degree of inequality is to be expected in any market
economy, given differences in initial endowments (of wealth and ability), the differential market returns to
investments in human capital and entrepreneurial activities, and the effect of luck.
However, too much of the focus in the debate about inequality has been on the top earners, rather than on how to lift a
significant portion of the population out of poverty--which would be a good thing for the economy. And though
extreme inequality can impair economic growth, badly designed and implemented efforts to reverse this trend could
also undermine growth, hurting the very people such policies are meant to help (57).

Economic Research: How Increasing Income Inequality Is Dampening U.S. Economic Growth, And Possible Ways
To Change The Tide
There is no shortage of proposals for tackling extreme income inequality. President Obama has proposed an increase
in the hourly minimum wage to $10.10 from the current rate of $7.25, and the IMF recently called on lawmakers to
boost the wage (though it refrained from suggesting a specific level). Managing Director Christine Lagarde said that
doing so would help raise the incomes of millions of poor and working-class Americans and would be helpful from a
macroeconomic point of view (58).
An increase in the minimum wage would certainly carry with it short-term impacts, likely bringing 900,000 people
above the poverty line in the second half of 2016--and, according to the CBO, lifting wages for 24 million workers at
the next level above minimum wage. Fewer American households at or below the poverty line would also help bolster
government balance sheets and likely improve state and local credit conditions.
But raising the minimum wage is not without negative consequences. Reduced labor demands resulting from higher
wages could reduce potential hires by 500,000 jobs, according to CBO estimates (59). Further, while 49% of those
workers making the minimum wage are under age 25, the CATO Institute reports that, of older workers (the other half
of minimum wage earners), 29.2% live in poverty and 46.2% live near the poverty level, with family incomes less than
1.5 times the poverty line (60).
Apart from minimum wage discussions, a recent report from the OECD suggested that carried interest--the share of
profits that money managers take in from an investment or fund--should be taxed as regular income rather than as
returns on investment. Ian Ayres, professor of law at Yale, and Aaron S. Edlin, professor of law and economics at the
University of California, Berkley, proposed an automatic extra tax, the so-called Brandeis tax, on the income of the top
1% of earners that would limit the after-tax incomes relative to median household income (61).
Warren Buffett, the chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, who consistently ranks among the world's
wealthiest people, has long argued along similar lines. He claimed that his 2010 federal tax bill--income taxes and
payroll taxes--amounted to 17.4% of his taxable income (62). That, he wrote, was the lowest percentage of any of the
other 20 people in his office, whose tax burdens were between 33% and 41% and averaged 36%.
Meanwhile, two Democratic California legislators--Loni Hancock and Mark DeSaulnier--have proposed tying the
state's corporate income tax to the ratio of CEO-to-worker pay--a sliding scale in which a company's tax bill could
shrink along with the gap in pay between executives and workers. The change would trim a company's tax rate for any
corporation in which the chief executive makes less than a hundred times what the median worker earns.
Any clear-headed consideration of these options must recognize that heavy taxation--solely to reduce wage
inequality--could do more damage than good. While the IMF studies found that some redistribution appears benign,
extreme cases may have a direct negative effect on growth. Heavy taxation solely to equalize wages may reduce
incentives to work or hire more workers. A number of studies have indicated that losses from redistribution are likely
to be minimal when tax rates are low but rise steeply with the tax or subsidy rate (63).
IMF authors Ostry, Berg, and Tsangarides note that redistribution need not be inherently detrimental to growth, to the
degree that it involves reducing tax expenditures or loopholes that benefit the rich or as part of broader tax reforms
(such as higher inheritance taxes offset by lower taxes on labor income) (63). Moreover, redistribution can also occur
when taxes finance public investment, or spending on health and education disproportionately benefits the poor, which

help offset the growing divide in educational opportunities and outcomes, broadening the pathways for our future
leaders, to the benefit of all.
That said, some degree of rebalancing--along with spending in the areas of education, health care, and infrastructure,
for example--could help bring under control an income gap that, at its current level, threatens the stability of an
economy still struggling to recover. This could take the form of reallocating fiscal resources toward those with a
greater propensity to spend, or toward badly needed public resources like roads, ports, and transit. Further, policies
that foster job-rich recoveries may help make growth more sustainable, especially given that rising unemployment
correlates with rising income concentration. Additionally, effective investments in health and education promote
durable growth and equity, strengthening the labor force's capacity to cope with new technologies.
The challenge now is to find a path toward more sustainable growth, an essential part of which, in our view, is pulling
more Americans out of poverty and bolstering the purchasing power of the middle class. A rising tide lifts all
boats…but a lifeboat carrying a few, surrounded by many treading water, risks capsizing.

Glossary Of Relevant Terms
Market income
Based on CBO analysis, market income includes the following components:
• Labor income: cash wages and salaries (including 401(k) plans), employer-paid health insurance premiums, and the
employer's share of Social Security, Medicare, and federal unemployment insurance payroll taxes.
• Business income: net income from businesses and farms operated solely by their owners, partnership income, and
income from S corporations.
• Capital gains: profits realized from the sale of assets. Increases in the value of assets that have not been realized
through sales are not included in market income.
• Capital income (excluding capital gains): taxable and tax-exempt interest, dividends paid by corporations (excluding
S corporations), positive rental income, and corporate income taxes. The CBO assumes that corporate income taxes
are borne by owners of capital in proportion to their income from capital, so the corporate tax is included in
household income before taxes.
• Other income: retirement income for past services and any other sources of income.
Transfer income
Transfer income includes cash payments from Social Security, unemployment insurance, Supplemental Security
Income, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, veterans' benefits,
workers' compensation, and state and local government assistance programs, as well as the value of in-kind benefits,
including food stamps, school lunches and breakfasts, housing assistance, energy assistance, Medicare, Medicaid, and
the Children's Health Insurance Program (health benefits are measured as the fungible value, a Census Bureau
estimate of the value to recipients).

After-tax income
After-tax income is equal to market income plus transfer income minus federal taxes paid. In assessing the impact of
various taxes, individual income taxes are allocated directly to households paying those taxes. Social insurance, or
payroll, taxes are allocated to households paying those taxes directly or paying them indirectly through their
employers. Corporate income taxes are allocated to households according to their share of capital income. Federal
excise taxes are allocated to households according to their consumption of the taxed good or service.
Average tax rates are calculated by dividing federal taxes paid by the sum of market income and transfer income.
Negative tax rates result from refundable tax credits, such as the earned income and child tax credits, exceeding the
other taxes owed by people in an income group. (Refundable tax credits are not limited to the amount of income tax
owed before they are applied.)
The Gini Index
The Gini Index is a measure of income inequality based on the relationship between shares of income and shares of
the population. It is a value between 0 and 1.0, with 0 indicating complete equality and 1.0 indicating complete
inequality (in which one household receives all the income). A Gini Index that increases over time indicates rising
income dispersion.

Data from Berg, Ostry, and Zettelmeyer (2008).
Authors' calculations: The height of each factor represents the percentage change in a growth spell between 1950 and
2006 when the factor moves from the 50th percentile to the 60th percentile and all other factors are held constant.
Income distribution uses the Gini coefficient. The political institutions factor is based on an index from the Polity IV
Project database that ranges from +10 for the most open and democratic societies to –10 for the most closed and
autocratic. Trade openness measures the effect of changes in trade liberalization on year-to-year growth.
Exchange-rate competitiveness is calculated as the deviation of an exchange rate from purchasing power parity,
adjusted for per capita income.

(12) The globalization of the world economy may have affected the distribution of wage rates at home. The U.S. has
seen international trade and immigration increase in the past few decades, as well as an increase in the consumption of
imported goods. Theoretically, an increase in imported goods, at the expense of domestic goods produced by
lower-skilled workers, could hold down wages of domestic workers, though research on the subject has been
inconclusive. An increase in the supply of foreign-born workers could also put pressure on wages in those jobs. But,
here as well, the effects of foreign workers on wage rates have been modest. Indeed, research note that immigrant
workers largely complement, rather than substitute, native-born workers, and thus have little impact on wages, while
actually increasing overall growth.

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021354.txt,"In this hierarchy one member—the
human—had stepped beyond its
assigned place in the cosmic society and
now lived in an unwitting complacency,
ignoring the precarious finitude of a life
being pursued by a radical judgment:
“tis nothing but [God’s] hand that holds
you from falling into the fire every
moment: ’tis to be ascribed to nothing
else, that you did not go to hell the last
night; that you was suffered to awake
again in this world, after you closed your
eyes to sleep: And there is no other
reason to be given, why you have not
dropped into hell since you arose in the
morning, but that God’s hand has held
you up.”

Like his contemporaries, the
deists and religiously inclined scientists
such as Newton himself, Jonathan
Edwards assumed the “Newtonian world
machine,” operating with the
metronomic regularity of natural law.
Presupposing both the science and the
aristocratic social hierarchy of his day,
Edward introduced anthropomorphic
language to create a clash between this
harmonious order and the willful self-
interest of humans who dared to ignore
their proper rung on the ladder of
existence. As a preacher of penitence,
he carried his anthropomorphic imagery
to extravagant heights in order to induce
a reversal of behavior in a recalcitrant
town. The sermon effectively threatened
the people of Enfield with what
amounted to “metaphysical ostracism,”
an expulsion no less thoroughgoing than
the primordial ejection of Adam and Eve
from the garden. The palpable effect of
this imagery depended on the evocation
of the natural and social orders rising up
like, and yet unlike, an angry monarch to
crush rebels against the cosmic
commonwealth.

7 While consumption taxes like VAT can hit the poor (Democrats hate them), there is room for carve-outs on
groceries, etc. There will be pushback from Republicans who hate lack of visibility of VAT as well. Only person who can
pass this is Trump.

° Under BAT, the working class is arguably hit even worse than under VAT

) BAT would cause prices to go up at WMT and TGT (most of Trump’s supporters shop there)

) Retailers would raise prices but exporters won’t lower prices

fe) 5% VAT will result in a smaller average rise in prices (not entirely passed through), so less disruptive — would
need USD to strengthen only 3-4%

° Where does this leave us? Only Trump can cut through the logjam.

° Other anecdotes
) Regardless of your political preference, he thinks we all need Trump to succeed or the economy will get Bernie
Sanders or worse.

) Tillerson vs Kerry — Woo thinks Tillerson is actually working and getting things done, as opposed to Kerry who

just cared about the Nobel.

7 Thus sees zero risk of a trade war with China

7 NAFTA is really more about China, not Mexico - and will ultimately benefit Mexico. Renegotiating NAFTA will
remove the ability for Chinese exports to come in tariff-free through Mexico.

fe) Mnuchin and Cohn really know what they’re doing and Woo thinks they will get there on VAT / tax reform

e Cases for tax reform

de, US marginal tax rate = 35 % = highest among OECD = diminished returns to investment > solution = decrease
marginal tax rate

2. US taxed on global income vs. territorial like other major economies. Issue because 1) US companies hold over

$2t in capital overseas and 2) US companies acquiring smaller foreign companies to relocate headquarters
internationally > solution = shift to territorial tax system

3. US = only OECD country w/ no VAT which puts US produced goods at disadvantage. (VAT — producer of exported
goods get rebate while importers pay) > solution = create VAT

° Solutions have nothing to do with stimulus, will allow companies to take risk, invest, grow, and critical for global
growth for next 10 yrs

And from earlier presentations/calls:

1. He mentioned on our March 1* tax reform call that the US is the only country amongst OECD without a VAT.
BMW’s thus cost less in the US than in Germany, as foreign companies get a VAT rebate when they export. US
companies do not and they have to pay import tax. He views tax reform as very bullish for USD and yields (bearish for
bond prices) and thinks the market is underpricing this. His rationale for the bullish USD and higher yields story is that
tax reform encourages more money to come home to the US, adds US investment, evens the playing field for US
companies — all good for US growth longer term and bullish the dollar. He had wanted tax reform by the August recess
but then Senate would need to pass the bill by July, so they would need a bill to work with by May for the House to pass
it in May — which means they need a bill to work with by the end of March (running out of time!) BAT is the only really
controversial aspect holding back tax reform even though it’s a small part (2 paragraphs of the 50-page Ryan-Brady plan)
— still vague on details but he hoped they’re learning from their mistake of releasing a half-baked travel ban that
imploded after a week.

Warez Dudes

In which the Seventh Sense reveals a secret, dangerous architecture of connection.
1.

It was my second overseas trip. I blinked my eyes as dawn broke over Europe and
seeped inside the airplane. We began our descent into Amsterdam. | changed the
tapes inside my Walkman. Something a bit more upbeat seemed right. Peter Gabriel.
It was 1993. August.

Earlier that spring I’d heard about a plan for a giant summer computer hacking
conference that would be held outside Amsterdam. “Hacking at the End of the
Universe” it was to be called. | can’t recall now where | had picked up news of the
gathering, but it appealed to me immediately. I’d just moved to New York and had
been dipping into the city’s hacking scene. The “scene” was less a boiling, hip hive of
action than a group of computer amateurs, curious hangers on and early IT system
engineers who would gather in the grubby basement of the Citicorp Building on 53
Street and Lexington some days after work to discuss various techniques for
tricking digital systems of all types. Hacking didn't have a deeply nefarious
connotation in those days; it was seen by most of us as a natural, even a healthy
extension of an interest in computers. The Internet had about 10 million users at the
time. The idea that, two decades later, it would connect more than three billion
people or that it would put millions of dollars into the pockets of some of the people
gathering in that basement was honestly unthinkable.

The bible of the group was a thin, irregularly stapled, photocopied magazine
published out on Long Island by a guy who used the nom-de-hack of Emmanuel
Goldstein, the hero of George Orwell’s novel 1984. The magazine was called “2600:
The Hacker Quarterly” and it offered a compilation of ideas about how to fool
around with systems of all sorts, from Atari gaming consoles to door locks. The
name “2600” came from one of the earliest hacks any of us at those little meetings
knew about, a famous 1970’s trick that involved using an audio tone at exactly 2600
hertz (about the pitch of a truck’s backup warning) to force the backbone routing
switches of the AT&T phone system to give up access to an “operator mode” which
would let the phone hacker - they were called phreakers - make any sort of call for
free. The hack didn’t really offer much practical pleasure except a chance to make
free phone calls anywhere in the world. Once you'd mastered the trick you pretty
quickly discovered there wasn't really anyone in Bombay you wanted to call
anyhow.

The real appeal, the deeper joy of the game, was different: It was the sense of secret,
ecstatic access. A feeling of control in the largest network on earth. At one pointa
phreaker named John Draper figured out that the little plastic whistles stuffed as
children’s toys inside boxes of sugary Cap’n Crunch cereal produced the 2600 Hz
tone nearly perfectly. The hack made him a legend. He became known, inevitably, as

(Chinese/Japanese/Korean) segmenter was used to break characters into word units. The CJK
segmenter inserts spaces along common semantic boundaries. Hence, 1-grams that appear in the
Chinese simplified corpora will sometimes contain strings with 1 or more Chinese characters.

Given a sequence of n 1-grams, we denote the corresponding n-gram by concatenating the 1-grams with
a plain space character in between. A few examples of the tokenization and 1-gram construction method
are provided in Table $2.

Each book edition was broken down into a series of 1-grams on a page-by-page basis. For each page of
each book, we counted the number of times each 1-gram appeared. We further counted the number of
times each n-gram appeared (e.g., a sequence of n 1-grams) for all n less than or equal to 5. Because
this was done on a page-by-page basis, n-grams that span two consecutive pages were not counted.

by Vicky Ward <http://wwwvaniryfaircomkontributors/vicky-  ward> 
March 8,2011, 2:30 PM 
I've got a story idea for you. The rebuilding of Indonesia. Or New Orleans. Or both. Go there. I've just been. You will never 
think the same way about anything again. 
So spoke not Bill or Melinda Gates, but Ghislaine Maxwell, the 48-year-old woman being written up everywhere at the moment 
as the alleged procurer of young women for billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. 
Epstein, 57, is the financier who spent a year in jail on charges of soliciting prostitutes—and now there is talk of another 
investigation because various women, now in their twenties and thirties, have come forward with allegations that he molested 
them when they were under-age. The allegations first surfaced in British newspapers, which have zeroed in on Epstein's 
friendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tried to publicly disassociate himself from his old pal. 
I wrote a piece for Vanity Fair in 2003 called The Talented Mr. Epstein. It was largely a business piece that focused on his 
mysterious exit from Bear Stearns in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne, Les Wexner, the chairman of Limited 
Brands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude Hoffenberg, who is currently serving a 20-year-jail 
sentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of $450 million. 
The piece alluded to Epstein's great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women with whom he had 
sexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn't really go there, focusing instead on the issue that remains a mystery—how 
Jeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers. 
This is not to say I didn't hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I concentrated on the intriguing 
financial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same ones, different ones. And their stories are bone-
chilling. Journalists from England have phoned—and, in one case, flown—to ask me about Epstein and Maxwell. Who is he? 
And the British, especially, want to know: Who is she? At this point, I am so bored of repeating myself to others—it was, after all, 
my 2003 Vanity Fairstory that really brought him into the limelight—that I have decided to write about this myself. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 030420 
Bizarrely, perhaps, I have gotten to know Jeffrey and Ghislaine far better after my piece than before it. I kept running into both of 
them, separately, at parties. Jeffrey is not a social animal so he usually has a couple of young women with him who stand two feet 
behind him, as if serving a monarch. Do they speak? I remember asking him once, nodding at his lookalike blondes. He 
laughed. Not like you, Vicky, was his riposte. 
I remembered that when we'd once discussed math—in particular, an isosceles triangle—and I revealed I hadn't studied math 
since I was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I received a package at home via messenger. It was a 
book: Math for idiots. 
So he is not without humor, even though he doesn't drink or smoke, and hates restaurants. 
Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects, newspaper publisher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He was certainly 
preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few moments in his company and 
you know this to be true. 
When I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that Andy—as Jeffrey 
calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his strange title is. Because if one thing's 
for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what he's talking about far more than Andy does. Which is 
why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other financiers hang out with him. 
And Ghislaine? 
Full disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It's almost impossible not to. 
She is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I've spent hours talking to her about 
the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is curious. She has spent weeks at the bottom 
of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent me a DVD of the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away 
almost anyone else's I can think of—probably even Rupert Murdochs'. She is very well-read and can talk about most things for 
hours. She is passionate about Bill Clinton with whom she is close friends. 
Yet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-Platero, (known 
fondly to her close friends as the Tennis Goddess) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When it comes down to things she 
really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her vulnerability. 
And that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey. 
He saved her, I remember a close friend of mine telling me. When her father died, she was a wreck; inconsolable. And then 
Jeffrey took her in. She's never forgotten that—and never will. 
In many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect replacement for her 
father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his sexual pecadillos, but then Ghislaine's 
father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving a massive black hole he'd fraudulently created. To 
Ghislaine, Jeffrey's habits may not have seemed that strange. 
In fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful people in the end 
either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl issues, and moved countries to avoid 
paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You don't tend to get to the top by being the world's most 
balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett didn't quite manage a normal life—whatever that is. He had a second 
wife for many years whose existence he has been open about. 
So what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven't spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her loyalty to friends 
like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about as always. Look at Waksal and Stewart. No one 
sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up for all sorts of blemishes.

Mixed prospects for fiscal consolidation

The apparent redistribution of part of the proceeds of the flagship fiscal measures
towards funding the NTP initiatives suggests that the fiscal consolidation efforts could
fall short of the necessary requirement to narrow imbalances materially in the absence
of a sustained oil price recovery. We calculate that the NTP targets a total net
cumulative fiscal consolidation effort of SAR648bn (US$172.8bn) or c1% of GDP
annually, assuming progressive and full implementation of the non-oil revenue targets.

Energy policy needs to support economic transformation

Energy policy is likely to be less aggressive going forward, particularly as the NTP
suggests a constant oil production capacity as well as an increase in gas production
domestically which could free up domestic crude for exports. To remain consistent with
the targeted government debt accumulation path, we estimate that oil prices have to
average at least US$50/bbl in 2016-20 along with no growth in spending from 2016
levels (excluding the additional cost of NTP initiatives but including implementation of
the NTP non-oil revenue measures). Oil prices of at least cCUS$65/bbl would be required
if spending is not disciplined or revenue targets are missed by c50%, in our view.

Blueprint for fiscal measures lacks details

The approved NTP initiatives will have a total fiscal cost of SAR268bn (USS71.5bn;
11.6% of GDP) spread over five years (annually, SAR54bn equivalent to US$14.3bn or
2.3% of GDP). Government financing could represent 60% of total funding needs for the
NTP initiatives, with total NTP costs of SAR447bn (USS$119bn; 18.4% of GDP). Against
that, the NTP envisages raising SAR366bn in non-oil revenues and cut the wage bill by
5% or SAR24bn (USS$6.4bn or 1% of GDP). Non-oil revenue is seen rising to SAR530bn
(USS141bn, 23% of 2016f GDP) by 2020 from SAR163.5bn (7% of GDP).

Wage bill measure unclear but may carry profound social implications

In an unprecedented austerity measure, the share of the wage bill in total spending
would fall by 5ppt to 40% (SAR456bn, from SAR480bn) by 2020. It is yet unclear how
this could be achieved in practice. Furthermore, note that the MoF budget
announcement estimated the wage bill in 2015 to stand at SAR450bn, blurring the
target. Privatizations of government entities are likely to lead to a natural drop in the
public sector number of employees and wage bill. Yet we note that the Ministry of Civil
Service has two Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) directly linked to a decrease in the
payroll and benefits expenditure, and to a reduction in workers in the civil service sector.
This would likely be a contentious and unpopular measure to implement, and its
implementation and success appear challenging to us.

Palm Beach sex offender's secret plea deal:
Possible co-conspirators not charged, presses
victims to settle civil suits

By SUSAN SPENCER-WENDEL
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer
Friday, September 18, 2009

WEST PALM BEACH — Billionaire financier sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's secret non-prosecution agreement he
struck with federal prosecutors was unsealed Friday, offering the first public look at the deal Epstein's high-powered
legal counsel brokered on his behalf.

According the agreement, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Attorney's Office investigated Epstein
for various federal crimes, including prostitution, some punishable by a minimum of 10 years up to life in prison

But federal prosecutors backed down and agreed to recall grand jury subpoeanas, if Epstein pleaded guilty to
prostitution-related felonies in state court, which he ultimately did. He received an 18-month jail sentence, of which
he served 13.

A former federal prosecutor of 15 years, Mark Johnson of Stuart, said the disparity in the potential sentences was
unusual.

The United States Attorney's Office also agreed not to charge any of Epstein's possible co-conspirators - Sarah
Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff and Nadia Marcinkova.

The agreement was negotiated in part by New York heavyweight criminal defense attorney Gerald Lefcourt.

On its first draft in September 2007, it required that Epstein pay an attorney - tapped by the U.S. Attorney's Office
and approved by Epstein - to represent some of the victims in civil suits they had filed against Epstein. That
attorney is prominent Miami lawyer Bob Josefsberg.

Former prosecutor Johnson said he has never seen a provision like that before.

But an addendum to the agreement signed the following month struck Epstein's duty to pay Josefsberg if he and the
victims did not accept a settlement and instead pursued litigation.

The agreement, signed by Assistant U.S. Attorney Maria Villafana, does not expressly state whether any victims
were contacted or consulted before the deal was made.

Attorney Brad Edwards of Fort Lauderdale, who represents three of the young women, believes that none of the
between 30 and 40 woman identified as victims in the federal investigation were told of the deal. Edwards said his
clients were still receiving letters in the mail months afterwards saying the U.S. Attorney's Office assuring them
Epstein would be prosecuted.

Never consulting the victims is probably the most outrageous aspect of it... Edwards said. It taught them that
someone with money can buy his way out of anything. It's outrageous and embarrassing for United States
Attorney's Office and the State Attorneys Office.”

Epstein now faces many civil lawsuits filed by the women, who are represented by a variety attorneys. In many, the
facts alleged are the same: that Epstein had a predilection for teenage girls, identified poor, vulnerable ones and
lured them to his home via other young women. The teens describe ascending a staircase lined with nude
photographs of young girls and to the spa room where Epstein would appear in a small towel.

Former Circuit Judge Bill Berger, who represents one of the victims, and The Palm Beach Post sought the
unsealing of the agreement. Berger refers to it as a sweetheart deal.”

Why was itso important for the government to make this deal? Berger asked rhetorically. We have not yet had
honest explanation by any public official as to why it was made .. and why the victim's were sold down the river.”

Former federal prosecutor Ryon McCabe described the agreement as very unorthodox. Such agreements, he said,
are usually reserved for corporations, not individuals.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014379.txt,"multiples due to lagging EPS growth. For our P/TBV valuation, we apply a 1.2x tangible
book multiple to BANCs 2Q17E tangible book below peer multiples due to lagging ROTE.
For our DCF analysis, we forecast net income growth stabilizes at 3% in the terminal
stage. We also assume a beta of 1.1x in the terminal stage.

Downside risks to our price objective are slower than expected loan growth, and a
reduction in the common dividend.

Bank of Hawaii Corp. (BOH)

We use an equal weighted three-factor valuation framework (P/E, P/TBV, DCF) to arrive
at our $75 PO and assign a 2.2x multiple to 2Q17E TBV, representing a premium to
peers, which we believe is appropriate given a stronger profitability and capital profile.
Our 17x multiple on 2017E EPS is equal to the the peer median given average EPS
growth relative to peers. Our DCF assumes a two-stage cost of capital of 9.8% anda
terminal growth rate of 3%.

Downside risks to our price objective are a longer-than-anticipated low rate
environment and a reversal of local economic improvement. Upside risks are a stronger-
than-expected economic rebound, better-than-expected capital distribution and a
shorter-than-anticipated low rate environment.

BankUnited, Inc. (BKU)

To arrive at our $37 price objective, we have employed an equal-weighted three factor
valuation methodology that incorporates target P/TBV, P/E and DCF. We have applied a
target P/TBV value multiple of 1.5x on our 2Q17E TBV and a P/E target multiple of 16x
‘17 EPS, based on BKU's above average growth relative to peers. Our DCF assumes a
two-stage cost of capital of 7.9% and 9.3% and a terminal growth rate of 6%.

Downside risks to our price objective are slower CRE loan growth on the back of
regulatory oversight, as well as an inability to deploy excess capital, increased
competition for Florida M&A and an inability to continue to implement an organic
growth strategy in New York City.

BB&T Corporation (BBT)

We use a three-factor valuation framework (P/E, P/TBV, DCF) to arrive at our $45 PO
and assign a 1.6x multiple to 2017E TBV and 14.5x multiple on 2017E EPS. We have
weighted the P/E and P/TBV factors equally at 40%, and our DCF analysis by 20%.

Our EPS multiple is in-line with BBT’s historical avg, which reflects very high-growth
years in the 1990s, a pace unlikely to be achieved near term given BBT’s size as well as
the challenging macro backdrop and industry headwinds. Our DCF assumes a two-stage
cost of capital of 9.7% and 10.9% and a terminal growth rate of 4%.

Risks to our price objective are macro risks such as a double dip recession, the
implementation of a strict liquidity coverage ratio and further regulation on overdraft
income that restricts bank profitability. Specific to BBT, risks are enhanced regulatory
scrutiny and capital standards as a Domestic SIFI, the announcement of a large,
expensive deal, and the risk that the NPBC transaction does not consummate.

Capital Bank Financial Corp. (CBF)

Our $38 PO is based on an equal-weighted, two-factor valuation methodology that
assumes: We assumes a 20.0x P/ 2017e EPS and a target P/TBV of 1.6x to 2017E
tangible book given our forecast above peer EPS growth.

Downside risks to our PO are an inability to deploy excess capital and create value
through acquisitions.

Government bonds - Key points

¢ We expected government bond yields to move towards slightly higher ranges over the next 6 months,
as seen in late 201 1/early 2012. This is likely to have a slightly negative effect on most developed
government bond prices, and is likely to result in a total return around zero over this period.

¢ Price fluctuations in the month ahead could originate from developments in the Eurozone and the US.
They include the Troika report on Greece, Spanish local elections/referendum and the possible delayed
request for additional ECB support in Europe. In the US, the extent of the fiscal cliff is dependent on the
election outcome and the results from the debates in the subsequent lame duck session of congress.
While we expect the full cliff to be avoided, it poses a significant downside risk to domestic growth.

* Overall, we suggest keeping the duration close to neutral, as we expect global growth to remain
lackluster and central banks to continue supporting bond markets.

Corporate and emerging market bonds - Key points

¢ We maintain a preference for investment-grade (IG) and US high-yield (HY) corporate credit. A strong
(US) corporate sector, the ongoing moderate recovery of the US economy, determined central bank
support and a strong technical backdrop are likely to further support credit segments.

e Investment-grade corporate bonds have achieved a total return of more than 10% so far this year, at
remarkably low volatility. While absolute returns will likely be moderate in the next six months (1-2%),
the asset class should continue outperforming government bonds, offering higher liquidity than HY
bonds. We see the highest return potential in the lower-rated IG segments (BBB and A).

e US corporate bonds of lower credit quality (HY) remain fundamentally supported by solid balance
sheets and a benign US growth outlook. Given the low risk of default losses, valuations are attractive at
an effective yield of above 6%. For US HY, we expect mid single-digit total returns in the next six months.
US senior loans are an attractive alternative to traditional fixed income assets.

e Emerging market (EM) bonds should continue to benefit from better fundamentals than those of
developed markets over the medium term. However, valuations have now moved towards a fair level for
sovereign bonds (in USD) and we take profits on selected sovereign bond issuers. For EM corporate bonds
in USD, there is still some potential for spreads to trend lower in the quarters ahead, and we continue to
recommend this area as a ClO-preferred theme.

2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *911

would cover such situations by allowing victims who are present at a hearing to be heard on issues directly affecting their
rights.

[#912]

Rule 44.1 - Discretionary Appointment of Counsel for Victim

The Proposal:

The court's discretionary authority to appoint counsel for a victim should be included in a new rule as follows:
Rule 44.1 Counsel for Victims.

When the interests of justice require, the court may appoint counsel for a victim to assist the victim in exercising his or her
rights.

The Rationale:

An argument could be made that the CVRA guarantees crime victims the right to appointed counsel. After all, the CVRA
guarantees victims the right to be treated with fairness and fairness can be understood as embracing the assistance of counsel.
309 But on closer examination, it becomes clear that nothing in the CVRA directly mandates counsel for victims. As Senator
Kyl explained, This bill does not provide victims with a right to counsel but recognizes that a victim may enlist counsel on
their own. 310

While the CVRA does not require judges to appomt counsel for victims, nothing in it prevents judges from doing so in
appropriate cases, particularly under prevailing case law demonstrating that federal courts have inherent authority to make such
appointments. Because this authority may not be well known to judges (or to victims), the authority should be clearly laid out
in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

A number of federal courts have recognized inherent judicial authority to appoint lawyers for indigent litigants in both civil and
criminal cases. 3!! While these cases do not directly involve [*913] appointment of counsel for crime victims, their principles

309 Cf. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 344 (1963) (discussing fairness to the defendant as a reason for recognizing a right to
appointed counsel).

310 150 Cong. Rec. S4268 (daily ed. Apr. 22, 2004) (statement of Sen. Kyl).

311 See, e.g., Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 73 (1932) (holding, in a capital case, that courts have the power to appoint counsel and that
attorneys are officers of the court, and are bound to render service when required by such an appointment); United States v. Bertoli, 994
F.2d 1002, 1015-18 (3d Cir. 1993) (holding that the court has inherent power to order defendant's retained law firm to remain as standby
counsel at a criminal trial when defendant elects to represent himself pro se); United States v. Accetturo, 842 F.2d 1408, 1412-16 (3d Cir.
1988) (holding that courts have inherent power to appoint counsel during a criminal trial proceeding but that the power does not extend to
appointing lawyers licensed in other states); United States v. Bowe, 698 F.2d 560, 566-67 (2d Cir. 1983) (noting that a court has inherent
authority to appoint counsel for an indigent witness who may incriminate herself during testimony in a criminal case); Williamson _v.
Vardeman, 674 F.2d 121], 1212-16 (8th Cir. 1982) (upholding a state court judge's appointment of pro bono counsel in criminal case as
constitutional although noting that forcing an attorney to advance his own funds may be unconstitutional); 7vler v. Lark, 472 F.2d 1077, 1079
(8th Cir. 1973) (noting that in civil rights cases, representation of indigents upon court order has been a traditional obligation of the lawyer
which he assumes when he becomes a member of the bar); Dolan v. United States, 351 F.2d 671, 672 (5th Cir. 1965) (holding, in a criminal
case, that lawyers implicitly consent to be appointed by courts pro bono when accepting a license to practice law); United States v. Dillon,
346 F.2d 633, 635-36 (9th Cir. 1965) (holding, in a criminal case, that there is an obligation on the part of the legal profession to represent
indigents upon court order, without compensation). But cf. Colbert v. Rickmon, 747 F. Supp. 518, 527 (W.D. Ark. 1990) (holding that courts
have no inherent power to order attorneys to represent indigent clients). See generally Jerry L. Anderson, Court-Appointed Counsel: The
Constitutionality of Uncompensated Conscription, 3 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 503 (1989) (discussing the trend against requiring lawyers to take
uncompensated court appointments); Bruce Andrew Green, Court Appointment of Attorneys in Civil Cases: The Constitutionality of
Uncompensated Legal Assistance, 81 Colum. L. Rev. 366 (1981) (discussing the constitutionality of pro bono court appointments); Judy E.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027990.txt,"Youssef’s apartment, the one Mookie and Yoni had been assigned. Then, bursts
of gunfire from the other building.

A Land Rover was approaching from the gendarmerie at the bottom of the
road. We waited until it was about 50 feet away. Amiram and I opened fire, then
Dov and Shmuel Katz as well. The driver lost control and crashed into the side
of the Renault. There were at least four policemen inside. They, too, rolled
behind the wall on the far side of the street. Using the terrace columns for cover,
we kept shooting. Within a minute or so, only a couple of the cops fired back.

Though the three Palestinians could not know the reason for the gunfire and
the wailing of the car horn, they were now on their guard. When Mookie had
blown open the door to Abu Youssef’s flat — and he, Yoni and the other two
members of his team ran into the apartment — he saw the Black September man
peering out from the bedroom. Mookie raised his Uzi but the Palestinian ducked
inside and shut the door. All four of them fired through through the door. When
they went in, they found not only Abu Youssef but his wife, both dead. When
Zvika’s team burst in on Kamal Nasser, he, too, was ready. Crouching behind a
desk, he raised an automatic pistol and fired, grazing one of the team on the leg.
But in a burst of Uzi bullets, he, too, was killed.

I suspect that Amitai’s face-to-face meeting with Dado may have saved his
life. When he and his team cornered Kamal Adwan, he had an AK-47 raised and
ready to fire. Without even a split second’s unconscious hesitation, Amitai fired
first. His only regret afterwards was that Adwan’s wife and children saw it
happen, and that when they’d blasted open the apartment door, the force blew
open the door of a nearby flat, killing an elderly Italian woman. She had been
one of the Mossad’s sources of information on the Beirut apartments.

Mookie’s team came down first. They joined us, crouching behind the
columns, as sporadic shots continued from one of the policemen behind the wall
across the street. When a second police Land Rover approached, | at first
signaled the others to let it pass. But when it suddenly accelerated toward us, we
opened fire. It swerved, crashing into the rear bumper of the other one.

The other teams were back down now. I shouted for Dov to have the drivers
bring the station wagons from around the corner. When we began to pull away,
a third police Land Rover appeared. It sped up behind us. Mookie tossed back a
grenade. The last thing I saw as we made it to the end of the block and headed
toward the seafront was the front end of the vehicle exploding. We dropped
hollow, needle-sharp spikes out the window of the car as we left, so I knew that

and regain its full rights. Egypt's new government has made tentative
steps in that direction: Members of the Supreme Council of the
Armed Forces, accompanied by the deputy interior minister and
members of the military intelligence, held a meeting on Aug. 20 in
the el-Arish military club, in a conference hall with Bedouin sheikhs
representing each tribe in Sinai. At the meeting speakers from both
sides expressed their willingness to cooperate in bringing the security
situation back to normal and to bury the hatchet for love of Sinai.
The government officials announced their concessions, including
promises to soon issue a new law regarding land ownership in the
region and to revisit the files of those Bedouins sentenced in absentia;
the Bedouins dutifully clapped at the news. Several Bedouin sheikhs
subsequently took to the podium and announced their intentions to
assist in securing the region.

The government's planned reforms are a good start, but after years of
neglect, it's going to take more than promises to win over the
Bedouins. If Egypt is truly concerned about securing Sinai, it must
quickly turn its words into actions.

Over tea in his town house, she noticed, Epstein ate all the
finger food that had been put out for both of them. She found it

odd that the only book this supposedly brilliant man had left for

her to see was a paperback by the Marquis de Sade. And then

there was the call afterward from one of Epstein’s assistants — a
woman Ward did not know —who told her, “Jeffrey wanted me
to tell you that you looked so pretty.”

Ward is pretty, with fine English features and flowing blond

hair. She was also very pregnant then, with a bad case of morn-

ing sickness. She threw up often, sometimes in public, and these
clumsy advances on Epstein’s part only added to her ever-present
nausea. For a man who was supposedly brilliant, he'd struck her,

oddly, as not very smart.
“Epstein is charming, but he doesn’t let the charm slip into

his eyes,” she wrote. “They are steely and calculating, giving
some hint at the steady whir of machinery running behind them.
‘Let’s play chess, he said to me, after refusing to give an inter-

or what his arsenal actually consists of. He has carefully engi-

though repressive of political rights, have adhered to his grand
strategy of seeking natural resources anywhere in the world, wherever
they can find them, caring not with which despots they do business,
in order to continue to raise the economic status of their own people.
These Chinese autocrats govern in a collegial fashion, number many
an engineer and technocrat among them, and observe strict retirement
ages: this is all a far cry from the king of Saudi Arabia and the
deposed leader of Egypt, sleepy octogenarians both, whose skills for
creating modern middle-class societies are for the most part
nonexistent.

Park Chung Hee, in the 1960s and 1970s, literally built,
institutionalized and industrialized the South Korean state. It was
Park Chung Hee’s benign authoritarianism, as much as the
democracy that eventually followed him, that accounts for the
political-economic powerhouse that is today’s South Korea.

Then, of course, there is the founder of current-day Singapore, Lee
Kuan Yew. In 1959, Lee became prime minister of what was then a
British colony. He retired from that post over thirty years later
(though he continued to exert significant power until very recently).
As the British prepared to withdraw in the 1960s, Lee attached
Singapore to Malaya, helping to form Malaysia as a bulwark against
Indonesian expansionism. When racial tensions between ethnic
Malays in the Malay Peninsula and ethnic Chinese in Singapore
made the new federation unworkable, Lee seceded and the
independent city-state of Singapore was born. When Lee assumed
power, Singapore was literally a third-world malarial hellhole beset
by ethnic tensions and communist tendencies; it was barely a country
in any psychological sense and it certainly could not defend itself
against powerful neighbors. Lee turned it into a first-world
technological dynamo and transportation hub, with one of the highest
living standards worldwide, and with a military that is among the best

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS AS TO DEFENDANT JEFFREY EPSTEIN
4. Plaintiff Jean-Luc Brunel is the owner of Plaintiff modeling agency known as “MC2
Model & Talent Miami” (‘MC2”). MC2 began operations in October 2005 and has offices in
New York, Miami, and Tel Aviv.
5. Defendant Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”) is a hedge-fund manager with a residence in Palm
Beach County, Florida. Defendant has been the subject of significant media coverage due to

charges brought against him involving sexual contact with minors. (Composite Exhibit A

attached).

6. Plaintiff Brunel and Epstein have known one another since the inception of Plaintiff
MC2.

Ts Plaintiff Brunel operated his modeling agency, Plaintiff MC2, without incident until

Epstein was first charged in Palm Beach County with unlawful sexual contact with a minor in
2006. He was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor and sentenced to eighteen

months in prison, of which he served thirteen months. He remains a registered sex offender in
Florida as of this day.

8. First, after the initial criminal charges against Epstein were filed in Palm Beach County,
Plaintiffs were widely implicated in the media as being “linked” to Epstein. These false stories
caused both Plaintiffs a tremendous loss of business.

a. Plaintiffs lost multiple contacts and business in the modeling business as a direct result of

Epstein’s illegal actions. For example, several photographers will not work with MC2 due to the

United States District Court
Southern District of New York
VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE,
Plaintiff,
CASE NO:
v.
ALAN DERSHOWITZ,
Defendant.
________________________ /
COMPLAINT
Boies Schiller Flexner LLP
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 2 of 28
Plaintiff, VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE, formerly known as Virginia Roberts (“Roberts”), for
her Complaint against Defendant, Alan Dershowitz (“Dershowitz”) avers upon personal
knowledge as to her own acts and status and upon information and belief and to all other matters:
NATURE OF THE ACTION
1. This suit arises out of Defendant’s defamatory statements of and concerning
Plaintiff.
2. During 2000-2002, beginning when Plaintiff was 16, Plaintiff was the victim of
sex trafficking and abuse by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
3. Epstein’s trafficking scheme involved recruiting young girls, often by claiming
they would be paid $200 for simply providing a massage to a wealthy billionaire. The young girl
would then be brought up to Epstein’s bedroom where Epstein would be on a massage table;
Epstein would then sexually abuse the girl. This same pattern was repeated numerous times with
numerous children.
4. “From between 1999 – 2007, Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused more than 30 minor
girls…in his mansion in Palm Beach Florida, and elsewhere in the United States and overseas…
In addition to his own sexual abuse of the victims, Epstein directed other persons to abuse the
girls sexually. Epstein used paid employees to find and bring minor girls to him. Epstein
worked in concert with others to obtain minors not only for his sexual gratification, but also for
the sexual gratification of others.” United States District Court Judge Marra February 21, 2016
Summary Judgement Order at 2, Case No.: 9:08-cv-80786 (internal citations omitted). One of
the persons with whom Epstein acted in concert was Dershowitz.
5. Like other minor children who came before and after her, Plaintiff was initially
recruited to provide massages, and thereafter to engage in a variety of sexual acts, for Epstein.
2
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 3 of 28
Plaintiff was required to be on call for Epstein for sexual purposes and frequently traveled with
him both nationally and internationally. Plaintiff was regularly abused by Epstein and was lent
out by Epstein to others for sexual purposes.
6. Defendant Dershowitz was Epstein’s attorney, close friend, and co-conspirator.
Dershowitz was also a participant in sex trafficking, including as one of the men to whom
Epstein lent out Plaintiff for sex.
7. When Epstein was arrested for sex trafficking in 2006, Dershowitz defended his
friend and client by falsely attacking the veracity of his accusers, including calling the children
whom Epstein had abused (and, in the case of Plaintiff, the Defendant himself had also abused),
liars and prostitutes.
8. Despite his significant criminal activity, Epstein’s criminal charges were resolved
by a guilty plea to a single Florida state law charge and a non-prosecution agreement (a “NPA”)
with the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. Unknown to the public and the
victims at the time, Epstein’s lawyers, including Dershowitz, were pressuring the Government to
commit to the NPA without informing the victims. Epstein’s multiple victims, including
Roberts, were kept in the dark and told to be “patient” while Dershowitz participated in the
drafting of the NPA and worked to protect Epstein and other “potential co-conspirators”
(including himself) from prosecution.
9. On July 7, 2008, a challenge to the NPA was brought on behalf of two of
Epstein’s victims (not including Plaintiff) based on the fact that, contrary to the requirements of
the Criminal Victims’ Rights Act (the “CVRA”), the NPA had been concealed from Epstein’s
victims.
3
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 4 of 28
10. In December 2014, Roberts, who had not initially been part of the CVRA action,
was asked to, and did, provide information to Plaintiffs’ counsel in the CVRA case in which she
discussed her sex trafficking by Epstein. On December 31, 2014, Plaintiff’s counsel in the
CVRA proceeding (Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell) filed a Motion Pursuant to Rule 21 for
Joinder in the Action (“Joinder Motion”) on behalf of Roberts. Ms. Roberts’s joinder motion
described how she had been sexually trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein and was forced to have sex
with, among others, Alan Dershowitz.
11. Based on Plaintiff’s December 2014 filing, Dershowitz, as he had previously done
to Epstein’s victims, publically and viciously attacked plaintiff’s counsel in the CVRA actions,
Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell. Dershowitz, in nationally televised news interviews, wrongfully
claimed that Edwards and Cassell had engaged in unethical behavior warranting disbarment for
filing the Joinder Motion that described Dershowitz’s involvement with Epstein and Roberts.
Edwards, who is a prominent attorney for sexually abused women and children, and Cassell who
is a former United States District Court judge who left the bench to advocate for criminal
victims, sued Dershowitz for defamation. Edwards and Cassell asserted that the factual
allegations that Dershowitz had knowledge of and participated in Epstein’s criminal conduct
were entirely proper and well founded and that Dershowitz’s statements about Edwards and
Cassell were defamatory.
12. In April 2016 Dershowitz settled the Edwards and Cassell defamation claims
against him. As a condition of the settlement, Dershowitz required that the financial terms of the
settlement be kept confidential.
13. In November 2018, after conducting a lengthy investigation that involved
interviewing over eighty (80) women, the Miami Herald published the first in a series of articles
4
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 5 of 28
exposing how Epstein and his lawyers had corrupted the legal system to obtain the NPA and
referring to Dershowitz’s sexual abuse of Roberts. Dershowitz’s response on behalf of himself
and his client and co-conspirator Epstein has been a desperate barrage of false and increasingly
defamatory attacks on Roberts. The purpose and effect of these attacks has been to damage
Robert’s reputation and credibility and to try to intimidate her into silence.
14. Defendant’s central assertion is that Roberts has committed perjury, and that in
December 2014, Roberts and her attorneys hatched a scheme to falsely accuse Dershowitz of sex
trafficking as part of a criminal attempt to extort a settlement from another party.
15. As Defendant and Epstein well knew, Dershowitz’s assertion was false.
Dershowitz and Epstein knew that Dershowitz had in fact had sex with Plaintiff. Dershowitz and
Epstein also knew that Roberts’s assertions about Dershowitz were not part of any criminal
extortion plot. Indeed, Dershowitz and Epstein knew that Roberts had identified Dershowitz as a
sexual predator years before December 2014.
16. Defendant’s knowledge of the falsity of his attacks on Roberts have not, however,
limited the scope or scale of those attacks.
17. Examples of Dershowitz’s knowingly false and malicious defamatory statements
made on behalf of himself and Epstein are:
(a)
November 28, 2018: “the story was 100% flatly categorically made up” and
“Roberts and her attorneys fabricated the assertion in order to get money from other
powerful, wealthy people”. (Exhibit 1, p. 8).
(b)
December 1, 2018: “I never met Roberts; I never had sex with her; she
simply made up the entire story for money”. (Exhibit 2).
5
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 6 of 28
(c)
December 2, 2018: “I was ‘deliberately framed for financial reasons’”;
Roberts made her claims about Dershowitz “in order to obtain money from a
wealthy businessman and that Roberts had never previously included me among
the people with whom she claimed to have had sex”; “one of Roberts’ own lawyers
has acknowledged in front of witnesses that Roberts claims against me are ‘wrong’
‘simply wrong’”; “I never met Roberts; I never had sex with her; she simply made
up the entire story for money”. (Exhibit 3).
(d)
December 4, 2018: Plaintiff is a “certified, complete, total liar”; “I can prove
conclusively that she made the whole thing up”. At the same time Dershowitz
claimed “that the FBI recognized the evidence showed he was not where she said
he was”. (Exhibit 4).
(e)
December 5, 2018: “Roberts made up the accusations out of whole cloth in
order to obtain millions of dollars from Leslie Wexner” and “there is evidence that
directly proves I was framed. These include emails between Roberts and a
journalist, a book manuscript by Roberts and a legal brief that are smoking guns
showing that I was deliberately framed for financial reasons.” (Exhibit 5).
(f)
March 2, 2019: “My perjuring accusers are Virginia Roberts and Sarah
Ransome [who reported that Epstein lent her out to Dershowitz for sex at the same
time as Dershowitz was, at Epstein’s request, representing Ransome as her lawyer].
Both have long records of lying”. (Exhibit 6).
18. Dershowitz and Epstein knew Dershowitz’s assertions about Roberts, including
his assertions referenced in paragraph 17 above, were, and would be taken by persons who read
and heard them to be, specific statements of fact.
6
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 7 of 28
19. Dershowitz has repeatedly, publically claimed that he wanted to have a trial that
would determine the facts concerning his conduct. He said on national television that he would
waive the statute of limitations so that Roberts could sue him for sex abuse. However, when
Robert’s counsel asked Dershowitz to do so, Dershowitz refused -- and continues to refuse.
20. Similarly, when Dershowitz was faced with an actual case brought by Edwards
and Cassell which would have determined the veracity of Roberts’ claims, Dershowitz settled to
avoid that determination.
21. More recently, Dershowitz, perhaps believing that Roberts who is now living with
her husband and children in Australia would not be prepared to engage in litigation, has again
taken to claiming publically that he demands a trial on the question of whether Roberts
committed perjury and made up her statements about him for money. For example on March 2,
2019: My “accusers are Virginia Roberts and Sarah Ransome…I hereby accuse my false
accusers of committing the felony of perjury and challenge them to sue me for defamation.”
(Exhibit 6).
22. Mr. Dershowitz now has what he claims to have been looking for.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
23. This is an action for damages in an amount in excess of the minimum
jurisdictional limits of this Court.
24. This Court has jurisdiction over this dispute pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1332
(diversity jurisdiction) in that Roberts and Dershowitz are citizens of different states and the
amount in controversy exceeds seventy-five thousand ($75,000), exclusive of interest and costs.
25. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendant. Defendant resides in New
York City; Defendant conducts regular business in New York City; and this action arose,
7
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 8 of 28
defamatory statements were made, and abuse occurred, within the Southern District of New
York.
26. Venue is proper in this Court as (a) the cause of action arose within the
jurisdiction of this Court and (b) Defendant resides within this District.
PARTIES
27. Plaintiff is an individual who is a citizen of the State of Florida and a resident of
Australia.
28. Defendant Dershowitz is an individual who resides in the Southern District of
New York at 2 Tudor City Place Apt. 10EN, New York, New York 10017.
29. Jeffrey Epstein is an individual who resides in the Southern District of New York
at 9 East 71 st Street, New York, New York, 10021.
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
A. Epstein’s Sex Trafficking Enterprise
30. Plaintiff became a victim of sex trafficking and repeated sexual abuse after being
recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein when Plaintiff was under the age of
eighteen.
31. Between 2000 and 2002, Epstein sexually abused Roberts at numerous locations
including his mansions in West Palm Beach, Florida, New Mexico, the Virgin Islands, and this
District. Epstein also flew Roberts on his plane nationally and internationally numerous times
when she was under the age of 18. Only portions of the flight logs of Epstein’s private planes
are yet known, and Epstein also flew Roberts frequently on commercial airlines to meet him and
others. However, the chart below which shows Roberts’ flights on Epstein’s private plane from
the limited logs that are available illustrates the international scope of Epstein’s sex trafficking.
8
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 9 of 28
32. Between 1999 and 2007, with the assistance of numerous co-conspirators, Epstein
abused more than thirty (30) minor underage girls, a fact confirmed by state and federal law
enforcement.
33. After years of abuse, Epstein sent Roberts to Thailand in September 2002. One of
Roberts’ assignments from Epstein was to bring a young girl back to Epstein in the United
States. Fearing for her life, and not wanting to subject another young girl to the abuse she was
forced to endure, Roberts fled from Thailand to Australia to escape from Epstein.
B. Dershowitz’s Role with Epstein and Abuse of Plaintiff
34. Dershowitz has been “a close friend of Mr. Epstein” for many years. (Exhibit 7).
In 2003, Dershowitz said “I’m on my 20 th book… The only person outside of my immediate
family that I send drafts to is Jeffrey.” “The Talented Mr. Epstein.” Vanity Fair 2003. (Exhibit
8). Dershowitz also described Epstein as his friend “I would be interested in him [Epstein] as a
friend if we had hamburgers on the boardwalk in Coney Island and talked about his ideas.”
“Vanity Fair Reminds US When Jeffrey Epstein Wasn’t a Creep.” The Atlantic Wire. June 21,
2011. Dershowitz frequently traveled with Epstein, including on Epstein’s private plane. In
9
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 10 of 28
addition, Epstein’s employees have confirmed that Dershowitz visited Epstein’s Palm Beach and
New York City mansions often, would stay overnight, and was present when the victims of
Epstein’s sex trafficking were there. Dershowitz also visited Epstein’s other homes.
35. In addition to their close friendship, Dershowitz represented Epstein as his
attorney. On or about December 2, 2018, Dershowitz stated that he is still Epstein’s attorney
(Exhibit 9).
36. During the time period that Roberts was being trafficked by Epstein she was
forced to have sex with Alan Dershowitz. Roberts was forced to engage in sexual acts with
Dershowitz in, among other locations, Epstein’s mansion located at 9 East 71 st Street, New York,
New York 10021.
C. The Arrest and Prosecution of Epstein
37. Epstein ultimately pled guilty to procuring a minor for prostitution, and is now a
registered sex offender.
38. In September 2007, Epstein entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”)
in which the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida agreed not to prosecute Epstein
for numerous federal sex crimes committed in that District.
39. In the NPA, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida
additionally agreed that it would not institute any federal criminal charges against any potential
co-conspirators of Epstein.
40. Epstein flippantly referred to his sexual abuse of multiple minors, and the slap on
the wrist he had received for it, in a 2011 interview with the New York Post: “Billionaire pervert
Jeffrey Epstein is back in New York City – and making wisecracks about his just-ended jail stint
for having sex with an underage girl. ‘I am not a sexual predator, I’m an “offender,”’ the
10
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 11 of 28
financier told The Post yesterday. “‘It’s the difference between a murderer and a person who
steals a bagel,’ said Epstein.” February 25, 2011, New York Post “Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein:
I’m a Sex Offender Not A Predator”.
D. The Criminal Victims’ Rights Act Proceeding
41. Rather than confer with the victims about the NPA, the U.S. Attorney’s Office
and Epstein, who was represented by Dershowitz at that time, agreed to a “confidentiality”
provision in the Agreement barring its disclosure to anyone—including Epstein’s victims. As a
consequence, the victims were not told about the NPA.
42. On July 7, 2008, a young woman identified as Jane Doe No. 1, one of Jeffrey
Epstein’s victims (other than Roberts), filed a petition to enforce her rights under the Crime
Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”), 18 U.S.C. ¶ 3771, alleging that the Government failed to
provide her the rights promised in the CVRA with regard to the plea arrangement with Epstein.
43. On February 21, 2019, the Court found that the victims’ rights had been violated
and granted summary judgment in favor of the victims finding: “It was a material omission for
the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation
about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.” Order at 31. In its Order the Court
acknowledged that: “Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused more than 30 minor girls”. The Court also
found: “Among other provisions, the NPA expanded immunity to any ‘potential coconspirator’
of Epstein’s: ‘In consideration of Epstein’s agreement to plead guilty and to provide
compensation in the manner described above, if Epstein successfully fulfills all of the terms and
conditions of this agreement, the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal
charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to Sarah
Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff or Nadia Marcinkova… From the time the FBI began
11
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 12 of 28
investigating Epstein until September 24, 2007 – when the NPA was concluded – the Office
never conferred with the victims about a NPA or told the victims that such an agreement was
under consideration.” Order at 2, 8.
E. Victims Refuse Silence
44. Ultimately, as a mother and one of Epstein’s many victims, Roberts concluded
that she should speak out about her sexual abuse experiences in hopes of helping others who had
also suffered from sexual trafficking and abuse, and of possibly protecting future potential
victims.
45. On December 23, 2014, Roberts incorporated an organization called Victims
Refuse Silence, Inc., a Florida not-for-profit corporation.
46. Roberts intended Victims Refuse Silence to change and improve the fight against
sexual abuse and human trafficking. The goal of her organization was, and continues to be, to
help survivors surmount the shame, silence, and intimidation typically experienced by victims of
sexual abuse, and to help others to escape becoming victims of sex trafficking.
F. Defendant Acted Maliciously to Defame, Discredit, and Intimidate Roberts
47. Dershowitz made his false and defamatory statements as set forth above on behalf
of himself and on behalf of his co-conspirator and client Epstein, in the Southern District of New
York and elsewhere, in a deliberate effort to maliciously discredit Roberts and silence her efforts
to expose the sexual abuse she suffered. Dershowitz and Epstein did so with the purpose and
effect of having others repeat such false and defamatory statements and thereby further
damaged Roberts’s reputation. Dershowitz and Epstein knew Dershowitz’s statements were
false.
12
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 13 of 28
48. Dershowitz made his statements to discredit Roberts in concert with Epstein and
others, including Ghislaine Maxwell, one of Epstein’s long-time procurers, as part of a
conspiracy to discredit and try to silence Roberts. Epstein was particularly interested in
discrediting and silencing Roberts because he feared a reopening of a federal criminal
investigation of him.
49. Dershowitz made his statements pursuant to his conspiracy with Epstein and
Maxwell maliciously as part of an effort to conceal sex trafficking crimes committed around the
world by Epstein and other powerful persons.
50. Dershowitz and Epstein intended Dershowitz’s false and defamatory statements
set out above to be broadcast around the world and to intimidate and silence Roberts from
making further efforts to expose sex crimes committed by Epstein and other powerful persons,
including Dershowitz.
51. Dershowitz and Epstein intended their false statements to be specific statements
of fact. Dershowitz’s false statements were, as he and Epstein intended, broadcast around the
world and were reasonably understood by those who heard them to be specific factual claims by
Dershowitz that he had not had sex with Roberts, that Roberts was intentionally lying about
having sex with Dershowitz, that Roberts committed the crime of perjury, that Roberts had
committed the crime of extortion, and that Roberts had intentionally fabricated her assertions
about Dershowitz to extort money from others.
52. Epstein also worked with other of his attorneys to attack Roberts’ allegations,
including in a false statement they made in a letter to the editor to the New York Times asserting:
“The number of young women involved in the investigation has been vastly exaggerated, there
13
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 14 of 28
was no ‘international sex-trafficking operation’ and there was never evidence that Mr. Epstein
‘hosted sex parties’ at his home”. (Exhibit 10).
G. Dershowitz’s Lies
53. From the beginning, Dershowitz and Epstein have sought to hide their crimes
behind a curtain of lies. In response to Roberts’ description of Dershowitz’s participation in
Epstein’s sex trafficking, Dershowitz began a series of intentional, outright lies designed to
distance himself from Epstein, to cover up his own wrongdoing, and to discredit Roberts and
intimidate her into silence.
54. Dershowitz’s repeated lies are compelling evidence both of his lack of credibility
and his guilt. Only a person seeking to conceal improper conduct would have engaged in the
pattern of lies which has characterized Dershowitz’s statements since his sex trafficking was
revealed.
55. In attempt to conceal his relationship with Epstein, Dershowitz in January 2015
asserted that “my relationship with him was entirely professional. It is a total bum rap to say that
I…was ‘chummy’ with him”. (Exhibit 11). That was a lie, as Dershowitz and Epstein knew (see,
e.g., paragraphs 34-35).
56. Both to conceal Dershowitz’s relationship with Epstein, and to discredit Roberts,
Dershowitz has repeatedly asserted that he was only at Epstein’s residence once in Palm Beach,
and that was with his family. However, Juan Alessi, a long time Epstein household employee,
has confirmed that Dershowitz visited Epstein “pretty often. I would say at least four or five
times a year” and that he would “typically” stay two or three days. Similarly, Alfredo Rodriguez
who worked for Epstein approximately only six months confirmed that during that six months
period Dershowitz visited Epstein twice.
14
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 15 of 28
57. Again, both to conceal his relationship with Epstein and to discredit Roberts,
Dershowitz has repeatedly asserted that he was never in Epstein’s residence in the presence of
young women. As both Dershowitz and Epstein know, that assertion was also false. As Mr.
Rodriguez has confirmed, there were “also young ladies in the house at the time he [Dershowitz]
was there”. Mr. Rodriguez also confirmed that “Mr. Dershowitz was there” when “women came
to Mr. Epstein’s home to give a massage”. Mr. Rodriguez also confirmed that “Alan Dershowitz
was at the house” with “the local Palm Beach girls” who he was “told to call masseuses”,
although he did not himself know whether or not Dershowitz personally received a massage.
58. Maria Farmer was an employee of Epstein responsible for “manning the front
door at his New York mansion and keeping records of people who came to the home” (Exhibit
12, ¶ 2).
(a)
Ms. Farmer “witnessed a number of school age girls coming to the house,
some of the young girls would be wearing their school uniforms”…who “then
would be escorted upstairs” (Exhibit 12, ¶ 3).
(b)
Ms. Farmer was told these young girls “were interviewing for modeling
positions” even though “it did not seem credible to me that these young girls were
interviewing for modeling positions”. (Exhibit 12, ¶ 3).
59. Ms. Farmer asserts that “Alan Dershowitz was an individual who came to visit
Epstein at his New York mansion a number of times when I was working for Epstein.
Dershowitz was very comfortable at the home and would come in and walk upstairs. On a
number of occasions I witnessed Dershowitz at the NY mansion going upstairs at the same time
there were young girls under the age of 18 who were present upstairs in the house” (Exhibit 12, ¶
4).
15
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 16 of 28
60. Ms. Farmer, like other victims of, and witnesses to, Epstein and Dershowitz’s sex
trafficking and abuse has been subjected to attacks and intimidations. (Exhibit 12, ¶¶ 8-9). Her
courageous testimony, together with the sworn testimony of victims such as Sarah Ransome and
witnesses such as Mr. Alessi and Mr. Rodriguez , proves beyond any doubt that Dershowitz’s
claims that he was never present where Ms. Roberts was trafficked, and never in the presence of
young girls, are a lie intended to cover up his culpability.
61. Again both to conceal his relationship with Epstein and to discredit Roberts,
Dershowitz has repeatedly asserted that he has records that prove that it would have been
“impossible” for him to be with Roberts because he was never in the same place and time as
Roberts. As both Dershowitz and Epstein know, that too was a lie. The testimony of Epstein’s
household staff establishes that Dershowitz was repeatedly at Epstein’s residence. Even
Dershowitz’s own selected, incomplete, and apparently revised, records demonstrate that
Dershowitz was present at locations where Ms. Roberts was with Epstein.
62. Dershowitz’s assertion that Roberts accused him of having sex with her only after
her lawyers convinced her to do so in late 2014 is not only false, as both Dershowitz and Epstein
knew, but thoroughly disproved by the record.
63. Roberts had identified Dershowitz as a participant in her sexual abuse at the time
it occurred. She did so again in 2009. In 2010 Epstein’s co-conspirators were repeatedly asked
about Dershowitz. For example:
(a)
Adriana Ross refused to answer on Fifth Amendment grounds whether
“Alan Dershowitz stays at Jeffrey Epstein’s house…when underage minor
females have been in the bedroom with Jeffrey Epstein”.
16
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 17 of 28
(b)
Nadia Marcinkova refused to answer on Fifth Amendment grounds:
“Alan Dershowitz is also somebody that you also know to have been at the house
when L.M. was being sexually abused in Jeffrey Epstein’s bedroom, correct?”
64. In 2011 Counsel for Edwards wrote Dershowitz:
(a)
On August 23, 2011: “We…have reason to believe that you have
personally observed Jeffrey Epstein in the presence of underage females”.
(b)
On September 7, 2011: “Multiple individuals have placed you in the
presence of Jeffrey Epstein on multiple occasions and in various locations when
Jeffrey Epstein was in the company of underage females subsequently identified
as victims of Mr. Epstein’s criminal molestations.”
65. Dershowitz lied and stated that he had never flown on Jeffrey Epstein’s plane
with a young woman and always flew with his wife. (Hala Gorani, CNN Live, Jan. 5, 2015).
However, even the limited publically available flight logs of Jeffrey Epstein’s private plane
demonstrate that Dershowitz flew often on Epstein’s planes without his wife; with young
women, including a Victoria’s Secret model; Epstein’s procurer Ghislaine Maxwell; and Sarah
Kellen who was identified by the Government as Epstein’s co-conspirator in his sex trafficking.
66. Dershowitz also lied by saying that he “never” got a massage from anybody: “I
never got a massage from anybody. It’s made up out of whole cloth.” (NY Daily News, January
21, 2015). However, after it was revealed that Epstein’s household staff identified Dershowitz as
one of the recipients of “massages” at Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion, Dershowitz changed his
story and admitted he got a massage at Epstein’s Palm Beach home but claimed: “I kept my
underwear on during the massage.” (Local 10, January 22, 2015).
17
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 18 of 28
67. Dershowitz lied and said he never saw any naked pictures of females in Epstein’s
Palm Beach home during his many visits, yet the police footage that was obtained from the
search of Epstein’s home proves that there were naked pictures of females throughout the home
including in the common areas.
68. In a desperate attempt to deflect attention from his own misconduct, Dershowitz
fabricated an extortion plot by Roberts and her lawyers. Dershowitz falsely told the media that
he was being used as a pawn as part of a fanciful plan to extort money from a billionaire business
mogul and colleague of Epstein. Dershowitz’s claim was that he was framed in order to send a
message to the billionaire that this is what would happen to the billionaire if the billionaire did
not pay Roberts and her attorneys. As Dershowitz knew:
(a)
(b)
(c)
No complaint was ever made against the billionaire.
No money was either paid or demanded by or from the billionaire.
Roberts’ assertions about Dershowitz long predated the time of the alleged
extortion plot.
69. Dershowitz also falsely claimed that Roberts’ lawyer had told him that he had
concluded that Roberts was “wrong” and “simply wrong” in accusing Dershowitz. Dershowitz,
in violation of the canons of ethics and in at least one case in violation of state law, had
surreptitiously tape recorded confidential settlement negotiations he had engaged in with Ms.
Roberts’ lawyer. Dershowitz then played and described excerpts from those tapes out of context
to reporters to try to make it appear that Ms. Roberts’ lawyer’s hypothetical comments, and
characterizations of Dershowitz’s assertions, represented that lawyer’s conclusions. As the sworn
testimony (Exhibit 13) of Dershowitz’s own lawyer, and the facts set forth below, demonstrate,
Dershowitz’s assertions about what Ms. Roberts’ lawyer said are, again, false.
18
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 19 of 28
70. In May 2015 Dershowitz requested confidential settlement negotiations with Ms.
Roberts’ lawyers in which Dershowitz sought to convince Ms. Roberts lawyer that Ms. Roberts
was mistaken, and that the person to whom Epstein had lent Ms. Roberts was Nathan Myhrvold,
not Dershowitz. Dershowitz claimed that he had been at Epstein’s home only once (and that he
was there with his family); that he had never been in the vicinity of Epstein’s island; that he had
not been at Epstein’s New York mansion; and that he had been at Epstein’s New Mexico ranch
only once for a few hours (again with his family). Dershowitz provided a summary of his
whereabouts that purported to prove that his assertions were true.
71. Dershowitz was told that, based on what was shown in his summary, it would
have been impossible for Ms. Roberts’ assertions about him to be true, and that if his assertions
proved out, Ms. Roberts counsel would undertake to convince her that she must have made a
mistake.
(a)
Dershowitz was also told, however, (i) that his assertions would have to be
proven, (ii) that Ms. Roberts had always been very clear that she recalled having
had sex with Dershowitz multiple times, and (iii) that everyone was convinced
that Ms. Roberts was telling the truth as she recalled it.
(b)
Dershowitz responded that he did not doubt that Ms. Roberts was telling
the truth as she recalled it and that she would have no difficulty passing a lie
detector test. He said he simply believed Ms. Roberts had made an honest mistake
in confusing him with Nathan Myhrvold.
72. Following Dershowitz’ presentations, Dershowitz’s representations were
investigated and repeatedly proven false.
19
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 20 of 28
(a)
Dershowitz’s alleged backup for his travel summary proved to be
incomplete and in some instances apparently altered.
(b)
Dershowitz’s key claim that he had not stayed at Epstein’s house was
proven false, including by the testimony of Epstein’s household employees Juan
Alessi (see ¶ 56 above) and Alfredo Rodriguez (see ¶¶ 56-57 above) as well as the
testimony of Sarah Ransome (Exhibit 14) and Maria Farmer (Exhibit 12).
(c)
Dershowitz’s claim that Ms. Roberts confused him with Nathan Myhrvold
was tested by showing Ms. Roberts pictures of both. She was, and is, clear that it
was Dershowitz, not Myhrvold, with whom she had sex.
(d)
Dershowitz’s claim he had never been on Epstein’s plane without his wife
was proven false by plane logs.
(e)
Dershowitz’s claim that he had never seen pictures of young females at
Epstein’s house was proven false by Palm Beach police and FBI reports.
(f)
Dershowitz’s claim that he had never been in the presence of young
females was proven false by the testimony of Epstein’s household employer (see
¶¶56-57) and of young women themselves (see Exhibit 14 [Ransome] and Exhibit
12 [Farmer].)
73. After Dershowitz’s claimed proof of exonerating evidence collapsed, and the
evidence of his guilt grew, Roberts’ lawyer’s told Dershowitz in writing that they “had
discovered evidence inconsistent with some of [your] representations”, that his travel “records
were incomplete”, and that he “should have settled the case when he had a chance”.
74. Roberts’ lawyer explicitly told Dershowitz that neither Roberts nor her lawyer
would make any statement saying or implying that Roberts was mistaken in her charge that
20
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 21 of 28
Dershowitz participated in her sexual trafficking and abuse. In his public statements, Dershowitz
conspicuously omits any reference to the statements by Roberts’ lawyers after they had
investigated his representations and concluded that they were false.
75. Faced with the mounting evidence of his guilt, Dershowitz abandoned his attempt
to get Roberts or her lawyer to concede a mistake or that Roberts had been wrong, and
desperately sought even a suggestion that an error was “possible”.
76. In December 2015 Ms. Roberts’ counsel again told Mr. Dershowitz that “Virginia
is adamant about her current recollection” and that neither Ms. Roberts nor her counsel believed
she was mistaken in identifying Mr. Dershowitz as one of the men to whom Epstein had lent her
out for sex. In response, Mr. Dershowitz did not claim that Ms. Roberts lawyers had told him
that they did not believe her.
77. Instead, the morning of December 9, 2015, Mr. Dershowitz pleaded: “David,
Have we given up on a mutually acceptable statement from VR or you. Let’s keep trying. We are
not that far apart.” (Exhibit 15). When Ms. Roberts lawyer did not immediately respond, Mr.
Dershowitz wrote later the same day:
“We should be aiming at a short simple statement such as: “The
events at issue occurred approximately 15 years ago when I was a
teenager. Although I believed then and continued to believe that AD
was the person with whom I had sex, recent developments raise the
possibility that this may be a case of mistaken identification.”
(Exhibit 15).
Mr. Dershowitz went on to write: “It would be acceptable if the statement came from you rather
than her, if she prefers.” (Id.)
21
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 22 of 28
78. Wholly absent at this point was any assertion by Mr. Dershowitz that Ms. Roberts
was lying, or that she made up her charge as part of an extortion claim, or that after investigating
his alleged evidence Ms. Roberts’ lawyer did not believe her. On the contrary, Mr. Dershowitz
expressly recognized that Ms. Roberts’ belief was an honest one. All Mr. Dershowitz was
pleading for was an acknowledgement that there was a “possibility” that there “may be” a case of
mistaken identification. Even that plea was rejected by Ms. Roberts and her lawyers as
misleading.
79. Dershowitz’s present PR claim that Roberts’ lawyers disbelieved their client, and
that Roberts intentionally committed perjury as part of an extortion scheme, is just another
Dershowitz lie. His reliance on statements taken out of context, his failure to include the
statements of Roberts’ lawyer after Dershowitz’s supposed evidence had been investigated, and
the damning admissions of his own lawyers, reveal Dershowitz’s total lack of support for his
allegation that Roberts and her lawyers concocted knowingly false allegation against him as part
of a supposed extortion plot.
80. Dershowitz also lied to attempt to deflect Sarah Ransome’s revelations about him.
Ms. Ransome revealed that during the time she was a victim of Epstein’s sex trafficking,
Epstein’s arranged for his lawyer, Dershowitz, to also represent Ms. Ransome. Ms. Ransome
also described how, during the time Dershowitz was her lawyer, Epstein lent her out to
Dershowitz for sex. (Exhibit 14).
81. Dershowitz asserted that he never had sex with Ms. Ransome, that he never
represented Ms. Ransome, that he did not even know Ms. Ransome, and that Ms. Ransome’s
statements about him were fabricated by Ms. Roberts’ lawyer in retaliation for a bar complaint
that Dershowitz had filed against that lawyer (Exhibit 16). However, as Dershowitz knew:
22
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 23 of 28
(a)
(b)
(c)
He did have sex with Ms. Ransome.
He was Ms. Ransome’s lawyer.
Ms. Ransome’s statements about her involvement with Dershowitz
preceded any contact with Roberts’ attorneys. For example, Ransome’s first
contact with any of Roberts’ lawyers was in November 2016, and at least as early
as October 2016 Ransome had identified Dershowitz in writing to a reporter as
someone who had had sex with one or more of the girls provided by Epstein and
that Epstein had arranged for Dershowitz to be Ransome’s lawyer.
82. After settling the case against him brought by Messrs. Edwards and Cassell,
Dershowitz told the media he had been vindicated, while at the same time insisting that the term
of the settlement remains confidential. Edwards and Cassell responded: “Following the
announcement of the settlement of defamation claims against Alan Dershowitz, he has been
making public statements suggesting that he has prevailed in the lawsuit and that the terms of the
settlement exonerate him of any wrongdoing. Those statements are at best misleading. It is a
mistake for anyone to conclude based upon Mr. Dershowitz’s statements that the case against
him was abandoned due to lack of factual support. It is a mistake for anyone to conclude based
upon Dershowitz’s statements that Bradley Edwards and Paul Cassell had determined that the
allegations against Alan Dershowitz made by Virginia Roberts Giuffre were false or unfounded.
Neither the terms of settlement nor the agreed upon joint public statement issued as part of the
settlement support any such conclusion and it is false to state or suggest otherwise.” Dershowitz
Settles Sex Case, But is He Vindicated? The American Lawyer, April 10, 2016.
83. Dershowitz continues to this day to insist that the terms of his settlement with
Edwards and Cassell remain confidential -- a position that can only be explained by
23
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 24 of 28
Dershowitz’s knowledge that revealing how much he had paid to avoid a trial of the allegations
against him would reveal his guilt.
84. As described above, Dershowitz has also repeatedly asserted that he wanted to
have a trial to establish his innocence. By contrast, he paid to settle the case that would have
provided that trial. He even lied about his being willing to waive the statute of limitations so that
Roberts could sue him for sex abuse -- a lie almost immediately exposed when he was promptly
asked to do so and, equally promptly refused.
COUNT I DEFAMATION
85. Plaintiff Roberts re-alleges paragraphs 1 – 84 as if the same were fully set forth
herein. Dershowitz made his false and defamatory statements deliberately and maliciously with
the intent to intimidate, discredit and defame Roberts.
86. In December 2018, and thereafter, Dershowitz, on behalf of himself and Epstein,
intentionally and maliciously released to the press his false statements about Roberts in an
attempt to destroy Roberts’ reputation and brand her as a liar and cause her to lose all credibility
in her efforts to help victims of sex trafficking.
87. Dershowitz and Epstein knew that Dershowitz’s assertions would dilute, discredit,
and neutralize Roberts’s public and private messages to sexual abuse victims and ultimately
prevent Roberts from effectively providing assistance and advocacy on behalf of other victims of
sex trafficking, or expose her abusers.
88. Using his role as a powerful lawyer with powerful friends, Dershowitz’s
statements were published internationally for the malicious purpose of further damaging a sexual
abuse and sexual trafficking victim; to destroy Roberts’s reputation and credibility; to cause the
24
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 25 of 28
world to disbelieve Roberts; and to destroy Roberts’s efforts to use her experience to help others
suffering as sex trafficking victims.
89. Dershowitz, personally, intentionally, and maliciously made false and damaging
statements of fact concerning Roberts, as detailed above, in the Southern District of New York
and elsewhere.
90. The false statements that Dershowitz made, personally on behalf of himself and
Epstein not only called Roberts’s truthfulness and integrity into question, but also exposed
Roberts to public hatred, contempt, ridicule, and disgrace.
91. At the time Dershowitz made his false statements, he and Epstein, knew full well
that they were completely false.
92. Dershowitz’s false statements constitute libel, as he and Epstein knew that they
were going to be transmitted in writing, widely disseminated on the internet and in print.
Dershowitz intended his false statements to be published by newspaper and other media outlets
internationally, and they were, in fact, published globally, including within the Southern District
of New York.
93. Dershowitz’s false statements constitute libel per se, including that they accused
her of a crime, and including that they exposed Roberts to public contempt, ridicule, aversion,
and disgrace, and induced an evil opinion of her in the minds of right-thinking persons.
94. Dershowitz’s false statements also constitute libel per se, inasmuch, among other
reasons, as they tended to injure Roberts in her professional capacity as the president of a nonprofit
corporation designed to help victims of sex trafficking, and inasmuch as they destroyed her
credibility and reputation among members of the community that seeks her help and that she
seeks to serve.
25
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 26 of 28
95. Dershowitz’s false statements directly stated and also implied that in speaking out
against sex trafficking Roberts acted with fraud, dishonesty, and unfitness for the task.
Dershowitz’s false statements directly and indirectly assert that Roberts lied about being sexually
trafficked and abused by Epstein and having sex with Dershowitz, and that Roberts committed
the crimes of perjury and extortion. Dershowitz’s false statements were reasonably understood
by many persons who read his statements as conveying that specific intention and meaning.
96. Dershowitz’s false statements were reasonably understood by many persons who
read those statements as making specific factual claims that Roberts was lying about specific
facts, and committed the crimes of perjury and extortion.
97. Dershowitz specifically directed his false statements at Roberts’ true public
description of factual events, and many persons who read Dershowitz’s statements reasonably
understood that those statements referred directly to Roberts’ account of the abuse she suffered at
the hands of Epstein and Dershowitz.
98. Dershowitz and Epstein intended Dershowitz’s false statements to be widely
published and disseminated on television, through newspapers, by word of mouth, and on the
internet. As intended by Dershowitz and Epstein, Dershowitz’s statements were published and
disseminated around the world.
99. Dershowitz made his false statements on behalf of himself and Epstein in reckless
disregard of their truth or falsity and with malicious intent to destroy Roberts’s reputation and
credibility; to prevent her from further disseminating her life story; and to cause persons hearing
or reading Roberts’s descriptions of truthful facts to disbelieve her entirely. Dershowitz made his
false statements on behalf of himself and Epstein wantonly and with the specific intent to
maliciously damage Roberts’s good name and reputation in a way that would destroy her efforts
26
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 27 of 28
to administer her non-profit foundation, or share her life story, and thereby help others who have
suffered from sexual abuse.
100. As a result of Dershowitz’s and Epstein’s campaign to spread false, discrediting,
and defamatory statements about Roberts, Roberts suffered substantial damages in an amount to
be proven at trial.
101. Dershowitz’s false statements have caused, and continue to cause, Roberts
economic damage, psychological pain and suffering, mental anguish and emotional distress, and
other direct and consequential damages and losses.
102. Dershowitz’s and Epstein’s campaign to spread his false statements nationally and
internationally was unusual and particularly egregious conduct. Dershowitz and Epstein sexually
abused and trafficked Roberts, conspired to avoid having these crimes properly prosecuted and
discovered, and wantonly and maliciously set out to falsely accuse, defame, and discredit
Roberts to deny and conceal the scope and scale of their crimes. In so doing, Dershowitz’s
efforts constituted a public wrong by deterring, damaging, and setting back Roberts’ efforts to
help victims of sex trafficking. Accordingly, this is a case in which exemplary and punitive
damages are appropriate.
103. Punitive and exemplary damages are necessary in this case to deter Dershowitz,
Epstein and others from wantonly and maliciously using a campaign of lies to discredit Roberts
and other victims of sex trafficking.
PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Roberts respectfully requests judgment against Defendant
Dershowitz, awarding compensatory, consequential, exemplary, and punitive damages in an
27
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 28 of 28
amount to be determined at trial, but in excess of the $75,000 jurisdictional requirement; costs of
suit; attorneys’ fees; and such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.
JURY DEMAND
Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all causes of action asserted within this
pleading.

Even from jail, sex abuser manipulated the system. His victims were kept in the dark
BY Julie K. Brown
NOV. 28, 2018
A decade before #MeToo, a multimillionaire sex offender from Florida got the ultimate break.
��
Palm Beach County Courthouse
June 30, 2008
Jeffrey Edward Epstein appeared at his sentencing dressed comfortably in a blue blazer, blue shirt, jeans and gray sneakers. His attorney, Jack
Goldberger, was at his side.
At the end of the 68-minute hearing, the 55-year-old silver-haired financier — accused of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls — was fingerprinted
and handcuffed, just like any other criminal sentenced in Florida.
But inmate No. W35755 would not be treated like other convicted sex offenders in the state of Florida, which has some of the strictest sex offender laws in
the nation.
Ten years before the #MeToo movement raised awareness about the kid-glove handling of powerful men accused of sexual abuse, Epstein’s lenient
sentence and his extraordinary treatment while in custody are still the source of consternation for the victims he was accused of molesting when they
were minors.
Beginning as far back as 2001, Epstein lured a steady stream of underage girls to his Palm Beach mansion to engage in nude massages, masturbation, oral
sex and intercourse, court and police records show. The girls — mostly from disadvantaged, troubled families — were recruited from middle and high
schools around Palm Beach County. Epstein would pay the girls for massages and offer them further money to bring him new girls every time he was at
his home in Palm Beach, according to police reports.
The girls, now in their late 20s and early 30s, allege in a series of federal civil lawsuits filed over the past decade that Epstein sexually abused hundreds of
girls, not only in Palm Beach, but at his homes in Manhattan, New Mexico and in the Caribbean.
In 2007, the FBI had prepared a 53-page federal indictment charging Epstein with sex crimes that could have put him in federal prison for life. But then-
Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta signed off on a non-prosecution agreement, which was negotiated, signed and sealed so that no one would know
the full scope of Epstein’s crimes. The indictment was shelved, never to be seen again.
Epstein instead pleaded guilty to lesser charges in state court, and was required to register as a sex offender. He was sentenced to 18 months
incarceration.
But Epstein — who had a long list of powerful, politically connected friends — didn’t go to state prison like most sex offenders in Florida. Instead, the
multimillionaire was assigned to a private wing of the Palm Beach County stockade, where he was able to hire his own security detail. Even then, he didn’t
spend much time in a cell. He was allowed to go to his downtown West Palm Beach office for work release, up to 12 hours a day, six days a week, records
show.

Sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein was surrounded by powerful people. Here’s a sampling
He was permitted to hire his own private psychologist for his required sex-offender counseling, and after his release from jail, his subsequent year of
probation under house arrest was filled with trips on his corporate jet to Manhattan and to his home in the U.S. Virgin Islands — all approved by the courts
with no objections from the state.
On the morning of his sentencing in 2008, none of Epstein’s victims were in the courtroom to protest his soft jail term or the unusual provisions of his
incarceration and probation — and that was by design.
Palm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein is a free man, despite sexually abusing dozens of underage girls according to police and prosecutors. His
victims have never had a voice, until now.
By
Emails and letters contained in court filings reveal the cozy, behind-the-scenes dealings between federal prosecutors and Epstein’s indomitable legal
team during the run-up to his federal plea deal, as they discussed ways to minimize his criminal charges and avoid informing the girls about the details of
the deal until after the case was resolved.
That arrangement benefited Epstein in a number of ways. Unlike other high-profile sex crime cases, federal prosecutors agreed to keep his sentencing
quiet, thereby limiting media coverage. His underage victims — identified in FBI documents — weren’t told about the plea deal so they weren’t in court,
where they could voice their objections and possibly sway the judge to give Epstein a harsher sentence or reject the agreement altogether.
Most important, Epstein’s crimes would be reduced to felony prostitution charges, giving him the ability to argue that the girls weren’t victims at all —
they were prostitutes.
Four accomplices named in Epstein’s non-prosecution agreement — Nadia Marcinkova, Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross and Lesley Groff — were also given
immunity from federal prosecution. Marcinkova was a young girl when Epstein brought her from Yugoslavia to live with him. Several victims told police
that she was involved in orgies with Epstein and underage girls. Ross, Groff and Kellen, now known by her married name, Vickers, were schedulers who
arranged his underage sex sessions, according to the FBI and police.
Marcinkova and Kellen, through their attorneys, declined to comment for this story. The Herald was unsuccessful in reaching Ross and Groff.

Acosta, who is now President Donald Trump’s secretary of labor, told lawmakers last year at his confirmation hearing that he did not know that Epstein
would receive such liberal treatment while incarcerated. But court records show that federal prosecutors under his authority acquiesced to many of
Epstein’s demands, including that he not go to federal or state prison.
“I can’t remember how I found out that he had taken a plea,’’ said Courtney Wild, identified by the FBI as one of more than three dozen underage girls —
some of them as young as 13 — who had been molested by Epstein at his waterfront estate between 2001 and 2005.
“We were purposefully misled into believing that his sentencing [in state court] had nothing to do with the federal crimes he committed against me or the
other girls.’’
Epstein, now 65, was released in 2009 after serving 13 months.
Wild, who was 14 when she met Epstein, is suing the federal government, alleging that prosecutors kept her and other victims in the dark as part of a
conspiracy to give Epstein — described in the lawsuit as “a powerful, politically connected multimillionaire” — one of the most lenient deals for a serial
child sex offender in history.
Courtney Wild is suing the federal government, claiming that prosecutors deliberately kept her and other victims of Jeffrey Epstein in the dark about the status of his case. The
U.S. Attorney’s Office signed a non-prosecution agreement with the multimillionaire. Emily Michot EMICHOT@MIAMIHERALD.COM
Now 31, Wild is Jane Doe No. 1 in “Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 vs. the United States,” which seeks to overturn Epstein’s plea agreement on the grounds that
it was executed in violation of the federal Crime Victims’ Rights Act. The measure affords crime victims a series of rights, including to confer with
prosecutors and to be notified about plea negotiations and sentencing.
That lawsuit — and an unrelated state court case scheduled for trial on Dec. 4 — could expose more about Epstein’s crimes, as well as who else was
involved and whether there was any undue influence that tainted the federal case.

Some of Epstein’s victims will finally have an opportunity to testify for the first time as part of the Dec. 4 case in state court in Palm Beach County. It pits
Fort Lauderdale attorney Bradley Edwards against Epstein, who had accused Edwards of malfeasance in his representation of several victims.
Jack Scarola, the attorney representing Edwards, said Epstein should be held accountable for his unrelenting attacks against Edwards — as well as others
who were involved in his case.
“We are going to demonstrate through this case that no one — no matter how much money they have — can abuse children and then attempt to bully
those who come to the defense of children,’’ said Scarola, a former state prosecutor.
Florida and beyond
Few people had as much insight into Epstein’s lifestyle — and its international reach — as Virginia Roberts. By age 16, Roberts had lived a life that was
beyond that of most high school girls.
At 11, she says, she was sexually molested by a family friend. At 12, she was smoking pot and skipping school. At 13, she was in and out of foster homes, and
at 14, she was on the street.
In Miami, the runaway became a captive of a 65-year-old sex trafficker, Ron Eppinger. For months, she says, she was sexually abused, kept in an
apartment and pimped out to pedophiles. After his indictment in 2000 on trafficking charges, Roberts returned to West Palm Beach and tried to heal.

Virginia Roberts, now Giuffre, says she was 16 and working as a locker room attendant at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort when she was approached by Ghislaine Maxwell,
Jeffrey Epstein’s associate, about becoming a masseuse for Epstein. COURTESY OF VIRGINIA ROBERTS
That summer, when Roberts was 16, she said her father helped her get a job as a locker room attendant at the spa at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in
Palm Beach, records show. Her father worked at the resort as a maintenance man.
There she said she met Ghislaine Maxwell, an Epstein friend and socialite daughter of the late British publishing magnate Robert Maxwell. She offered
Roberts an opportunity to become a massage therapist, working for Epstein.
In a sworn court affidavit and in a recent interview with the Herald, Roberts described how Epstein and Maxwell began grooming her — not just to
perform massages, but to sexually pleasure them and others.
“It started with one and it trickled into two and so on,’’ Roberts told the Herald. “And before you know it, I’m being lent out to politicians and academics
and royalty.’’
Roberts, too, was ordered to find Epstein girls — the younger, the better — by trolling areas where teenagers congregated, such as shopping malls, to lure
girls to whatever residence Epstein was staying in at the time, she told the Herald.
She began to travel with Epstein and Maxwell to Epstein’s other homes, in New York, New Mexico and the U.S. Virgin Islands — and her trips are
documented in flight logs that frequently list her name or her initials as a passenger, court records show.
“His appetite was insatiable. He wanted new girls, fresh, young faces every single day — that was just the sickness that he had,’’ Roberts said.
Neither Epstein nor his lead attorney, Goldberger, responded to requests for comment.
Roberts alleges that Epstein had cameras throughout his homes and said he liked her to tell him about the sexual peccadilloes of various important men
she had sex with.
“Epstein and Maxwell also got girls for Epstein’s friends and acquaintances. Epstein specifically told me that the reason for him doing this was so that
they would ‘owe him,’ they would ‘be in his pocket,’ and he would ‘have something on them,’ ” Roberts said in a court affidavit. “I understood him to

mean that when someone was in his pocket, they owed him favors.’’
Roberts elaborated in her interview with the Herald, saying that Epstein had access to girls through a modeling agency that recruited them from overseas.
Epstein, who was close to Les Wexner, the owner of Victoria’s Secret, often talked about his connections to people in the modeling, fashion and acting
industries, Roberts told the Herald.
“He [Epstein] would tell the girls, ‘Hey, I will give you a modeling contract if you go have sex with this man [whichever acquaintance Epstein
designated],’ ’’ she said.
Roberts’ story about the modeling agency is supported, to a degree, by the sworn statement of a Miami woman named Maritza Vasquez, who was later
interviewed in New York by an FBI agent from Miami. Vasquez worked as a bookkeeper for Mc2, owned by Epstein associate Jean-Luc Brunel. He
employed scouts in South America, Europe and the former Soviet Union to find him models to bring to the United States, Vasquez said in a 2010 sworn
court deposition obtained by the Herald.
Vasquez stated in the deposition that from 2003 to 2006 she handled all the finances and payroll for the agency, including a bank transaction involving
Epstein. She said Epstein invested $1 million in Mc2.
The models were often very young — 13, 14 and 15 — and some of them were housed in apartments at 301 E. 66th St. in New York, a building purportedly
owned by Epstein, the deposition said.
Epstein didn’t charge the girls rent, Vasquez said, but Brunel charged them $1,000 a month, with four of them at a time sharing one apartment. The girls
who were the youngest and most beautiful stayed at the 66th Street apartments, which were more luxurious than the other apartments that were used to
house models who were not as young and desirable, she said.
Vasquez once let one of the models, who was 14, stay overnight with her after the girl ran into trouble with police for trying to get into a Manhattan
nightclub. Vasquez also testified that she helped a lawyer obtain visas for the foreign models, and assisted with their transportation to and from modeling
assignments and parties.
Vasquez said that even though the agency employed 200 to 300 models, the company didn’t make any money and Brunel was always broke. Brunel would
later sue Epstein, alleging that the financier’s sex scandal had caused his business to fail, but the suit was eventually dropped.
Vasquez testified it wasn’t unusual for the agency to send girls to an assignment with a wealthy client for $100,000 or more, but the girl wouldn’t be paid
the full amount — or anything at all — if she refused to be “molested.’’
Vasquez considered herself a mother figure and often coached the youngest girls to stick to the 9-to-5 modeling assignments because she didn’t think it
was appropriate for them to be having sex.
She said she met Epstein only once, but she often helped arrange for girls — many of them underage — to be sent to his homes in New York, Palm Beach
and his island in the Caribbean for parties. She heard salacious rumors about Epstein’s parties, but testified she had no firsthand knowledge about
whether they involved sex.
Vasquez said that she was questioned by the FBI and she tried to tell agents where to look for evidence.
Vasquez was eventually let go from the agency after she was accused of stealing money — money she claims was given to her by Brunel. Vasquez said she
was placed on probation for the theft. She never heard from the FBI about Epstein again.
The Herald was unsuccessful in reaching Brunel through his former attorney.
In a written statement released in 2015, Brunel denied any involvement in trafficking underage models.
“I strongly deny having participated, neither directly nor indirectly, in the actions Mr. Jeffrey Epstein is being accused of,” he said. “I strongly deny
having committed any illicit act or any wrongdoing in the course of my work as a scouter or model agencies manager.”
Too old at 19
In 2003, when Roberts turned 19, it was clear that Epstein had lost interest because she was too old for him, she said. She convinced him to pay for her to
get training to become a real professional masseuse so that she could move on.
In an interview, she explained that Epstein arranged for her to take a class in Thailand, but it came with a hitch: She said she was instructed to pick up a
Thai girl he had arranged to come to the States.

Roberts, who showed the Herald the written instructions for the rendezvous, never picked up the girl because Roberts met a man on the trip who would
become her husband. The couple married and moved to Australia, where they currently live.
In 2007 — at the same time the FBI was investigating Epstein — Roberts, pregnant with her second child, said she unexpectedly received phone calls from
Maxwell and Epstein. She said they were worried that she had told police about them. She assured them she had not spoken to anyone, she said.
Shortly afterward, Roberts said, she was contacted by someone who claimed to be with the FBI. But she was afraid to tell that person details, fearing it was
really an Epstein associate posing as an FBI agent.
That agent, identified in court papers as Timothy Slater, confirmed that he and the other agent on the case, Nesbitt Kuyrkendall, called Roberts in January
or February 2007. In a sworn statement, Slater said he informed Roberts that they suspected she was a victim of Epstein’s.
The agent said Roberts answered basic questions, but became uncomfortable and “asked that I not bother her again.’’
Roberts said the agent didn’t try too hard to convince her to talk, and she was surprised when he hung up after asking her a few graphic questions about
her sex life. She said she was suspicious, but would have cooperated had the FBI talked to her in person and explained why they were asking about
Epstein.
“I was still scared to death,’’ Roberts said. “Jeffrey used to tell me that he owned the entire Palm Beach Police Department. I just didn’t want my family
harmed.’’
She nevertheless was listed by federal prosecutors as one of Epstein’s Palm Beach victims.
As the years went by and Roberts had a daughter, she would be haunted by a fear that Epstein was still taking advantage of young girls. In 2011, she went
public in a paid interview with a British tabloid, the Daily Mail, asserting that she had had sex with Prince Andrew, one of Epstein’s friends, several times
when she was a teen.
In her 2015 affidavit, she discussed in detail some of her alleged sex encounters with the prince and Epstein’s other friends, including lawyer Alan
Dershowitz. Edwards included the affidavit in the court file as part of the Jane Does’ Crime Victims’ Rights Act case, at which time it became public.

In the affidavit, Roberts claimed that Epstein and Maxwell directed her to have sex with Andrew and Dershowitz and others. She had sex with Andrew
three times, she alleged — once in London, when she was 17, again in New York, when she was 17, and a third time, as part of an orgy on Epstein’s island,
when she was 18. By law, at 17, she would have been above the age of consent in New York and England, but not in Florida, where the age of consent is 18.
As part of the affidavit, Roberts furnished a photograph of her with the prince and Maxwell, which she said was taken in London.
Dershowitz, who was part of Epstein’s criminal defense team, was often a guest at Epstein’s homes, she said.
“I had sexual intercourse with Dershowitz at least six times,’’ Roberts wrote in the 2015 court affidavit. “The first time was when I was about 16, early on
in my servitude to Epstein and it continued until I was 19.’’ She detailed some of those alleged trysts, which she said happened at Epstein’s homes in Palm
Beach, New Mexico and on Epstein’s island.
One of Epstein’s housemen, Juan Alessi, testified in a 2009 sworn deposition that Dershowitz visited Epstein’s Palm Beach home four or five times a year.
He said that Roberts was a frequent visitor as well, but he never placed Dershowitz and Roberts at the house at the same time.
Alessi, who testified he worked for Epstein from 1999 to 2002, said there were often young girls who gave massages at the house, even in the middle of the
night. But he said he never checked their ages, and only knew one girl for certain who was underage, because he had picked her up from high school. That
girl, who is now an actress, was not one of Epstein’s masseuses, Alessi said.
He also said he was Maxwell’s driver, and he recalls waiting outside of Mar-a-Lago the day Maxwell met Roberts. He testified he saw Maxwell talking to
Roberts and recalls Roberts coming to Epstein’s mansion later that day. One of Alessi’s jobs was to drive Maxwell to various spas in Palm Beach where she
left business cards in order to “recruit’’ more masseuses, he said in the sworn deposition.
Dershowitz, Prince Andrew and Maxwell have long denied Roberts’ allegations.
In an interview with the Herald, Dershowitz reiterated that he had never met Roberts, and never saw Epstein with any underage girls.
“The story was 100 percent flatly categorically made-up,’’ he said, adding that Roberts and her attorneys fabricated the assertion in order to get money
from other powerful, wealthy people she alleges she had sex with.
“The only possible reason to accuse me in public and [them] in private is so she could get money,’’ Dershowitz said.
Edwards and his co-counsel in the Crime Victims’ lawsuit, University of Utah law professor Paul Cassell, sued Dershowitz for defamation and Dershowitz
countersued in 2015. The case was settled out of court, with Dershowitz saying he had been vindicated.
Dershowitz said he received a massage at Epstein’s Palm Beach home only once — but that it was just a regular, therapeutic massage by a masseuse — not
by Roberts or anyone underage. Dershowitz’s wife was there at Epstein’s house at the time, Dershowitz said in the deposition taken for the case in 2015.
“I never had any knowledge of Jeffrey Epstein having any contact with any underage women — ever,’’ Dershowitz told the Herald.
Edwards and Cassell admitted making a “tactical mistake” in filing the accusations against Dershowitz as part of a lawsuit not involving him. But they
emphasized that the settlement had no bearing on the veracity of Roberts’ allegations.
The judge for the Crime Victims’ Rights Act lawsuit agreed that the affidavit was misplaced in that case, and it was dropped.
Prince Andrew’s spokesman at Buckingham Palace did not respond to an email requesting comment.
Roberts, now 35, said it has taken her a long time to stand up to Epstein. She and 20 other victims received settlements from Epstein, ranging from
$50,000 to more than $1 million. The exact amounts have been kept confidential.
“It takes so long until you are able to speak about it. It took me having a daughter and looking at this young, beautiful innocent baby to say I want to speak
out about it now. I’m hoping that this will bring out more girls so that they say, Me Too.’’
The state court hearing
The judge at Epstein’s sentencing hearing at the Palm Beach County Courthouse knew very little about Epstein’s crimes. The sentencing paperwork was
restricted to Epstein’s specific charges: one count of solicitation of prostitution and one count of procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution.

“Are there more than one victim?’’ Circuit Court Judge Deborah Dale Pucillo asked the prosecutor at Epstein’s sentencing on June 30, 2008.
“There’s several,’’ replied assistant state prosecutor Lanna Belohlavek.
“Are all the victims in both of these cases in agreement with the terms of this plea?’‘ Pucillo later asked.
“Yes,’‘ Belohlavek replied, telling the judge that she had spoken to “several” of Epstein’s victims.
Emails show that federal prosecutors didn’t want the judge to know how many victims and accomplices there were.
Federal prosecutor A. Marie Villafaña — in a September 2007 email to Epstein lawyer Jay Lefkowitz — said: “I will mention co-conspirators but I would
prefer not to highlight for the judge all the other crimes and all the other persons that we could charge.’’
Attorney Spencer Kuvin happened to be in court that day because he’d heard Epstein was to appear, but Kuvin didn’t know why. He figured he’d use it as
an opportunity to serve Epstein with civil court papers involving one of several victims he represented. Instead, he listened to what was happening and
couldn’t believe that no one had contacted him or his clients.
“I was shocked to learn that the proceeding involved my client’s case and there was nothing I could do except watch as they disposed of her case without
ever telling her,’’ Kuvin said.
At the hearing, Belohlavek and Epstein’s attorney, Goldberger, were in sync, the court transcript shows. Epstein would be required to register as a sex
offender, but his probation would not be served under the strict requirements of sex offender probation.

The judge didn’t question those provisions, but she did ask why Epstein was going to serve his sentence in the Palm Beach County stockade instead of in a
Florida state prison, like most sex offenders.

After he pleaded guilty in state court, Jeffrey Epstein was assigned to a private section of the Palm Beach County stockade. Soon, however, he was allowed to leave the
compound six days a week, 12 hours a day, for what was termed work release. Emily Michot EMICHOT@MIAMIHERALD.COM
“We just decided that was the best way to accomplish what needed to be done here and the parties agreed that that sentence satisfied everyone’s
requirements,’’ Goldberger replied.
Said Judge Pucillo: “The taxpayers of Palm Beach County are going to pay 18 months to house this guy instead of DOC [the Department of Corrections]?”
Belohlavek: “Right.’’
Pucillo did not respond to a request for comment on the case.
Villafaña, the lead federal prosecutor in Epstein’s case, was in the courtroom, but there’s no indication she objected to Epstein’s cozier jail
accommodations.
When he entered jail in July 2008, Epstein was arguably the most well-known inmate there. Records also show that Epstein hired Palm Beach sheriff’s
deputies for his security details, paying them for the hours they spent monitoring him on work release at his West Palm Beach office, where he often
stayed until 10 p.m., jail logs show.
The Herald reviewed their time sheets, showing that the deputies logged visitors coming and going to and from his office throughout the day. A record log
of his visitors was kept in a safe, but the log no longer exists, according to a spokeswoman for the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office.
One deputy who often worked Epstein’s detail said that his assignment was to stay in a front reception room of Epstein’s office. Epstein was in a separate
office — with the door closed — most of the day as he accepted visitors, both male and female, the deputies’ logs show.
“It was not our job to monitor what he was doing in that office,’’ the deputy,
now retired, told the Herald.
In their early reports in July 2008, the deputies referred to Epstein as
“inmate’’ but within a few weeks the language had changed and he was
called a “client.” He was occasionally allowed to take a break for lunch by
sitting outside in a park, the records show, and they also gave him
permission to scout for a new office. While on work release, he was required
to wear an ankle bracelet to monitor his whereabouts.

The work release was approved by the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office,
said spokeswoman Therese Barbera.
“Jeffrey Epstein, while in custody, met the criteria for the Work Release
Program,’’ Barbera wrote in an email. “There was no factual basis to deny
Mr. Epstein the same availability of this program that is offered to other
inmates under similar circumstances. Mr. Epstein was closely monitored
and there were no problems encountered during his time in the program.”

conflicting explanations over the past six months about who is responsible for ensuring that he is complying with the law.
On Nov. 14, the Herald asked the sheriff’s office for a full accounting of Epstein’s check-ins for 2018. The record the office supplied two days later showed
he registered in January and in July — as required. But PBSO also inexplicably had him registering on Nov. 14 — the very same day that the Herald asked
for the records from the sheriff’s office.
When asked about this sudden registration, Barbera replied: “The information we provided you was a snapshot from the FDLE website. Perhaps,
someone from FDLE can provide a reason for you.’’
Said FDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger in an email: “The screenshot is not on the public registry. This is information inputted by the local agency when
the offender comes into the local sheriff’s office to register.’’
Plessinger said Epstein is not covered by the state’s new three-day rule, which requires sex offenders to re-register when they come to stay in Florida for
three days or more. His town of Palm Beach home is already on file, as a temporary residence, she said.
So it’s not clear why he would have suddenly registered a third time on Nov. 14.
State Sen. Lauren Book, a child sex abuse survivor and vocal advocate for tough sex offender monitoring, called the case an appalling example of how
those in the justice system allow wealthy people to skirt the law and bend the rules.
“These prosecutors, and judges and sheriffs who are making these decisions and allowing things to fly — we have to hold these people accountable. They
are supposed to uphold the law — regardless of who a person is and how much money they have in the bank or who they had on their airplane.’’
Piece by piece
Over the years, Courtney Wild, Virginia Roberts and more than a dozen other women who say they were victims of Epstein have been quietly challenging
the traditional legal norms that have failed to punish Epstein and other men in positions of power for sexual abuse.
Epstein has paid millions of dollars in civil compensation that, for the most part, has kept the details about his operation out of the public eye. As a result,
much — but not all — of the testimony and evidence collected as part of the vast litigation has been sealed or redacted from public court records.

The girls who were abused by Jeffrey Epstein and the cops who championed their cause remain angry over what they regard as a gross injustice, while
Epstein's employees and those who engineered his non-prosecution agreement have prospered.
By
Taking a page from Epstein’s legal team, lawyers representing Epstein’s victims hired private investigators and former police detectives to dig into
Epstein’s life. Over the past decade, they’ve tracked down hundreds of people, including dozens of other potential victims; they’ve interviewed Epstein’s
recruiters, bookkeepers, housekeepers, butlers, pilots and drivers. They’ve traveled around the country and the world, taking statements and sworn
depositions, coaxing people to talk who had previously been too reticent to come forward.
In short, they did what criminal prosecutors didn’t do.
Some of the information they’ve learned was given to federal authorities in New York. Edwards said those authorities have shown no interest in opening a
new investigation focused on crimes he is alleged to have committed in that state, where he is listed as a level 3 sex offender, the most dangerous
category, considered at risk to re-offend, records show. In New York, he has to register every 90 days.

Holding abusers accountable
In 2015, Roberts sued Maxwell for defamation in New York after Maxwell called her a liar in a news interview. The civil lawsuit was an effort by Roberts
not just to clear her name, but an attempt to prove that Epstein and Maxwell operated an international underage sex trafficking operation. The lawsuit
was settled out of court in 2017 and nearly all the evidence presented in the case has been sealed.
Roberts’ attorney, Sigrid McCawley, claims that Roberts received a sizable settlement, although the amount is confidential.
“She wanted to hold her abusers accountable and we were able to do that by bringing this case … which we ultimately settled very successfully for her,’’
said McCawley, an associate of noted Bush-Gore recount lawyer David Boies, who has also pursued cases against Epstein in federal court in New York.

Maxwell’s lawyer, Laura Menninger, declined to comment, referring the Herald to the court history.
“[Roberts] fabricated a story of abuse at the hands of Ms. Maxwell in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars from British tabloids with a motive
for selling papers and advertisements and without regard for truth, veracity or substantiation,’’ Menninger noted in a 2016 response filed in the case.
In February, the Miami Herald filed a federal court motion in the Southern District of New York, seeking access to documents that were sealed in the
Maxwell case. The motion, which was not opposed by Roberts, could have cast light on the full scope of Epstein’s possible sex trafficking operation, who
was involved and whether it was covered up. Maxwell has opposed the Herald’s motion, which was denied in August.
The Herald is appealing.
Today, Epstein has a new private jet, which takes him around the world. Flight records show that he spends most of his time on his private island, Little St.
James in the U.S. Virgin Islands, which he now lists as his permanent residence. He is registered in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands as a sex offender.
New Mexico, where he owns a sprawling ranch, does not list him as a convicted sex offender.
As part of its investigation, the Herald learned that in 2013, the federal government conceded that it had given Epstein what it called “valuable
consideration” for information he provided to the FBI as part of his plea deal. The documents do not elaborate, but Epstein — a hedge fund manager who
once worked for the investment firm Bear Stearns — was listed as a key investor who lost money in the financial crash of 2008.
Francey Hakes, a former federal child sex crimes prosecutor, said any consideration the government gave to Epstein should be made public.
“The public has a right to know why he got a slap on the wrist, and what was the interest that was so great that allowed him to not get prosecuted?”

federal law in recent years, adding more precise language mandating that
prosecutors notify victims about plea bargains and allow victims to be heard
at sentencing.
Because some statute-of-limitation laws set deadlines for filing civil and
criminal sex crime cases, it’s difficult to bring them years later, said Marci
Hamilton, a University of Pennsylvania professor who is working to ease

those restrictions across the country.
Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of a British press magnate and Jeffrey Epstein’s close
associate when he was inviting underage girls into his bedroom, leads a TED Talk on
environmental issues.
But she points out that there has been no statute of limitations for federal sex crimes involving children since 2002.
Children who are sexually abused often take decades to reveal what happened to them, in part because their brains aren’t wired at a young age to
understand the trauma they’ve experienced, said Kenneth V. Lanning, a retired FBI agent who investigated and studied child sex crimes for 40 years.
“We want to hold children to some superhuman standard because they behave this way. In reality, police, prosecutors and judges have to understand that
children are not all angels from heaven. They are just plain human beings who are emotionally immature so we have to protect them from their own
decisions.’’
Wild, who continues to fight her federal case on behalf of all of Epstein’s victims, said she hopes that the federal judge hearing the Crime Victims’ Rights
case will make a ruling soon, one that will send a message to prosecutors who fail to consider the rights of crime victims.
“Really if you think about this too hard, it’s scary because this is our government that is supposed to protect us but has done everything to protect a
pedophile,’’ she said.

Alan Dershowitz: ‘I never had sex with Virginia Roberts’ | Miami
Herald
miamiherald.com/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/article222532470.html
In its series on the Jeffrey Epstein case, “Perversion of Justice,” the Herald quotes an
affidavit by Virginia Roberts — a woman I never met — claiming she had sex with me on
Epstein’s island, ranch, plane and mansion. It then simply says I “denied” it.
In fact, I disproved it. I produced my travel, phone, credit card and TV appearance
records, conclusively proving that I could not have been and was not in any of these
places during the time Roberts knew Epstein. The former FBI director, assisted by a
former assistant U.S. attorney and a chief federal marshal, reviewed these records and
the other evidence and concluded that, “The totality of the evidence found during the
investigation refutes the allegations.”
There is other evidence, currently under seal, that directly establishes my innocence. I am
seeking to unseal emails between Roberts and a journalist, a book manuscript by Roberts
and a legal brief that are smoking guns showing that I was “deliberately framed for
financial reasons.”

There is also irrefutable evidence that Roberts lied about other people for money. She
told a British tabloid that she met Al and Tipper Gore on Epstein’s island and swore that
she had dinner with Bill Clinton on the island. But Secret Service records prove that none
of these people were on the island. Indeed, the Gores didn’t even know Epstein.

I have a tape recording of a conversation with Roberts’ closest friend in which she says
that Roberts told her she “felt pressure to go after [Dershowitz]” in order to obtain
money from a wealthy businessman, and that Roberts had never previously included me
among the people with whom she claimed to have had sex.
Finally, one of Roberts’ own lawyers has acknowledged in front of witnesses that her
claims against me are “wrong” “simply wrong.”
The evidence of my innocence is indisputable: I never met Roberts; I never had sex with
her; she simply made up the entire story for money.
Roberts made her false claims against me in court documents that immunize her from
being sued for defamation. I challenge her to repeat her false accusations out of court,
so that I can sue her for defamation and let a jury decide — after seeing all the evidence,

Dershowitz Goes Off on Woman Who Made Underage Sex
Allegations: ‘She Should Be Seriously Punished’

Just hours after convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein agreed to settle
a civil case brought against him by attorney Bradley
Edwards, Epstein’s lawyer from his past criminal case, Alan
Dershowitz, discussed his former client on the Law&Crime Network.
Epstein was accused of trafficking more than 40 underage girls for
sex, and one such girl claimed Dershowitz himself had sex with her
when she was underage.
Dershowitz vehemently denies the claim, telling host Brian Ross that
accuser Virginia Roberts is a “certified, complete, total liar,” and that
her allegations are a “complete and total fabrication.” He also added
that she should be punished by the law for what she did.
The Harvard Law Professor Emeritus noted that Roberts’ allegations
were eventually withdrawn, and that the FBI recognized the
evidence showed he was not where she said he was. He pointed to
documented evidence that proves he is innocent.
“I can prove conclusively that she made the whole thing up,”
Dershowitz said, citing travel records that he says prove where he
was at the time she claims she had sex with him. “It’s conclusive,
conclusive evidence.”
“More importantly, I can prove where I wasn’t,” he said, after stating
outright, “Never met her, don’t know who she is, never heard of her.”
Similarly, Dershowitz said that Roberts claimed that notable figures
such as Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and Tipper Gore were present on an

island, when Secret Service records proved they were never even
there.
Dershowitz said Roberts’ allegations were part of an extortion plot,
and that she “should be seriously punished for submitting false
information and a false affidavit.”
The attorney emphasized that Roberts has not been willing to repeat
her allegations against him in public, and that she has only accused
him in the context of litigation, which affords certain protections.

“She simply hides behind litigation privileges,” Dershowitz said,
encouraging Ross to call Roberts and see if she would repeat her
claims. “And if she does, I will be in court the next day suing her for
defamation and I will win the case ’cause I can prove conclusively
that she made up the whole story from top to bottom.”
Ross then turned to the controversial deal that Epstein received from
federal prosecutors who were investigating the trafficking case
against him. Federal prosecutors agreed not to prosecute him, and let
him plead guilty to state charges that resulted in a 13-month prison
sentence that allowed Epstein to leave prison during the day for
work. Federal prosecutors allegedly did not even inform victims
before making the deal, which is now the subject of a request for an
Inspector General investigation. Congressional Democrats said in a
letter that they want to know more about the circumstances
surrounding the deal, which was made by then-U.S. Attorney and
current Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta.
As Epstein’s defense attorney in that case, Dershowitz is not upset
about it the deal at all.
“I’m very proud of that deal, that’s what lawyers are supposed to do,”
he said. “Lawyers are supposed to get the best deals they can.” If he
could have gotten 10 months or no time at all, that would have been
even better, he said.
Acosta said in the past that Epstein’s lawyers, including Dershowitz,
put pressure on his office by investigating his staff. Dershowitz has
denied this.
“Acosta was very tough,” Dershowitz said, contrary to concerns that
he did anything improper. Dershowitz pointed out that the problem
feds had was proving that girls were transported in interstate
commerce.

The Talented Mr. Epstein
Lately, Jeffrey Epstein’s high-flying style has been drawing oohs and aahs: the bachelor
financier lives in New York’s largest private residence, claims to take only billionaires as clients,
and flies celebrities including Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey on his Boeing 727. But pierce his
air of mystery and the picture changes. Vicky Ward explores Epstein’s investment career, his ties
to retail magnate Leslie Wexner, and his complicated past.

June 27, 2011 12:00 am
On Manhattan’s Upper East Side, home to some of the most expensive real estate on earth, exists
the crown jewel of the city’s residential town houses. With its 15-foot-high oak door, huge
arched windows, and nine floors, it sits on—or, rather, commands—the block of 71st Street
between Fifth and Madison Avenues. Almost ludicrously out of proportion with its four- and
five-story neighbors, it seems more like an institution than a house. This is perhaps not
surprising—until 1989 it was the Birch Wathen private school. Now it is said to be Manhattan’s
largest private residence.
Inside, amid the flurry of menservants attired in sober black suits and pristine white gloves, you
feel you have stumbled into someone’s private Xanadu. This is no mere rich person’s home, but
a high-walled, eclectic, imperious fantasy that seems to have no boundaries.
The entrance hall is decorated not with paintings but with row upon row of individually framed
eyeballs; these, the owner tells people with relish, were imported from England, where they were
made for injured soldiers. Next comes a marble foyer, which does have a painting, in the manner
of Jean Dubuffet … but the host coyly refuses to tell visitors who painted it. In any case, guests
are like pygmies next to the nearby twice-life-size sculpture of a naked African warrior.
Despite its eccentricity the house is curiously impersonal, the statement of someone who wants
to be known for the scale of his possessions. Its occupant, financier Jeffrey Epstein, 50, admits to
friends that he likes it when people think of him this way. A good-looking man, resembling
Ralph Lauren, with thick gray-white hair and a weathered face, he usually dresses in jeans, knit
shirts, and loafers. He tells people he bought the house because he knew he “could never live
anywhere bigger.” He thinks 51,000 square feet is an appropriately large space for someone like
himself, who deals mostly in large concepts—especially large sums of money.
Guests are invited to lunch or dinner at the town house—Epstein usually refers to the former as
“tea,” since he likes to eat bite-size morsels and drink copious quantities of Earl Grey. (He does
not touch alcohol or tobacco.) Tea is served in the “leather room,” so called because of the
cordovan-colored fabric on the walls. The chairs are covered in a leopard print, and on the wall
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-8 Filed 04/16/19 Page 3 of 16
http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey‐epstein‐200303
hangs a huge, Oriental fantasy of a woman holding an opium pipe and caressing a snarling
lionskin. Under her gaze, plates of finger sandwiches are delivered to Epstein and guests by the
menservants in white gloves.
Upstairs, to the right of a spiral staircase, is the “office,” an enormous gallery spanning the width
of the house. Strangely, it holds no computer. Computers belong in the “computer room” (a
smaller room at the back of the house), Epstein has been known to say. The office features a
gilded desk (which Epstein tells people belonged to banker J. P. Morgan), 18th-century black
lacquered Portuguese cabinets, and a nine-foot ebony Steinway “D” grand. On the desk, a
paperback copy of the Marquis de Sade’s The Misfortunes of Virtue was recently spotted.
Covering the floor, Epstein has explained, “is the largest Persian rug you’ll ever see in a private
home—so big, it must have come from a mosque.” Amid such splendor, much of which reflects
the work of the French decorator Alberto Pinto, who has worked for Jacques Chirac and the
royal families of Jordan and Saudi Arabia, there is one particularly startling oddity: a stuffed
black poodle, standing atop the grand piano. “No decorator would ever tell you to do that,”
Epstein brags to visitors. “But I want people to think what it means to stuff a dog.” People can’t
help but feel it’s Epstein’s way of saying that he always has the last word.
ADVERTISEMENT
In addition to the town house, Epstein lives in what is reputed to be the largest private dwelling
in New Mexico, on an $18 million, 7,500-acre ranch which he named “Zorro.” “It makes the
town house look like a shack,” Epstein has said. He also owns Little St. James, a 70-acre island
in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where the main house is currently being renovated by Edward Tuttle,
a designer of the Amanresorts. There is also a $6.8 million house in Palm Beach, Florida, and a
fleet of aircraft: a Gulfstream IV, a helicopter, and a Boeing 727, replete with trading room, on
which Epstein recently flew President Clinton, actors Chris Tucker and Kevin Spacey,
supermarket magnate Ron Burkle, Lew Wasserman’s grandson, Casey Wasserman, and a few
others, on a mission to explore the problems of AIDS and economic development in Africa.
Epstein is charming, but he doesn’t let the charm slip into his eyes. They are steely and
calculating, giving some hint at the steady whir of machinery running behind them. “Let’s play
chess,” he said to me, after refusing to give an interview for this article. “You be white. You get
the first move.” It was an appropriate metaphor for a man who seems to feel he can win no
matter what the advantage of the other side. His advantage is that no one really seems to know
him or his history completely or what his arsenal actually consists of. He has carefully
engineered it so that he remains one of the few truly baffling mysteries among New York’s
moneyed world. People know snippets, but few know the whole.
“He’s very enigmatic,” says Rosa Monckton, the former C.E.O. of Tiffany & Co. in the U.K. and
a close friend since the early 1980s. “You think you know him and then you peel off another ring
of the onion skin and there’s something else extraordinary underneath. He never reveals his
hand…. He’s a classic iceberg. What you see is not what you get.”
Even acquaintances sense a curious dichotomy: Yes, he lives like a “modern maharaja,” as Leah
Kleman, one of his art dealers, puts it. Yet he is fastidiously, almost obsessively private—he lists
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-8 Filed 04/16/19 Page 4 of 16

himself in the phone book under a pseudonym. He rarely attends society gatherings or weddings
or funerals; he considers eating in restaurants like “eating on the subway”—i.e., something he’d
never do. There are many women in his life, mostly young, but there is no one of them to whom
he has been able to commit. He describes his most public companion of the last decade,
Ghislaine Maxwell, 41, the daughter of the late, disgraced media baron Robert Maxwell, as
simply his “best friend.” He says she is not on his payroll, but she seems to organize much of his
life—recently she was making telephone inquiries to find a California-based yoga instructor for
him. (Epstein is still close to his two other long-term girlfriends, Paula Heil Fisher, a former
associate of his at the brokerage firm Bear Stearns and now an opera producer, and Eva
Andersson Dubin, a doctor and onetime model. He tells people that when a relationship is over
the girlfriend “moves up, not down,” to friendship status.)
Some of the businessmen who dine with him at his home—they include newspaper publisher
Mort Zuckerman, banker Louis Ranieri, Revlon chairman Ronald Perelman, real-estate tycoon
Leon Black, former Microsoft executive Nathan Myhrvold, Tom Pritzker (of Hyatt Hotels), and
real-estate personality Donald Trump—sometimes seem not all that clear as to what he actually
does to earn his millions. Certainly, you won’t find Epstein’s transactions written about on
Bloomberg or talked about in the trading rooms. “The trading desks don’t seem to know him. It’s
unusual for animals that big not to leave any footprints in the snow,” says a high-level
investment manager.

Unlike such fund managers as George Soros and Stanley Druckenmiller, whose client lists and
stock maneuverings act as their calling cards, Epstein keeps all his deals and clients secret, bar
one client: billionaire Leslie Wexner, the respected chairman of Limited Brands. Epstein insists
that ever since he left Bear Stearns in 1981 he has managed money only for billionaires—who
depend on him for discretion. “I was the only person crazy enough, or arrogant enough, or
misplaced enough, to make my limit a billion dollars or more,” he tells people freely. According
to him, the flat fees he receives from his clients, combined with his skill at playing the currency
markets “with very large sums of money,” have afforded him the lifestyle he enjoys today.
Why do billionaires choose him as their trustee? Because the problems of the mega-rich, he tells
people, are different from yours and mine, and his unique philosophy is central to understanding
those problems: “Very few people need any more money when they have a billion dollars. The
key is not to have it do harm more than anything else…. You don’t want to lose your money.”
He has likened his job to that of an architect—more specifically, one who specializes in
remodeling: “I always describe [a billionaire] as someone who started out in a small home and as
he became wealthier had add-ons. He added on another addition, he built a room over the garage
… until you have a house that is usually a mess…. It’s a large house that has been put together
over time where no one could foretell the financial future and their accompanying needs.”
He makes it sound as though his job combines the roles of real-estate agent, accountant, lawyer,
money manager, trustee, and confidant. But, as with Jay Gatsby, myths and rumor swirl around
Epstein.

Here are some of the hard facts about Epstein—ones that he doesn’t mind people knowing: He
grew up middle-class in Brooklyn. His father worked for the city’s parks department. His parents
viewed education as “the way out” for him and his younger brother, Mark, now working in real
estate. Jeffrey started to play the piano—for which he maintains a passion—at five, and he went
to Brooklyn’s Lafayette High School. He was good at mathematics, and in his early 20s he got a
job teaching physics and math at Dalton, the elite Manhattan private school. While there he
began tutoring the son of Bear Stearns chairman Ace Greenberg and was friendly with a
daughter of Greenberg’s. Soon he went to Bear Stearns, where, under the mentorship of both
Greenberg and current Bear Stearns C.E.O. James Cayne, he did well enough to become a
limited partner—a rung beneath full partner. He abruptly departed in 1981 because, he has said,
he wanted to run his own business.
Thereafter the details recede into shadow. A few of the handful of current friends who have
known him since the early 1980s recall that he used to tell them he was a “bounty hunter,”
recovering lost or stolen money for the government or for very rich people. He has a license to
carry a firearm. For the last 15 years, he’s been running his business, J. Epstein & Co.
Since Leslie Wexner appeared in his life—Epstein has said this was in 1986; others say it was in
1989, at the earliest—he has gradually, in a way that has not generally made headlines, come to
be accepted by the Establishment. He’s a member of various commissions and councils: he is on
the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, the New York Academy of
Sciences, and the Institute of International Education.
His current fan club extends to Cayne, Henry Rosovsky, the former dean of Harvard’s Faculty of
Arts and Sciences, and Larry Summers, Harvard’s current president. Harvard law professor Alan
Dershowitz says, “I’m on my 20th book…. The only person outside of my immediate family that
I send drafts to is Jeffrey.” Real-estate developer and philanthropist Marshall Rose, who has
worked with Epstein on projects in New Albany, Ohio, for Wexner, says, “He digests and
decodes the information very rapidly, which is to me terrific because we have shorter meetings.”
Also on the list of admirers are former senator George Mitchell and a gaggle of distinguished
scientists, most of whom Epstein has helped fund in recent years. They include Nobel Prize
winners Gerald Edelman and Murray Gell-Mann, and mathematical biologist Martin Nowak.
When these men describe Epstein, they talk about “energy” and “curiosity,” as well as a love for
theoretical physics that they don’t ordinarily find in laymen. Gell-Mann rather sweetly mentions
that “there are always pretty ladies around” when he goes to dinner chez Epstein, and he’s under
the impression that Epstein’s clients include the Queen of England. Both Nowak and Dershowitz
were thrilled to find themselves shaking the hand of a man named “Andrew” in Epstein’s house.
“Andrew” turned out to be Prince Andrew, who subsequently arranged to sit in the back of
Dershowitz’s law class.
Epstein gets annoyed when anyone suggests that Wexner “made him.” “I had really rich clients
before,” he has said. Yet he does not deny that he and Wexner have a special relationship.
Epstein sees it as a partnership of equals. “People have said it’s like we have one brain between
two of us: each has a side.”

http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey‐epstein‐200303
“I think we both possess the skill of seeing patterns,” says Wexner. “But Jeffrey sees patterns in
politics and financial markets, and I see patterns in lifestyle and fashion trends. My skills are not
in investment strategy, and, as everyone who knows Jeffrey knows, his are not in fashion and
design. We frequently discuss world trends as each of us sees them.”
By the time Epstein met Wexner, the latter was a retail legend who had built a $3 billion
empire—one that now includes Victoria’s Secret, Express, and Bath & Body Works—from
$5,000 lent him by his aunt. “Wexner saw in Jeffrey the type of person who had the potential to
realize his [Jeffrey’s] dreams,” says someone who has worked closely with both men. “He gave
Jeffrey the ball, and Jeffrey hit it out of the park.”
Wexner, through a trust, bought the town house in which Epstein now lives for a reported $13.2
million in 1989. In 1993, Wexner married Abigail Koppel, a 31-year-old lawyer, and the
newlyweds relocated to Ohio; in 1996, Epstein moved into the town house. Public documents
suggest that the house is still owned by the trust that bought it, but Epstein has said that he now
owns the house.
Wexner trusts Epstein so completely that he has assigned him the power of fiduciary over all of
his private trusts and foundations, says a source close to Wexner. In 1992, Epstein even
persuaded Wexner to put him on the board of the Wexner Foundation in place of Wexner’s ailing
mother. Bella Wexner recovered and demanded to be reinstated. Epstein has said they settled by
splitting the foundation in two.
Epstein does not care that he comes between family members. In fact, he sees it as his job. He
tells people, “I am there to represent my client, and if my client needs protecting—sometimes
even from his own family—then it’s often better that people hate me, not the client.”
“You’ve probably heard I’m vicious in my representation of my clients,” he tells people proudly;
Leah Kleman describes his haggling over art prices as something like a scene out of the movie
Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome. Even a former mentor says he’s seen “the dark side” of
Epstein, and a Bear Stearns source recalls a meeting in which Epstein chewed out a team making
a presentation for Wexner as being so brutal as to be “irresponsible.”
One reporter, in fact, received three threats from Epstein while preparing a piece. They were
delivered in a jocular tone, but the message was clear: There will be trouble for your family if I
don’t like the article.
On the other hand, Epstein is clearly very generous with friends. Joe Pagano, an Aspen-based
venture capitalist, who has known Epstein since before his Bear Stearns days, can’t say enough
nice things: “I have a boy who’s dyslexic, and Jeffrey’s gotten close to him over the years….
Jeffrey got him into music. He bought him his first piano. And then as he got to school he had
difficulty … in studying … so Jeffrey got him interested in taking flying lessons.”
Rosa Monckton recalls Epstein telling her that her daughter, Domenica, who suffers from Down
syndrome, needed the sun, and that Rosa should feel free to bring her to his house in Palm Beach
anytime.

Some friends remember that in the late 80s Epstein would offer to upgrade the airline tickets of
good friends by affixing first-class stickers; the only problem was that the stickers turned out to
be unofficial. Sometimes the technique worked, but other times it didn’t, and the unwitting
recipients found themselves exiled to coach. (Epstein has claimed that he paid for the upgrades,
and had no knowledge of the stickers.) Many of those who benefited from Epstein’s largesse
claim that his generosity comes with no strings attached. “I never felt he wanted anything from
me in return,” says one old friend, who received a first-class upgrade.
Epstein is known about town as a man who loves women—lots of them, mostly young. Model
types have been heard saying they are full of gratitude to Epstein for flying them around, and he
is a familiar face to many of the Victoria’s Secret girls. One young woman recalls being
summoned by Ghislaine Maxwell to a concert at Epstein’s town house, where the women
seemed to outnumber the men by far. “These were not women you’d see at Upper East Side
dinners,” the woman recalls. “Many seemed foreign and dressed a little bizarrely.” This same
guest also attended a cocktail party thrown by Maxwell that Prince Andrew attended, which was
filled, she says, with young Russian models. “Some of the guests were horrified,” the woman
says.
“He’s reckless,” says a former business associate, “and he’s gotten more so. Money does that to
you. He’s breaking the oath he made to himself—that he would never do anything that would
expose him in the media. Right now, in the wake of the publicity following his trip with Clinton,
he must be in a very difficult place.”
According to S.E.C. and other legal documents unearthed by VANITY FAIR, Epstein may have
good reason to keep his past cloaked in secrecy: his real mentor, it might seem, was not Leslie
Wexner but Steven Jude Hoffenberg, 57, who, for a few months before the S.E.C. sued to freeze
his assets in 1993, was trying to buy the New York Post. He is currently incarcerated in the
Federal Medical Center in Devens, Massachusetts, serving a 20-year sentence for bilking
investors out of more than $450 million in one of the largest Ponzi schemes in American history.
When Epstein met Hoffenberg in London in the 1980s, the latter was the charismatic, audacious
head of the Towers Financial Corporation, a collection agency that was supposed to buy debts
that people owed to hospitals, banks, and phone companies. But Hoffenberg began using
company funds to pay off earlier investors and service a lavish lifestyle that included a mansion
on Long Island, homes on Manhattan’s Sutton Place and in Florida, and a fleet of cars and
planes.
Hoffenberg and Epstein had much in common. Both were smart and obsessed with making
money. Both were from Brooklyn. According to Hoffenberg, the two men were introduced by
Douglas Leese, a defense contractor. Epstein has said they were introduced by John Mitchell, the
late attorney general.
Epstein had been running International Assets Group Inc. (I.A.G.), a consulting company, out of
his apartment in the Solo building on East 66th Street in New York. Though he has claimed that
he managed money for billionaires only, in a 1989 deposition he testified that he spent 80
percent of his time assisting people recover stolen money from fraudulent brokers and lawyers.

He was also not above entering into risky, tax-sheltered oil and gas deals with much smaller
investors. A lawsuit that Michael Stroll, the former head of Williams Electronics Inc., filed
against Epstein shows that in 1982 I.A.G. received an investment from Stroll of $450,000, which
Epstein put into oil. In 1984 Stroll asked for his money back; four years later he had received
only $10,000. Stroll lost the suit, after Epstein claimed in court, among other things, that the
check for $10,000 was for a horse he’d bought from Stroll. “My net worth never exceeded four
and a half million dollars,” Stroll has said.
Hoffenberg, says a close friend, “really liked Jeffrey…. Jeffrey has a way of getting under your
skin, and he was under Hoffenberg’s.” Also appealing to Hoffenberg were Epstein’s social
connections; they included oil mogul Cece Wang (father of the designer Vera) and Mohan
Murjani, whose clothing company grew into Gloria Vanderbilt Jeans. Epstein lived large even
then. One friend recalls that when he took Canadian heiress Wendy Belzberg on a date he hired a
Rolls-Royce especially for the occasion. (Epstein has claimed he owned it.)
In 1987, Hoffenberg, according to sources, set Epstein up in the offices he still occupies in the
Villard House, on Madison Avenue, across a courtyard from the restaurant Le Cirque.
Hoffenberg hired his new protégé as a consultant at $25,000 a month, and the relationship
flourished. “They traveled everywhere together—on Hoffenberg’s plane, all around the world,
they were always together,” says a source. Hoffenberg has claimed that Epstein confided in him,
saying, for example, that he had left Bear Stearns in 1981 after he was discovered executing
“illegal operations.”
Several of Epstein’s Bear Stearns contemporaries recall that Epstein left the company very
suddenly. Within the company there were rumors also that he was involved in a technical
infringement, and it was thought that the executive committee asked that he resign after his two
supporters, Ace Greenberg and Jimmy Cayne, were outnumbered. Greenberg says he can’t recall
this; Cayne denies it happened, and Epstein has denied it as well. “Jeffrey Epstein left Bear
Stearns of his own volition,” says Cayne. “It was never suggested that he leave by any member
of management, and management never looked into any improprieties by him. Jeffrey said
specifically, ‘I don’t want to work for anybody else. I want to work for myself.’” Yet, this is not
the story that Epstein told to the S.E.C. in 1981 and to lawyers in a 1989 deposition involving a
civil business case in Philadelphia.
In 1981 the S.E.C.’s Jonathan Harris and Robert Blackburn took Epstein’s testimony and that of
other Bear Stearns employees in part of what became a protracted case about insider trading
around a tender offer placed on March 11, 1981, by the Seagram Company Ltd. for St. Joe
Minerals Corp. Ultimately several Italian and Swiss investors were found guilty, including
Italian financier Giuseppe Tome, who had used his relationship with Seagram owner Edgar
Bronfman Sr. to obtain information about the tender offer.
After the tender offer was announced, the S.E.C. began investigating trades involving St. Joe at
Bear Stearns and other firms. Epstein resigned from Bear Stearns on March 12. The S.E.C. was
tipped off that Epstein had information on insider trading at Bear Stearns, and it was therefore
obliged to question him. In his S.E.C. testimony, given on April 1, 1981, Epstein claimed that he
had found “offensive” the way Bear Stearns management had handled a disciplinary action
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-8 Filed 04/16/19 Page 9 of 16
http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey‐epstein‐200303
following its discovery that he had committed a possible “Reg D” violation—evidently he had
lent money to his closest friend. (In the 1989 deposition he said that he’d lent approximately
$20,000 to Warren Eisenstein, to buy stock.) Such an action could have been considered
improper, although Epstein claimed he had not realized this until afterward.
According to Epstein, Bear Stearns management had questioned him about the loan around
March 4. The questioners, Epstein said, were Michael (Mickey) Tarnopol and Alvin Einbender.
In his 1989 deposition Epstein recalled that the partner who had made an “issue” of the matter
was Marvin Davidson. On March 9, Epstein said, he had met with Tarnopol and Einbender
again, and the two partners told him that the executive committee had weighed the offense,
together with previous “carelessness” over expenses, and he would be fined $2,500.
“There was discussion whether, in fact, I had ever put in an airline ticket for someone else and
not myself and I said that it was possible, … since my secretary handles my expenses,” Epstein
told the S.E.C. In his 1989 testimony he stated that the “Reg D” incident had cost him a shot at
partnership that year.
What the S.E.C. seemed to be especially interested in was whether there was a connection
between Epstein’s leaving and the alleged insider trading in St. Joe Minerals by other people at
Bear Stearns:
Q: Sir, are you aware that certain rumors may have been circulating around your firm in
connection with your reasons for leaving the firm?
A: I’m aware that there were many rumors.
Q: What were the rumors you heard?
A: Nothing to do with St. Joe.
Q: Can you relate what you heard?
A: It was having to do with an illicit affair with a secretary.
Q: Have you heard any other rumors suggesting that you had made a presentation or
communication to the Executive Committee concerning alleged improprieties by other members
or employees of Bear Stearns?
A: I, in fact, have heard that rumor, but it’s been from Mr. Harris in our conversation last week.
Q: Have you heard it from anyone else?
A: No.
A little later the interview focuses on James Cayne:
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-8 Filed 04/16/19 Page 10 of 16
http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey‐epstein‐200303
Q: Did you ever hear while you were at Bear Stearns that Mr. Cayne may have trader or insider
information in connection with St. Joe Minerals Corporation?
Q: Did Mr. Cayne ever have any conversation with you about St. Joe Minerals?
Q: Did you happen to overhear any conversations between Mr. Cayne and anyone else regarding
St. Joe Minerals?
And still later in the questioning comes this exchange:
Q: Have you had any type of business dealings with Mr. Cayne?
A: There’s no relationship with Bear Stearns.
Q: Pardon?
A: Other than Bear Stearns, no.
Q: Have you been a participant in any type of business venture with Mr. Cayne?
Q: Do you have any expectation of participating in any business venture with Mr. Cayne?
Q: Have you had any business participations with Mr. Theram?
A: No; nor do I anticipate any.
Q: Mr. Epstein, did anyone at Bear Stearns tell you in words or substance that you should not
divulge anything about St. Joe Minerals to the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission?
Q: Has anyone indicated to you in any way, either directly or indirectly, in words or substance,
that your compensation for this past year or any future monies coming to you from Bear Stearns
will be contingent upon your not divulging information to the Securities and Exchange
Commission?
A: No.
Despite the circumstances of Epstein’s leaving, Bear Stearns agreed to pay him his annual
bonus—which he anticipated as being approximately $100,000.
The S.E.C. never brought any charges against anyone at Bear Stearns for insider trading in St.
Joe, but its questioning seems to indicate that it was skeptical of Epstein’s answers. Some
sources have wondered why, if he was such a big producer at Bear Stearns, he would have given
it up over a mere $2,500 fine.
Certainly the years after Epstein left the firm were not obviously prosperous ones. His luck
didn’t seem to change until he met Hoffenberg.
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-8 Filed 04/16/19 Page 11 of 16
http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey‐epstein‐200303
One of Epstein’s first assignments for Hoffenberg was to mastermind doomed bids to take over
Pan American World Airways in 1987 and Emery Air Freight Corp. in 1988. Hoffenberg
claimed in a 1993 hearing before a grand jury in Illinois that Epstein came up with the idea of
financing these bids through Towers’s acquisition of two ailing Illinois insurance companies,
Associated Life and United Fire. “He was hired by us to work on the securities side of the
insurance companies and Towers Financial, supposedly to make a profit for us and for the
companies,” Hoffenberg reportedly told the grand jury. He also alleged that Epstein was the
“technician,” executing the schemes, although, having no broker’s license, he had to rely on
others to make the trades. Much of Hoffenberg’s subsequent testimony in his criminal case has
proven to be false, and Epstein has claimed he was merely asked how the bids could be
accomplished and has said he had nothing to do with the financing of them. Yet Richard Allen,
the former treasurer of United Fire, recalls seeing Epstein two or three times at the company. He
and another executive say they had direct dealing with Epstein over the finances. And in his
deposition of 1989, Epstein stated that he was the one who executed “all” Hoffenberg’s
instructions to buy and sell the stock. He called it “making the orders.” He could not recall
whether he had chosen the brokers used.
To win approval from the Illinois insurance regulators for Towers’s acquisition of the
companies, Hoffenberg promised to inject $3 million of new capital into them. In fact, in his
grand-jury testimony Hoffenberg claimed that he, his chief operating officer, Mitchell Brater,
and Epstein came up with a scheme to steal $3 million of the insurance companies’ bonds to buy
Pan Am and Emery stock. “Jeffrey Epstein and Mitch Brater arranged the various brokerage
accounts for the bonds to be placed with in New York, and I think one in Chicago, Rodman &
Renshaw,” Hoffenberg reportedly said. Then, said Hoffenberg, while making it appear as though
they were investing the bonds in much safer financial instruments, they used them as collateral to
buy the stock. “Epstein was the person in charge of the transactions, and Mitchell Brater was
assisting him with it in coordination on behalf of the insurance companies’ money,” Hoffenberg
claimed at the time.
At one point, according to Hoffenberg, a broker forged the documents necessary for a $1.8
million check to be written on insurance-company funds. The check was used to buy more stock
in the takeover targets. Meanwhile, in order to throw the insurance regulators off, the $1.8
million was reported as being safely invested in a money-market account.
United Fire’s former chief financial officer Daniel Payton confirms part of Hoffenberg’s
account. He says he recalls making one or two telephone calls to Epstein (at Hoffenberg’s
direction) about the missing bonds. “He said, ‘Oh, yeah, they still exist.’ But we found out later
that he had sold those assets … leveraged them … [and] used some margin account to take some
positions in … Emery and Pan Am,” says Payton.
Epstein’s extraordinary creativity was, according to Hoffenberg, responsible for the purchase by
the insurance companies of a $500,000 bond, with no money down. “Epstein created a great
scheme to purchase a $500,000 treasury bond that would not be shown … [as] margined or
collateralized,” he reportedly told the grand jury. “It looked like it was free and clear but it
actually wasn’t,” he said.
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-8 Filed 04/16/19 Page 12 of 16
http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey‐epstein‐200303
Epstein has denied he ever had any dealings with anyone from the insurance companies. But
Richard Allen says he recalls talking to Epstein at Hoffenberg’s direction and telling him it was
urgent they retrieve the missing bonds for a state examination. According to Allen, Epstein said,
“We’ll get them back.” He had “kind of a flippant attitude,” says Allen. “They never came
back.”
Epstein, according to Hoffenberg, also came up with a scheme to manipulate the price of Emery
Freight stock in an attempt to minimize the losses that occurred when Hoffenberg’s bid went
wrong and the share price began to fall. This was alleged to have involved multiple clients’
accounts controlled by Epstein.
Eventually, in 1991, insurance regulators in Illinois sued Hoffenberg. He settled the case, and
Epstein, who was only a paid consultant, was never deposed or accused of any wrongdoing.
Barry Gross, the attorney who was handling the suit for the regulators, says of Epstein, “He was
very elusive…. It was hard to really track him down. There were a substantial number of checks
for significant dollars that were paid to him, I remember…. He was this character we never got a
handle on. Again we presumed that he was involved with the Pan Am and Emery run that
Hoffenberg made, but we never got a chance to depose him.”
“From the government’s discovery in the main sentencing against Hoffenberg it would seem the
government was perhaps a bit lazy,” says David Lewis, who represented Mitchell Brater. “They
went for what they knew they could get … and that was the fraudulent promissory notes [i.e., the
much larger and unrelated part of Hoffenberg’s fraud, based in New York State]…. What they
couldn’t get, they didn’t bother with.”
Another lawyer involved in the criminal prosecution of Hoffenberg says, “In a criminal
investigation like that, when there is a guilty plea, to be quick and dirty about it, discovery is
always incomplete…. They don’t have to line up witnesses; they don’t have to learn every fact
that might come out on cross-examination.”
Epstein was involved with Hoffenberg in other questionable transactions. Financial records show
that in 1988 Epstein invested $1.6 million in Riddell Sports Inc., a company that manufactures
football helmets. Among his co-investors were the theater mogul Robert Nederlander and
attorney Leonard Toboroff. A source close to this transaction claims that Epstein told
Nederlander and Toboroff that he had raised his share of the money from a Swiss banker, whose
identity they could not be allowed to know. But Hoffenberg has claimed the money came from
him, and Towers’s financial statements for that year show a loan to Epstein of $400,000.
(Epstein has said he can’t remember the details and has disputed the accuracy of the Towers
financial reports.)
Around the same time, Nederlander and Toboroff let Epstein come in with them on a scheme to
make money out of Pennwalt, a Pennsylvania chemical company. The plan was to group together
with two other parties to take a substantial declared position in the stock. According to a source,
Epstein was supposed to help Nederlander and Toboroff raise $15 million. He seemed to fail to
find other investors, say those familiar with the deal. (Epstein has said he was merely an
investor.) He invested $1 million, which he told his co-investors was his own money. But in his
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-8 Filed 04/16/19 Page 13 of 16
http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey‐epstein‐200303
1989 deposition he said that he put in only $300,000 of his own money. Where did the rest come
from? Hoffenberg has said it came from him, in a loan that Nederlander and Toboroff didn’t
know about.
Two things happened that alarmed Nederlander and Toboroff. After the group signaled a
possible takeover, the Pennwalt management threatened to sue the would-be raiders. Epstein was
reluctant initially to give a deposition about his share of the money, telling Toboroff there were
“reasons” he didn’t want to. Then, after the opportunity for new investors was closed, coinvestors
recall Epstein announcing that he’d found one at last: Dick Snyder, then C.E.O. of the
publisher Simon & Schuster, who wanted to put up approximately $500,000. (Neither Epstein
nor Snyder can now recall the investment. Yet in the 1989 deposition Epstein said that he had
recruited Snyder, whom he had met socially, into the deal.)
According to a source, Toboroff and Nederlander told Epstein that Snyder was too late, but,
without their realizing it, Hoffenberg has claimed, Snyder wrote a check to Hoffenberg and
bought out some of his investment. But then Snyder wanted out.
“Nederlander started to get these irate calls from [Snyder,] who wasn’t part of the deal, saying he
was owed all this money,” says someone close to the deal. Toboroff and Nederlander were
baffled.
Eventually, a source close to Hoffenberg says, Hoffenberg paid Snyder off.
Just as Nederlander and Toboroff were growing wary of Epstein, he became increasingly
involved with Leslie Wexner, whom he had met through insurance executive Robert Meister and
his late wife. Epstein has told people that he met Wexner in 1986 in Palm Beach, and that he
won his confidence by persuading him not to invest in the stock market, just as the 1987 crash
was approaching. His story has subsequently changed. When asked if Wexner knew about his
connection to Hoffenberg, Epstein said that he began working for Wexner in 1989, and that “it
was certainly not the same time.”
Wherever and whenever it was that Epstein and Wexner actually met, there was an immediate
and strong personal chemistry. Wexner says he thinks Epstein is “very smart with a combination
of excellent judgment and unusually high standards. Also, he is always a most loyal friend.”
Sources say Epstein proved that he could be useful to Wexner as well, with “fresh” ideas about
investments. “Wexner had a couple of bad investments, and Jeffrey cleaned those up right
away,” says a former associate of Epstein’s.
Before he signed on with Wexner, Epstein had several meetings with Harold Levin, then head of
Wexner Investments, in which he enunciated ideas about currencies that Levin found
incomprehensible. “In fact,” says someone who used to work very closely with Wexner, “almost
everyone at the Limited wondered who Epstein was; he literally came out of nowhere.”
“Everyone was mystified as to what his appeal was,” says Robert Morosky, a former vicechairman
of the Limited.
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-8 Filed 04/16/19 Page 14 of 16
http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey‐epstein‐200303
Much of Epstein’s work is related to cleaning up, tightening budgets, and efficiencies. One
person who worked for Wexner and who saw a contract drawn up between the two men says
Epstein is involved in “everything, not just a little here, a little there. Everything!” In addition, he
says, “Wexner likes having a hatchet man…. Whenever there is dirty work to be done he’d stick
Jeffrey on it…. He has a reputation for being ruthless but he gets the job done.”
Epstein has evidently been asked to fire personal-staff members when needed. “He was that
mysterious person that everyone was scared to death of,” says a former employee.
Meanwhile, he is also less than popular with some people outside Wexner’s company with
whom he now deals. “He ‘inserted’ himself into the construction process of Leslie Wexner’s
yacht…. That resulted in litigation down the road between Mr. Wexner and the shipyard that
eventually built the vessel,” says Lars Forsberg, a lawyer whose firm at the time, Dickerson and
Reily, was hired to deal with litigation stemming from the construction of Wexner’s Limitless—
at 315 feet, one of the largest private yachts in the world. Evidently, Epstein stalled on paying
Dickerson and Reily for its work. “It’s probably once or twice in my legal career that I’ve had to
sue a client for payment of services that he’d requested and we’d performed … without issue on
the performance,” says Forsberg. In the end the matter was settled, but Epstein claims he now
has no recollection of it.
The incident is one of a number of disputes Epstein has become embroiled in. Some are for sums
so tiny as to be baffling; for instance, Epstein sued investment adviser Herbert Glass, who sold
him the Palm Beach house in 1990, for $13,444—Epstein claimed this was owed him for
furnishings removed by Glass.
In 1998 the U.S. Attorney’s Office sued Epstein for illegally subletting the former home of the
deputy consul general of Iran to attorney Ivan Fisher and others. Epstein paid $15,000 a month in
rent to the State Department, but he charged Fisher and his colleagues $20,000. Though the exact
terms of the agreement are sealed, the court ruled against Epstein.
Wexner offers some insight into his friend’s combative style. “Many times people confuse
winning and losing,” Wexner says. “Jeffrey has the unusual quality of knowing when he is
winning. Whether in conversations or negotiations, he always stands back and lets the other
person determine the style and manner of the conversation or negotiation. And then he responds
in their style. Jeffrey sees it in chivalrous terms. He does not pick a fight, but if there is a fight,
he will let you choose your weapon.”
One case is rather more serious. Currently, Citibank is suing Epstein for defaulting on loans from
its private-banking arm for $20 million. Epstein claims that Citibank “fraudulently induced” him
into borrowing the money for investments. Citibank disputes this charge.
The legal papers for another case offer a rare window into Epstein’s finances. In 1995, Epstein
stopped paying rent to his landlord, the nonprofit Municipal Arts Society, for his office in the
Villard House. He claimed that they were breaking the terms of the lease by not letting his staff
in at night. The case was eventually settled. However, one of the papers filed in this dispute is
Epstein’s financial statement for 1988, in which he claimed to be worth $20 million. He listed
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-8 Filed 04/16/19 Page 15 of 16
http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2003/03/jeffrey‐epstein‐200303
that he owned $7 million in securities, $1 million in cash, zero in residential property (although
he told sources that he had already bought the home in Palm Beach), and $11 million in other
assets, including his investment in Riddell. A co-investor in Riddell says: “The company had
been bought with a huge amount of debt, and it wasn’t public, so it was meaningless to attach a
figure like that to it … the price it cost was about $1.2 million.” The co-investors bought out
Epstein’s share in Riddell in 1995 for approximately $3 million. At that time, when Epstein was
asked, as a routine matter, to sign a paper guaranteeing he had access to a few million dollars in
case of any subsequent disputes over the sale price, Wexner signed for him. Epstein has
explained that this was because the co-investors wanted an indemnity against being sued by
Wexner. One of the investors calls this “bullshit.”
Epstein’s appointment to the board of New York’s Rockefeller University in 2000 brought him
into greater social prominence. Boasting such social names as Nancy Kissinger, Brooke Astor,
and Robert Bass, the board also includes such pre-eminent scientists as Nobel laureate Joseph
Goldstein. “Epstein was thrilled to be elected,” says someone who knows him.
After one term Epstein resigned. According to New York magazine, this was because he didn’t
like to wear a suit to meetings. A spokesperson for the Rockefeller board says Epstein left
because he had insufficient time to commit; a board member recalls that he was “arrogant” and
“not a good fit.” The spokesperson admits that it is “infrequent” for board members not to be
renominated after only one term.
Still, the recent spate of publicity Epstein has inspired does not seem to have fazed him. In
November he was spotted in the front row of the Victoria’s Secret fashion show at New York’s
Lexington Avenue Armory; around the same time the usual coterie of friends and beautiful
women were whisked off to Little St. James (which he tells people has been renamed Little St.
Jeff) for a long weekend.
Thanks to Epstein’s introductions, says Martin Nowak, the biologist finds himself moving from
Princeton to Harvard, where he is assuming the joint position of professor of mathematics and
professor of biology. Epstein has pledged at least $25 million to Harvard to create the Epstein
Program for Mathematical Biology and Evolutionary Dynamics, and Epstein will have an office
at the university. The program will be dedicated to searching for nature’s algorithms, a pursuit
that is a specialty of Nowak’s. For Epstein this must be the summit of everything he has worked
toward: he has been seen proudly displaying Harvard president Larry Summers’s letter of
commitment as if he can’t quite believe it is real. He says he was reluctant to have his name
attached to the program, but Summers persuaded him. He rang his mentor Wexner about it, and
Wexner told him it was all right.
An insatiable, restless soul, always on the move, Epstein builds a tremendous amount of
downtime into his hectic work schedule. Yet there is something almost programmed about his
relaxation: it’s as if even pleasure has to be measured in terms of self-improvement. Nowak says
that, when he goes to stay with Epstein in the Caribbean, they’ll get up at six and, as the sun
rises, have three-hour conversations about theoretical physics. “Then he’ll go off and do some
work, re-appear, and we’ll talk some more.”

Another person who went to the island with Epstein, Maxwell, and several beautiful women
remembers that the women “sat around one night teasing him about the kinds of grasping women
who might want to date him. He was amused by the idea…. He’s like a king in his own world.”
Many people comment there is something innocent, almost childlike about Jeffrey Epstein. They
see this as refreshing, given the sophistication of his surroundings. Alan Dershowitz says that, as
he was getting to know Epstein, his wife asked him if he would still be close to him if Epstein
suddenly filed for bankruptcy. Dershowitz says he replied, “Absolutely. I would be as interested
in him as a friend if we had hamburgers on the boardwalk in Coney Island and talked about his
ideas.”

Alan Dershowitz says he's still advising Jeffrey Epstein
Alan Dershowitz still provides legal advice to serial pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, he confirmed to Axios.
What he's saying: He has called me a couple of times about legal issues, because I'm still technically
his lawyer, Dershowitz told me in a phone interview on Saturday. But I haven't had any social, or any
other kind of contact. ... You never stop being a person's lawyer.
Background: Dershowitz helped Epstein get a sweetheart plea deal from then-U.S. Attorney
Alexander Acosta (now Donald Trump's labor secretary and a rumored long-shot contender for attorney
general).
A bombshell Miami Herald investigative series last week highlighted for the first time the extent of
Epstein's alleged crimes and the soft treatment he received from federal prosecutors.
The Palm Beach multimillionaire would serve just 13 months in the county jail, but the deal —
called a non-prosecution agreement — essentially shut down an ongoing FBI probe into whether
there were more victims and other powerful people who took part in Epstein’s sex crimes,
according to a Miami Herald examination of thousands of emails, court documents and FBI
records.

Dozens of women alleged that Epstein molested and raped them when they were underaged using a
sophisticated human trafficking network. A civil trial is scheduled to begin on Tuesday in Palm Beach
County that may finally let these women tell their stories in court.
Behind the scenes: While he was allegedly raping teenage girls, Epstein cultivated cozy relationships
with America's elites.
Bill Clinton flew on Epstein's plane, nicknamed the Lolita Express, numerous times, according to
flight logs.
And Donald Trump, in a profile with New York magazine written several years before the police
caught up with Epstein, praised his friend as a terrific guy. It is even said that he likes beautiful
women as much as I do, Trump said of Epstein, and many of them are on the younger side.
Dershowitz was also friendly with Epstein before the broader public knew he was a pedophile.
Dershowitz confirmed to me that he received a massage at Epstein's Palm Beach home, adding
that the woman who provided it was of legal age.
What happened was I, um, he lent us, this was well before any of this thing came out, he lent us
his house once. And I was there, my grandchildren were there, my daughter was there, and we all
got massages.
And, um, it was therapeutic. I had a therapeutic massage with an old old Russian, but I never
never ... and that was part of when we had his house for about a week during I think it was
Christmas vacation.
Believe me, if I had known that anything improper had ever taken place in that house, I never
would have allowed my children, my grandchildren, my wife, my daughter-in-law, my son, to have
spent time there. I can tell you categorically there were no inappropriate pictures, no
inappropriate anythings. It was like any other house.
One of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Roberts, has claimed Dershowitz had sex with her when she was
underage. Dershowitz has denied the allegation and told the Miami Herald the story was 100 percent
flatly categorically made-up so she could get money.

LETTER
Jeffrey Epstein’s
Attorneys: A Fair
Plea Deal
The attorneys for a man accused of sexual abuse of young women defend the
prosecutors’ decision to drop federal charges against him.
March 4, 2019
To the Editor:
Re “The Cowardly Labor Secretary” (editorial, March 3):
Your editorial’s conclusions are in profound conflict with the reality as we, Jeffrey Epstein’s
current and former lawyers, knew it.
When he was United States attorney for the Southern District of Florida in 2007, Alexander
Acosta, the current labor secretary, oversaw a plea deal for Mr. Epstein involving charges of
solicitation of prostitution involving young women. Your underlying premise is that Mr. Acosta
had capitulated and not filed federal charges because Mr. Epstein had a “high-priced defense
team.”
This was categorically denied by the Southern District’s then first assistant, Jeffrey H. Sloman, in
an Op-Ed article in The Miami Herald on Feb. 15. Mr. Sloman correctly represented the existence
of “significant legal impediments to [federally] prosecuting” what was a quintessentially state case.
He also correctly represented that the government had achieved its principal objectives — a felony
plea, incarceration, millions of dollars in restitution and monetary settlements, and lifetime sex
offender registration — through its agreement with Mr. Epstein. That agreement was reviewed at
multiple levels of the Justice Department. An agreement rather than a trial is how over 97
percent of federal cases get resolved, through negotiations by two teams of experienced
professionals. The case lacked the credible and compelling proof that is required by federal
criminal statutes.
That the guilty plea was required in a state, not federal, court reflected the absence of evidence
that Mr. Epstein used the internet, traveled to a location away from his home for the purpose of
having illegal sex, commercially trafficked women to others, engaged in force, fraud or coercion,
used drugs or alcohol to entice young women who came to his house to exchange sexual massages
for money, possessed child pornography or in other ways violated federal law.

The number of young women involved in the investigation has been vastly exaggerated, there was
no “international sex-trafficking operation” and there was never evidence that Mr. Epstein “hosted
sex parties” at his home.

Prof. Dershowitz, Tell Me How You
Really Feel
Harvard's legendary law professor chats with the Careerist about the recent sex allegations, his enemies and the
cesspool.
By Vivia Chen | January 15, 2015 at 06:19 PM | Originally published on The American Lawyer
(Alan Dershowitz)
Alan Dershowitz, arguably the most famous—and maybe infamous—law professor in the
land, wants to set the record straight. When he heard that I was writing about his
relationship with billionaire Jeffrey Epstein and the related allegation that Dershowitz
engaged in sex with a minor, he tracked me down to tell his side of the story.
The backdrop: Dershowitz was part of a legal team that had negotiated a plea deal in
2008 in which Epstein pleaded guilty to felony charges in Florida for soliciting prostitution
from a minor. Epstein served 13 months in prison but was spared federal charges under
the deal. Last December, lawyers Bradley Edwards and Paul Cassellfiled suit against
the U.S. government, arguing that the plea deal violated the rights of Epstein’s alleged
sex victims; the suit also alleges that Dershowitz had sex with one of the victims when
she was under age. Dershowitz has denied all the allegations, and Edwards and Cassell
have filed a defamation suit against Dershowitz for calling them liars.
The following are excerpts from my two phone conversations with Dershowitz:
From what I’ve read, your relationship with Epstein seemed chummy. You
socialized with him and you and your family stayed at his various homes. Isn’t it a
bad idea for a lawyer to be so close to a notorious client?
Let me tell you how I met him. I was introduced to him by Lady de Rothschild as an
academic colleague. He was friendly with Larry Summers . . . He was in the process of
contributing $50 million to Harvard for evolutionary biology.
So Epstein was friendly with all sorts of Harvard muckety-mucks.

4/8/2019 Prof. Dershowitz, Tell Me How You Really Feel | Law.com
The fact that he was giving money didn’t hurt. We went to events that he was involved in
but none of us suspected that he had another side until later. Jeffrey loved academics.
My conversations with him were only about academic subjects. We never discussed
females or our social life.
Did your relationship change with Epstein when you took him on as a client?
Virtually all my social contact with him was of an academic nature, and it was prior to the
time he was indicted. My relationship with him was entirely professional. It is a total bum
rap to say that I “cavorted” with him or was “chummy” with him. I teach my students
never, never get too close to clients—and certainly don’t do anything improper with them.
The suit says that Jane Doe No. 3 was forced to have sex with you, Prince Andrew
and “many other powerful men,” including unnamed politicians, foreign presidents
and world leaders. Why were you and the Prince singled out by name?
They want to void the plea agreement and needed to find a lawyer who knew Epstein
before [the indictment], and had been on his island, his home in New Mexico, Palm
Beach. I fit the bill. It was lawyer profiling.
And the Prince?
They claimed that Prince Andrew was using his influence to get Epstein a better deal with
the government. What’s more laughable than suggesting that the U.S. Attorney would
listen to the Prince to go easy on Epstein!
Why bother responding if you think the allegations are so outrageous? Why not
just let the facts come out during the legal process?
I have to respond to everything. That’s the way I am. Imagine having an unblemished
personal life then reading graffiti scrawled on the bathroom door that gets picked up in
every paper based on the assertions of a woman who’s a serial liar.
Brad Edwards, one of the lawyers bringing this suit, has a history of legal
entanglement with Epstein, as does his former partner Scott Rothstein, who’s now
in prison for his role in a Ponzi scheme. But the other lawyer in this case, Paul
Cassell, is a former federal judge and a law professor. Why is he getting involved?
Everyone is shocked that he would be part of this. I think he’s always hated me because
I’m his opposite. I’m the conventional liberal he hates: I’m against the death penalty, I’m
pro abortion rights, pro gun control.
Seems risky to bring a lawsuit for just ideological differences.
No one can understand Cassell’s motive. Either he will be disbarred or I will be. And if I
knowingly had sex with a sex slave then I would deserve disbarment.
What about the reaction? Do you feel you’ve been treated fairly by the press and
the public?
I’ve been treated particularly harshly by lawyers and law professors. They are so quick to
say that I might be guilty. They’re getting too much pleasure out of this. There’s a dose of
schadenfreude.
Why do you think people like getting you upset?
I’m controversial and more famous than they are. There’s a lot of jealousy.
https://www.law.com/almID/1202715316005/Prof-Dershowitz-Tell-Me-How-You-Really-Feel/?slreturn=20190308174659 2/3

4/8/2019 Prof. Dershowitz, Tell Me How You Really Feel | Law.com
I gather you’re talking about legal academia.
Yes, it’s a cesspool of jealousy. People in it lack courage.
But you’re no stranger to harsh criticism. People weren’t exactly nominating you
for a justice award for getting O.J. Simpson and Claus von Bulow off the hook.
Some of the criticisms against me have been just. I’m a tough lawyer. But charging me
with one of the most heinous crimes is on a different level. I’ve never been attacked like
this. I don’t know any lawyer or professor who’s had these accusations waged against
them. It’s worse than what Clarence Darrow had to face.
You retired from Harvard Law School a year ago. Did you expect so much
excitement at this stage of your career?
This is an absolute shock. I’m living my little life here [in Florida, New York and Martha's
Vineyard]. I lead a boring life. I’ve been married to the same woman for 28 years. She
goes with me everywhere. People know that I won’t argue a case or give a speech
unless my wife travels with me. This is not the profile of someone who screws around.
You take all this very, very personally, don’t you?
Wouldn’t you? I’ve got two grandchildren in college and they are reading this about me.
This is the fight of my life.
Note: We have been in contact with Edwards and Cassell and hope to get their sides of
the story soon.

An Epstein sex case is settled;
Dershowitz denies latest
allegation
BY JULIE K. BROWN
DECEMBER 19, 2018 8:30 PM, UPDATED DECEMBER 27, 2018 7:55 AM
Accused sex traffickers Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell have settled a federal civil lawsuit
filed by a woman who says she was ordered under threat of violence to have sex with them and
other influential individuals when she was in her early 20s, sources confirmed Wednesday.
Sarah Ransome, who now lives in Barcelona, claimed that she was recruited and trafficked for
sex by the pair in 2006 and 2007 — at the same time that Epstein, a wealthy New York hedge
fund manager, was under federal investigation for molesting dozens of underage girls at his
Palm Beach mansion.
Women who say they were victims of sexual abuse at the hands of Palm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein
want a judge to throw out his lenient plea deal. AP
According to a recent court transcript, among those people Ransome claims she was directed to
have sex with was Epstein’s lawyer, Alan Dershowitz, who helped negotiate a controversial plea

Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-16 Filed 04/16/19 Page 3 of 6
deal that gave the eccentric multimillionaire — and co-conspirators employed by Epstein —
federal immunity in 2008.
Dershowitz, 80, told the Miami Herald that he has never met Ransome nor has he ever had sex
with her. He accused Ransome’s attorney, powerhouse lawyer David Boies, of inventing the
story and using her and another woman, Virginia Roberts, to frame him. Roberts asserted in a
federal court affidavit in 2015 that Epstein forced her to have sex with Dershowitz when she was
16 years old.
“I am the victim. David Boies and these women are the perpetrators,’’ Dershowitz said. “They
have willfully and deliberately concocted stories in order to make money — millions and
millions of dollars. And I will not rest until the entire story comes out,’’ said Dershowitz, a
professor at Harvard Law School and frequent Fox news guest commentator.
Nowhere in the court case or the transcript does Ransome or anyone else allege that Ransome
had sex with Dershowitz — only that she was directed to.
The Ransome settlement, which is confidential, comes two weeks after Epstein settled another
lawsuit in Palm Beach, filed by an attorney who represented several women who said they were
coerced into sex acts with Epstein when they were underage. As part of the settlement, Epstein,
65, issued an apology to Fort Lauderdale attorney Bradley Edwards, admitting that he leveled
false claims in a lawsuit as part of an effort to intimidate Edwards into abandoning his
aggressive advocacy for the women, who are now in their late 20s and early 30s.
The developments follow a series of stories published by the Miami Herald in late November
that detailed how state and federal prosecutors worked with Epstein’s lawyers to conceal the
extent of Epstein’s crimes, and secretly negotiated an unusual plea agreement that allowed him
to escape federal sex trafficking charges that could have sent him to prison for life. The
agreement, by design, was kept from his victims so that they could not appear at his sentencing.
Last week, more than two dozen lawmakers in Washington demanded a federal investigation
into that plea deal, which was negotiated, signed and sealed by former Miami U.S. Attorney
Alexander Acosta, now President Donald Trump’s secretary of labor.
Acosta has not commented on the Herald story or on the calls
for a probe into how he handled the Epstein case.
This week, a decade after defending Epstein, Dershowitz once
again found himself in the spotlight amid the new allegations,
mentioned briefly in a court filing on Nov. 28, and first
reported on Tuesday by the New York Daily News.
During a Nov. 7 hearing, Maxwell’s lawyer, Laura Menninger,
mentioned Dershowitz’s name as among those “third parties’’
that Ransome claims she was instructed to have sex with,
according to a transcript of the hearing obtained by the Herald.
On Tuesday, after the Daily News published its story,
Dershowitz lashed out in dozens of posts on Twitter,
denouncing Ransome as “delusional’’ and claiming that her
lawyer, Boies, was retaliating against him because Dershowitz
had filed a bar complaint against him.
Alan Dershowitz says he has never met

“Attorney David Boies threatened that unless I withdrew a bar
complaint I had filed against him for falsely accusing me of
sexual misconduct, he would find another woman to accuse me of similar misconduct. He has
https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article223315075.html

now found an unbalanced woman who has delusions of having sex tapes of Donald Trump,
Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton and other prominent figures,’’ Dershowitz said in a tweet.
Boies, best known for arguing on behalf of Vice President Al Gore in the 2000 Florida election
recount, responded in an interview with the Herald:
“[Dershowitz’s] charges are absurd. Either he has become totally unhinged or he thinks that if
he says things that are loud enough and crazy enough it will distract attention from what he has
done. There is no support — none — for what he says.’’
Ransome claimed that, in her early 20s, she was recruited to work as a masseuse for Epstein
who, in exchange, promised he would help her get into fashion design in New York, according to
her civil lawsuit, filed in January 2017. Epstein and Maxwell then kept her passport and
threatened to ruin her life and physically harm her if she didn’t have sex with them and others
in 2006 and 2007, Ransome said in the complaint.
The complaint alleges that this all occurred at the same time as Epstein’s lawyers were
negotiating with Acosta and other federal prosecutors for a deal to avoid federal sex trafficking
charges in connection with a scheme in which he lured underprivileged girls, mostly 13 to 16, to
his home in Palm Beach under the pretense that he would pay them $200 to $300 for massages.
Instead, police in Palm Beach found that he had been molesting and sexually abusing dozens of
girls between 2001 and 2007.

Epstein associate Guislaine Maxwell stands in the background. Roberts claims she
was effectively used as a sex slave by Epstein. In that capacity she had sex with
the prince, Roberts says. The prince denied that. COURTESY OF VIRGINIA ROBERTS
Under the plea deal, known as a non-prosecution agreement, Epstein was allowed to plead
guilty in state court to two prostitution charges. He served 13 months in a private wing of the
Palm Beach County jail, where he was given liberal work release privileges. The deal also
quashed an FBI investigation into whether Epstein was operating an international sex
trafficking organization, the Herald found as part of its yearlong investigation.
“Even as [Epstein, Maxwell and other defendants] and their attorneys were busy arguing
Epstein’s innocence and publicly defaming his victims as liars...defendants merely changed
their location’’ from Palm Beach to “other places in the U.S. [including the Southern District of
New York] and abroad and brought them to Epstein’s mansion in New York City and his private
island in the Virgin Islands,’’ Ransome’s complaint alleged.
https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article223315075.html
Case 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-16 Filed 04/16/19 Page 5 of 6
Dershowitz, in interviews with the Herald, and in recent public statements, said he has never
met Ransome. He also said she initially tried to interest the New York Post in her story, but a
reporter whom he said he spoke with told him Ransome was not credible. He said he has a trove
of emails between Ransome and the reporter that prove she is a “lunatic.’’
“There are hundreds of emails in which she claimed to have sex with everybody in the world and
also claimed she has video of Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and others having sex
with underage girls — but she never ever accused me in these emails,’’ Dershowitz said.
The emails are under seal, he said, and therefore cannot be made public. Dershowitz said he has
asked the court to unseal them but his efforts thus far have been unsuccessful.
In the recent court transcript, however, it is Maxwell’s attorney, Laura Menninger — not
Ransome or her attorneys — who named Dershowitz.
“[Ransome] has alleged not only that my client [Maxwell] ran a sex trafficking organization but
she claims also that she was directed by my client and the Epstein defendants to have sex with
third parties, including Alan Dershowitz, for example,’’ Menninger said. “And so to the extent
my client or Mr. Dershowitz or anyone else is going to be asked about their private sexual
activity, I believe that would implicate their privacy rights...’’
Roberts, who now lives in Australia, said that Epstein ordered her to have sex with Dershowitz
six times, according to a 2015 affidavit, which was filed in connection with an unrelated Epstein
federal lawsuit.
At that time, Dershowitz launched a media blitz on TV asserting that Roberts made up the story.
He also called for Roberts’ lawyers — Edwards and University of Utah law professor Paul Cassell
— to be disbarred. The lawyers sued Dershowitz for defamation, and the case was settled last
year.
Dershowitz publicly declared he was vindicated after a federal judge ordered Roberts’ affidavit
stricken from the court record. But the judge did not address the veracity of her sexual
misconduct claims; he instead ruled that the affidavit was misplaced in a case not involving
Dershowitz.
Boies, whose firm represented Roberts pro bono, addressed Dershowitz’s longstanding
contention that he had been exonerated.
“Anytime in a lawsuit where you were the defendant and you paid the plaintiff $900,000 to
settle it — that’s a strange kind of vindication,’’ Boies said, asserting that Dershowitz paid that
amount as part of the defamation settlement with Edwards and Cassell.
In 2016, Dershowitz released a statement following what he said was “an independent
investigation’’ that had been conducted by former FBI Director Louis Freeh, who is now a
private consultant.
“Our investigation found no evidence to support the accusations of sexual misconduct against
Professor Dershowitz. In fact, in several instances, the evidence directly contradicted the
accusations made against him,’’ Freeh wrote.
Most of the court records in the Roberts case are sealed. In February, the Miami Herald filed a
motion in the Southern District of New York, seeking access to documents. The motion, which
was not opposed by Roberts, could shed more light on the full scope of Epstein’s crimes and
who was involved.

"
IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013364.txt,"8. In the Spring of 2009 (approximately April), I joined the law firm of Rothstein,
Rosenfeldt and Adler, P.A. (“RRA”). I brought my existing clients with me when I
joined RRA, including L.M., E.W., and Jane Doe. When I joined the firm, I was not
aware that Scott Rothstein was running a Ponzi scheme at RRA. Had I known such a
Ponzi scheme was in place, I would never have joined RRA.

9. I am now aware that it has been alleged that Scott Rothstein made fraudulent
presentations to investors about the lawsuiis that I had filed on behalf of my clients
against Epstein and that it has been alleged that these lawsuits were used to fraudulently
lure investors into Rothstein’s Ponzi scheme. I never met a single investor, had no part
in any such presentations and had no knowledge any such fraud was occurring. If these
allegations are true, I had no knowledge that any such fraudulent presentations were
occurring and no knowledge of any such improper use of the case files.

10. Epstein’s Complaint against me alleges that Rothstein made false statements about
cases filed against Epstein, i.c., that RRA had 50 anonymous females who had filed suit
against Epstein; that Rothstein sold an interest in personal injury lawsuits, reached
agreements to share attorneys fees with non-lawyers, paid clients “up front” money; and
that he used the judicial process to further his Ponzi scheme. If Rothstein did any of
these things, I had no knowledge of his actions. Because I maintained close contact
with my clients, EW, LM and Jane Doe, and Scott Rothstein never met any of them, I
know for certain that none of my clients were paid “up front’ money by anyone.

11. Epstein alleges that I attempted to take the depositions of his “high profile friends and
acquaintances” for no legitimate litigation purpose. This is untrue, as all of my actions
im representing L.M., E.W., and Jane Doe were aimed at providing them effective
representation in their civil suits, With regard to Epstein’s friends, through documents
and information obtained in discovery and other means of investigation, I learned that
Epstein was sexually molesting minor girls on a daily basis and had been for many
years. I also learned the unsurprising fact that he was molesting the girls in the privacy
of his mansion in West Palm Beach, meaning that locating witnesses to corroborate
their testimony would be difficult to find. I also learned, from the course of the
litigation, that Epstein and his lawyers were constantly attacking the credibility of the
girls, that Epstein’s employees were all represented by lawyers who apparently were
paid for (directly or indirectly) by Epstein, that co-conspirators whose representation
was also apparently paid for by Epstein were all taking the Fifth (like Epstein) rather
than provide information in discovery. For example, I was given reason to believe that
Sarah Kellen, Larry Visoski, Larry Harrison, David Rogers, Louella Rabuyo, Nadia
Marcinkova, Ghislaine Maxwell, Mark Epstein, and Janusz Banasiak all had lawyers
paid for by Epstein. Because Epstein and the co-conspirators in his child molestation
criminal enterprise blocked normal discovery avenues, I needed to search for other
ordinary approaches to strengthen the cases of my clients. Consistent with my training
and experience, these other ordinary approaches included finding other witnesses who

totally owned by the government. The government today has made a decision requiring that any
industry should be linked to local content (i.e. | will not buy from you unless you tell me how much you
give me local content). There are types of industries, low-sensitive technology industries and in this case
other countries do not have the embarrassment of being transferred to you 100% inside Saudi Arabia,
such as light weapons or ammunitions or what can be included under it or spare parts or structures, etc.
And there are a medium-sensitive technology industries, some countries have a certain sensitivity, we
try to get out of the deal a certain percentage for the local content, and sometimes we manage to reach
70% of the local content, sometimes 50%, and sometimes 20%. There are also complex industries that
countries refuse to transfer technology to Saudi Arabia. Here, we stipulate that the main materials are
through Saudi Arabia, which has an indirect impact on the local content inside Saudi Arabia, but the
condition in the competent authorities in Saudi Arabia today is that no weapon deal without local
content targeting 100 % of industry transfer. If we do not succeed we must end up in 2030 with 50%
local content. This means that from 50% (S 70 billion) will be spent inside Saudi Arabia in 2030 and will
gradually increase. His Highness has pointed out that today there is a range of armament deals will be
announced in the coming period. In each deal, we will know how much the local content is, and how
many job opportunities will be provided by it. Arming is the largest item in the local content. The second
item is the automotive industry, where car purchases by the Saudis are almost S$ 30 billion a year,
sometimes higher than and sometimes less than. The positive element is that $ 13 billion of these
purchases are purchases for the Saudi government and we can start with the first stage is to provide the
needs of the Saudi government through Saudi manufacturing companies that the Saudi government is
contributing to. This will bring us 40% to 43% in 2030 in the automotive industry.

* Will there be a localization of the automotive industry?

- We will not try to offer goods to the citizen in the next ten years as cars, it will be very difficult to
compete in prices and also to convince him of the quality required, but we can ensure that these deals
for the government in exchange for creating this industry within Saudi Arabia, and the third most
important item of the local content is entertainment and tourism (22 billion dollars a year out of Saudi
Arabia on entertainment and tourism) This is the most difficult item because its decision in full to the
Saudi citizen and there is no part of the purchases with the Saudi government, it is very difficult that you
invest in an investment convince the Saudi citizen that instead of spending this money outside Saudi
Arabia to spend it inside Saudi Arabia. Also target 50% in 2030. Under the local content, there are too
many items, this (230 billion US dollars) of which we are targeting US $ 115 billion to be spent annually
in Saudi Arabia and increasing gradually after 2030. Hence, until reaching 2030, these are all challenges
and profitability in it are not as expected or as required and the risk is very high, no one will invest in it
except the Public Investment Fund so that this sector succeeds and then privatize and sell in the stock
market then Companies are listed in the stock market and the fund starts to recover its expenses and
enters into another chance. This is the second sector targeted by the Public Investment Fund after
mining. The third sector targeted by the Public Investment Fund is the logistics sector. We have three
very large logistics opportunities and we operate very strongly. The most important opportunity is the
Red Sea. 13% of the world trade passes through the Red Sea and Saudi Arabia provides nothing at this
field (zero services), and here are huge opportunities to work along the Red Sea for many exports and
imports of countries. We began today to work with many countries since the recent time headed by

remain outside to deal with the concierges or security guards or any other
interference, and to command and co-ordinate. We’d leave the same way we
came in, by sea.

Dado nodded. I found out later that he’d asked the same question of Manno,
who had proposed a classic regular-army raid. They would block the road with
ten armed paratroopers on each end with the aim of holding off resistance, while
another two dozen went in to the apartments and attacked. I could only assume
Dado concluded that this almost certainly wouldn’t work, at least not without
major trouble. It would certainly forfeit any chance of surprise.

“The mission is yours,” he said. “Manno will be in overall command,
offshore. Because we’re also planning to hit several other targets.”

The reason for the urgent summons was that the Mossad had confirmed all
three Palestinians would be in their apartments in 10 days’ time. Everyone
involved realized that — given its complexity, the obvious risks, and the
inevitable unknowns — the operation could well go wrong. In fact, one reason
for Dado’s “other targets” was to ensure that if it did, there would be successes
elsewhere to provide a credible justification for having sent Israeli forces into
Beirut. As we received further intelligence, new obstacles had to be factored in.
The main one was the presence of a gendarmerie, a Lebanese police post, at the
bottom end of the street, only 500 feet or so from the apartments. And we would
be operating in a crowded, up-market residential area. We could only hope that
at the hour we struck, most people would be in bed. Or out partying. This was,
after all, pre-civil war Beirut, the “Paris of the Middle East’.

In the years since, an extraordinary array of stories has grown up around the
sayeret’s final and best-known mission during my term as commander,
culminating in the dramatic version in Stephen Spielberg’s movie Munich. |
remember reading in one earlier book, otherwise surprisingly accurate, about
our five weeks of intensive training. Even the full 10 days which I thought we’d
been given would have been a bonus. In fact, we had half that as a full team,
since our Mossad drivers, European-born Israelis, had to make their way
through Paris to Beirut as tourists, rent the cars and scout out our route from the
seashore to Rue Verdun.

There were four other operations planned alongside ours: three by paratroop
units and one by the Shayetet 13 SEALs, against a series of Fatah and
Democratic Front installations. Though all of them, like ours, would need help

Young woman: Good judgment.

Interviewer: Any specifics?

Young woman: I think she would control the out-of-control
spending.

Young woman: I think she would acknowledge the system of
government in the United States rather than focus on the
administration of czars.

Interviewer: Yeah, and what is your problem with czars?

Young woman: I’m an American and we don’t have czars in
America.

Here again, we have a juxtaposition of beliefs based on no actual evi-
dence or reality. I don’t know what this woman has heard about czars,
but whatever it is, it misses the point. Could we teach this woman to
be on point—to say meaningful things based on actual evidence? Not
now, I fear, but it is my contention that we could have done so at some
point in her life. School has failed her and she seems, to anyone listen-
ing, to be stupid. But she is not really stupid; she is just talking stu-
pidly because she hasn’t been challenged to behave in any other way.
Here is another:

Middle-aged woman: Governor of Alaska is the only one that has
top security.

Interviewer: What does that mean?

Middle-aged woman: It means that if anything happens to our
borders on that side, she’s the first one in line for attack for
there.

This person not only makes no sense, but she can’t speak in an under-
standable way. Is that genetic? I doubt it. Intelligence, as it is popularly
defined, includes the ability to produce coherent speech, which cer-
tainly can be enhanced through teaching, but apparently not by our
schools as they currently exist.

Here is one last interview from that event:

Interviewer: What do you think of foreign policy—what would
you like to see her do with foreign policy?

don’t know her well enough. I don’t know what she knows or
doesn’t know. I don’t know some stuff of what people ask me.

Lawyers for U.S.-based
Turkish cleric fear attacks
on his life

WASHINGTON | BY JULIA HARTE

Lawyers for U.S.-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen said on Friday
they feared attacks on his life following Turkey's demands that he be
extradited to face allegations that he ordered a failed coup against the
government last month.

The lawyers said they expected Gulen, who has denied any
involvement in the July 15 coup attempt, will remain in his remote
mountain compound in Pennsylvania.

Fed up with the prosecutor and in the presence of the jury, the witness preceded to recount my debate
over recording from the first interview. Pointing to me in the back of the courtroom, the witness |
announced that I had warned him that they would pull this crap with the 302 report.

It didn't take the jury very long to acquit.

With the advent of DNA and groups like the Innocence Project, we have now seen that so-called
untecordéd confessions have put many innocent people in jail and even on Death Row. As a result,
agencies such as the BSO, now require all interviews to be taped.

Like anyone, including lawyers, the FBI wants to control the record of the interview. Taping hurts that
effort. .

I'm not saying that it is FBI policy to step over the line. But they have chalk on their shoes more often
_ than you can imagine.

So, what's should you do if the FBI comes calling?

First of all, the advice I am about to give is not for the a guy who was an inadvertent witness to a bank
robbery.

Tam talking about people who are being interviewed as part of the types of crimes that are best
described as corruption, RICO, white collar, etc.

Those are the kinds of cases that involve tons of evidence. Giving an innocent, but incorrect answer to a
vague question could leave any of us in deep CaCa.

‘A case in point is the lead story in the September 26, 2009 Herald. Chris Walton, director of the
Broward County Transportation Department, was interviewed by two FBI agents.

' He stated that they wanted to know if commissioners attempted-to influence contracts.
T told them no.

It may sound like a simple straight forward Q-and-A but it ain't necessarily so, He may think his
interview and public statement ends the matter:

In actuality, he has thrown down the gauntlet in front of the FBI.

Start out with the understanding that the FBI is not investigating to see if there is crime and ‘corruption in
Broward County government. They already believe there is. They are only trying to uncover evidence to
confirm their beliefs. -

rates/higher USD trades will soon resume. We make our case in the following sections.

Trade wars: near-term risk drops

Developments over the past three weeks have led us to conclude that the risk of trade
wars with Mexico and China has abated significantly, at least for the short-term:

¢ China: We take some comfort in the fact that the only item in his 100 day plan that
President Trump has reneged on is his promise to label China as a currency
manipulator on his first day as president (Table 1). In his interview with the WS) on
January 13, Trump said that he “would talk to them first”. He added: “Certainly they
are manipulators. But I’m not looking to do that.” This and the fact that Trump
changed tack on Taiwan last week by telling the Chinese president he would honor
the “One China” policy suggest to us a pragmatic approach to dealing with China.

¢ Mexico: We are relieved by the climbing-down by the administration after the
Mexican president cancelled his trip to Washington over Trump’s insistence that
Mexico pay for the wall. Reince Priebus, the influential White House Chief of Staff,
suggested that there is a “buffet of options” to pay for the wall, including by going
after the drug cartels. The Mexican foreign minister welcomed the overture by
saying that “It's a signal that ... must be welcomed because we are already seeing
how the discussion is changing”.

Table 1: Trump’s 100 day plan (On the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue the following):

A hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce the federal workforce through attrition Done
A requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated. Done
A five-year ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service. Done
A lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government. Done
I will announce my intention to renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205 Done
| will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Done
Lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward. Done
Begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia from one of the 20 judges on my list Done
Cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities. Done
Suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered “extreme vetting.” Done
Begin removing the more than two million criminal illegal immigrants from the country and cancel visas to foreign countries that won't take them back Done
| will direct the Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator. Not Done

| will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under

American and international law to end those abuses immediately. Not Done
Propose a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress. Not Done

ACA reforms: not before fiscal reforms

In an interview on February 5, Trump walked back his promise to replace Obamacare in
short order, saying that the process is “complicated” and “maybe it’ll take till sometime
into next year.” In contrast, asked if Americans should expect a tax cut this year, he said:
“| think before the end of the year | would like to say yes.”

In our view, the prevailing pessimism that Obamacare will take precedence over tax cuts
is not consistent with three key facts on the table:

* The Republicans, with only 52 seats in the Senate, do not have the votes to replace
Obamacare.

¢ It is by now a broadly shared view among Republican leadership that to repeal
Obamacare without replacing it would be very risky politically.

e There is no consensus among Republicans about how to replace Obamacare. For
example, 31 states took up federal funding to expand Medicaid under Obamacare

Cadogan Tate Sponsors 'New Sensations’ Art Exhibition

Sunday October 17, 2010 - 06:04 AM EDT

Cadogan Tate, the world class art moving, storage and shipping specialist in contemporary art
(http://www.cadogantate.com/fineart/contemporary-art-services.html), has sponsored the 'New Sensations
2010' exhibition for UK art students. Organised by Channel 4 and The Saatchi Gallery, this prestigious event aims
to discover the most imaginative and talented artists graduating from BA and MA courses in the UK and to
support students leaving art college.

A total of 20 students were shortlisted to present their work in the exhibition. This is being held at Boswall House,
2 Cornwall Terrace - a magnificent 18th century building off Regent's Park - from 14th to 20th October. The event
forms part of 'The House of the Nobleman'’, under the curatorship of Wolfe von Lenkiewicz and Victoria
Golembiovskaya.

Four of the finalists in New Sensations 2010 - Pablo Wendel, Katie Surridge, Nika Neelova and Ula Wiznerowicz -
have each been given a bursary to develop a new work for the exhibition. A short film about each of them was
aired on Channel 4 in early October.

Stephen Glynn, Cadogan Tate's Fine Art (http://www.cadogantate.com/fineart/) Director, comments: We are
delighted to be the sponsors of this important exhibition, which showcases the talent of some remarkable young
artists. We have spent many years transporting and storing the world's most precious contemporary art for
leading museums, galleries and collectors. It therefore seemed very appropriate that we should support and
encourage the UK's leading art students through this exciting event.

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021368.txt,"of dependence upon God for what one is,
However, long one exists.” A human
being therefore depends upon God for
more than the fact of his or her birth: he
or she remains dependent upon God in
the same way ever after. God’s creation
of the world in general is simply not
temporally indexed; it is no more closely
associated with the beginning of things
than with what comes later. A
preoccupation with temporal origins
therefore commonly drops out of
Christian accounts of creation: the world
is just as dependent upon God for its
existence whether it has a beginning or
always exists.” Belief in God’s creation
of the world for these reasons blurs into
belief in God’s supportive maintenance
of it at every point in time.

Also enabling belief in God as
creator to form a general backdrop to all
one’s experience—to be relevant on
every occasion as a universally
applicable worldview--is the fact that
God is thought to be responsible as
creator for the whole of what happens in
the world at any one time. To believe
that God is the creator of the world is at
the very least to believe that God holds
into existence the entirety of the world in
any and all respects in which it is good.
In the case of one’s own life, therefore,
every aspect of value at every moment—
one’s existence, fine qualities and
capacities, enjoyments and
achievements, beneficial connections
with natural and social environments,
and so on—is to be attributed to God’s
agency as creator. While there is a good
deal of disagreement within Christianity
on this matter, Christians, moreover, not
uncommonly affirm that God is equally
behind the bad things that happen, at
least insofar as those bad things can be
turned to good account--for example,
harm suffered turned into a salutary

122

Page

pedagogical correction, just punishment
for sin, the necessary testing of one’s
faith, or simply a beneficial form of
sympathy with God’s own suffering on
the cross. For both the general reasons
just mentioned—because of its holism
and temporal inclusiveness--belief in
God as the creator of the world
encourages love, gratitude, and trust
toward God, and toward the world that
God brings about, as constant Christian
dispositions, basic Christian attitudes of
wide-ranging applicability, whatever
might be going on in one’s life.

Social Connectedness and Invisibility

The same all-inclusive causal
dependence upon God at all times is
what ensures individuals are never left
on their own, never abandoned to their
own devices. Christian theologians
(especially in the Protestant tradition)
usually develop the psychological
implications of this in terms of avoiding
either anxious or arrogant self-
concern.” According to this theology,
one does not believe he or she ever
operates independently of God.
Therefore, one should never attribute
successes and achievements in a prideful
way to oneself, but rather one should
always give the glory to God as their
ultimate source. For the same reason,
one should never despair of failings, as if
one’s own inadequacies were the last
word; one believes a supremely
powerful and loving influence, God,
remains an operative force in one’s life,
However, desperate the situation
otherwise appears to be from the
standpoint of one’s own powers and
capacities to improve one’s lot in life.

By discouraging isolated self-
regard or self-understanding generally,
the same nexus of Christian ideas about
God as creator has clear consequences

complicated logic is at work. An “a leads to b and c” sort of logic: revolution leads to
freedom which leads to democracy, for instance. That such predictions are often
wrong - and that we’re so often surprised by events in economics or politics - is a
reminder that compicated systems are often complex, lit with mechanisms that
almost gleefully snap off the fingers of meddling, confident planners. Too often we
look at some puzzle - Iraq, income inequality - and think itis merely “complicated.”
We should know better. “Macro models failed to predict the crisis and seemed
incapable of explaining what was happening to the economy in a convincing
manner,” the European Central Banker Jean-Claude Trichet lamented in the
aftermath of 2008s cascading, complex financial crises, when markets and officials
discovered that the problem with their system was not merely that it was “too big to
fail” but also “too connected to manage” - and possibly “too complex to
comprehend.” Trichet sounded a little shell-shocked. “As a policy maker during the
crisis I found the available models of little help. In fact, I would go further: In the
face of the crisis, we felt abandoned by the conventional tools.”14

This sense of abandonment comes from an attempt to use a mechanical way of
thinking in age of complexity. 145 When you think an air force can simply pound an
insurgency to sand or that some old reliable business should survive because it rests
upon billions of dollars of infrastructure, you miss the energetic creative and
destructive power of complex connection. It’s not fully right to say: Networks
always beat hierarchies, because of course networks have layers and structures of
their own. But it’s not wrong to consider that complex systems tear easily at stiff,
competitive and overly-ordered ones, even the most carefully engineered
complicated ones. Think of the mafnicently ornamented dictatorships pushed to
collapse in recent years. Or, can you really look at the firm where you work and feel
a sense of living, flexible adaption in the face of connection?

In our age, the pressure of emerging change is particularly heightened by the very
nature of the digital devices themselves. The connected and algorithmic tools all
around us now lend themselves to the easy and cooperative interaction. In fact, that

IMAGES-008-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025264.txt,"Swiss equities

Preference: neutral

SMI (24 Oct): 6,627 (last publication: 6,540)
UBS View SMI (6-month target): 6,700

e We stay neutral on Swiss equities relative to global ones. Swiss companies are internationally well
diversified, with about 2/3 of revenues generated in the US and in emerging markets. This provides the
basis for solid revenue and earnings, despite economic weakness in Europe.

¢ Swiss companies are trying to mitigate concerns about global economic prospects and a strong Swiss
franc using tight cost controls. This should protect operating margins.

¢ While the Swiss franc remains overvalued, the currency is not longer a drag. In fact, after depreciating
since summer versus the USD and related currencies, Swiss companies’ earnings will show positive currency
translation and margin effects.

e Especially in an environment of low economic growth we like the properties of decent earnings growth,
solid balance sheets and a reasonable valuation.

4 Positive scenario SMI (6-month target): 7,500

e Eurozone economic growth is reaccelerating considerably, providing further relief to Swiss financials as
well as Swiss exporters. Defensive sectors would likely be left behind in a strong global relief rally. In this
scenario, we would expect the equity market P/E to be re-rated to 15x and earnings to grow by 5% over
the next six months.

& Negative scenario SMI (6-month target): 5,600

¢ The global economy slides into a recession. Despite being less dependent on the global business cycle,
Swiss companies will also feel the drop in global demand. In this scenario, corporate earnings are likely to
drop slightly over the next six months and we would expect the P/E to contract toward 12.0x.

Note: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)

Recommendations

Tactical (6 months)

e We favor large caps over small caps.

e We like stocks paying high and
sustainable dividends.

e Within defensives, we favor the
Healthcare and Consumer Staples
sectors.

e Among the cyclical companies, we
prefer those with a broad emerging-
markets exposure and/or cheap
valuation, including insurers.

Strategic (1 to 2 years)

e We favor leaders in regards to the two
key Swiss success factors: innovation and
globalization.

should be done immediately. 2. Should not be allowed to grant to foreign Gov't w 
Charitable dollars. That's basically lobbying or a bribe - charitable money shouldn't 
be allowed. Relates also to #1 above. 3. If charities want to spend charity dollars 
outside us should be required To go through USAid so it isn't being sneaky and on other 
agendas. 4. USAID should have a big charity division that does only this for Science

‘I’m not sure I’d like me if I was listening to me.’ – John Humphrys

John Humphrys is the Radio 4 Today programme presenter, whose forensic and sometimes aggressive interviews with figures in authority inspire love and loathing in equal measure. The Observer’s television critic once wrote that if he ever found himself sitting next to Humphrys at a dinner party he would probably drive a fork through his hand. The Tory politician Jonathan Aitken accused him of ‘poisoning the well of democratic debate’, a comment which prompted an outburst of support for Humphrys, with the Daily Mail describing him as ‘one of the most brilliant journalists in the country’.

This autumn, as Humphrys steps down after 32 years at Today and publishes a long-awaited memoir, he comes to the Intelligence Squared stage to give an exclusive, behind-the-scenes account of his extraordinary career.

Turning the tables on Humphrys and pitching the questions will be his Today colleague Justin Webb. Humphrys will recount the momentous episodes of his career, such as his interview with BBC correspondent Andrew Gilligan in 2003. Gilligan claimed that the government had deliberately ‘sexed up’ the dossier on the threat posed by Saddam Hussein in order to justify the Iraq War. A chain of events ensued, including the suicide of the dossier’s source, Dr David Kelly, severe damage to Tony Blair’s reputation and the Hutton and Chilcot inquiries into the war. And then there was the time Humphrys helped to get his own boss fired. His tough interview with the BBC Director General George Entwistle, days after the BBC had made false child abuse allegations against Lord McAlpine, lead to Entwistle’s resignation after a mere 53 days in the job.

Join us on October 9 <https://intelligencesquared.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9b096c9e607fbd256b4fab080&id=25897124f4&e=796428630f>  and hear Humphrys’ previously untold stories about politicians, celebrities and the BBC, and give his trenchant views on the role of the media in politics and the health of our political system.

Last month we were joined onstage by the University of Columbia economics professor Jeffrey Sachs, as he laid out his radical new vision for U.S. foreign policy. Instead of a world where America reigns as the sole superpower, Sachs argued for a new international system of equals, where America shares power and collaborates with former geopolitical rivals to solve today’s global crises.

Sachs was in conversation with the BBC’s Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet.

Privatization comes back to the government’s agenda

The consideration of a privatization program is not surprising at the current juncture, in
our view. Recall that the Saudi privatization program was initially started in 1999 with
the creation of the now-dissolved Supreme Economic Council, following the drop in oil
prices in 1998. Small-scale privatizations took place in the early 2000s, and 2002 saw
large privatization in the telecommunication sector and postal services.

Selling public sector stakes is one of the non-debt creating financing options for the
government that would help minimize the direct drain on Fx reserves, encourage private
sector development and improve services delivery. That being said, given the lack of
non-oil taxation, this would only contribute to one-off financing flows alongside savings
from a drop in budgetary allocations to the privatized entities, in our view.

The 2015 budgetary appropriations for public institutions totalled SAR163.7bn
(USS43.7bn; 19.0% of total budgeted spending and 6.8% of GDP). We calculate that the
public institutions related to the entities that appear to have been slated for
privatization according to press reports account for budgetary appropriations of
SAR124.8bn (US$33.3bn; 5.2% of GDP. This is likely to be the upper bound of fiscal
savings possible under the privatization program. In our view, this is unlikely to be
realized fully as it includes a large number of universities and because most timelines

appear to center around 2020.

of Edwards were scattered willy-nilly throughout the complaint. None of the allegations
provided any substance as to how Edwards actually assisted the Ponzi scheme, and allegations

that he “knew or should have known” of its existence are based upon an impermissible

pyramiding of inferences. In any event, these allegations all fail for one straightforward reason:

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029165.txt,"﻿	The Special Counsel's office, nearly leak-proof since its inception more than a year ago and seemingly immune to the President's constant taunts, might appear to be operating in some parallel universe unmoved by the every-day political turmoil. But in the course of conversations I've had recently, as a I research a new book on President Trump and the forces arrayed against him, what has become clear is that Robert Mueller and his office are preparing for a life or death confrontation with the President and the mother of all constitutional crises.
	My discussions have been with both White House advisors and people close to the investigation. No source involved in this story would speak on the record. But one source allowed me to review some of the documents related to the Special Counsel's strategy. Aspects of the Special Counsel's strategy have been confirmed by both White House sources and lawyers closely involved with the Justice Department. 
	Since at least April the Special Counsel has had in place proposed charges, a bill of particulars, and an aggressive legal theory for the indictment of the president for obstruction of Justice. In the last few weeks, as the President has indulged his pardon authority, the Mueller team has also developed a legal strategy to oppose what the Special Counsel believes will be a likely pardon of former National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, who had previously struck a plea bargain which could include his testimony against the President.
	Robert Mueller, according to one person familiar with the Special Counsel's thinking, could hardly contain his disgust when Rudy Giuliani, the President's new lawyer—hired to makes a television case for the President and to push back against the Mueller team—in May airily dismissed the notion that a president can be indicted. Adding insult to injury, Giuliani—who a White House source said had likely learned of aspects of the pending indictment—said Mueller agreed with that assessment. White House sources believe Giuliani was daring the Special Counsel to tip his hand. Mueller, in character, contained his outrage and continued to hold his cards close as his team finished preparing the obstruction case and refined the legal theories under which it would claim the right to haul the president into court.
	At this point, the case for indictment has, in effect, a judge of one. The Mueller team, according to sources both near the investigation and the White House, has prepared the case, but it requires the approval of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who—with the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions from the Russia-related investigation—oversees the Mueller team. Indeed, Rosenstein, as recently as April, publicly declared that the President was not a target. This may have been a form of fig leaf to soothe a President who regularly demands aides assure him he is not being pursued: the President does not become a formal target until Rosenstein agrees to designate him as one.
	The proposed indictment confronts Rosenstein with matters with which he has been intimately involved. The case, according to my conversations with White House and other sources familiar with the investigation, is fundamentally Trump versus the FBI, Justice Department, and Mueller investigation itself. In many ways, it boils down to the word of former FBI Director James Comey against the word of Donald Trump. Rosenstein, at the President's behest, drafted a memo justifying the Comey firing for how the former FBI Director handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation. But that justification, in an embarrassment for Rosenstein, was shortly brushed aside by the President when he admitted that he fired Comey to disrupt the Russian investigation. What's more, the indictment is said to charge that the firing of Andrew McCabe, the former Deputy Director of the FBI, who reported directly to Rosenstein after the Comey dismissal, was an instance of illegal retaliation by the President against a potential witness.
	According to a source with knowledge of the proposed indictment, it will be all the more controversial because if finds the entire narrative of the case for obstruction in plain sight. Almost nothing about the case involves new information. This indictment could have been drafted without anyone being interviewed, said this source. Rather it takes well covered public events and moves them to a set of circumstantial conclusions. There is no smoking gun beyond the often flagrant, custom-breaking, events of the President's 16 months in office. Indeed, much of the evidence is based on the President's public statements and tweets about those events.
	This is, according to White House sources who have gotten wind of this approach, good news: the case then, is just an issue of what motives you ascribe to the President's behavior—behavior that is, the President's supporters believe it is easy to show, impulsive and not thought out. Hence no intent. For the Mueller team, it is precisely that careless behavior and flagrant disregard for the rules that they aim to put on trial.
	There is no certainty that the Special Counsel's office will ultimately pursue its plan to indict the President. But, according to a source involved in the legal strategy, the plan is more advanced than it was when the indictment was drafted in April. The investigation continues and new evidence or other factors might push both prosecutors and the grand jury in another direction. Just passing its first anniversary, the Mueller investigation has conducted itself with remarkable secrecy. Descriptions of the proposed indictment provide one of the few insights into its strategy and its sense of the political peril in front of it.
	It may be noteworthy that there appears now not to be plan for an indictment related to collusion, although, legal experts say, that could come later.
	The White House view is that without the underlying collusion charge, Mueller will be presenting a weak and politically-motivated case. The Mueller view seems to be that the obstruction charges go to the heart of exposing how Trump has abused his power and turned the White House into a corrupt fiefdom.

	The President's scheme to obstruct the FBI's investigation into connections between the Trump campaign and Russian efforts to undermine the U.S. election, according to the Mueller indictment, began on the 7th day of the Trump administration. Three days prior to this, on January 24, National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, lied to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian Ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. These were contacts, directed by an unnamed but ranking member of the Presidential Transition team. 
	That unnamed person, in the view of several lawyers who discussed the case with me, is very likely Trump himself, and might imply that Trump encouraged Flynn to lie to the FBI, promising to protect him—using his influence or pardon powers.
	On January 27th, seven days after Donald Trump's inauguration, the President had the one-on-one dinner with FBI Director James Comey—recounted in Comey's congressional testimony and in his recent book, A Higher Loyalty—at which the President asked Comey if he wanted to stay on as FBI Director. The President then requested a loyalty pledge in an effort, according to Comey's testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, to create some sort of patronage relationship—a characterization the indictment accepts.
	Flynn resigned on February 13. The next day, the President cleared a meeting of its other attendees and privately asked Comey to let this go, to let Flynn go. The indictment accepts Comey's understanding that the President was requesting that [the FBI] drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December. 
	On March 30, 2017, ten days after Comey told the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence that the FBI was investigating links between the President's campaign and the Russian government, the President asked Comey to lift the cloud of the Russian investigation, further telling Comey that the investigation was creating problems for him and expressing the hope that Comey would find a way to get it out that [the FBI] [wasn't] investigating him.
	On April 11, according to the indictment, the President asked the FBI Director what he had done about this request that [Comey] 'get out' that [the President] is not personally under investigation, saying that the cloud was getting in the way of his ability to do his job. Comey asked the President to send his request to the appropriate parties at the Department of Justice. The President agreed but reminded Comey that he had been very loyal to you [Comey], very loyal; we had that thing, you know.
	On May 9, the President fired Comey, publicly saying  that the Russian thing played a role in his decision to fire the FBI Director. The next day, the President said he'd faced great pressure because of Russia, and as a result of the firing, that pressure had been taken off.
	On May 17, soon after learning about the appointment of the Special Counsel by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein—in his role as acting Attorney General, after the recusal of Attorney General Jefferson Sessions—the President accused Sessions of disloyalty for recusing himself from the Russian investigation. In June 2017, the indictment alleges, the President ordered Robert Mueller to be fired, reversing course only when the White House counsel, Don McGahn, refused to implement the order. 
	On July 8, after reports of a meeting between the President's son, Donald Trump, Jr., and a Russian agent, Natalia Veselnitskaya, during the 2016 campaign, the President, in furtherance of a cover-up, the indictment alleges, directed his son to state that he and Veselnitskaya had primarily discussed a program about the adoption of children, when, in fact, according to the indictment, the meeting was organized so that Russia and its government could provide the Presidential campaign with official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary Clinton, the presumed Democratic candidate for President.
	According to the indictment, by June 7, 2017, news outlets were reporting that the Deputy Director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, could corroborate James Comey's allegation that the President had asked for Comey's loyalty before firing him. As part of the cover-up, the indictment alleges, on July 26, 2017, the President called upon the Attorney General to fire McCabe.
	On December 21, 2017, McCabe testified before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence that the President had in fact asked Comey for his loyalty before firing him. Six days later, in retaliation, the President tweeted that McCabe was racing the clock to retire with full benefits, and implying by use of a question mark, that it was uncertain whether McCabe had 90 days to go?!!!
	On March 16, 2018, McCabe was dismissed, depriving him of his pension. According to the indictment, the President directed McCabe to be fired with the intent to threaten and retaliate against him, the FBI, and the Office of the Special Counsel, or to impede their respective abilities to assist or carry out the work of the FBI, DOJ, the Office of the Special Counsel, the Congressional Intelligence Committees, and the grand jury.
	Together with its narrative of Presidential behavior with, it contends, the certain intention of subverting ongoing investigations, the Mueller office is also ready to argue its right and obligation to charge a sitting president with a criminal violation. 
	It is the outline of this argument that White House sources say both prompted Rudy Giuliani to scoff at the idea of indictment and, several weeks later, for the President and his lawyer to make sweeping claims about Presidential authority. 
	It is a coming battle of absolutist positions.
	The Special Counsel, according to reports from both the investigation and from the White House, has spelled out an argument—one that appears to be at odds with Department of Justice standing policy that precludes charging a sitting president with a crime—that nothing in the Constitution or in an statute suggests a status with regard to criminal prosecution for the President different from any other federal office. Nor is there any statute or case law that finds that impeachment has to come before an indictment. The Mueller team dismisses the argument made most aggressively by Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz—who offers frequent legal advice to the President both in person and via television—and repeated recently by the President, and in the recently revealed letter sent by his lawyers to the Special Counsel in January, that a president cannot be prosecuted for exercising his constitutional prerogatives, even if they foster crimes. Again, the team argues that there is no statute or constitutional authority that puts the President above the law or that allows him to contribute to breaking the law.
	Curiously, the tradition breakers in the White House—supported by a many lawyers, both right and left leaning—now argue that the President's traditional and constitutionally mandated executive powers give him wide latitude for how he carries out his duties. I don't think you are going to find a court who will not see the president's role as unique, said one White House advisor. The Mueller theories are wishful thinking.
	Such an indictment is described in similar ways by both Mueller and White House insiders: it puts the President's public behavior on trial. The nature of that behavior, for the Mueller team, is corrupt; this, according to the White House, is how voters elected the President to behave.

	The Mueller team may have a high hurdle in convincing Rosenstein to approve the indictment. Giuliani recently put standing DOJ policy against the indictment of a president in hyperbolic terms: the President could kill James Comey if he wanted to without fear of prosecution. But, according to one former senior DOJ lawyer, Rosenstein in this circumstance may have the power to override the DOJ guidelines. The Mueller team appears to believe that Rosenstein's pledge before congress that, absent malfeasance, he will support the Special Counsel's independence with regard to the Russian investigation, means he will let the indictment go forward. In one view—and in the suspicion of some in the White House—he may have already authorized Mueller to proceed with the indictment.
	The counsel's office does, however, according to the papers I have reviewed, worry about the possibility that Trump will replace Rosenstein with someone who will fire Mueller or curtail the investigation. Indeed, the Mueller investigation seems concerned or shadowed by daily procedural questions of an existential nature—anticipating its own demise and what consequences that might bring. 
	It believes that in the inevitable Supreme Court battle that would follow a direct attempt by the President to fire the Special Counsel, the Court would surely rebuff such an expansion of Presidential authority. At the same time, according to its internal research, the Mueller team understands that the President, acting with only somewhat more subtlety, would have the authority to order the Attorney General—even given his prior recusal—to repeal the Special Counsel regulations and close down the investigation, and fire the Attorney General if he refuses. The President, could, too, according to the Special Counsel's analysis, fire Rosenstein and seek someone else to oversee the investigation in ways more to his liking. Both of these actions could, the Special Counsel believes, become part of the behavior that it argues in the indictment amounts to a prima facie case for obstruction of justice. 
	The team does yet believe it is protected by political realities—the President can not know how Congress might respond—and by bureaucratic ones. Changes to the Special Counsel authorization might require an extended comment period.
	Still, what if the President acting unilaterally does shut it down? This, people around the President say is the unknown legal area that might be advantageous to the President. Delays and disruption might well be the President's legal friends. 
	What, for instance, happens to all the work the Special Counsel's office had done, and, indeed, to the sitting Grand Juries reviewing the evidence? The special counsel's view, according to insiders working on the issues, is that nobody knows. The optimistic legal view is that the Office and staff would survive the Special Counsel's ouster and their work preserved. And that actions taken by the Grand Jury would remain in effect.
	This, however, would probably not be true if the Attorney General refused the next Special Counsel's budget request—due on July 1. That would shut down the whole operation—the Special Counsel staff and grand juries. There might, however, according to research the team has prepared, be enough time between the order and the shuttering for the Special Counsel to share the grand jury evidence with other federal prosecutors.
	The President's constitutional pardon powers appear to be some of the most troubling and threatening issues for the Special Counsel. The Counsel's office believes the President will use his pardon power as an instrument to undermine the investigation.
	According to present and former White House advisors, the President's recent spates of pardons are in part his way of taunting the Special Counsel. The White House, according to these sources, is aware that the Special Counsel has concluded the pardon power is near absolute: the President can certainly pardon himself, and others involved in the investigation. 
	Early in June, the Special Counsel, believing that a pardon for Michael Flynn was imminent, rushed to build a case that might form an exception to the President's pardon authority. The argument, perhaps a slim thread one, tries to undermine what both the White House and many outside legal authorities, and much of the Special Counsel's own research, believes to be one of the few unchallengeable powers granted the President. In effect, the Special Counsel continues the theme of it's case: there is a level of obstruction of justice that all reasonable men might know when they see it. If you pardon someone to get yourself off the hook, that's a corrupt action. Since the President is in charge of upholding the constitution and much of the constitution is about preventing corrupt acts, the pardon, in the case of Michael Flynn, is unconstitutional. What's more, since there is an impeachment process in place—or there at least several impeachment resolutions before congress—and impeachment is the province of Congress, a pardon of a potential witness in this impeachment is an unconstitutional trampling on the separation of powers.

	As the President, by nature and design, tries to claim aggressive new powers, the Mueller team, almost in equal proportion, is trying to limit the theory of Presidential power and, even, to criminalize an expansive exercise of those powers. 
	People who know and have worked with Mueller find it, at best, unexpected that such a traditional, and by the book, G-man, would be pursuing such far-reaching legal theories. One view, shared by the White House, is that Mueller is overly reliant on his staff. In this scenario, the legal charge is being led by his number two, Andrew Weissman, the aggressive prosecutor whose pursuit of the accounting firm Arthur Anderson in the Enron debacle end in its conviction—a judgement reversed well after the firm's bankrupcy and dissolution. Weissman is a particular bet noir and favorite whipping boy for the White House. 
	But in another view it is precisely because Mueller, a former Marine, is so by the book and Semper Fi that he finds Trump's behavior to be personally offensive, and, on its face, corrupt. Bob Mueller is all about limits and rules. Donald Trump has none and acknowledges none.
	It may yet be even a more profound clash then that, the executive branch at war with itself—the Justice Department against the White House.
	Indeed, it is a war strategy, in the view of some legal observers. Such an indictment would be litigated to the hilt. It would force both the substantive issues of obstruction and abuse of power and the meta issues of Presidential immunity—the hot button issues of the President's claims to being above the law—into open court for a long and painful review and dissection that might shadow the November election. 
	Legal experts believe that the Mueller team might well prevail in lower courts with a less likely, but not at all certain outcome, in the Supreme Court. 
	Might such an expansive claim win, yes. Should it win, no. But everyone knows the reality: weak president's lose cases, strong president's win them.
	Were the case to reach the Supreme Court after the November election, it might well be the results of that election that help seal the President's fate not just in Congress but also in the courts.

Walton's blanket defense of the Commission has made the Feds conclude he is a fool or co-conspirator.

The FBI just needs the evidence and not much of it. To quote the late Supreme Court Justice William.
Brennan: “any prosecutor worth his salt could indict a ham sandwich. ’ .

This means all evidence, regardless of its ambiguous nature, will be interpreted to support their
assumption of wrongdoing.

~ They will be using software to go through millions of E-mail messages to look for key words. As Buddy
has quoted me: The 'E' in E-mail stands for evidence.

Six months from now 7 iey uncover an ere from the County Manager to Walton stating that
‘Commissioner X wants to know if the bid of company Y for new busses was correctly filled out. He
replies that it was.

Months later he has totally forgotten about the innocuous E-mail. Based on the merits, he happens to
rank Y's bid number one.

You can bet as sure as J. Edgar Hoover wore pink poodle skirts, the FBI will conclude this was code
from Commissioner X to Walton to vote for Y.

- Armed with the E-mail you can be damnes sure that the G-Men will be back threatening him with
everything including a stint in Gitmo.

All of this might have been avoided if he had followed my three basic rules.

Interviewer: Some of the viewers think there’s not enough oil.

Man with cap: We got us self-sufficient energy gas oil right
under our feet. Why aren’t we exploring more for it and
drilling here instead of sending all that money overseas and
exporting, I mean importing, all that oil back to America?

Interviewer: Do you hope she runs for president in 2012?

Man with cap: Yes, I do.

Interviewer: You will support her?

Man with cap: I sure would.

Interviewer: Do you think there will be any problems supporting
her, knowing that you’re unfamiliar with her foreign policy
issues?

Man with cap: That wouldn’t keep me from not voting for her.

There is a difference between ignorance and stupidity, just as there is a
difference between knowledge and intelligence. It is a good guess that
the “man with cap” above is both stupid and ignorant. The question
is why?

One reason is that it is now acceptable in our society to be ignorant
and stupid. Here is some of the famous ABC/Charles Gibson interview
with Sarah Palin during the 2008 presidential campaign:

Gibson: Do you agree with the Bush doctrine?

Palin: In what respect, Charlie?

Gibson: The Bush—well, what do you—what do you interpret it
to be?

Palin: His worldview.

Gibson: No, the Bush doctrine, enunciated September 2002,
before the Iraq war.

Palin: I believe that what President Bush has attempted to do
is rid this world of Islamic extremism, terrorists who are
hellbent on destroying our nation. There have been blunders
along the way, though. There have been mistakes made.

And with new leadership, and that’s the beauty of American
elections, of course, and democracy, is with new leadership
comes opportunity to do things better.

Gibson: The Bush doctrine, as I understand it, is that we have the
right of anticipatory self-defense, that we have the right to a
preemptive strike against any other country that we think is
going to attack us. Do you agree with that?

In addition, the judge before whom the accusation was made struck the accusation from the
record and sanctioned her lawyers for filing it. One of her own lawyers then acknowledged that

9 66

his client was “wrong” “simply wrong,” and her other lawyers formally withdrew the accusation,

admitting it was a “mistake.”

Not only did Virginia Roberts lie about me, she lied about Al and Tipper Gore and President Bill
Clinton claiming that she met the three of them on Jeffrey Epstein’s island — a claim refuted by
secret service records that established that none of the three were on that island during that
period of time.

There is evidence that directly proves I was framed. These include emails between Roberts and a
journalist, a book manuscript by Roberts and a legal brief that are smoking guns showing that I
was “deliberately framed for financial reasons.” These exculpatory documents have been sealed
by Roberts’ lawyers and I am seeking to make them public.

Roberts’ closest friend told me that Roberts told her she “felt pressure to go after [Dershowitz]”
in order to obtain money from Leslie Wexner and that Roberts had never previously included
me among the people with whom she claimed to have had sex. I have a tape recording of this
conversation.

Not surprisingly, Roberts made her false claims against me only in court documents that
immunize her from being sued for defamation. When she was interviewed by the Miami Herald,
she refused to repeat her false allegations outside of court. The Crimson did not ask her directly
to repeat her false allegations to them. As a matter of journalistic ethics, The Crimson should
not have published an accusation without interviewing the accuser on the record. I now
challenge Roberts to repeat her false accusations to The Crimson or other media, so that I can
sue her for defamation and let a jury decide — after seeing all the evidence including the emails
and book manuscript — who is telling the truth and who is lying.

I want an investigation or trial to finally prove that Roberts made up the entire story, so that it
can finally be put to rest.

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031485.txt,"We have read concerns from Turkey that Mr. Gulen, this elderly, frail
religious leader, is going to flee to another country, said Steptoe &
Johnson LLP attorney Reid Weingarten on Friday, calling such
allegations absurd.

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has blamed Gulen for the violence,
in which Erdogan said 237 people were killed excluding the plotters
and more than 2,100 wounded, and said the United States should
extradite him to Turkey. The U.S. government has not done so, and
the dispute has raised questions about relations between the two allies.

Turkey, a member of the NATO alliance, hosts American troops and
warplanes at Incirlik Air Base, an important staging area for the U.S.-
led fight against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

At a news conference in Washington, Weingarten and Michael Miller,
another Steptoe attorney, said evidence from a 2015 case financed by
the Turkish government against Gulen in U.S. federal court in
Pennsylvania showed that the Turkish government relies on dubious
proof to make its case against him.

That case alleged Gulen issued coded orders to followers in the
Turkish judiciary in a 2009 sermon to persecute members of another
religious sect. It also alleged that the script of a popular Turkish
television show was laced with follow-up messages. The case was
dismissed by a judge in June.

Turkish government officials, however, say such evidence is valid
because Gulen operates covertly and sends encoded messages to his
followers.

Turkey has sent the United States new documents in recent days
containing evidence that Turkish authorities say proves the cleric was

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027985.txt,"from the SEALs in getting ashore, only one required direct co-ordination with
us. This was an attack on a DFLP building a mile or so away in southern Beirut,
led by Amnon Lipkin, the friend whose unit had faced one of the toughest
battles at Karameh. Amnon’s paratroop force would land with us and also pile
into Mossad rental cars. Our attacks would begin at the same time, with the
maximum prospect of retaining the advantage of surprise. When and if we both
completed the operations and got away safely, we would meet up again on the
seafront.

From our first meeting, the morning after Dado gave me the go-ahead, I
realized I would have to make at least one change to the plan to rely on the core
Sabena team. There was no way, after his exclusion from the hijack rescue
mission, that I could refuse Yoni when he pressed to be included. I added him to
Mookie Betzer’s force. I put the other two attack teams under a pair of young
officers named Amitai Nachmani and Zvika Gilad. Both were self-confident,
natural leaders. Both had other qualities I also knew we’d need: focus, and
calm. I would take charge on the street outside the targeted apartments, along
with Amiram Levin. With us would be Dov Bar, a Shayetet 13 officer, and our
medic, Shmuel Katz.

In the hangar at the sayeret base, we made mock-ups of the layout of the
apartments, using bedsheets for the walls and adjusting the dimensions as
further bits of intelligence came in from Mossad. But the real work involved
simulating the whole operation, from the moment of our landing on jet-black
rubber dinghies piloted by the SEALs. We found a new building development
in north Tel Aviv with a pair of apartment blocks under construction. For two
nights, we ran through the whole thing: setting off in the dinghies from a missile
boat off the Israeli coast before midnight, meeting up with our Mossad drivers
on shore, making our way through the center of Tel Aviv to the apartment
complexes and simulating the attack. I wanted to ensure we could pull off the
whole thing without anyone raising an alarm. The one problem came during the
second run-through. A policeman drove by as we were “attacking” the
apartments. Dado managed to convince him that reporting us to his superiors
would not be an especially good idea.

In our debriefing discussions after that exercise, Dado identified a major
problem I’d overlooked. We would be entering Beirut dressed as civilians. Once
we got to the top end of Rue Verdun, we planned to approach the apartments as
if we were party-goers returning from a night on the town. “It doesn’t look
right,” Dado said. “More than a dozen party people walking, all men?” Mookie

countries come successively.

* Does this will include the development of ports?

- That is true. developing seaports or participate in the industrial cities on the Red Sea. Another
opportunity we're working on is a Saudi and Gulf states exports to Europe, 40% of Saudi Arabia and the
Gulf states exports to Europe. Especially, the Gulf countries pass from the Arabian Gulf to the Strait of
Hormuz to the Arabian Sea to Bab El Mandeb to the Red Sea to the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean Sea
and this period takes the cost and security risk, while we can provide them passage through Saudi Arabia
directly to the bridge of the King Salman, who announced it last year to North Sinai, which reduces the
time and cost. Where security guarantees are much higher than those in which they pass.

* Are you involved in the King Salman Bridge project?

- Without a doubt, this will create a lot of industries and businesses inside Saudi Arabia from connecting
roads, connecting power grids, linking gas and oil pipelines, and connecting railways to North Sinai. The
third opportunity we aim at in Logistics is aviation, today our brothers in the United Arab Emirates and in
Qatar have done a very good job of flying in the Middle East, while they do not have a strong domestic
market to rely on to take over and control the Middle East markets. Saudi Arabia has the largest
domestic market as an airline market. Saudi Airlines companies should have a much larger stake in the
Middle East Airlines today, this is also the third aspect we seek.

* What are the reasons for the absence of the Saudi aviation, is the weakness of the airports is the
reason?

- The absence of strategy, there is no strategy and no vision. The tendency was a random move until we
reached the stage we reached today, while if you set a goal and plans to reach this goal there will be an
achievement of these results up to 100% or 50% or 30%. Briefly, the fund will be the main driver of the
major sectors within Saudi Arabia. The fund will have a very large cash flow from Aramco and this will be
directed in no less than 50% and up to 70% in new sectors within Saudi Arabia (mining, local content,
logistics). After covering opportunities within Saudi Arabia, the remaining 50% and 30% will be directed
to outside Saudi Arabia to the promising sectors that are possible to be in the forefront ten years from
today, and. Details for all of this will be announced in the launch of the program of the Public Investment
Fund in accurate and detailed manner.

* When the project was announced cash; people reacted that they wanted the habitation, what the
opinion of Your Highness?

- We have so many fronts we are working on them, and we cannot then stop a certain entity that
achieved an achievement because there is a delay in the other side. It will disrupt the work of the whole
government, it is imposed on all sides to support, stimulate and reach an achievement, and the one that
is delayed is to be investigated about the delay and its reasons and how we work on it. This is a side, the
other side that spend on the public investment fund is not the state. It is one of the fund's unexploited
assets. In the past, it was giving us a profit of 1%, and at the best case 2.5%, and there are bonds and
funds outside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Today, we transfer these amounts to Saudi Arabia and we
invest in sectors that give a profit of better than 2.5% or 1%, develop key sectors and contribute to the
local content on the entertainment side. Ultimately, this will create profits for the Fund, the Fund will

former girlfriend and long-time friend of Epstein’s, was involved in managing Epstein’s
affairs and companies I had her served for deposition for August 17, 2009. (Deposition
Notice attached to Statement of Undisputed Facts as Exhibit BB). Maxwell was
represented by Brett Jaffe of the New York firm of Cohen and Gresser, and I
understood that her attorney was paid for (directly or indirectly) by Epstein. She was
reluctant to give her deposition, and I tried to work with her attorney to take her
deposition on terms that would be acceptable to both sides. Her attormey and I
negotiated a confidentiality agreement, under which Maxwell agreed to drop any
objections to the deposition. Maxwell, however, still avoided the deposition. On June
29, 2010, one day before I was to fly to NY to take Maxwell’s deposition, her attorney
informed me that Maxwell’s mother was deathly ill and Maxwell was consequently
flying to England with no intention of returning and certainly would not return to the
United States before the conclusion of Jane Doe’s trial period (August 6, 2010).
Despite that assertion, I later learned that Ghislaine Maxwell was in fact in the country
on approximately July 31, 2010, as she attended the wedding of Chelsea Clinton
(former President Clinton’s daughter) and was captured in a photograph taken for US
Weekly magazine.

intended to take Donald Trump’s deposition in the civil suits against him. Trump was
properly noticed because: (a) after review of the message pads confiscated from
Epstein’s home, the legal and investigative team assisting my clients learned that Trump
called Epstein’s West Palm Beach mansion on several occasions during the time period
most relevant to my clients’ complaints; (b) Trump was quoted in a Vanity Fair article
about Epstein as saying I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He's a lot

that Trump banned Epstein from his Maralago Club in West Palm Beach because
Epstein sexually assaulted an underage girl at the club; (d) Jame Doe No. 102’s

Ghislaine Maxwell and recruited to be Maxwell and Epstein’s underage sex slave; (e)

Budgeted defence spending — up or down

Localization policies in the defence industry could help cut imports (total defence
imports of USS$9.8bn equivalent to US$1.5bn or 6% of total imports in 2015, according
to consultancy IHS) and conserve Fx reserves, but we expect this to be a slow and
gradual process. We think that large defense imports are typically amortized over a
number of years. Defence spending is an important part of fiscal spending in Saudi
Arabia, accounting for c30% of total budgeted spending. Defence spending in 2016 was
budgeted at SAR213bn (US$56.9bn; 9.0% of GDP), down from SAR307bn (US$81.8bn;
12.7% of GDP) in 2015. Increased military and security projects in 2015 saw an
additional overspend of SAR2Obn last year. It is unclear to us if all of the regional
military costs have been recognised on-balance sheet. A negotiated settlement to the
Yemen conflict through the ongoing political negotiations in Kuwait could help contain
security spending near-term.

data-enabled phone or camera or database or stock-trading program is easy and
powerful to use because so much of the world’s data - your Sigur Ros songs, your
home movies, your skin temprature — can be reduced to ones and zeros, freed for
fast transmission, endless storage and quick analysis.!1” A machine that can blithely
handle digital inputs of one sort, whether it is trading orders or music files, has the
capacity, in theory, to work with any data. Such adjustability is what forces app
companies, gaming businesses, or phone companies onto an exhausting treadmill of
constant upgrade. Interaction between the pieces of a system, every bit as much as
design or mechanical manipulation, is the reason why change happens.!!8
Entrepreneurs mix GPS and phones to create a new business of tracking everything
from our cars to our children. Algorithmic trading programs engineer completely
virtual portfolios - you can buy the S&P Index but as your manager to strip out any
performance from tobacco and gun companies, for instance. Or: Terrorists meet
online and swap data. Some of the most astonishing systems of our new world have
grown up this way. Google’s back-end search systems, for instance, were not “top-
down” designed so much as they emerged, competed and evolved to deliver once-
unimaginable loads of data. No one at Google is “The Architect.” There is no central
approval for technology systems. Complexity and unpredictability and emergence
are regarded as the best way to grow. 119

Long before the idea of a smart phone or 3D goggles, the British mathematician
Alan Turing anticipated their arrival when he dreamed of what he called a
“universal device”!2°: A notional box that, starting from the ones and zeros of
digitized data, could be constructed to do anything. Since everything can ultimately
be reduced to a binary encoding, nearly any sort of data can be shared, studied,
combined or remixed. This easy programmability of so many objects around us now
is why our world now is more complex than, say, a world of interconnected rail cars
or ships might have been. Rail cars and ships don’t change much, and certainly not
instantly. In the digital world, however, many of the most essential objects and
nodes can be flipped around like digital Lego, connected in different ways. And
because they are increasingly “always on”, they are also always changing and
adjusting to what happens elsewhere on the network. This is true for some new
operating system dumped onto your phone that makes it more intelligent as it is for
an algorithm placed into a commodity market that causes unexpected chaos.

Preference: neutral

Topix (24 Oct): 743 (last publication: 743)

UBS view Topix (6-month target): 756

e We expect earnings growth of about 25% over the upcoming 12 months. A relatively high growth rate
still reflects last year's sharp decline caused by two natural disasters. Still, the earnings recovery has
disappointed so far. Earnings growth continues to slow down and is expected to move toward a more
normal single-digit growth in 2013.

¢ The government started implementing its JPY 18 trillion recovery budget in Q4 2011; we expect it to
boost GDP by 0.5-1.0% in FY2012, and about 0.5% in 2013.

e However, we see only limited scope for an additional earnings boost from the local economic recovery.
Slowing export markets also curtail the outlook. June quarter-earnings results revealed emerging market
demand was below expectation, capping earnings growth.

e We expect the TOPIX trailing P/E to drop to around 13.5x from 15.0x over the coming months, mainly due
to the earnings recovery; this provides room for moderate price increases only.

A Positive scenario Topix (6-month target): 970

¢ Stronger global demand and stabilizing European markets lead to improved risk-taking. Falling risk
aversion is likely to lead to a weaker yen, providing an additional increase in earnings. We expect 10-15%
EPS growth in FY2013 and the TOPIX target is based on 16.0x trailing P/E.

& Negative scenario Topix (6-month target): 575

¢ Faltering global growth leads to weak exports, triggering negative earnings surprises. USD-JPY rate
strengthening to below 75 and potential economic conflicts with China might serve as an additional drag

on earnings. We would then expect the P/E ratio to contract to 13.0x and earnings to fall during the
upcoming six months.

Note: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)

What we're watching Why it matters

JPY and exports The exchange rate is an important factor for the Japanese equity market. Japan’s

21, Japanese trade balance

BoJ’s monetary policy

If the Bank of Japan makes additional commitments to its asset-purchase
board meeting

program, which is currently JPY 70 trillion in size, it would lead to a weaker yen,

Recommendations

Tactical (6 months)

e Japanese value stocks have under-
performed growth stocks by more than
20% for the last four months. We see this
as an overreaction to concerns on the
slower global economy, and recommend
picking some value stocks with high
dividend yields.

We prefer companies that are using cost-
reduction initiatives to maintain price
competitiveness during periods of yen
strength.

Strategic (1 to 2 years)

e A weaker USD-JPY rate may drive
Japanese companies’ earnings recovery
beyond a technical recovery from natural
disasters. Japanese exporters and
companies owning international
operations would benefit from such a
development.

Japanese realized earnings likely to
recover further going forward

Foreword and Acknowledgements

The idea of compiling an Oxford companion to the Arab-Israeli conflict was first
presented to me in 2005 by Markus Bouillon, who served for me both in my UN
capacity in Jerusalem and at the International Peace Institute (IPI) in New York. Nur
Laiq laboriously and faithfully collected most of the relevant documents and contrib-
uted to the organization of the book and the drafting of the introduction and com-
ments. Fabrice Aidan, a French diplomat, who served for ten years as my special
assistant and political adviser in my different United Nations capacities played an
instrumental role for the production of this volume. He made essential substantive
inputs to the organization and compilation of the documents and the composition of
the comments, throughout the book, as well as to the introduction. David Makovsky
and Marwan Muasher deserve thanks for reviewing the book and for providing
insightful comments.

I would like also to thank my staff at the International Peace Institute (IPI), Walter
Kemp and Adam Lupel, for their editing contribution. Miklos Pinther, former chief
UN cartographer, who in 2000 oversaw the delineation of the Blue Line between Israel,
Lebanon and Syria, compiled and produced the maps in this volume. Finally, my
executive assistant, Jilla Moazami, gave invaluable administrative support. Without
these colleagues, the book would have never come to print. I am delighted that the
volume came to its conclusion on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the signing of
the Oslo Accords of 1993.

I am grateful to the Government of Norway for generous support to the Inter-
national Peace Institute’s (IPI) Middle East program over many years.

I dedicate the book to my beloved wife, Ambassador Mona Juul, my companion in
war and peace, without whom I would never have become involved in the imbroglio of
the Middle East.

IMAGES-006-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021369.txt,"for loneliness or perceived social
isolation. Because they believe
themselves to be creatures of God,
Christians feel related to God whatever
happens. Whatever their social
circumstances--no matter, at the
extreme, how isolated or strong their
feelings of abandonment by human
others--individuals are to remember that
they remain in a relationship with God,
who is concerned about them. Even
when they feel themselves utterly
forsaken by others, Christians have
reason to believe God cannot be
forsaking them. They can believe they
are never alone even when they appear
to be absolutely so. In such
circumstances, Christians can always
avail themselves of a completely
counterfactual sense of social connection
with the best-connected “superfriend” of
all—the God who remains, they believe,
in a relationship of ultimately beneficial
causal efficacy with not just themselves
but everyone and everything.

It is the very unapparent,
counterfactual character of God’s
influence on human lives—the
invisibility of God’s influence, in short--
that permits Christians to perceive their
relationship with God as an unbreakable
constant. Because God’s influence is
unapparent or invisible Christians can
continue to believe God is operative for
creation’s benefit in the absence of any
of the obvious confirming evidence
required in ordinary cases of beneficent
human influence. Christians who believe
that God is a universal influence for
good as the world’s creator do not
expect God to be present in the way one
expects a human person to be; and
therefore God’s apparent absence, in
human terms, need not break down their
sense of being in relation to God.

123

Page

Having God as one’s creator (in
the best case scenario) is like having a
perfectly loving human benefactor; but it
is the unusual invisibility of this
benefactor that allows Christians to think
God present even when not apparently
so. Being in a relationship with God for
Christians who believe God is a good
creator is something like being in a
relationship with a human person who
never lets one out of her sight and who
intends one’s good comprehensively. It
is, for example, very like being ina
relationship with a loving parent who is
fully responsible, not just for the fact of
one’s existence, but in a comprehensive
way for one’s nurturance throughout an
extended minority. Unlike a relationship
with an ordinary human person of that
sort, however, God is believed to be
invisible and this is what allows
individuals to assume God’s constant
presence, all appearances to the contrary.

The invisibility that underlies the
Christian affirmation of God’s constancy
here is a function of the very diffuseness
of God’s influence, a diffuseness of
influence no human person, invisible or
otherwise, could possibly match. Belief
in God as the creator of the world does
not encourage one to single out God as
the cause of any specific happening in a
way that suggests God is one cause
among many, the cause of this particular
happening rather than some other with a
different cause. Belief in God as the
creator of the world does not allow one
to identify God’s influence in overly
close fashion with any particular causal
influence of a beneficent sort. Instead, as
I have suggested, whatever is of benefit
to the individual, over the long or short
term, taken as a whole, is to be attributed
to God’s influence.

The Christian cannot, then, locate
or pick out God as one could a loving

The Art Market: a house party

Published: 21:54 - 06/10/10

The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience
caused.

Frieze week kicks off this week in London, drawing the cream of the art world to Britain's capital. It is centred of
course on the fair that started it all (Frieze opens to the public in Regent's Park on Thursday), but a host of
satellite events are also on offer. One of the more intriguing is taking place just down the road from the fair, at 2
Cornwall Terrace, part of an enormously expensive real estate project being developed and sold.

In what appears to be a sophisticated way of selling both art and the property, the 18th-century mansion is being
used as a temporary venue for an exhibition entitled The House of the Nobleman, October 15-20. The format is
hybrid, both commercial and non-commercial, with 68 works on show, half of them loans from collectors - one is
David Roberts, the rest are secret - the other half consisting of works of art for sale.

The House of the Nobleman is curated by the artist Wolfe von Lenkiewicz, who has teamed up with a young
Russian curator, Victoria Golembiovskaya. It is backed by Mirax, a Russian real estate company that has a
significant but minority stake in the Cromwell Terrace complex. Mirax belongs to a Russian billionaire, Sergei
Polonsky, but Mirax has been troubled since the financial recession and has a reported $120m in debt; the firm
did not respond to a request for comment. The eight houses in the Cromwell Terrace complex are priced between
£29m and £60m.

Various dealers, from the UK and elsewhere, are contributing works of art to the show; they range from two
paintings by Poussin to Picasso's Buste d'Homme a la Pipe (1969), priced at £3m. Banksy, Richter, Klein, Rodin,
Cézanne and Warhol are the unlikely bedfellows in the show, which includes two works by Von Lenkiewicz himself
(at £60,000 and £50,000). While entry is free, visitors must register for admission (www.cornwallterrace.co.uk);
they will be taken around in groups of 50, according to the curators.

Tax reform: BAT won’t kill it

The proposed border adjustment tax in the Ryan-Brady plan has been attracting a lot of
attention lately. Although we have concerns about some specific aspects of the proposal
(which we will discuss later), the popular view that it could be a deal breaker for the
whole tax reform initiative seems to us difficult to substantiate.

Below are some key facts that are worth noting:

« — It has been thirty years since the US last overhauled its tax code. Most mainstream
economists agree that it needs a serious update.

* Tax reform requires strong political consensus. The Republicans, by gaining control
of the Presidency and retaining their control of both houses of Congress in the
November elections, are in a strong position to push through major tax reform.

* The tax reform proposal from House Republicans has already gone through
extensive consultations and enjoys broad support within the House Republican
Conference.

e One of the key commitments of the Trump campaign is tax cuts and simplification
to boost growth.

« The US today has the highest marginal corporate income tax rate among OECD
countries.

« Another major difference between the US and other major economies is that US
corporations are taxed on their world-wide income as opposed to territorial income.
In 2000, 17 out of the current 34 OECD members had a world-wide system. By
2010, only 7 did.

e | The combination of high corporate income tax rate and a world-wide income tax
system has two unintended consequences. One, US companies currently hold more
than $2trn in capital overseas. Two, an increasing number of US companies are
acquiring smaller foreign companies with the purpose of relocating their
headquarters outside the US (ie, inversion). Between 2003 and 2011, there were
only 7 such transactions. From 2012 and 2015, 27 such transactions were
completed.

« The valued added tax (VAT) system has been gaining popularity over the past
twenty years. Today, more than 160 countries have a VAT. The U.S. is the only
OECD country that doesn’t.

« — The fact that the US does not have a VAT system puts US produced goods at a
disadvantage. VAT is “border adjusted” - meaning that when a good is exported the
producer gets a rebate while imports are subject to VAT.

These facts together make it very apparent that both the case for tax reform and
support for tax reform are very strong. Paul Ryan said on January 26 after the
Republican retreat in Philadelphia that they “aspire” to pass tax reforms by August.

Duration preference: neutral

US 10-year (24 Oct): 1.8% (last month: 1.8%)
UBS view US 10-year (6-month forecast): 2.0%
e US 10-year yields traded largely sideways within a narrow range. Improving domestic economic and sentiment data
was balanced by concerns of the elections/fiscal cliff weighing on the US economy. However, both the ECB and the
Fed have provided substantial and credible backstops that significantly reduce tail risks. This reduces the flight to
quality and the risk discount placed on Treasuries in the event of a re-escalation of the European debt crisis. This
represents a clear floor with little chance of retesting the historical lows of July (~1.4%). In addition, the Fed's
willingness to fall behind the curve in support of the domestic labor market will increase inflation expectations over
the medium term. This implies steeper yield curves.
¢ In addition, the credible and conditional central bank backstops have already improved sentiment and should help
to kick-start growth if politicians provide the necessary tailwinds. Yields will then return to their slightly higher,
previously stable ranges over a six-month horizon (1.8%-2.1%).
e At the same time, US yields should be capped, as the US economy continues to be vulnerable to spillover effects
from the Eurozone. Structurally weak growth which will be dampened by the upcoming US fiscal consolidation, will
add to volatility and limit the increase in yields.

A Positive scenario for US bonds US 10-year (6-month range): 1.4-1.6%
¢ US fiscal deleveraging beyond our expectations weighs on the cyclical recovery and is a drag on yields.

° A re-escalation of the European debt crisis burdens yields. Implementation risks in the ECB framework remain, given
that Italy and Spain have not yet made the necessary application, which will result in the peripheral spread widening.
At the same time, Greece is likely to announce a second debt restructuring and leave the Eurozone next year.

¢ The labor market fails to recover, increasing the likelihood of even more MBS purchases or alternative measures, and
yields stay low or fall further.

& Negative scenario for US bonds US 10-year (6-month range): 2.1-2.5%
¢ If the ECB buying of short-dated Spanish and Italian sovereign bonds increases risk appetite, it would reduce the
flight to quality more substantially and this represents an upside risk to our forecasts.

Recommendations

Tactical (6 months)

e Weak global growth momentum, ongoing
bond market support from central banks
and the lingering euro crisis are likely to
keep yields at extraordinarily low levels for
some time. Tactically, we suggest a neutral
duration position.

Strategic (1 to 2 years)

e Yields have significant upside potential
over the next couple of years given the
extraordinarily low current levels of real
interest rates in particular. Thus clients
with a longer time horizon should focus
on bonds with short and medium
maturities.

IMAGES-002-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014378.txt,"Price objective basis & risk

AllianceBernstein (AB)

Our $25 price objective is based on 13x target P/E on our '17E, a discount vs our target
for asset managers as a group, based on improving but inconsistent flows and limited
active equity exposure as well as the MLP structure which means less liquidity, though a
high distribution. Upside/downside risks to our price objective are market
appreciation/depreciation, similar to other asset managers, underperformance, and an
unpredictable yield since it is based on earnings rather than fixed. Because Alliance is an
MLP, total potential return includes a variable distribution based on earnings.

Amer Express (AXP)

Our $74 price objective reflects a 13x PE multiple to our 2017 EPS estimate. Given the
elevated uncertainty, we expect AXP will trade near the low end of its historical
valuation range, which averages 12x-16x. This multiple reflects our view of solid loan
growth and better billings, offset by increased risks of rising credit and marketing costs.
We think the market will view AXP through a more credit card lens in the near-term,
which also supports a multiple at the low end of the historical range.

Upside risks to our PO are stronger than expected macroeconomic conditions,
accelerating consumer and business spending, lack of disruptions in capital markets, or a
decreasing regulatory burden. Downside potential could come from weaker than
expected macroeconomic conditions and renewed recessionary pressure, softer
consumer and business spending, disruptions in capital markets, or an increasing
regulatory burden.

Ares Management (ARES)

Our price objective (PO) for Ares is $18, which implies a target price-to-ENI (P/ENI or
P/E) multiple of 11x our 2017 ENI estimate. Our price objective is based on our sum-of-
the-parts (SOTP) analysis. Our SOTP analysis includes the following components: a
target multiple on fee related earnings (15x - in line with or a premium to asset
manager multiples given healthy growth and sticky assets), book value for the balance
sheet investments and accrued carry, and a discounted value on the performance fee
upside over a cycle (1.3x MOIC). Based on this method, we value the fee related
earnings at $13/unit, the balance sheet (principal investments and accrued carry) at
$4/unit, and the discounted value of future carry income and investment income at
$1/unit, which equates to a total value of $18.

Risks to our PO: a weak macro and capital markets backdrop, potential changes in tax
laws related to carried interest and partnerships, legal and political risk, increased
regulation, credit market disruptions, poor performance, weak fundraising, expansion
risk, key person and talent risk, competition, a unique corporate structure that limits
unitholder control, and lock ups.

Associated Banc-Corp (ASB)

We use an equal weighted three-factor valuation framework (P/E, P/TBV, DCF) to arrive
at our $20 price objective and assign a 1.4x multiple to 3Q17E TBV and a 14.9x 2017
P/E multiple, in-line with smid-cap peers due to their near median return profile. Our
DCF assumes a two-stage cost of capital of 10% and a terminal growth rate of 5%. The
upside risk to our price objective is a less onerous residential RE cycle. Downside risks
are a double dip in housing prices, deteriorating energy portfolio and falling rental
income for commercial properties.

Banc of California (BANC)

To arrive at our $15.50 price objective, we have employed a three-factor valuation
methodology that incorporates target P/E, target P/TBV and a DCF model. For our P/E
analysis, we use a 14x earnings multiple on BANC’'s 2017E core earnings below peer

It's very, very rare. I've never seen or heard of the procedure that was set up here. said McCabe, who has no
involvement in any Epstein litigation and is now a securities litigation attorney.

He's essentially avoiding federal prosecution because he can afford to pay that many lawyers to help those victims
review their cases.... If a person has no money he couldn't be able to strike a deal like this and avoid federal
prosecution.”

The back-room deal with federal prosecutors all the more interesting in light of the legal heavyweights who have
worked for Epstein, including Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz and Kenneth Starr of Clinton impeachment fame.
Lefcourt is a past president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.

Epstein's local defense attorney, Jack Goldberger, issued a statement Friday saying he had fought the release of
the sealed agreement to protect the third parties named there. Mr. Epstein has fully abided by all of its terms and
conditions. He is looking forward to putting this difficult period in his life behind him. He is continuing his long
standing history of science philanthropy...”

Epstein ended up avoiding federal charges, and pleaded guilty in state court to felony solicitation of prostitution and
procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution. In July 2008, he was sentenced to 18 months in jail, and
later allowed out up to six days a week on work release.

Epstein left the jail in late July 2009 after serving not quite 13 months of the sentence, having earned gain time for
good behavior.

Palm Beach Police began investigating the international moneyman of mystery,” as the New York magazine
dubbed him, after they received a complaint from a relative of a 14-year-old girl who had given Epstein a naked
massage at his home on the Intracoastal Waterway.

Police sought and found in poor neighborhoods a variety of tall, thin, model-like young women, who told stories of
begin recruiting, then going to Epstein's home and massaging and stimulating him. They walked away with between
$200 and $1,000.

The investigation triggered tensions between police and prosecutors, with then-Chief Michael Reiter saying in a
May 2006 letter to then-State Attorney Barry Krischer that the chief prosecutor should disqualify himself.

| continue to find your office's treatment of these cases highly unusual,” Reiter wrote. He then asked for and got
the federal investigation that ended in the sealed deal.

The Jeffrey Epstein matter was an experience of what a many-million-dollar defense can accomplish, Reiter told
the Palm Beach Daily News upon his retirement.

Confidentiality & Conditions

This is a confidential Offering Memorandum intended
solely for your limited use and benefit in determining
whether you desire to express any further interest in
the purchase of the 38.5-acre site (“the Property”).

This Offering Memorandum was prepared by
Cushman & Wakefield and Commerce Real Estate
Solutions (“Cushman & Wakefield”) and has been
reviewed by representatives of the owners of The
Property (“the Ownership”). It contains selected
information pertaining to the Property and does not
purport to be all-inclusive or to contain all of the
information that prospective purchasers may desire.
It should be noted that all information provided is
for general reference purposes only in that such
information is based on assumptions relating to the
general economy, competition, and other factors
beyond the control of Ownership and, therefore, is
subject to material variation. Additional information
and an opportunity to inspect the Property will be
made available to interested and qualified prospective
purchasers. Neither Ownership nor Cushman &
Wakefield nor any of their respective officers have
made any representation or warranty, express or
implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of this
Offering Memorandum, any of its contents, or any
other materials provided as a courtesy to facilitate
prospective purchaser’s own investigations of the
Property, and no legal commitments or obligations
shall arise by reason of this Offering Memorandum,
its contents or any further information provided by
Cushman & Wakefield regarding the Property.

It is essential that all parties to real estate transactions
be aware of the health, liability and economic impact
of environmental factors on real estate. Cushman &
Wakefield does not conduct investigations or analyses
of environmental matters and, accordingly, urges its
clients to retain qualified environmental professionals
to determine whether hazardous or toxic wastes
or substances (such as asbestos, PCB’s and other
contaminants or petro-chemical products stored in
underground tanks) or other undesirable materials
or conditions are present at the Property and, if so,
whether any health danger or other liability exists. Such
substances may have been used in the construction or
operation of buildings or may be present as a result of
previous activities at the Property.

Various laws and regulations have been enacted at
the federal, state and local levels dealing with the use,
storage, handling, removal, transport and disposal of

toxic or hazardous wastes and substances. Depending
upon past, current and proposed uses of the Property,
it may be prudent to retain an environmental expert to
conduct a site investigation and/or building inspection.
If such substances exist or are contemplated to be
used at the Property, special governmental approvals
or permits may be required. In addition, the cost
of removal and disposal of such materials may be
substantial. Consequently, legal counsel and technical
experts should be consulted where these substances
are or may be present.

Ownership and Cushman & Wakefield expressly
reserve the right, at their sole discretion, to reject any
or all expressions of interest or offers to purchase
the Property and/or terminate discussions with any
entity at any time with or without notice. Ownership
shall have no legal commitment or obligation to
any entity reviewing this Offering Memorandum or
making an offer to purchase the Property unless and
until a written commitment to purchase the Property
has been fully executed, delivered and approved
by Ownership and any conditions to Ownership’s
obligations thereunder have been satisfied or waived.
Except for representations and warranties expressly
set forth in such definitive, executed purchase and
sale agreement, Ownership makes and will make no
representations and warranties regarding the Property
and any prospective purchaser must rely entirely on
its own investigations and those of its agents and
consultants.

By receipt of this Offering Memorandum, you agree
that this Offering Memorandum and its contents are of
a confidential nature, that you will hold and treat it in
the strictest confidence, and that you will not disclose
this Offering Memorandum or any of its contents to
any other entity without the prior written authorization
of Ownership nor will you use this Offering
Memorandum or any of its contents in any fashion or
manner detrimental to the interest of Ownership or
Cushman & Wakefield.

The terms and conditions stated in this section will relate
to all of the sections of the Offering Memorandum as
if stated independently therein. If, after reviewing this
Offering Memorandum, you have no further interest
in purchasing the Property at this time, kindly return
this Offering Memorandum to Cushman & Wakefield
at your earliest possible convenience. Photocopying or
other duplication is not authorized.

Ambitious non-oil export and tourism targets, but little details
The NTP targets increasing non-oil exports by SAR145bn (US$38bn, 6.0% of GDP) to
SAR330bn (USS$88bn, 11.4% of 2020f GDP) over the next five years. Although
implementation details are lacking, we anticipate that part of the increase could be
linked to the higher mining output targeted. These would nevertheless be dependent on
the global economic cycle. Higher exports of refined oil products, if all of the additional
capacity to be installed by 2020 is exported, could add cUS$7.3bn to exports at current
price levels (but not qualify towards non-oil exports targets under the NTP as they are
classified as hydrocarbon exports). Currently, 61% of Saudi non-oil exports represents
chemicals and plastics, and maintains a correlation with oil prices, and re-exports
account for another 17% of total non-oil exports and have little added-value.

Likewise, the focus on religious tourism is appropriate given its importance in Saudi
Arabia but NTP targets appear ambitious to us with a targeted 20%yoy CAGR increase
in Umrah pilgrims. Religious tourism accounted for c40% of total tourist expenditure in
Saudi Arabia in 2015, bringing in proceeds of SAR33.4bn (US$8.9bn; 1.4% of GDP). Note
that, for balance of payment purposes, total tourism revenues stood instead at
SAR37.9bn (US$10.1bn; 1.6% of GDP). The NTP targets would thus imply religious
tourism external revenues/expenditures to increase to US$10-US$20bn (1.3-2.6% of
2020f GDP). This would be helpful on the external front but not a game changer on its
own, in our view.

Satellites: Space: the next startup frontier 
The Economist 
AROUND 1,000 operational satellites are circling the Earth, some of them the size and weight of a large car. In the past 
year they have been joined by junior offspring: 100 or so small satellites, some of them made up of one or more 10cm 
(4-inch) cubes. They may be tiny, but each is vastly more capable than Sputnik, the first man-made satellite launched 
by Russia in 1957. And many more are coming. 
Space hardware used to cost so much that it was available only to generals, multinationals and the most privileged 
scientists. No more. Many of these nanosats, as small satellites weighing no more than a few kilograms are called, 
have been launched for small companies, startups and university departments, sometimes with finance raised on 
crowdfunding websites. Their construction costs can be down in the tens of thousands of dollars, which makes them 
thousands of times cheaper than today's big satellites. Admittedly, there is much they cannot do, but with that sort of 
price differential, and some ingenious use of the abilities they do have, they could be surprisingly competitive players on 
a number of fronts. In the next five years another 1,000 nanosats are expected to be launched. 
Two trends are setting up nanosats for further success. Like people working on everything from robots to 3D printers, 
nanosat builders are harvesting the benefits of ever better, ever cheaper components built for smartphones and other 
consumer electronics. Some nanosats even contain complete smartphones, making use of the clever operating 
systems, radios and cameras which phones now contain. For as long as phones go on getting cheaper and more 
capable, so will nanosats. The cheapest so far—a tiny chipsat—was assembled for just $25, though it has yet to be 
successfully launched. 
The launch systems too are getting much cheaper. SpaceX, the innovative rocket-maker founded by Elon Musk, has 
already brought down the costs of getting into space; it and its competitors could reduce them a lot further. The biggest 
beneficiaries will at first be people who make big satellites. But more big satellites will mean more opportunities for 
small satellites to piggy-back on their launches. And some companies are looking at cheap little launch systems tailored 
specifically to the needs of the nanosatellite. One reason space engineers are notoriously conservative is that the costs 
of failure are high. As making and launching satellites gets cheaper, it will be ever easier for innovative, risk-taking 
nanosat-makers to orbit around the lumbering incumbents. 
Size does impose limits. Nanosats cannot peer as closely at the Earth or carry out as many experiments as big 
satellites. But for some jobs that does not matter. The plans that companies already have include using nanosats for 
monitoring crops, studying the sun and tracking ships and aircraft. Such a system might have been able to track 
Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, which went missing in March. 
Nano can do 
Yet not everyone is thrilled. One worry is that constellations of nanosats will mean a big increase in space junk; but, 
operating in low-Earth orbit, they burn up on re-entry after a year or so. And being cheap, they can soon be replaced 
with newer models. A more serious concern is that they are a dual-use technology: they could be used for military 
purposes. In America this has led to onerous restrictions. 
Barack Obama's administration has sensibly repealed a law of 1999 that required all satellites to be licensed by the 
State Department as munitions under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). This could mean that most 
commercial satellites will be removed from ITAR by the end of the year and their export administered by the Commerce 
Department. But some satellite systems and spacecraft—including anything that can carry people into space—will 
remain under ITAR.

Care needs to be taken with military kit, but America's regulations still seem excessive. A regular review to distinguish 
between systems that pose a real threat and ones that don't would be a help, as would better intelligence. Tight 
restrictions on new technologies will not work, and will damage America's interests: exciting new ventures like nanosats 
will simply move to countries from which they can be launched with greater ease.

Nanosatellites: Nanosats are go! 
The Economist 
ALTHOUGH widely used, satellites are expensive to build and to launch. That began to change last year. On November 
19th Orbital Sciences, an American company, launched a rocket from the Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. It carried 29 
satellites aloft and released them into low-Earth orbit, a record for a single mission. Thirty hours later, Kosmotras, a 
Russian joint-venture, carried 32 satellites into a similar orbit. Then, in January 2014, Orbital Sciences carried 33 
satellites up to the International Space Station (ISS), where they were cast off a month later. 
Many of these 94 satellites were built in a standard format known as a CubeSat, a 10cm (4 inch) cube weighing 1.3kg 
(2.91b) or less. Some comprised units of two or three cubes. After a decade of fits and starts, during which some 75 
CubeSats were launched, satellites of this scale and other small satellites are moving from being experimental kit to 
delivering useful scientific data and commercial services. 
In the next five years or so some 1,000 nanosats, as small satellites of 1-10kg are called, are expected to be launched. 
Some will be smaller than a CubeSat; others bigger and heavier. Some are like a matryoshka doll: the Russian launch 
included a satellite that launched eight smaller ones, including four PocketQubes (a 5cm cube format). One of these 
smaller satellites, developed in Peru, released its own tiny bird. 
There will be upsets along the way. In April, as part of a mission by SpaceX, an American company, to resupply the 
ISS, a small mothership was placed in orbit carrying 104 sprites (pictured below). Not much larger than a postage 
stamp, these contain all the basic elements of a satellite, such as a radio, aerials, a solar cell and instruments. 
Developed as part of a crowd-funded project called KickSat at Cornell University, each sprite cost just $25 in parts. 
Their launch was free, courtesy of NASA, the American space agency. The sprites were designed to remain in orbit for 
a few weeks collecting data before burning up on re-entry. Unfortunately, due to a fault with a timer, the mothership 
failed to release them before it burned up on re-entry. A second mission is now being planned. 
No going back 
Despite that setback, the way ahead for satellite technology is clear. You can now, with a single chip, create most of 
the capabilities that you would have found in Sputnik, but, of course, orders of magnitude faster, says Mason Peck, a 
former chief technologist at NASA and now a professor at Cornell University. 
The most ambitious project to date is a flock of 28 nanosats, each one three CubeSats in size (ie, 30cm long). These 
were carried to the ISS in January and released in batches (pictured at the beginning of this article) through a sort of 
satellite shooter developed by NanoRacks, an American company. These nanosats came from Planet Labs, a firm 
based in San Francisco. The satellites now take pictures as they scan the Earth more frequently than traditional ones 
and at a fraction of the cost, albeit at a lower resolution. 
Planet Labs, funded modestly with $65m of private investment, says its nanosats provide much of the performance of a 
conventional satellite for a fraction of the cost. That reflects a lot of antiquated technology in the space business, much 
of which can be bettered by the latest off-the-shelf equipment, says Will Marshall, Planet Labs' boss. There are other 
cost-saving measures. Satellites are usually built in elaborate clean rooms, but Planet Labs assembles its nanosats in 
clean-enough rooms in its downtown offices. The company expects to put another 100 nanosats into orbit in the next 
12 to 18 months. 
A few miles away, in another modest San Francisco office, Nanosatisfi is working on its ArduSats. These are open-
source platforms and two have already gone up. They will contain an array of sensors and can carry out various 
missions, such as locating things. More than 250,000 ships, for instance, now broadcast an automatic identification 
signal than carries about 50 nautical miles. A fleet of small satellites in low orbit could pick up these signals and provide 
frequent updates about the ships' positions without the vessels having to use costly dedicated satellite uplinks. Such a 
system might have been able to track Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, which went missing in March.

Farther south in Mountain View, Skybox captures high-resolution imaging data from its first satellite in orbit as it 
prepares another 23 to launch in the coming years. Some things, though, can be shrunk only so far and larger satellites 
are needed for a telescope to obtain the higher resolutions required for the firm's analysis. While Skybox's minisatellites 
weigh around 100kg, a fairly common size for small satellites, the firm proved its concept to investors using CubeSats. 
Being able to put something in space at very low cost allows you to demonstrate the technology to get more money, 
says Dan Berkenstock, one of the company's founders. 
The CubeSat specification came out of the academic world in the late 1990s. Bob Twiggs, then at Stanford University 
and now at Morehead State University, was frustrated by long delays on a large-satellite programme and set about 
thinking how much satellite capability might be crammed into a much smaller craft that could be launched cheaply. 
Space launches usually comprise one or more primary payloads and require ballast to balance the rocket. CubeSats, 
reasoned Mr Twiggs, could take the place of some of this ballast, so long as they did not jeopardise the main mission. 
The optimum size Mr Twiggs came up with was based on a box used to display Beanie Babies. Later, with Jordi Puig-
Suari of California Polytechnic State University, it was turned into a full specification. Mr Twiggs also developed the 5cm 
PocketQube, which has a maximum weight of 180 grammes. 
Small satellites benefit from the constant improvements in price and performance being achieved by the consumer-
electronics industry, particularly in smartphones. A typical phone is now likely to contain an accelerometer to measure 
how fast it is moving, a magnetometer to detect magnetic fields and provide a compass reading, a GPS receiver to pick 
up satellite data, multiple radios, a gyroscope to measure its position, a barometer to detect pressure, two cameras and 
much more. 
Last year the world's first phonesat went into orbit. It was a Google Nexus One smartphone incorporated into a three-
unit CubeSat called STRaND-1. This was built by Surrey Satellite Technology, a British firm that specialises in small 
satellites and which is part of the European Airbus group. The idea was to test the components of the smartphone in a 
space environment. The phone was loaded with a number of experimental apps for such things as taking photographs 
and recording magnetic fields during orbit. 
Smartphones and other consumer electronics provide a wealth of ready-made technologies that can enable a CubeSat 
to perform many of the functions of a satellite a hundred times heavier and much larger, but at substantially less cost. 
Including the launch, a nanosat of CubeSat dimensions might cost $150,000-1m, rather than $200m-1 billion for a full-
sized one. 
Low cost and a tolerance of less-stringent standards allow multiple nanosats to be built faster. This allows for a higher 
risk of failure. Nanosats have a relatively short life, which might be no more than a year or two in low-Earth orbit before 
re-entering the atmosphere and burning up. Planet Labs, for one, expects to replace some of its nanosats with new 
versions every year. 
Into space in a flash 
In an industry in which preparing some missions has taken decades, the speed at which nanosats can be developed 
and put into orbit makes the biggest in the space business take notice. NASA has also found ways to leverage the 
consumer-electronics industry, says Bruce Yost of the space agency's Ames Research Centre in California. His group 
(some former members of which founded Planet Labs) has launched five phonesats and is now planning a small fleet of 
them to experiment with communications between satellites. 
Nanosat parts are readily available to researchers. One supplier, Pumpkin, operates from a residential San Francisco 
neighbourhood. Andrew Kalman, its founder, started in 2000 selling standard components that Mr Twiggs and his 
colleagues at Stanford needed. Pumpkin now sells items ranging from brackets for a few hundred dollars up to 
complete systems for hundreds of thousands of dollars. The company has also supplied America's National 
Reconnaissance Office with 12 three-unit CubeSats to help the agency demonstrate the technology. 
Although many satellites already circle the globe taking pictures, some of the images may not be updated for days, 
months or even years. Commercial services can provide relatively rapid satellite images on demand, a number of them 
taking pictures down to a resolution of 50cm (ie, 50cm x 50cm per pixel, the legal limit in America for commercial 
satellites, although military ones can peer closer). But such satellites may cover only part of the globe each day. Once 
their fleets are complete, Planet Labs will offer images with resolutions of between 500cm to 300cm and Skybox, with 
its bigger minisatellites, 90cm. The companies will provide pictures that can be updated in hours for a variety of 
scientific and commercial applications. 
They could, for instance, be used to track environmental conditions, illegal tree-felling or changes in the course of 
rivers—which, even in their initial deployment, Planet Labs has discovered happen surprisingly often. The frequency of 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028510 
satellite passes opens up many new possibilities, says Skybox's Mr Berkenstock. His firm can offer a stream of 
analysis, such as the number of trees in a forest or the number of cars at various times of the day in parking lots across 
America. Transport patterns can be followed, infrastructure monitored, the planting of fields, plumes from smokestacks 
and ships in ports can all be observed. Overlaying more and more data will provide much richer visualisation, adds Mr 
Berkenstock. 
Nor will all the nanosats be looking downwards. Sensors facing sideways and upwards from low-Earth orbit will allow 
researchers to carry out a large number of experiments and to take measurements that have previously been too costly 
to consider. This includes detecting solar and cosmic radiation, interactions between magnetic fields and other forces 
which together make up what is called space weather. Measuring and predicting space weather could be used to 
protect billion-dollar satellites and prevent astronauts from receiving high doses of radiation. Many satellites measure 
aspects of space weather, but they tend to do so only in certain directions. Part of the failed KickSat experiment was to 
use the sprites to see if arrays of inexpensive devices could constantly monitor such forces. 
Nanosats may be inexpensive, but resisting gravity's inexorable pull comes with a price tag. Although there is no 
standard price list for a launch, a CubeSat costs roughly $100,000 to put each 1.3kg unit into low-Earth orbit. A three-
unit CubeSat might cost as much as $400,000. Jeff Foust, an analyst at Futron, a consultancy, studies launch costs 
and says he has heard of charges as low as $30,000 for a single CubeSat launched on a Russian rocket. 
These prices put nanosats in the reach not just of small firms, but also of start-ups and researchers relying on academic 
grants. Some schools are also planning nanosat experiments. Bulk-buying launches for heavier combined payloads can 
work out, per kilo, even cheaper. And these costs could come down, too. Elon Musk, SpaceX's boss, has consistently 
predicted substantial price drops in launch costs, even to as little as $200 per kilo. The firm's Falcon 9 rocket recently 
demonstrated a successful controlled descent of its booster stage, which would allow it to be reused. 
There is plenty of innovation in putting smaller payloads into space. Interorbital Systems, a Californian company, 
recently carried out a successful suborbital test flight of a small rocket (pictured right) designed to carry a 145kg 
payload. The company has presold berths for dozens of CubeSats at $13,000-38,000 per unit, as well as its own 
TubeSat format, which it offers to academia as kit and launch for $8,000. 
NASA will test an air-launched system in 2016 with Generation Orbit, an Atlanta company. It uses a Gulfstream G-IV 
executive jet to carry aloft a rocket which it fires off to put 45-50kg payloads into low-Earth orbit. NASA is also working 
with Virgin Galactic, a private space venture led by Richard Branson. Virgin Galactic has developed its LauncherOne, 
another air-launched rocket. It can be flown to a higher altitude and carry payloads up to 225kg. 
Neither Generation Orbit or Virgin Galactic may come down much on price, as both see a profit to be made in offering 
regular launches, even weekly ones. Operators whose nanosats ride shotgun as ballast in other missions do not have 
much control over when they launch or the orbits they reach, says William Pomerantz, the head of special projects at 
Virgin Galactic. John Olds, boss of Generation Orbit, says that as constellations of nanosats increase, placing them in a 
precise orbit will be critical in keeping small-satellite networks operating. 
The nanosat wars 
Nanosats also face two other limiting factors: communications and propulsion. Those used for academic work 
principally rely on amateur-radio frequencies, with basic equipment squeezed into the CubeSat form. Transmission and 
reception are further hindered by the size of antennae or dishes, both on the ground and on the satellites. Many 
academic projects set up their own listening stations and recruit space buffs who can use inexpensive kit, but these 
work on an informal basis. Companies tend to use licensed frequencies and plump for more expensive radio gear to 
handle their data flows. More development in communications equipment and investment in ground stations would 
improve things. 
The other bugbear, propulsion, is harder to solve. Currently, launch operators can prevent nanosats carrying hazardous 
propellants that might be used to power them to another orbit. Nor have engineers had a reason to design tiny 
spaceship engines using safer fuel. But they do now. Even a basic capability to push in one direction would allow 
nanosats to remain in orbit longer, or allow a satellite that has been placed into low-Earth orbit, using an inexpensive 
launch provider, to nudge itself to a higher geostationary orbit. And some might travel far beyond Earth. 
Benjamin Longmier of the University of Michigan and founder of Aether Industries, which makes equipment for high-
altitude research, has begun production of a nanosat propulsion system based on his previous work at the Johnson 
Space Station in Texas. This is a rocket that uses ionised propellants accelerated by magnetic fields. He has been able 
to scale this down to CubeSat size, using liquid water or solid iodine as the propellant. Dr Longmier says the system 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 028511 
could allow a constellation of satellites to remain in the correct position relative to one another, move satellites to polar 
orbit from less-expensive launch insertions or increase an orbit. 
Surrey Satellite Technology's STRaND-1 also contained a couple of experimental propulsion systems. One is a re-entry 
device that ejects a mixture of water and alcohol to tip the nanosat out of orbit at the end of its useful life. The other is 
an array of pulsed-plasma thrusters which heat and evaporate a material to produce a charged gas to push the satellite 
along. 
NASA has plans to offer a $5m prize using a six-unit CubeSat for groups to demonstrate ways both to communicate 
across large distances and display the effective use of unconventional propellants. Jennifer Gustetic, in charge of 
NASA's prizes, says the winner will have to show that their systems are survivable and can be operated far out into 
space. The programme is still at an early stage, but it could involve transporting the CubeSats for release into orbit 
around the Moon. But NASA has competition. Dr Longmier believes his technology can beat NASA to the Moon without 
the use of an additional spacecraft to carry the CubeSets there. And James Cutler, a satellite-propulsion expert now 
also at the University of Michigan, thinks he can propel small birds even deeper into space. Let the nanosat wars begin.

representation of his clients can serve as the basis for a civil lawsuit against him. Allegations
about Edwards’s participation in or knowledge of the use of the civil actions against Epstein in a
“Ponzi Scheme” are not supported by any competent evidence and could never be supported by
competent evidence as they are entirely false.

: A. Epstein’s Complaint

Epstein’s Second Amended Complaint essentially alleges that Epstein was damaged by
Edwards, acting in concert with Scott Rothstein (President of the Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler law
fit (“RRA”) where Edwards worked for a short period of time). Epstein appears to allege that
pabanie joined Rothstein in the abusive prosecution of sexual assault cases against Epstein to
“pump” the cases to Ponzi scheme investors. As described by Epstein, investor victims were
told by Rothstein that three minor girls who were sexually assaulted by Epstein: L.M., E.W., and
I ane Doe were to be paid up-front money to prevent those girls from settling their civil cases
against Epstein. In Epstein’s view, these child sexual assault cases had “minimal value”
(Complaint & 42(h)), and Edwards’s refusal to force his clients to accept modest settlement
offers is claimed to breach some duty that Edwards owed to Epstein. Interestingly, Epstein never
states that he actually made any settlement offers.

: The supposed “proof” of the Complaint’s allegations against Edwards includes
Edwards’s alleged contacts with the media, his attempts to obtain discovery from high-profile
persons with whom Epstein socialized, and use of “ridiculously inflammatory” language in
arguments in court. Remarkably, Epstein has filed such allegations against Edwards despite the

fact that Epstein had sexually abused each of Edwards’s clients and others while they were

current headlines, begin with the Arab world, but the answers such as
there are will, nevertheless, ultimately come in from the East. It 1s in
those Asian lands that conventional Western philosophical precepts
are challenged. The ideology by which Asian autocrats stand in
opposition to the likes of Mill and Berlin falls—to some extent—
under the rubric of Confucianism. Confucianism is more a sensibility
than a political doctrine. It stresses traditional authority, particularly
that of the family, as the sine qua non of political tranquility. The
well-being of the community takes precedence over that of the
individual. Morality is inseparable from one’s social obligation to the
kin group and the powers that be. The Western—and particularly the
American—tendency is to be suspicious of power and central
authority; whereas the Asian tendency is to worry about disorder.
Thus, it is in Asia, much more so than in the Middle East, where
autocracy can give the Western notion of freedom a good run for its
money. The fact that even a chaotic democracy is better than the rule
of a Mubarak or a Ben Ali proves nothing. But is a chaotic
democracy better than the rule of autocrats who have overseen GDP
growth rates of 10 percent annually over the past three decades? It is
in places like China, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam where good
dictators have produced economic miracles. These in turn have led to
the creation of wide-ranging personal freedoms, even as these leaders
have compelled people against their will on a grand scale. Here the
debate gets interesting.

Indeed, probably one of the most morally vexing realizations in the
field of international politics is that Deng Xiaoping, by dramatically
raising the living standard of hundreds of millions of Chinese in such
a comparatively short space of time—which, likewise, led to an
unforeseen explosion in personal freedoms across China—was,
despite the atrocity of Tiananmen Square that he helped perpetrate,
one of the great men of the twentieth century. Deng’s successors,

Foreign-Policy Failure

Dimitri K. Simes

August 24, 2011 -- PRESIDENT BARACK Obama is in many
respects the opposite of Richard Nixon and George H. W. Bush, both
foreign-policy presidents who subordinated their domestic ambitions
to America’s national-security requirements. Moreover, where
Obama has succeeded internationally, his successes have been largely
tactical rather than strategic, reflecting the fact that he 1s
fundamentally a domestic leader with a European-style socialist
agenda but little or no foreign-policy vision. This lack of an
international agenda is why the president may be called a pragmatist,
but not a realist.

One result of all this is that his administration’s foreign-policy
choices often appear substantially driven by political expediency—
and particularly a desire to avoid domestic criticism, something
apparent in both the president’s surge in Afghanistan and his later
plan for withdrawal. Another is that, lacking a vision, the
administration rarely appears to engage in long-term thinking about
the international environment, historical processes or the potential
unintended consequences of its choices. In fact, its sense of history
seems highly politicized and simplistic.

Short-term political thinking about foreign policy cannot sustain
America’s international leadership, which requires clear distinctions
between immediate tactical problems and longer-term strategic
threats. Today, most analysts agree that the greatest danger to the
United States is not from Iran, which does not yet have nuclear
weapons, or even al-Qaeda, which has been seriously damaged, but
rather from Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal. Maintaining the Pakistani

those restrictions across the country. Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of a British press magnate and Jeffrey Epstein’s close
associate when he was inviting underage girls into his bedroom, leads a TED Talk on
environmental issues.

But she points out that there has been no statute of limitations for federal sex crimes involving children since 2002.

Children who are sexually abused often take decades to reveal what happened to them, in part because their brains aren’t wired at a young age to
understand the trauma they’ve experienced, said Kenneth V. Lanning, a retired FBI agent who investigated and studied child sex crimes for 40 years.

“We want to hold children to some superhuman standard because they behave this way. In reality, police, prosecutors and judges have to understand that
children are not all angels from heaven. They are just plain human beings who are emotionally immature so we have to protect them from their own

decisions.”

Wild, who continues to fight her federal case on behalf of all of Epstein’s victims, said she hopes that the federal judge hearing the Crime Victims’ Rights
case will make a ruling soon, one that will send a message to prosecutors who fail to consider the rights of crime victims.

“Really if you think about this too hard, it’s scary because this is our government that is supposed to protect us but has done everything to protect a
pedophile,” she said.

The Miami Herald obtained thousands of FBI and court records, lawsuits, and witness depositions, and went to federal court in New York to access sealed documents in the reporting of Perversion of

Justice. The Herald also tracked down more than 60 women who said they were victims, some of whom had never spoken of the abuse before.

may waive any right to receive notice. In cases where victims choose to receive notice, presumably the notice will be properly
given the vast majority of the time. Even apart from notice requirements, most victims will be trial witnesses and therefore will
have been notified of the trial by a subpoena. Victims will also often be aware of sentencings through the work of probation
officers in preparing presentence reports. 302 Th the tiny fraction of cases where notice has not been properly provided, notice
will often be only a [*911] telephone call away. While the burdens of delaying a trial or sentencing are not trivial, Congress
has determined that the victim's rights must take precedence. Proposed subsection (b) faithfully implements that determination.

Subsection (c) of the proposed rule deals with the victim's right to attend in situations involving multiple victims. Congress has
recognized that in some cases, such as the Oklahoma City bombing case, it is impossible to afford all victims the opportunity to
attend trials. Accordingly, the CVRA provides that where the number of crime victims makes it impracticable to protect
rights for all victims, the court shall fashion a reasonable procedure to give effect to victims' interests. 3° Possible
procedures include closed-circuit transmission of the proceedings to a ceremonial courtroom, auditorium, or other facility that
can accommodate many people. To permit such transmission, an amendment to Rule 53 is proposed below. 3

Subsection (d) gives victims a general right to be heard on issues directly affecting their rights. The CVRA specifically
mandates that victims have the right to be heard with regard to release of the defendant, a plea, or a sentence. 3°° The right to
be heard at these hearings has been addressed elsewhere in these proposed rules, °° but courts will sometimes consider other
issues that directly affect victims' rights. For example, courts may consider whether to release the address and telephone
number of the victim to the defendant. 3°7 It makes little sense for the court to decide this issue without hearing from the
victim, particularly since the CVRA gives victims the right to be reasonably protected from the accused. 3°8 Subsection (d)

298 See U.S. Const. amend. V. See generally Beloof, The Third Wave of Crime Victims' Rights, supra note 16, at 303-04 (discussing double
jeopardy barriers to remedying violations of victim's rights).

299 18 U.S.C.A. 3771(d)(5).
300 See Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(c) (correction of sentence allowed only for technical or other clear error). Whether denial of a victim's right

constitutes clear error subject to correction presumably will need to be resolved in future cases. Cf. United States v. Bedonie, 413 F.3d 1126
(10th Cir. 2005) (remedying error in restitution award not permitted after imposition of sentence).

301-18 U.S.C.A. 3771(d)(5) (authorizing a victim motion to re-open a ... sentence if the victim's right to be heard was denied); see 150
Cong. Rec. $10,910 (daily ed. Oct. 9, 2004) (statement of Sen. Kyl) (discussing this provision). In light of these provisions, the Advisory
Committee may need to consider redrafting Rule 35 to allow reopening of sentences imposed in violation of victims' rights.

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027991.txt,"any other pursuing vehicle would be in no shape to follow for very long. But we
still had to avoid trouble on our way back out. I knew it would be a risk to go
back to the Coral Beach, so we took the shortest route to the sea, straight out to
the Corniche, the city’s main avenue along the Mediterranean. As we got closer,
we could hear gunfire. Obviously, the police, and the Palestinian militias,
realized something was not right. The advantage we had was that they would
have no idea what had happened on Rue Verdun, who we were, or where we
were going.

No sooner had we joined the Corniche than I saw another police Land Rover
about 200 yards ahead of us. This one had a spotlight on the roof, panning both
sides of the road. I told the driver to slow down. About 100 yards or so later,
reaching the place where we’d arranged for the SEALs to meet us, he and the
other station wagon pulled over to the side of the road. The Land Rover kept
driving. We slid down a steep embankment nearly 30 feet to the sea. Two of the
three assault teams had bags full of documents as well. We swam out to the
dinghies. When we had hoisted ourselves in, we headed out at first by paddle,
then under engine power, to the missile boat. The whole operation had taken
about a half an hour, only 10 minutes on Rue Verdun.

I radioed Manno on the way to the missile boat. A half-dozen words: the
agreed code phrase for “mission accomplished, targets achieved.” I could hear
relief in his voice when he replied. At first, | assumed that was because they
hadn’t heard from us during the operation. Our radio link to the missile boat had
gone down when we entered the built-up area around the apartment blocks.
Genuinely, despite Manno’s suspicion that I’d cut the connection. Yet he had
other reasons to exhale when he heard we had got out safely. Amnon’s team had
had a much tougher time. They met resistance from the moment they arrived at
the DFLP building. Two of his men were killed, another wounded. They set off
their explosive charges, but had to fight their way out. They only barely
managed to escape, carrying their fallen comrades with them and linking up
with another team of SEALs near the Coral Beach.

It was a little before six in the morning when I got home. I was careful not to
wake Nava. I’d changed out of my slacks and flats and surrendered my wig on
the missile boat. But I didn’t have the energy to deal with my makeup. The next
thing I remember was my wife standing by our bed as I stirred awake around
noon the next day. She looked at my eye makeup and lipstick, shook her head,
and smiled. She didn’t need to ask where I’d been. Israel radio had been full of
news about a major operation in Beirut.

The moves since Nov 8 have certainly been violent in certain asset classes. USD/JPY
stands out, but the sell-off in US treasuries has been very marked, the hit to EM fixed
income equally big, while in equity markets the outperformance of the Russell, the surge
in the US banks and the sell-off in long duration equities has been remarkable.

Some of these moves, such as stronger USD, higher yields, banks vs staples were
extensions of moves that had already begun. Others, such as Russell vs S&P, JPY, Nikkei,
were the start of new moves where 8 Nov marked a key turning point.

The moves that had already started are now getting quite stretched with US 10Y yields
up 5 standard deviations from the July low, with US Banks up by a similar amount vs
Staples. The USD/JPY move though is more like a 2 SD move, with the NKY similar (if
we exclude the 7% drop on US election day).

Peak liquidity, deflation, Inequality and globalisation —- watch for Peak Trump

So what does a Trump presidency mean for the world? Michael Hartnett, our Chief
Investment Strategist sums it up nicely with four of his seven peaks. Peak liquidity —
the era of excess liquidity is over; Peak inequality — with fiscal stimulus to address
inequality; Peak globalisation- free movement of trade, labour and capital ending, FX
wars starting; and Peak deflation — the secular low point in bond yields now behind us.
We would add a peak to that which investors need to bear in mind —- Peak Trump. What
we mean by that is at what point do the policy changes of the Trump presidency get
fully discounted in markets. We have moved pretty quickly to do that but we suspect
there is more to go, even if the quick returns have probably already been made.

If we think about these peak questions, the two that stand out to use as obvious and not
really open to challenge are Peak liquidity and Peak deflation. The Fed left its peak
liquidity position behind ages ago, the BO) has moved to yield rather than liquidity
targeting, the BOE may extend its current programme of QE one more time but then is
probably done and even the ECB is talking about tapering, even if they are unlikely to do
it in December. The Peak deflation theme follows on from this with the secular low in
bond yields surely behind us if the central banks are stepping away from flooding the
world with ever more liquidity.

Peak liquidity/deflation means higher yields - inflation expectations adjusting

The question then is how much yields will likely rise from here. Much of course depends
on how quickly inflation picks up. Markets have already moved to price in a significant
pick-up in expected inflation as the two charts below show. To our mind breakeven
inflation rates had been too low for too long, which is one reason we wanted to be
defensive in bond markets. It would seem to us that inflation expectations are now up
with events. US headline CPI at 2.5% is consistent with the Fed modestly overshooting

Loss of Export Privileges

Companies and individuals who violate the FCPA
may face consequences under other regulatory regimes,
such as the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), 22 U.S.C.
§ 2751, et seqg., and its implementing regulations, the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22
C.ER. § 120, e¢ seg. AECA and ITAR together provide
for the suspension, revocation, amendment, or denial of an
arms export license ifan applicant has been indicted or con-
victed for violating the FCPA.*” They also set forth certain
factors for the Department of State’s Directorate of Defense
Trade Controls (DDTC)*” to consider when determining
whether to grant, deny, or return without action license
applications for certain types of defense materials. One of
those factors is whether there is reasonable cause to believe
that an applicant for a license has violated (or conspired
to violate) the FCPA; if so, the Department of State “may
disapprove the application.”>” In addition, it is the policy
of the Department of State not to consider applications for
licenses involving any persons who have been convicted of
violating the AECA or convicted of conspiracy to violate
the AECA.*” In an action related to the criminal resolu-
tion of a UK. military products manufacturer, the DDTC
imposed a “policy of denial” for export licenses on three of
the company’s subsidiaries that were involved in violations

of AECA and ITAR.*”

When Is a Compliance Monitor or
Independent Consultant Appropriate?
One of the primary goals of both criminal prosecu-
tions and civil enforcement actions against companies that
violate the FCPA is ensuring that such conduct does not

occur again. As a consequence, enhanced compliance and

reporting requirements may be part of criminal and civil
resolutions of FCPA matters. The amount of enhanced
compliance and kind of reporting required varies according
to the facts and circumstances of individual cases.

In criminal cases, a company’s sentence, or a DPA or
NPA with a company, may require the appointment of an
independent corporate monitor. Whether a monitor is
appropriate depends on the specific facts and circumstances
of the case. In 2008, DOJ issued internal guidance regard-
ing the selection and use of corporate monitors in DPAs
and NPAs with companies. Additional guidance has since
been issued.” A monitor is an independent third party who
assesses and monitors a company’s adherence to the com-
pliance requirements of an agreement that was designed to
reduce the risk of recurrence of the company’s misconduct.
Appointment of a monitor is not appropriate in all circum-
stances, but it may be appropriate, for example, where a com-
pany does not already have an effective internal compliance
program or needs to establish necessary internal controls. In
addition, companies are sometimes allowed to engage in self-
monitoring, typically in cases when the company has made
a voluntary disclosure, has been fully cooperative, and has

demonstrated a genuine commitment to reform.

Factors DOJ and SEC Consider
When Determining Whether a Compliance
Monitor Is Appropriate Include:

= Seriousness of the offense
= Duration of the misconduct

  Pervasiveness of the misconduct, including
whether the conduct cuts across geographic and/
or product lines

# Nature and size of the company

 Quality of the company’s compliance program at
the time of the misconduct

# Subsequent remediation efforts

organizations.

At present, there are 10.5 million Palestinians, including around 5
millions refugees, scattered in several Middle Eastern countries and
other Diaspora states.

As for Palestinian Statehood: The UN General Assembly by great
majority has recognized the right of the Palestinian people to self
determination and statehood in more than 40 resolutions.

Most famous of these resolutions were the two issued in October,
1974: 3236 and 3237. The latter recognized the PLO as the legitimate
representative of the Palestinian people and stipulated that it would
be granted the status of Observer in all UN organs and affiliated
organizations and its sponsored conferences.

In December 15, 1988, a month after the declaration of the State of
Palestine by the PLO conference in Algiers, the UN General
Assembly decided in its resolution of December 15, 1988 to
recognize the PLO declaration of the State of Palestine and to
substitute the use of PLO for the name of Palestine in all its organs
and conferences.

UN membership

After the Oslo accords in 1993 and the failure of peace negotiations
which lasted for 18 years, the PLO intends to bring to the UN
General Assembly once again, through the UN Resolution number
377 of 1950, the issue of recognition of the State of Palestine on the
basis of the June, 1967 borders.

Such resolutions, if issued by the UN General Assembly, could have
some legal, political and media ramifications, but, nevertheless, it
will not have any practical impact on the Israeli Government and
some of its allies.

The State of Palestine will still lack a major element of a sovereign
state: That is the effective control over territory and population.
This can only be achieved when the Israeli occupation is compelled

“Did you steal anything?” he asked furtively. | took my watch out of my
pocket since | didn't like to wear it on my wrist, and without saying a word
| placed it on the bureau. Lenny laughed one loud staccato “Ha” and
kissed me on the forehead.

We developed a friendship integrated with stand-up comedy. In_ his
act Lenny had broken through traditional stereotypical jokes about
airplane food, nagging wives, Chinese drivers, annoying mothers-in-law.
Instead he weaved his taboo-breaking targets--teachers' low salaries
versus show-business celebs, religious leaders’ hypocrisy, cruel abortion
laws, racial injustice, the double standard between illegal and prescription
drugs--into stream-of-consciousness vignettes.

In each succeeding performance, he would sculpt and re-sculpt his
concept into a theatrical context, experimenting from show to show like a
verbal jazz musician. Audience laughter would sometimes turn into
clapping for the creative process itself. “Please don't applaud,” he’ d

request. “It breaks my rhythm.”

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018443.txt,"You Love Is Kinky by Dossie Easton and Catherine W. Liszt. I've also heard good things
about the Parents of Alternative Sexuality” pamphlet by Dr. Amy Marsh.

If you, like me, are particularly attracted to the idea of needle piercing, there's a great
book called Play Piercing by Deborah Addington.

If you're more interested in getting a feel for common BDSM philosophies and what the
BDSM community is like -- an anthropological perspective, one might say -- then there's
a book by Mark Thompson called Leatherfolk, and a newer one by Staci Newmahr called
Playing at the Edge.

Well-known feminist BDSM theory authors from the generation ahead of me include Pat
Califia and Gayle Rubin, who are both brilliant.

Online

I usually direct total newbies to this BDSM 101 page by Franklin Veaux:
http://www.xeromag.com/fvbdsm.html

As it happens, the same writer has a good Polyamory 101, too: http://www.xeromag.com/
fvpoly.html

There are a lot of websites on BDSM, and they aren't all carefully edited or moderated; so
if you can manage it, then I suggest you try to get hold of one of the above how-to books.
That said... overall, one of the best online BDSM resources is FetLife.com, the kinky
social networking site. Once you have an account, you can join a huge variety of
discussion groups about BDSM. FetLife is not a dating site; it's more like a kinky
Facebook (seriously). I think that there are important problems with how FetLife is
structured. For example, there's no way to search for past topics, which is ridiculous; this
means that the research process for finding discussions is incredibly weird. The BDSM
activist maymay has written intelligently about many issues with FetLife:

http://maybemaimed.com/2011/03/20/fetlife-considered-harmful/
But the fact remains that FetLife is a huge gathering place.

Another good online resource is the amazing sex education site Scarleteen.com.
Scarleteen offers a ton of advice on a ton of sexual topics, and has its own message
boards.

The site KinkAcademy.com has received some good reviews, and features video tutorials
by some people who are pretty well-known in the community. You have to buy a
membership, though.

The BDSM writer Ranai from Germany has labored long and hard to make an amazingly
comprehensive, international, multilingual directory of kink resources. I haven't gone
through it extensively, but every time Ranai comments on my blog she's brilliant, so I'm
sure her directory is brilliant too. Here's the directory: http://ranai.wordpress.com/kink-
resources/

There are so many BDSM blogs that I could never count them all. I want to direct special
attention to Kink Research Overviews, an abandoned but still excellent blog that profiles
the sparse and scattershot research on BDSM: http://kinkresearch.blogspot.com/2009/10/

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017016.txt,"II.3. Construction of historical n-grams corpora

IJ.3A. Creation of a digital sequence of 1-grams and extraction of n-gram
counts

All input source texts were first converted into UTF-8 encoding before tokenization. Next, the text of each
book was tokenized into a sequence of 1-grams using Google’s internal tokenization libraries (more
details on this approach can be found in Ref. $4). Tokenization is affected by two processes: (i) the
reliability of the underlying OCR, especially vis-a-vis the position of blank spaces; (ii) the specific
tokenizer rules used to convert the post-OCR text into a sequence of 1-grams.

Ordinarily, the tokenizer separates the character stream into words at the white space characters (\n
[newline]; \t [tab]; \r [carriage return]; ““ [space]). There are, however, several exceptional cases:

(1) Column-formatting in books often forces the hyphenation of words across lines. Thus the word
“digitized”, may appear on two lines in a book as digi-<newline>ized. Prior to tokenization, we look for 1-
grams that end with a hyphen ('-') followed by a newline whitespace character. We then concatenate the
hyphen-ending 1-gram to the next 1-gram. In this manner, digi-<newline>tized became “digitized”. This
step takes place prior to any other steps in the tokenization process.

(2) Each of the following characters are always treated as separate words:
! (exclamation-mark)

@ (at)

% (percent)

4 (caret)

* (star)

two teenagers named Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak to start their first company to
build and sell little phreaking boxes. Woz later recalled nervously meeting the Cap’n
one day in California. He was a strange, slightly smelly, and extremely intense
nomadic engineer. “I do it for one reason and one reason only,” the Cap’n huffed to
the writer of that Esquire article, who was a bit baffled why a grown man would find
whistling into phones so appealing. “I'm learning about a system. The phone
company is a System. A computer is a System. Do you understand? If 1 do what I do,
itis only to explore a System. Computers. Systems. That's my bag,” he said. “The
phone company is nothing but a computer.1°

I'd heard about the Amsterdam conference in the 2600 hacking circles, somewhere
between the debates about circuit boards and which company was best for the
relatively new service of email. The gathering was organized by group of Dutch
computer geeks who published their own magazine, Hack-Tic. I sent an email to the
founders. One of them, a man with the improbably exotic name Rop Gonggrijp, sent
back an irresistible reply. “On August 4, 5t and 6 we’re organizing a three-day
summer congress for hackers, phone phreaks, programmers, computer haters, data
travelers, electro-wizards, networkers, hardware freaks, techno-anarchists,
communications junkies, cyberpunks, system managers, stupid users, paranoid
androids, Unix gurus, whizz kids, warez dudes, law enforcement officers
(appropriate undercover dress required), guerilla heating engineers and other
assorted bald, long-haired and/or unshaven scum,” the invitation began. Data
travelers? Electro-wizards? Warez dudes? | had to go. “Also included,” the note
continued, “are inspiration, transpiration, a shortage of showers (but a lake to swim
in), good weather (guaranteed by god), campfires and plenty of wide open space
and fresh air.”

In those early days of the Internet, there was only the barest tickle of a commercial
instinct at work. If anything, most of the people at places like 2600 or Hack-Tic were
profoundly anti-commercial. They were hobbyists, as entranced by role-playing
games like Dungeons and Dragons as by their clapped-together, often unreliable
digital machines. It was no accident that firms like Apple had emerged from groups
with names like The Homebrew Computer Club, names that suggested a rooty, self-
defining hippy ethos. Everyone you met in that world fell pretty squarely into one of
those weird-by-weirder categories Rop Gonggrijp had listed in his email. Their
relaxed, nerdish temperament was reflected in the design of the Internet itself -
open, generous, easy to manipulate, emotional at times in debates over protocols,
freedom loving. The net design was, as well, a reaction against the systems that
troubled all of us most. Like AT&T, say, which was closed, stingy, and tough
(therefore enjoyable) to manipulate.

Jon Postel, the American engineering and programming genius who had helped
write some of the essential original protocols of the Internet, summed up this point

indeed, it went viral.

Coincidentally, on the same night that Tosh, in his signature
Sarcastic approach to reality, provoked the woman, Sarah Silverman was
performing at Foxwords Casino, and she touched upon the same taboo
subject: “We need more rape jokes. We really do. Needless to say, rape,
the most heinous crime imaginable, seems it’ sacomic’ s dream, though.
It' s because it seems when you do rape jokes, that the material is so
dangerous and edgy, and the truth is, it’ s like the safest area to talk
about in comedy‘ cause who’ s gonna complain about a rape joke? Rape
victims? They don’ t even report rape. They’ re just traditionally not

complainers.”

Ironically, in 7he Aristocrats, a documentary entirely about a classic
joke of the same name, Silverman complained (facetiously) that she was
once raped by show-biz legend Joe Franklin. Also, her rape tips for men
include, Carry a rape whistle. If you find that you are about to rape
someone, blow the whistle until someone comes to stop you. However,
another joke of hers goes like this: “Il was raped by a doctor—which is so

bittersweet for a Jewish girl.”

Creating a scientific community

The Comprehension
Challenge

The task of the Structure of Mental Representation initiative will
at first consist in the creation of a large and competitive
community, built around a set of benchmark problems.

I suggest picking a set of problems that covers most of the
above architectural requirements: the comprehension of
dynamic visual sequences (movies) and narratives. The
evaluation of comprehension may focus both on a discourse
level (asking the system general and specific questions about
the consumed visuals or narratives) and directly, by producing
dynamic renderings and depictions of knowledge represented
within the system. At least on the discourse level, a direct
comparison to the functional properties of child performance
at different cognitive stages is possible.

Turning the benchmark task into a regular competition allows a
direct comparison between models, and offers a strong
incentive for exchange of solutions among research groups. The
need to for broad solutions with given material and intellectual
resources will enforce a higher degree of the reuse of code and
ideas than we currently see in AJ architectures (outside of
robotic soccer, where such competitions have turned out to be
highly successful).

By structuring the comprehension tasks into different levels
and sub-domains (such as basic language acquisition tasks,
grammar, perceptual and logical tasks, social reasoning/theory
of mind, affective evaluation, constructive problem solving, use
of analogies and metaphor etc.), we can formulate consistent
long-term goals and realistic short-term problems.

The Formation of a Pilot Team

To pull the Structure of Mental Representation initiative off the
ground, we will need to create a pilot team, which is the object
of this proposal. The pilot team has the following tasks:

- Bring a critically sized group of people together, with a
well-defined set of shared goals

- Formulate an initial set of hypotheses

- Bring these in the context of an existing or hypothetical
cognitive architecture, so specifications can be derived

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014719.txt,"2. From a panel discussion last week:

° Woo actually disagrees with some people’s view that there is euphoria in the market. With real yields at -30bp,
the fixed income market is pricing in pessimism on Trump (and as I’ve mentioned, our colleagues in fixed income/FX and
their clients have been quite a bit more bearish than those in equities.)

° Believes there is fear of stagflation in the market, while gold going through the roof on worries of inflation.

e However, if the USS strengthens by 25%, it will be deflationary. Dangerous for EM countries loaded in USS debt,
esp in the wake of boarder adjustment tax reform talk.

e Tax reform is the only thing that matters.

oO US companies have $2-2.5trn of dormant cash sitting on their B/S outside of the US to avoid paying tax.

3) US is the only OECD country without a VAT tax.

3) What needs to happen is: implement a VAT tax that is border adjusted, and fix corporate tax rate. This will not
only boost US economy, but will give a jolt to the world economy as well.

3) Positive that there is a solution, reform momentum on tax is strong regardless of political affiliation. There is a
road out of the quagmire.

3) Question is: why when most other issues are getting leaked out of the White House, information on tax reform

is not being leaked at all? Could it be a sign that the administration believes it is that important, and trying not to mess
up on execution? [Or you could argue that there is nothing to leak at this point!]

3) On timing of tax reform: It is crucial we get a blue print of tax reform in the next 2-3 weeks [now 1-2 weeks],
because Congress would like to raise debt ceiling while discussing tax reform before summer recess.

3) July 29th is start of summer recess, which means need to pass by May, requiring the bill proposal to be ready by
March. Therefore, in the next few weeks, we need to see progress for an August deadline.

3) On personal income tax, Trump and Obama are actually on the same page in terms of taxing the wealthy.

° US banks have $100bn of excess capital in reserve: beyond what they need. Next big growth area for US banks is
commercial banking loans. Growth driver for US economy will be easy access to credit

° Ryan-Brady Tax Blueprint released in 2016 - not many have actually read it, but many of the corporate clients
seem better informed than hedge fund investors on this topic of late.

e Rates: Just two weeks ago, the market was putting a less than 20% chance of a March 15th rate hike, vs now, it
is priced in at an 86% chance. At this point, equities will sell off if no hike.

e Fed will not hike in May ahead of French elections.

3. David Woo’s latest “Cause and Effect” is attached

4. David Woo’s Top Rates and FX Trades for 2017 is also attached. Woo believes that Brexit and the US election

have signaled that the world has changed. These ground shifts have been brought on by a backlash to globalization,
increasingly viewed as the culprit for wage stagnation, growing disparity of income and wealth between the rich and the
poor, and the loss of national identity. For the year ahead, we recommend being bearish 5y US rates (seeing higher
yields), long USDJPY (weaker JPY) and short a basket of EM LatAm long bonds (Mexico, Brazil and Colombia). But in the
near term, we urge caution with the reflation trade. Short 10y US real rates (seeing higher yields) offers the best risk-
reward after recent moves.

Splitting up Banks

I started to write a book on banks and money a year ago. I stopped when | realized
that I don’t know enough about the subject. I have some experience and have done
some reading in those fields, but not enough to justify a whole book. A chapter, or

part of a chapter, is more like it.

Sumerian temples doubled as banks, mostly for agricultural loans to finance the next
crop. It is from their records, in clay tablets, that we know they understood

compound interest and the capitalization formula.

Deposit-and-lend banks as we know them today emerged in Venice and other
European cities in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Chapter 1 said that equity
investors cannot be attracted at leverage (deposit/equity) of less than 10:1, that
even one tenth so much leverage is unstable in high winds, and that we rebuild the
banking system after every systemic failure because we blamed the high winds

rather than the rickety structure.

I said that the solution is to split up banks as we know them into deposit banks
which invest in ETFs on the one side, and lending banks which raise funds from
investors rather than depositors on the other. These entities would have separate

stockholders, and would not interact unless incidentally.

A different kind of bank split-up has been urged since the 2008 crash. Repeal of the
Glass-Steagle act had allowed commercial (deposit-and-lend) banks to operate as
investment banks (brokerage firms). Many blamed the crash on that repeal, and on
investment bank innovations such as mortgage-backed securities. I think those
critics are looking in the wrong direction. The problem, as with most bank crashes
over the centuries, was overleverage encouraged by nearly costless deposits. The

solution is not to peel off brokerage operations from the mix, but to peel off deposits.

legislative history because the CVRA ‘is un-
ambiguous.’’ Response of the United States,
In re Antrobus, No. 08-4002, at 12 n.7 (10th Cir.
Feb. 12, 2008).

At the time that the Justice Department
filed this brief, no Court of Appeals agreed
with the Tenth Circuit. At the time, three
other Circuits had all issued unanimous rul-
ings that crime victims were entitled to reg-
ular appellate review. See In re W.R. Huff
Asset Mgmt. Co., 409 F.3d 555, 562 (2d Cir. 2005);
Kenna v. US. Dist. Ct. for the Cent. Dist. of Ca.,
435 F.3d 1011, 1017 (9th Cir. 2006); In re Walsh,
229 Fed.Appx. 58, at 60 (8rd Cir. 2007).

My next question for you is, given that the
Justice Department has an obligation to use
its ‘‘best efforts,’’ 18 U.S.C. §38771(c)(1), to af-
ford crime victims their rights, how could
the Department argue in Antrobus (and later
cases) that the CVRA ‘‘unambiguously”’ de-
nied crime victims regular appellate protec-
tions of their rights when three circuits had
reached the opposite conclusion?

GOVERNMENT'S RIGHT TO ASSERT ERROR
DENIAL OF VICTIMS’ RIGHTS

To further bolster protection of crime vic-
tims’ rights, Congress also included an addi-
tional provision in the CVRA—$§3771(d)(4)—
allowing the Justice Department to obtain
review of crime victims’ rights issues in ap-
peals filed by defendants: ‘‘In any appeal in
a criminal case, the Government may assert
as error the district court’s denial of any
crime victim’s right in the proceeding to
which the appeal relates.’ 18 U.S.C.
§3771(d)(4). The intent underlying this provi-
sion was to supplement the crime victims’
appeal provision found in §3771(d)(3) by per-
mitting the Department to also help develop
a body of case law expanding crime victims’
rights in the many defense appeals that are
filed. It was not intended to in any way nar-
row crime victims’ rights to seek relief
under §3771(d)(3). Nor was it intended to bar
crime victims from asserting other remedies.
For instance, it was not intended to block
crime victims from taking an ordinary ap-
peal from an adverse decision affecting their
rights (such as a decision denying restitu-
tion) under 28 U.S.C. §1291. Crime victims
had been allowed to take such appeals in var-
ious circuits even before the passage of the
CVRA. See, e.g., United States v. Kones, 77
F.3d 66 (8rd Cir. 1996) (crime victim allowed
to appeal restitution ruling); United States v.
Perry, 360 F.8d 519 (6th Cir. 2004) (crime vic-
tims allowed to appeal restitution lien
issue); Doe v. United States, 666 F.2d 43, 46 (4th
Cir. 1981) (crime victim allowed to appeal
rape shield ruling).

As I explained at the time the CVRA was
under consideration, this provision supple-
mented those pre-existing decisions by
“allow[ing] the Government to assert a vic-
tim’s right on appeal even when it is the de-
fendant who seeks appeal of his or her con-
viction. This ensures that victims’ rights are
protected throughout the criminal justice
process and that they do not fall by the way-
side during what can often be an extended
appeal that the victim is not a party to.’’ 150
Conc. REC. $4270 (Apr. 22, 2004) (statement of
Sen. Kyl).

I have heard from crime victims’ advocates
that the Department has not been actively
enforcing this provision. Indeed, these advo-
cates tell me that they are unaware of even
a single case where the Department has used
this supplemental remedy. My final ques-
tion: Is it true that the Department has
never used this provision in even a single
case in the more than six years since the
CVRA was enacted?

Sincerely,
JON KYL,
U.S. Senator.

HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES

SERGEANT VORASACK T. XKAYSANA

Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, it is
with a heavy heart that I rise today to
honor the life and heroic service of
SGT Vorasack T. Xaysana. Sergeant
Xaysana, assigned to the Headquarters
and Headquarters Company, 2nd Bat-
talion, based in Fort Hood, TX, died on
April 10, 2011. Sergeant Xaysana was
serving in support of Operation New
Dawn in Kirkuk, Iraq. He was 30 years
old.

A native of Westminster, CO, Ser-
geant Xaysana enlisted in the Army in
2005. During over 6 years of service, he
distinguished himself through his cour-
age and dedication to duty. Sergeant
Xaysana’s exemplary service quickly
won the recognition of his commanding
officers. He earned, among other deco-
rations, the Iraq Campaign Medal, the
Global War on Terrorism Service
Medal, and the Army Good Conduct
Medal.

Sergeant Xaysana worked on the
front lines of battle, serving in the
most dangerous areas of Iraq. Mark
Twain once said, ‘‘The fear of death fol-
lows from the fear of life. A man who
lives fully is prepared to die at any
time.” Sergeant Xaysana’s service was
in keeping with this sentiment—by
selflessly putting country first, he
lived life to the fullest. He lived with a
sense of the highest honorable purpose.

At substantial personal risk, he
braved the chaos of combat zones
throughout Iraq. Though his fate on
the battlefield was uncertain, he
pushed forward, protecting America’s
citizens, her safety, and the freedoms
we hold dear. For his service and the
lives he touched, Sergeant Xaysana
will forever be remembered as one of
our country’s bravest.

To Sergeant Xaysana’s parents,
Thong Chanh and Manithip, and to his
entire family, I cannot imagine the
sorrow you must be feeling. I hope
that, in time, the pain of your loss will
be eased by your pride in Vorasack’s
service and by your knowledge that his
country will never forget him. We are
humbled by his service and his sac-
rifice.

GRAZING IMPROVEMENT ACT

Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise
today to submit for the REcoRD an ar-
ticle written by Karen Budd-Falen and
published May 28, 2011, in the Wyoming
Livestock Journal. The article’s title is
“Leveling the Playing Field: Support
for the Grazing Improvement Act of
2011.”’

The title of the article is instructive.
Anyone living and working in rural
communities knows the playing field is
not level. The National Environmental
Policy Act has become the preferred
tool to delay and litigate grazing per-
mit renewals for American ranchers.

Livestock grazing on public lands has
a strong tradition in Wyoming and all
Western States. Ranchers are proud

stewards of the land, yet the permit-
ting process to renew their permits is
severely backlogged due to litigation
aimed at eliminating livestock from
public land.

During times of high unemployment
and increasing food prices, we need to
be encouraging jobs in rural economies.
We need to be fostering an environ-
ment to raise more high quality, safe,
American beef and lamb; not litigating
less.

That is why I introduced the Grazing
Improvement Act of 2011. This legisla-
tion will provide the certainty and sta-
bility public grazing permit holders
desperately need in order to continue
supporting rural jobs, providing
healthy food, and maintaining open
spaces for recreation and wildlife.

It is time to help level the playing
field for hard working ranching fami-
lies across the West. Their livelihood
should not be held hostage by litiga-
tion and anti-grazing special interest
groups. I thank my colleagues, Sen-
ators ENZI, CRAPO, HATCH, HELLER,
RIScH, and THUNE, in supporting ranch-
ing families and this legislation.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the REcorpD the
article to which I referred.

There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the
RECORD, as follows:

LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD: SUPPORT FOR
THE GRAZING IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2011
(By Karen Budd-Falen)

If jobs and the economy are the number
one concern for America, why are rural com-
munities and ranchers under attack by rad-
ical environmental groups and overzealous
federal regulators?

America depends upon the hundreds of
products that livestock provide, yet radical
groups and oppressive regulations make it
almost impossible for ranchers to stay in
business. Opposition to these jobs comes in
the form of litigation by radical environ-
mental groups to eliminate grazing on public
lands, radical environmental group pressure
to force “voluntary” grazing permit buy-
outs from “willing sellers,’’ and holding per-
mittees hostage to the court deference given
to regulatory ‘‘experts.” The playing field is
not level and the rancher is on the losing
side. The Grazing Improvement Act of 2011
will level the playing field. I urge your sup-
port.

The Grazing Improvement Act of 2011 does
the following:

1. Term of Grazing Leases and Permits.
Both BLM and Forest Service term grazing
permits are for a 10-year term. This bill ex-
tends that term to 20 years. This extension
does not affect either the BLM’s or Forest
Service’s ability to make interim manage-
ment decisions based upon resource or other
needs, nor does it impact the preference
right of renewal for term grazing permits or
leases.

2. Renewal, Transfer and Reissuance of
Grazing Leases and Permits. This section
codifies the various ‘‘appropriation riders”
for the BLM and Forest Service requiring
that permits being reissued, renewed or
transferred continue to follow the existing
terms and conditions until the paperwork is
complete. Thus, the rancher is not held hos-
tage to the ability of the agency to get its

optimistic on the outlook for both its mortgage businesses — warehouse lending
and MCA businesses Management expects both these portfolios in aggregate to
total 28-33% of average total loan portfolio. Management tried to debunk the
perception that the MCA business was cannibalizing its warehouse lending business
and noted that two business were complimentary in nature. Moreover, while initially
the vast majority of the MCA customers were the ones that TCBI had a relationship
on the warehouse lending side, it noted that that number had fallen to 50% and is
likely to move lower over the coming quarters. TCBI has a dedicated sales force
prospecting for the MCA business.

= Next rate hike to give a bigger boost to EPS: Management noted its high asset
sensitivity with most of their loans tied to LIBOR and prime and its expectations for
an increase in funding costs to remain relatively tempered. With strong demand
deposit growth during the year and a $1bn reduction in loans with floors (from
$3.1bn to $2bn), TCBI has become more asset sensitive relative to last year, when a
rate hike led to a $4mn increase in spread income. Management expects a Dec rate
hike to boost spread income by more than $4mn a quarter.

= Remains cautious around CRE lending: Management noted that it intends to grow
CRE more slowly as it de-risks the portfolio and until it sees a turn in the cycle.
However, management is optimistic on the credit quality of CRE, particularly noting
that trends in its Houston real estate portfolio (Houston special mention loans are
1% of Houston CRE) continue to be fairly benign.

The Raleigh is different from most properties in South Beach, with a Starting

vibe that's more Deco cool than decked out to the nines. A stay here Thursday 4/8 at
feels a bit like a trip to the 1940s - dressed in whites one minute, casual

the next. It's all about lounging in style by the pool, which has hosted 8pm BST
everything from Esther Williams swimming routines to Chanel's cruise =

only. It treats all growth at the collective scale as free and exogenous.

Testing Next Generation Theory

The proxies for the pure consumption rate (Schultz’ pure consumption over total
capital) in security markets would be dividend yield for equities, and interest for
debt claims. Ibbotson Associates’ SBII (2012), Chapter 4, shows average real
interest on U.S. corporate bonds as 3.0% over the period 1926-2011. Real corporate
dividend yield rate over the period can be estimated from the same source at about
2.9%. Jeremy Siegel’s Stocks for the Long Run (2002), Table 1-2, reports data
extending back to 1802. Real return over the period 1802 - 2001 is shown as
averaging 3.5% for long-term governments, and 2.9% for short-term governments.

Corporate bond returns would have run somewhat higher.

Global Financial Data shows stock market information for 95 countries. Data for U.K.,
U.S., Germany, Australia and France begin from 1701, 1801, 1870, 1883 and 1896
respectively. My charts and tables, and my website Free Growth and Other Surprises,

show this information along with evidence for free growth.

The eighteenth century is represented by U.K. alone. U.K. then showed real price
return, dividend yield and total return at 21.4%, 7.9% and 29.3%. Volatility of
dividend yield was exceptional. From 1801 forward, U.K. averages for these flows
were 2.2%, 4.2% and 6.4%. U.S. figures from 1801 forward were 2.9%, 5.3% and
8.3%. Global Financial Data also shows collective flows for Europe and the world
since 1926. Here the figures were 3.3%, 3.9% and 7.3% for Europe, and 3.5%, 3.8%
and 7.3% for the world.

Modeling of the pure consumption rate before the emergence of security markets
could refer to the history of interest rates alone. Interest is rate of return to senior

claims. Rate of return to any claim is realization by investors net of all expense.

is not intended. Made weird. Hacking is, after all, a kind of perverse programming. It
involves slipping inside a target machine, and then driving it to do things it wasn’t
intended to do, by giving it instructions its designers never knew it might receive.13¢
The process of developing and using computer bugs, Bratus found, is not unlike the
most sophisticated software research. Hacker follow careful patterns. The best of
them really conceive of whole systems in the way the finest data architects might.
They look for particular designs, weaponize their code with a delicate elegance and
aim relentlessly at total control. A normal machine does what you tell it. A weird
machine does what someone else commands it to do.

How is such a system born? Well, a potential software hole of the sort that produces
a “Weird Machine” might be as simple as a failure to secure computer code after it is
compiled - sort of like not locking the door on your house after you leave - ora
programming oversight that means a machine can’t handle unexpected inputs. Take
the technique of “fuzzing”, for example, a famously effective way to turn a normal
machine into a weird one. The process involves confusing a digital security system
by throwing unexpected data into normal, apparently safe-looking procedures like
logging into a mail system or transferring money by wire. Think of all the
“username” and “password” forms you see when you're on the Internet. In a fuzzing
attack, instead of placing a legitimate user name or email address in a registration
field, hackers might add some unexpected characters known to cause a system to
cough up a confused response. If you type in, joe@user.com!” instead of
joe@user.com as the machine expects, the /’ at the end of the address can baffle and
stall a mis-programmed device. In some cases, that hiccup opens a vulnerability. A
proficient programmer can then order the dazed computer, for instance, to opena
door to the root of the system. It’s as if you could walk up to the teller at your local
bank and shout “Xhsuhgnnsh!!” at her when she asks how you are doing - and in her
confusion she lets you into the safe. You’ve made a weird machine of your bank.

System designers in later generations have become much more sophisticated in
trying to avoid such problems, not least because they’ve so often fingered the
embarrassing or costly aftermath of these kinds of holes in their own code. “You do
not understand how your program really works until it has been exploited,” Bratus
has said, a sentiment that hints at the stomach-lurching moment many coders and
their suddenly victimized users have now had.1%7 You don’t understand yourself until
you've been pwned. The odds that the endless possible glitches can ever be
completely patched is honestly zero. Hackers continue to use classic exploits like

This is true of the relative difficulty that
people have seeing other minds
compared to one’s own, in ways that are
sometimes very subtle and surprising.
For instance, we tend to evaluate
ourselves by consulting our mindful
intentions, but we evaluate others (and
their intentions) by observing their
actions. We may consider ourselves to
be conscientious if we planned to buy
our spouse a birthday gift, but need to
see an actual gift to infer that our spouse
is equally conscientious. * We tend to
believe that we are more likely to
experience complicated mental emotions
like shame, guilt, or embarrassment than
are others.” We tend to believe that our
own behavior will therefore be guided
by moral sentiments like empathy, guilt,
or compassion whereas others’ behavior
is more likely driven by the relatively
mindless motives of self-interest.° Other
minds are more opaque than our own,
and some learning, attending, seeking,
and projecting is required for our brains
to become fully social and see into them.
Here’s how’.

Learning. Children do not enter
the world able to think about other
minds, but they learn to do so fairly
quickly. At around three months of age,
children start preferentially attending to
animate objects compared to inanimate
objects, and at around six months of age
start to distinguish between intentional
(goal-directed) and unintentional
(accidental) action. At this age, for
instance, children will look reliably
longer at a person who is reaching for a
cup than to a person who is making the
same reaching motion in the absence of
acup. Over the next 18 months,
children become more likely to mimic
intentional than unintentional actions’, to
follow the gaze of another person and

Page |95

therefore share his or her attentional
focus, and recognize that other people
may have preferences that differ from
one’s own. By age two, children’s
social ability to read other minds seems
to have already surpassed that of our
nearest primate relatives, and over the
next two years they pick up what appear
to be uniquely human mind-reading
capacities. By age five, children
demonstrate the most sophisticated of
mind-reading abilities—the capacity to
recognize that others’ beliefsS may differ
from one’s own and to use those
differing (sometimes mistaken) beliefs to
predict the other agent’s behavior.
Variability from age five onward comes
from learning more specific details about
how other minds actually work, largely
gathered from personal experience,
religious practice, or broader cultural
norms.

Many psychologists and
neuroscientists speculate that learning to
read other minds comes from the deeply
social tendency, present at birth, to
mimic others’ actions. For example,
Steve Small examines a neurological
underpinning for mimicry, and Jean
Decety argues in his essay that an inborn
capacity for mimicry underlies the
human capacity for empathy. Looking
where others look and copying their
actions is a reasonable way to copy their
likely mental states as well. This
egocentric method of using one’s own
mental experience as a guide to other
minds continues to be employed
throughout adulthood, and can give
insight into others’ mental states but can
also lead people to overestimate the
extent to which others’ minds are similar
to one’s own. These biases tend to be
called egocentric when reasoning about
other people, and they tend to be called
anthropomorphic when reasoning about

Cadogan Tate, the world class art moving, storage and shipping specialist in contemporary art, has sponsored the
‘New Sensations 2010’ exhibition for UK art students. Organised by Channel 4 and The Saatchi Gallery, this
prestigious event aims to discover the most imaginative and talented artists graduating from BA and MA courses
in the UK and to support students leaving art college.

A total of 20 students were shortlisted to present their work in the exhibition. This is being held at Boswall
House, 2 Cornwall Terrace - a magnificent 18th century building off Regent's Park - from 14th to 20th October.
The event forms part of ‘The House of the Nobleman’, under the curatorship of Wolfe von Lenkiewicz and Victoria
Golembiovskaya.

Four of the finalists in New Sensations 2010 - Pablo Wendel, Katie Surridge, Nika Neelova and Ula Wiznerowicz -
have each been given a bursary to develop a new work for the exhibition. A short film about each of them was
aired on Channel 4 in early October.

Stephen Glynn, Cadogan Tate's Fine Art Director, comments: “We are delighted to be the sponsors of this
important exhibition, which showcases the talent of some remarkable young artists. We have spent many years
transporting and storing the world's most precious contemporary art for leading museums, galleries and
collectors. It therefore seemed very appropriate that we should support and encourage the UK's leading art

students through this exciting event.”

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022567.txt,"Assume the following additional facts:

Under its company policy for a government transaction of this size, Company A requires both finance and compliance
approval. The finance officer is concerned that the discounts to Distributor are significantly larger than what they have
approved for similar work and will cut too deeply into Company A's profit margin. The finance officer is also skeptical about
including Local Partner to perform some of the same services that Company A is paying Distributor to perform. Unsatisfied
with Sales Executive's explanation, she requests a meeting with Distributor and Principal 1. At the meeting, Distributor
and Principal 1 offer vague and inconsistent justifications for the payments and fail to provide any supporting analysis, and
Principal 1 seems to have no real expertise in the industry. During a coffee break, Distributor comments to Sales Executive
that the finance officer is naive about “how business is done in my country.” Following the meeting, Sales Executive
dismisses the finance officer's concerns, assuring her that the proposed transaction structure is reasonable and legitimate.
Sales Executive also reminds the finance officer that “the deal is key to their growth in the industry.”

The compliance officer focuses his due diligence on vetting Distributor and Local Partner and hires a business investigative
firm to conduct a background check. Distributor appears reputable, capable, and financially stable and is willing to take on
real risk in the project, financial and otherwise. However, the compliance officer learns that Distributor has established an
off-shore bank account for the transaction. The compliance officer further learns that Local Partner’s business was organized
two years ago and appears financially stable but has no expertise in the industry and has established an off-shore shell
company and bank account to conduct this transaction. The background check also reveals that Principal 1 is a former college
roommate of a senior official of the Ministry of Immigration. The Sales Executive dismisses the compliance officer’s concerns,
commenting that what Local Partner does with its payments “isn’t our problem.” Sales Executive also strongly objects to the
compliance officer’s request to meet with Principal 1 to discuss the off-shore company and account, assuring him that it was
done for legitimate tax purposes and complaining that if Company A continues to “harass” Local Partner and Distributor, they
would partner with Company A's chief competitor. The compliance officer and the finance officer discuss their concerns with
each other but ultimately sign off on the deal even though their questions had not been answered. Their decision is motivated
in large part by their conversation with Sales Executive, who told them that this was the region's most important contract
and that the detailed FCPA questionnaires and robust anti-corruption representations in the contracts placed the burden on
Distributor and Local Partner to act ethically.

Company A goes forward with the Distributor and Local Partner agreements and wins the contract after six months. The
finance officer approves Company A’s payments to Local Partner via the offshore account, even though Local Partner's invoices
did not contain supporting detail or documentation of any services provided. Company A recorded the payments as legitimate
operational expenses on its books and records. Sales Executive received a large year-end bonus due to the award of the contract.

In fact, Local Partner and Distributor used part of the payments and discount margin, respectively, to funnel bribe payments
to several Ministry of Immigration officials, including Principal 1’s former college roommate, in exchange for awarding the
contract to Company A. Thousands of dollars are also wired to the personal offshore bank account of Sales Executive.

How would DOJ and SEC evaluate the potential FCPA liability of Company A and its employees?

This is not the case of a single “rogue employee” circumventing an otherwise robust compliance program. Although
Company A's finance and compliance officers had the correct instincts to scrutinize the structure and economics of the
transaction and the role of the third parties, their due diligence was incomplete. When the initial inquiry identified significant
red flags, they approved the transaction despite knowing that their concerns were unanswered or the answers they received
raised additional concerns and red flags. Relying on due diligence questionnaires and anti-corruption representations is
insufficient, particularly when the risks are readily apparent. Nor can Company A or its employees shield themselves from
liability because it was Distributor and Local Partner—rather than Company A directly—that made the payments.

The facts suggest that Sales Executive had actual knowledge of or was willfully blind to the consultant's payment of
the bribes. He also personally profited from the scheme (both from the kickback and from the bonus he received from the
company) and intentionally discouraged the finance and compliance officers from learning the full story. Sales Executive is
therefore subject to liability under the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the FCPA, and
others may be as well. Company A may also be liable for violations of the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal
controls provisions of the FCPA given the number and significance of red flags that established a high probability of bribery
and the role of employees and agents acting on the company’s behalf.

Foreword

Ackrell Capital is pleased to present our 2018 Cannabis Investment Report. Much has happened in the
nearly two years since we published our inaugural report: the cannabis industry grew significantly, com-
panies in the industry raised large amounts of capital and their stock prices performed well, and the legal-
ization movement continued worldwide as more countries and U.S. states implemented a framework for
legal cannabis access. There was also a presidential election in the United States; its ultimate impact on
the cannabis industry remains uncertain. What did not happen since we launched our inaugural report?
Federal legalization: “marijuana” continues to be classified as a Schedule I controlled substance under the

Controlled Substances Act in the United States.

In this new edition, we introduce an outlook on global cannabis markets, analyze capital markets for
cannabis companies and present updated market estimates. We also expand on the first edition by providing
more in-depth analyses of the various market segments within—and analyzing the legal issues pertinent
to—the cannabis industry. The Top 100 Private Cannabis Companies list has been updated and our industry
landscape, The Green Field, has been updated and expanded to include more than 500 companies.

Cannabis legalization has accelerated domestically and internationally. In the 2016 U.S. elections, four
states, including California, legalized recreational cannabis (bringing the total number of states with recre-
ational laws to eight) and an additional four states legalized medical cannabis. Cannabis use is now state-

legal in some form in 46 states.

In January 2018, California will implement its recreational law, making it the largest market globally
for the recreational use of cannabis. Similarly, Canada is expected to pass its recreational law in mid-2018.

And in 2017, Germany became the most populous country in the world to pass a medical cannabis law.

Cannabis has mass consumer appeal around the world. (According to the United Nations, more than
180 million people per year use cannabis and it is the most-consumed drug worldwide). While it is clear
that there is significant demand for cannabis, less clear is how quickly illegal markets will transition to
legal markets, as well as the extent to which legalization may increase overall demand.

We continue to believe that it is a question of when—not if—the U.S. federal prohibition on cannabis
will end. We believe that a path toward federal legalization exists and we believe this process has com-
menced. According to Gallup, 64% of Americans today believe that cannabis use should be legal.

Who is the cannabis consumer? It is the 80-year-old cancer patient ingesting cannabis to treat side
effects of chemotherapy. It is the 12-year-old child using cannabis extracts on a doctor's recommendation
to reduce epileptic seizures. It is the 30-something mother or father seeking to relax after a full day. It is
a group of 20-year-olds on a Friday night heading to a concert. It is the millions of people suffering from
anxiety and depression. It is the millions of people treating chronic pain and nausea. It is the millions of
people using cannabis recreationally.

Our team has met with more than 1,000 companies in the cannabis industry. We understand the oppor-

tunities and challenges facing the industry, and we are happy to provide our insights.
Sincerely,

The Ackrell Capital Cannabis Team

First draft:

It is hard to know how to respond to a list of false and/or distorted allegations, along with misleading statements on your part.
Needless to say, | treat people | interact with with respect, and | work hard to support and mentor students, colleagues, and members
of the general public. | do not sexually harass people. If the purpose of your reporting is to somehow argue that that Universities and
other institutions are lax in dealing with well known individuals like myself, then in fact the situation is quite the opposite. My high
public profile opens me up to more scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it also opens me up to a host of outside complaints and
allegations that other faculty do not receive, each of which the University has to respond to. The fact that | have remained a professor
in all Universities with which | have been associated, in good standing, and also an officer or an invited speaker at organizations like
CFI, which have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the fact that they trust my behavior. | was asked to be an honorary
director of CFI, and invited to their last 3 meetings to speak, specifically because, as they have written me after the fact, the attendees
universally appreciated my talks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time with the attendees. If the purpose of your report is
to impugn my integrity or suggest | have a history of harassment, that too is false. As noted in one of your 'miscellaneous facts’, as a
scientist | try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather than allegations and innuendo. | also try and judge the facts
in context. The fact that Universities and other organizations employ me or have me on their boards, or invite me to meetings is
because they value my contributions and my actions.

Your specific allegations are false or distorted. Item 1 refers to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 where we mutually
decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, and had respectful encounters afterwards. |
cannot comment on item 3, which involves an anonymous 3rd party claim, because | know nothing about it, and it was not taken
seriously enough to result in any university action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying that because | decided | didn’t want to go out
to a bar with a group of attendees that | was harassing them? The second part is false. | don’t do that. Re incident 5: The ‘female
companion’ in this case is my wife, who can attest to the fact that the claim is false, which is what | wrote in response to the blog in
question, causing it to be taken down.

It is worthwhile responding to Item 2 and 6 in more detail,

Re item 2: the student in question was interested in science communication, and on dozens of occasions came to me or wrote to me
with questions. When she asked about advice for after graduation | DID tell her she was different than the other students in her

year. The rest of them were interested in going on to graduate school, but she was interested in science communication so | told her
that she might want to take a different path. Since she was the only woman in her year, as | recall, | did ask her on one of these
occasions if that made it difficult for her in any way. | asked, because as a faculty member | was interested, and also because as
someone she had asked for career advice from | wanted to know if that made a difference to her. Re asking her for dinner.. | have
gone back over emails from that period. | have numerous requests from her to go for coffee to talk, which | usually had to turn down
because | was busy, including several occasions where she asked me to have coffee with her off campus to talk, and | politely
declined. | did let her accompany me off campus one time to watch me do a BBC interview because she specifically requested it. |
did and do have coffee and meals with students on campus, and | see nothing wrong with this. | was shocked when | later learned of
her complaint, not least because there was no inappropriate interaction and also because well after the date on which she is said to
have been offended, she continued to email me with joking questions or comments, and at a AAAS conference in 2008, for which she
had asked, and for which | had written her a letter of recommendation to attend, my wife and | gave her a lift well out out of our way to
drop her off at her hotel, and | note in an email response to her email about the conference, agin in 2008, | expressed that | would

fine mess you've gotten us into.’ And your little Stan Laurel gets all

Later, when Groucho started chuckling to himself, | hesitated to

sophisticated in its own way. | like how Jackie Gleason, the character he
plays, accepts the fact that he's not the biological father of his daughter.”

“Oh, really? That sounds like the ultimate ego loss.”

“But I'm really getting a big kick out of playing somebody named

“Typecasting?”

“No, no--it's because--do you realize that irreverence and

2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *920

decision to schedule, reschedule, or continue criminal cases should include victim mput through the victim's assertion of the
right to be free from unreasonable delay. 73°

[*921] The proposed rule also requires that the court state its reason for granting any continuance. This requirement stems
from a recommendation from the President's Task Force on Victims of Crime, which noted the inherent human tendency to
postpone matters, often for insufficient reason, and accordingly recommended that reasons for any granted continuance ... be

clearly stated on the record. 337 Several states have adopted similar provisions. 73%

Rule 51 - Claiming Error Regarding Victims’ Rights

The Proposal:

The procedures for a victim to assert error should be spelled out in the rules as follows:
Rule 51. Preserving Claimed Error

(a) Exceptions Unnecessary. Exceptions to rulings or orders of the court are unnecessary.

(b) Preserving a Claim of Error. A party or a victim may preserve a claim of error by informing the court - when the court
ruling or order is made or sought - of the action the party wishes the court to take, or the party's objection to the court's action
and the grounds for that objection. If a party or a victim does not have an opportunity to object to a ruling or order, the absence
of an objection does not later prejudice that party. A ruling or order that admits or excludes evidence is governed by Federal
Rule of Evidence 103.

The Rationale:

The CVRA authorizes victim appeals and includes procedures for expedited handling of those appeals. 33° The proposed rule
would [*922] incorporate victims into the existing rule regarding preservation of errors.

Rule 53 - Closed-Circuit Transmission of Proceedings for Victims

The Proposal:

Closed-circuit transmission of court proceedings for victims should be authorized as follows:
Rule 53. Courtroom Photographing and Broadcasting Prohibited

(a) General Rule. Except as otherwise provided by a statute or these rules, the court must not permit the taking of photographs
in the courtroom during judicial proceedings or the broadcasting of judicial proceedings from the courtroom.

334 18 U.S.C. 3161-3174.

335 United States v. Turner, 367 F. Supp. 2d 319, 334 n.14 (E.D.N.Y. 2005) (recognizing victim's participatory right with respect to delays
in a criminal case).

336 150 Cong. Rec. $10,911 (daily ed. Oct. 9, 2004) (statement of Sen. Kyl) (emphasis added).
337 President's Task Force on Victims of Crime, Final Report 76 (1982).
338 See, e.g., Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. 13-4435(B) (2001) (courts required to state on the record the reason for [any] continuance); Utah Code

Ann. 77-38-7(3)(b) (2004) (court required to enter in the record the specific reason for the continuance and the procedures that have been
taken to avoid further delays).

339 See 18 U.S.C.A. 3771(d)(3) (West 2004 & Supp. 2005).

Xi Jinping and the New Politburo Standing Committee

Robert Lawrence Kuhn
October 25, 2017

HOST: We're going to put a question to Robert Lawrence
Kuhn, who’s a long-time advisor to the Chinese
government. Robert, great to see you again. You were
with us at the very beginning of the Party Congress and
you were at the Congress today when it finished. Did you
have any vision, any inkling that President Xi Jinping
would take on so much authority? Also, what about the
fact that there is no successor candidates among the new
leaders?

RLK: I was interviewed in early 2012 by a well-known
American television network and the question put to me,
in January of that year, was, “isn’t Xi Jinping going to be a
very weak leader because he was not appointed by Deng
Xiaoping and he has no strong base of support?”

IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018457.txt,"Why had I worried? I knew my parents had striven to give me an independent, rational,
feminist outlook. Self-esteem and integrity. I was so lucky, I understood as my father said
nothing but, All right.” It was a blinding realization: my father might have judged me
with all the worst things I thought of myself -- but instead, he trusted me to do my best.

When I called my mother (long separated from my dad), too many of my flatmates were
around for a private conversation indoors. I banished myself into a warm summer storm,
cradling my cell phone away from the rain. There was a pause after I said the fateful
words -- then she said, Have you talked to your father about this?”

Yes, I said hesitantly. Why?
Well, I think it was an issue in our marriage that I was more into that stuff than he was.

Fat droplets soaked my hair. The tight knot in my chest -- familiar for nearly a year --
loosened as I caught my breath. I turned my face up to the sky and let the tilted world
resettle around me; my mother's faraway voice helped me through a hundred things that
had torn my heart. You aren't giving up your liberation, she reminded me, and
emphasized my continuing right to a partner who respects me. She even noted mildly that
she'd wondered about me when I was a child.

I'd feared that I was damaged, that there was something deeply broken in me. I'd wildly
guessed that I'd suffered trauma and repressed the memories. But if my mother -- one of
the most independent, feminist women I've ever met -- could reconcile BDSM, then I
knew I could. And if she was into BDSM herself, then rather than viewing my
proclivities as damage, I could see them as something intrinsic we shared.

Over the next hour, my mother told me I could retain rationality, self-esteem and
integrity. For the first time, I found myself believing it.

My therapist laughed when I told him. I swear, he cried, it's genetic!

te Kk ok

There was one loose end to a conclusion that felt like a fairy tale. Though we had some
unfettered conversations, tension remained between me and Richard -- perhaps it even
worsened. At one point, observing us, Andrew said mildly: Settle down, you two.

Worse, Andrew and I were going in different directions. I finally felt somewhat at peace
with BDSM, but he couldn't gain that comfort, and started backing away from it. It was
impossible not to think of Richard and shiver, remembering how uncompromisingly
vicious he could be. When Andrew and I broke up over a year later, I knew: J shouldn't
see Richard. My therapist warned me to be careful with BDSM when my heart was in
pieces.

Of course I wasn't.

It was the first time I'd explicitly pursued Richard since he'd told me, so long ago, that he
was busy. I emailed him straightforwardly, sat down on his bed shortly after Andrew and
I broke up. When Richard set his fingernails into my skin, he murmured, It's been a
while,” as if he'd always known he'd see me here again. The tears came more quickly
than they once had -- I'd fought them then, unwilling to break down in front of him. I'd

Hi Jeffrey, 
Attached please find the Sept 2 position. The realized gain 
increased by the $28 k option premium that resulted from the

GBP and the NZD today. The USD rallied against the CAD and the 
JPY. 
I have separated y t d p/lfrom Sept p/1 so that the numbers mean

greater detail about how, for both our countries’ benefit, that could be avoided.
When we convened in Secretary Cheney’s office, I delivered the same message,
but more forcefully. I felt it was essential not only to make it clear we serious
about taking action, but that we had the military capability to do so. So I told
Secretary Cheney and Colin what we were planning. I said we intended to
launch a combined air and ground assault by an air-mobile force and our best
paratroop units. At that point, Colin, who was clearly worried, suggested the
two of us withdraw to speak “soldier to soldier.” We retreated to his office.
Spreading out a map of western Iraq, I went into greater detail, explaining how
we would remain in the Iraqi desert on a search-and-destroy mission against the
mobile launchers. Colin stressed the efforts the Americans were making from
the air, and the commitment they’d shown to Israel. Not only had they delivered
the Patriots. They had allocated their best fighter jets, F-15E’s, to the task of
taking out the Scuds. It helped that he and I had got to know and respect each
other, so it wasn’t an all-out argument. But I reiterated that if the Scud attacks
kept up, we would have to act. “We will act,” I said. For a few seconds, he said
nothing. But as we headed back to join the others, he told me that only a few
hours ago, he had briefed American commanders on an anti-Scud operation by
“allied forces” like the one we were planning. “It will happen,” he assured me.
“Within 48 hours.”

That task fell to Britain’s SAS. The operation was almost exactly the same as
the one we’d planned. A force of nearly 700 commandos was helicoptered in to
Iraq’s western desert, equipped with Jeeps and Land Rovers, and anti-tank
missiles and laser targeting capability. They were also able to call on attack
helicopters and F-15 jets if necessary. The operation did not prove easy, quick,
or entirely successful. The British troops blocked the main roads and patrolled
them. But they did not find or destroy a single mobile launcher. They ended up
in gun battles with Iraqi troops. The SAS lost something like two dozen men.
Five were part of a group that got separated from the others and ended up
freezing to death in the February cold. All of the men risked their lives, with
incredible determination and bravery, in an operation to secure the safety of
Israel’s civilian population. And I have no doubt that the outcome, like the plan,
would have been almost identical if we had done it ourselves.

And it did have an effect. As I’d told Prime Minister Shamir when briefing
him on our attack plan, the very fact of a military presence on the ground made
a dramatic difference. The number, accuracy and impact of the Scuds dropped
off steeply. A few missiles kept coming, however. Since we did not yet have a

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026480.txt,"It was initiated in defiance of a longstanding Justice Department presumption against investigating
campaigns in an election year. And while impartiality 1s always required, a 2012 memo by then-
Attorney General Eric Holder emphasizes that impartiality 1s “particularly important in an election
year,” and “politics must play no role in the decisions of federal prosecutors or investigators regarding
any investigations. ... Law enforcement officers and prosecutors may never select the timing of
investigative steps or criminal charges for the purpose of affecting any election, or for the purpose of

giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party.”

Strong evidence of a crime can overcome this policy, as was the case with the bureau’s investigation
of Mrs. Clinton’s private email server, which began more than a year before the 2016 election. But
Crossfire was not a criminal investigation. It was a counterintelligence investigation predicated on the
notion that Russia could be colluding with the Trump campaign. There appears to have been no
discernible evidence of Trump-Russia collusion at the time Crossfire was launched, further reinforcing

the notion that it was initiated “for the purpose” of affecting the presidential election.

The chief evidence of collusion is the hacking of the Democratic National Committee’s servers. But
nothing in the public record suggests the Trump campaign aided that effort. The collusion narrative
therefore hinges on the more generic assertion that Russia aimed to help Mr. Trump’s election, and
that the Trump campaign reciprocated by embracing pro-Russian policies. Yet despite massive
surveillance and investigation, there’s still no public evidence of any such exchange—only that Russia

attempted to sow political discord by undermining Mrs. Clinton and to a lesser extent Mr. Trump.

Some members of the Trump team interacted with Russians and advocated dovish policies. But so did
numerous American political and academic elites, including many Clinton advisers. Presidential
campaigns routinely seek opposition research and interact with foreign powers. The Clinton campaign
funded the Steele dossier, whose British author paid Russians to dish anti-Trump dirt. The Podesta
Group, led by the brother of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, received millions lobbying for
Russia’s largest bank and the European Center for a Modern Ukraine, both with deep Kremlin ties.

The Clinton Foundation and Bill Clinton took millions from Kremlin-connected businesses.

No evidence has emerged of Trump-Russia collusion, and Mr. Mueller has yet to bring collusion-
related charges against anyone. Evidence suggests one of his targets, George Papadopoulos, was lured
to London, plied with the prospect of Russian information damaging to Mrs. Clinton, and taken to
dinner, where he drunkenly bragged that he’d heard about such dirt but never seen it. These
circumstances not only fail to suggest Mr. Papadopoulos committed a crime, they reek of entrapment.

The source of this information, former Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, admits Mr.

of the guilty plea and sentence no later than October 26, 2007; and (5) the start of the above-
mentioned sentence no later than January 4, 2008.

Furthermore, and significantly, Epstein agreed that he had the burden of ensuring compliance
of the Agreement with the Palm Beach County State Attorney’s Office and the Judge of the 15
Judicial Circuit and “that the failure to do so will be a breach of the agreement” (emphasis added).

Post-Execution of the Agreement

Within weeks of the execution of the Agreement, you sought to delay the entry of Epstein’s
guilty plea and sentence. After the SDFL agreed to accommodate your requést, counse/ for Epstein
began taking issue with the methodology of compensation, notification to the victims, and the issues

that had been previously considered and rejected during negotiations, i.e., that the conduct does not

require registration and the contemplated state and federal statutes have no applicability to the instant
matter. ,

A. Delay.

The Agreement required that “Epstein shall use his best efforts to enter his guilty plea and
be sentenced not later than October 26, 2007. The United States has no objection to Epstein self-
reporting to begin serving his sentence not later than January 4, 2008.” Agreement, pages 4-5,
paragraph | 1 (emphasis added). After the Agreement was executed, the SDFL accommodated your
request to extend the October 26th plea deadline to November 20 based upon, what seemed to be,
reasonable scheduling conflict issues.' By early November, you represented that the presiding state
court judge would not “stagger the plea and sentencing as contemplated in the Agreement.” Although
the Agreement clearly did not contemplate a staggered “plea and sentencing,” the SDFL again agreed
to accommodate Epstein’s request to appear in state court for plea and sentencing on January 4,
2008.”

t “Accordingly, I have now confirmed with Mr. Epstein's Florida counsel that the state's
attorney's office and the court will be available to have him enter his plea on November 20. So we will
plan to proceed on one that date.” October 18, 2007 email from Jay Lefkowitz to USA R. Alexander
Acosta. °

On the same day, Mr. Lefkowitz confirmed with First Assistant Jeffrey H. Sloman that this
postponement “ will not affect when Epstein begins serving his sentence.”

Correspondence from Jay Lefkowitz to FAUSA Sloman dated November 8, 2007 (“the judge
has invited the parties to appear for the plea and sentencing on January 4, we do not anticipate any delay
beyond that date.”)

IMAGES-009-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027946.txt,"Chapter Seven

If you’d visited Tel Aviv in July 1967, you would have sensed a new spirit
of confidence, not cockiness exactly, but a sort of spring in the collective step.
This was not just due to the Six-Day War. It was because the city, if not yet the
rest of the country, had shed the economic austerity of Israel’s first two decades
and was beginning to experience at least some of the consumer comforts which
Western Europe, or America, took for granted. But we were still a decade away
from the first shopping malls, or the upscale cafés and restaurants which
nowadays give places like Dizengoff Street, a few blocks back from the
seafront, the feel of London or Paris on a summer’s day. Television had been
introduced only a year before the war. Color TV was still nearly a decade away.
I can’t say I was surprised to learn, when the archives were opened a few years
ago, that a committee of moral arbiters in our Ministry of Education vetoed
plans for the Beatles to perform in the city. “No intrinsic artistic value,” they
pronounced. “And their concerts provoke mass hysteria.”

Even in Tel Aviv, and certainly the rest of Israel, a kind of cultural austerity
still prevailed, an emphasis on modesty and self-restraint. It was a legacy of
1948, a reflection of the years of shared sacrifice, physical labor, and the life-
and-death struggles which I, like most Israelis at the time, had experienced
within our own lifetimes. That may help explain why I can remember no one
remarking on an aspect of my character which, once I rose to public
prominence, would attract attention, frequent comment, and sometimes
criticism as well: the fact that I seemed so se/f-contained, reluctant to engage
emotionally with people beyond a circle of close friends or confidants. My lack
of smalltalk, and the kind of gladhanding and schmoozing that are the currency
of political life. At the time of the 1967 war, I was not yet a public figure. Yet to
the extent those around me would have taken note — family, university
classmates, sayeret comrades, or officers in the Airya — my slight emotional
aloofness, my focus on simply getting things done, and the way I internalized
setbacks, even tragedies like the death of Nechemia Cohen, was not exceptional.
It was, in many ways, simply Israeli.

Yet as Israel, Israeli society and my place in them changed, it would be
suggested to me more than once — not always kindly, when it was from critics or
rivals — that I had a “touch of Aspbergers” in me, a reference to those on the
more benign reaches of the autism spectrum with a special facility for math,

are no real victims here.” Jd. Ex. C.

In January 2011, the judge presiding over the sex-offender registration proceedings,
Justice Ruth Pickholz, rejected ADA Gaffney’s arguments and designated Epstein as a level
three sex offender. Epstein, 89 A.D.3d at 570, 933 N.Y.S.2d at 240. Ata hearing preceding her
ruling, Justice Pickholz told the Assistant District Attorney that she had “never seen the
prosecutor’s office do anything like this” and further stated that she had “done many [cases]
much less troubling than this one where [prosecutors] would never make a downward argument
like this.” Jd. Ex. B. When ADA Gaffney was questioned about whether she knew Epstein had
sexually abused other minors, Gaffney admitted that she had never spoken to the federal
investigators in Florida who had reached the conclusion that Epstein was a serial abuser of
underage girls. Id. Ex. C.

B. The Appeal

Epstein subsequently commenced this Appeal, seeking to overturn the trial court’s ruling
that he is a level three sex offender. The appellate briefs submitted by Epstein and the
Manhattan District Attorney were filed under seal, pursuant to New York Civil Rights Law
section 50-b. /d. 47. That statute protects the anonymity “of any victim of a sex offense” by
requiring any “court file . .. which tends to identify such a victim” to be filed under seal. N.Y.
Civ. Rights Law § 50-b(1). The statute further provides, however, that court documents filed
under seal shall be disclosed if a movant “demonstrates to the satisfaction of the court that good
cause exists for disclosure to that person.” /d. § 50-b(2)(b).

In a decision filed on the public docket (the “Decision’’), this Court affirmed Epstein’s
level three offender status because the lower “court properly relied on highly reliable proof of
criminal conduct for which defendant was neither indicted nor convicted.” Epstein, 89 A.D.3d at

(a) He did have sex with Ms. Ransome.

(b) He was Ms. Ransome’s lawyer.

(c) Ms. Ransome’s statements about her involvement with Dershowitz
preceded any contact with Roberts’ attorneys. For example, Ransome’s first
contact with any of Roberts’ lawyers was in November 2016, and at least as early
as October 2016 Ransome had identified Dershowitz in writing to a reporter as
someone who had had sex with one or more of the girls provided by Epstein and
that Epstein had arranged for Dershowitz to be Ransome’s lawyer.

82. After settling the case against him brought by Messrs. Edwards and Cassell,
Dershowitz told the media he had been vindicated, while at the same time insisting that the term
of the settlement remains confidential. Edwards and Cassell responded: “Following the
announcement of the settlement of defamation claims against Alan Dershowitz, he has been
making public statements suggesting that he has prevailed in the lawsuit and that the terms of the
settlement exonerate him of any wrongdoing. Those statements are at best misleading. It is a
mistake for anyone to conclude based upon Mr. Dershowitz’s statements that the case against
him was abandoned due to lack of factual support. It is a mistake for anyone to conclude based
upon Dershowitz’s statements that Bradley Edwards and Paul Cassell had determined that the
allegations against Alan Dershowitz made by Virginia Roberts Giuffre were false or unfounded.
Neither the terms of settlement nor the agreed upon joint public statement issued as part of the
settlement support any such conclusion and it is false to state or suggest otherwise.” Dershowitz

Overview

The Las Vegas Strip has historically outperformed competitive U.S. retail markets and continues to experience very strong absorption of
new construction, low vacancy rates, and an abundance of retail tenants seeking to access high-traffic pedestrian locations. These factors
together with controlled levels of new development will cause significant long-term rent increases across the submarket.

Increasing Levels of Visitor Spending — More than half of the 41 million visitors to Las Vegas each year spend time shopping along the Las
Vegas Strip. Average per capita visitor spending on shopping, dining and entertainment during 2014 was $815. As demonstrated in the
exhibit below, consumers are allocating a larger percentage of their total spending on shopping and entertainment.

The win per unit per day (WPUPD) statistic provides the basis for the analysis and projection of table game and gaming device revenues.
WPUPD is calculated by dividing total gaming revenues generated by a particular type of gaming unit by the number of gaming units
available. Overall, the market for gaming devices exhibited high levels of demand and absorption as evidenced by increasing WPUPD and
overall win levels during periods of increasing inventory.

The following exhibit summarizes the strong performance of the Strip gaming market within the industry standard “Casinos earning $72M

CHAPTER SEVEN

Crossing the Rubicon

“What I came to feel is that a regime that is described as a national security agency has stopped representing the
public interest and has instead begun to protect and promote state security interests. “

--Edward Snowden, interviewed in Moscow 2014

Soon after Snowden failed to get a SES job at the NSA, he intensified his rogue activities. At
that time, Dell was tasked with building an enhanced backup system for the NSA in Hawaii. Deputy
Director Ledgett explained that part of Snowden’s job as a system administrator under contract to Dell was
transferring files held at Fort Meade to back-up computers in Hawaii. He “was moving copies of that
data there for them, which was perfect cover for stealing the [NSA] data.” Snowden took
advantage of this cover.

Snowden expanded his own rogue operation, as Ledgett reconstructed the breach, through the
fall and winter of 2012. There was little risk of him getting caught. The security measures at the
Hawaii base presented no obstacles to him since, as a system administrator, he had privileges that
allowed him to copy documents that had not been encrypted. Indeed, it was part of the process
of building the backup system. The flaw he had pointed to in Japan in which system
administrators working solo could safely steal files also existed in Hawaii. This time, however,
instead of bringing it to the attention of the NSA, he used it to himself steal files. He could be
confident that his 2012 thefts of documents would go undetected because the NSA’s base had not
yet installed an auditing system. Such real-time auditing of the movement of documents, which
was done at NSA headquarters in Fort Meade and most of the NSA’s regional facilities, had not
yet been installed at the Hawaii base because a lack of bandwidth prevented the safe upgrading of
the software. This auditing software was scheduled to be installed after the backup system was
completed in 2013. The Kunia base was one of the last NSA bases which did not monitor
suspicious transfers of files on a real-time basis. Snowden certainly was certainly aware of this
deficiency. He later pointed out in his interview in Wired magazine in Moscow that the NSA base
where he worked did not have an “audit” mechanism. This security gap allowed Snowden, using
his system administrator’s credentials, to copy classified data to a thumb drive without anyone
being able to trace the copied data back to him. And, according to the NSA’s subsequent damage
assessment, he stole many thousands of pages while working for Dell in 2012 before he contacted
journalists. Deputy Director Ledgett subsequently reported that the NSA analysis the 58,000
documents that were given by Snowden to journalists in June 2013 showed that most of them
were taken by Snowden while he was still working at Dell.

VIA FACSIMILE CONFIDENTIAL 
Honorable Mark Filip 
Office of the Deputy Attorney General 
United States Department of Justice 
950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. 
Washington, D.C. 20530 
Dear Judge Filip: 
This letter briefly supplements our prior submission to you dated May 19, 2008. In that 
communication, we urgently requested that your Office conduct an independent review of the 
proposed federal prosecution of our client, Jeffrey Epstein. The dual reasons for our request that 
you review this matter are (i) the bedrock need for integrity in the enforcement of federal 
criminal laws, and (ii) the profound questions raised by the unprecedented extension of federal 
law by the United States Attorney's Office in Miami (the USAO) to a prominent public figure 
who has close ties to former President Clinton. 
The need for review is now all the more exigent. On Monday, May 19, 2008, First 
Assistant Jeffrey Sloman of the USAO responded to an email from Jay Lefkowitz informing U.S. 
Attorney Alex Acosta that we would be seeking your Office's review. Mr. Sloman's letter, 
which imposed a deadline of June 2, 2008 to comply with all the terms of the current Non-
Prosecution Agreement (the Agreement), plus new unilateral modifications, on pain of being 
deemed in breach of that Agreement, appears to have been deliberately designed to deprive us of 
an adequate opportunity to seek your Office's review in this matter. 
The USAO's desire to foreclose a complete review is understandable, given that the 
Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) has already determined that our substantive 
arguments regarding why a federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein is not warranted were 
compelling. However, in contradiction to Mr. Sloman's assertion that CEOS had provided an 
independent, de novo review, CEOS made clear that it did not do so. Indeed, CEOS declined to 
examine several of the more troubling aspects of the investigation of Mr. Epstein, including the 
deliberate leak to the New York Times of numerous highly confidential aspects of the 
investigation and negotiations between the parties as well as the recent crop of civil lawsuits 
filed against Mr. Epstein by Mr. Sloman's former law partner. 
The unnecessary and arbitrarily imposed deadline set by the USAO was done without any 
respect for the normal functioning and scheduling of state judicial matters. It requires that 
Mr. Epstein's counsel persuade the State Attorney of Palm Beach to issue a criminal information 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 010732 
Honorable Mark Filip 
May 27, 2008 
Page 2 
to a charge that the State Attorney has not, despite a two year investigation, determined to be 
appropriate. Mr. Epstein's counsel must also successfully expedite a plea of guilty to this charge 
on a date prior to July 8, 2008, which is the date presently set by the state court Judge. 
Further, the unnecessary deadline is even more problematic because Mr. Epstein's effort 
to reconcile the state charge and sentence with the terms of the Agreement requires an unusual 
and unprecedented threatened application of federal law. Thus, it places Mr. Epstein in the 
highly unusual position of having to demand that the State acquiesce to a more severe 
punishment than it had already determined was appropriate. 
We have attempted to resolve these and other issues through the USA() and CEOS, 
including raising our concerns about the USAO's inappropriate conduct with respect to this 
matter. But those avenues have now been shut down. Mr. Sloman's letter purports to prohibit 
any further contact between Mr. Epstein's defense team and U.S. Attorney Acosta, and instead 
requires us to communicate with the USA() only though Mr. Sloman's subordinates. 
While it pains us to say this, this misguided prosecution from the outset gives the 
appearance that it may have been politically motivated. Mr. Epstein is a highly successful, self-
made businessman and philanthropist who entered the public arena only by virtue of his close 
personal association with former President Bill Clinton. There is little doubt in our minds that 
the USA() never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case if Mr. Epstein were just 
another John. 
U.S. Attorney Acosta previously has stated that he is sympathetic to our federalism-
related concerns, but he has taken the position that his authority is limited by enforcement 
policies set forth in Washington, D.C. As expressed in our prior communication to you, we 
believe that a complete and independent appraisal and resolution of this case most appropriately 
would be undertaken by your Office—beginning with the rescission of the arbitrary, unfair, and 
unprecedented deadline that Mr. Sloman demands to have imposed in this case. At the very 
least, we would appreciate a tolling of the arbitrary timeline imposed on our client by the USA() 
in order to allow time for your office to consider our request that you undertake a review of this 
case. 
Thank you for your time and attention.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030463.txt,"When I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that “Andy’”—as
Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his strange title is. Because if one
thing’s for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what he’s talking about far more than “Andy” does.
Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other financiers hang out with him.

And Ghislaine?
Full disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It’s almost impossible not to.

She is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I’ve spent hours talking to her about
the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is curious. She has spent weeks at the bottom
of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent me a DVD of the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away
almost anyone else’s I can think of—probably even Rupert Murdochs’. She is very well-read and can talk about most things for
hours. She is passionate about Bill Clinton with whom she is close friends.

Yet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party ofher best friend, Ariadne Calvo-Platero, (known
fondly to her close friends as “the Tennis Goddess”) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When it comes down to things she
really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her vulnerability.

And that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey.

“He saved her,” I remember a close friend of mine telling me. “When her father died, she was a wreck; inconsolable. And then
Jeffrey took her in. She’s never forgotten that—and never will.”

In many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect replacement for her
father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his sexual pecadillos, but then Ghislaine’s
father was not without his oddities. After all, it was he who died leaving a massive “black hole” he’d fraudulently created. To
Ghislaine, Jeffrey’s habits may not have seemed that strange.

In fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful people in the end
either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl issues, and moved countries to avoid
paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You don’t tend to get to the top by being the world’s most
balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett didn’t quite manage a normal life—whatever that is. He had a second
“wife” for many years whose existence he has been open about.

So what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven’t spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her loyalty to friends
like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she’|] be out and about as always. Look at Waksal and Stewart. No one
sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up for all sorts of blemishes.

It makes no difference how honorable he is. His investigation is tainted by the bias that 
attended its origin in 2016.

David B. Rivkin Jr. and 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026280 
Elizabeth Price Foley

414  COMMENTS 
Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation may face a serious legal obstacle: It is tainted by 
antecedent political bias. The June 14 report from Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department's 
inspector general, unearthed a pattern of anti-Trump bias by high-ranking officials at the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation. Some of their communications, the report says, were not only indicative of a 
biased state of mind but imply a willingness to take action to impact a presidential candidate's electoral 
prospects. Although Mr. Horowitz could not definitively ascertain whether this bias directly 
affected specific FBI actions in the Hillary Clinton email investigation, it nonetheless affects the 
legality of the Trump-Russia collusion inquiry, code-named Crossfire Hurricane. 
Crossfire was launched only months before the 2016 election. Its FBI progenitors—the same ones who 
had investigated Mrs. Clinton—deployed at least one informant to probe Trump campaign advisers, 
obtained Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court wiretap warrants, issued national security letters to 
gather records, and unmasked the identities of campaign officials who were surveilled. They also 
repeatedly leaked investigative information. 
Mr. Horowitz is separately scrutinizing Crossfire and isn't expected to finish for months. But the 
current report reveals that FBI officials displayed not merely an appearance of bias against Donald 
Trump, but animus bordering on hatred. Peter Strzok, who led both the Clinton and Trump 
investigations, confidently assuaged a colleague's fear that Mr. Trump would become president: No 
he won't. We'll stop it. An unnamed FBI lawyer assigned to Crossfire told a colleague he was 
devastated and numb after Mr. Trump won, while declaring to another FBI attorney: Viva le 
resistance. 
The report highlights the FBI's failure to act promptly upon discovering that Anthony Weiner's laptop 
contained thousands of Mrs. Clinton's emails. Investigators justified the delay by citing the higher 
priority of Crossfire. But Mr. Horowitz writes: We did not have confidence that Strzok's decision to 
prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on [the] investigative lead discovered on the 
Weiner laptop was free from bias. 
Similarly, although Mr. Horowitz found no evidence that then-FBI Director James Comey was trying 
to influence the election, Mr. Comey did make decisions based on political considerations. He told the 
inspector general that his election-eve decision to reopen the Clinton email investigation was motivated 
by a desire to protect her assumed presidency's legitimacy. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026281 
The inspector general wrote that Mr. Strzok's text messages created the appearance that investigative 
decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations. The report adds, importantly, that most 
of the text messages raising such questions pertained to the Russia investigation. Given how biases 
ineluctably shape behavior, these facts create a strong inference that by squelching the Clinton 
investigation and building a narrative of Trump-Russia collusion, a group of government officials 
sought to bolster Mrs. Clinton's electoral chances and, if the unthinkable happened, obtain an insurance 
policy to cripple the Trump administration with accusations of illegitimacy. 
What does this have to do with Mr. Mueller, who was appointed in May 2017 after President Trump 
fired Mr. Comey? The inspector general concludes that the pervasive bias cast a cloud over the FBI 
investigations to which these employees were assigned, including Crossfire. And if Crossfire was 
politically motivated, then its culmination, the appointment of a special counsel, inherited the taint. All 
special-counsel activities—investigations, plea deals, subpoenas, reports, indictments and 
convictions—are fruit of a poisonous tree, byproducts of a violation of due process. That Mr. Mueller 
and his staff had nothing to do with Crossfire's origin offers no cure. 
When the government deprives a person of life, liberty or property, it is required to use fundamentally 
fair processes. The Supreme Court has made clear that when governmental action shocks the 
conscience, it violates due process. Such conduct includes investigative or prosecutorial efforts that 
appear, under the totality of the circumstances, to be motivated by corruption, bias or entrapment. 
In U.S. v. Russell (1973), the justices observed: We may someday be presented with a situation in 
which the conduct of law enforcement agents is so outrageous that due process principles would 
absolutely bar the government from invoking judicial processes to obtain a conviction. It didn't take 
long. In Blackledge v. Perry (1974), the court concluded that due process was offended by a 
prosecutor's realistic likelihood of 'vindictiveness'  that tainted the very initiation of proceedings. 
In Young v. U.S. ex rel. Vuitton (1987), the justices held that because prosecutors have power to 
employ the full machinery of the state in scrutinizing any given individual. . . we must have assurance 
that those who would wield this power will be guided solely by their sense of public responsibility for 
the attainment of justice. Prosecutors must be disinterested and make dispassionate assessments, 
free from any personal bias. 
In Williams v. Pennsylvania (2016), the court held that a state judge's potential bias violated due 
process because he had played a role, a quarter-century earlier, in prosecuting the death-row inmate 
whose habeas corpus petition he was hearing. The passage of time and involvement of others do not 
vitiate the taint but heighten the need for objective rules preventing the operation of bias that might 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026282 
otherwise be obscured, the justices wrote. A single biased individual might still have an influence 
that, while not so visible . . . is nevertheless significant. 
In addition to the numerous anti-Trump messages uncovered by the inspector general, there is a strong 
circumstantial case—including personnel, timing, methods and the absence of evidence—that Crossfire 
was initiated for political, not national-security, purposes. 
It was initiated in defiance of a longstanding Justice Department presumption against investigating 
campaigns in an election year. And while impartiality is always required, a 2012 memo by then-
Attorney General Eric Holder emphasizes that impartiality is particularly important in an election 
year, and politics must play no role in the decisions of federal prosecutors or investigators regarding 
any investigations. . . . Law enforcement officers and prosecutors may never select the timing of 
investigative steps or criminal charges for the purpose of affecting any election, or for the purpose of 
giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party. 
Strong evidence of a crime can overcome this policy, as was the case with the bureau's investigation of 
Mrs. Clinton's private email server, which began more than a year before the 2016 election. But 
Crossfire was not a criminal investigation. It was a counterintelligence investigation predicated on the 
notion that Russia could be colluding with the Trump campaign. There appears to have been no 
discernible evidence of Trump-Russia collusion at the time Crossfire was launched, further reinforcing 
the notion that it was initiated for the purpose of affecting the presidential election. 
The chief evidence of collusion is the hacking of the Democratic National Committee's servers. But 
nothing in the public record suggests the Trump campaign aided that effort. The collusion narrative 
therefore hinges on the more generic assertion that Russia aimed to help Mr. Trump's election, and that 
the Trump campaign reciprocated by embracing pro-Russian policies. Yet despite massive surveillance 
and investigation, there's still no public evidence of any such exchange—only that Russia attempted to 
sow political discord by undermining Mrs. Clinton and to a lesser extent Mr. Trump. 
Some members of the Trump team interacted with Russians and advocated dovish policies. But so did 
numerous American political and academic elites, including many Clinton advisers. Presidential 
campaigns routinely seek opposition research and interact with foreign powers. The Clinton campaign 
funded the Steele dossier, whose British author paid Russians to dish anti-Trump dirt. The Podesta 
Group, led by the brother of Mrs. Clinton's campaign chairman, received millions lobbying for 
Russia's largest bank and the European Center for a Modern Ukraine, both with deep Kremlin ties. The 
Clinton Foundation and Bill Clinton took millions from Kremlin-connected businesses. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026283 
No evidence has emerged of Trump-Russia collusion, and Mr. Mueller has yet to bring collusion-
related charges against anyone. Evidence suggests one of his targets, George Papadopoulos, was lured 
to London, plied with the prospect of Russian information damaging to Mrs. Clinton, and taken to 
dinner, where he drunkenly bragged that he'd heard about such dirt but never seen it. These 
circumstances not only fail to suggest Mr. Papadopoulos committed a crime, they reek of entrapment. 
The source of this information, former Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, admits Mr. 
Papadopolous never mentioned emails, destroying any reasonable inference of a connection between 
the DNC hack and the Trump campaign. 
Crossfire's progenitors thus ignored an obvious question: If Russia promised unspecified dirt on Mrs. 
Clinton but never delivered it, how would that amount to collusion with the Trump campaign? If 
anything, such behavior suggests an attempt to entice and potentially embarrass Mr. Trump by 
dangling the prospect of compromising information and getting his aides to jump at it. 
Given the paucity of evidence, it's staggering that the FBI would initiate a counterintelligence 
investigation, led by politically biased staff, amid a presidential campaign. The aggressive methods and 
subsequent leaking only strengthen that conclusion. If the FBI sincerely believed Trump associates 
were Russian targets or agents, the proper response would have been to inform Mr. Trump so that he 
could protect his campaign and the country. 
Mr. Trump's critics argue that the claim of political bias is belied by the fact that Crossfire was not 
leaked before the election. In fact, there were vigorous, successful pre-election efforts to publicize the 
Trump-Russia collusion narrative. Shortly after Crossfire's launch, CIA Director John Brennan and Mr. 
Comey briefed Congress, triggering predictable leaking. Christopher Steele and his patrons embarked 
on a media roadshow, making their dossier something of an open secret in Washington. 
On Aug. 29, 2016, the New York Times published a letter to Mr. Comey from Senate Minority Leader 
Harry Reid, saying he'd learned of evidence of a direct connection between the Russian government 
and Donald Trump's presidential campaign, which had employed a number of individuals with 
significant and disturbing ties to Russia and the Kremlin. On Aug. 30, the ranking Democratic 
members of four House committees wrote a public letter to Mr. Comey requesting that the FBI assess 
whether connections between Trump campaign officials and Russian interests may have contributed 
to the DNC hack so as to interfere with the U.S. presidential election. On Sept. 23, Yahoo News's 
Michael Isikoff reported the Hill briefings and the Steele dossier's allegations regarding Carter Page. 
On Oct. 30, Harry Reid again publicly wrote Mr. Comey: In my communications with you and other 
top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026284 
information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian 
government. 
That these leaking efforts failed to prevent Mr. Trump's victory, or that Mr. Comey's ham-fisted 
interventions might have also hurt Mrs. Clinton's electoral prospects, does not diminish the legal 
significance of the anti-Trump bias shown by government officials. 
The totality of the circumstances creates the appearance that Crossfire was politically motivated. Since 
an attempt by federal law enforcement to influence a presidential election shocks the conscience, any 
prosecutorial effort derived from such an outrageous abuse of power must be suppressed. The public 
will learn more once the inspector general finishes his investigation into Crossfire's genesis. But given 
what is now known, due process demands, at a minimum, that the special counsel's activity be paused. 
Those affected by Mr. Mueller's investigation could litigate such an argument in court. One would 
hope, however, that given the facts either Mr. Mueller himself or Deputy Attorney General Rod 
Rosenstein would do it first.

Justice Department and the White House Counsel's Office during the Reagan and George H.W. Bush

proved ineffective in hiding him from U.S. intelligence and presum-
ably other intelligence services seeking the treasure trove of docu-
ments he had taken from the NSA.

As for his next destination, I could find no evidence that Snowden
had made any arrangements during his monthlong stay in Hong
Kong to go to any Latin American country. Before he went public
on June 9, he could have easily gotten a visa in Hong Kong with his
still-valid passport to go to almost any country in the world, includ-
ing Cuba (for which a U.S. passport was not necessary), Bolivia, and
Ecuador. Yet he did not apply for visas during this time period. Even
as late as June 8, after meetings with Greenwald and Poitras, his
name had still not been revealed, no criminal complaint had been
issued against him, and there was no Interpol red alert for his deten-
tion. He could have walked out of the Mira hotel, caught a taxi to
the Hong Kong airport, and gone on Swiss International Air Lines
via Zurich to any country in South America or to Iceland. But, as
in the oft-cited Sherlock Holmes clue of the dog that did not bark,
Snowden’s inaction in not obtaining visas during this thirty-day

® period suggests that he had no plans to go anyplace but where he ©
went: Moscow.

However, the mystery that most concerned me was not where
Snowden was housed in the interim between when he went pub-
lic and when he went to Moscow. It was where, and in whose care,
Snowden had been before he checked into the Mira on June 1. When
I asked my source about this period, he said that as far as he knew,
neither the FBI nor the Hong Kong police could find a trace of him
during the period between May 20, when he passed through Hong
Kong customs, and June 1, when he first used his credit card and
passport to check into the Mira hotel. Other than those transac-
tions, they could not find any credit card charges, ATM withdrawals,
telephone calls, hotel registrations, subway pass purchases, or other
clues to Snowden’s activities. As far as a paper trail was concerned,
Snowden was a ghost during this period.

“Could an American just vanish in Hong Kong for eleven days?”
Lasked.

“Apparently, he did just that,” my source replied.

Snowden’s whereabouts during these eleven days was not a mys-

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031334.txt,"In an astounding move puzzling many in Moscow, Putin after reading this secret FSB report today ordered
posted to the Kremlin’s official website a defense of Strauss-Khan becoming the first world leader to state that
the former IMF chief was a victim of a US conspiracy. Putin further stated, “It’s hard for me to evaluate the
hidden political motives but | cannot believe that it looks the way it was initially introduced. It doesn’t sit right
in my head.”

Interesting to note about all of these events is that one of the United States top Congressman, and 2012
Presidential candidate, Ron Paul has long stated his belief that the US government has lied about its gold
reserves held at Fort Knox. So concerned had Congressman Paul become about the US government and the
Federal Reserve hiding the truth about American gold reserves he put forward a bill in late 2010 to force an
audit of them, but which was subsequently defeated by Obama regime forces.

When directly asked by reporters if he believed there was no gold in Fort Knox or the Federal Reserve,
Congressman Paul gave the incredible reply, “I think it is a possibility.”

Also interesting to note is that barely 3 days after the arrest of Strauss-Kahn, Congressman Paul made a new
call for the US to sell its gold reserves by stating, “Given the high price it is now, and the tremendous debt
problem we now have, by all means, sell at the peak.”

Bizarre reports emanating from the US for years, however, suggest there is no gold to sell, and as we can read
as posted in 2009 on the ViewZone.Com news site:

“In October of 2009 the Chinese received a shipment of gold bars. Gold is regularly exchanged between
countries to pay debts and to settle the so-called balance of trade.

Most gold is exchanged and stored in vaults under the supervision of a special organization based in London,
the London Bullion Market Association (or LBMA). When the shipment was received, the Chinese government
asked that special tests be performed to guarantee the purity and weight of the gold bars. In this test, four
small holes are drilled into the gold bars and the metal is then analyzed.

Officials were shocked to learn that the bars were fake. They contained cores of tungsten with only a outer
coating of real gold. What’s more, these gold bars, containing serial numbers for tracking, originated in the US
and had been stored in Fort Knox for years. There were reportedly between 5,600 to 5,700 bars, weighing 400
oz. each, in the shipment!”

To the final fate of Strauss-Kahn it is not in our knowing, but new reports coming from the United States show
his determination not to go down without a fight as he has hired what is described as a ‘crack team’ of former
CIA spies, private investigators and media advisers to defend him.

To the practical effects on the global economy should it be proved that the US, indeed, has been lying about
its gold reserves, Russia’s Central Bank yesterday ordered the interest rate raised from 0.25 to 3.5 percent and
Putin ordered the export ban on wheat and grain crops lifted by July 1st ina move designed to fill the
Motherlands coffers with money that normally would have flowed to the US.

The American peoples ability to know the truth of these things, and as always, has been shouted out by their
propaganda media organs leaving them in danger of not being prepared for the horrific economic collapse of
their nation now believed will much sooner than later.

process because he had played a role, a quarter-century earlier, in prosecuting the death-row inmate
whose habeas corpus petition he was hearing. The passage of time and involvement of others do not
vitiate the taint but heighten “the need for objective rules preventing the operation of bias that might
otherwise be obscured,” the justices wrote. A single biased individual “might still have an influence

that, while not so visible . . . is nevertheless significant.”

In addition to the numerous anti-Trump messages uncovered by the inspector general, there is a strong
circumstantial case—including personnel, timing, methods and the absence of evidence—that

Crossfire was initiated for political, not national-security, purposes.

It was initiated in defiance of a longstanding Justice Department presumption against investigating

with two busloads of friends from the kibbutz. Avraham Arnan was there, of
course. But Ahraleh Yariv and Eli Zeira, two of the military intelligence heroes
of the Six-Day War, also drove up for the wedding, which touched both Nava
and me, not to mention her family and our guests. Years later, as I rose higher in
the ranks of the military, I would sometimes be invited to weddings by officers
under my command. Remembering how much we appreciated Ahraleh’s and Eli
Zeira’s gesture. I always said yes.

It was only weeks after our wedding that I formally returned to Sayeret
Matkal. Both Nava and I were aware of the additional pressures my military
commitments might place on our family life. But she understood why I’d
chosen to go back, and was supportive. As for me, I was, if anything, more
certain that I’d made the right decision. Israel was clearly facing a whole new
set of challenges to its security. Given the decisiveness, and speed, of our
victory in 1967, there seemed no immediate danger of Egypt’s risking another
full-scale war. In Israel, where Golda Meir had become Prime Minister after
Eshkol’s death from a heart attack, there was also little appetite for returning to
the battlefield. Yet the post-war skirmishes with the Egyptians along the Suez
Canal had escalated into far more than that: what would become known as the
War of Attrition. Nor could there be any doubt, after Karameh, that Fatah’s
influence, militancy and determination would only grow, not least because even
more radical factions within the PLO were ready to step into the breach if
Arafat faltered. Israel needed to find an answer for all these threats.

Uzi Yairi’s term as Sayeret Matkal commander had by now ended, but his
successor was someone I knew well. Menachem Digli was the officer on whom
I’d bestowed my stolen Syrian Mercedes at the end of the war. His leg was now
recovered from the motorcycle accident, and I returned to the sayeret at his
deputy. He delegated full responsibility to me for operational issues. I believed
that the new kind of challenges we were confronting, particularly the prospect
of intensified attacks from the new generation of Palestinian fedaveen, meant
that the sayeret would sooner or later have to broaden its reach, moving beyond
the kind of intelligence operations we’d done before the 1967 war to become

G Five years on

Robert Lawrence Kuhn

Historical starting point for new stage of development

he 19th National Congress of the

Communist Party of China,

which begins on October 18, will

set the leadership and establish
the policies for the next five years, at least.
While Party national congresses are
always seminal events in the political life
of the country, there is reason to expect
that this congress will have even greater
and longer-reaching impact.

The context of the 19th
CPC National Congress is
the grand vision for Chi-
na presented by CPC
Central Committee Gen-
eral Secretary Xi Jinping,
who is now the “core” of
“the CPC Central Com-
mittee and of the whole
Party” It is an epic narra-
tive of what China has
remarkably achieved, what China has yet to
do, and what China envisages as necessary
to become a great nation.

Xi’s grand vision is famously expressed as
“the Chinese Dream’; described as “the
great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation’,
which has personal and national implica-
tions. It is specified by two overarching
goals: the two centenary goals of establish-
ing a moderately prosperous society by
2020 — the 100th anniversary of the CPC is
2021 — and establishing China as a “fully
modernized, socialist nation” by the 100th
anniversary of the People’s Republic of Chi-
na in 2049.

The first goal, which includes the total
elimination of extreme poverty in the coun-
try, will likely be achieved within the five-
year term of the 19th CPC National
Congress. It is the second goal that is of spe-
cial interest at this time, because in drawing
the roadmap and formulating the policies
to achieve China’s mid-century goal, this
Congress may set the agenda for the next
30-plus years.

The CPC national congresses are the
highest authority of CPC governance and
decision-making. The CPC constitutional
provision of holding congresses every five
years was reaffirmed by Deng Xiaoping in
the early days of reform (in part to establish
order and collective responsibility after a
period of chaos and political vicissitudes),
and since 1982, Party congresses have been
held scrupulously on schedule.

The congresses establish the senior lead-
ership of the Party and hence the nation by
electing the CPC Central Committee, which
in turn elects all top Party positions, and
also the Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection; review and assess the achieve-
ments and challenges over the five years
since the previous Party Congress; set the
vision, goals and objectives, agenda and pri-
orities for the subsequent five years; revise
the Party constitution (to keep up with the
times); and project an image of unified pur-
pose and direction to engender national
confidence and commitment.

The review and assessment of the previ-
ous five years and setting the agenda and
priorities for the subsequent five years are
formally presented in the Report, delivered
by the general secretary representing the
outgoing Central Committee and thus
reflecting the consensus view of the Party
leadership. Ratified by the congress (after
minor modifications), it becomes the guid-
ing document that drives policy for the
incoming Central Committee.

On the day following a congress, the first
plenum of the new 19th Central Committee
is convened to elect the Party’s new senior
leadership, including the Political Bureau,
the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau (to which, in essence, everything in
China reports), and the general secretary of
the Central Committee. Also approved are
the Central Military Commission (which
oversees the People’s Liberation Army), the
Secretariat (which runs Party daily opera-
tions), and the head of the Central Commis-
sion for Discipline Inspection.

The planning for the national Party Con-
gress follows similar patterns. Beginning
more than a year in advance, it involves
both formal and informal processes. The
formal process includes the election or
appointment of about 2,300 delegates
(2,280 delegates at the 19th National Con-
gress) from among the Party’s over 89 mil-
lion members, at all levels and in all sectors,
and the preparation of the Report via an
elaborate system of extensive research in
targeted areas (involving thousands of
experts), solicitation of broad input, drafts
(or sections) circulated to numerous Party
experts and officials for comments, and iter-
ative intense reviews by higher bodies and
senior leaders. In addition, smaller groups
are assigned the more sensitive tasks of
amending the Party constitution and rec-
commending candidates for the new Central
Committee and senior leadership positions.

Final decisions for this year’s congress, as
well as final edits of the Report, were made
at the Seventh Plenum of the 18th CPC Cen-
tral Committee, held on Oct 11 to 14, days
prior to the opening ceremony of the 19th
CPC National Congress.

To understand the position and role of
CPC Central Committee General Secretary
Xi at the 19th Party National Congress, we
should appreciate what it means for Xi to

be the core. It was in October 2016, at the
Sixth Plenum of the 18th CPC Central Com-
mittee, that Xi was designated the “core” of
the CPC Central Committee and of the
entire Party. The appellation was an unam-
biguous assertion that China requires
strong leadership to maintain stability and
ensure development given China’s unprece-
dented, complex challenges: domestically,
slower growth, industrial overcapacity,
endemic pollution, unbalanced develop-
ment, income disparity, social injustice,
social service demands; and internationally,
regional conflicts, sluggish economies, vola-
tile markets, trade protectionism, ethnic
clashes, terrorism, geopolitical rivalries, and
territorial disputes.

Moreover, because China must deepen
reform to achieve the goal of being a moder-
ately prosperous society, the resistance of
entrenched interest groups must be over-
come. In fact, the necessity of having a lead-
ership core to maintain stability and
expedite reform was a primary factor relat-
ing to Xi’s elevation to be the core.

In addition, not only does Xi have the
responsibility for China’s transformation;
he is also accountable for it. He has shown
courage in combating rampant practice of
graft, bribery and illicit patronage. Xi’s
relentless anti-corruption campaign is
altering how officials in government and
managers in industry work, and even how
they think. And let no one assume that Xi’s
battle against corruption has been risk-free.

Xi as the core does not change the Party's
cardinal principle of “democratic central-
ism” The Party says it is encouraging the
democratic solicitation of input and feed-
back from Party members, lower-ranked
officials, and the general public; and
strengthening centralism through Xi’s core
leadership.

In acomplex world, given the diverse
interests and forces in Chinese society, the
Party asserts that the Chinese Dream can-
not be realized without unity. Strong leader-
ship is required to build and maintain unity
for China to continue its development.

When Xi received the core appellation, he
was already general secretary of the Party,
chairman of the Central Military Commis-
sion, and president of the country — the
three highest leadership positions in China
— so how does being the “core” augment his
perceived stature or actual power?

The 2016 Party plenum communique
confirmed that “the collective leadership
system ... must always be adhered to”,
Nonetheless, there must have been shifts in
terms of both the setting of the agenda and
making final decisions — or else making Xi
the core would have little meaning.

When foreigners dismiss the political
aphorisms of China’s leaders as simplistic
sloganeering, they miss an opportunity to
enrich their understanding. Chinese offi-
cials certainly hold Xi’s frameworks in high
esteem.

Xi’s thought for the Party, the inner-Party
directives, include the “eight regulations”
(against waste and perks); “four self-confi-
dences” (in the country’s development path,

The China model, Xi
said, successful at home,
also broadens the way
for developing countries
to modernize, thus
providing Chinese
wisdom and Chinese
solutions for problems
facing mankind.

theories, systems, culture of socialism with
Chinese characteristics); opposing the “four
evil winds” (formalism, bureaucracy,
hedonism, decadence); the “four greats”
(struggles, projects, enterprises, dreams).

The combined intent is to make Party
members, especially Party and government
officials, more dedicated, committed, com-
petent and loyal, with exemplary moral
standards of probity and rectitude. It is no
small order.

The Party’s unremitting anti-corruption
campaign, unprecedented under Xi, has
won strong public support and will certain-
ly continue. But some foreign analysts mis-
takenly see Xi’s anti-corruption campaign
as largely a tool of political power, thus
reflecting a superficial and one-dimension-
al understanding of China. Befitting the size
and complexity of the country, for almost
every decision of importance, China’s lead-
ers have multiple motivations.

For the anti-corruption campaign, these
motivations include respect for the rule of
law and judicial impartiality; effective func-
tioning of the Party devoid of personal
interests; public trust in the Party; efficient
economic resource allocations (corruption
distorts markets); expediting reform (by
breaking up “interest groups” that resist
reform); maintaining national unity (by
removing officials with non-standard politi-
cal ambitions); elevating morality of Chi-
nese society; restoring ethical standards of
Chinese civilization; and facilitating China’s
emergence as a world-business center and
global role model.

Xi’s thought for the country — his new
ideas, new strategies, new initiatives set
forth over the past five years — can be
encapsulated as the overall vision of the
“Five in One” construction (economic, polit-
ical, cultural, social, ecological); governance
of the country via his “Four Comprehen-
sives” (a moderately prosperous society;
deepening reform, strengthening the rule of
law, strictly governing the Party); and
renewed economic development via the
Five Major Development Concepts (innova-
tion, coordination, green, open, sharing),
plus “supply-side structural reform’,

Xi’s thought for national rejuvenation
includes a grand vision for global govern-
ance, consisting of eight big diplomatic con-
cepts: a global community of shared destiny
and future; win-win cooperation; economic
globalization; fairer global governance; a
new kind of major power relationship;
expanding cooperation while managing dif-
ferences; multilateralism; and people-to-
people exchanges. Moreover, Xi’s Belt and
Road Initiative — facilitating economic
development in developing countries, espe-
cially by building much-needed infrastruc-
ture — is China's “project of the century”,

China recognizes it has international
responsibilities and seeks to uphold a com-
mon, comprehensive, cooperative and sus-
tainable security strategy. China’s own.
requirement is to protect the country’s
three sacrosanct “core interests” — its polit-
ical system, economic development, and
national sovereignty (territorial integrity).

China appreciates that to be a major
country, with its political influence reflect-
ing its economic strength, and also to pro-
tect its own core interests, its diplomacy
must be pro-active. China does not claim
that its “China model” can be adopted by
other countries, but the world should
understand Xi’s principles of governance as
optimally suited for China’s domestic condi-
tions.

Party congresses have similar styles and
to casual observers, they can all seem much
the same. But they do have differences,
which are usually subtle and often mean-
ingful.

For the 19th National Congress, some of
the things to look out for are:

Are political frameworks and policies
stated in their expected forms? If so, confi-
dence in political and economic stability is
reinforced.

How is General Secretary Xi Jinping’s sta-
tus as “core” further stressed, as expected?

Who are the members of the new Stand-
ing Committee of the Political Bureau and.
what are their portfolios?

Assuming the Party Constitution is
amended to include Xi’s new ideas, new
strategies, new initiatives, will they be given
an overarching label?

What is the composition of the new Cen-
tral Committee?

In listing the essential economic, politi-
cal, cultural, social and ecological policies,
are there shifts of emphasis that, however
nuanced, suggest changing priorities?

For deepening reform, surely stressed,
what targets are specified? For example,
what will be stated explicitly about State-
owned enterprise reform?

Environmental protection is a high prior-
ity, but what specific regulations and
enhanced enforcements distinguish the
fight against pollution under Xi from those
of previous congresses?

Many social areas will be highlighted —
for example, education, healthcare, rural
land reform, migrant worker residencies —
but do any stand out?

As already affirmed, the anti-corruption
campaign will continue, but will its intensi-

SHI YU / CHINA DAILY

ty or direction change in any manner, will it
be institutionalized? How will the forth-
coming National Supervisory Commission
work?

What is the relative prominence of mili-
tary reform and modernization?

What is the relative prominence of inter-
national affairs, given the high-profile Belt
and Road Initiative and China’s intense,
pro-active diplomacy?

Forecasting the 19th CPC National Con-
gress is not all guesswork and triangulating
rumors. Following tradition, Xi offered to
Party leaders a preview of his Report.
Speaking on July 26, he outlined China’s
achievements since the previous national
congress: new concepts of development,
deepened reform, enhanced rule of law,
strengthened environmental protection,
and a more capable military.

China, Xi said, has, after suffering centu-
ry-long hardships and tribulations, taken
three historic leaps, from standing-up to
becoming better-off to becoming stronger.
Xi called for a comprehensive, strategic and
forward-looking action program, highlight-
ing the success and vitality of socialism with
Chinese characteristics, the increasing
strength of the Party, and China’s expanding
circle of friends in the international com-
munity. In China, he stressed, political legit-
imacy is founded on competence and
accomplishment.

Significantly, Xi asserted that China’s
development stands at a new historic start-
ing point and that socialism with Chinese
characteristics is entering a new develop-
ment stage. The CPC cannot rest on its lau-
rels, he stressed. The country faces daunting
challenges. He warned the Party against
self-satisfaction and blind optimism.

Xi’s comments resonated with his core
values and bear witness to his consistency.
In 2006, then Zhejiang Party Secretary Xi
told me that China should be proud of its
successes, but its “achievements should not
engender complacency’, adding “we need to
assess ourselves objectively”:

Preparing for the upcoming congress, Xi
recognizes that the people's desire for a hap-
pier life is stronger than ever. They want
better education, higher incomes, stable
jobs, reliable social insurance, higher quali-
ty healthcare, more comfortable living con-
ditions, a more beautiful environment and
aricher cultural life.

And there has been an inflection point in
China’s international perspective, reflecting
the nation’s consequential global engage-
ment. The China model, Xi said, successful
at home, also broadens the way for develop-
ing countries to modernize, thus providing
Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions for
problems facing mankind.

The influence of the 19th CPC National
Congress and the impact of Xi Jinping’s
thought seem for decades to come.

32. Between 1999 and 2007, with the assistance of numerous co-conspirators, Epstein
abused more than thirty (30) minor underage girls, a fact confirmed by state and federal law
enforcement.

Roberts’ assignments from Epstein was to bring a young girl back to Epstein in the United

for sex or transported them across state lines. Epstein is currently charged by

the State of Florida with soliciting young prostitutes for sex - but federal

charges would be far more serious.

The Palm Beach Post reported yesterday that Epstein is very close to a deal

with the feds that would send him to jail for 1% to 2 years. Sources tell us that

while a deal has not yet solidified, what's under discussion is a guilty plea to

at least one charge in exchange for a sentence of 15 months in a Florida state

prison, followed by 15 months of home confinement. That would be a fraction

of the time he would have to serve if he were to be convicted by a jury.

Epstein's spokesman, Howard Rubenstein, said his client would have no

comment. Dershowitz also declined to comment late yesterday.

Palm Beach police records show that on March 15, 2005, a 14-year-old girl

alleged she had visited Epstein's estate, where she partially stripped and

gave him a massage during which he pulled out a purple vibrator and used it

on her in exchange for $300. A further probe uncovered five young women

who said Epstein had masturbated and touched their genitals during

massages, the records state. A woman named Haley Robson - who

described herself as like a Heidi Fleiss - later admitted bringing six girls

between the ages of 14 and 16 to Epstein's house, according to cops.

Despite the allegations, Epstein was only nailed on a single charge of

soliciting a hooker - but it sparked a federal probe. Epstein's lawyers and

friends have insisted he was the hapless victim of a vendetta by Palm Beach

Police Chief Michael Reiter, whom they described as a born-again nutcase.

Palm Beach Post - 08/14/ 2006

Police chief's reputation helps discredit attacks

By Larry Keller

Palm Beach Post - Monday, August 14, 2006

In the case of Palm Beach financier Jeffrey Epstein, it seems, at times, as if two men are
accused of wrongdoing: Epstein and Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter.

Epstein, 53, was indicted last month on a charge of felony solicitation of prostitution
solely because of Reiter's craziness, one of Epstein's lawyers said. His department
disseminated a distorted view of the case and behaved in a childish manner when the
grand jury didn't indict Epstein on the charges it sought, another Epstein lawyer
complained.

To hear the Epstein camp tell it, Reiter, 48, is a loose cannon better suited to be the
sheriff of Mayberry. They whisper that he's embroiled in a messy divorce.

Reiter did in fact file for divorce from his wife, (NAME REMOVED), last year, after 24
years of marriage. They have a son, 18, and a daughter, 14. The couple is scheduled to go
to mediation next week, Aug. 16. Nothing in the court file suggests their split is
particularly ugly.

Reiter incurred the wrath of the Epstein camp as well as the state attorney's office for two

reasons. First, he pressed for Epstein to be charged with the more serious crimes of

TEXT-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022970.txt,"﻿How Prince Andrew shared a room at Epstein's Caribbean hideaway
with a busty blonde who claimed she was a brain surgeon
By Angella Johnson
Updated: 21:26 EST, 12 March 2011
The official-looking document, left casually on a desk, marked the beginning of the end for Cathy and
Miles Alexander’s eight years managing Jeffrey Epstein’s private Caribbean island, Little St James.
‘It said Warrant of Arrest, in big bold letters,’ recalls Cathy.
‘I picked it up and saw Mr Epstein’s name on it.’
Inside view: Catherine and Miles managed Epstein's private island for several years
Shocked, she ran out of the room to tell her husband ‘something bad is going on’.
Indeed it was, for the shamed financier, a close friend of Prince Andrew (who visited the island at least
three times), had been arrested the previous day for under-age sex activities.
But 24 hours after his arrest in July 2006, a visibly pale and shell-shocked Epstein stood in his designer
kitchen complaining to the South African couple who had run his island paradise since 1999 that he was a
victim of entrapment.
Speaking at their home in South Africa, where they live in semi-retirement, the Alexanders reveal they had
watched with increasing concern the beautiful girls who paraded about the house topless or naked
whenever their boss was in residence – until Cathy became so disturbed that she insisted they part
company with Epstein in 2007, a year before he was sentenced to 18 months in jail for solicitation of
prostitution.
Paradise retreat: Little St James, a private 72-acre island three miles off the east coast of St
Thomas in the U.S. Virgin islands owned by America billionaire Jeffrey Epstein
‘I saw some girls who I thought were very young-looking – about 16 or 17 easily – and it bugged me
because I have a daughter and, although she was in her 20s, I didn’t like the idea that another woman’s
child was in that situation. I didn’t feel comfortable about it,’ she said.
‘They looked like they had stepped out of an underwear catalogue. They walked around with very few
clothes on or lounged around by the pool with nothing on. It was like that most of the time. I was
concerned about their ages. A few of them looked very young and I couldn’t help but wonder if their
mothers knew where they were.
‘One very young-looking girl was called Tila. I just thought, “You really shouldn’t be here”, but I made
myself switch off as I had no proof.’
The couple, who have been married for 24 years, still
find it hard to comprehend that Epstein is a convicted
sex offender.
Island guest: Model Naomi Campbell stayed as a guest on
Epstein's Caribbean island
‘He was a very kind man and, while I don’t approve of things he’s been accused of, I liked him very much,’
says Miles.
While Cathy says she was always suspicious about the girls’ ages, Miles insists: ‘I took the view that what
went on behind closed doors was not my business and it is not my place to judge. If anything was going on
we didn’t want to know.
‘Our job was about discretion. We have a clear conscience that we didn’t witness anything untoward.
Whatever went on at the other houses – and yes, we heard things from other members of staff – it didn’t,
to my knowledge, happen at our property.’
Miles also says that on several occasions he refused Epstein’s requests to smuggle female guests in by
boat, to circumvent the strict immigration policies of St Thomas, the island with authority over Little St
James, which would have meant logging names and passport numbers.
But he was aware that Epstein found others to do his bidding. For as the couple were told when they were
hired: ‘What Jeffrey wants, Jeffrey gets.’
The words came from Ghislaine Maxwell, who was then Epstein’s girlfriend. She flew to South Africa with
Andrew Shannon, a lawyer, to interview the Alexanders in 1998, after they had replied to a small ad for
‘management couple sought to run private island’.
After apparently passing the interview, they were invited to meet Epstein in New York.
‘It was very strange,’ said Miles. ‘We were taken by a driver to an office near Madison Square Garden. A
gentleman wearing a polo shirt and jeans stepped out of the lift, asked if we had a good trip, shook our
hands and left. That was it. Then Miss Maxwell came back and said we had the job.’
Ghislaine then took them to ‘the big house’ in Manhattan, which is said to have been the scene of sex
parties and where young girls were allegedly hired as playthings for Epstein’s wealthy male friends.
‘We spent five days there shadowing the staff to see how they did things,’ says Cathy.
‘A dinner party was held on the fourth night, but it was very formal and businesslike. I saw no girls –
young or otherwise – at the time. We would never have willingly put ourselves in that kind of situation.’
The following day they were flown to St Thomas and transferred by boat to Epstein’s island house, a
sprawling single-storey complex with white walls and a blue roof, maintained by several gardeners, two
boat captains, two laundry ladies and two other women who cared for the house.
Again the couple were there to observe, but after three days they were woken in the night by a phone call
telling them they had to leave the island because a VIP was making an unexpected visit. They were later
told by staff that the guest had been Prince Andrew.
They went back to New York, where Ghislaine explained more of their duties.
‘She said we had to keep quiet about what we saw or heard on the island,’ Cathy recalls.
‘She told us that although Mr Epstein and she were a couple, we would see lots of beautiful girls passing in
and out, but that was his nature.
‘She said that he gets what he wants but that she was always the “Queen Bee” and the one in charge.
‘She often described herself in this way. Although she could be very friendly, I discovered that she was also
rather arrogant.’
Miles took up his post in March 1999 and Cathy followed a month later. Miles realised the kind of lifestyle
their boss enjoyed when, on his first day, Epstein arrived with five young ladies in tow.
‘One was definitely under age, but she had a letter of consent from her parents and was under the
guardianship of a model agency,’ he says.
The Alexanders admit finding a box of sex toys in
Epstein’s bedroom, but insist they never saw nor
Friends in high places: Lord Mandelson has also
vacationed on Epstein's island
organised any raunchy parties for him or his guests. Cathy recalls that Prince Andrew was the first guest to
visit during their tenure.
‘The Duke came via helicopter with his bodyguard and a woman in her 30s, who said she was a brain
surgeon,’ Cathy says dryly.
‘She was tall, bleached blonde and had big boobs. They shared a room and spent most of their time on the
beach windsurfing, sailing or doing other water sports.
‘One day he came back into the house in great mirth. He said that his guest had stepped on a sea urchin
and he urinated on her foot as a remedy. “The royal member has done its duty,” he chuckled. He was great
fun and very undemanding.’
The Prince stayed for two weeks and left a tip of $350 (£220).
‘He slipped it into my hand when we said goodbye,’ says Miles.
‘It was unexpected because other guests didn’t.’
Andrew would visit at least once more, that they recall, with Ghislaine and Epstein.
‘He also flew over the island on his way to Montserrat after the volcano had erupted and got the pilot to
dip the wings as a signal to us.’
The Prince’s ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, who became embroiled in the Epstein controversy last week when it
was revealed that she had accepted £15,000 from the sex offender to pay her debts, visited once with her
daughters. Epstein refused a second request for her to visit on her own.
‘Lots of people came and went,’ says Miles. ‘It was like running a five-star hotel where no one paid.’
Others who passed through included model Naomi Campbell, who arrived for two days with what Miles
and Cathy called her ‘coffin’ – a huge oversized trunk filled with clothes.
Peter Mandelson holidayed there with his long-term boyfriend Reinaldo, who suffered sunburn and
whined about it ‘like a baby’, says Cathy.
Numerous academics, architects and some of the most prominent scientific and business minds also
enjoyed Epstein’s generous hospitality.
‘I can only surmise he might have wanted favours from these people,’ Miles suggests.
For all his wealth, Epstein appears to have led a simple life on the island.
‘Dinner was very informal, he never drank alcohol and we rarely had it in stock.
‘He also had a habit of not eating meals in front of people. Instead he would have nibbles such as crab
cakes in his room.’
His most obvious luxury on the island were his daily massages. Former Epstein ‘masseuse’ Virginia
Roberts says these were usually little more than foreplay to a sex act.
According to the Alexanders, whatever went on was performed in his bedroom.
‘We were warned by Miss Maxwell never to disturb him there. It was absolutely forbidden,’ they say.
Between 1999 and 2004, Epstein would visit at least once a month and Ghislaine was invariably with him.
Miles says: ‘In our final meeting, he told me I had always been his conscience. I’m certainly battling with
my conscience now.’
Riddle of phone numbers for ‘friends’ he’d never met
Revealing an extraordinary network of power and influence, extending into the fields of politics, finance
and showbusiness, Jeffrey Epstein’s ‘little black book’ showed just how important a man he had become.
Yet when The Mail on Sunday contacted the people listed in the document, which was kept online, many
said they had never met or even spoken to the disgraced financier.
And they were appalled to discover he had their contact details, often including home and mobile
telephone numbers.
Lord Palumbo, the former Arts Council chairman and godfather to the Duke of York’s eldest daughter
Beatrice, said: ‘I have never, never, met him. I am shocked I am in there. I am affronted. I don’t know him
at all.’
Never heard of him: Both Toby Young (left) and Sir Richard Branson, were surprised to
find themselves listed in a contacts books owned by Jeffrey Epstein
Dame Gail Ronson, a charity fundraiser and wife of the multi-millionaire British developer Gerald
Ronson, said: ‘I’ve never, ever, met him. I swear, you’ve completely gobsmacked me. It’s really distressing,
horrible.
‘I lead a very private life so to find out you’re on this list, it’s very unsavoury.’
Her shock was echoed by the celebrity milliner Philip Treacy.
‘This sounds crazy, I’m amazed,’ he said.
‘I’m a hatmaker, I’ve never met Jeffrey Epstein and never had any reason to. I make hats. Does he look
like the kind of person who would wear a hat? Bizarre.’
The ‘book’ also had numbers for the JCB tycoon Sir Anthony Bamford, but a spokesman insisted: ‘There
doesn’t appear to be any connection. Sir Anthony doesn’t know Jeffrey Epstein.’
The journalist Toby Young, said: ‘I’ve never been within 100 yards of him and we move in completely
separate worlds. If you said I was in Colonel Gaddafi’s Little Black Book I couldn’t be less surprised.’
There were also numbers for the influential Rothschild family, including Sir Evelyn de Rothschild and his
daughter Hannah. Last night she said: ‘I have no idea why Mr Epstein would have my numbers as I don’t
know him.’
A print-out of the contacts book came to light after it was subpoenaed for use in a civil case against the
financier by one of the young girls he employed as a masseuse.
The list included 16 numbers for Prince Andrew under his title The Duke of York.
His ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, was entered under the Duchess of York and there were 18 numbers for her
and her associates as well as an email address.
The ‘book’ also appeared to contain contacts of Epstein’s former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, including
her extended family, friends and brief acquaintances.
One prominent journalist, who asked not to be named, was horrified to discover her parents’ details were
listed. She said: ‘I knew Ghislaine once but that was more than 20 years ago. To be honest
I find it really spooky.’
Artist Kate Stracher was also baffled by her inclusion.
She said: ‘Ghislaine and I were at Oxford together but I haven’t seen her since. I’m not at all glamorous
and not at all well-connected. I definitely shouldn’t be there.’
Others have had only the briefest of meetings. Philippe Amon, a Swiss industrialist, said: ‘I think I came
across Epstein some years ago in New York but I honestly don’t think I would recognise him walking by in
the street.’
A spokesman for Richard Branson said: ‘Jeffrey Epstein has the island next door to Necker but Richard
has literally only met him once for about five minutes. That’s the extent of it.’
Those who clearly do have a connection are, perhaps unsurprisingly, less keen to talk about it.
Lisa Walker is listed alongside her friend Caroline Stanbury, a former girlfriend of Prince Andrew.
She said: ‘I met Epstein with Caroline.’
Asked if Prince Andrew was also present, Miss Walker said: ‘I wish I could help but I don’t think I should
say any more.’
Police chief’s fury over plea bargain
Michael Reiter was a popular small-town police chief
with a lifetime’s experience in finding the balance
Leaned on: Police chief Michael Reiter
between patrolling the millionaire’s playground of Palm Beach, Florida, and its blue-collar neighbour
West Palm Beach, home to unglamorous social housing projects and trailer parks.
Throughout his 28-year career, he prided himself that his force treated the wealthy on his patch just the
same as the very poorest. But his investigation into the lifestyle of predatory paedophile Jeffrey Epstein
exploded his illusion that law enforcement could ever be impartial.
He soon discovered at first hand that a man such as Epstein, with almost unlimited wealth and influential
friends including former President Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew and Israeli defence minister Ehud Barak,
can effectively bend the law to his whim.
The 53-year-old police chief, who retired in 2009, was so furious at what he believed was obstruction by
state prosecutors, who he felt had downplayed charges against Epstein, that he outlined his frustrations in
an extraordinary letter to Florida state attorney Barry Krischer in May 2006.
He wrote: ‘I must urge you to examine the unusual course that your office’s handling of this matter has
taken and consider if good and sufficient reason exists to require your disqualification from the
prosecution of these cases.’
After failing to get a satisfactory response from prosecutors he believed had been ‘got at’ by Epstein, he
referred the case to the FBI.
He wrote to one of Epstein’s victims, saying: ‘I do not feel that justice has been sufficiently served by the
indictment that has been issued.’
Epstein’s conviction for solicitation of prostitution came after an unprecedented plea bargain designed to
protect him from future charges.
Mr Reiter later complained in sworn testimony connected to civil actions brought against Epstein that
prominent politicians had repeatedly leaned on him to downplay the allegations against the financier.
Mike Fisten, an ex-FBI taskforce superviser who has led the campaign for the Epstein case to be reopened,
said: ‘Reiter went up against the entire town of Palm Beach to do what was right but he is not chief any
more because of this.
‘And eventually Epstein was given an immunity from prosecution deal the like of which I have never seen
in my entire career.’

Children normally make judgments about the behavior of their
parents and friends as well. In all these cases, judgment is best taught
by having a student watch the behavior of others, keeping himself out
of the issue and seeing what factors motivated and determined the
behavior of the actors. It is a lot easier to teach proper behavior when
it is not one’s own behavior that is being judged. One can learn to act
by judging how others act.

So, children make judgments all the time. Typically those judg-
ments reflect the values that they have been taught at home. Children
decide what is good and what is bad mostly based on what they have
been told. No child discovers for himself that George Washington was
an admirable man. No child decides on his own that the United States
is the best country in the world. These things are taught by parents
and by schools. School, to the extent that it serves as a place of in-
doctrination, has always succeeded at producing citizens who believe
what they are taught to believe at a young age. There obviously is a
great deal of sentiment for keeping indoctrination as a key part of
education, but teaching judgment means allowing children to come
to conclusions based on their own experience and not merely what
they were told.

Learning to make judgments is a process of deciding for oneself
what is true, which is, of course, not so easy. This should be the role of
school but it usually isn’t. School wants to teach us the truth when, in
fact, truth is best discovered, again, from experience.

How would one discover the “best country in the world,” if that
is a meaningful idea, or whether George Washington was all he was
cracked up to be? Obviously, travel helps teach one about countries.
Kids can learn about countries by simulated travel in the modern era.
But the point wouldn’t be so much to teach them that they make good
cheese in France, which is the kind of thing school does today, but to
think about what makes France different from the United States. Simi-
larly, we can read and learn some facts about George Washington, and
these are indeed taught to children in primary school. I do not believe
that children are equipped at a young age to determine for themselves
whether Washington was a good man. Perhaps that would be a worth-
while assignment in high school, as long as students were interested
in the question and were allowed to come to any conclusion that they
could reasonably defend. But children of 5 or 6 can understand what

have canceled elective surgery for lack of supplies. Electricity
remains maddeningly irregular. The much-publicized opening of the
Egyptian border has fizzled, so people remain trapped here. The
number of residents living on less than $1.60 a day has tripled in four
years. Three-quarters of the population rely on food aid.

Areas with as contested a history as this one can choose among
anniversaries to commemorate. It has been four years since Hamas
took over, prompting Israel and Egypt to impose a blockade on
people and most goods. It is a year since a Turkish flotilla challenged
the siege and Israeli commandos killed nine activists aboard the
ships, leading to international outrage and an easing of conditions.
And it is five years since an Israeli soldier, Staff Sgt. Gilad Shalit,
was abducted and held in captivity without even visits from the Red
Cross.

In assessing the condition of the 1.6 million people who live in Gaza,
there are issues of where to draw the baseline and — often — what
motivates the discussion. It has never been among the world’s
poorest places. There is near universal literacy and relatively low
infant mortality, and health conditions remain better than across
much of the developing world.

“We have 100 percent vaccination; no polio, measles, diphtheria or
AIDS,” said Mahmoud Daher, a World Health Organization official
here. “We’ve never had a cholera outbreak.”

The Israeli government and its defenders use such data to portray
Gaza as doing just fine and Israeli policy as humane and appropriate:
no flotillas need set sail.

Israel’s critics say the fact that the conditions in Gaza do not rival the
problems in sub-Saharan Africa only makes the political and human
rights crisis here all the more tragic — and solvable. Israel, they note,
still controls access to sea, air and most land routes, and its security
policies have consciously strangled development opportunities for an

BREYER, J., dissenting

. as,” provide no greater help. The majority finds sup-
port for its dynamic interpretation in the Civil Rights Act
of 1866, which gives all citizens the “same right” to make
and enforce contracts and to buy and sell property “as is
enjoyed by white citizens.” 42 U.S.C. §§1981(a), 1982
(emphasis added). But it is purpose, not words, that read-
ily resolves any temporal linguistic ambiguity in that
statute. The Act’s objective, like that of the Fourteenth
Amendment itself, was a Nation that treated its citizens
equally. Its purpose—revealed by its title, historical
context, and other language in the statute—was “to guar-
antee the then newly freed slaves the same legal rights
that other citizens enjoy.” CBOCS West, Inc. v. Hum-
phries, 553 U.S. 442, 448 (2008). Given this purpose, its
dynamic nature is obvious.

Similarly, judges interpreting the words “same ... as”
have long resolved ambiguity not by looking at the words
alone, but by examining the statute’s purpose as well.
Compare, e.g., Kugler’s Appeal, 55 Pa. 128, 128-125 (1867)
(adopting a dynamic interpretation of “same as” statute in
light of “plain” and “manifest” statutory purpose); and
Gaston v. Lamkin, 115 Mo. 20, 34, 21 S.W. 1100, 1104
(1898) (adopting a dynamic interpretation of “same as”
election statute given the legislature’s intent to achieve
“simplicity and uniformity in the conduct of elections”),
with O'Flynn v. East Rochester, 292 N.Y. 156, 162, 54
N. E. 2d 348, 346 (1944) (adopting a static interpretation
of “same as” statute given that the legislature “did not
contemplate” that subsequent changes to a referenced
statute would apply (interpreting N. Y. Gen. Mun. Law
Ann. §860(5) (West 1984))). There is no hard-and-fast rule
that the statutory words “as is” or the statutory words
“same as’ require applying the law as it stands today.

The majority wrongly believes that it can solve the
temporal problem by bringing statutory canons into play.
It relies on what it calls the “reference canon.” That canon,

IMAGES-001-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011735.txt,"Syria was always going to be harder. But Rabin had moved past his anger
over the “pocket deposit”, and we began a new effort via the Americans. Our
aim was to lay out a comprehensive, staged proposal to trade nearly the entire
Golan for peace. With Rabin, Itamar Rabinovich and the rest of the team, we
put together a framework limiting Syria’s military presence on the Heights. We
envisaged phasing out the restrictions as Syria took steps toward the kind of
peace which had proved possible with Egypt and Jordan. But indirect exchanges
in the autumn of 1994 produced little progress. In December, Rabin proposed to
the Americans that I meet with a Syrian representative, and President Assad
agreed. Later that month, I was sent to Washington for talks with Syria’s
ambassador, Walid Muallem. With the Americans’ Mideast envoy, Dennis
Ross, as host, we met in Blair House across the street from the White House.

I began by explaining the security provisions we envisaged for the Golan,
which included early-warning provisions, force limitations and other means of
safeguarding Israel against any surprise attack. Muallem’s response was
formulaic, almost icy, with no indication he was ready to discuss any of the
specifics, much less offer ideas of his own. But then Dennis led us out into the
garden, where the atmosphere, if sadly not the weather, was a bit warmer. I told
Ambassador Muallem I believed Israel’s issues with Syria ought to be
resolvable. Both sides understood the broad terms of an eventual peace. But we
needed a context of trust in which to negotiate. President Assad, and we as well,
were always going to be reluctant formally to commit ourselves to a position
until each side was be satisfied that the other side understood its core needs.
Politically, both sides also faced constraints. “In formal meetings, a record is
taken and negotiators have to explain and justify every last word back home,” I
said. “I think our negotiators can get further in conversations like the one we’re
having now.” Though Muallem nodded agreement, he did not explicitly say he
believed that informal exchanges were the way forward. Still, he did obviously
pass back a broadly positive message to Damascus. Before the Blair House
discussion, our understanding had been there would probably be a kind of
mirror arrangement for a follow-up meeting: between our ambassador in
Washington, Itamar Rabinovich, and a high-ranking army officer from the
Syrian side. Instead, we received word that Assad wanted me to meet directly
with General Himat Shihabi, who was not only my counterpart as Syrian chief-
of-staff but Assad’s oldest and closest political ally and the effective number-
two man in the régime.

General Shihabi and I met over a period of two days at Blair House. He had
greater authority, and thus a greater sense of self-assurance, than the

Greenwald was an activist as well as a journalist. Like Poitras, he joined the board of directors
of the Freedom of the Press Foundation. The foundation, which eventually Runa Sandvik and
Micah Lee would join, had been set up expressly to funnel money to both Assange’s Wikileaks
site and the defense fund for Bradley Manning after he was arrested. Such a money laundry was
necessary because, as will be recalled, American credit card companies were blocking money
transfers to these two causes. This “blockade” was taking its toll on Wikileaks. According to
Assange, “WikiLeaks had been cut off from more than 90 percent of its finances.” So the
Freedom of the Press Foundation came to its rescue. John Perry Barlow, one of the song writers
for the Grateful Dead band, was one of its chief financial backers. “The first serious info war is
now engaged, Barlow declared. “The field of battle is WikiLeaks.” He served with Greenwald and
Poitras on its Board in December 2012.

Snowden was an avid reader of Greenwald’s screeds against the government. If he was to
assume the role of a modern-day Prometheus, delivering forbidden secrets of the NSA to the
public, Greenwald would be a logical candidate to break the story. Snowden could safely assume
that Greenwald would be sympathetic to exposing NSA surveillance from his many blogs, tweets
and YouTube comments on the subject. For example, on November 13 2012, just 18 days before
Snowden contacted him, Greenwald had written a blog in Guardian asserting that the United
States was “a surveillance state run amok.” In it, echoing very closely what Snowden said at his
Crypto party, Greenwald wrote that “any remnants of internet anonymity have been all but
obliterated by the union between the state and technology companies.” Citing a story in the
Washington Post, he continued: “Every day, collection systems at the National Security Agency
intercept and store 1.7 billion e-mails, phone calls and other types of communications. Asa
result, Greenwald called for action in his blog on November 13, 2012, writing: “The US
operates a sprawling, unaccountable Surveillance State that, in violent breach of the core
guarantees of the Fourth Amendment, monitors and records virtually everything even the most
law-abiding citizens do.” That same week Snowden invited Runa Sandvik to co-host his crypto

party.

One problem for Snowden was reaching out to Greenwald was Greenwald's lack of any
encryption for his e-mails. Communicating with a journalist like Greenwald who famously
attacked the very organization for which he worked was itself a risky undertaking, especially if he
wanted to pass classified NSA documents to him. If his emails were intercepted by the NSA in
Brazil (where Greenwald lived) and where the NSA was not restricted by US law, he could lose
his job or even be arrested. Under his alias Cincinnatus, he told Greenwald that he needed to
immediately encrypt his computer. To make his point, he cited Greenwald’s own November 12,
2012 blog. In it, Greenwald noted that General David Petraeus, then the CIA director, had been
caught in a minor sex scandal because his personal emails had been intercepted, Snowden wrote
Greenwald that Petraeus would not have been exposed if he had used encryption. Snowden also
sent Greenwald instruction on how to install the necessary encryption software and a link to a 12-

capital except through textbooks and tuition. Some happens. I went back to school at
the Conservatory myself, and I buy lots of textbooks. But I just don’t see enough of it
around me. Models must simplify. Mine would end invested consumption at

independence more or less.

I would also model adult self-invested work as subliminal and costless job
experience. I don’t see it as taking a second away from work for pay. This again is
meant to describe the usual rule only. Ben-Porath’s model, I think, allows an
impression that workers can choose between earning and learning by allocation of
time. The quotes from Schultz in Chapter 5 described that as common. I just don’t
see much of it happening. Rather we tend to work fewer hours at the end of careers,

not the beginning or middle when time for recovery of self-invested work remains.

I said that Ben-Porath’s equations imply

pay = realized work.

I would substitute the pay rule

gross realized work
realized work + human depreciation
= work - self-invested work + human depreciation, (6.17)

pay

as a norm or expectation. It isn’t a guaranteed outcome because deadweight loss
happens to human capital too. We may be hit by a bus, or lose our jobs in a slump, or
be sent to prison or drafted into the army. The pay rule means that recovery is
foreseen. If (6.17) were stated in terms of outcomes, “recovered” would have to be

inserted before “human depreciation”.

FUNDAMENTAL EQUITY OPINION KEY: Opinions include a Volatility Risk Rating, an Investment Rating and an Income Rating. VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential
price fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst’s assessment of a stock’s: (i) absolute total return potential and (ii)
attractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). There are three investment ratings: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total
return of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than
Buy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12
month total return expectation for a stock and the firm’s guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be
referenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst’s view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).

enter the property at 358 El Brillo. Shortly thereafter, Williams
exited the property and placed the three white trash bags in the empty
well in the rear of the truck. Williams then drove away where he met
with Sgt. Szarszewski who removed the bags from the well and placed
them into one large black trash bag. The bag was returned to the

this view, the social level of organization
arises out of the interaction of lower-
level entities. But invisible forces
operate in both directions; one’s degree
of social integration or isolation (at the
higher level) can have profound
influence on one’s mental and physical
health (at the lower level). Just how
these forces operate—in both
directions—is one of the main themes of
this book.

A recurring theme is the human
need for connection. As we have
explored this fundamental need, it has
become clear that it can be satisfied in
part by connections not necessarily to
other human persons, but to other minds.
Since the minds of others are in part of
our own construction, connections to a
higher being, or to our pets, or even to a
transcendent order underlying the world,
can fulfill part of what we strive to
attain. Indeed, such non-human
attachments can share the character of
human connection: we can feel valued
by our pet (just as we can feel validated
in a social relationship), we can have an
intimate dyadic relationship with God
(just as we can be intimate with a close
friend), and we can feel a sense of
belonging to the universe (just as we can
feel that we belong to social group).
This explains how different, even
contradictory, notions of a relationship
to God, for instance, can lead different
people each to find meaning in such a
relationship: finding God on the
downtown bus versus encountering God
in the purposeful unfolding of the natural
order.

The ideas of symmetry,
complementarity, coordination, and co-
regulation also run through several of
our essays. Regulation of biological
systems is often maintained through

paired systems of biological checks and
balances; when one system is activated,
the other tends to restore equilibrium.
For instance, one set of muscles flexes
the arm, and an opposing set extends it.
We have seen that the sympathetic and
parasympathetic components of the
autonomic nervous system—the system
that makes us breathe and that makes our
heart pump—operate in this way, and
that chronic stimulation of some
systems, like overstretched elastic bands,
lose their ability to spring back. The
notions of observing a behavior and
performing that behavior not only are
conceptually similar, they may be rooted
in a common set of neurological
structures which may, in turn, help us to
understand how we can perceive another
human being as being /ike us, but not us.
Anthropomorphism is the belief that
other minds mirror our own; this colors
the way we perceive the world and the
other actors in it, a mechanism that
allows us to simulate getting under the
skin of the other person.

Happiness and loneliness are
perceptions about our place in the world
that profoundly affect our physical
bodies and our social relationships.
Religious beliefs, too, can have profound
effects on health and physical well-
being, working through the same
biological mechanisms that in health
maintain equilibrium.

Unseen, yet powerful, forces
regulate social behavior. Empathy, for
instance, contributes to the regulation of
social interactions. Synchronous
behavior points to a phenomenon that
makes the individual feel subsumed by
the group, feeling part of a larger,
organic whole. These behaviors can be
as disparate as “the wave” at a sports
stadium or congregational prayer at a
church service. Shared feelings of

Our PO of $1,100 is based on our SOP that values AWS at $127bn or $259 per share
and the retail business at $413bn or $841 per share. Our 5.5x AWS multiple is a modest
premium to the software/SaaS comp group at 5.0x on 2018 sales, and 0.9x multiple is a
premium to a retail general merchandise comp group at 0.7x. We think the premiums are
warranted given share gains and superior growth. Our $1,100 price objective implies
2.8x 2018E Price/Sales, a multiple above the high end of Amazon's historical range of
1.0-2.5x. We argue the historical P/S multiple should increase given positive 3rd party
sales (3P) that is reported on a net basis, a higher AWS revenue contribution, an
increasing advertising contribution, and record gross profit margins.

social pain that functions to motivate the
formation and renewal of meaningful
social relationships. When feelings of

IMAGES-003-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014916.txt,"Pandora (BUY, $9 PO)

Stock view: Focus on on-demand product, but questions on growth

Pandora’s recently launched on-demand subscription product will likely be the focus of
1Q investor call. Although the product is on limited release, we expect investor to focus
on initial reception of the product (positive reviews in media} and whether Pandora is
capable of growing the subscription base to 10mn over the next several years. Initially
Pandora will not likely see an impact on revenue from premium subscriptions as it is
giving current Pandora One subscribers a free six month trail of Pandora Premium which
may also impact subscription revenue for 1Q.

From our initial time with Pandora Premium, we found playlist creation smooth and easy
to use with Pandora quickly auto-filling play lists after picking a few songs, but Pandora
lacks the curated playlist selection found in Apple music and Spotify and we
encountered some missing songs/artists from the on-demand platform. The real
question will be whether Pandora’s platform is 1) good enough to pull exiting on-
demand users from other services to Pandora (Pandora indicated roughly 60% of
Pandora users are using another on-demand service); 2) can it convince people to
upgrade from free Pandora to Pandora Premium; and 3) how will Pandora grow its active
listener base from here. Pandora has had a largely stagnate active user base over the
last year and we think even with the new on-demand product could face difficulty
growing its users, especially as it increases its ad loads in key markets.

Key theme/metric(s) for 1Q: Ad rate growth and sub metrics

Pandora began rolling out Pandora Premium on March 15, and we think key questions
for the call will be; 1) initial reception of Pandora Premium; 2) when it will be fully
available to all users; 3) will Pandora Premium driving increased users; and 4) how have
ad load changes be received by free users. Pandora is increasing its ad load per hour to
increase its RPM rates, but this also risks alienating its already stagnant to declining
user base from the platform. 1Q will be the first measure to see if Pandora is able to
increase ad loads while maintaining its user base, the first step in stronger monetization
of its differentiated ad-supported radio product.

Biggest 1Q issues/risks:
¢ — Investment spending in quarter and outlook for future S&M/R&D spend;

¢ Outlook for when Pandora will reach profitability again.
« Active listener or listening hour declines due competition;
¢« Commentary on outlook for Pandora Premium

Top 1Q data points: Triton Internet radio data

Triton media releases Internet radio metrics which give an initial read into the quarter,
but is limited to January data, Triton data shows Avg. Active sessions (analogous to
listening hour growth) declined 3% y/y which is tracking below our 1% y/y listener hour
growth est. of 5.58 billion hours. Session starts were up 4% y/y above our est. of 1% y/y
active user growth. We note that Spotify is now tracking more session starts than
Pandora implying market share loss to Spotify. Given the leap year, we would expect
February to track down Y/Y for monthly active listeners and user growth in February.

Estimates vs. Consensus: Slightly above on revenue, below on EPS

Our rev/Non-GAAP EPS est. of $319mn/($0.49) is slightly above on revenue, but in-line
on EPS compared to the Street est. at $318mn/($0.39}. We model total listener hours
at 5.58bn and total RPM rates of $52. Our FY16 est. are slightly above on revenue, but
well above on EPS as we expect losses this year to improve in 2H16 as Pandora builds
up subs, but still see Pandora failing to gain much leverage from increased R&D
spending and S&M spend. We maintain our $9 PO, based on 1x our 2018 revenue
estimate, a discount to peers, but justified in our view as Pandora is likely to have a
difficult transition year as it builds it on-Demand service.

software had a conceptual flaw. If US intelligence services used it, the targets could figure out
that anyone visiting a site without an IP address was using TOR software to hide it. If TOR was
exclusive used by US intelligence services, the targets could further deduce that all the
anonymous visitors were avatars for American intelligence. It would be analogous to undercover
police using pink-color cars that civilians did not use.

To remedy this flaw, the US government in 2008 made TOR software open-source and freely
available to everyone in the world. It even provided funding for its promulgation with the State
Department, the National Science Foundation, and the Broadcasting Board of Governors
financing TOR’s core developer. The public rationale for this generosity was that TOR could
serve as a tool for, as the State Department called it, “democracy advocates in authoritarian
states. The result was TOR software became a tool of both intelligence services and their
adversaries.

As TOR software became widely used by adversaries (as well as common criminals), the NSA
sought to find vulnerabilities in it. “It should hardly be surprising that our intelligence agencies
seek ways to counteract targets’ that use TOR software to hide their communications, explained a
NSA spokesperson. The NSA’s adversaries also took an interest in identifying TOR users.

TOR software also took on a cult-like importance to hacktavists concerned with the US
government tracking their activities. An illuminating insight into the mind-set of the TOR
hacktavists is provided by Catherine A. Fitzpatrick in her 2013 book Privacy For Me Not For
Thee. She describes these hacktavists as largely “radical anarchists,” who believe “the state is all-
powerful, that law-enforcement is so strong that it will prevail anyway, and that they are a
persecuted minority.” As a refuge against the surveillance of the state, and in particular the NSA,
they not only hide attempt to their own identity nut use encryption to obscure their messages.
Their goal is free their movements from “of any interference from law-enforcement.” In this mind-
set, according to Fitzpatrick, “They believe government intelligence agencies will stop at nothing
to stop them from absolute encryption.”

TOR software was a means to defeat the NSA, but to be successfully there needed to be such a
proliferation of TOR servers that the NSA could not piece together IP addresses. The problem
was that in 2012 the TOR project, as they called it, was still a very tiny operation in 2012. It
employed less than 100 core developers who were located mainly in Germany, Iceland, Japan,
Estonia, and the United States. Its staff worked mainly out of a single room in Cambridge,
Massachusetts.

The guiding spirit behind the TOR movement was Jacob Appelbaum, a charismatic 28-year old
who had grown up in northern California. Like Snowden, he had dropped out of high school.
Appelbaum identified himself to his followers on the Internet as a “hacktivist” battling state
surveillance. For him, as with many in the hacktavist culture, the main enemy was the NSA. After
all, the NSA had a vast army of computer scientists working to unravel TOR software.

continuance of the 10:1 ratio through the last day tends to confirm that no
maintenance consumption is recovered alongside human depreciation. If it were,

age-wage profiles show that it would have to hold the same 10:1 ratio throughout.

Exhaust Pay

The present value and maximand truisms affirm that all including human
depreciation is expected to be recovered in positive cash flow. Positive cash flow is
transfer out plus exhaust. In human capital it is pay less plowback. Might some
human depreciation be realized in exhaust? I thought all was when | also thought
maintenance consumption was recovered in pay and work products. The boss and

Deliberate self-maiming exists and expresses it again. Just as Citizen Kane destroyed
his showcases because the fit was on him, some destroy their bodies. So long as the

destruction is intended and compos mentis, it counts as economic behavior.

Are there sunnier examples? What about voluntary unpaid vacations and voluntary
retirements? What if the boss and her secretary enter convents in mid-career?
These choices surrender human capital on the face of things because they surrender
literal future pay. But the psychic pay of leisure makes up for it. Otherwise we would

have stayed on the job track.

Then some human depreciation is exhaust. Call the psychic pay for it “exhaust pay”.
It seems mercifully small in the big picture. I tend to neglect it in modeling for that
reason, just as with invested consumption after full-time job entry. But I claimed
logical certitude as to expected recovery of human depreciation in pay. I’d better not
leave loopholes. There are none. Some of the pay is psychic, and some of the tastes

satisfied are not pretty.

book value for the balance sheet investments and accrued carry, and a discounted value
on the performance fee upside over a cycle (1.5x MOIC). Based on this method, we value
the fee related earnings at $14/unit, the balance sheet (principal investments and
accrued carry) at $6/unit, and the discounted value of future carry income and
investment income at $9/unit, which equates to a total value of $29, in line with our

•

• 
• • The Department of Justice lost its latest battle with Congress Thursday when it agreed to brief House 
Intelligence Committee members about a top-secret intelligence source that was part of the FBI's 
investigation of the Trump campaign. Even without official confirmation of that source's name, the news so 
far holds some stunning implications. 
Among them is that the Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation outright hid critical 
information from a congressional investigation. In a Thursday press conference, Speaker Paul Ryan bluntly 
noted that Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes's request for details on this secret source was wholly 
appropriate, completely within the scope of the committee's long-running FBI investigation, and 
something that probably should have been answered a while ago. Translation: The department knew full 
well it should have turned this material over to congressional investigators last year, but instead deliberately 
concealed it. 
House investigators nonetheless sniffed out a name, and Mr. Nunes in recent weeks issued a letter and a 
subpoena demanding more details. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's response was to double 
down—accusing the House of extortion and delivering a speech in which he claimed that declining to 
open the FBI's files to review is a constitutional duty. Justice asked the White House to back its 
stonewall. And it even began spinning that daddy of all superspook arguments—that revealing any detail 
about this particular asset could result in loss of human lives. 
This is desperation, and it strongly suggests that whatever is in these files is going to prove very 
uncomfortable to the FBI. 
The bureau already has some explaining to do. Thanks to the Washington Post's unnamed law-enforcement 
leakers, we know Mr. Nunes's request deals with a top secret intelligence source of the FBI and CIA, who 
is a U.S. citizen and who was involved in the Russia collusion probe. When government agencies refer to 
sources, they mean people who appear to be average citizens but use their profession or contacts to spy for 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 020819 
the agency. Ergo, we might take this to mean that the FBI secretly had a person on the payroll who used his 
or her non-FBI credentials to interact in some capacity with the Trump campaign. 
This would amount to spying, and it is hugely disconcerting. It would also be a major escalation from the 
electronic surveillance we already knew about, which was bad enough. Obama political appointees 
rampantly unmasked Trump campaign officials to monitor their conversations, while the FBI played dirty 
with its surveillance warrant against Carter Page, failing to tell the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court 
that its supporting information came from the Hillary Clinton campaign. Now we find it may have also been 
rolling out human intelligence, John Le Carr& style, to infiltrate the Trump campaign. 
Which would lead to another big question for the FBI: When? The bureau has been doggedly sticking with 
its story that a tip in July 2016 about the drunken ramblings of George Papadopoulos launched its 
counterintelligence probe. Still, the players in this affair—the FBI, former Director Jim Comey, the Steele 
dossier authors—have been suspiciously vague on the key moments leading up to that launch date. When 
precisely was the Steele dossier delivered to the FBI? When precisely did the Papadopoulos information 
come in? 
And to the point, when precisely was this human source operating? Because if it was prior to that infamous 
Papadopoulos tip, then the FBI isn't being straight. It would mean the bureau was spying on the Trump 
campaign prior to that moment. And that in turn would mean that the FBI had been spurred to act on the 
basis of something other than a junior campaign aide's loose lips. 
We also know that among the Justice Department's stated reasons for not complying with the Nunes 
subpoena was its worry that to do so might damage international relationships. This suggests the source 
may be overseas, have ties to foreign intelligence, or both. That's notable, given the highly suspicious role 
foreigners have played in this escapade. It was an Australian diplomat who reported the Papadopoulos 
conversation. Dossier author Christopher Steele is British, used to work for MI6, and retains ties to that spy 
agency as well as to a network of former spooks. It was a former British diplomat who tipped off Sen. John 
McCain to the dossier. How this top secret source fits into this puzzle could matter deeply. 
I believe I know the name of the informant, but my intelligence sources did not provide it to me and refuse to 
confirm it. It would therefore be irresponsible to publish it. But what is clear is that we've barely scratched 
the surface of the FBI's 2016 behavior, and the country will never get the straight story until President 
Trump moves to declassify everything possible. It's time to rip off the Band-Aid.

The FBI briefed House Intelligence Committee members about a top-secret intelligence source but did not 
allow them to see documents. An earlier version of this article misstated this.

the frenzy that ended in bad loans and meltdown.

Keating's book has an abiding message for Australia: in the transformed world we will
find ourselves increasingly on our own having to master our own destiny.

The job is to rediscover the productivity and savings agenda of the 1990s. Why did
Australia survive the 2008 financial crisis? Because of the flexibility of the economy,
Keating says. Flexibility which came from the reform of Australia's financial, product and
labour markets that began 25 years ago. This has given us one of the most flexible
economies in the world - arguably the most flexible. But further structural changes are
ahead of us.

He lists them. It is a mix of the new and old Keating agenda: a shift in resources to the
extractive industries; a lift in capital inflow driving a high current account deficit putting a
premium on savings; recognition that competitiveness will lie in the creativity of our
people as much as it does in our oil and gas; a renewed emphasis on the value of hi-
tech and education; and above all, a cultural change that integrates Australia more into
East Asia. Cultural transformation is the key for us, Keating says. He rates it as more
important than economic reform.

“There is less interest now in being part of East Asia than there was in the 1990s, he
laments.

Keating wants this idea revived. And he ties it to the republic arguing that to succeed in
Asia we must become a republic, a proposition Howard always dismissed.

On China, Keating is an optimist yet alive to the daunting economic challenge China now
confronts. What is happening in China knows no precedence in world economic history,
he says. Never before have 1.25 billion people dragged themselves from poverty at such
a pace. China is now half the GDP of the US and incomes have risen by a factor of 10.
He argues, however, that the origin of the 2008 financial crisis lies in the global
imbalances - China has built huge foreign exchange reserves by exporting too much and
America, in turn, is saving too little.

Keating says: China must shift the basis of growth from net exports and investment to
domestic consumption. Will they achieve this? Probably. Will there be strains along the
way? There have to be.

Unlike many Australian leaders, Keating is a Europhile. I think the European project is
the most significant project since the second world war, he says. But he sees two huge
blunders made in Europe.

From the euro's inception, Keating said it should constitute only Germany, France and
the Benelux nations, not the peripheral countries around the Mediterranean, and Greece
should never have been allowed in.

Why were the weaker economies given entry?

concerns, as well as the country’s longer-term challenges in finding its place in
more stable, peaceful Middle East. How, over time, we might manage to
extricate ourselves from the escalating violence with Hizbollah; reach a land-
for-peace deal with the enigmatic President Hafez al-Assad in Syria; and find
some form of coexistence with the Palestinians.

He also spoke about international politics. I remember one afternoon in the
summer of 1992 when he mentioned the then US presidential candidate Bill
Clinton. He’d met Clinton for the first time in Washington, after two days of
talks with President Bush at his summer home in Maine. Rabin was naturally
more comfortable dealing with Republicans. Almost all his experience in public
life — as a military officer, ambassador to Washington, Defense Minister and
Prime Minister — had coincided with Republican administrations. The irony was
that he would go on to forge a much closer relationship with President Clinton
than between any previous Israeli and US leader. But his first impression was
more skeptical. “Clearly, Clinton is very intelligent,” he said. “He is
surprisingly sharp politically for someone his age. But also, I fear, a little bit too
slick.”

We did not have long to focus on the lessons and implications of Tze’elim.
For weeks before the training accident, a crisis had been building in south
Lebanon, with a sharp escalation of the now-familiar mix of clashes inside our
“security zone” and cross-border rocket attacks. Hizbollah was now armed not
just with Katyushas but Saggers, American-made TOW anti-tank missiles and
an increasingly sophisticated array of roadside bombs. A combination of
Hizbollah attacks and “friendly fire” incidents or firearms accidents involving
our troops meant that Israelis were still dying in Lebanon a decade after the
formal end of the war. It was demoralizing for the Israeli public, for the soldiers
who we rotated into the security zone and for the government as well. The
difficulty was that it was also a situation that perfectly suited Hizbollah.

In late October, a Katyusha rocket had claimed the life of a 14-year-old boy
in the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona. Hizbollah escalated its rocket
fire in the days that followed, forcing tens of thousands of residents into their
shelters. Predictably, there was pressure from Likud politicians to hit back hard.

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023862.txt,"116 Teaching Minds

Never been to college but have been to high school? These are situa-
tions that happen to people. They usually assume that one is like the
other. While this assumption may not work out all that well, it is the
best a scriptless person can do in the situation.

A teacher, therefore, can take advantage of this human desire to
see unknown A as being like known B. People do this all the time.
They assume the girl they just met will behave like the last one they
went out with. They assume that their teacher will behave the way
their last teacher did. They assume that their new car works the way
the last one did. They do this with situations as well. What it means is
that people predict on the basis of experience and it is the job of the
teacher to help students understand which of their prior experiences
is most relevant when they are confused. Doing this is not so easy. But
it is possible and it is a proper area for a teacher or a course to focus on.

Here is the process. Students need to be asked what to do in a situ-
ation that is new to them. Their natural response would be to rely on
prior experience. The teacher’s job is to make that reliance explicit. To
ask students to say which experience they will rely on for help in the
new situation and ask why they think that that particular choice will
be helpful. To ask them to analyze the differences between the current
issue and the prior script and to predict where the prior script might
not work. To ask them to think of alternative scripts that might help.

What I have described here is the basic process of indexing cases
and matching cases, which is critical to thinking—especially original
thinking. No case is really exactly the same as one that came before.
We are used to partial matches when we use an old case to help with
a new one. What we are not used to is a discussion of why one match
was correct and why another was less helpful. Making case matching
a conscious process helps us understand something that we normally
do without much conscious thought. People need to learn to rely on
partial matches and they need to know how to determine which par-
tial match is most likely. I have referred to this process as case-based
reasoning in many prior publications.* But I have not spoken about
how to teach case-based reasoning. This is where post hoc discussion
is very important. An example of such a discussion can be found in
a book written by Harvard government professors® on the failure of
President Ford to choose the right cases to reason from in a crisis. Usu-
ally this kind of analysis is done as kind of an afterthought. However,
teaching people to do it actually is critical to teaching people to pre-
dict properly.

to-1 shot to emerge as the champion), the Cleveland Cavaliers’ first ever National Basketball
Association championship and, of course, the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series for the first
time since 1908! All unlikely. But they happened.

Last but not least, in our own political backyard, we witnessed Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S.
presidential election last month. Also unlikely. We all know markets do not like uncertainty.
However, sentiment can shift quickly if fundamentals are not negatively affected, and what was
previously determined to be “unlikely” turns to enthusiasm as to what could be.

We expect business, consumer and investor confidence to continue to head
higher well into 2017, with most of the newly expected growth to come in 2018,
which should underpin equities for most of the year.

CHRISTOPHER HY ZY
CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BANK OF AMERICA GLOBAL WEALTH AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

Why this expansion can continue

Business cycles typically last between five and seven years before fundamentals deteriorate,
usually due to a policy error of some sort. This can produce a recession and/or a bear market, which
tend to correct the excesses that have been built up and kick-start a new cycle. Bull markets and
cycles do not die of old age—there needs to be a fundamental catalyst that emerges and pushes the
trends back the other way.

We are entering our ninth year in the current business cycle, despite all of the complexities and
concerns that have come and gone since the financial crisis.. In fact, this cycle could have extended
another few years along the same path, given the secular stagnation that prevailed. This era needed
ultra-accommodative central bank monetary policy just to keep things stable and plodding along
this far into the cycle. It also needed corporations willing to manage their earnings to the penny in a
below trend growth world that offered little pricing power. And finally, this cycle needed U.S. and
emerging market consumers to continue to switch from deleveraging to spending as their balance
sheets and incomes improved.

A return of “animal spirits

This dynamic could have continued for a bit, but monetary policy has become tired. Negative
interest rates have become a headwind, not a tailwind, in our view. And, just like sports fans,
investors need a catalyst to break from the past. Visible positive catalysts tend to turn into
improved sentiment and confidence. Through the years, economists have called this “animal
spirits.”

Animal spirits begin as hope, turn into enthusiasm, and ultimately need visible action to keep the
spirited momentum going. After all, economics is a behavioral science. It is our view that we are
breaking from the era of secular stagnation and heading into fiscal reflation. This new era is likely
to have its fits and starts and will not be in a straight line. It should also include different stages and
speeds from various economic regions globally. Furthermore, it should contain some “unlikely”
outcomes. With any cycle, we will have to take the good (higher nominal growth) with the potential

A few years later, after it became unmistakably clear that Faurisson was consciously lending his
name to all sorts of anti-Semitic and neo-Nazi groups, Chomsky repeated his character reference:

“T see no anti-Semitic implications in denial of the existence of gas chambers, or even
denial of the Holocaust. Nor would there be anti-Semitic implications, per se, in the claim
that the Holocaust (whether one believes it took place or not) is being exploited, viciously
so, by apologists for Israeli repression and violence. I see no hint of anti-Semitic
implications in Faurisson’s work...” (emphasis added)

[Add Mearsheimer]

When this statement was quoted in the Boston Globe, I wrote the following letter to the editor:

“While some may regard Chomsky as an eminent linguist, he does not understand the most
obvious meaning of words in context. To fail to see any “hint of anti-Semitic
implications” in Faurisson’s collective condemnation of the Jewish people as liars, is to be
either a fool or a knave.

Chomsky’s actions in defending the substance of Faurisson’s bigoted remarks against valid
charges of anti-Semitism—as distinguished from defending Fuarisson’s right to publish
such pernicious drivel—disqualify Chomsky from being considered an honorable defender
of the “underdog.” The victims of the Holocaust, not its defenders or deniers, are the
underdogs.”

Chomsky responded by arguing that Faurisson was an anti-Zionist rather than an anti-Semite,
because he denounced “Zionist lies.”

Following this exchange, I challenged Chomsky to a public debate on the issue of whether it is
anti-Semitic or anti-Jewish to deny the Holocaust. This was his answer: “It is so obvious that
there is no point in debating it because nobody believes there in an anti-Semitic connotation to the
denial of the Holocaust” (emphasis added).

One is left to speculate about Chomsky’s motives—political and psychological—for becoming so
embroiled in the substantive defense of the writings of a neo-Nazi Holocaust denier.

The civil liberties-free speech rationale does not work for Chomsky: civil libertarians who defend
the free speech of neo-Nazis do not get into bed with them by legitimating their false “findings” as
having been based on “extensive historical research,” and by defending them—on the
merits—against well-documented charges of anti-Semitism. Moreover, providing a forward for a
book is joining with the author and publisher in an effort to sell the book. It is intended not
merely to leave the marketplace of ideas open. It is intended to influence the marketplace
substantively in favor of the author’s ideas. This is not the defense of free speech. It is the
promotion of Holocaust denial.

Several years after my encounter with Chomsky, I was asked to defend a neo-Nazi Holocaust
denier named Matthew Hale, who was the head of an anti-Semitic group that called itself “The

consider having the 49percent of phaidon merged into artspance and have Richard buy artspace. re-do bank

will, make suydam executor , with Barry, and john as back up. pay 1 million a year for executor role. get rid
of Judy Black trust, deal with gifts and their tax returns, . review amounts to kids at fixed ages. put more
protections in for Alex and Victoria. , distribute some money to kids let them make decisions. , decide art
division with children in attendance . have fire drill done on estate. fill out estate returns as if you and Debra
died today, choose advisers - rick bronstein said the only 1040 he ever filled out was his own. ( this is brads
chosen advisor??!) Halperin has a conflict that should be addressed., Debra should enter a tenants in common

visa issue sooner rather than later. we can talk about Rowen request re Athene , 2 billion in taxes on
transaction. ?!

the facts as i see them

in June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout., then after weeks of thinking about
the issue ( which I fully understand ) . the payout was unilaterally changed . 5m woudl be reserved for the
future ? . and out of the remaining 15m ,? i would receive only 5. ( note : I'm confident that both the debt , and
the artspace investment will also lead to a write off of another 30 m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were
surprised when I said that i require most people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured that I
will be properly compensated for my work when strategies that I devise are implemented . you may recall that
you appeared offended and said  are you suggesting that i would go back on my word  I said no , of course
not ! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that when amounts get large, people tend to get
unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay ,.

From day zero a 50 - 60 million price was attached as the fair price of the transaction just completed .
though this amount was already substantially less thanour agreed and negotiated formula. - I was
never told that this was out of range. in fact, alternative methods of payment. plane -in-kind etc, were
discussed (ie keeping the 30m portion of fee outstanding till March ) ,J provided as requested a
detailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that 1 was given access to. ( Phaidon was not
forthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections. I was then told that Alans involvement warranted a
discount. Even in the best of light , though it is beyond question that not one-,not -one time in three
years has he ever proposed a unique idea. (including the new tenant in common idea,) and lets say he made
a contribution to the plan andeven that it was 50 %. though no one could posit such a large amount unless they
were wearing a brightly colored clown suit. , the price of doing the deal was known . It had both sent in
writing and spoken about on the phone numerous times ,_ a detailed execution plan was provided . then and
only then after all was laid out for the group I was told that after a number of conversations with brad karp
that only 20m would be paid , (and even that was more than originally contemplated ) for both transactions . I
feel It was remarkably unfair. Did brad even know of our prior agreement.? I called him and he said he was
never told.?, I would ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it would be helpful. . I would like to
send him this email, with your consent of course. Ifthe transactions were never consummated , i would not be
owed a dime, however , the price was known up front. , the detailed step by step plan was followed and
overseen by me, the price that had been requested before the transaction was begun, and had Iready heavily
discounted, out of friendship, from our agreement . I believe the decision re paying only 20 m has frankly

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019894.txt,"Donald Trump’s marriage was perplexing to almost everybody around him—or it was,
anyway, for those without private jets and many homes. He and Melania spent relatively
little time together. They could go days at a time without contact, even when they were
both in Trump Tower. Often she did not know where he was, or take much notice of that
fact. Her husband moved between residences as he would move between rooms. Along
with knowing little about his whereabouts, she knew little about his business, and took at
best modest interest in it. An absentee father for his first four children, Trump was even
more absent for his fifth, Barron, his son with Melania. Now on his third marriage, he told
friends he thought he had finally perfected the art: live and let live—‘Do your own thing.”

He was a notorious womanizer, and during the campaign became possibly the world’s
most famous masher. While nobody would ever say Trump was sensitive when it came to
women, he had many views about how to get along with them, including a theory he
discussed with friends about how the more years between an older man and a younger
woman, the less the younger woman took an older man’s cheating personally.

Still, the notion that this was a marriage in name only was far from true. He spoke of
Melania frequently when she wasn’t there. He admired her looks—often, awkwardly for
her, in the presence of others. She was, he told people proudly and without irony, a
“trophy wife.” And while he may not have quite shared his life with her, he gladly shared
the spoils of it. “A happy wife is a happy life,” he said, echoing a popular rich-man truism.

He also sought Melania’s approval. (He sought the approval of all the women around
him, who were wise to give it.) In 2014, when he first seriously began to consider running
for president, Melania was one of the few who thought it was possible he could win. It
was a punch line for his daughter, Ivanka, who had carefully distanced herself from the
campaign. With a never-too-hidden distaste for her stepmother, Ivanka would say to
friends: All you have to know about Melania is that she thinks if he runs he’ll certainly
win.

But the prospect of her husband’s actually becoming president was, for Melania, a
horrifying one. She believed it would destroy her carefully sheltered life—one sheltered,
not inconsiderably, from the extended Trump family—which was almost entirely focused
on her young son.

Don’t put the cart before the horse, her amused husband said, even as he spent every
day on the campaign trail, dominating the news. But her terror and torment mounted.

There was a whisper campaign about her, cruel and comical in its insinuations, going
on in Manhattan, which friends told her about. Her modeling career was under close
scrutiny. In Slovenia, where she grew up, a celebrity magazine, Suzy, put the rumors about
her into print after Trump got the nomination. Then, with a sickening taste of what might
be ahead, the Daily Mail blew the story across the world.

The New York Post got its hands on outtakes from a nude photo shoot that Melania had

waiting and watching to see if I was turning into someone that I needed to shoot.

Fortunately, Wiseman found partners who were open to exploring S&M with him, and
went on to write extensively about safety and consent and communication within S&M.
Trying to communicate in an egalitarian way is arguably the most complicated part of
any S&M encounter; as Scootah told me, There are certainly elements that could
potentially unbalance a relationship in my favor. I'm a big reasonably strong guy. I do
usually make more money than my partners. I also have this whole sense of position in
the local S&M community. I mostly just try to be aware of those things. I try to be very
careful about not taking advantage of that and negotiate clearly and not pressure people.”

There are lots of ways to do clear negotiation, including asking open-ended questions
before any S&M actually happens: What are you interested in? Could you go into that
more? There's also a huge emphasis on talking through the S&M encounter afterwards,
as part of the post-S&M processing we call aftercare. As another gent who goes by Noir
said: It really helped me to have a few great, feminist S&M partners. Having that echo
of ‘it's OK, I want this,' as well as the honest feedback when I do wrong really helped
shape how I experience S&M, and with who. It's meant I learned how better to read and
grasp the people in my, er, grasp.”

Noir also noted, I strive to use dominance and submission as a tool for helping my
partners become stronger, in ways that also feed my S&M preferences. For example, I
tend to form long-term interests with women who want a 'safe space’ to extend and
explore their ability to be sluts, with all that can imply. But in the process, we also
explore how becoming more confident in one's sexuality also can reflect into everyday
life. Also, just coming to spaces in the S&M community can be a goldmine of
information. All a dominant man has to do is read, listen, open up and understand. One
thing I learned was that my fears about reinforcing our messed-up society were shared by
women into kink... but also that my ways of approaching the topic, as 'oh, we're so
controlled by society!' were themselves pushing too much agency out of women's
choices. There's a balance there that we guys who identify as both feminist and kinky
have to respect, and that can come from listening to feminist women struggle with these
issues, themselves.

The alternative sexuality advocate Pepper Mint (who has his own blog) told me that in
terms of putting gender on his experiences, I am a bit genderqueer, and I personally
experience dominance with either a feminine or masculine vibe from moment to moment.
Certain activities -- like punching -- feel masculine, while others -- like whipping --
feminine in the moment. Also, I switch, meaning that I don't always take the dominant
role. Strangely, my most clearly masculine S&M activity is masochism. I always feel
very manly while taking pain. I don't think I can clearly explain why these things have
attached to gender in my head, though presumably I'm being affected by cultural tropes to
some extent.”

The consensus in general was that dominance, whether masculine or feminine, is
something that happens in an encounter... not outside it. As Pepper put it, New guys
often want to play hard or do hardcore things, and will often boast and swagger. Kinky
women almost always recognize this as dangerous bullshit. Learn to chill out and not take

which may do damage in the hands of irresponsible militarists.”°° He remained
ambivalent about the transformative power of new technologies, indulging in neither the
boundless hype nor the digital utopianism of later pundits.

“Progress imposes not only new possibilities for the future but new restrictions,”
he wrote, in Human Use. He was concerned about human-made restrictions as well as
technological ones, especially Cold War restrictions that threatened the flow of
information so critical to cybernetic systems: “Under the impetus of Senator [Joseph]
McCarthy and his imitators, the blind and excessive classification of military
information” was driving political leaders in the United States to adopt a “secretive frame
of mind paralleled in history only in the Venice of the Renaissance.” Wiener, echoing
many outspoken veterans of the Manhattan Project, argued that the postwar obsession
with secrecy—especially around nuclear weapons—stemmed from a misunderstanding of
the scientific process. The only genuine secret about the production of nuclear weapons,
he wrote, was whether such bombs could be built. Once that secret had been revealed,
with the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, no amount of state-imposed secrecy
would stop others from puzzling through chains of reasoning like those the Manhattan
Project researchers had followed. As Wiener memorably put it, “There is no Maginot
Line of the brain.”

To drive this point home, Wiener borrowed Shannon’s fresh ideas about
information theory. In 1948, Shannon, a mathematician and engineer working at Bell
Labs, had published a pair of lengthy articles in the Be// System Technical Journal.
Introducing the new work to a broad readership in 1949, mathematician Warren Weaver
explained that in Shannon’s formulation, “the word information...is used in a special
sense that must not be confused with its ordinary usage. In particular, information must
not be confused with meaning.”?! Linguists and poets might be concerned about the
“semantic” aspects of communication, Weaver continued, but not engineers like
Shannon. Rather, “this word ‘information’ in communication theory relates not so much
to what you do say, as to what you could say.” In Shannon’s now-famous formulation,
the information content of a string of symbols was given by the logarithm of the number
of possible symbols from which a given string was chosen. Shannon’s key insight was
that the information of a message was just like the entropy of a gas: a measure of the
system’s disorder.

Wiener borrowed this insight when composing Human Use. If information was
like entropy, then it could not be conserved—or contained. Physicists in the 19th century
had demonstrated that the total energy of a physical system must always remain the same,
a perfect balance between the start and the end of a process. Not so for entropy, which
would inexorably increase over time, an imperative that came to be known as the second
law of thermodynamics. From that stark distinction—energy is conserved, whereas
entropy must grow—followed enormous cosmic consequences. Time must flow forward;

mice knockouts (the ablation of specific proteins though interference with their
nucleotide-mediated protein biosynthesis), for example, the production of animals
missing a subunit of their hippocampal glutamate receptors associated with the loss
of some memory functions, conclude the memorial mechanism to be a specific
cellular region, such as hippocampal CA3 cells. Technology advances but continues
to support a primitive philosophic animism of named brain parts which pop science
icons like the late Francis Crick called “The Amazing Hypothesis.” He and his fellow
brain philosophers implicate brain mechanisms such as the amygdaloidal nucleus
man who can emotionally color even affectually neutral information that is
transported through him. Imaging data showing amygdala man lighting up is used to
tell us that circulating sensory information through the differentially behaving
amygdaloid nucleus is used for fight or flight interpretive significance. Emotionally
expressive human faces light up inferior parietal cortex. The lowa University
Professors, the husband and wife Damasios, have located even the criminal
psychopath man in specific locations in the brain. As we have argued, perhaps ad
nausem, using multimillion-dollar imaging and molecular biological technology and
no new thoughts that weren’t around during the era of the 19th Century’s
neuroanatomists, specific brain regions continue to gain implicative properties like
the task-specialized gods of the Roman and Greek pantheons. Crick implied that

God is a brain part.

At the same time, those of us that have been in the brain business for a
while, recall skyscraper window washers, standing steady, high up on rope lashed
planks, suffering from congenital absence of the cerebellum, the supposed sine qua
non brain part supporting motor coordination and balance in humans. More
generally, there is much evidence that if young enough and willing to work, many of
the functions of missing parts of the brain can be taken on remarkably well by other
brain parts thought not to be involved in these functions at all. In addition, since
evidence of neuronal responding to loud noise or bright light perturbation can be
found almost everywhere in the hyper-connected human brain, because anticipation

and brain time inversions make before and after indicate little about human

unfair labor practice charge is filed
alleging failure to post the notice, “‘the
Regional Director will make reasonable
efforts to persuade the respondent
employer to post the * * * notice
expeditiously,” and that “[i]f the
employer does so, the Board expects
that there will rarely be a need for
further administrative proceedings.” 75
FR 80419.

Numerous comments assert that
finding the failure to post the notice to
be an unfair labor practice is too harsh
a remedy, especially for small
employers that are more likely to be
excusably unaware of the rule.146 As
just stated, in practice it should almost
never be necessary for proceedings to
reach that point. For the few employers
that may ultimately be found to have
violated Section 8(a)(1) by failing to post
the notice of employee rights, the only
certain consequences will be an order to
cease and desist and that the notice and
a remedial notice be posted; those
remedies do not strike the Board as
severe.

Michigan Health & Hospital
Association urges that an employer be
allowed to correct an initial failure to
post the notice without further
consequences; Fireside Distributors, Inc.
agrees and asks that technical violations
of the rule not be subject to a finding of
a violation. The Heritage Foundation
backs the same approach for inadvertent
failures to post. The Board disagrees. To
repeat, the Board anticipates that most
employers that inadvertently fail to post
the notice will do so on being informed
of the posting requirement, and that in
those circumstances further proceedings
will rarely be required. However, the
Board believes that this matter is best
handled through the General Counsel’s
traditional exercise of prosecutorial
discretion in accordance with the
directions given here.

California Chamber and NCAE
contend that the Board should specify
the “‘reasonable efforts’ a Regional
Director will make to persuade an
employer to post the notice when a
charge alleging a failure to post has been
filed. They propose that the rule be
amended to state that the Board will
send the employer at least two mailed
letters, with the notice enclosed,
requesting that the employer post the
notice within a specified period of time,
preferably 30 days. They also assert that
the Board must specify the
circumstances in which additional
proceedings will be appropriate. The
Heritage Foundation urges that
§ 104.212(a) be modified to state that if

146 See, e.g., comments of St Mar Enterprises, Inc.
and National Federation of Independent Business.

an employer promptly posts the notice,
“there will be no further administrative
proceedings, unless the Board has
information giving the Board reason to
believe that the preceding failure to do
so was intentional.” The Board rejects
these suggestions because they would
create unnecessary obstacles to effective
enforcement of the notice requirement.
That requirement is straightforward, and
compliance should be a simple matter.
The Board believes that the General
Counsel should have discretion to
address particular cases of non-
compliance efficiently and
appropriately, depending upon the
circumstances.

B, Tolling the Section 10{(b) Statute of
Limitations

NLRA Section 10(b) provides in part
that ‘‘no complaint shall issue based
upon any unfair labor practice occurring
more than six months prior to the filing
of the charge with the Board|[.]’” 29
U.S.C. 160(b). However, as the Board
stated in the NPRM, the 6-month filing
period does not begin to run until the
charging party has actual or constructive
notice of the allegedly unlawful
conduct. See, e.g., john Morrell & Co.,
304 NLRB 896, 899 (1991), review
denied 998 F.2d 7 (D.C. Cir. 1993)
(table). 75 FR 80414. This makes
intuitive sense, because it would be
unfair to expect charges to be filed
before the charging party could
reasonably have known that the law was
violated. Similar concerns for fairness
justify tolling the statute of limitations
where an employee, although aware of
the conduct in question, is excusably
unaware that the conduct is unlawful
because mandatory notice was not given
to the employee. The Board found that
widespread ignorance of NLRA rights
justified requiring notice to be posted.
The Board cited the observation of the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit in a case involving the failure to
post the notice required under the
ADEA, that “‘[t]he [ADEA] posting
requirement was undoubtedly created
because Congress recognized that the
very persons protected by the Act might
be unaware of its existence.”’ Bonham v.
Dresser Industries, 569 F.2d 187, 193
(1977), cert. denied 439 U.S. 821 (1978).
Accordingly, the Board proposed that
tolling the 10(b) period for filing unfair
labor practice charges might be
appropriate where the required notice
has not been posted. 75 FR 80414. For
the reasons discussed below, the Board
acheres to that view.

Section 10(b) is a statute of
limitations, and statutes of limitations
are presumed to include equitable
tolling whenever the statute is silent or

ambiguous on the issue. Irwin v. Dep’t
Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 94-96
(1990); Zipes v. Trans World Airlines,
Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 392-98 (1982); see
Young v. United States, 535 U.S. 43, 49
(2002) (‘It is hornbook law that
limitations periods are customarily
subject to equitable tolling, unless
tolling would be inconsistent with the
text of the relevant statute.” (quotations
and citations omitted)); Hallstrom v.
Tillamook County, 493 U.S. 20, 27
(1989) (“The running of such statutes is
traditionally subject to equitable
tolling.’’); Honda v. Clark, 386 U.S. 484,
501 (1967); Glus v. Brooklyn E.D.
Terminal, 359 U.S. 231, 232-33 (1959)
(equitable tolling of statutes of
limitations is “[d]eeply rooted in our
jurisprudence’); Holmberg v.
Armbrecht, 327 U.S. 392, 396-97 (1946)
(equitable tolling is “read into every
federal statute of limitation’’).

In Zipes, the Supreme Court held that
the timeliness provision of Title VII’s
charge-filing requirement was ‘‘subject
to waiver, estoppel and equitable
tolling.” 455 U.S. at 392-98. The
Supreme Court expressly analogized to
the NLRA, and stated that Section10(b)
was not jurisdictional: “[T]he time
requirement for filing an unfair labor
practice charge under the National
Labor Relations Act operates as a statute
of limitations subject to recognized
equitable doctrines and not as a
restriction of the jurisdiction of the
National Labor Relations Board.”’ Id. at
n.11. Zipes strongly supports the
proposed rule. The analogy between
Title VI and the NLRA is well
established, and neither the holding of
Zipes regarding Title VII nor Zipes’
characterization of 10(b) has ever been
called into doubt.

Notices of employment rights are
intended, in part, to advise employees
of the kinds of conduct that may violate
their rights so that they may seek
appropriate remedies when violations
occur. Failure to post required notices
deprives employees of both the
knowledge of their rights and of the
availability of avenues of redress.
Accordingly, a substantial majority of
the courts of appeals—including the
First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth,
Seventh, Eighth, and Eleventh
Circuits—have adopted the doctrine that
the failure to post required employment
law notices may result in equitable
tolling of the statute of limitations.

° Poetry in America’s many initiatives to reach Middle and High School teachers and their
students are taking root. Our first online course for Middle and High School Teachers, Poetry of
the City, will launch this Spring with the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Companion
materials to this course will be made available for free on PBS LearningMedia. This course is
designed to meet the needs of English Language Arts and Social Studies teachers in the US and
internationally.

° We are eager to begin production of The Poetry of Earth, Sea, and Sky. Designed, too, for
Middle and High School teachers, The Poetry of Earth, Sea, and Sky will draw English Language
Arts instruction into dialogue with science, and will include extraordinary footage of the natural
world, conversations with poets, scholars, and scientists as well as footage shot in class and in the
field with great teachers.

° A recent partnership with Greenwich Country Day School and the Success Academy Network
of charter schools will provide a base for the production of a new collection of classroom-ready
educational material on The Poetry of Art, Sport, and Play. This collection will include discussions
on poems filmed everywhere from sports fields to Broadway theaters, and will feature dancers,
athletes, fashion designers, and more.

° With a growing archive of footage capturing teachers and students reading American poems,
we are eager to expand our reach and move into America’s schools, disseminating, testing,
and learning from teachers and students using our materials. We hope to be able to begin work
evaluating the impact of poetry on literacy levels and character development and, eventually, to
produce a full suite of materials that foster character development along with intellectual growth.

Working closely with such partners as The Nantucket Project, Nautilus Magazine, The Aspen Ideas
Festival, and The Big Think, and, of course, HarvardX, Harvard’s provider of free open online
courses, we are continuing to create rich educational media on poetry for adult learners and
lifelong learners. These materials include short form videos such as this one on Robert Pinsky’s
“Shirt” (as featured in The New Yorker), and, this spring, the sixth module of the free seven-part
Poetry in America MOOC, which has registrants in over 150 countries.

Growing rapidly, and outpacing our current staff and infrastructure, Poetry in America has a
fundraising goal this year of 2.5 million dollars to fund its expanding group of projects. We’ve taken
a big step, hiring the design agency Threespot to help us develop our web presence. Our
website— to launch early 2016— will eventually serve as an online hub for our TV show and
educational projects. We hope you'll join us then for a virtual launch!

Finally, Jeffrey, you have been such a wonderful supporter of my Poetry in America project. The
Leon Black gift changed everything for me last year. It paid salaries for staff | desperately needed to
complete projects (detail below), but first and foremost, it gave me leverage, enabling me to set
down a Solid Harvard base for my activities by giving the school something to point to: this public
humanities project among the list of projects the Dean supports. The money did it: as soon as they
heard about the gift, they took my project more seriously. Because of that gift, the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences, which is space-stingy, found and rewired a studio space for me to house my video
production operation and team. That gift woke up the Deans to the importance of Harvard's role in
producing the highest quality humanities content for the WORLD, and not just for Harvard students.
My main employee has half of her salary paid with these funds, and the foundation of our collection
for PBS LearningMedia is being made with this support. This gift represented one of the most
consequential shifts of the last year, allowing me create content and launch projects this year that

Epstein until after it was signed,” wrote Assistant U.S. Attorney Dexter Lee.

Said Hakes, the former federal prosecutor: “I have never heard of a case where
federal prosecutors consult with a defense attorney before they send out standard
victim notification letters. To negotiate what the letters would say and whether
they would be sent at all suggest that the victims’ rights were violated multiple

times.”

Starr’s aggressive advocacy for Epstein against allegations of improper sexual
behavior was in stark contrast to the path he took investigating then-President
Clinton. The Starr Report, the summary of his findings in the Whitewater
investigation, which started as a probe of a land deal gone sour and veered into
an investigation of sexual misconduct, savaged the president for his involvement
with White House intern Monica Lewinsky and was the basis for impeachment.

Starr himself would face criticism in 2016 — he stepped down as president of
Baylor University amid allegations that he and other university officials
mishandled sexual assault allegations brought by female students against
members of the school’s football team.

The Herald reached out to Starr, through certified letter and through a spokesman
for his current law firm, the Lanier Firm, but did not receive a response for this
story.

Palm Beach police detective Recarey, one of the most highly decorated officers on
the Palm Beach Police Department, called the Epstein case the most troubling of
his 23-year career.

“Some of the victims were — and still are — afraid of Epstein,” he said as part of
a series of interviews with the Herald earlier this year.

Privately, Reiter and Recarey said, they held onto a hope that Epstein would be
brought to trial someday, but they said that that notion had faded.

“T always hoped that the plea would be thrown out and that these teenage girls,
who were labeled as prostitutes by prosecutors, would get to finally shed that label
and see him go to prison where he belongs,”’ Recarey said.

high.

The dollar will continue to smile. Previously, we made the suggestion that
the US dollar is on the right side of the Dollar Smile against the majors, but
it is on the left side of the Dollar Smile against the EM

currencies. Reaganomics-Lite should be positive for the dollar, even if the
US’ twin deficits could widen. ‘America First’ means that there will be a
bifurcation in economic prosperity, that economic strength in the US will no
longer translate, with the same elasticities as before, into prosperity in many
parts of EM. (1) The dollar has begun a consolidation phase this week. But
my guess is that it will be temporary and shallow, partly because the data
(ISM and NFPRs) will be sufficiently strong to justify another Fed rate hike
on December 14. The weekly claims data remain extraordinarily strong,
while the second derivatives in the data in much of EM have ceased to be
positive. (2) Further advances in the dollar, however, will of course depend
on the policy announcements and delivery by the Trump Administration, as
well as an apparent lack of an economic strategy in other countries. (3)
Yield differentials have helped the dollar advance vis-a-vis the JPY and the
EUR. However, I should note that the EMU economies are not doing that
badly, though credit demand remains weak. PMI remains well above 50 and
inflation has bounced away from zero. The main factor — other than yield
differentials - weighing on the EUR 1s the risk that we will see more political
uncertainty in Europe. (4) I came across an editorial arguing that Mr
Trump’s protectionist policies would hurt the dollar’s international
standing. While this may be a popular view — that the US, as a savings
deficit nation, needs a globalised world to finance its external balance —I
contest this conclusion. I think it will be extremely difficult for the
international status of the dollar to be supplanted, even with Mr Trump as
the President. The dollar losing its hegemonic status has been a popular
thesis by many academics over the last twenty years — precisely the period
when the dollar’s international and reserve currency status has risen. In
many ways, the sturdiness of the dollar’s global status has surprised some
people, because globalisation is supposed to lead to a multi-polar world
where the US loses its dominance. That is certainly true for the real
economy, but exactly the opposite has happened for the dollar. This is a
point I’ve tried hard to make over the years, that financial globalisation is
uni-polar, even though trade globalisation is multi-polar. Look at how the
rise in the dollar is hurting, disproportionately, the high-yield and EM
currencies. Further, which currencies might replace the dollar? The EUR
itself is still in an existential crisis; nothing needs to be said about the JPY;
China could not even dare opening up its capital account. In fact, Beijing
has just issued even more ‘strict controls’ on overseas investment, after
experiencing some USD207 billion in outflows in Q3 2016. Just because
President Trump’s prospective trade policy may not be politically correct

For most of our species’ history, our ancestors were barely people. This was not due to
any inadequacy in their brains. On the contrary, even before the emergence of our
anatomically modern human sub-species, they were making things like clothes and
campfires, using knowledge that was not in their genes. It was created in their brains by
thinking, and preserved by individuals in each generation imitating their elders.
Moreover, this must have been knowledge in the sense of understanding, because it is
impossible to imitate novel complex behaviors like those without understanding what the
component behaviors are for.”°

Such knowledgeable imitation depends on successfully guessing explanations,
whether verbal or not, of what the other person is trying to achieve and how each of his
actions contributes to that—for instance, when he cuts a groove in some wood, gathers
dry kindling to put in it, and so on.

The complex cultural knowledge that this form of imitation permitted must have
been extraordinarily useful. It drove rapid evolution of anatomical changes, such as
increased memory capacity and more gracile (less robust) skeletons, appropriate to an
ever more technology-dependent lifestyle. No nonhuman ape today has this ability to
imitate novel complex behaviors. Nor does any present-day artificial intelligence. But
our pre-sapiens ancestors did.

Any ability based on guessing must include means of correcting one’s guesses,
since most guesses will be wrong at first. (There are always many more ways of being
wrong than right.) Bayesian updating is inadequate, because it cannot generate novel
guesses about the purpose of an action, only fine-tune—or, at best, choose among—
existing ones. Creativity is needed. As the philosopher Karl Popper explained, creative
criticism, interleaved with creative conjecture, is how humans learn one another’s
behaviors, including language, and extract meaning from one another’s utterances.”’

6 “ Aping” (imitating certain behaviors without understanding) uses inborn hacks such as the mirror-neuron
system. But behaviors imitated that way are drastically limited in complexity. See Richard Byrne,
“Imitation as Behaviour Parsing,” Phil. Trans. R. Soc., B 358:1431, 529-36 (2003).

Epstein have been public for some time, this is the first time the detail about her employment
at Mar-a-Lago has been included.

Last summer, the Trump-Epstein connection made headlines when Trump was slated to win
the Republican nomination, and just before the election, a woman came forward alleging that
Trump raped her when she was 13 at one of Epstein’s parties — only to drop suit a few days
later.

In 2015, Trump lawyers denied claims of the then-candidate’s involvement with Epstein by
saying their only relation was that Epstein was “one of thousands of people who has visited
Mar-a-Lago”. Those claims that fly in the face of a 2002 New York Magazine interview in
which Trump claimed to have known Epstein for 15 years.

“He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and

many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life,”
Trump told reporters.

Such cases establish a worrying precedent of Chinese intrusion into American
academic life. The message from China to US universities is clear: Do not transgress the
political no-go zones of the Chinese Communist Party or government, or you will pay
a price. Sometimes the pressure is overt; other times it is more subtle and indirect, but
no less alarming. Some American faculty members report troubling conversations with
university administrators who continue to view Chinese students as such a lucrative
revenue stream that it should not be endangered by “needlessly irritating Chinese
authorities.”

Censorship and Self-Censorship

The final category of troubling Chinese influence on American campuses involves the
vexing issue of self-censorship among faculty and students in Chinese studies.*° In a
much-quoted essay, Perry Link described censorship within China as the use of vague
threats to induce academics, writers, and others to self-limit what they say; he called
this “the anaconda in the chandelier” syndrome.*! More recently, the phenomenon

has begun to loom over scholars working outside China, and the Chinese government
has started deploying a variety of techniques to also encourage self-censorship beyond
China’s borders, including in the United States. In some cases, this syndrome has led to
outright self-censorship of academic work. To cite some of the most egregious examples:

e Denial of visas to qualified scholars and students seeking access to China for
research or training purposes. The State Department estimates that fifteen to
twenty individuals are on an outright “black list,” while scores of others appear
to be on a “gray” list, where denials are less absolute and sometimes temporary
or limited only to certain categories of visa. But being cast into the “gray” status
helps create exactly the kind of uncertainty about what behavior might lead to
visa denial, thus inducing self-censorship in the hopes of not offending anyone
further, much less turning one’s status from “gray” to “black.” In other words,
the power to withhold or deny access through the issuance of visas affords the
Chinese government a full spectrum of powerful control mechanisms over
scholars.

e Denial of access to interviewees, archives, libraries, and research institutes, even
when visas are granted.

e Restriction of visiting scholar status for American researchers to a few institutes
under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and
some universities. Other think tanks and research institutes do not permit foreign
resident researchers. At the same time, it should be noted, Chinese researchers
from a wide variety of institutes are free to regularly come to US universities and
think tanks for short- and long-term stays.

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022759.txt,"He befriends Bill Clinton in his new after-office life.

And that’s quite the fatal pairing.

The post-Monica Clinton, now having pardoned the on-the-lam
financier Marc Rich—at this point, before his own rehabilitation, Clinton
really is the world’s ultimate sleaze ball—is suddenly being ferried around
in the jet of... who exactly?

The New York Post is the first to take formal media note of the
Clinton-Epstein connection, hinting at a sex and money bromance. (“I
suppose travel with Clinton changed the arc of my life,” Epstein tells me.
“There were, I knew, lots of obvious reasons not to do it, but having the
ability to spend 100 hours with a former president just doesn’t happen to
many people.”)

The instinctively private Epstein is not just increasingly exposed, but
clearly curious about the nature of exposure.

I met Epstein around this time. Epstein had become a more and more
active backer of advanced scientific research and in 2002 he was taking a
small group of scientists out to the TED conference in Monterey. The TED
organizers invited various other TED participants, including me, to join the
flight. A small group assembled at the private plane terminal, most of us
unfamiliar with our benefactor, and as we headed in the direction of the
discrete private plans we were gently pointed to our ride: Epstein’s 727.

It is some thoroughly updated drawing room set-up, all of us
nervously ensconced in this luxury plane, waiting for our unknown host to
arrive—and soon he does, tanned, relaxed, with wide open smile,
accompanied by three young women.

It would be unlikely, outside of a men’s magazine fantasy of the luxe
life, that you could locate this in reality. Epstein’s attentions, taking time
with each of his passengers, seemed impossible to account for. The quiet of
the plane, engineered into acoustic perfection, seemed spooky. Epstein’s
three companions were witty, poised, helpful as well as powerfully
alluring—as though stewardesses of bygone times.

(One more thing about this trip: Google founders, Larry Page and
Sergey Brin, with their company still in its infancy, came out to see the
plane on the Monterey tarmac and, with a few other Googlers, literally ran
whopping from one end of the plan to the other. Then they described for
Epstein, in what I can not now remember as a put on or entrepreneurial
brainstorm, a brand extension in which they would market a line of Google
bras with the Os as convenient cups. In fact, the name Google, they said,
was invented out of the belief that men would focus on a word with two Os
in it.)

entitled to deference under the analysis
set forth in Chevron U.S.A, Inc. v.
Natural Resources Defense Council,
Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984). Under
Chevron, where Congress has not
“directly addressed the precise question
at issue,”’ id. at 842-843, that
rulemaking authority may be used in
order “‘to fill any gap left, implicitly or
explicitly, by Congress.” Id. at 843.

Even assuming that the absence of an
explicit posting requirement in the
NLRA is not interpreted as clear
expression of Congressional intent, the
majority fails to persuade that Congress
delegated authority in Section 6 of the
NLRA for the Board to fill a putative
statutory gap by promulgating a rule
that an employer commits an unfair
labor practice by failing to affirmative
notify its employees of their rights
under the NLRA. As the Supreme Court
has explained, ‘the ultimate question is
whether Congress would have intended,
and expected, courts to treat [the
regulation] as within, or outside, its
delegation to the agency of ‘gap-filling’
authority.” Long Island Care at Home,
Ltd. v. Coke, 551 U.S. 158, 173 (2007).

There is no doubt that there are many
gaps and ambiguities in the NLRA that
Congress intended for the Board to
address, using its labor expertise, either
through adjudication or rulemaking.
However, the existence of ambiguity in
a statute is not enough per se to warrant
deference to the agency’s interpretation
of its authority in every respect. The
ambiguity must be such as to make it
appear that Congress either explicitly or
implicitly delegated authority to cure
that ambiguity. Am. Bar Ass’n v. FTC,
430 F.3d 457, 469 (D.C. Cir. 2005);
Motion Picture Ass’n of America, Inc. v.
FCC, 309 F. 3d 796, 801 (D.C. Cir. 2002)
(“MPAA ’’) (“agency’s interpretation of
[a] statute is not entitled to deference
absent a delegation of authority from
Congress to regulate in the areas at
issue.”’).

Thus, even when an administrative
agency seeks to address what it believes
is a serious interpretive problem, the
Supreme Court has said that the agency
“may not exercise its authority ‘in a
manner that is inconsistent with the
administrative structure that Congress
enacted into law.’’’ FDA v. Brown &
Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S.
120, 125(2000) (quoting ETSI Pipeline
Project v. Missouri, 484 U.S. 495,
517(1988)). Further, the statute at issue
must be considered as a “symmetrical
and coherent regulatory scheme.”’
Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S. 561,
569, 115 S.Ct. 1061, 131 L.Ed.2d 1
(1995). In our case, the exercise of
rulemaking authority under Section 6 is
not self-effectuating; it must be shown

to relate reasonably to some other
provision as part of the overall statutory
scheme contemplated by Congress.175

Nothing in the text or the regulatory
structure of the NLRA suggests that the
Board has the authority to promulgate
the notice-posting rule at issue in order
to address a gap in the statutory scheme
for resolving questions concerning
representation through Section 9, or in
preventing, through Sections 8 and 10,
specifically enumerated unfair labor
practices that adversely affect
employees’ Section 7 rights. On the
contrary, it is well-established that the
Board lacks independent authority to
initiate or to solicit the initiation of
representation and unfair labor practice
proceedings, and Section 10(a) limits
the Board’s powers to preventing only
the unfair labor practices listed in
Section 8 of the Act. Yet the majority
asserts that it may exceed these
limitations by requiring employers to
post a notice of employee rights and
illustrative unfair labor practices at all
times, regardless of whether a petition
had been filed or an employer has been
found to have committed an unfair labor
practice.

The majority’s reliance on a
combination of Section 7, 8, and 10
warrants special mention. They reason
that an employer interferes with Section
7 rights in general, and thereby violates
Section 8(a)(1), by failing to give
continuous notice to employees of those
rights. It may be a truism that an
employee must be aware of his rights in
order to exercise them, but it does not
follow that it is the employer under our
statutory scheme who must provide
enlightenment or else incur liability for
violating those rights. The new unfair
labor practice created by the rule bears
no reasonable relation to any unfair
labor practice in the NLRA’s pre-
existing enforcement scheme developed
over seven decades.!77 It certainly bears

176 See, e.g., Mourning v. Family Publications
Service, Inc., 411 U.S. 356, (1973) Unlike here, the
Federal Reserve Board easily met this standard in
Mourning when issuing a disclosure regulation
under the Truth in Lending Act, even though that
Act did not explicitly require lenders to make such
disclosures. In sustaining the regulation, the Court
ound the regulation to be within the Federal
Reserve’s rulemaking authority and, in light of the
egislative history, the disclosure requirement was
not contrary to the statute. ‘The crucial distinction,
* * * [was that] the disclosure requirement was in
act enforced through the statute’s pre-existing
remedial scheme and in a manner consistent with
it.” Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., 535
U.S. 81, 94 (2002).

177 The Senate report on the Wagner bill stressed
that unfair labor practices were “‘strictly limited to
those enumerated in section 8. This is made clear
by paragraph 8 of section 2, which provides that
‘The term ‘unfair labor practice’ means unfair labor
practice listed in Section 8,” and by Section 10(a)
empowering the Board to prevent any unfair labor

no relation to the few examples the
majority can muster in Board precedent.
The only instance with even a passing
resemblance to the rights notice-posting
requirement here is the requirement that
a union give notice of Beck 178 and
General Motors 17° rights. However, the
failure to give such a notice is not per
se unlawful. It becomes an unfair labor
practice only when a union, without
giving notice, takes the affirmative
action of seeking to obligate an
employee to pay fees and dues under a
union-security clause.18° Beyond that, a
union has no general obligation to give
employees notice of their Beck and
General Motors rights; much less does it
violate the NLRA by failing to do so. By
contrast, the rule promulgated today
imposes a continuing obligation on
employers to post notice of employees’
general rights and, even absent any
affirmative act involving those rights,
makes the failure to maintain such
notice unlawful.181

Unlike my colleagues, I find that the
Supreme Court’s opinion in Local 357,
Teamsters v. NLRB, 365 U.S. 667 (1961),
speaks directly to this point. In that
case, the Board found a hiring hall
agreement unlawfully discriminatory
per se because, even though it included
an express anti-discrimination

practice “listed in Section 8.” Thus, “[nJeither the
National Labor Relations Board nor the courts are
given any blanket authority to prohibit whatever
labor practices that in their judgment are deemed
to be unfair.” S. Rep. No. 573, 74th Cong., 1st Sess.
17 (1935) at 8-9 reprinted in Legislative History of
the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, Vol. Hat
2307-2308 (1985).

178 Communications Workers v. Beck, 487 U.S.

179 NLRB v. General Motors, 373 U.S. 734 (1963).

180 California Saw & Knife Works, 320 NLRB 224,

181 None of the FMLA cases cited by the majority
support finding that a failure to post a general
notice of employee rights under the NLRA is
unlawful. In Bachelder, the Ninth Circuit actually
ound “unavailing” the employer’s argument that it
had satisfied all its specific FMLA notice
obligations because it had complied with the
FMLA’s general posting rule. Id. at 1127, In. 5.
Rather, the court found that because the employer
ailed to “notify” an employee which of the four
FMLA’s “leave year” calculation methods it had
chosen, the employer “interfered” with that
employee’s rights and, therefore, improperly used
he employee’s FMLA covered absences as a
“negative factor’ when taking the affirmative
adverse action of discharging her.

Similarly, in neither Greenwell v. Charles
Machine Works, Inc., 2011 WL 1458565 (W.D.Okla.,
2011); Smith v. Westchester County, 769 F. Supp 2d
448 (S.D.N.Y. 2011), was the FMLA general posting
requirement at issue. Smith did not involve a notice
issue and Greenwell involved the employer’s failure
to comply with a different notification obligation
under the FMLA.

In any event, as previously stated, FMLA
expressly provides that employers give notice to
employees of rights thereunder and expressly
provides for sanctions if notice is not given. The
NLRA does neither.

13.4.2 Knowledge Representation via Cell Assemblies

Hopfield nets and their ilk play a dual role: as computational algorithms, and as conceptual
models of brain function. In CogPrime they are used as inspiration for slightly different, artificial
economics based computational algorithms; but their hypothesized relevance to brain function
is nevertheless of interest in a CogPrime context, as it gives some hints about the potential
connection between low-level neural net mechanics and higher-level cognitive dynamics.

Hopfield nets lead naturally to a hypothesis about neural knowledge representation, which
holds that a distinct mental concept is represented in the brain as either:

1. a set of “cell assemblies”, where each assembly is a network of neurons that are interlinked
in such a way as to fire in a (perhaps nonlinearly) synchronized manner

2. adistinct temporal activation pattern, which may occur in any one (or more) of a particular
set of cell assemblies

For instance, this hypothesis is perfectly coherent if one interprets a “mental concept” as a
SMEPH (defined in Chapter 14) ConceptNode, i.e. a fuzzy set of perceptual stimuli to which
the organism systematically reacts in different ways. Also, although we will focus mainly on
declarative knowledge here, we note that the same basic representational ideas can be applied
to procedural and episodic knowledge: these may be hypothesized to correspond to temporal
activation patterns as characterized above.

In the biology literature, perhaps the best-articulated modern theories championing the cell
assembly view are those of Gunther Palm [Pal&82, HAGO7] and Susan Greenfield [SF05, CSGO7].
Palm focuses on the dynamics of the formation and interaction assemblies of cortical columns.
Greenfield argues that each concept has a core cell assembly, and that when the concept rises
to the focus of attention, it recruits a number of other neurons beyond its core characteristic
assembly into a “transient ensemble.”!

It’s worth noting that there may be multiple redundant assemblies representing the same
concept — and potentially recruiting similar transient assemblies when highly activated. The
importance of repeated, slightly varied copies of the same subnetwork has been emphasized by
Edelman [Ede93] among other neural theorists.

1 The larger an ensemble is, she suggests, the more vivid it is as a conscious experience; an hypothesis that
accords well with the hypothesis made in [Goe06b] that a more informationally intense pattern corresponds to
a more intensely conscious quale — but we don’t need to digress extensively onto matters of consciousness for
the present purposes.

were made when Epstein was in Palm Beach.

They obtained dozens of message pads from his home that read like a who’s who
of famous people, including magician David Copperfield and Donald Trump, an

indication of Epstein’s vast circle of influential friends. There were also messages
from girls, and their phone numbers matched those of many of the girls Recarey

had interviewed, Recarey said. They read: “Courtney called, she can come at 4,
or “Tanya can’t come at 7 p.m. tomorrow because she has soccer practice.”

They also found naked photographs of underage girls in Epstein’s closet, Recarey
said.

There were also witnesses: Two of Epstein’s butlers gave Recarey sworn
interviews, confirming that young girls had been coming and going at the house.
One of the butlers, Alfredo Rodriguez, told Recarey that when he was tasked with
cleaning up the master bath after Epstein’s sessions with the girls, he often
discovered sex toys. Once, he accidentally stumbled on a high school girl, whom
he identified, sleeping naked in Epstein’s spa, he testified in a 2009 court
deposition.

Rodriguez said he was given the job of paying the girls, telling Recarey that he
was “a human ATM machine” because he was ordered by Epstein to keep $2,000
on him at all times. He was also assigned to buy the girls gifts. Rodriguez gave
Recarey copies of pages from a book that Epstein and his staff kept with the
names and phone numbers for many of the Palm Beach County girls, Recarey
said.

Rodriguez, however, held onto the bulk of Epstein’s “little black book,” and in
November 2009 tried to sell it for $50,000 to an undercover FBI agent posing as
a victim’s lawyer. He was arrested and sentenced in 2012 to federal prison, and
died three years later following an illness. The book — listing personal phone
numbers for a cavalcade of Epstein’s powerful friends and celebrities — eventually
became public as part of a civil lawsuit. It listed more than 100 female names
and phone numbers under the headings “massage’’ in every city where Epstein
had homes.

Life

The mosquito first detects my scent from thirty feet away. It triggers its pursuit function,
which consists of the simplest possible rules. First, move in a random direction. If the
scent increases, continue moving in that direction. If the scent decreases, move in the
opposite direction. If the scent is lost, move sideways until a scent is picked up again.
Repeat until contact with the target is achieved.

The plume of my scent is densest next to me and disperses as it spreads, an
invisible fog of particles exuded from my skin that moves like smoke with the wind. The
closer to my skin, the higher the particle density; the farther away, the lower. This
decrease 1s called a gradient, which describes any gradual transition from one level to
another one—as opposed to a “step function,” which describes a discrete change.

Once the mosquito follows this gradient to its source using its simple algorithm, it
lands on my skin, which it senses with the heat detectors in its feet, which are attuned to
another gradient—temperature. It then pushes its needle-shaped proboscis through the
surface, where a third set of sensors in the tip detect yet another gradient, that of blood
density. This flexible needle wriggles around under my skin until the scent of blood
steers it to a capillary, which it punctures. Then my blood begins to flow into the
mosquito. Mission accomplished. Ouch.

What seems like the powerful radar of insects in the dark, with blood-seeking
intelligence inexplicable for such tiny brains, is actually just a sensitive nose with almost
no intelligence at all. Mosquitoes are closer to plants that follow the sun than to guided
missiles. Yet by applying this simple “follow your nose” rule quite literally, they can
travel through a house to find you, slip through cracks in a screen door, even zero in on
the tiny strip of skin you left exposed between hat and shirt collar. It’s just a random
walk, combined with flexible wings and legs that let the insect bounce off obstacles, and
an instinct to descend a chemical gradient.

But “gradient descent” is much more than bug navigation. Look around you and
you'll find it everywhere, from the most basic physical rules of the universe to the most
advanced artificial intelligence.

The Universe

We live in a world of countless gradients, from light and heat to gravity and chemical
trails (chemtrails!). Water flows along a gravity gradient downhill, and your body lives
on chemical solutions flowing across cell membranes from high concentration to

low. Every action in the universe 1s driven by some gradient drive, from the movement
of the planets around gravity gradients to the joining of atoms along electric-charge
gradients to form molecules. Our own urges, such as hunger and sleepiness, are driven
by electro-chemical gradients in our bodies. And our brain’s functions, the electrical
signals moving along ion channels in the synapses between our neurons, are simply
atoms and electrons flowing “downhill” along yet more electrical and chemical gradients.

I have personally witnessed accusations of topping from the bottom or service top”
being used to hurt people who were just trying to communicate, or arrange a relationship
that they liked. For example: I thought you were a submissive. Why are you asking me
to tie you up? Stop topping from the bottom! I'm the dominant partner, I make the
decisions!

An important facet of consent is trying to create a pressure-free environment, so that all
partners feel comfortable talking about what they want. Sometimes, it can be very hard to
create that environment, because pressure isn't always easy to see or understand -- but if
we want maximum consent power, then we have to do our best. One way to create a
pressure-free environment is to be careful about phrases like topping from the bottom”

FEMINISM:

I wrote this post in mid-2011. Perhaps you can tell that I was in the depths of my
obsession with pickup artists at the time... those guys talk about inherent female
submission” ad nauseam. Not all pickup artists are evil and misogynist, but the ones who

Inherent Female Submission: The Wrong Question

I get a certain question occasionally, from straight dudes who've had a number of sexual
partners. It goes something like this:

All the women I've slept with liked pain. They asked me to hurt them or to dominate them
in bed. I did it, and enjoyed it; I loved how much it turned them on... it turned them on a
lot. But I keep thinking about it now. Why are all women into being submissive and/or
masochistic in bed? What does that mean?

They ask me this question in vaguely worried tones. Sometimes they say things like, It's
really creepy. It is obvious that these dudes are rather concerned about this Terrible
Truth.

sixty years monitored government communications. It had also kept
track of adversaries’ missile telemetry, submarine movements, and
nuclear proliferation.

The Snowden breach was not without precedent at the NSA.
There had been two Russian spies at the NSA during the Cold
War, Jack Dunlap and David Sheldon Boone, who took a limited
number of documents, but no one since the end of the Cold War
is known to have taken a single NSA classified document. Now an
insider had removed a vast number of the NSA’s documents. Many
of these documents were classified TS/SCI—“Top Secret, Sensitive
Compartmented Information”—which, as NSA secrets went, were
deemed the gold standard of espionage because they revealed the
sources used in communications intelligence. Whatever the assess-
ment of Snowden’s motivation, the single question that needed to be
answered was, what happened to these stolen files?

Recall the huge disparity between the number of documents that
the NSA calculated that Snowden compromised and the number of
documents he is known to have handed over to journalists in Hong

© Kong on a thumb drive. When the House and Senate Intelligence ©
Committees asked the NSA how many documents Snowden took,
the NSA could not come up with a definitive number despite having
employed a world-class team of experts to reconstruct the crime. The
NSA could say that 1.7 million documents had been selected in two
dozen NSA computers during Snowden’s brief tenure at Booz Allen
in 2013, including documents from the Department of Defense, the
NSA, and the CIA. Of these “touched” documents, some 1.3 million
had been copied and moved to another computer.

There was evidence that Snowden had used preprogrammed spi-
ders to find and index the documents. He had said that he took the
job at Booz Allen to get access to data that he copied. So as far as the
NSA was concerned, of course, the 1.3 million documents he cop-
ied and moved were considered compromised. On top of this haul,
Snowden had copied files while working at Dell in 2012. As a sys-
tem administrator there, he could download data without leaving a
digital trail. As previously mentioned, more than half the documents
actually published in newspapers had been taken during Snowden’s
time at Dell.

sciences, Eric Kandel studied the neural mechanisms of habituation as a primitive,
accessible and fundamental example of learning, the association of a nonresponse
to a usually evocative stimulus, in Aplysia californica. The sea snails learned not to
respond to a local irritation with a gill-withdrawal response when exposed to it many
times. They learned to stop paying attention to the perturbation. The background
noise appears to disappear after a little time in the Mall. Though his exploration of
its synaptic mechanisms involved the neural circuit of the gill-withdrawal reflex in the
marine snail, its generality and human relevance is well established. Hundreds of
papers can be found reporting the results of studies of habituation in normal
humans under all kinds of circumstances as well as in psychopathological
conditions. That it samples something both fundamental and persistent is suggested
by studies in children by one of Kandel’s students, Michael Lewis. He found that the
rate of habituation of a startle response to a bright light in one-year-old human
infants predicted success in many kinds of learning and other cognitive functions
when the children were tested again at the age of four. Pavlov’s experiments
studied habituation of the classically conditioned salivary response to meat powder-
coupled bell sounds in dogs in which the bell was followed by nothing, not only led
to inhibition of the salivary response with unreinforced trial repetition but
generalization of the inhibitory state such that dogs were observed to freeze in
motionless catatonic states for hours. In the language of our statistical measures,
the fixation of the dog’s behavior would manifest minimal entropy in the form of H7 =
Hu = 0 and the lowest complexity values for AC and srs. Entheogenic agents like
LSD or mescaline inhibit the process of habituation and fixation, maximizing the
entropy of behavioral measures, H7, Hy > 1 and high complexity values for AC and
srs.

Mark Geyer and David Braff, Professors at the University of California in La
Jolla and Michael Davis, a Professor at Yale’s School of Medicine, found that
entheogenic agents, such as mescaline and LSD, as well as naturally occurring
indoleamines, such as DMT, which occurs naturally in human brain, prevented

habituation of startle responding in mammals. Each sound repetition was treated as

Schulte Research Report, ED 164: Slides 
1. Ping An & CICC are the 2 H shares that operate in the middle of Alibaba, Tencent, Lufax. 
A. The chart below represents a deep dive we did on the new world of Chinese banking. Companies 
like Zhong An, WeBank and Lufax will grow dramatically and will take advantage of (as well as 
support) the massive worlds of Alibaba and Tencent. Together, Alibaba and Tencent have market cap 
of $500 bn. Popping up in many of these areas of overlap are Ping An and CICC. They are 
strategically placed to make great strides in China. This is slowly being recognized in the case of Ping 
AN (See Page 8 of attached PPT). Ping An's market cap is $97 bn. It is connected to Zhong An.. It 
owns 44% of Lufax. And some if its management were the very ones that started WeBank. It is 
perfectly positioned for the coming boom in new banking. It has the best combined ROA and ROE 
globally and its P/E of 10x is trading on a 50% discount to the global averages. Why is Ping An 
trading at a discount to AIA? BUY PING AN -- SELL AIA.. 
B. The other company which has the best return on capital of any broker dealer -- and is also  
positioned nicely for the coming boom in the new era of banking in China -- is CICC. CICC and CDH 
(a CICC breakaway) both invested in Zhong An and Lufax. CICC has vision and a proven track record. 
Yet it has been a laggard. This is a top pick for H shares for China in 2017. The other bank with great 
vision in this area is CCB, which has invested in Ant Financial. BUY H shares CCB and CICC. (See 
attached PPT for portfolios and China fintech details). 
C. IPOs in 2017. I think Zhong An will be a surprise for 2017 in the Hong Kong market. Its market 
cap is expected to be $10 bn and it has interesting potential in so many areas of insurance. It 
remains an insurance company whose marginal cost of a new customer is zero. It has a talented 
team of 900 engineers and has new Al and blockchain divisions. It is rolling out an impressive array 
of products including corporate solutions for insurance and investment plans. Lufax CEO Greg Gibb 
made a big splash at the Finnovasia (Schulte Research co-sponsored it) in Hong Kong last month. 
The company is a diversified financial conglomerate akin to Schwab meets etrade and Fidelity --
only 25 years ago. It needs an IPO north of $25 bn in order for the private equity partners to make 
money. Lastly, Ant Financial will come to the market for a $60 bn IPO in 2017 -- also in Hong Kong. 
This is a mothership company that goes to the heart of China's system. Its early investors are CIC, 
CDB, CCB, China Life and other vital organs of the system. It will not be allowed to fail. There are 
some questions about whether to own this through Alibaba, since Alibaba will own 33% of Ant post 
IPO. I'm in this camp. Buy Alibaba on this pullback. (See attached PPT for the full China Fintech 
Report). 
2. Koch Industries saturates both the offices of Trump as well as Pence. Mega bullish for Russia, oil 
and gas companies. Mega bearish for alternative energy. 
A. The Koch Brothers are not just two grumpy men -- they are a political party. Koch Industries is the 
second biggest private company in the US after Cargill. They operate public and secretive political 
entities in 32 states and dole out more than $500 million each political cycle to various entities in the 
strongest places. The political entities employ more than 1,200 people and the amount of donations 
available to right wing causes varies dramatically but is as high as $750 million per cycle. It is the 
third largest party in the US after the Democratic and Republican party. It controls the Libre Alliance, 
Americans for Prosperity, Freedom Partners, Institute for Energy Research, American Energy Alliance 
and Concerned Veterans. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026043 
B. What do they do with their money? They support right wing Republican candidates for all 
organizations -- attorneys general, Senate, House and state political figures. This is where it gets 
interesting. Freedom Partners is thought of as the Koch bank. Guess who ran this? Marc Short. It 
controls about $250 mn in funds for political activity. Guess who employed Marc Short as chief of 
staff? Indiana Governor Mike Pence. Guess who then employed him as chief of staff? President-elect 
Trump. Matt Lloyd is in charge of communications and strategy for VP-elect Pence -- he came from 
Koch Industries. Governor Pence was a frequent attendee of the secretive semi-annual meetings of 
the Koch Brothers. Guess who raised more than $100 million for Freedom Partners? Don McGahn. 
Guess who is the new White House Counsel for President-elect Trump? Don McGahn. (McGahn was 
embroiled in the Tom Delay scandal in the 2000s). Guess who had two companies which had Koch 
Brothers as investors and whose chief of staff (Chenowith) came from the Koch world? The new CIA-
designate chief Mike Pompeo. (Pompeo's Kansas campaign received a $900,000 donation from Koch). 
Guess who gave $1 mn to Americans for Prosperity? Education secretary designate Betsy Devos. 
Guess who has written the strategy paper for the Department of Energy transition? Tom Pyle -- He is 
affiliated with the Koch Industries Office of federal Affairs and the Institute for Energy Research. 
Guess who was caught up in a Koch Industries scandal for a petrochemical port project (with a Koch 
affiliated Messr. Henneberry)? Governor Nikki Haley who is UN Ambassador designate. 
C. Advisors are ALL Koch-related. Here is where it gets fun. Former campaign advisor Corey 
Lewandowski came from KochLand. Rebekah Mercer is part of Koch and and gave $2.5 mn to 
Freedom Partners. Kellyanne Conway has connections to Pence from way back and is connected to 
Steve Bannon through the Center for National Policy. Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie 
came from Citizens United. The Director of Coalitions for Trump is named Alan Cobb -- he came from 
Americans for Prosperity. Daren Se!nick is a transition advisor and he came from Concerned 
Veterans. Others on the Trump team who came from Kochland include Stuart Jolly, Eli Miller, Scott 
Hagerstrom and Matt Ciepielowski. 
3. BUY the hell out of Russia -- Exxon Rex is a cabinet trifecta for Koch Brothers. 
A. And there's Exxon Rex. Any contribution from Exxon received money from Koch -- and vice versa. 
Rex Tillerson is worth $151 million and is leaving Exxon next year. He seems to have accepted 
secretary of state position. He inked a deal worth $300 billion in oil and gas exploration in 2012. (For 
that, he received the highest civilian honour bestowed by Russia). This will be a boom for Koch 
Industries as the sanctions against Russia are lifted. (Thank you Uncle Vlad for interfering in the 
elections). This will be a boom for Russia -- for equities, FX and bonds. It is clear that sanctions 
against Russia will be lifted regardless of whether Russia interfered in the elections. (Clinton made 
this a campaign issue and still lost!). 
B. Anyone who thinks this will be reversed by Greenpeace or other green organization is kidding  
themselves. The Senate and House is Republican. Majority parties control all committees so they 
control the agenda. The agenda is set. These guys are geniuses with the news cycle. And the vast 
array of think tanks controlled by the Koch Brothers (most of them) allows them to control the news 
cycle as well as the opinion pages of newspapers. The web on control on public opinion from the 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026044 
Koch Brothers reaches every newspaper through a large array of think tanks like the AEI and Cato 
Institute, not to mention the vast array of Koch think tanks. 
C. If you don't like this, tough luck. Life is not fair. This is not going to be reversed. Think of it as 
watching a science experiment. Bush lost the popular vote to Gore in 2001 and completely reversed 
policies on tax, environment, Middle East, energy, fracking, birth control, and LGBT issues. Trump, 
Pence, Bannon and Koch will make a deal which will be a hybrid of religious right on moral issues and 
zero intrusion from government in commerce. Republicans already control the Senate, the House, a 
majority of governorships as well as a majority of attorneys general. It will be very hard to reverse 
this. And if Trump can deliver jobs to the midwest red states, more senate seats will turn red. Tom 
Pyle's list of things to for the Department of Energy's transition team is expressly designed to do this. 
This includes new oil and gas leasing projects, more fracking, more coal, more LNG projects -- and a 
green light for both the Keystone and Dakota pipelines. The working paper reneges on the Paris pact, 
the Clean Power Plan and the carbon tax. And it is expressly a climate change denial policy. States 
like North Dakota, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Iowa, Texas, Louisiana, West Virginia, Kansas and 
others will come to life again.. Most of these states have small populations but each gets a governor 
and two senators.

Importance: High 
Hi Jeff 
I thought this might interest you 
Edward Jay Epstein 
July ii, 2W / 
Polities and law 
The 2016 presidential campaign was marked by three disclosure operations, all of which appear to 
have had a single author. Oppo research is the euphemism commonly used in elections for such 
operations. The mechanism is fairly simple: dirt is obtained from wherever it can be found to 
discredit an opponent. It is then leaked, usually either anonymously or on background, to targeted 
media channels. What makes the 2016 campaign particularly interesting from a counterintelligence 
perspective is not that both sides had their own disclosure operations, but that both sides were 
offered the dirt for them by a common source: Russian intelligence. 
As we now know from the emails of Donald Trump Jr., a thinly veiled intermediary, Natalya 
Veselnitskaya, offered the Trump campaign documents that putatively would show that Hillary 
Clinton had received illegal donations from Russian financiers; in the event, no such documents 
were proffered. But it is a reasonable assumption that Veselnitskaya could not have made such an 
offer, especially in a meeting attended by three other Russians, unless the move was approved by 
the FSB, the Russian security service. 
A second disclosure operation, this one involving supporters of the Clinton campaign, was more 
layered. The proximate intermediary was Fusion GPS, a research firm used by the law firm Baker 
Hostetler, and the secondary cut-out was the British firm Orbis, co-founded by former MI-6 
officer Christopher Steele. We know something about this sub-contractor from the depositions 
Steele gave in defending a libel suit in London. According to Steele, Fusion GPS not only had him 
prepare the so-called dossier on Trump but also directed Steele to leak it to specified reporters 
at Mother Jones, Yahoo, the New York Times, the Washington Post, The New Yorker, and CNN. In 
some cases, Steele was directed to brief the selected journalists personally. The dirt in these leaks 
relied heavily on information supplied by two Russian government sources: Source A, whom Steele 
calls a senior Russian Foreign Ministry figure; and Source B, a former top-level intelligence 
officer still active in the Kremlin. Sources A and B provided information supposedly exposing a 
long-time Russian FSB operation to get compromising information that could be used to control 
Trump. The idea that two Russian intelligence sources would reveal a long-time Kremlin-backed 
FSB operation bears further examination. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025548 
Michael More11, a former acting CIA director, casts light on the sourcing of the dirt in the Steele 
dossier. I had two questions when I first read [the dossier], More11 said in an NBC interview. 
One was, how did Chris [Steele] talk to these sources? I have subsequently learned that he used 
intermediaries. I asked myself, why did these guys provide this information, what was their 
motivation? And I subsequently learned that he paid them. That the intermediaries paid the sources 
and the intermediaries got the money from Chris. 
Paying ex-FSB officers for sensitive information? As Steele is no doubt aware, there is no such 
thing as an ex-FSB officer. All Russian intelligence officers, whether currently or formerly 
employed, if in Russia, operate under the same tough security regime. The selling of secret 
information by them is espionage, pure and simple. Selling it to someone connected to an adversary 
intelligence service greatly compounds the crime. Sources A and B (through their intermediaries) 
knew that they were dealing with an ex-MI-6 man who could use their betrayal of secrets against 
them. The only safe way for A and B to provide the requested dirt would be to clear it with the 
security regime at the FSB. This precaution, a required step in such exchanges, would mean that the 
dirt in the dossier, whether true or false, was curated by the FSB and spoon-fed to Steele. If so, the 
FSB was the surreptitious provider of this part of the Steele dossier. 
The third disclosure operation involved stolen emails from the DNC bearing on the unfair treatment 
by Democratic Party officials of Bernie Sanders, which were posted on the DC Leaks website. 
President Obama identified the Kremlin as the author of this operation, saying These data theft 
and disclosure activities could only have been directed by the highest levels of the Russian 
government. If so, as in the previous cases, the FSB would have curated the dirt. To be sure, oppo-
research operatives, because of their singular focus on getting usable slime, are highly vulnerable to 
shady offers, but why would Russia so blatantly feed the slime to all sides in a campaign? 
The United States has a wide array of tools for monitoring Russian intelligence, including the 
world's most sophisticated sensors for intercepting signals, but discovering the Kremlin's motives 
remains an elusive enterprise because, unlike in a scientific inquiry, one cannot fully trust the 
observable data. While a scientist can safely assume that the microbes he observes through the lens 
of a microscope are not employing guile to mislead him, an intelligence analyst cannot make 
similar assumptions about the content of intercepted communications from Russia. If one assumes 
that the Russians do not know that the channel is being monitored—an assumption which, 
following the defection of Edward Snowden to Russia, is hard to make prudently—then the 
intelligence gleaned from that channel can reveal the Kremlin's activities and motive. If, however, 
it is understood that the Russians know that a channel is being monitored, the information conveyed 
over it can be considered a disclosure operation. 
If, for example, a Mafia family finds out that the FBI is tapping its telephone lines, it can use those 
lines to burn its rivals. The Kremlin can also use a knowntapped phone line to its advantage. 
Consider, for example, the tapped phone of Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. On December 1, 
2016, Kislyak went to Trump Tower to meet Jared Kushner and Michael Flynn. According to 
Kushner's version of that meeting, Kislyak suggested that Russian generals could supply 
information about Russian military operations in Syria on the condition that the Trump transition 
team provide a secure line in the transition office. Of course, as Kislyak likely knew, transition 
teams don't have secure lines to Moscow. Kushner responded by asking if the Russian embassy 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 025549 
could supply such a secure line. Kislyak then used an open phone line at his embassy to relay 
Kushner's response to his foreign ministry in Moscow. It is inconceivable that Kislyak did not 
know that the call would be monitored by the FBI, since the FBI had routinely listened in on these 
lines for the past 68 years, or that his discussion of Kushner's request would set off alarm bells in 
the intelligence community. 
If Kislyak had wanted to hide this exchange from U.S. intelligence, he could have easily sent it 
under diplomatic cover directly to Moscow, used a secure line, or relayed it in a coded fashion. By 
communicating the message en clair, or in plaintext, Kislyak skillfully exposed Kushner's 
incredibly stupid response, which he himself had provoked, to stoke distrust about the incoming 
president within the U.S. intelligence community. Nor was this the only mistrust Kislyak 
cultivated: the conversations on the monitored phone led to the firing of National Security Advisor 
Michael Flynn, and conversations that Kislyak had with Attorney General Jeff Sessions led to 
Sessions's recusing himself from the Russian investigation, which has now driven a wedge between 
President Trump and one of his most effective and popular cabinet members. 
Kislyak's resume indicates that he is a well-regarded and competent player in the game of nations: 
he has served as Second Secretary of the Soviet UN mission in New York, First Secretary of the 
Soviet Embassy in Washington, Deputy Director of the Soviet Department of International 
Organizations in Moscow, Permanent Russian representative to NATO in Brussels, Deputy Foreign 
Minister, and Ambassador to the United States. Nothing in his 37-year career, either during or after 
the Cold War, suggests that his moves are not aligned with Kremlin strategy. 
But when it comes to the various disclosures and interventions surrounding the 2016 election, what 
exactly was that strategy? 
In a report issued on January 6, 2017, entitled Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in 
Recent U.S. Elections, the U.S. intelligence community concluded, based both on its sources and 
its analysis of stories on the Russian-controlled network RT, that Putin wanted to hurt Clinton, help 
Trump, and discredit the American election. These may well have been motives of the Russian 
president, but the narrowly focused assessment fails to explain, or even take into account, Kislyak's 
post-election ensnarement of Kushner, or the discrediting dirt against Trump. If Putin had really 
wanted to help Trump win the election, why did Russian sources provide damaging dirt to Steele, 
which could have cost Trump the election? Why did Kislyak provide the FBI with information, via 
a known tapped line, that could (and did) compromise key members of Trump's administration? 
A wider focus can be found, of all places, in Oliver Stone's revealing, if fawning, four-hour 
interview with Putin, in which the Russian dictator makes clear that he views American hegemony, 
including America's standing and respect in the international community, as a threat that Russia 
must counter. One way to undermine America's standing is to provide disclosures that can be used 
by its own political factions, and the media, to sow distrust in America's reliability as a democracy 
founded on transparency. Putin tells the truth when he says that it doesn't matter particularly to 
Russia whether Clinton or Trump won the election: his goal was to install doubt in the legitimacy 
of the process, regardless of how it turned out.

Snowden, the Man and the Theft, published by Alfred A. Knopf in January.

before he left Hong Kong in June 2013. Why would Appelbaum keep
it secret for more than four months? The same pressure to publish
would also apply to the journalists Snowden had dealt with in Hong
Kong. If Snowden had given Poitras, Greenwald, Lam, or MacAskill
the Merkel document, or even told them about it in their interviews
with him in Hong Kong, The Guardian would have certainly rushed
out such a scoop.

According to a source with knowledge of the Snowden investiga-
tion, there was no document referencing any spying on Merkel’s
phone among the fifty-eight thousand documents on the thumb
drive that Snowden had given to Poitras and Greenwald in Hong
Kong. That absence would explain why Poitras had to send a text to
Snowden in Moscow to ask for an explanation after the story broke.

Further confirmation of the absence of this document in the
material Snowden provided journalists in Hong Kong comes from
James Bamford, a well-respected expert on the NSA. In the course
of researching his 2014 article on Snowden for Wired, he was given
access to all the documents Snowden gave to Poitras, Greenwald, and

© Gellman. Bamford used a sophisticated indexing program to search ©
through the database specifically for the Merkel material. He did not
find any. He reported that no document given to journalists in Hong
Kong even mentioned Merkel. It therefore appeared that the Merkel
document was provided to Der Spiegel after Snowden went to Mos-
cow. If so, some party had access to NSA documents after Snowden
arrived in Russia and provided the Der Spiegel authors with the
scoop. In that context, it might not have been a pure coincidence that
Kucherena disclosed that Snowden had access to documents that he
had not given to journalists in Hong Kong shortly before just such a
document was published in Germany.

Bamford explored the possibility that there might be another per-
son in the NSA who was stealing documents. He wrote to Poitras
and asked her whether the Merkel document could have come from
another person in the NSA. She declined, via a letter from her lawyer,
to answer that question. But because she had not been the author of
the Der Spiegel article, and had not been given the document, there
is no reason to believe that she would know its provenance.

Documents continued to emerge years after Snowden arrived in

Dear Jeff, 
As previously discussed between you and Ariane, Edmond de Rothschild is deeply involved in the building 
and financing of the infrastructure in Europe. Edmond de Rothschild has an outstanding track record, history 
and presence in European infrastructure, as well as being one of Europe's most recognized financial advisors 
to the infrastructure market. We have developed deep expertise in the infrastructure sector and sought 
secure, well-managed assets, generating stable, long-term returns for investors. 
We have done so by initiating and backing two experienced and highly-respected managers in the industry, 
TIIC and BRIDGE. TIIC is an equity investor in transport and social infrastructure. BRIDGE is an infrastructure 
debt provider. Both managers are covered in more detail below. Edmond de Rothschild has been heavily 
involved in the launch of the below funds, providing crucial support in fund structuring, due diligence, 
capital raising, legal & compliance functions as well as the sound governance and ESG management across 
all funds. Partnering with TIIC and BRIDGE has enabled Edmond de Rothschild to build a strong franchise

has also acted as anchor investor for these funds, demonstrating its strong alignment of interest with these 
investment teams. With Ariane we strongly believe that we should absolutely find a way to collaborate 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026069 
together with you to think and initiate something to serve the future needs of the US in the infrastructure 
field. 
Please find attached further information on each manager. This would also be a chance for us to explore 
opportunities of working together in the future. 
Please feel free to reach out to us if you require any further information. We look forward to hearing from 
you soon. 
TIIC 
TIIC Group backed by Edmond de Rothschild, is a pan-European infrastructure firm advising on mid-market 
infrastructure projects across Europe in both the transportation and social sectors. It was established in 
2008 by the 3 founding partners of TIIC Group, Jaime d'Almeida, Manuel Cary and Francisco Mendes, with 
strategic support from the Edmond de Rothschild Group and Brisa. 
The aim of TIIC Group is to bring an operational approach to infrastructure investments in Europe, drawing 
upon the extensive management and financial skills of its team members. These skills have been developed 
over many years at some of Europe's leading infrastructure operators and project financing firms which, 
when combined with the very specific infrastructure expertise of both the Edmond de Rothschild Group and 
Brisa, makes for a powerful and differentiated investment platform. 
TIIC Group operates from two offices in Lisbon and Paris, providing its team with access to relevant 
investment opportunities across key target markets in Europe as well as to leading industrial contractors, 
operators, advisors and financiers in the infrastructure industry. 
TIIC Group successfully raised a First Fund with €140m of commitments targeting transportation 
investments across Europe. The portfolio of the First Fund comprises 6 assets located in Portugal, Spain, 
France and Poland. They represent a carefully balanced mix of greenfield and early stage brownfield projects 
in roads and car parks. TIIC Group has played an active role in the sourcing and development of all 
investments and has made a significant contribution to value creation. TIIC Group believes that this is a high 
quality, operationally secure, cash yielding portfolio of assets which will be of strong interest to potential 
investors over the coming few years. 
TIIC has launched a successor fund, TIIC 2, which will build upon TIIC Group' differentiated approach to 
infrastructure in Europe. TIIC 2 will is targeting aggregate commitments from investors of €300m (€350m 
hard cap) to invest into both transportation and social infrastructure projects in Europe. TIIC 2 will also seek 
to invest, on a very selective basis, into greenfield social infrastructure projects in New Frontier Markets, 
within close proximity to the European Union. Given its powerful network of relationships across Europe and 
the operational skills of its team, TIIC Group will continue to target superior investment returns for TIIC 2's 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026070 
portfolio of assets. These returns should be in line with the anticipated returns from the First Fund portfolio 
which is forecast to deliver a gross IRR of up to 14% and a multiple of approximately 2x on invested capital. 
TIIC announced the first close of TIIC 2 on December 30th 2016, with aggregate commitments of €135m from 
a group of high quality and well-diversified limited partners. First close investors in TIIC 2 include the 
European Investment Bank and Edmond de Rothschild, both with significant commitments, as well as the 
TIIC team. TIIC 2 is also supported by a number of existing investors, together with several European 
insurance companies, pension funds and family offices. A second close is planned in the coming months and 
the final close will occur before the end of 2017. We have received significant interest from a number of 
European institutional investors, many of which are in the process of completing detailed due diligence on 
TIIC 2. We are firmly on track to achieve a final close of TIIC 2 before the end of the year. 
Furthermore, TIIC has announced the first exit from Fund 1, with outstanding returns. Three other 
investments are in sales processes and should close during the next few months. 
BRIDGE 
BRIDGE is an infrastructure debt platform initiated by Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management (EdRAM) to 
enable institutional investors to access infrastructure assets with secured and stable revenue streams. BRIDGE 
is a London based second generation debt fund sourcing and structuring transactions directly from sponsors 
when feasible and one of the few independent debt teams only investing on behalf of clients. The BRIDGE 
team has the ability to execute and deliver transactions as efficiently as traditional lenders as well as negotiate 
terms and conditions bringing optimised yield and security to investors. 
The BRIDGE platform was set up as a new leg of EDR's Infrastructure, Real Assets & Structured Finance Team 
striving to take advantage of the expertise of the infrastructure sector acquired when the team became a 
global leader in PPP & Transport infrastructure financial advisory in 2011 and 2012. 
The BRIDGE platform raised € 400m of new monies in 2016 and has successfully reached the €1bn mark of 
Assets under Management at the end of 2016. The platform comprises three investment vehicles (French FCT 
and Lux SIF) and is currently fundraising for additional pockets of liquidity: 
o BRIDGE I reached final closing in December 2014 with approximately €600m of aggregate commitments from a club 
of institutional investors. 
o BRIDGE I Dedicated Compartmentis a vehicle created by a large European institution and anchor investor of the first 
fund with a €250m target amount available for deployment. 
o BRIDGE II reached first close in December 2016 with €150m of commitments in order to invest in three transactions. 
Fundraising for BRIDGE ll is still ongoing, targeting a group of institutional investors in Europe and elsewhere, with final 
target size of €600m. 
HOUSE OVERSIGHT 026071 
The BRIDGE platform has a long-term European investment strategy and a mandate to cover all sectors of 
infrastructure, notably energy, renewables, utilities, transportation, telecommunications and social 
infrastructure and can execute project financing, refinancing and acquisition finance transactions. 
The BRIDGE platform currently comprises investments of between €20420 million each, in 17 European 
infrastructure transactions. In 2016 alone, the BRIDGE team has achieved financial close for 11 infrastructure 
deals in Europe aggregating ca. €390m. When benchmarked against other similar funds, the investment team 
has succeeded in deploying faster and with credit spreads well above the infrastructure senior debt 
benchmark, enabling BRIDGE to become a force in the growing institutions-backed infrastructure debt market. 
BRIDGE's ability to invest beyond the traditional definition of core infrastructure and to structure transactions 
was a key differentiator when Edmond de Rothschild launched this platform, as part of its commitment to real 
economy. BRIDGE is innovative in the sense that the investment team sources transactions directly from 
sponsors and is actively involved in the structuring phase, acting as Mandated Lead Arranger. 
BRIDGE comprises a large, international and skilled London based investment team of 11 investment 
professionals who between them have arranged more than €100bn of landmark infrastructure deals over the 
last 20 years across the globe. The BRIDGE team is among the largest within the debt funds universe and 
demonstrates the Edmond de Rothschild Group's commitment to the platform.

cabinet meeting the day before, by reviving an idea I’d supported under Rabin: to
build a security fence all along the edge of the West Bank, with a series of
controlled crossing points for people and goods. Yitzhak had said no at the time,
because he was worried it would be seen as a de facto border and undermine the
idea of building coexistence. My view then, and even more so now, was that we
would never get to the point of negotiating a final peace with the Palestinians
unless we could stop at least most of the terror attacks before they happened. Peres,
too, had been worried about “undermining coexistence.” But now, he and the rest
of the cabinet were so shaken by the carnage Hamas had left that they approved the
idea of a security barrier.

At our kirya meeting, hours after the latest bomb had exploded less than a mile
away, Peres recognized we had to go further. Under Oslo, we had begun giving the
Palestinians control over internal security in Gaza and parts of the West Bank.
Since the new Hamas attacks, Arafat had been saying the right things. After the
first bomb in Jerusalem, he’d phoned Shimon to offer condolences, telling
reporters afterward that this was “a terrorist operation. I condemn it completely. It
is not only against civilians, but against the whole peace process.” Yet when it
came to action, we saw no sign that he was willing, ready, or perhaps able to crack
down on the Islamist terror attacks. So Peres now announced that, if necessary in
order to detain known terrorists, we would for the first time send Israeli troops
back into areas where control had been handed back. If Arafat didn’t act, we
would.

On the political front, Peres did get some good news: President Clinton, anxious
to preserve the progress he’d worked so closely with Yitzhak to achieve, organized
an unprecedented show of international condemnation of the terror attacks. With
Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak, he co-chaired a “Summit of Peacemakers” in Sharm al-
Sheikh with the participation not just of an equally concerned King Hussein, and of
course Arafat, but leaders of Arab states from North Africa to Saudi Arabia and the
Gulf. The only significant holdout was Syria’s Hafez al-Assad. He objected
because he said the conference was too focused on Israel. As Foreign Minister, I
accompanied Shimon to the summit. A single day’s meeting was never going to
end terror. But it was unprecedented in the breadth of Arab engagement in an
initiative that, as Assad had anticipated, didn’t just condemn terror in general. It
specifically denounced the attacks being launched inside Israel.

and was less disruptive to Jeffrey. This all seemed for real to begin with, I
was being educated about the body and splitting Jeffrey’s body with
Ghislane, mimicking her every motion. Starting with his feet, we began
with his heels and arches of his soles. Pushing the blood up his calves in
upward strokes to rejuvenate the body’s blood supply and being careful to
mind his leg hair didn’t pull. | was keeping up with her and enjoying the
education. It was so interesting how the body worked and I couldn’t
believe I was learning all of this for free. Once | got a bit of a groove
following Ghislane, they began asking me all sorts of questions about my
past and it didn’t take long before the conversation led down the darker
experiences of my young life. When they found out that I hadn’t led
much of a normal existence they only probed me with more questions,
which being put on the spot answered honestly. The funny thing was they
didn’t seem appalled at all by my statements, rather entertained if
anything. Jeffrey called me a “naughty-girl” with that wry smile of his,
and half playful and half defensive, ! answered “no I’m not, I’m really a
good girl, just always in the wrong places” he then replied, “It’s O.K, I
like naughty girls” and rolled over onto his front side to expose his
complete nude self. He wasn’t the first man to show me his penis, so I
wasn’t shocked at the appearance of his manhood but I was incredibly
shocked at his complete ease to present himself with an erection. I tried to
ignore it waiting to follow the next directions off of Ghislane, who
surprisingly now stood behind me bare breasted. Before I had a chance to
even think of replying hastily she began to slowly undress me, while
Jeffrey started to stroke his manhood while watching us. She unbuttoned
my blouse and removed my bra, revealing my bosoms. Cupping them in
her hands she moved her lips across my nipples, licking and teasing them
with her tongue making them cold and stiff. Next her hands moved down
to my little white skirt, removing the final piece of my remaining
uniform. She slid my skirt down my legs with ease, for a moment keeping
on my love-heart panties, so they could both take notice of my apparent
youth. They even snickered to each other about “ How cute she still wears
little girl pantie’s” Jeffrey said, and Ghislane joined in his laughter.
Acting as my madam, she instructed me to start by licking his nipples
and after I had sufficiently pleasured both of them, then prompted me to
go down on Jeffery orally while she rubbed her breasts along his body
tantalizingly. She moved behind me again this time to remove my panties
and start fondling the delicate folds between my legs. | was still in shock
from the initial degrading blow. I hadn’t even let the reality sink in, it was
all too much for me to emotionally handle so instead I hid behind my
fears, which I told myself “I wasn’t going to ever be worth anything at all
and this would probably be as good as it gets for me” after all I thought,

“what have I been trained up for until now”. Nobody ever stopped to ask
if | was comfortable or if I wanted to stop, no, instead, Ghislane only
directed me to conclude the massage session by climbing up on the table
to be fixated on Jeffrey, straddling him so he could penetrate me.

When it was all done and over with, I was taken into the steam room
with just Jeffrey to get further aquatinted, as Ghislane left the room to go
get dressed. He asked me to grab his feet and rub them not saying a word
about what just happened, like it was all normal and accepted. I listened
to him ramble on about the health benefits of a sauna and the history of it,
ignoring the fact of the matter of his pretentiousness degrading my spirit.
I figured I had gone too far already, what would be the point in throwing
in the towel now after I had done exactly what these people wanted.

Whilst we were sweating out our bodies’ toxins, and the steam was
blasting my burning face I listened to his lessons, entertaining his ego, I
let him become my teacher, he seemed to like that. He sounded like a
very clever and intelligent man though. Telling me his story of how he
made himself an empire of billions from being a middle-class professor to
an elite financial advisor for clientele with only billions in their bank
accounts and through his so-called “lessons”, He became my mentor and
I emerged as his pupil, the teacher’s pet.

After the sauna we went to the next glass door beside us where the
shower was. He turned tap outwards and stood underneath the water as 1
stood naked and cold from the temperature difference. Instead of asking
me to join him under the warm stream, like I thought he was going to, he
handed me a bar of soap and asked me to wash his body from top to toe.
It didn’t stop there I had to massage the shampoo and conditioner into his
scalp as well. I was bewildered someone would ask this off of someone
else, wasn’t it belittling enough having to endure the illicit massage from
beforehand but now this. The surprises kept coming that night, as this
was definitely not how I expected my interview to turn out, but that’s
what I had learned in my short time on this earth, life was full of
disappointment.

I let everyone else take the power of authority from myself and use me
in whatever way he or she wanted instead of standing up and giving
myself the respect I deserved, which in turn would’ve helped me get
through life without all of the abuse I ended up copping. Not given the
belief in myself from an early age on I suppose is what affected my sense
of control. Always letting the one’s with power and strength reduce my
inner-self to shreds until I was cut so tiny in size I would be completely
subdued to only their wants and needs left ignoring mine. The men I had
encountered in my short experience with them only repeated their
inflictions convincing me there was no running away from the sick world

the leaked documents speak for themselves. He allowed the chips to fall where they may and they
often fall on the head of the current office holders around the world.

Prosecuting Wikileaks or its founder for “the crime” of publishing classified information, while at
the same time rewarding -- with prizes, access, interviews, and status — “reputable” journalists and
newspapers for doing essentially the same thing, would constitute selective prosecution.
American law, as distinguished for example from German law, generally permits selective
prosecution of criminals, on the ground that resources are limited and prosecutors must have
some discretion in deciding how to expend their limited resources. In order to “get the most bang
for the buck”, prosecutors are generally free to pick and choose among the many who violate
broad, open-ended and often vague criminal statutes, such as tax, regulatory and criminal
negligence laws. They are not free to exercise this discretion in a partisan manner: going after
members of the opposing political party. Nor can they properly do so on the basis of race,
religion or other protected categories. But they may select for prosecution the most visible or
notorious offenders, since such prosecutions are likely to have the greatest deterrent effect on
other potential law violators. For example, Leona Helmsley, one of the most famous women in
America, was indicted for tax evasion on April 15™!

One area in which it is dangerous and wrong to permit selective prosecution is the publication of
classified information by the media. If the government can pick and choose the few it decides to
prosecute among the many who publish classified information, it will have far too much power
over the content of what the media reports.** The First Amendment recognizes no distinction
between the patriotic and unpatriotic, the responsible and irresponsible, the favorable or
unfavorable, media. It was precisely these improper distinctions that were employed by the John
Adams administration when it selectively enforced the Alien and Sedition laws against
“Jeffersonians”’, “Jacobins”, and other perceived enemies of the Federalists. It took more than a
century and a half for the Supreme Court to declare that although “.. the Sedition Act was never
tested in this court, the attack upon its validity has carried the day in the ‘court of history’, citing
“a broad consensus that the act was inconsistent with the First Amendment”. (I was a law clerk
when that opinion was issued in 1964.)

‘48 The Supreme Court has recognized, in the context of the First Amendment, that a law purporting to regulate
speech or press, in order to survive the “strict scrutiny” standard of review required by the First Amendment, must
not be overinclusive or underinclusive. See Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Assn.: “Underinclusiveness raises
serious doubts about whether the government is in fact pursuing the interest it invokes, rather than disfavoring a
particular speaker or viewpoint... And finally, the Act’s purported aid to parental authority is vastly overinclusive.
Not all of the children who are forbidden to purchase violent video games on their own have parents who care
whether they purchase violent video games. While some of the legislation’s effect may indeed be in support of
what some parents of the restricted children actually want, its entire effect is only in support of what the State
thinks parents ought to want. This is not the narrow tailoring to “assistant parents” that restriction of First
Amendment rights requires...California’s legislation straddles the fence between (1) addressing a serious social
problem and (2) helping concerned parents control their children. Both ends are legitimate, but when they affect
First Amendment rights they must be pursued by means that are neither seriously underinclusive nor seriously
overinclusive. See Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 546 (1993) As a means of
protecting children from portrayals of violence, the legislation is seriously underinclusive, not only because it
excludes portrayals other than video games, but also because it permits a parental or avuncular veto. And as a
means of assisting concerned parents it is seriously overinclusive because it abridges the First Amendment rights
of young people whose parents (and aunts and uncles) think violent video games are a harmless pastime. And the
overbreadth in achieving one goal is not cured by the underbreadth in achieving the other. Legislation such as
this, which is neither fish nor fowl, cannot survive strict scrutiny.”

my understanding of the compensation for a transaction of the magnitude to the penny of the one just
completed. though the number was great it was clear. When it appeared that the details could now be worked
out I was the first to say , itis too much money, however.

From day zero I proposed to discount to 50-60 million the fair price of the transaction just completed .
including Phaidon. . though this amount was already substantially less than our agreed and negotiated
formula. - Iwas never told that this was out of range. in fact, alternative methods of payment. plane, or
an -in-kind payment were discussed (ie including keeping the 30m portion of fee outstanding till March ) ,I
provided as you specifically requested a detailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that
i was given access to. ( Phaidon was not forthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections. I was then
told that Alans involvement warranted a discount. Even in the best of light , though it is beyond question
that not one time in the three years of his retainer has he ever proposed a unique idea. (including any wayt
to deal with the use issue on debras death ,or even the most basic review of your largest asset by far , the BRH
agreement. ) O.K. - lets say he made a contribution to the plan and stretch reality beyond the pale and say it
was 50 %. though no one could posit such a large amount unless they were wearing a brightly colored clown
suit. , the payment associated with the deal was known . It had both sent in writing and spoken about on the
phone numerous times , a detailed execution plan was provided . then and only then after all was laid out for
the group I was told that after a number of conversations with brad karp that a total of only 20m would be
paid , (and even that was more than originally contemplated ) for both transactions . Leon I feel It

was remarkably unfair. I wondered whether brad even knew of our prior agreement.? I called him and he
said he was never told.?, I would ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it would be helpful. . I
would like to send him this email, with your consent of course. Ifthe transactions were never consummated , i
would not be owed a dime, however , the expected fee was known up front. , the detailed step by step plan
was followed and overseen by me, the amount that Ihad requested before the transaction was even begun,
and had already been heavily discounted, out of friendship, from our agreement . I believe the decision re only
paying 20m has frankly , left me felling quite uneasy.

since you asked since last nov. ifound 11 million dollars in dormant accounts. 4 million dollars in eileens
drawer. . went through cash flows for phaidon showing that john murphy is not an accountant. redid your
gagosian contract ,. organized structure in case of divorce. set up gift trust. stopped ada from including
multiple times things not in your interest. dealt with bad sales tax use tax income tax . created 8 millino in
deductions ,500k in mistakes , found bank of scotland fbar problems, . . reorg bad art purchases , funds taken, ,
charitable decisions , helped with fincancial statements, gaming commission. . boat deductions, rescued stock
from grats.. may 1 after months of brad not finding anyone i sent an email saying you would have to pay
more. . on april 15. I sent an email detailing payments owed if i could figure out the basis issue, please see
attached, .

questions you might ask your team ask them to provide a balance sheet or p&l for REgan arts. . doesn't
exist
ask . either wechsler or haperin to tell you what brh is, or how the tra works. .. ? as bronstein to tell you why

the proposed phaidon transaction DOES not work. . ask them to give you a plan for the plane. ? ask them to
show you the cash mgmt for over 100 million dollars. . ask them to show you the IT system progress after one
year. separate from making it more secure though you are not a trader with inside info the approval process for
payables. . the cash flow projections? assumptions? ask for a comparative review of investments. ask haperin
to describe to you in any detail BRH , the major asset of his two biggest clients. tax basis, disposition in the
estate. . etc. ask brad to show you the liquidation of the intervening art space cos? that has been on the table for

deploys on the plain.

On the surface, Israel lacks strategic depth, but this is true only on the
surface. It faces limited threats from southern neighbors. To its east,
it faces only a narrow strip of populated area east of the Jordan. To
the north, there is a maritime commercial entity. Syria operating
alone, forced through the narrow gap of the Mount Hermon-Galilee
line and operating on extended supply lines, can be dealt with readily.
There is a risk of simultaneous attacks from multiple directions.
Depending on the forces deployed and the degree of coordination
between them, this can pose a problem for Israel. However, even here
the Israelis have the tremendous advantage of fighting on interior
lines. Egypt and Syria, fighting on external lines (and widely
separated fronts), would have enormous difficulty transferring forces
from one front to another. Israel, on interior lines (fronts close to
each other with good transportation), would be able to move its
forces from front to front rapidly, allowing for sequential engagement
and thereby the defeat of enemies. Unless enemies are carefully
coordinated and initiate war simultaneously — and deploy
substantially superior force on at least one front — Israel can initiate
war at a time of its choosing or else move its forces rapidly between
fronts, negating much of the advantage of size that the attackers
might have.

There is another aspect to the problem of multifront war. Egypt
usually has minimal interests along the Levant, having its own coast
and an orientation to the south toward the headwaters of the Nile. On
the rare occasions when Egypt does move through the Sinai and
attacks to the north and northeast, it is in an expansionary mode. By
the time it consolidates and exploits the coastal plain, it would be
powerful enough to threaten Syria. From Syria's point of view, the
only thing more dangerous than Israel is an Egypt in control of Israel.
Therefore, the probability of a coordinated north-south strike at Israel

seemed to know. And while the news media had some details
about the underage girls, reporters seemed only to know what
had happened at the moment of his arrest.

Epstein definitely liked his massages. He got them from two,
even three, young women a day, right in his mansion on the
island. He'd been operating on an almost industrial scale. But
who were these girls? Where had they come from? How did they
find their way to his home on a secluded street in Palm Beach?

Epstein had powerful friends. He'd flown Bill Clinton around
in his private jet and rubbed shoulders with heads of state, Nobel
Prize winners, any number of billionaires. Prince Andrew, the
man sixth in line to the British throne, had been a close friend.

Were any of these connections the reason that Epstein was
now a free man?

I wanted to know. After all, our homes were a half mile apart,
and Epstein’s actions had had an undeniable impact on the town
where | lived. Stirred by that sighting of Epstein up in New York,
Tim Malloy and I began to investigate.

We partnered with John Connolly, a tough, no-nonsense
journalist who had once been a cop with the NYPD and had been
following the Epstein story for close to ten years.

Working together, we interviewed Epstein’s friends, going all
the way back to his childhood; we met with Epstein’s acquain-
tances, employees, neighbors, and business associates, and finally
with the families of his victims. We interviewed law enforce-
ment officers who'd worked on the investigation in Palm Beach
and lawyers on all sides of the resulting court cases, some of
which are still working their way through the court system.

Combining our interview material with evidence obtained
from court filings and other investigations, such as the one

a lot of money. I mean, Epstein was identified as a
billionaire in this article, billionaire with -- with a
B, so the record is clear.

But he said, look, if Epstein lost all his
money -~ I'm paraphrasing here -- I would be, you know,
happy to walk down, you know, the Coney Island Boardwalk
with him and discuss things with him, as -- you know,
even if he didn't have any money.

So now I'm seeing Dershowitz is a very close
personal friend of Jeffrey Epstein. And then I started
to look at flight logs. There were -- there were some
very interesting things that I noticed on the flight
logs.

One of the things I noticed was when I began
to, you know, get into this, that, you know, I was
wondering, well, what -- well, how do these flight logs
come into the possession of, you know, law enforcement
agencies? And the answer turned out to be that they had
been provided by Epstein’s defense attorney and -~- and,
you know, coincidentally, I suppose, or in my mind,
suspiciously, they were not provided by just any defense
attorney on this rather large defense team. They were
provided by one attorney according to Detective Recarey.
Detective Recarey testified under oath that the flight
logs were provided to him by Alan Dershowitz.

So one of the things that was -- was
interesting is, Dershowitz has had access to these
flight logs, and now I'm beginning to wonder, well, has
there been an opportunity to sanitize those flight logs
or remove any incriminating information?

And -- and one of the things that was
interesting about the flight logs that were produced --

I believe just so the record is clear, that was Exhibit
1 that -- if we could -- if I could refer -- I need to
refresh my recollection as to -- well, I don't -~ you
may not want me to look at documents,

It was either Exhibit 1 or 2 this morning
during Dershowitz's deposition which was covering a time
period of January to, I believe, September 2005. These
were flight logs that were produced by Mr. Dershowitz to
the Palm Beach Police Department.

And you wonder why did they stop in
September -- you know, why stop in September 2005?
What's the significance of that? Well, later on,
additional flight logs were obtained, and sure enough,
who shows up on an October 2005 flight log with Jeffrey
Epstein? Mr. Dershowitz.

So that led to a suspicion that
Mr. Dershowitz had provided to the Palm Beach Police
Department flight logs that, the time period of which

about this.’ To the women | say, “Now that we heard you, shut the fuck
up for a minute, and let’ s all get back together and kill the Jews.’
That’ s all | have to say about it.”

The audience laughed and applauded, as they did fifty years ago
when Lenny Bruce ended a riff on prejudice: “Randy, it won’ t matter any

My notion of a rape-in of legislators’ wives in order to impregnate

Jews or Lenny’ s beating up the Polacks. Rape-in was a misunderstood
metaphor; a pro-choice parable that unfortunately has become timely
again, but now my target has been clarified, though it's still those
increasingly incredible sexist legislators.

Take Missouri Senator Todd Akin—please. Referring to conception

shark. And when Indiana Senate candidate Richard Mourdock said that if a

A. Okay. The privileged information, obviously,
you're asking me not to reveal at this point.

Q. I'm asking you -- I'm asking you to tell me
the nonprivileged information. And I'm not agreeing

A. All right.

Q. Putting aside what you claim is privileged, I
want to know everything that's the factual basis for
including the allegation about other minors.

A. Okay. Privileged information which I'm not
disclosing in any way would have interacted with a vast
body of other information.

The vast body of other information would have
started with an 89-page police report from the Palm
Beach Police Department that showed for about a
six-month period in 2005, there was sexual abuse of
minor girls going on on a daily basis, in -- whenever
Jeffrey Epstein was in his Paim Beach mansion.

And on some cases, it was going on not once,
not twice, but three times during the day. That -- let

me just be clear. I mean, I -- I referred to the
89-page police report. I have offered to put it into
the record if -- if it would speed things up, but let's
just talk about some of the things that are in that
89-page police report.

This was a -- a very intensive investigation
that the Palm Beach Police Department put together.
They did, for example, what are called trash covers;
that is when trash came out of the -- of the mansion of
Epstein, the police would intercept the trash and then
they would go through the trash and lock for
incriminating information.

And what they began to discover was memo
pads -- and I say memo pads, let's be clear, pad after
pad after pad, or I guess I should say, sheet after
sheet after sheet that had the name of a girl, and then
there was a notation of something to the effect of a
massage.

And so the Palm Beach Police Department began
tracking down, well, wait a minute, these -- these are
girls giving massages and they don't seem to have any
specialized training in massages; they don't seem to be
masseuses in any sense of the term; what's going on
here?

And so the Palm Beach Police Department

began, you know, I guess what we would call
knock-and-talks, knocking on doors to try to get to some
of these girls, and they would get to the girls, and
many of them initially were -- were afraid to explain
what had happened.

But as they -~- as they continued talking to
them, the girls began to explain that what was happening
was, they were going over to Epstein's house under the
guise of giving a massage, and when they got there, the
massage was, in fact, sexual activity.

And for many of the girls, I think, as I say
around 23, 24, something along those lines, they were
underage. They were under the age of consent in
Florida.

And so each and every one of those events was
a crime being perpetrated -- and let's be clear, not
just being perpetrated by Epstein, but by other people
who were involved there at the mansion.

And so what the -- the Palm Beach Police
Department was putting together was that this mansion in
Florida was the nest of sexual abuse of young girls here
in Florida that involved, literally, in the -- in this
period of time, more than a hundred events that they
were able to document of sexual abuse.

And when you put that together with the

ESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS
(954) 331-4400

68
pattern or practice that was being revealed there, there
were hundreds of acts of sexual abuse going on in the
mansion.

But then what becomes -- and this is where I
indicated that, you know, the answer would continue on,
The -- the problem was that the evidence was starting to
show that this was a much broader series of events. For
example, there were flight logs showing that Mr. Epstein
was then flying with underaged girls, and those flight
logs, you know, as -- as the flight logs began to
develop, for example, we have seen, I know in the last
day or two here, one underage girl was Virginia Roberts
who is on the flight, you know, with Epstein, and with
Maxwell, and those sorts of things.

So you start to look at the flight logs and
you see what's going on is not just events that are
occurring in Florida, but it's occurring ona
multi-state basis, which now starts to make it a federal
crime. For example, we are seeing evidence that --
let's just talk about Virginia Roberts since she's
central to this case.

We are seeing Virginia Roberts being flown
from Florida to New York where she's in the clutches of
Jeffrey Epstein who is sexually abusing her, you know,
many times a week. And not just Jeffrey Epstein, but

The Washington Post

From a Saudi prince, tough talk on

America’s favoritism toward Israel
Richard Cohen

June 13 -- As best I can recall, I first met Saudi Arabia’s Prince Turki
al-Faisal at a private home in Washington years ago. I found him
stern and humorless, sometimes even bitter. I have seen him since at
international conferences and the like — never in the mood for small
talk and exhibiting, sometimes in his glorious robes, not an ounce of
Bedouin charm. Still, | was unprepared for the opinion column he
published in Sunday’s Post. It read like a declaration of war.

Prince Turki is not now in the government. Yet he is a member of the
Saudi royal family and was once the kingdom’s intelligence chief and
its former ambassador to both London and Washington. The man is
solidly credentialed.

He is also angry as hell, and he lets America have it. He starts by
citing what he calls President Obama’s “controversial speech last
month, admonishing Arab governments to embrace democracy and
provide freedom to their populations.” Saudi Arabia, he wrote, heard
what Obama said and took it “seriously,” and he noted, of course,
that Obama had not demanded the same rights for Palestinians under
Israeli occupation. Point taken.

But the same kingdom that has taken Obama “seriously” is an
absolute monarchy that, among other things, bans women from
driving cars. It is also a country that offers no freedom of religion but
offers, for the occasional criminal, a public beheading. Given that
Turki has spent a good deal of time in the West, it’s not possible that

"
IMAGES-004-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017566.txt,"“Well, one thing I’ve always really enjoyed is making

things. Out of whatever. It started with modeling as a kid,
building models. When computers came along, I started
learning programming and realizing the computer was this
great tool for making things, making models, dynamic models,
and behaviors, not just static models. I think when I started
doing games I really wanted to carry that to the next step, to
the player, so that you give the player a tool so that they can
create things. And then you give them some context for that
creation. You know, what is it, what kind of kind of world

does it live in, what’s its purpose? What are you trying to do
with this thing that you’re creating? To really put the player

in the design role. And the actual world is reactive to their
design. So they design something that the little world inside
the computer reacts to. And then they have to revisit the
design and redesign it, or tear it down and build another one,
whatever it is. So I guess what really draws me to interactive
entertainment and the thing that I try to keep focused on is
enabling the creativity of the player. Giving them a pretty large
solution space to solve the problem within the game. So the
game represents this problem landscape. Most games have
small solution landscapes, so there’s one possible solution and
one way to solve it. Other games, the games that tend to be
more creative, have a much larger solution space, so you can
potentially solve this problem in a way that nobody else has. If
you're building a solution, how large that solution space is gives
the player a much stronger feeling of empathy. If they know
that what they’ve done is unique to them, they tend to care for
it a lot more. I think that’s the direction I tend to come from.”

Wright believes that simulations as games
can be used to improve education by teaching
children how to learn. In his own words:

“The problem with our education system is we’ve
taken this kind of narrow, reductionist, Aristotelian approach
to what learning is. It’s not designed for experimenting
with complex systems and navigating your way through
them in an intuitive way, which is what games teach. It’s not

really designed for failure, which is also something games
teach. I mean, I think that failure is a better teacher than
success. Trial and error, reverse-engineering stuff in your
mind—all the ways that kids interact with games—that’s
the kind of thinking schools should be teaching. And I
would argue that as the world becomes more complex, and
as outcomes become less about success or failure, games
are better at preparing you. The education system is going
to realize this sooner or later. It’s starting. Teachers are
entering the system who grew up playing games. They’re
going to want to engage with the kids using games.”

Wright will appear as a character in the video game
Mr. T, where he will team up with Mr. T to fight Nazis.

Wright was given a “Lifetime Achievement
Award” at the Game Developers Choice Awards in 2001.

In 2002, he became the fifth person to be inducted into the
Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences’ Hall of Fame.
Until 2006, he was the only person to have been honored
this way by both of these industry organizations. In 2007
the British Academy of Film and Television Arts awarded
him a fellowship, the first given to a game designer.

He has been called one of the most important
people in gaming, technology, and entertainment by
publications such as Entertainment Weekly, Time, PC Gamer,
Discover and GameSpy. Wright was also awarded the PC
Magazine Lifetime Achievement Award in January 2005.

In 1980, along with co-driver and race organizer
Rick Doherty, Wright participated in the U.S. Express,

a cross-country race that was the predecessor to The
Cannonball Run. Wright and Doherty drove a specially
outfitted Mazda RX-7 from Brooklyn, New York to Santa
Monica, California in 33:39, winning the illegal race. Wright
only competed once in the race, which continued until 1983.

Since 2003, in his spare time, Wright has collected
leftovers from the Soviet space program, “including a
100-pound hatch from a space shuttle, a seat from a
Soyuz... control panels from the Mir”, and the control

console of the Soyuz 23, as well as dolls, dice, and
fossils. During E3 2004 he passed off an old lapel pin
commemorating the Soviet space program to a reporter.
“T’m uncollecting. I buy collections on eBay, and I
disperse them out to people again. I have to be like an entropic
force to collectors, otherwise all of this stuff will get sorted.”
He once built competitive robots for BattleBots
with his daughter, but no longer does so. As of November
2006, Wright still had remnant bits of machined metal left
over from his BattleBots days strewn about the garage of his
Oakland home. Wright was a former Robot Wars champion
in the Berkeley-based robotics workshop, the Stupid Fun
Club. One of Wright’s bots, designed with the help of Wright’s
daughter Cassidy, “Kitty Puff Puff”, fought against its
opponents by sticking a roll of gauze onto its armature and
circling around them, encapsulating them and denying them
movement. The technique, cocooning, was eventually banned.
Following his work in BattleBots, he has taken
steps into the field of human-robot interactions.
“We build these robots and we take them down to
Berkeley and study the interactions that people have with
the robots,” says Wright. “We built this newer one that has a
rapid-fire pingpong cannon. It will fire about 10 per second.
So we give people this plastic bat and we say, ‘It’s set up to
play baseball. Do you want to play baseball? It’s going to
shoot a little ball and you try to hit it.’ And all of a sudden
it’s like da-da-da-da, and it’s pelting them with balls.”
After building his reputation as one of the most
important game designers in the world, Wright in 2009
left Maxis, the Electronic Arts owned studio he founded.
His first post-E.A. venture was the Stupid Fun Club.
In October 2010, Current TV announced that
Will Wright will produce a new show for the network. The
program, entitled Bar Karma, began airing in February 2011.
In October 2011, Will Wright became
a member of the Board of Directors of Linden
Lab, the creators of Second Life.

Platform Beta

Equity market performance is a large predictor of returns for many long/short equity hedge funds, due to the
large equity beta exposure with which many funds run.* At Boothbay, we generally run with limited net
equity market exposure (on average 6-8% historically) and have maintained low correlation to market
indices. While the sources of our returns will generally be idiosyncratic, there is no question that the
tremendous amount of capital that has flown into the low-net multi-manager, i.e. “platform”, category, has
created an even greater risk of exposure to “Platform Beta” for some of our managers, even while avoiding
broader equity market beta.

Platform Beta is a term we have heard used to describe the overlap of long and short positions, across some
of the largest market-neutral, multi-manager hedge fund managers. While these overlapping names may be
viewed as “smart money” positioning in some sense, there is also meaningful risk associated with being in
crowded longs and shorts due to the viciousness of the cascading effects when these portfolios are being
liquidated, or re-sized quickly, as we observed in Q1 2016. For a variety of reasons, we believe that
Platform Beta has a true positive expectancy over time and with much less risk than other traditional factor
risks, especially ones taken on by long-only or long-biased investors. While we consider it to be an obvious
goal to avoid material exposure to all known market risk factors, we also attempt to reduce our more
difficult to measure Platform Beta exposure when possible. Despite the positive return expectation of
Platform Beta, we do not think a large or concentrated exposure to this factor is beneficial. Perhaps even
more importantly, we do not believe that all alpha is created equally, and we are trying to provide the most
uncorrelated alpha as possible to our investors.

So how do we minimize overexposure to Platform Beta? We can monitor data that imperfectly points to
crowded names or themes, but the most direct way we seek to avoid crowded names is through our overall
portfolio construction and manager-selection process. This is demonstrated in our continued focus on “First
Loss” allocations as well as investments in the strategy category we call “Other”, which is comprised of
niche strategies outside our more traditional long/short fundamental and quantitative strategies. These
alternative categories have served as a valuable source of alpha as well as diversification away from
Platform Beta. Additionally, even in our more traditional strategies, we focus on allocating to smaller
managers who can have larger parts of their portfolios in smaller capitalization companies, which tend to be
less trafficked by the larger funds, and therefore are also less subject to the effects of large industry
deleveraging. We cannot avoid all of the dangers of hedge fund deleveraging but our conscious attempts to
target differentiated strategies, and to limit concentration, has allowed us to be less impacted by these flows
than several other multi-manager platforms.

Portfolio Attribution and Risk

Within our Multi-Strategy platform, the “Other” category was the largest contributor for both Q4 and 2016
overall, contributing gross returns of +0.82% in Q4 and +2.19% YTD. The remaining quarterly and full-year
gross return attribution within the Multi-Strategy platform were: “Fundamental L/S” at -0.86% in Q4 and
+1.16% YTD, and “Quantitative” at 0.29% in Q4 and -1.53% YTD. Our First Loss platform allocations
contributed gross-returns of +0.72% in Q4 and +6.60% YTD.”

The Fund averaged approximately 0.39% daily Value at Risk during Q4 vs. 0.41% in Q3 (95% Confidence
Interval, excluding First-Loss allocations). As stated in last quarter’s letter, we expect to see an increase in
our VaR during Q1 2017 primarily through a combination of new manager allocations and a pick-up in
overall market volatility due to macro events on the horizon. We expect the Trump Presidency, additional

Although he has spent more than a year in jail and paid out what may
be as much as $20 million, he yet seems somehow to have gotten away with
it—that worst sin of all. He is the unrepentant catch all of up-to-the-minute
badness: the financier whose wealth is a product of Wall Street math rather
than work; a rich middle-age white man who not only parades his wealth and
entitlement, but has a Peter Pan complex to boot; an insistent Playboy in a
correct and prudish world—someone who somehow didn’t get the memo
about vast changes in mores and culture.

When I suggested recently that one obvious way to blunt the animus
would be to get married, he said he’d rather go back to jail.

He is Calvin Harris’s song, It Was Acceptable in the 80s, come to life.

This is all, of course, a Gatsby-like tale: An enigmatic, and strangely
appealing figure, able to invent and inhabit his own world is a mystery to try
to decipher. Of course Gatsby in New York Post and Daily Mail parlance
would likely be just a freaky financier too.

And this story is, in its way, about the limitation of journalism, in
which the most compelling parts of the tale—Epstein’s ambitions and
impulses would be well suited to a long running cable drama—need to be
sacrificed not just to moral certainty but to a rather preposterous fantasy of
moral certainty.

Anyway, I hope I get invited back to Jeffrey’s house soon.

LAWYERS

J hw was a running sweepstakes or office pool for the unhappiest
person in the White House. Many had held the title, but one of the
most frequent winners was White House counsel Don McGahn. He was
a constant target for his boss's belittling, mocking, falsetto-voice mimicry,
and, as well, sweeping disparagements of his purpose and usefulness.

“This is why we can’t have nice things,” McGahn uttered almost obses-
sively under his breath, quoting the Taylor Swift song to comment on
whatever egregious act Trump had just committed (“ . . because you break
them,” the song continues).

McGahn's background was largely as a federal election lawyer. Mostly
he was on the more-money, less-transparency side—he was against, rather
than for, aggressive enforcement of election laws. He served as the counsel
to the Trump campaign, arguably among the most careless about election
law compliance in recent history. Before joining the Trump administra-
tion, McGahn had no White House or executive branch experience. He
had never worked in the Justice Department or, in fact, anywhere in gov-
ernment. Formerly an attorney for a nonprofit affiliated with the Koch
brothers, he was known as a hyperpartisan: when Obama’s White House
counsel, Kathy Ruemmler, the previous occupant of McGahr’s office,
reached out to congratulate him and to offer to be a resource on past prac-
tices, McGahn did not respond to her email.

SIEGE 39

One of McGahn's jobs was to navigate what was possibly the most
complicated relationship in modern government: he was the effective
point person between the White House and the Department of Justice.
Part of his portfolio, then, was to endure the president's constant rage and
bewilderment about why the DO] was personally hounding him, and his
incomprehension that he could do nothing about it.

“It’s my Justice Department,’ Trump would tell McGahn, often repeat-
ing this more than dubious declaration in his signature triad.

Nobody could quite be certain of the number of times McGahn had
had to threaten, with greater or lesser intention, to quit if Trump made
good on his threat to fire the attorney general, the deputy attorney gen-
eral, or the special counsel. Curiously, one defense against the charge that
the president had tried to fire Mueller in June 2017 in an effort to end the
special counsel's investigation—as the New York Times claimed in a Jan-
uary 2018 scoop—was the fact that Trump was almost constantly trying
to fire Mueller or other DOJ figures, doing so often multiple times a day.

McGahn’s steadying hand had so far helped avert an ultimate crisis.
But he had missed or let slip by or simply ignored a number of intemper-
ate, unwise, and interfering actions by the president that might, McGahn
feared, comprise the basis of obstruction charges. Deeply involved with the
conservative Federalist Society and its campaign for “textualist” judges.
McGahn had long dreamed himself of becoming a federal judge him-
self, but given the no-man’-land he occupied between Trump and the
Justice Department—not to mention Trump’s sometimes daily attacks or
the DOJ’s independence, which McGahn had to accept or condone—he
knew his future as a jurist was dead.

Fifteen months into Trumps tenure, the tensions between the administra-
tion and the Department of Justice had erupted into open conflict. Now it
was war—the White House against its own DO).

Here was a modern, post-Watergate paradox: the independence o:
the Justice Department. The DOJ might be, from every organizationa
and statutory view, an instrument of the White House, and, as much a:
any other agency, its mission might appear to be driven by whoever hele

imagine one of you selling me three pieces of property. If I fail to pay for the
first one on time, you might not immediately cancel the contract. You might
even be ready to help me collect the necessary money. But you would never
proceed to deliver the second property before I paid for the first one, unless you
were a fool.” I also warned of longer-term dangers: “terrorism, radical Islamic
fundamentalism, the proliferation of surface-to-surface missiles and weapons of
mass destruction, and threats to the long-term stability of the more pragmatic
Arab regimes.” I singled out Iran, because it was determined to export its brand
of fundamentalism Islam, sponsor terror and develop a nuclear weapon.

I also accompanied CSIS colleagues on speaking engagements to other
American cities. I was about to board a flight to Seattle in April when I got a
message saying Rabin wanted to talk to me. After we took off, I used the on-
board phone facility and, with a swipe of a credit card, was soon on the line to
the Prime Minister. Since the exchange was in Hebrew, I’m fairly sure anyone
overhearing me had no idea what we were talking about. “I need you to come
back as soon as possible,” Rabin said. I already knew, from Giora, that he was
anxious to find a long-term replacement as Minister of Interior. The leading
light in the Sephardi religious party Shas, Arye Deri, had had to leave the post
under allegations of bribe-taking. After Rabin had taken on the portfolio himself
four 18 months, he had placed Labor’s Uzi Baram there, but only as a
temporary arrangement. I didn’t feel I could refuse outright. But I reminded him
that under army rules, “as soon as possible” still meant another 100 days. And
ideally, I said I wanted to finish the best part of a year in Washington. I asked
whether it would be possible to join the cabinet in the middle of November
instead. “What difference will a few more months make?”

Rabin said he needed me now, and that mid-November would be too late.
“Ehud, in politics, you can never predict what will happen by then.” Neither of
us could have known how terribly prophetic his words would turn out to be.

I was not only new to cabinet politics. I wasn’t even a member of the
Knesset. But in addition to naming me as head of a major ministry — in charge
of everything from citizenship and immigration to planning, zoning, and the
funding of local government — Rabin made me a member of his “inner cabinet”

their homes and even see who is ringing the doorbell, in many cases right from their smart phones.
Systems such as QuietCare, WellAWARE, FineThanx and SimplyHome are already fixtures in
some U.S. homes and seniors’ communities, although Orlov estimates fewer than 10,000 units are
in active use because the systems can be so costly.

Next month, Paul Whyte, a Markham dealer of smart-home technology that allows ordinary
electronics and appliances to communicate with each other, will unveil the GrandCare system at
the Zoomer show in Toronto.

“T call it the invisible caregiver,” says Whyte of Cybernetics Systems Inc. “The minute I saw this
system I thought, ‘There’s something that actually makes sense.’

The key, of course, with all these technologies is that the senior be relatively able-bodied and
sound of mind — most are of limited value if the senior is suffering from dementia, which is
expected to become a major public health issue in the next few decades.

But developers are also working hard on that challenging front.

Sometime later this fall or next spring the first GPS-equipped shoe, the Aetrex Ambulator, will go
on sale through www.gpsshoe.com orwww.foot.com.

Originally designed for children by Los Angeles-based GTX Corp., the new shoes are expected to
retail for about $250 U.S. They enable caregivers to track those afflicted with dementia or
Alzheimer’s thanks to GPS and cellular technology that will relay their whereabouts back to a
monitoring centre.

“Privacy may be a talking point, but it’s not really an issue,” says Patrick Bertagna, chairman and
CEO of GTX Corp.

MED Cottage creator Dupin expects concerns around privacy will fade quickly as families and
health-care systems here and in the U.S. become overwhelmed by aging baby boomers — more
than 76 million in the U.S., 10 million in Canada — who start hitting 65 next year.

“T see remote monitoring becoming an integral part of health care as we all age,” says Dupin. “One
of the issues around aging in place is going to be making trade-offs. Privacy may be something we

have to give up.”

The First Amendment seemed to be in full bloom at Harvard. No one was being prevented from
expressing his or her views. The Quincy House Film Society was going to show Deep Throat; the
Harvard administration was expressing but not imposing its views; the feminists were preparing
pamphlets, slide shows, and speakers to present theirs; and everyone was free to see and listen to
all or none of these expressions.

The feminists seemed to be making their point quite effectively: more students were expected on
the picket lines and at the slide show than at the movie itself. Many in the Harvard community,
while supporting the right of the Quincy House Film Society to show Deep Throat, now believed
that the society had been insensitive to the feelings of their feminist housemates by exhibiting an
offensive film in the dormitory that was home to them all. I shared that view.

Then everything changed. Days before the scheduled showing, two women residents of Quincy
House, not satisfied to protest and picket, called the local District Attorney’s office and asked the
police to prevent the showing of Deep Throat and to arrest the students who were planning to
show it.

The local District Attorney was an elderly political hack named John Droney, who had repeatedly
won reelection on an uncompromising law-and-order platform. When he learned that the twin
evils of obscenity and Harvard might merge on that fateful night, he dispatched an assistant to
court in an effort to secure an injunction against the scheduled showing.

If there is anything more obnoxious to a civil libertarian than the punishment of speech after it has
taken place, it is the issuance of a prior injunction to prevent speech in the first place. Prior
restraint—as an injunction against speech has come to be known—s the purest form of
censorship. It seeks to prevent the speech from ever reaching the public. Now, almost ten years
after the Supreme Court had rebuffed efforts to enjoin publication of the Pentagon Papers, the
District Attorney of Middlesex County was seeking to enjoin the showing of a dirty movie to a
small group of students in a college dormitory at Harvard.

Only hours before the scheduled performance, Carl Stork and Nathan J. Hagen—the co-
presidents of the Quincy House Film Society—received telephone calls from the D.A.’s office
directing them to be in Judge Charles R. Alberti’s courtroom at two o’clock for a hearing. Stork
and Hagen tried to call me in my office. But I was at lunch, and my secretary couldn’t locate me.
Stork and Hagen told her the story and requested that I come to the court to assist them as soon
as possible. I returned from lunch at two-fifteen, to learn that I was expected in court—fifteen
minutes earlier!

I quickly borrowed a colleague’s ill-fitting jacket, dug an old brown tie out of my desk drawer,
and drove to the courthouse in downtown Cambridge.

Within minutes, I found myself before Judge Alberti, arguing against the injunction. With no
books, cases, or statutes in my possession, I had to wing it. The judge was most understanding,

asking the Assistant District Attorney to let me look over his shoulder at the relevant statute and
cases.

Anca Dragan

Anca Dragan is an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and
Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley. She co-founded and serves on the steering
committee for the Berkeley AI Research (BAIR) Lab and is a co-principal investigator in
Berkeley’s Center for Human-Compatible Al.

At the core of artificial intelligence is our mathematical definition of what an AI agent (a
robot) is. When we define a robot, we define states, actions, and rewards. Think of a
delivery robot, for instance. States are locations in the world, and actions are motions
that the robot makes to get from one position to a nearby one. To enable the robot to
decide on which actions to take, we define a reward function—a mapping from states and
actions to scores indicating how good that action was in that state—and have the robot
choose actions that accumulate the most “reward.” The robot gets a high reward when it
reaches its destination, and it incurs a small cost every time it moves; this reward function
incentivizes the robot to get to the destination as quickly as possible. Similarly, an
autonomous car might get a reward for making progress on its route and incur a cost for
getting too close to other cars.

Given these definitions, a robot’s job is to figure out what actions it should take in
order to get the highest cumulative reward. We’ve been working hard in AI on enabling
robots to do just that. Implicitly, we’ve assumed that if we’re successful—if robots can
take any problem definition and turn into a policy for how to act—we will get robots that
are useful to people and to society.

We haven’t been too wrong so far. If you want an AI that classifies cells as either
cancerous or benign, or a robot that vacuums the living room rug while you’re at work,
we've got you covered. Some real-world problems can indeed be defined in isolation,
with clear-cut states, actions, and rewards. But with increasing AI capability, the
problems we want to tackle don’t fit neatly into this framework. We can no longer cut
off a tiny piece of the world, put it in a box, and give it to a robot. Helping people is
starting to mean working in the real world, where you have to actually interact with
people and reason about them. “People” will have to formally enter the AI problem
definition somewhere.

Autonomous cars are already being developed. They will need to share the road
with human-driven vehicles and pedestrians and learn to make the trade-off between
getting us home as fast as possible and being considerate of other drivers. Personal
assistants will need to figure out when and how much help we really want and what types
of tasks we prefer to do on our own versus what we can relinquish control over. A DSS
(Decision Support System) or a medical diagnostic system will need to explain its
recommendations to us so we can understand and verify them. Automated tutors will
need to determine what examples are informative or illustrative—not to their fellow
machines but to us humans.

Looking further into the future, if we want highly capable Als to be compatible
with people, we can’t create them in isolation from people and then try to make them
compatible afterward; rather, we’ll have to define “human-compatible” AI from the get-
go. People can’t be an afterthought.

Al, Information, and Democracy

(Incorporating contributions from Shahar Avin, Sean O hEigeartaigh, David McAllester, Eric Horvitz,

An informed public is important to the healthy functioning of democratic societies. We can expect
potential forthcoming advances around the control of information feeds with applications in
spreading propaganda, via spreading false or misleading information, creating anxiety, fueling
conspiracy theories, and influencing voting. Such methods will bring key challenges to democracy.

CHALLENGES AHEAD WITH Al, PROPOGANDA, AND PERSUASION

Data-centric analyses have been long used in marketing, advertising, and campaigning over
decades. However, over the past few years, we have seen the rise of the use of more powerful
tools, including machine learning and inference aimed at algorithmic manipulation, with the target
of influencing the thinking and actions of people. Some initial uses of these methods reportedly
played a role in influencing the outcome of recent US presidential elections, as well as the
elections in 2008 and 2012. We can expect to see an upswing in methods that manipulate states of
information in a personalized automated manner. These systems can be designed and deployed as
omnipresent/persistent, and aimed at specific goals for group- or person-centric persuasion.

As our data and models of how people consume and act on information improve, and as an
increasing portion of information consumption is mediated through digital systems managed by
potentially opaque algorithms, it becomes increasingly conceivable that the information ecosystem
would get captured by malicious actors deploying increasingly advanced tools to control, shape,
forge and personalize information, from ads to news reports.

Machine learning, in conjunction with active learning, expected value decision making, and
optimization of allocations of key resources, such as dollars or human effort, can be targeted at
monitoring, understanding, and then working to influence the beliefs and actions of large
populations of people. Data can be collected from large-scale populations, across multiple devices
and services, and used to make inferences about the psychologies and beliefs of people, and for
designing and guiding persuasive flows of sequences of information. Uses of Al can include
attempts to optimize stealthiness of the interventions.

In the future, a great deal of the information consumed by citizens on personal devices is subject
to alteration by information-engineers at media corporations and governmental propaganda
offices, such that outside a few key positions of power no one really knows what is going on in the
world. There is a danger of the growth of domination over time of large populations by a single
dominant or a few systems. We can imagine methods that modify even such feeds as Wikipedia
articles, creating personalized views—that subtly shift the version of the article seen by my

also said that he was “100 percent” certain that no foreign intelli-
gence service had had access to them at any point during his journey
from Honolulu to Moscow. When I later asked Kucherena in Mos-
cow why Snowden changed his story in direct contradiction of what
Kucherena had stated, he said, “Wizner.”

He was referring to Ben Wizner, Snowden’s ACLU lawyer in
Washington, D.C. Wizner had joined the ACLU in August 2001
after graduating from NYU Law School and clerking for a federal
judge. At the ACLU, he became an effective foe of NSA surveillance.
“IT had spent ten years before this [Snowden leak] trying to bring
lawsuits against the intelligence community,” he explained in an
interview with Forbes in 2014. Prior to the Snowden leak, he had
frequently been consulted by Poitras on government surveillance
issues (and appeared in Poitras’s 2010 documentary, The Oath). He
had also been engaged in a lawsuit aimed at exposing the NSA’s sub-
poenas for Verizon records.

He had first learned about Snowden from Poitras in January
2013 while Snowden was still working for Dell at the NSA base in

© Hawaii. At that time, Poitras did not know Snowden’s real name, but ©
she informed Wizner that she was in touch with a person identify-
ing himself as a senior officer in U.S. intelligence. (Poitras did not
know at that time that her source, Snowden, was lying to her about
his position.) Wizner also was shown e-mails by Poitras in which
Snowden said he had information about the government’s secret
domestic surveillance program. Wizner, according to Poitras, advised
her to stay in touch with this source.

On July 13, 2013, after Snowden asked for asylum in Russia,
Kucherena arranged an encrypted chat between Snowden and Wiz-
ner. According to Wizner, Snowden asked him at the outset, “Do you
have standing now?” It was a question that suggested that Snowden
was aware that the ACLU needed to gain standing in federal court to
challenge the government's alleged domestic surveillance. Up until
now, it was unsuccessful because it had no way to show it was a vic-
tim of surveillance. The FISA order to Verizon, which Snowden had
taken had provided that standing to Wizner and the ACLU.

Aside from the opportunity Snowden offered the ACLU, Wiz-
ner no doubt believed in the salutary benefit of Snowden’s revela-

volume, the pastor introduced a forty-ish, sparkly eyed, somewhat overweight, dark
haired, slightly made up woman who the Pastor said was a witness for the ultimate
in Christian forgiveness. She was someone from whom all of us could learn. She

at least once a year. The woman said that her successful struggle for forgiveness

When my sons introduced me to him as we filed out at the end of the service, the
pastor told me that my visit was important to the congregation. He told me that Jews
were special in Charismatic Christianity since we would play an important role in the

IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019857.txt,"Supreme Court Rejects Newman Requirement of “Pecuniary or Similarly Valuable” Personal
Benefit for Insider Trading Liability for Tipping Family and Friends (continued trom page 1)

as a personal benefit necessary to be held liable
for insider trading.? Sa/man will almost certainly
embolden the SEC and federal prosecutors to
bring more insider trading cases, because it Is
much easier for the government to prove a “gift”
to a “friend” than to prove a “pecuniary” or similar
quid pro quo.

In Sa/man, an investment banker at Citigroup
tipped his brother about certain pending health-
care mergers involving Citigroup clients. The
brother traded on that information for a profit,
and also tipped his brother-in-law, Mr. Salman,
who also traded for a profit. At trial, the govern-
ment relied solely on the tippers giving a gift of

inside information to a close family member to
satisfy the “personal benefit” requirement of tip-
per-tippee insider trading liability. The government
did not identify any money or other valuable quid
pro quo paid for the tip. Salman was convicted at
trial, and his conviction was upheld by the Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

Client Alert: Status of the New DOL Fiduciary Rule (continued from page 1)

a better commission for the adviser. The Obama
administration found that conflicted advice cost
savers about $17 billion a year based on a 2015
report. To be clear, the Rule applies only to retire-
ment accounts like 401(k)s and individual retire-
ment accounts (“IRAs”), not to regular taxable
accounts. According to the Investment Company
Institute, Americans invest $7.8 trillion in IRAs
and $7 trillion in 401(k)s.

On January 20, 2017, the DOL issued two new
sets of Frequently Asked Questions (“FAQs”) on
the Rule. One of the sets of FAQs focuses on the
new definition of fiduciary investment advice
and the other set is geared toward retirement
investors and consumers, covering consumer
protection features of the new Rule. This is the
second of three rounds of guidance to be pub-
lished by the DOL prior to the effective date of
the new Rule.

The Executive Branch also issued responses to
the Rule on January 20, 2017. The White House
issued a Memorandum from Reince Priebus to the
heads of the executive departments and agencies
requesting a sixty (60)-day delay as the effective
date of regulations published in the Office of the
Federal Register have not taken effect as of yet.

On February 3, 2017, President Trump signed a
presidential memorandum to delay the Rule by
six (6)-months, casting doubt on its viability.
The memorandum instructs the DOL to conduct

a new “economic and legal analysis’ to deter-
mine whether the Rule is likely to harm inves-
tors, disrupt the industry or cause an increase
in litigation and the price of advice. If the DOL
concludes that the regulation does hurt inves-
tors or firms, it can propose a rule “rescind-
ing or revising” the regulation. On March 1,
2017, the DOL issued a proposed rule, which
will extend the applicability date of its fidu-
ciary rule, including the Best Interest Contract
Exemption, from April 10, 2017 to June 9, 2017,
a 60-day delay.

Some are saying the Rule would hurt investors
because it would supposedly make it harder
for people to receive retirement advice. For
example, advisers would not be able to afford
to service low-balance retirement accounts.
On the other hand, consumer, labor and civil
rights groups have pushed for the Rule saying
that the current system provides a loophole
that lets brokers drain money from retirement
accounts in fees they receive that can sway
the investment advice they give their retire-
ment accounts. We see that many retirement
advisers already have chosen to act in their
clients’ best interests, opting to work under
the fiduciary standard—it is ultimately a
business advantage.

The FAQs are available on the DOL’s website
and the Memoranda are available on the White
House Press Office website.

HOUSE OVERSIGHT 033145 
"
IMAGES-005-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018591.txt,"Were we stupid? Obviously. Were we normal? Unfortunately, yes. A few months ago, I
chatted with another American HIV educator about the situation here in Africa. They
know to use condoms, she complained, and they have the condoms! I just don't get it!

I agree that it's incomprehensible, I said, but hey, I haven't always been 100% careful,
and I'm a sex educator.

She glanced at me, then away. Yeah, I haven't either,” she admitted. There was a gloomy
pause, and then we couldn't help it -- we cracked up. I hate love, she said when the
giggles subsided. She shook her head. That shit fucks with you.

Why didn't I use condoms with that ex? I still don't know! When you instruct people to
use condoms as often as I do, you get accustomed to the arguments. I hear the same
reasons we didn't use condoms -- because they don't feel as good, because they interrupt
the moment, etc. etc. etc. -- I hear them, I smile and I tell the audience, You gotta use
‘em anyway, folks. I'm a hypocrite, but what else can I say?

And there are deeper-rooted objections to condoms -- objections that are both rarely
stated in public, and harder to confront. One is trust, which I've been struggling with for a
long time, since before I got to Africa. I don't think it's good for condom discussions to
center on trust, and I wish I had more ideas about how to refocus them. Use condoms
because you can't trust anyone, not even your lover, is an ugly message to impart.
Moreover, it only encourages the audience to view not using condoms as a gift, or a
signifier of trust.

In America, I tend to cast it like this: Safer sex is normal. It's the baseline. Lots of people
practice it. It's an assumption. Act like it. Which, I hope, helps people simply default to
safer sex without forcing direct questions about any given partner's integrity. Hopefully,
it also distracts attention from seeing discarding condoms as a gift. But the truth is that
condom usage isn't always an assumption even in America (witness myself and my ex).
And it's less of an assumption here in Africa. How can I avoid validating the viewpoint
that not using condoms is the best way to express trust?

The second deep-rooted objection -- again, both in Africa and America -- is inability to
maintain an erection while using a condom. When I was younger, I used to think that
guys were just whining when they claimed they couldn't keep it up with a condom, but in
my old age I've determined that People Are Different (no way!): while most men deal
with condoms just fine, some men genuinely can't. Since people tend to be bad at
communicating about sex and especially bad at making space for conversations about
non-normative male sexuality, this isn't often acknowledged. Fortunately, the solution is
easy: men who have trouble with condomised penis-in-vagina sex gain a glorious
opportunity to explore all the other kinds of sex!

People tend to panic when confronted with the idea of a man who can't have penetrative
sex. But that's sex-negative nonsense based entirely on the stereotype of real sex as
penis-in-vagina intercourse. The solution to loss of erection isn't to sit around awkwardly
wishing you could be having penetrative sex. The solution is for both partners to start
exploring with mouths, hands... and words. But teaching about this means speaking very
explicitly, and it can be hard to have those conversations in a conservative society

stricter program. Ask it to count up from one until you get to a number
representing the novel War and Peace and then print it, stop and ring a

bell.
Loop i++ until i == “War and Peace...”; Print i; ring-bell;

This program succeeds!

I am triumphant. I have calculated the War and Peace number, and
this time I did not miss the event. But, if you consider this a little more
deeply I gave the computer the answer! I told it the string “War and
Peace...” and it was able to count up, stop, and tell me it reached it. In
mathematical terminology, the program is said to have ‘halted’ when it
reached the War and Peace number and in computer science speak it
is a special purpose program designed to do only this one thing. This
program is pointless. First, it would still take a ginormous amount of
time to get there and, second, it is trivially the same as running the
program: Print War and Peace.

i = “War and Peace...”; Print i;

It’s just the same as me taking my laptop, finding War and Peace and
pressing print. In no way is this equivalent to Leo Tolstoy’s creative effort
of writing War and Peace in the first place.

What went wrong?

I wanted my computer to find an interesting string I did not already
know. War and Peace is trivially computable after Leo Tolstoy created it
but the question is whether my computer could come up with War and
Peace or some similar creative work on its own. Can it create and, more
importantly, understand it has created something? We have linked the
ideas of creativity and understanding, and this will prove to be the key
to the problem.

IMAGES-011-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031122.txt,"Europe. The average global growth pace of the past 3 months has fallen to only 1.8%, barely more than half of trend. The expectation
remains that Q1 should come in at 2.4% as both Japan and the Euro area exit recession.

° While staying overall long risk markets, both credit and equities at the moment, we have increasingly focused on tactical
cross-market exposures, and in particular the underweight of US equities. In GMOS this week, we took profit on the overweight of
Euro area equities against the US given the still very weak economy, with Q4 likely now the biggest GDP decline since the end of the
global recession (We do stay overweight Euro periphery bond). But we remain aggressively overweight both Japan and EM Asia
versus the US, with Japan currency hedged. The upside surprise on Chinese CPI today dented its equity market somewhat, but we
think this will be temporary as it should not yet lead to monetary tightening. The recent set of strong trade and industrial data from
China and the region are signaling to us significant upside risk on Q1 and 2013 growth projections.

e We have been long Japanese equities since Nov 16, which more by luck than skill defined the beginning of its equity rally.
Topix is up 20% since then, almost straight line. We believe new PM Abe conviction and political power to reflate the economy are
real. It has already helped the yen lose 10% versus the dollar. Given this move, faster fiscal easing and support from equities, we have
raised our 2013 growth forecast for a 3rd time, this time to 0.8%. We stay long the Japanese reflation trade.

Fixed Income

° Bonds recovered some of their losses from last week, but remain down on the year. We do not see the current surge in
equities as a negative for bonds, yet, as equity inflows are not coming out of bond funds, and growth remains too weak to elicit an
early end to QE. With USTs very much at the top of their 6-month trading range, we go tactically long duration, but would take profit
soon on a decent rally. In the Euro are, in contrast, the continued flow into the periphery should remain negative for Bund and euro
swaps. We retain a bearish bias here.

Equities

° Equities are up again this week, helped by rapidly improving equity ETF inflows. Strong buying by retail investors is
adding fuel to equity markets against a backdrop of rather subdued macro drivers, maintaining a positive-near term momentum. The
reporting season is also helping with US companies beating so far by 2% the bottom up analysts’ estimates at the beginning of the
year.

° Our recommended equity portfolio focuses on regional and sectoral exposures. Underweighting US equities remains our
main regional theme. This trade also protects our portfolio against looming debt ceiling risks. US equities had been the consensus
overweight by equity investors for two years and their outperformance started reversing over the summer. US equities have so far
erased their 2012 outperformance but are far from erasing their 2011 outperformance.

e We focus the US equity underweight against EM Asia and Japan. In GMOS this week, we took profit on our overweight
in MSCI EMU versus S&P500 given looming Italian election risks into February, and still disappointing European economic activity
data. We stay overweight in Topix vs. S&P500 currency hedged. Fiscal easing, financed via debt monetization, and coupled with
structural reforms has the potential to sustain this trade beyond a 3-6 month horizon, in our view. This week’s fiscal stimulus
announced by the Japanese gov’t appears supportive of the Japanese trade.

° Across sectors we favor Cyclical vs. Defensive sectors but have taken part profit as the pace of the improvement in the global
manufacturing PMI slowed in December. We stay overweight the DJ US Home Construction Index and large mortgage banks (BKX
Index) vs. the S&P500 to position for a continued recovery in US housing.

Credit

° High-grade spreads and yields were a few bps tighter this week, although US and European high-yield continued to rally
strongly. Double-digit spread tightening sent both to new all-time yield lows; now just 5.9% in the US and 6.5% in Europe. The clear
outlier this week was EMBIG, the ill health of the Venezuelan president and a NY court ruling in favor of hold-out creditors in
Argentina’s ‘pari passu’ saga helped push spreads up 12bp. We believe such idiosyncrasies driving relative performance signals an
uncharacteristic break-down in spread correlations and a welcome move-away from the one-factor-drives-all world of late.

° The strength of equity flows has caught our attention this week, but there is little evidence of a wider rotation out of bonds.
There has indeed been some evidence of bond into equity fund flows in ETFs (best seen through our flow radars in Flows &
Liquidity), but bond mutual funds continue to see inflows, which accelerated this week. Also, our client survey reports on-going
demand for credit and new issues remain well bid (see CMOS and F&L for more details).

Foreign Exchange

° 2013 has started with bubbling optimism across global markets. Equities are approaching five-year highs and credit
spreads their five-year lows, while government bonds are selling off worldwide and inflation breakevens behave (outside the UK).
And per the traditional pattern, the dollar is falling versus most currencies, except those which entered 2013 with enormous liabilities
— the yen given Japan’s full-throated commitment to looser monetary and fiscal policy, and the rand on sovereign credit and balance of
payment concerns. EUR/USD has spiked since Thursday’s ECB meeting but is underperforming much of the commodity complex
(MXN, CLP, AUD, NZD) year-to-date, highlighting that China's data surprises this week count for as much as a less-worried ECB.

° These country-specific issues are more powerful than systemic ones for the moment, which is likely why correlations
across dollar-based pairs have sunk to three-year lows. The yen story still looks to us the most unique — USD/JPY is the only major

IMAGES-007-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022956.txt,"Then there is the outside world pressed to the glass, appalled and
titillated by the monster inside the big house—a kind of Boo Radley of the
Upper East Side. I have taken friends by the Epstein mansion, and the
reaction to its other-worldly size in Manhattan is almost always the same: an
incredulous guffaw. Press accounts, seldom supplying new information, ever
recycle and repeat the mysterious (and monstrous) billionaire mythology,
with brief glimpses of him stepping out of the house (the same photos
endlessly republished), and the assumption of depravity inside.

In fact, the life in the house, without wife or children or conventional
domestic demeanor, in some way conforms to the most scripted fantasies: a
life somewhere between Daddy Warbucks and Eyes Wide Shut.

The domesticity of the house, and the background of Epstein’s
problems, centers around a group of young women who act as his support
staff and companions. Some have worked for him for many years, marrying,
having children, and continuing as part of his business and household
infrastructure. One woman, on an afternoon when I was there, recently
married, had just returned from an around the world honeymoon that Epstein
had arranged for her. Some are his romantic interests. His present girl friend
is in dental school. One former girlfriend, Eva Andersson Dubin, a Swedish
model and Miss Universe finalist, became a doctor and married hedge
funder Glen Dubin and together they finance the Dubin Breast Center at
Mount Sinai Hospital. Most at one time will travel with him to his floating
residences—the ranch in New Mexico, the vast apartment in Paris, the Island
in the Caribbean, the house in Palm Beach.

This is so outside of conventional living or staffing or romantic
relationships that it is hard to describe in a straightforward way. It
sometimes seems part of Epstein’s implicit challenge: not just look at me,
but do you dare look at me? Or it seems he is just oblivious to what other’s
are thinking. A sort of fatal tone deafness.

Epstein’s young women mingle freely with his powerful guests, not so
much as hostess or, in tabloid language, harem-like (or as “sex slaves’’), but
often as attentive students (that, of course, might be regarded as having its
own fetish-like attraction).

Once, Epstein invited me to sit in on a day of presentations to him in
his dining room by various “quants.” Quant theory involves making
investments based solely on mathematical and statistical models. This
method can often have uncanny predictive powers. But the problem is it
doesn’t scale very well—the market, having discerned a pattern of
successful investing, quickly copies and discounts the advantage. Epstein’s
effort was to identify a dozen or so promising algorithms (each quant is

PASS-THROUGH ENTITY TAXES

2017 Law 2018 Law

Subject to tax at individual rates up to 39.6% An individual taxpayer generally may deduct
20% of domestic qualified business income
from a partnership, S corporation, or sole
proprietorship?

In the case of a taxpayer who has qualified
business income from a partnership, S$
corporation or sole proprietorship, the
amount of the deduction is limited to the
greater of (i) 50% of the W-2 wages paid by
business or (ii) sum of 25% of W-2 wages paid
by business and 2.5% of business capital. This
wage limitation (i) does not apply if
taxpayer’s taxable income is less than
$157,500 ($315,000 for joint return); (ii)
applies fully if taxable income exceeds
$207,500 ($415,000 for joint return); and (iii)

Service Businesses a partial deduction if taxable income is

between those two limits..*
Service business includes accounting, law,

consulting, investing, etc., but excludes
engineering and architecture services

OBSERVATIONS — PASS-THROUGH ENTITIES

As originally proposed, the House and Senate took fundamentally different approaches to the taxation of pass-
through entities (sole proprietorships, partnerships, LLCs, LLPs and S-corporations). While they differed from each
other, they shared the goal of creating preferential treatment for certain pass-through business income. The Act
largely took the Senate’s approach but adopted a few elements of the House’s approach. The Act approaches
small business relief by permitting a non-itemized deduction of 20% of qualified business income; the remaining
80% would then be subject to normal tax rates. Therefore, the top tax rate for business income would be 29.6%
(80% x 37% = 29.6%). The provision is riddled with a host of complex limitations. For taxpayers not in the top
income tax bracket, the value of the deduction will depend on the marginal bracket that would otherwise be
imposed on the income.

Owners of service businesses (e.g., law, accounting and consulting, etc., but not engineering or architectural
services) generally would be eligible for the 20% deduction unless taxable income exceeds $315,000 for married
filing jointly ($157,500 for others). The benefit of the 20% deduction is phased out and fully eliminated over the

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030107.txt,"Former White House counsel and an attorney for the bank, Kathryn Ruemmler, said that Emirates never would
have acquired source code in a joint-partnership deal like the one reached with InfoSpan. She said such
technology would instead be held by a third-party escrow company for the length of the partnership.
In her closing arguments, the partner with global firm Latham & Watkins told the jury that Bajwa and
InfoSpan sold the bank a “bill of goods,” arguing that despite promises to Emirates, the technology never
worked and InfoSpan wasn’t as big a company as it claimed.
The bank cancelled the deal and filed a criminal complaint, not as a form of extortion but simply to regain the
bank’s money after it was misled and doubts grew about the character of InfoSpan’s employees, Ruemmler
told the jury.
“They concluded, definitively, that they had been defrauded,” she said.
Lubna Qassim, group general counsel for Emirates Bank, said in a statement after the verdict that Emirates
Bank is gratified by today's decision and the opportunity to receive a fair trial in U.S. courts.
Bajwa said the trial has taken a toll on him and he doesn’t know his next steps.
“T am just beat up,” he said.

IMAGES-010-HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028748.txt,"DP: In the long term, the United States could greatly benefit Islam by
uniquely freeing the religion from government constraints and permitting
it to evolve in a positive, modern direction. But that’s the long term. Right
now, American Muslims labor under Saudi and other influences, their
institutions are extreme, and things are heading in a destructive direction.
It’s also distressing to see how non-Muslim individuals and institutions,
particularly those on the left, indulge Islamist misbehavior.

TB: How do they do that?

DP: Well, turn on the television, go to a class, follow the work of the
ACLU or the Southern Poverty Law Center, and you will see corporations,
nonprofits, and government institutions working with the Islamists,
helping promote the Islamist agenda. The American left and the Islamists
agree on what they dislike—conservatives—and, despite their profound
differences, they cooperate.

TB: Presumably some Muslims here deconvert, right?

DP: There are some conversions out of Islam, yes. And the Muslim
establishment in this country 1s quite concerned about that. But
numerically it is not a significant number.

TB: The ones who convert don’t talk about it very much?

DP: In some cases they do; they take advantage of Western freedoms to
speak their minds. They are the exceptions, though.

TB: I suspect that the decline of Christianity has encouraged Islam.

DP: Very much so, as the contrast between Europe and the United States
reveals. The hard kernel of American Christian faith, not present in
Europe, means that Islamists are far better behaved in the United States.
They see the importance of a Christian counterforce.

TB: Earlier, you mentioned Algeria. It is a big Muslim state that we
don’t hear about today.

DP: Twenty years ago Algeria was a major focus of attention. That long
ago ended, although in France coverage is still significant. Algeria is ripe
for the same kind of upheaval that we have seen in other North African

for a company,” he said. “But there is some point where it gets crazy and self-
delusional.” He added that the companies “are probably in some trouble — maybe
it’s a little, maybe it’s a lot.” The prospect of government regulation looms.

In 2015 and 2016, Mr. Thiel gave $300,000 to Josh Hawley, who was
campaigning to become Missouri’s attorney general. Mr. Hawley won, and in
November he opened an antitrust investigation of Google. A spokeswoman for Mr.
Hawley, a Republican who is now challenging the state’s Democratic senator,
Claire McCaskill, said there was “no connection” between Mr. Thiel’s donation and
the investigation. Google declined to comment.

The news last month that Mr. Thiel is moving from San Francisco to Los
Angeles reflects a shift that is as much mental as literal. Getting out of the tech
bubble, he figures, will give him more clarity about his investments.

“Network effects are very positive things, but there’s a tipping point where
they fall over into the madness of crowds,” he said.

Another of Mr. Thiel’s contentious ideas was destroying Gawker, the online
publisher. He secretly financed the privacy lawsuit that Hulk Hogan, the former
pro wrestler, filed against the media company, which Mr. Hogan won. That led to
Gawker’s bankruptcy in 2016.

A news operation that specialized in deflating the arrogance of Silicon Valley
should have been to Mr. Thiel’s liking. But he argues that his philosophy is

consistent here.

“Gawker was trying to cut people down to size for not conforming,” he said.
“The ability to speak and not have every word you say get distorted, to have wrong
ideas and then be able to correct them — these notions were powerfully undercut
by Gawker.”

Mr. Thiel is still pursuing the remnants of Gawker in court, which has
prompted accusations that he wants to remove all of its content from the internet
as a final victory.

He denied this. “Terry Bollea, a.k.a. Hulk Hogan, is still owed some money

liable to them for appropriate damages. See Preceding Undisputed Facts. Because of the
outrageousness of Epstein’s sexual abuse of minor girls, Edwards reasonably expected that
Epstein would also be liable for punitive damages to the girls. Because Edwards could show that
Epstein had molested children for years and designed a complex premeditated scheme to procure
different minors everyday to satisfy his addiction to sex with minors, the punitive damages
would have to be sufficient to deter him from this illegal conduct that he had engaged in daily for
years. Epstein was and is a billionaire. See Complaint, §49 (referring to “Palm Beach
Billionaire”); see also Epstein Deposition, February 17, 2010, at 172-176 (Deposition
Attachment #7) (taking the Fifth when asked whether he is a billionaire). Accordingly, Edwards
reasonably believed the punitive damages that would have to be awarded against Epstein would
have been substantial enough to punish him severely enough for his past conduct as well as deter
him from repeating his offenses in the future. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit “N” at (19.

85. On July 6, 2010, rather than face trial for the civil suits that had been filed against
him by L.M., E.W., and Jane Doe, defendant Epstein settled the cases against him. The terms of
the settlement are confidential. The settlement amounts are highly probative in the instant action
as Epstein bases his claims that Edwards was involved in the Ponzi scheme on Epstein's inability
to settle the L.M., E.W., and Jane Doe cases for minimal value. His continued inability to
settle the claims for “minimal value” after the Ponzi scheme was uncovered would be highly
probative in discrediting any causal relationship between the Ponzi scheme and Edwards’s
settlement negotiations. See Edwards Affidavit, Exhibit “N” at §21.
